NPR's David Welna, who is traveling with Tillerson and Mattis, notes that the rift among U.S. allies "comes just 10 days after President Trump addressed an anti-terrorism summit of Arab leaders in Saudi Arabia, and some see Trump's siding there with Sunni monarchs and his rhetoric against Iran as having given a kind of green light to blackballing this Gulf nation."

"Let’s face it - a government who listened to the industry would never have made such simple costly mistakes like cafe-gate. A bartender could have told you the law and that there’s no such thing as a cafe licence. And yet the government had us pushed from pillar to post trying to work to something unworkable. They had the info and the advice and chose to ignore private industries experience and knowledge. That’s the crux of it all. It’s so obvious it’s embarrassing and yesterday’s backtracking is damning.
 "There is a multitude of ways that this could have and still could be handled but I fear as do the rest of the industry that we will be ignored again and again. Anything that has been taken onboard has been muddled and contrived into a needlessly complicated and ineffective policy that costs us money and time.

The longest bull market in history began shortly after Obama entered office and continued well into Trump’s presidency. Investors welcomed Trump’s corporate tax cuts in 2017, and although the trade war with China put them on edge, stocks enjoyed a record-breaking run all the way up to 2020. At the start of the pandemic in 2020, the S&P 500 plunged 34% in about a month, before recovering later in the summer. As of October 27, the index was up 49% in Trump’s presidency, overall. While that quick bounce-back is a bright spot for him, it also contrasts with 76% stock gains under Obama and 64% gains under Clinton at the same point in their presidencies.

Some Democrats freaked out the other night when Joe Biden said that we should slowly transition from oil to renewable energy. Oh no, they cried, he’s blown the election!
 Chill out, folks. It’s 2020, not 1950.
 Most Americans alive today don’t worship Big Oil. They want to transition to renewable energy. Biden, a conventionally mainstream politician, merely stated a mainstream position. Anyone who thinks that Trump can ride Biden’s remarks to victory should be awarded a political science degree from Trump University.
 On the debate stage Thursday night, during an exchange about climate change (which Trump has long dismissed as a hoax), Biden said oil needs to be “replaced by renewable energy over time.” He also reiterated his plan to end federal subsidies for the oil industry.
 “Basically, what he is saying is he’s going to destroy the oil industry,” Trump shot back, taking Biden out of context.
 Trump and his desperate enablers may think that Biden has handed them a game- changer, but, as always, they’re not living in the real world. Biden didn’t say anything controversial. At a time when the reality of climate change is self-evident (intensifying wildfires, floods, hurricanes, derechos), what Biden said is now conventional wisdom.
 Even Big Oil knows what needs to happen. BP has announced a plan to cut carbon emissions to zero by 2050. We’ve already been trending away from oil; according to the federal government’s own stats, domestic oil consumption has been falling for the past 15 years. And most Americans are fine with the idea of ending all federal subsidies to the fossil fuel industry. A national poll four years ago found that 62 percent of registered voters — including 54 percent of Republicans — want to cut off that money.
 In the aftermath of Biden’s remarks on debate night, 52 percent of independent voters are in favor of phasing out oil in the long run, according to a Morning Consult/Politico poll. Even among Republican voters, 41 percent said yes. And when all voters were asked which candidate is trusted to tackle climate change, Biden beat Trump by 30 points (59-29).
 Those stats are in sync with what the Pew Research Center found in June: “A broad majority of Americans (79 percent) say the more important priority for the country is to develop alternative sources, such as wind and solar; far fewer (20 percent) say the more important energy priority is to expand the production of oil, coal and natural gas. Views on this question are about the same as they were in October 2019.”
 In the stretch drive to election day, Trump will crank up the hyperbole (Sleepy Joe will destroy the oil industry!), particularly in fossil fuel- producing states like Texas and Pennsylvania, in the hopes of scaring a pivotal share of people to vote red. Granted, he may sway some (and a few Democratic congressional candidates in oil-producing states have tiptoed away from Biden’s debate remarks). But other voters — particularly young people — may be more energized by Biden’s stated determination to combat climate change.
 And, lest we forget, Trump is still ranting nonsense about wind turbines “killing all the birds,” and about how Biden supposedly would “knock down buildings and build buildings with little tiny small windows” — a twisted reference to Biden’s plan to retrofit buildings and make them more energy efficient.
 One other thing. Trump owns the most deadly pandemic of the last 100 years — with new record highs in America — yet he’s still telling voters that we’re “rounding the corner.”
 Nothing in climate policy that Biden foresees for 2050 can possibly trump the illness, joblessness, and death that the demagogue is sowing in 2020.

Thousands of people gathered in a field on Dusshera to witness the burning of Ravan's effigy violating Covid-19 restrictions at Kharagpur in West Midnapore district in West Bengal. The incident has shocked public health experts who criticized the local administration for allowing such a gathering at a time when the state is witnessing a sharp spike in Covid-19 cases. West Bengal added 4,121 new Covid-19 cases on Monday, which was the second highest number of cases in India after Kerala. While Kerala with 4,287 cases topped the list, Maharashtra with 3,645 cases ranked third. The top brass of the local administration including the district magistrate and senior Trinamool Congress leaders such as the local MLA attended the ritual organised around 140 km west of Kolkata. "As the event involves the sentiment of the people and is being organized for many years, we had made preparations so that it could be live streamed through a local cable television channel and on a video sharing platform. But people refused to stay at home and came out in large numbers. Nobody was prepared for this," said Rashmi Kamal, district magistrate of West Midnapore, Thousands of people from Kharagpur and nearby villages gathered at the spot on Monday, to see the burning of the 54-feet effigy. While physical distancing between people took a back-seat many were not even wearing face masks raising the risk of transmission. The district administration, however, said that masks and sanitizers were distributed. "This involves people's sentiment and the Ravan Dahan at Kharagpur has been going on for several years. It was once the biggest Ravan Dahan in the country. So it was not possible to stop the festival overnight," said Ajit Maity, district president of the ruling TMC. "This was done keeping in mind the people's sentiment. People also need to be aware and understand that Covid-19 restrictions need to be followed. The violations have come to our notice. The next time we organise any such gathering we will be better prepared," said Pradip Sarkar, TMC MLA. The Durga Puja has been muted this year because of the Covid-19 pandemic and the restrictions imposed by the Calcutta High Court. The court had banned the entry of visitors inside puja pandals this time. "The way people had gathered at the spot was shocking. Even if there was one Covid-19 patient the disease will spread to many people. The administration should have been more careful" said Kajalkrishna Banik, public health expert.

The party houses pose a risk to Airbnb’s reputation and business as the $18 billion company prepares to go public this year. In many neighborhoods, people have been turned off by the rentals' noise and annoyances. Complaints about party houses across sites like Airbnb and Vrbo soared 250% between July and September compared to last year, according to Host Compliance, which provides local neighborhood hotlines across the United States and Canada.


  Worse, the party houses raise safety issues. Between March and October, at least 27 shootings were connected to Airbnb rentals in the United States and Canada, according to a tally of local news reports by Jessica Black, an activist fighting short-term rentals. The tally was verified by The New York Times.


  Over the years, Airbnb employees have pushed executives to do more to address the party houses, said six people who worked on safety issues at the company. But they said the startup largely prioritized growth until a deadly shooting last Halloween at an Airbnb made national headlines. Five people died.

With Le'Veon Bell in the fold, Reid has fortified his depth and explosiveness at running back, which indicates to me he expects to be moving forward taking what the defenses give them and adopting a bit more of a bruising offensive mentality. And with Schwartz out, limiting some of the dropbacks surely makes sense. And Reid is nothing short of an offensive genius. In the long run, it's probably good for the Chiefs that the points are becoming a little harder to come by, on offense at least, but it's more than a little odd to me, at least, to see them stand only eighth in the NFL in offensive points scored per game, and tied with the Browns and Bills for fourth in the league in touchdown passes per game.

Jim was born February 28, 1924, in Logan, Ohio to John and Gertrude McGonagle. He is survived by his wife of 74 years Helen, (nee Hillier), Patrick (Carolyn) McGonagle of Newark, Ohio; Kathie (Richard) Koegle of New Braunfels, Texas; Barbara (Tom) Eckhoff of Louisville, Kentucky; Diane (Donald) DeWitte of St. Charles, Illinois; and Marsha (Larry) Mikeworth of Newark, Ohio. He was a doting grandpa to 8 grandchildren; Christine and Erin McGonagle, Vince Koegle and Kelly Wagner, Mike Eckhoff and Lisa McKinney, Patrick and Michael DeWitte, and 7 great-grandchildren. Jim was raised in Logan attending local schools, and in high school was a gifted athlete excelling in football and basketball for Logan High School. After his return from service in the United States Navy during WWII, Jim earned a degree in business from Ohio University in Athens, Ohio. Following additional training in New York, he began a decades long career in retail merchandizing in the men's and women's clothing industry, a blessing to his growing family of a son and four daughters. He began his career working for John J. Carroll Department store in Newark, Ohio eventually serving as its General Manager. In 1966, he was recruited by Sears Roebuck and Company and rose to the position of National Merchandising Manager, staging and equipping Sears retail clothing stores across the country. He was always proudest of having overseen the establishment of the Sears store at Woodfield Mall in Schaumburg, Illinois, the largest retail center within the Sears system at the time, and would always want to pay a visit, in his travels back to Chicago in his retirement. Jim enlisted in the US Navy at the age of 19 to serve his country. Following boot camp at Great Lakes Training Center in North Chicago, Jim was assigned to the USS Texas, a New York class battleship that saw action in both Atlantic and Pacific theaters, in numerous missions during the war. Following the Japanese surrender in 1945, the Texas was converted to a troop transport ship, shuttling soldiers from Hawaii to San Francisco returning from the Pacific theater. Jim would recall seeing the Golden Gate bridge "more times than I can remember" returning our troops to the United States, and eventually back to their hometowns. It was not until the 50th Anniversary of D-Day, that Jim shared with his family he had been at Normandy during the invasion, providing Naval artillery support to ground troops on the beach. That acknowledgement began years of stories he recollected from his service, sharing with the entire family for many years after. For several years, Jim served as President of the USS Texas Alumni Organization, taking Jim and Helen to Corpus Christi, Texas for annual reunions of all who had ever served on the ship. A day never went by without Jim displaying a flag lapel pin on every piece of clothing he wore, right up until this past Saturday afternoon, proudly displaying his service to his country. After returning to Newark from military service in January 1946, Jim met a most attractive young brunette woman named Helen Hillier, a Newark native who stole his heart. They were married on August 10, 1946 at St. Francis de Sales Catholic Church in Newark, that became their home parish for decades after. All 5 of their children were baptized, received First Communion and were Confirmed at St. Francis. In 1984 Jim and Helen retired to Fairfield Glade, Tennessee. Jim and his older brother George became a force to reckon with on golf courses across eastern Tennessee, winning numerous tournaments on various courses for many years. Jim played comfortably, and competitively, well into his 80's until various ailments and a bad back, cut his playing days short. Jim brought his devotion to his Catholic faith with him to Tennessee, serving for many years on the St. Francis of Assissi Catholic Church council in Fairfield Glade, and was Chairman of the fund raising and construction committees that oversaw the church's new building. Jim and George sang in the Church choir together for several years, always making their children and grandchildren attending mass with them proud. Over the course of their years in Tennessee, Jim and Helen were always happy for visits from family, hosting numerous McGonagle family reunions that brought the entire family from across the country together to make great stories and fond memories. In 2014, due to failing health, Jim and Helen moved into assisted living in Louisville, Kentucky, under the watchful eye of daughter Barbara, who assumed caregiver responsibility for both of them, to which her brother and sisters are eternally thankful and appreciative. Jim was preceded in death by his parents John and Gertrude and 5 siblings, brothers Edmund and George McGonagle, and sisters Mary Burhard, Kathleen Dete, and Elizabeth Nixon. Due to Covid-19 restrictions, memorial services will be held at a later date in Newark, Ohio. In the meantime, the family requests contributions be made in Jim's name to the following organizations; The Battleship Texas Museum Foundation, One Riverway-Suite 2200, Houston, Texas 77056; or Saint Francis of Assissi Catholic Church, 7503 Peavine Road, Crossville, Tennessee, 38558; or St. Francis de Sales Catholic Church, 40 Granville St., Newark, Ohio 43055.

The three-year contract extension Molina signed with the Cardinals in March 2017--with the intention it would be his last deal as a player--ran through the end of the 2020 season. Although the contract has expired, his desire to keep playing has not.


  Molina told reporters in January that he sought to play two more seasons in MLB after 2020. He also said he would only play those seasons with St. Louis. If the two sides couldn't work out another contract, he said at the time, he would retire a Cardinal. Case closed.


  During MLB's COVID shutdown, however, Molina changed his mind. He said the pandemic forced him to reconsider his priorities. Molina still intended to play two more years, but added that if the Cardinals weren't willing to keep him, he would take his talents elsewhere. That declaration from earlier this year carries more weight now that the 38-year-old catcher has been officially declared a free agent.


  All teams have a five-day exclusive negotiating window with their departing free agents before the players are free to sign with new teams. For the Cardinals, Molina's longtime batterymate Adam Wainwright is a free agent, as well. The team has gone year-to-year with the 39-year-old pitcher each of the last two seasons, but this year could also be different for Wainwright. Some have speculated that both Molina and Wainwright could relocate from the Cardinals, joining a new franchise as a package deal. A reunion with Albert Pujols in Los Angeles would be a tough image to stomach.


  Other free agents for St. Louis include Brad Miller and Matt Wieters. Miller was an effective bat for the Cardinals in 2020, a savvy signing in February for just $2 million. A reunion at a similar price point shouldn't be out of the question. That's what happened between the Cardinals and Wieters, who signed a pair of one-year deals with St. Louis before 2019 and 2020. For next season, though, it's possible the Cardinals shift to up-and-coming catcher Andrew Knizner for full-time backup duties--unless, of course, the Cardinals find themselves in need of a primary starter at the position.

English said national attention has forced change at UGA before, and if the university is put under pressure, more change can happen.
 Jay Mathias, who started Dawgs Demand Better, said the organization is planning a protest walk from Atlanta to Athens from Wednesday to Friday. Dawgs Demand Better is a campaign for racial justice at UGA.
 Mathias said two protesters will walk from Atlanta to Stone Mountain on Wednesday, to Monroe on Thursday, and arrive in Athens on Friday. Atlanta is 72 miles away from Athens. Mathias said the goal of the walk is to raise awareness.
 Other speakers at the town hall included Caitlyn Scott, who discussed an Equal Opportunity Office claim about the lack of diversity and inclusion on UGA’s cheer team. She said the team displayed biased judging and indifference toward minority students.
 Representatives from the Student Alumni Council discussed philanthropy and how students can give to organizations on campus. Freshmen, sophomores and juniors can donate $10 to the SAC, which is given to whatever organization they choose, said Maddie Polk, SAC’s philanthropy outreach chair.

 The class gift is a new program, Jalen Polk said. The senior class votes for which organization receives the pool of money. On-campus organizations must apply by Nov. 28 to be considered.

ISLAMABAD (AP) — Pakistan’s state-run council of clerics, which advises the government on religious issues, gave its approval Wednesday to the construction of a new temple for minority Hindus, ruling Islamic law allows them a place of worship.


  Lal Malhi, a prominent Hindu leader who is also a member of parliament, applauded the ruling but noted the council also recommended the government not spend public funds directly on the construction of private places of worship.


  The decision by the Council of Islamic Ideology comes after the government of Prime Minister Imran Khan abruptly halted construction on the temple in the capital Islamabad in June. Khan's decision came amid threats from radical Muslims who called construction of the temple a blasphemous act.


  Some extremists had vowed to try to stop the temple's construction with force, raising tensions. Khan turned to the council to decide if public money could be used for construction. He had promised $600,000 for the temple's construction.


  It was not immediately clear Wednesday whether Khan would follow through with providing the funds in light of the council's ruling. However, the council's ruling left open the possibility the money could be distributed to the Hindu community to use as it sees fit.


  Khan, who has promised equal rights for minorities, is expected to issue a formal order to allow the temple’s construction.

The issues are now fueling Airbnb’s many fights with communities over how to regulate home rentals. Groups like the one in Incline Village are becoming more vocal and are sharing their strategies for fighting short-term rentals. Cities including Chicago, San Diego, Atlanta and Ann Arbor, Michigan, have recently proposed or enacted stricter rules or bans on the properties.


  “Airbnb’s long-run viability and profitability is going to have a big question mark” if the party issue is not resolved, said Karen Xie, a professor at the University of Denver who researches the short-term rental industry.


  Christopher Nulty, an Airbnb spokesman, said the company is combating the party houses with “robust new policies, products and technologies to stop large gatherings, which far exceeds measures taken by others.” He said Airbnb has made changes even though the moves “knowingly impacted growth and nights booked.”


  Airbnb began rolling out new rules against party houses around the same time that it was preparing to file to go public. In July, it said guests under the age of 25 with fewer than three positive reviews on the site could not book entire homes near where they live. In August, the same month it filed for a public listing, it placed a 16-person cap on reservations, banned parties and sued guests who were responsible for the events.


  Last month, it started testing technology to block suspicious last-minute bookings and suspended some party houses from its listings. And ahead of Halloween — the one-year anniversary of the shooting at the Airbnb in Orinda, California — it banned one-night rentals on Halloween.

Dallas Cowboys coach Mike McCarthy's pre-practice conference call Wednesday morning momentarily devolved into a lighthearted roast session after beat reporter Calvin Watkins asked an admittedly "dumb" question.
  _Is it harder to gameplan around rookie quarterback Ben DiNucci as opposed to veteran Andy Dalton?_
 "Is it harder? Was I not supposed to laugh at that?" McCarthy responded, laughing. "It's kind of hard to tell with your mask on, so I didn't know if you were serious. Yeah, it's a bit harder to prepare with a first-year QB than Andy, yes."
 To be fair, it was a prescient query from Watkins. NFL Network's Ian Rapoport later reported that Dalton, who remains in the NFL's concussion protocol, will not practice Wednesday, which is "not a good sign" for his Week 8 availability. The protocol includes various stages one must pass through before gaining medical clearance.
 Seventh-round rookie Ben DiNucci, who relieved Dalton in Sunday's loss to Washington, will assume first-string reps as the team begins full-scale preparations for the Philadelphia Eagles. Recently-signed journeyman Garrett Gilbert is the lone backup.
 "Not sure how all the (concussion) protocols work and stuff of that nature, but if my number's called I'll be the first one in the building tomorrow and the last one to leave," DiNucci said, via the team's official website. "I have to prepare like I have been for the past two months. Nothing changes."
 The James Madison product, known for his accuracy, completed 2-of-3 passes for 39 yards against Washington; his first attempt upon entering in the third quarter was a beautifully-laid, 32-yard sideline strike to wide receiver Amari Cooper. That proved to be DiNucci's lone highlight. He was sacked three times and harassed countless others as the Cowboys were blown out in the nation's capital, 25-3, dropping to 2-5 on the season.
 "Obviously, he's going to learn on the fly. Obviously, he had a nice throw to Amari down the sideline. There is plenty of learning to do for Ben," offensive coordinator Kellen Moore said Monday, citing "decision-making and pocket management," per beat reporter Michael Gehlken.
 Should he draw the start on _Sunday Night Football_ , DiNucci -- whom McCarthy loosely compared to Marc Bulger and Cowboys VP Stephen Jones to Tony Romo -- has a decent parachute, surrounded by an assortment of weapons. The Cowboys are also expected to regain All-Pro right guard Zack Martin, who missed Week 7 due to a concussion, and possibly center Joe Looney, eligible for activation from short-term injured reserve.
 DiNucci went from holding a clipboard to firing his first career pass on a moment's notice. Now the 23-year-old is faced with the prospect of remaining under center as Dallas heads to Philadelphia for a must-win midseason grudge match that carries major NFC East title implications.
 No pressure, kid.
 "He has a lot of work to do," McCarthy said Monday. "If he is gonna go this week, he'll have the reps to prepare."

La Selección Peruana tendrá una nueva contienda internacional, esta vez, ante su similar de Chile, por la tercera jornada de las Eliminatorias a Qatar 2022. El ‘Clásico del Pacífico’ tendrá una connotación de revancha para el cuadro ‘mapocho’, tras la última derrota en la Copa América; sin embargo, no la tendrán fácil, tal y como afirma José Del Solar. Su paso por la ‘bicolor’, así como su experiencia como DT en el país sureño le he hecho acreedor a tener un juicio respeto a este encuentro, según el medio La Cuarta de Chile. En la entrevista, ‘Chemo’ no solo destacó el buen rendimiento del elenco de Ricardo Gareca, sino porque cuenta con una idea de juego clara y que han sostenido en el tiempo. “Históricamente son partidos muy disputados y este no será la excepción. Perú llega en un buen momento. Más allá de haber perdido contra Brasil, un resultado injusto, donde los errores arbitrales perjudicaron al equipo. Incluso, venía de sacar un punto en Paraguay. Después de un proceso largo de seis años ya con el técnico Ricardo Gareca, el equipo tiene una idea clara de juego. Mantiene la base de las eliminatorias y del mundial”, precisó. Además, consideró que la ‘bicolor’ llega en su mejor momento, con respecto a su rival. “¿Está mejor que Chile? Yo creo que sí. El momento actual de Perú es mejor que el de Chile, que ha tenido varias bajas. Viene de una derrota afuera y un empate en casa. Pero el partido será parejo. Perú está en condiciones de sacar un buen resultado. Me atrevo a decir que Perú no se irá de Santiago sin sumar”, sentenció. Los duelos entre Chile y Perú siempre han tenido una carga emotiva importante, más allá de los eventos históricos, por lo que el estratega nacional ve como ventaja que el compromiso en Santiago se juegue sin público. “Es una ventaja, no sólo para nuestra selección, sino para todos los equipos que jugarán de visita en esta circunstancia. En las eliminatorias la gente también juega un papel importante desde la tribuna. El público chileno es apasionado, aprieta mucho”. Chile recibirá a Perú el próximo viernes 13 de noviembre en el Nacional de Santiago, por la fecha 3 de las Clasificatorias a Qatar 2022. El duelo será visto a través de la señal de Movistar Deportes y de América TV.
