"I think that the president was prohibited from getting a lot of his agenda done because so much time and effort had to be put against defending against these," he said.
 Several Trump supporters interviewed by The Associated Press in recent days were rankled by widespread celebrations of Biden's win in liberal cities. They saw hypocrisy in the public, outdoor gatherings after Democrats condemned Trump supporters for attending big rallies -- some were held indoors -- amid the coronavirus pandemic.
 "Sad" is how Lori Piotrowski sums up her mood. The president of the Boulder City Republican Women club in Nevada at first sounds much like any other deflated supporter.
 "You always want your candidate to win. You're a little let down. You worked hard," she said.
 But Piotrowski also described herself as "extremely" surprised by the result of the election. She's struggling to reconcile her version of the campaign with the results. She says she saw so many images of large Trump rallies in the final days. On a recent drive from Las Vegas to Reno -- through rural, GOP-leaning Nevada -- she saw only Trump signs and banners, she said.
 "The votes didn't reflect that amount of enthusiasm. I just find that very surprising," she said. "It makes me wonder."
 Biden won Nevada by racking up votes in the state's urban areas.
 Piotrowski, like many Trump supporters, wants to see Trump's legal challenges continue. A massive surge in mail voting and the slower tally of those votes has made the vote count look unfamiliar and strange. Piotrowski said it concerns her that races were called with so many ballots outstanding, although that is often the case.
 "It just seems to me that there's a lot of things that can be improved in the system so that people felt more confident," she said.
 She said she hasn't listened to any of Biden's speeches since Election Day.
 Za Awng, of Aurora, Colorado, is also suspicious of the vote count.
 Awng, who came to the U.S. as a refugee from Myanmar, has embraced Trump as a politician who echoes his conviction that China's influence in the world must be sharply curtailed, and as one who shares his Christian values.
 This spring, Awng lost his job as a chef for two months when the pandemic forced the closure of the restaurant where he works. Back at work now, he credits Trump with working hard over the last four years to improve the economy. It was hard for him to grasp how the president could lose.
 "I believe there is something wrong," he said, pointing to what appear to be Democratic shifts in the tally but were a result of mail-in votes being counted later. Democrats were more likely than Republicans to cast mail ballots after Trump baselessly declared mail voting fraudulent.
 "I hope there will be counting again and maybe it will change," he said.
 Even in less tense times, Jim Czebiniak seeks solace in hours of evening prayer. So when Czebiniak, an avid Trump supporter who lives in the upstate community of Knox, New York, heard that Biden had been declared the winner, he turned once again to worship in a search for answers.
 "First of all, I went to the Lord and I asked him why, why is it going like this? The Lord said, 'Because I'm working on stuff. Just relax and let things work themselves out,'" said Czebiniak, 72, who is semi-retired from a career writing custom software.
 "To quote what's-his-name from the Rolling Stones, Mick Jagger: 'You can't always get what you want,'" Czebiniak said.
 Still, Czebiniak said he is far from ready to accept a Biden presidency. He cited several unsupported claims made by the Trump campaign.
 "The election isn't really called yet," Czebiniak said, days after all the major U.S. television networks and the AP examined vote counts in key states to declare Biden the overall winner. "I don't trust anything that's going on there with all this vote counting."
 Unlike many Trump supporters, Michelle Sassouni wasn't shocked by the outcome of the election or the aftermath.
 The 29-year-old in Tampa, Florida, is an active member of her region's Young Republicans Club and a co-host of a video show, "Moderately Outraged." She floated the idea of Biden's nomination, and potential to win, months ago.
 "Everyone laughed at me on the show," she said. With many liberal friends, she had seen the strong opposition to Trump. She even understands it somewhat. "I don't love everything he does, but I voted for him because I'm a Republican."
 But Sassouni doesn't see danger in Trump's vow to fight the results in court. People need to be reassured of the results, and a court fight might give them confidence, she said.
 "If you voted for Joe Biden, wouldn't you want to know that he won fair and square so that there's not this cloud over his head?" she asked. "If half the country believes there was some sort of election tampering, then that creates distrust in the system, that creates distrust in Western democracy as a whole."
 Martin, the retiree in Mississippi, says she's planning to resume her daily life, tending to her animals and avoiding talking about the country's change in leadership as a way to deal with the stress and trepidation she feels.
 "I'll go out in the yard to check and talk to my chickens and say my old- fashioned hymns and get by," she said.

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — German industrial equipment and technology maker Siemens AG recorded a 28% increase in net profit to 1.88 billion euros ($2.21 billion) in the most recent quarter, boosted by a gain of 800 million euros from discontinued operations, the Munich-based company said Thursday. It gave an upbeat outlook for 2021, saying the pandemic “will not have a long-lasting effect” on the global economy. The gain compared with profit of 1.47 billion euros in the July-September quarter last year. It was the last set of earnings at the 173-year-old company under CEO Joe Kaeser, who is turning over the top post in February to current deputy Roland Busch. Since taking over in 2013, Kaeser has led a restructuring that included spinoffs of stakes in the energy and medical equipment businesses “The Siemens team delivered a strong finish to a remarkable year,” Kaeser said in a statement. The company said it foresaw “a moderate increase” in net profit for the group in its 2021 fiscal year. The quarterly profit rounded off the company’s full fiscal year, which saw an annual profit of 4.2 billion euros even as the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the global economy. The annual figure declined from 5.7 billion euros in the previous fiscal year; the fiscal 2020 figure was held back by a loss of 100 million euros from discontinued operations compared with a gain of 500 million from such operations in 2019. Siemens shareholders in July approved the spinoff of a majority stake in its energy business, which includes gas turbines and wind power. Kaeser has called the move a way to reduce risk and support the company's share price. Siemens' other products include railroad equipment and factory automation.

Based on the official test solutions released in the days following the exam, the students must estimate their scores. They then compare their predicted performance against the “Minimum Score Line” published by the colleges that they intend to apply to. The next step is to rank a series of colleges in preferential order based on their predicted score -- quite the gamble, since being below the minimum score of a specific college eliminates the possibility of admission entirely. If the student’s estimates are accurate and they score above the cutoff, they are entered into a matching system where the schools reciprocally rank students on their lists. The student’s admission letter then comes from the school based on this two-way matching algorithm. Those aspiring to become medical students are, like their American counterparts, typically top of their class. The key difference is that while 41% of American applicants are accepted to medical school, less than 5% of Chinese students are. The graduating class size of Chinese high schools dwarfs the number of available seats at medical schools each year. However, even those Chinese students that make the cut are admitted to programs with drastically different career outlooks.

Bryson DeChambeau is golf's latest litmus test, hammering drives that sound and soar like mortar fire and cut corners in ways golf-course designers and his fellow pros never dreamed.


  By the time the Masters ends Sunday, fans might still be debating whether that's good for the game. Either way, though, real estate agents will be thrilled.


  DeChambeau, in just his fifth season on tour, is on a mission to prove that courses worldwide -- even championship venues now routinely stretching almost 7,800 yards -- have run out of room. Last month, he overwhelmed a legendarily tough Winged Foot course and won the U.S. Open by six strokes. This week, he plans to cut even-more venerated Augusta National down to size.


  "I'm just trying to get up there like I'm in a batter's box swinging as hard as I can, trying to hit a home run," DeChambeau explained this week. "I don't know if there's a better way to say it."


  The pandemic already guaranteed a Masters unlike any other. There will be no fans -- strike that, patrons -- on the grounds, and pomp and circumstance have been reduced to a minimum. But DeChambeau took advantage of the time off to add bulk to his frame and velocity to his swing; with a few tournaments under his belt, he's far enough along in his quest to harness that added power with increasing effectiveness. That's in addition to a championship-caliber short game.

The sophomore transfer completed 12 of 24 passes for 204 yards and two touchdowns in a six-point loss at Clemson two weeks ago, leads the ACC with 2,083 passing yards, and is an adept scrambler who can throw effectively on the run. He was stuck behind Ian Book at Notre Dame and has thrived under first-year Boston College coach Jeff Hafley.

A NFLPA spokesman declined comment this week.


  The team has signed more than 20 players since the start of training camp in late July. It is unclear whether any of those players have been notified by a team official that there are cameras in the locker room.


  The News obtained a photo of the video surveillance equipment inside the locker room that appears to include a small camera embedded in a smoke detector on the ceiling. The device looks exactly like a widely available model of “professional covert security camera.”


  The Jets contend that players have asked for security footage in the past to track down lost items in the locker room, according to a source. Each player has a mini-safe with a unique PIN in his locker to ensure that private items such as jewelry, wallets and phones are protected.


  No player reached for this story recalled a teammate asking for surveillance footage. Some players were angry upon learning that there was an eye in the sky while they’re in a private space changing in and out of their clothes.


  One current player called it “bizarre” for the Jets to hide cameras.


  A former player who spent time with the club a few years ago recalled a conversation between two teammates discussing the possibility of covert cameras in the locker room, but he was never officially told by a team employee.


  “I didn’t actually know, but a couple guys would sit there and talk about it,” the player said. “You’d be like, ‘No way. Really?”


  Another former player from a few years ago wasn’t shocked upon hearing the news of hidden cameras given some of the strange occurrences under the current regime. He said that he wouldn’t be floored if there were microphones in the locker room or meeting rooms, either.


  “It doesn’t surprise me,” that player said. “Some people over there are pretty worried about what’s done behind closed doors or in the locker room.”


  Some current players have talked amongst themselves about whether there are cameras in the locker room, but they didn’t believe that the organization actually would go to that extreme.


  However, there’s a growing trust gap between players and the current regime.


  Several players publicly criticized the organization in the past year for different reasons as general manager Joe Douglas insisted that “the plan is to create the best culture in sports.”


  Wide receiver Quincy Enunwa unloaded on the club for publicly shaming him for being fined after taking his wife, who is a veteran, out to lunch on Veteran’s Day rather than rehabbing his season-ending neck injury.


  “I don’t feel bad about it,” Enunwa said shortly after publicly relaying his displeasure at how the team handled the matter. “Sometimes you have to do things outside your comfort zone to create change.”


  Offensive lineman Kelechi Osemele criticized the organization and filed a grievance after decision makers refused to pay for a surgery that he ultimately had on his own. All-Pro safety Jamal Adams made it clear this summer that he didn’t trust or believe in coach Adam Gase.


  “One of the things I can tell you is that communication is going to be a big thing that we improve on in the offseason,” Douglas said 10 months ago. “That’s going to be on me. That’s going to be on everybody. That’s going to be a big thing moving forward for the entire organization.”

Willhoite and his wife, Karen, moved to Gorham three years ago, following his 2016 retirement as a senior corporal in the Dallas Police Department, where he was a 29-year career employee.
 A Texas native who was born in Houston, Willhoite has worked for two summers as a seasonal U.S. Forest Service forest technician on the White Mountain National Forest.
 Hired this month at an annual salary of $63,0000, he will be out on the road in uniform as soon as he successfully passes a single state test that’s designed to ensure that he knows the relevant laws and codes.
 The Gorham Police Department now has six full-time officers.
 The select board voted unanimously to recommend to the state Department of Revenue Administration that its new tax rate be set at $31.62 per $1,000. That figure was reached by shaving a $1 off the rate by tapping the town’s Unassigned Fund Balance.
 Approximately 11 percent of the town’s annual expenditures will still remain on hand. DRA recommends that municipalities aim to keep between 10 and 12 percent on hand.
 The select board and Fire Chief Phil Cloutier discussed at length the emergency mask ordinance that the chief had proposed be adopted for 90 days in light of "active spread and transmission of COVID-19 within the town" in order to "protect the town’s most vulnerable citizens, and promote an environment in which students are able to attend in-person classes and businesses are able to conduct and sustain their day-to-day operations."
 Board members agreed with the wording of the chief’s proposal except did not agree with adopting a fine schedule that the police would enforce.
 Police Chief Marsh joined the conversation. Both chiefs agreed that when someone who had no medical reason not to wear a mask consistently refused to do so, it was important to issue tickets that included a fine schedule.

“The job is certainly something I consider my dream job as now my career and my passion for racing have become one,” Mike said.
 The next rung of Mike’s career ladder climb came just recently, in late summer of 2020, when he was promoted to the AMA director of racing. The position entails overseeing all domestic amateur and professional competitors in the United States, plus continuing to oversee the Supercross Series. For Mike to have these two jobs is as he shared, “Is something that I am not only excited about but very humbled by, all at the same time.”
 But it doesn’t stop there — recently Mike was elected as a member of the Motocross Commission at the Federation of International de Motocyclism (FIM), which is the governing/sanctioning body of motorcycle racing globally. One of his responsibilities there is to provide guidance to the future of the sport on a worldwide level — quite an extensive, widely varied job requiring accountability and management skills among other gifts.
 The most favorite part of Mike’s job is “heading up the U.S. Motocross Team effort each year. The three-rider team represents the U.S. on the world stage at one race per year at a designated location around the world. I grew up cheering the team on and now to be the leader of the team means a lot to me.”
 Fitting in very nicely with this being the day after Veteran’s Day, Mike shared that he is regularly able to represent and promote military members, veterans and the United States as a whole in his various roles in the sport and for that, he is very honored. Mike is very patriotic, loves his country and has numerous family members and friends who have served or currently serving our country in the military.
 “I am so grateful for the continued support of my family and friends back home and am fortunate to be able to travel to great locations throughout the world to promote the sport of motocross,” Mike said. “I first threw a leg over a motorcycle in Berlin and no matter where I am in the world, Berlin will always be home to me!”
 Thanks, Mike, well-spoken. Thanks for sharing part of your story with us!
 As I expected there were a few names I totally spaced out on regarding the Veteran's Day list from the Enman/Holt family published in Tuesday's edition of The Sun. Even with these additions, I am sure I may still be missing some. Four or five misses out of 80 names aren't too bad but I would prefer 100 percent accuracy.
 So I am adding Larry Dion, Kierra Laflamme, Nathan Jewett, Leo Frizzell Jr., Emmons, Harry and Paul Holt and Charles Wentworth. Of special note too, my great, great uncle Thomas Hawkins was killed in the battle of Cedar Creek during the Civil War, Mark Wentworth, KIA in Korea, and Maurice Holt and Carroll Woodward were wounded in combat during WWII. Last, but not least, Don Enman — even though he did not serve in the military, he was drafted, went to Manchester where he passed the Army physical and was set to go to boot camp.
 While awaiting further orders he was called into an office and was informed that he would be sent home since he was considered an essential worker (dairy farmer). He shared with me just the other day that on the one hand he was relieved with that news, as he wasn't sure what would happen to the family farm with him gone, but felt an obligation to serve his country in the Army. Another interesting fact was that his neighbor, friend and fellow farmer, Arthur "Bud" Cleary was with him that day in Manchester and he too was sent home to tend to the family dairy farm.
 My cousin and a military vet already listed, Ronald Hawkins, married Beverly Hamlin, and her brother Elmer Hamlin, fought in Korea, and was listed as Missing in Action.
 Over the last 8 months, I have missed the special ceremonies and people who gathered for Memorial Day, Independence Day and Veterans Day in Milan and Dummer.

You should avoid using green wood since it creates more creosote that can be unsightly on the fireplace and the walls surrounding it. You also need to be careful and avoid burning moldy, wet, rotten, or diseased wood that can produce harmful gasses. As a rule of thumb, you must avoid burning anything that is not firewood in your fireplace. Some of the items that you must avoid in your firebox include furniture, boxes, magazines, trash, or a Christmas tree which is greenwood. The problem of burning items that are not wood, or at least the proper kind, is that they can release chemical fumes that are also sticky.

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — German industrial equipment and technology maker Siemens AG recorded a 28% increase in net profit to 1.88 billion euros ($2.21 billion) in the most recent quarter, boosted by a gain of 800 million euros from discontinued operations, the Munich-based company said Thursday. It gave an upbeat outlook for 2021, saying the pandemic “will not have a long-lasting effect” on the global economy.


  The gain compared with profit of 1.47 billion euros in the July-September quarter last year.


  It was the last set of earnings at the 173-year-old company under CEO Joe Kaeser, who is turning over the top post in February to current deputy Roland Busch. Since taking over in 2013, Kaeser has led a restructuring that included spinoffs of stakes in the energy and medical equipment businesses


  “The Siemens team delivered a strong finish to a remarkable year,” Kaeser said in a statement.


  The company said it foresaw “a moderate increase” in net profit for the group in its 2021 fiscal year.


  The quarterly profit rounded off the company’s full fiscal year, which saw an annual profit of 4.2 billion euros even as the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the global economy. The annual figure declined from 5.7 billion euros in the previous fiscal year; the fiscal 2020 figure was held back by a loss of 100 million euros from discontinued operations compared with a gain of 500 million from such operations in 2019.


  Siemens shareholders in July approved the spinoff of a majority stake in its energy business, which includes gas turbines and wind power.


  Kaeser has called the move a way to reduce risk and support the company's share price. Siemens' other products include railroad equipment and factory automation.

Here's what to look for in the Atlantic Coast Conference in week 10:
 GAME OF THE WEEK
 No. 2 Notre Dame (7-0, 6-0 Atlantic Coast Conference) at Boston College (5-3, 4-3). The Fighting Irish are coming off a huge, double-overtime, 47-40 home victory over then-No. 1 Clemson that put them alone in first place in the ACC and kept alive their hopes of appearing in the College Football Playoff. The teams last played in the Boston metro area in 2015, when the No. 4 Fighting Irish held off BC for a 19-16 win at Fenway Park. Notre Dame leads series 16-9 after last year's 40-7 win. Brian Kelly is 6-0 against Boston College as Notre Dame's coach and is seeking his 100th career victory at the school. He'll be facing one of his former quarterbacks, Phil Jurkovec. The sophomore transfer completed 12 of 24 passes for 204 yards and two touchdowns in a six-point loss at Clemson two weeks ago, leads the ACC with 2,083 passing yards, and is an adept scrambler who can throw effectively on the run. He was stuck behind Ian Book at Notre Dame and has thrived under first-year Boston College coach Jeff Hafley.
 BEST MATCHUP
 Boston College QB Phil Jurkovec against the Notre Dame defense. Jurkovec is 172-for-277 passing with 15 touchdowns and four interceptions and ranks sixth in the ACC in total offense at 272.4 yards per game. The Irish defense is allowing 296.6 yards per game, virtually tied with Pittsburgh for the top spot in the conference, and a league-best 14.6 points per game, and opponents are averaging just 15.9 first downs. The Irish also rank first on third down, holding opponents to a 24.7% conversion rate, and third in pass defense (211.4).

Just how did Nitish Kumar pull it off? Likely to be sworn-in for a record fifth term as Chief Minister of the politically important state of Bihar unless he declines the post or in the unlikely event the BJP wants it for itself, he is that rare species ~ a relatively clean politician ~ in India today. So, first up, and to that extent, the electorate can congratulate itself for overlooking many grievances and voting back to power the NDA alliance he heads in the state.

My son Luke Enman and Mike Pelletier went to school and worked together for a time, and recently Luke shared about Mike’s career in motocross racing, which automatically caught my attention. I communicated with Mike and developed this story along with pictures for the reading audience. Here is the result of my connection and modified interview with him.
 Mike Pelletier was born in Rhode Island but was raised and grew up in Berlin, graduating from Berlin High School in 2005 and Plymouth State University in 2009, with a bachelor’s degree in business administration and a minor in professional communication. During his formative years in Berlin, Mike’s parents, Gail and Pepsi Pelletier, were always very involved and supportive of him and his ventures.
 Mike took part in a variety of activities, school and sports related, but his passion in particular early on was ice hockey — he loved the sport, and still does. He played youth hockey from mites to midgets along with Berlin High hockey during the winter and played in many summer league programs. As a matter of fact, he still follows his beloved Mountaineers’ hockey team as well as the other school sports.

You should always make it a policy that you do not leave a fire burning unattended to avoid the risk of any hazards. You must have your fire extinguisher ready so that you can douse the flames should anything happen. All the same, you need to keep the area around the fireplace clear of debris, paper, and other items that can catch fire easily. While it is tempting to place some decorations close to the fireplace, it is vital to maintain a safe distance. This helps to minimize the chances of unintended consequences such as fire outbreaks.
