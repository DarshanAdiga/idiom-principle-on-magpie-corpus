“With my apology I hope moving forward we can work together professionally,” she said. “The reality is I'm not going anywhere. I will continue to fight for what is right and I will continue to not involve myself in any unprofessional behavior if it does continue. I apologize to our citizens of this town and you will see a better side to Tracey Knight-Simane.”


  She said she has felt ostracized, unwelcome, ignored, belittled and disrespected, and there has been false information circulated concerning her reason for seeking the office.


  “The members of this council, without naming names, I feel are trying to push me out,” Knight-Simane said. “This is not high school. We should not be acting like children. We are grown adults, all working for our citizens.


  “Regardless of our votes, our positions, our personal feelings towards one another during council meetings, our citizens should see professionalism and us working together for the good.”


  Last week's session grew contentious as council discussed a list of alleged water leaks posted on Facebook by David Dan, the other new council member. That, however, wasn't the first time Dan's questions and positions had ruffled feathers since he took office.


  Other issues, such as Dan's inquiries about policies and procedures, have led to tense and protracted discussions over the months. A planned tour of town facilities in August was canceled just prior to its start when council members failed to agree on an order for the tour.


  Dan followed up Knight-Simane's comments Tuesday by saying the past five months have been disheartening.


  “It's very unfortunate,” Dan said. “This is not the way a public body should behave.


  “In America we're a democracy. The elections determine the directions that governments take. It's not the career employees that set the direction. It's the elected officials, so I'm just asking you guys to give us a little bit of grace. Give us a little bit of breathing room. Allow us to ask questions. Give us information we have requested. I don't think that's too much to ask.”


  “We can agree to disagree on certain things, but we will all certainly work as hard as we can to do what's best for the community," Councilman Donnie Souders said. "I think we all can do a little bit better of having the same persona and personality when we're not in the public and we're doing things behind the scenes as we do when we're sitting in front of you, in front of the camera. If we can do that, I think we'll get to where we should be going.”

Lonamae (Jones) Clough was born to Archie Franklin Jones and Arbie Mae (Walters) Jones near Eufaula, Ok in 1940. Lonamae moved with her family to the rich farmland of Arvin, CA in 1949 to seek a better life with more opportunities. Lonamae then met the love of her life, Troy Clough, in 1955 and drove across state lines to get married in Quartzsite, AZ, where it was legal to marry at the age of 15. Lonamae and Troy briefly lived in Arizona and Idaho before settling in on 10th Street in Chino, Ca in 1964 where they lived for 35 years. In Chino, she worked on the packaging line at Westlam Foods, retiring in 1999 after 25 years of service. Lonamae and Troy then moved to Clovis, NM to be closer to immediate family, where she resided until her passing.   Lonamae, also affectionately known as Granny, Dude or Aunt Dude, loved spending time with her family, her extended family, and friends of her extended family, which in turn became new members of her family. Granny was at her happiest when her house was full of people. She always made sure you would get something to eat, whether it was a plate of Okie enchiladas, a bowl of beans and cornbread, a sweet treat or savory piece of jerky from the Granny pantry. At her home in both Chino and Clovis, she was always the gracious host and always joking around. She would recruit anybody who walked through her door to play a game of marbles or a game of cards. She enjoyed many different card games, a few of her favorites were Spades, 31, King's Corners, Up the River/Down the River, Nil, Dollar Game, Hand and Foot, Hearts and Solitary. Lonamae was an avid sports fan and never missed watching an Angels baseball game, complete with her Angels gear and rally cap or rally monkey. She was also the biggest fan and supporter of her kids, grandkids and great grandkids, not only in sports but also in life. She will be dearly missed by all.   Lonamae was preceded in death by her son, Perry Lee Clough; daughter in law, Deborah Clough; brothers, AJ Jones, Curtis Jones, Odell Jones and Loyce (Sonny) Jones; sisters, Juanita Jones, Georgette (Getta) Hardison and Gloyce (Sis) Morris.   She is survived by her husband of 65 years, Troy Clough; daughter, Donna (Stan) Surina of Clovis NM; and son, Mearl Clough of Van Buren, AR. She is also survived by her grandchildren, Matt (Lacee) Surina of Austin, TX, Shanna Smith of Alma, AR, Katie (Steven) Farmer of Albuquerque, NM, Susan (Andrew) Michael of Dallas, TX, Julie (Cody) Harmon of Lubbock, TX, Joseph Surina of Clovis, NM, Jacy (Chris) Brooks of Van Buren, AR, Troy (Kayla) Clough of Van Buren, AR; great grandchildren, Lane Miller, Madison Harmon, Zachary Birchfield, Harmonie Birchfield, Michael Sandoval, Jacqueline Michael, Denton Clough, Ellen Surina, Antonio Farmer, Carter Michael, Claire Surina, Christopher Farmer, Wyatt Clough, Lily Surina, Memphis Brooks, Waylon Clough, Maxton Harmon, Peyton Harmon, Taylin Harmon, Surina Farmer; and many nieces and nephews who loved their Aunt Dude dearly.   A memorial service to celebrate the life and legacy of Lonamae will be held at a later date.      Arrangements have been entrusted to Muffley Funeral Home 575-762-4435, www.muffleyfuneralhome.com

By Owen Gleiberman


  LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - When you watch a biographical movie about an artist, the drama of creativity -- the writing of "In Cold Blood," the invention of funk -- tends to be front and center.


  But in "Mank," David Fincher's raptly intricate and enticing movie about Herman J. Mankiewicz, the fabled screenwriter of '30s and '40s Hollywood, and how he wrote the script for "Citizen Kane," the act of creation is just one of many things that flow by. That's part of what gives the movie its uniquely atmospheric, at times tumultuous tone of you-are-there authenticity. , and the effect is to lend it a dizzying time-machine splendor.


  In the opening sequence, 1930s cars tool along a California country roadway, kicking up dust in a way that's captured with supreme luster by Eric Messerschmidt's exquisitely retro deep-focus black-and-white cinematography.


  The cars arrive at North Verde Ranch in Victorville, about 90 miles from Los Angeles, where Mankiewicz (Gary Oldman), who's nursing a broken leg, and who is a weary, bedraggled, washed-up drunk who nevertheless speaks in a more wryly amused manner than anyone in Hollywood, will spend the next 12 weeks lying in bed in a cozy getaway cottage, under the supervision of John Houseman (Sam Troughton), churning out the script that will become "Citizen Kane," the greatest movie ever made (or, at least, some think so -- I'm one).


  Mankiewicz, known to all as Mank, is a former New York journalist and critic who held court at the Algonquin Round Table, and the way Oldman plays him, with a delectably crumpled egomania, his wit has a wonderful droll compulsiveness about it.


  When he's drunk, the booze is like truth serum -- a way of keeping himself comfortably numb, and also honest. But even when he's just hungover (he's usually at least that), he's a human ticker-tape machine who speaks in outrageously orotund sentences -- the more inebriated the more complete, since he's compelled to follow his train of thought to the bitter end. Nothing interrupts the acerbic monolog in his head.


  Listening to a corrupt studio chief make a fraudulently "sincere" speech about salary cuts to his employees, Mank remarks, "Not even the most disgraceful thing I've ever seen," the irony pulling the quip in two directions like taffy.


  "Why is it," asks Mankiewicz, "that when Houseman edits, everyone ends up speaking like a constipated Oxford don?" We could listen to Mank all day, because what he's reacting to is the castle-in-the-air unreality of the world around him, where actors are gods onscreen and indentured servants off, where writers like himself get paid $1,500 a week to sit around and drink, gamble, and toss off cardboard scripts (or maybe even, on occasion, a good one), and where the secret engine of the Dream Factory is power.


  Mank is at North Verde Ranch because Orson Welles (Tom Burke), the 24-year- old boy-wonder director of "Citizen Kane," brought in by RKO Pictures and given carte blanche to make any film he wants, has arranged for him to be there.


  Welles has personally sought out the brilliant but damaged Mank; he wants the first draft of a screenplay in 90 days. So Mank sets to work, scrawling out the words himself or dictating them to Rita Alexander (Lily Collins), the pert British stenographer and hand-holder who's been assigned to him. For a while, the movie uses script cues as titles, like "EXT. PARAMOUNT STUDIOS -- DAY -- 1930 (FLASHBACK)," a device that indicates that "Mank" is going to hop around its main character as playfully as "Citizen Kane" did. It will tell his story by telling the story that surrounds him.


  We leap back to 1930, when Mank, at the estate of William Randolph Hearst, sees a Western being shot and forms a fast friendship with Marion Davies (Amanda Seyfried), the sweetly brittle starlet who's filming a scene where she's being burned at the stake. Mank uses his gift of gab to open doors, and when he chats with Hearst (Charles Dance), the newspaper tycoon who is Marion's sugar daddy, and who is such a wealthy force that he's helping to bankroll MGM, he earns himself a seat at the dinner table next to the old man.


  There are scenes in the writers room at Paramount, where Mank and future legends like Ben Hecht (Jeff Harms), S.J. Perelman (Jack Romano), and Mank's handsome brother Joe (Tom Pelphrey) spend all day entertaining each other, until they're called into a meeting with David O. Selznick (Toby Leonard Moore), an owlish tough nut they know how to bamboozle.


  As the film moves into the '30s, and finds Mank hobnobbing with folks like the MGM mogul Louis B. Mayer (played with a magnetic blunt-witted scowl by Arliss Howard) and his youthful right-hand smoothie, Irving Thalberg (Ferdinand Kingsley), it takes up themes that have an eerie parallel with today: the do-or-die struggle of movie studios to win people back to theaters during the Depression; the 1934 Democratic gubernatorial campaign of Upton Sinclair, the man-of-the-people writer who's presented as a sort of Bernie Sanders of his day.


  Mank and his fellow scribes are ardent backers of Sinclair, but the Hollywood powers view him as a socialist they'll do anything to shut down. The battle turns dark when Mank, with one flippant remark, inadvertently gives the studio the idea to create fake-news newsreels that wind up torpedoing Sinclair's campaign.


  In "Mank," even the darkness has a high sheen, as in a masterful drawing-room cocktail scene at the Hearst Castle in San Simeon that carries a luscious gossipy voyeuristic intrigue. The performances are sharp, witty, and lived-in, and several of the actors have an indelible resonance -- notably Amanda Seyfried, who plays Marion with the Brooklyn kewpie-doll sparkle of a woman who likes herself but knows just how the game is played (the difference between Marion and the "Kane" character Mankiewicz based on her, the talentless and despondent Susan Alexander, is so marked it's the essence of creative license with a tinge of personal betrayal), and Charles Dance, who endows Hearst with a hauntingly sinister humanity.


  As the film goes on, we start to see how everything in it feeds into "Citizen Kane" -- not just Mankiewicz's access to Hearst and Marion, but the politics of the Hollywood image factory, the theme of idealism vs. power, and Mank's own alcoholic cynicism, which culminates in a dinner party in which he drunkenly self-destructs while tossing off what is, in essence, the pitch for "Citizen Kane." (In his sozzled hallucination, it's the life story of Hearst meets "Don Quixote.") Mank has hollowed himself out, yet in a weird way he has to reach the point where he has nothing to lose in order to write a script that's bold enough to undercut the fantasy machinery of Hollywood.


  Written by Jack Fincher, who is David Fincher's (late) father, "Mank" is a lusciously evocative, verbally sharp-angled movie that's never less than engrossing. Yet given that it's about the creation of "Citizen Kane," there's a way that it's almost more inside baseball than it needed to be. And that could limit its appeal. Why does a movie that devotes 20 minutes to Upton Sinclair not include a single scene in which we get to see Mank and Welles brainstorming the idea for "Citizen Kane"? Whose decision was it to make a movie about Hearst in the first place? Who thought up the visionary "News on the March" fake documentary?


  From "Mank," you'd think the answers were "Mank, Mank, and Mank." (You'd also think that Welles objected, in an over-my-dead-body way, to the idea of Mankiewicz receiving screen credit.)


  The film buys more or less completely into the notion proffered by Pauline Kael's exuberant but problematic 1971 essay "Raising Kane" -- that "Kane," in concept and writing, was all Mankiewicz, and Welles provided the fancy-camera- angle showmanship. But sorry, that was always an extremely overstated mythology. And it's a nagging flaw in a movie that immerses us in the Dream Factory but never fully nails how the dream of "Kane" came to be.

Acker, in McNulty's view, was "a good Samaritan who had police brutality unleashed on him. And this wasn't an accident. Remember the Denver Police officer who posted a picture on Instagram of himself in riot gear that said, 'Let's start a riot'? That was the attitude the DPD brought to these protests. They went into the streets trying to start a police riot. They were the instigators before any kind of violence or damage happened in the City of Denver during these protests."


  Thus far, no video of Acker getting shot has surfaced; McNulty accuses "the city of stonewalling me and not providing me any documentation of videos, because they say it's still under investigation. This is the standard cover-up by the Denver Police Department. They say everything's under investigation for years on end, and at the end of the investigation, they clear all the officers and sweep everything under the rug."


  To McNulty, the lawsuit is both an attempt to get justice for Acker and evidence that "we need to massively cut back on the militarization of police. The nights when there was no destruction and no violence during the protests over the summer were the nights when there were no police officers on the streets in riot gear confronting people. If there's ever been a better argument for getting rid of police militarization, I don't know what it is."

Aerosmith's comeback really took off with the 1989 album "Pump," with many of its tunes first worked out in the lengthy sessions the band had at Rik Tinory's Cohasset studio. That album became one of 1990's best-selling albums, and then a couple of tunes on the "Wayne's World 2" soundtrack kept the band's profile rising. This was about the time I began covering the band, as one of the three music writers the Patriot Ledger had at the time.


  Aerosmith's star began to really rise as the '90s unfolded, even as their management brought in some outside writers to help them with lyrics. 1993's "Get A Grip" continued their revival, and their burgeoning profile especially around Boston, led to their founding their own club, Mama Kin in 1994. "This club is about giving back to the music,'' Tyler told reporters during a press conference at the opening. "The club scene is so bad, it's like a pothole on the road to getting there. We're trying to help that. I hated playing clubs, but that's where you really develop as a band.'' Mama Kin closed about 1997.

Roseville, Calif. (KOVR) - Authorities in California are searching for a machete-wielding man who threatened to attack a store clerk.Surveillance video shows a man at a neighborhood convenience store get aggressive before reaching into his pants and pulling out a machete.Things get really scary as he starts bashing the plexiglass shield as the clerk dashes to get to a phone and call police.“Attacks like this, especially in convenience stores, are very uncommon,” said Rob Baquera, with the Roseville Police Department.Police say the suspect is John Bontemps and he’s wanted for questioning about this crime and others.Officers say he stole from the store and broke into a car in the parking lot just moments after the violent attack.“We definitely believe this individual is armed and dangerous,” Baquera said.Katie Stackhouse couldn’t believe how well the clerk kept his cool in the face of a deadly weapon. She works at the aquarium shop next door and is a frequent customer at the convenience store.“Oh my gosh, I would not have stayed as calm as he did,” Stackhouse said.She’s sad to see this happen to her work neighbors but thankful a simple defense against coronavirus did so much more“He could have easily come over the counter if that wasn’t there, so I’m glad there was the extra bit of protection,” she said.Stackhouse says the shopping area doesn’t usually see this kind of violence.Copyright 2020 KOVR via CNN Newsource.

Bird said she spent a lot of time thinking about her future off the court over the past year. She got engaged to longtime girlfriend Megan Rapinoe last month and last year, while recovering from knee surgery, froze her eggs to eventually have a family.
 The WNBA’s all-time assist leader and her Storm teammate Breanna Stewart became more comfortable with the decision after attending an informational meeting together last year at Seattle Reproductive Medicine, a fertility clinic. Stewart, 26, froze her eggs during the summer of 2019; Bird froze hers a few months later.
 According to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, egg freezing typically works best for those in their 20s to early 30s, and is not usually recommended for women over 38 years. Egg quality deteriorates as women age and pregnancy rates are lower for women who freeze their eggs in their late 30 or early 40s.
 Bird only had 10 eggs frozen while Stewart had around 40.

The next step in Tallman's process was to print out all the lyrics to "Julius" -- even though she already knew them all by heart -- and study up on the song's history by visiting some of the many online Phish forums.


  "The song 'Julius' is loosely based on the story of Julius Caesar. But the other aspect of it is, whenever I think of Julius, I think of Orange Julius. I wanted to be able to tie that aspect in as well, so that's kind of where that inspiration started. I was just trying to find a way to marry what the lyrics were about and the more abstract connection I had made myself, and I'm sure I'm not the only person that's ever made that correlation in the Phish community."


  The short film starts with suited businessmen in a conference room, then transports the viewer to an orange-hued dream sequence that Tallman affectionately calls "the healthy Bacchus scene." As for the plot of the video, Tallman says, "I leaned into way more abstraction with this than actual narrative. But the story of Julius Caesar, or rather the moral of it, is that arrogance will get you in the end. I wanted to create a slightly different end to that. If arrogance doesn't get you, maybe you find a way to shift. I have Will [William Clayton], who is the star of the film, this quasi-Julius character, that has some arrogance to him, and in the end, he decides to be part of the fun. He saw the light; he saw the orange."

Yeah. Thanks Karri. Hi, Ryan. First off, we're obviously very pleased with where agent count is going and the investments we're making in our growth initiatives and engagement from our network continue to show signs of success. As far as specifically the question around the country, I would say our footprint is very large and there is not one particular area that we could point to, one or two, that we see it coming from. It's fairly consistent across the country. But usually what we see and what we continue to see, is the Midwest always doesn't fluctuate as much as the coastlines. And so all around the country, the coastlines usually have the highest amount of growth. They have the highest amount of contraction when markets change, and that has been consistent for us this year as well.

Legend has it that a gig at Max's Kansas City, the New York City music joint, was a turning point, even if the band had to pay for its slot on the night's bill. Clive Davis, the big honcho from Columbia Records heard the band and before long signed them to his label. Their eponymous debut album in 1973 never got higher than No. 166 on the album charts and even its standout single "Dream On" only cracked the singles charts as high as No. 59.


  It wasn't until Aerosmith's third album, 1975's "Toys in the Attic" that they really burst onto the national scene, as the single "Sweet Emotion" cracked the Top Forty, and ironically, a re-issue of "Dream On" peaked at No. 6. But even as the band was crafting a dozen singles that would have a big impact on the charts, the off-stage antics and substance abuse problems were stressing the band. All that relentless touring took a toll, and between 1979 and 1981, both Perry and Whitford left the band. It wasn't until 1984 that the original five was back together, but the "Rock in a Hard Place" album didn't yield any hits and the band was in kind of a slump until collaborating with Run-DMC on a reworked "Walk This Way" vaulted to the No. 4 spot on the charts in 1986 - higher than Aerosmith's original version.

When it comes to Aerosmith, the hard-rocking Grammy-winning quintet that played its first gig at Nipmuc Regional High, I'm a late bloomer. But like the saying goes, better late than never.


  Aerosmith made their live debut 50 years ago today - Nov. 6, 1970 - at the former high school in Mendon that's now Miscoe Middle School. Five wild decades later, Steven Tyler, Joe Perry, Tom Hamilton, Joey Kramer and Brad Whitford, are still rocking. The band's 50th anniversary concert at Fenway Park was pushed to Sept. 14, 2021, after coronavirus concerns forced the postponement of what was being billed as a "once-in-a-lifetime one-night only performance."

  When the band was at their initial height, busting up the charts throughout the late 1970s, I was surely a music fan, but gravitating to more singer- songwriter rockers like Moon Martin, Nils Lofgren, Jerry Jeff Walker and Greg Kihn. Over time I came to appreciate their hard-rocking take on things and the consistent professionalism and musical precision they brought to every show or album. It's a style of rock rooted in the blues, of course, like the Rolling Stones and other bands, but it's a more polished, decidedly American version. And the unique dynamics of the quintet makes for natural dramatic tension that lends an almost operatic quality to some of their biggest hits, like "Dream On."

  As of right now, it's hard to say how much of an advantage the Xbox Series X will have with a faster CPU and more compute units, or if the faster GPU clock speeds on the PS5 will give it an advantage in some games. But the games we have played on both systems have run the best they ever have.


  Both systems also have SSDs. Sony's drive feels blazingly fast, but it's 825GB, with only 667.2GB free out of the box. The Xbox Series X has a 1TB SSD that ends up with 802GB usable.

1997 was a weird year for Aerosmith, as their "Nine Lives" tour was interrupted by a Tyler leg injury, and then famed car aficionado Kramer had one of his babies, a Ferrari, catch fire at a Marshfield gas station. Some years later, I did an interview with Kramer when he was expanding his gourmet coffee brand, and I was instructed by the publicist I could ONLY ask about cars or coffee, no music. Another time, publicizing his own superb autobiography, Kramer was more than willing to talk about the band and his role in it.


  1998 brought one of the band's biggest hits - the ballad "I Don't Want To Miss A Thing," from the soundtrack to the film "Armageddon." Penned by pop songwriter Diane Warren, the tune is a neat vehicle for Tyler's softer side and it has become a concert staple, even if it is miles away stylistically from Aerosmith's signature sound.

A presidential election is in itself a highly watched election with high participation. However, due to the tremulous tenure of Donald Trump in the White House voter turnout was expected to be in unprecedented numbers and estimates still didn’t capture what the numbers actually were. With Harris County being the second largest with residents Hollins knew he had a monumental task before him. Far greater than only past hiccups was the fact that we are in the middle of a global pandemic, which has gripped the country in fear with rising death tolls and highly contagious nature.


  Since voters were fearful of coming to polling locations and the increase in voter turnout could lead to long lines and wait times it would be best to remove that obstacle. Hollins’ solution was to send the more than two million eligible Harris County voters a mail-in ballot application whether they requested it on not. Easier said than done since the state of Texas fought against the saying Hollins was acting outside his legal authority and the action would cause confusion among voters. Hollins, an attorney himself, countered their argument saying instructions were clear and absentee voting was a safe option for voters. Hollins won the lawsuit in lower tier courts only to lose his case in the state’s highest civil court.


  The state of Texas sued in August to block Hollins from mailing out the applications, arguing that doing so exceeded his legal authority and would cause confusion among voters, some of whom are not eligible for absentee ballots under Texas’ unusually strict criteria. But Hollins argued that the planned mailers gave clear guidance on eligibility and that encouraging absentee ballots where appropriate was integral to holding a safe election during the pandemic. Lower courts with Democratic judges took Harris County’s side, ruling that Hollins could send applications to voters who would otherwise have to request them or find them online. Applications were only sent to voters 65 years-old and up, who qualified for absentee ballots. Hollins called the ruling disappointing in that the court sided with “political forces” to limit voter accessibility. Following this case came numerous others as Republicans used their collective energy to fight all efforts to expand voter access claiming it left opportunities for fraud and other problems.


  Despite the hurdles, Hollins was able to expand voter options for Harris County to ensure the safety and convenience of the election. Polling locations were available in each area of town with tons of photo booths. He tripled the number of locations in comparison to previous years. He piloted drive-thru polling locations and 24-hour polling locations. He ensured polling locations were equipped with cleaning supplies, PPEs, and everything needed by poll workers, voters, and volunteers. He instituted new safety protocols in line with CDC guidelines. The attention to safety allowed voters to feel protected when casting their vote resulting in record-breaking numbers at the polls.


  The first day of early voting saw over 125,000 voters. Over one million voters were chronicled for the first week of early voting. Altogether more than 2 million voted during early voting. Some voters whizzed through polling locations while others had to pack their patience and wait for hours. Voters were just as determined to cast their vote, as Hollins was to keep them safe.

 # AP calls Eighth District race for Cartwright
 Kathryne Rubright
 Pocono Record
 The Associated Press called Pennsylvania’s Eighth District race for U.S. Rep. Matt Cartwright shortly after noon on Friday.
 The Democrat will return to Congress for a fifth term, having defeated Republican Jim Bognet, a former Trump administration appointee at the Export- Import Bank.
 Without provisional ballots tallied, Cartwright leads by about 11,800 votes, or about 52% to 48%.
 In a statement released after the race was called, Cartwright thanked his volunteers and supporters, and recommitted to working for all of his constituents.
 “Eight years ago I ran for Congress for the first time, and made a promise that I would be a Representative who worked for all Northeastern Pennsylvanians. And today, I am full of pride and gratitude that I can continue working for this great region," he said.
 “This win, however, is not about me. It’s about Northeastern Pennsylvanians, and it’s because of our volunteers and supporters who mobilized voters across the region amid a tumultuous election cycle. Voters have made me optimistic for the future we have ahead. Together, we will create an inclusive economy, protect hard-earned benefits and affordable health care, and modernize our aging infrastructure.
 “I applaud Mr. Bognet for putting his name on the ballot, but ultimately our vision to Move Northeastern Pennsylvania forward won. Regardless of who you voted for, the commitment I made eight years ago still rings true today — I will work for every Northeastern Pennsylvanian.”
 As of Friday afternoon, Bognet's most recent statement was from before the race was called.
 "In NEPA, we are fighters, and we won’t stop fighting for our community and our supporters,” he said Thursday afternoon. “There are thousands of ballots yet to be counted, and the lead in the election has swung back and forth multiple times since the polls closed two days ago. We demand that all lawful votes be counted, and that unlawful ballots not be counted. Our campaign will continue until that occurs and we will work for a just and fair count."

We showed we can deliver incredible growth. In fact, the highest subscriber growth in our history while simultaneously beating expectations on service revenue, EBITDA, and EPS and increasing guidance across the board, including free cash flow. Simultaneous growth and profitability, fueled by the rapid and faster than expected unlocking of synergies, a gift which we'll keep giving for years to come.

Yeah. So, I mean, I think you say it well, which is -- this is a multi- variable equation here and we're looking at. What resources we would need to bring to bear to launch the product versus what the value would be if bringing on a partner for in particular Europe. We've done the analysis in Europe and it's a fairly concentrated market in terms of physician targets, treatment patterns and so on, actually more concentrated than the U.S. That's offset to some degree by the need for national-level commercial infrastructure. So what you end up with are estimates of commercial and medical affairs, infrastructure, similar to what you have in the Europe, when you look at sort of region to region comparison but certainly within the ambit of a company like ImmunoGen, particularly being able to finance on the back of positive pivotal data. So, that said, there are a lot of advantages to partnering as well and so that's something that we will evaluate in particular with positive pivotal data in hand.

"Moonbase 8" is about three guys in what amounts to quarantine, which adds an unexpectedly timely wrinkle to what's otherwise a pretty silly comedy. Even with that, though, this wry but inconsequential Showtime series feels so weightless, despite the talent involved, that it could easily just float away.


  Hatched up by the team behind the sketch comedy "Portlandia," the mildly amusing conceit involves a trio of aspiring, mostly inept astronauts auditioning for a spot on a Moon base by sequestering themselves in a mock space installation in Winslow, Arizona. (As a footnote, this is almost surely the most pop-culture attention Winslow has received since the Eagles song "Take It Easy.")


  The astronauts are played by John C. Reilly, Fred Armisen and Tim Heidecker (of "Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!"), and they're an eccentric bunch, down the quirky nicknames. Reilly's Cap is clearly the most desperate of the trio thanks to troubles at home, while Heidecker's Rook is a devout Christian struggling with being separated from his wife and horde of children.


  Despite the notion that the base seeks to approximate the challenges of being on the Moon -- dusting off the "urine recycling machine," for example, when there's a problem with the water supply -- various people drop in and out over the course of the six episodes. That said, the series remains fairly claustrophobic, and mostly uneventful, despite the occasional foray outside their protective bubble into the desert environs (wearing spacesuits, of course).

Cate Flanagan thought about quitting soccer.


  Two years ago, in the Division 3 Central final against neighboring Blackstone Valley Tech, the Beavers scored a goal with six minutes left in regulation. That's when Flanagan, then a Nipmuc Regional High School freshman, set out to score the tying goal.


  "As a freshman I had a lot of people backing me up. A lot of the upperclassmen told me, 'Go do it, let's get a goal,' " recalled Flanagan, now a 17-year-old Nipmuc junior. "They passed me the ball and I saw the goalie off the line. It was kind of a flash. I remember taking a shot and the next thing I knew I was on my butt."


  When Flanagan kicked the ball and had her leg in the air, two BVT defenders ran into it from each side.


  "I have PTSD on that one. I might cry a little bit," said Cate's mother, Cristine. "She just screamed. She went down and the scream was horrible."


  One of the other Flanagans in attendance was Cate's older brother, Collin. The 2018 Nipmuc alum and former Warriors soccer captain had returned from college to watch his little sister play. After seeing her go down and getting the okay from Nipmuc athletic director Christopher Schmidt, he jumped the fence and sprinted onto the field to Cate.


  "She's as tough as nails, so when she goes down and stays down, something's wrong," said Collin. "It was scary."


  While Collin was the one running to Cate on that November night, it was always the other way around growing up.


  "I just remember I always tried to keep up with him. We'd wake up early and race before he got on the bus up and down the driveway and I'd always lose," Cate said while laughing. "I just remember getting my first jersey that turned inside out and I was so excited that I finally had my own number because I used to wear his old jerseys around the house. I always wanted to be like him."


  That meant playing soccer at Nipmuc like her brother.


  As Collin was reaching the field, Nipmuc girls soccer coach Miguel Vidal and the team's trainer ran to Cate as she thought her kneecap came out. She yelled for it to be popped back in so she could go score a goal.


  Instead, it wasn't just her kneecap, and she never went back on the field that night. Her leg was reset later at the hospital after X-rays and a surplus of pain medications. The next morning, she received two screws into her femur as it had snapped on the play. The femur had been out of its socket and the outside of it separated from the inside and nearly tore through her skin.


  Thankfully, a certain man helped Flanagan avoid catastrophe.


  "I remember sitting in my hospital bed and the surgeon came in with his jacket on and a coffee in his hand, leaned up against the door and he goes, 'Alright, ready to get fixed?'" Cate said.


  "He showed up and he looked like a presence in the doorway," Cristine said. "It was kind of amazing."


  After a near week in a hospital bed, Cate left in a massive black boot that stretched from her ankle to upper thigh. She at times had to be taken around in a wheelchair and chose to not see people or visit friends.


  She also began to think twice about soccer.


  "She had just kind of given up," Cristine said.


  "I remember sitting at the countertop with my mom and it was right around that time that I could start doing things again and I remember looking at her and saying, 'I don't want to,' " said Cate as she started to cry. "I was terrified, not that it was going to happen again, but that I wasn't going to be who I was."


  But nearly two years into her recovery, Cate threw on a pair of little indoor cleats, got into her garage, and started banging a soccer ball off the wall to see if she had the same power in her leg as before.


  And she did.


  After overcoming her doubts and isolation, Cate got the screws in her leg removed this past July, setting her up for a return this season.


  It has come in a big way.


  The junior has 13 points through seven games as she and Nipmuc sit at 6-1 on the season. She is also already committed to play Division I soccer at Siena College in 2022.


  "She's wanted to play DI since she was in seventh grade," Collin said. "It's fantastic to see; it makes me really happy for her."


  In two years, Cate Flanagan went from being carted off the field into an ambulance, to nearly quitting soccer, to becoming a DI commit. Through it all, just like in a 1-0 win against Grafton on Wednesday, she's smiling and having fun.


  Said Cristine, "I'm so proud."

A 20 percent hike in the annual user fee that all Reno County residents pay to fund county landfill operations has been recommended for 2022 by Reno County's landfill manager and a consultant working for the department.


   


  If the County Commission agrees with the plan, it will push the annual fee that is currently $96 to $115.


   


  Solid Waste Director Megan Davidson said during a Reno County Commission study session on Wednesday that a revenue study also suggested the user fee continue to increase a small amount every year after that to keep up with inflation.


   


  The recommendations also include the county begin charging a separate $10 tipping fee for construction and demolition loads coming into the facility, which would generate an estimated $320,000 a year.


   


  The study by SCS Engineering recommends a continuing annual 1.75 percent increase in user fees after the initial hike, which for the first three years would equate to an additional $2 a year, and starting in 2026 it would go up $3.


   


  The combined changes will ensure the operation stays in the black while the county studies whether to go to an all user fee model and eliminate the annual assessment to taxpayers, said Vita Quinn, director of management services with SCS Engineers, who participated in the meeting by phone.


   


  Without the 20 percent fee hike, Davidson said, the operation will be $845,000 in the red by 2022 due to scheduled vehicle and equipment replacement and capital improvement costs, which are funded on a cash basis.


   


  The estimates do not include costs for the $9.5 million in improvements at the landfill scheduled to begin next year that will be funded through general obligation bonds.


   


  Open gates


   


  Under the annual fee system now used, which has been in place since the 1970s, Reno County residents are free to use the landfill as often as they like without additional charge.


   


  "Some come across two times a day, or five, or none at all," Davidson said.


   


  Commercial businesses pay a similar annual fee, but it's based on the size of trash containers used at their operations, which are audited annually, Davidson said, a monumental task.


   


  "Siemens Wind brings out 40-yard containers full of big pallets three to five times a day," Davidson said.


   


  The county also takes in municipal solid waste from McPherson, Rice, Kingman, and Stafford counties. Those counties are charged $32 per ton, which is charged as a gate fee when they come across the landfill scale. Those users generate about $950,000 a year.


   


  The county has hiked the annual landfill fee by 40 percent since 2016, from under $71 to $100 in 2021.


   


  In response to questions from the commissioners, Davidson said there is a danger in hiking fees too much on municipal out-of-county users and for demolition disposal, because users may go to other counties in the region that also operate landfills.


   


  While those counties' rates are higher, freight costs for transferring the trash also have to be considered.


   


  There's also concern that user fees will cause more illegal dumping in the county.


   


  "We're trying to find a good financial plan," Davidson. "It's (the landfill) expensive to maintain and operate, with equipment expenses, landfill gas systems, and post-closure costs. It's more than just a hole in the ground."


   


  Reno County is one of the few, if not the only, landfill in the state of Kansas that is not 100 percent user fee-based, Davidson noted. But discussions about replacing the annual fee with user fees have been rejected multiple times by commissions in the past.


   


  Part of the reason, Davidson said, was that the facility only had one scale, making it difficult to record weights of vehicles both going in and out. The landfill upgrade includes two sets of scales.


   


  Commission feedback


   


  After some discussion, Interim Commissioner Mark Steffen suggested a hybrid system, charging waste haulers a set amount for municipal waste based on annual tonnage, but commercial users and the public tipping fees for based on the actual weight brought in.


   


  "There's not a large staff at the landfill and a significant amount of effort goes into correctly billing," Davidson said.


   


  There's also the issue of policing those bringing in the waste, she said.


   


  "I'd like for you to recommend what's fairest and best and easier for what you need to do," Steffen concluded.


   


  "People don't like it on their taxes," said Commission Chairman Ron Sellers. "But if they're giving a fee on their taxes, they're more likely to bring refuse and trash to the landfill. I don't want to crap up the county with waste that's not brought in. Going from $96 to $115 we'll get a lot of flack, but my neighbor goes there three times a week and he'll still do that."


   


  "I like pay-as-you-go, pay-as-you-use," Commissioner Ron Hirst said. "But it's true those of us live west of town know what's dumped in the ditches."


   


  A tipping fee study, Quinn said, would look at what type of waste comes in, in what amounts, and what the cost to process it would be, as well as different scenarios what services to charge for and how much. It would also have to include the expected impact on different users and their likely response.


   


  Such a study, however, wouldn't occur until next year or even 2022, to be implemented in 2023. There was no discussion about such a study's cost.

 Earlier, Holder led SRH's bowling attack with impressive figures of three for 25 and was ably supported by T Natarajan (2/33) as RCB found the going difficult from the beginning.
 AB de Villiers' (56 off 43) scored a timely half-century to somewhat rescue RCB from a horrible start and take the team past the 120-run mark.
 RCB witnessed a horrendous start to their innings as they lost two wickets for 15 runs inside four overs after being sent into bat.
 Skipper Virat Kohli (6) , who opened the innings along side Devdutt Padikkal (1), was the first to depart, nicking one on the leg side to injured Wriddhiman Saha''s replacement Sreevats Goswami off Holder.
 An over later, Holder picked up his second victim when Padikkal pulled one to Priyam Garg inside the circle as RCB slumped to 15 for two.
 Aaron Finch (32 off 30), who replaced Josh Philippe, and de Villiers then tried to stabilise the innings with a 41-run third wicket stand.
 But twin blows in the 11th over put paid to RCB's effort.
 First, Finch departed, caught by Abdul Samad off Shahbaz Nadeem (1/30) and then a ball later, Moeen Ali was caught short off the crease by a direct hit from Rashid Khan.
 Shivam Dube (8) didn't help his side's cause, so was Washington Sundar (5).
 In between, De Villiers brought up his 50 off 39 balls with a boundary off Holder, but he was soon sent packing by a gem of an yorker from Natarajan as RCB lost their last hope.

Generally, though, the impact surfaces have on the games has been minimized compared to the earlier days of artificial turf that was almost like playing on cement. There’s always the infamous story of Bears receiver Wendell Davis, who tore the patellar tendons in both knees on the same play at Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia in 1993.
 “We have an independent field inspector who is not on a club or the NFL side and they do a report and a certification and review of all our surfaces,” explains Phil Bogle, the league’s director of game operations. “We inspect them every season, then do our reviews and there are numbers weekly entered by the field manager.
 “Throughout the season, you have climate as a big thing, depending on the surface and the use of the surface. Our field management requires mandatory practices for both natural and synthetic surfaces, and criteria all teams must meet on a weekly basis.”
 As the weeks proceed toward plummeting temperatures, snow, freezing rain and whipping wind, it’s critical that those field managers keep up. Even in such places as Arizona and Las Vegas, which use grass fields for indoor stadiums, diligence in keeping those surfaces up to standards is essential.

  El madrileño Bnet, líder invicto con 9 puntos, se medirá a Mnak, cuarto clasificado y el único capaz de seguir su ritmo de puntuación hasta la tercera jornada, cuando cayó ante Gazir, en una de las batallas más esperadas por el público más tradicional por la afinidad de ambos al rapeo, la musicalidad, la esencia callejera y la identificación más -hip-hopera' de la cultura.


  Por otro lado, Zasko Máster, que llega a la cita como cuarto clasificado, se mide a Blon, reciente subcampeón español de Red Bull, en uno de los grandes clásicos del formato y una de las rivalidades más potentes del circuito español.


  El 'Rey sin corona' tratará de mantener la dinámica de sus últimas actuaciones, en las que ha rendido a un nivel altísimo, pero no ha conseguido hacerse con los triunfos, y romper la sequía de 0 puntos de su marcador, también marcada por su duelo pendiente de la jornada pasada ante Errecé a causa de problemas de salud.


  Por último, Sweet Pain y Gazir, segundo y tercero en la tabla respectivamente, se enfrentarán en el duelo estrella de la jornada por consolidarse como el aspirante a rivalizar con Bnet por el anillo de campeón.


  La batalla se antoja clave en las aspiraciones de ambos competidores por mantenerse en la carrera por el título y, en base a la plenitud en su estado de forma, promete ser un espectáculo de máximo nivel

"It's too early to really jump to conclusions as to the implications of what the specific mutations have," WHO Chief Scientist Soumya Swaminathan said during the briefing.

We’re left with a slick 80 minutes of standup storytelling, scripted to the hilt, with callbacks in all the right places and some choice gags: the one about compromise, at the moment his relationship expires, is very fine. The closing section, with its carnal tragicomedy and emotional intimacies, is particularly compelling – not least because it returns us, at last, to the show we were meant to be getting all along.

"La fiscal no menciona por ningún lado que hay crímenes de lesa humanidad, no dice cuándo se van a iniciar las investigaciones, más bien al contrario, en su nota de prensa dice que se mantendrá el examen preliminar y luego se decidirá si se abre la investigación, eso es una afrenta, una burla a los venezolanos y a la justicia internacional", aseveró Walter Márquez.


  Rechazó la manera como la fiscal ha dilatado las investigaciones sobre Venezuela cuando hay suficientes pruebas y elementos de convicción.

In the most recent fiscal period ending November 1, these factors more than offset the negative dollar impact of recently reduced dining room capacity due to the resurgence of the pandemic and the impact of Halloween, which occurred on Saturday this year. Overall, as our dine-in business continues to grow, we are flowing more dollars to the bottom line. Our comp PPA growth has been positive since the beginning of the fourth fiscal quarter, generating higher sales due to enterprise level pricing of approximately 1.5%, new laminated menus that are positively impacting sales mix and profitability, and increased on-premise dining capacity. We will complete the rollout of booth divider panels by Thanksgiving, which will maximize indoor seating capacity in all locations.
