Let it be said that the right skirt can be a wardrobe life changer. We're going out on a limb to say this is that skirt. Soft-ribbed and stretchy in all the right ways, comfy but chic with a front slit, you could easily wear this with your fave graphic tee and sneaks, or knee-high boots and a chunky sweater, or when the weather warms up, a nice sandal and a slinky tank.

Many years back, I belonged to an online group of women who were all having trouble conceiving or carrying to term. A smallish group of us took our friendship off the public forum into an email chain between only us so we could discuss our problems (and victories) in a more private setting.
 In this group was a Boston woman, Christina, who had suffered two miscarriages, her second being a tubal pregnancy that nearly took her life. Our group was there to console Christina a few months later when the doctor said she was no longer physically capable of bearing a child.
 Her endometriosis had already been significant enough for her to have been told, a year or two earlier, that pregnancy would be unlikely, but the added damage caused by the tubal removed every possibility she could ever become pregnant again. The bridge had been blown, so to speak. And the surrounding ground left too unstable for a surgical work-around.
 Right around this same time, Christina’s mother-in-law, Rose, was diagnosed with an especially grim-sounding cancer, with “tentacles” wrapping around her heart in a way that made most traditional treatments not feasible. It could not be surgically removed. She was given just a few months to live.
 Christina used to joke she only married her husband to get to his mom. The two women were especially close, and Christina was having a difficult time handling the diagnosis. Her own health soon began to falter. She was exceedingly tired. Swollen. Frequently queasy.
 Especially in the mornings.
 Yep. Somehow, an ambitious little swimmer had made it through. Her obstetrician verified its location was sound. The pregnancy wouldn’t be without risks, but a miracle had occurred. The impossibility disproven.
 Before Christina could call her mother-in-law to share the news, her phone rang. It was Rose. She’d just come from the oncologist — where she’d been told her cancer appeared to be dead.
 Christina and her husband ended up with three daughters, and the last time we talked, Rose was still going strong.
 Oh yeah. There’s one detail I didn’t mention. It’s that these women had faith, believed completely and unabashedly in the power of prayer and weren’t afraid to ask others to aim some prayers on their behalf.
 Their experience reminds me of another, shared by a young surgical nurse. On her floor was a patient — a middle-aged woman — who was scheduled for exploratory surgery to evaluate whether a large cancerous mass in her stomach could be removed.
 A group from the woman’s church came and prayed over her “ferociously.” I’ll never forget her use of that word. She said they stayed through the night in the waiting room, never even pausing to rest.
 When the surgeons opened the woman, they discovered the mass was completely gone.
 The nurse asked one of the surgeons if the tests could have been wrong, if there might have never been a mass to begin with. He shook his head no. He said in his years as a surgeon, he’d seen that same sort of thing a number of times. He said there seemed to be no rhyme or reason for whose fervent prayers would get answered or why — some were and others weren’t — but he’d stopped being surprised when it would happen again.

A Cabinet secretary in the administration of Gov. Laura Kelly convened an unadvertised auction in a state senator's office Thursday to sell the second- biggest typical deer antler rack in recorded Kansas history that was at the center of a celebrated ownership feud because the buck was shot by a poacher in Osage County.
 Possession of the 14-point rack inspired an emotional legal and political dispute between landowner Tim Nedeau, who claimed rights to the trophy illegally shot in 2011, and Kansas Department of Wildlife, Parks and Tourism officials who contended Nedeau shouldn't receive the ill-gotten mount worth thousands of dollars. Even after conviction of poacher David Kent, of Topeka, and changes to state law giving landowners first-refusal rights to game from illegal hunting, the rack remained in the agency's hands.
 The monster's head will soon be on the move.
 Brad Loveless, secretary of the Department of Wildlife, Parks and Tourism, said in an interview he took the initiative to resolve the conflict by convening the meeting and conducting the accompanying auction in the office of Senate Minority Leader Anthony Hensley. The Democratic senator said he was surprised by the deal-closing auction because he thought the gathering was about negotiating a settlement.
 Loveless said invited bidders were Nedeau and a representative of Bass Pro Shops, which made an opening offer of $10,000. Nedeau responded with a bid of $10,001. That back-and-forth cycle repeated itself until Nedeau prevailed at $16,001.
 "We didn't advertise it. We didn't go through that process," said Loveless, who solicited involvement from Bass Pro Shops. "By no means were we trying to shut anyone out. We wanted to give him (Nedeau) a chance at this."
 The Cabinet secretary said proceeds from the sale would be deposited in the Operation Game Thief account, which provides rewards to people providing information to authorities leading to conviction of poachers. The secretary said consideration was given to burning the antlers, but the decision was made to generate needed funding for the anti-poaching program.
 The method of sale went against the grain because Kansas government agencies frequently dispose of surplus equipment and materials through the Manhattan- based Purplewave online auction house. The state sells everything from used prison denim jackets to snowplow trucks on a website open to the public for around-the-clock bidding.
 Nedeau, who previously won an $8,000 court judgment from the poacher, said he didn't want to discuss the transaction until he was in possession of the antlers.
 "No comment," he said.
 Rep. Ken Corbet, a Shawnee County Republican who advocated at the Statehouse on behalf of Nedeau's claim he should be given the deer's head, said he attended the meeting along with Hensley and state Rep. Brenda Dietrich, R-Topeka. All three serve constituents involved in the case.
 Corbet said the decision by the Department of Wildlife, Parks and Tourism to conduct a closed auction with participation of Bass Pro Shops meant the hunting, camping and fishing supply retailer based in Springfield, Mo., would set the minimum price Nedeau would pay to acquire the trophy. Decor of the company's stores includes taxidermy mounts native to the local area.
 "This was no more than Wildlife and Parks being a bully, thumbing its nose at the Legislature and landowners," said Corbet, who owns Ravenwood Lodge, a hunting and shooting facility outside Topeka. "I thought it would be a resolution where they just give him the antlers."
 Hensley said he had been told the meeting in his Capitol office would be to discuss a resolution, but he wasn't warned about the auction. Hensley said the Cabinet secretary used a cellphone to bring the Bass Pro Shop representative into the conversation.
 "I had no idea that this is what was going to happen," the Topeka Democratic senator said. "I had no idea they were going to have an auction. I think it was really mishandled."
 Kent told state wildlife officials he was driving to get firewood on Nov. 11, 2011, when he saw the buck near the intersection of 133rd Street and Wanamaker Road, a rural area south of Topeka. He fired two shots from a 9mm Glock. The animal went down 50 yards from his vehicle. Kent ran to the buck, decapitated it with a knife, wrapped the head in a blanket and drove off.
 In 2012, state wildlife department officers seized the antlers at the Kansas Expocentre in Topeka, where Kent entered them in the Mossy Oak Buck Classic. Nedeau sought a salvage tag for the buck since it died on his property in Osage County. In 2013, Nedeau appealed to Gov. Sam Brownback to release the antlers to him.
 The Legislature passed a bill in 2014 granting landowners first chance to claim animal parts if game was taken illegally on their land, but the measure signed by Brownback wasn't retroactive. The Department of Wildlife, Parks and Tourism subsequently balked at giving the antlers to Nedeau after determining the land where the buck died was owned by Nedeau's mother.

When Kea Turner's 74-year-old grandmother checked into Virginia's Sentara Virginia Beach General Hospital with advanced lung cancer, she landed in the oncology unit where every patient was monitored by a bed alarm.      "Even if she would slightly roll over, it would go off," Turner said. Small movements - such as reaching for a tissue - would set off the alarm, as well. The beeping would go on for up to 10 minutes, Turner said, until a nurse arrived to shut it off.      Tens of thousands of alarms shriek, beep and buzz every day in every U.S. hospital. All sound urgent, but few require immediate attention or get it.      Intended to keep patients safe alerting nurses to potential problems, they also create a riot of disturbances for patients trying to heal and get some rest.      Nearly every machine in a hospital is now outfitted with an alarm - infusion pumps, ventilators, bedside monitors tracking blood pressure, heart activity and a drop in oxygen in the blood. Even beds are alarmed to detect movement that might portend a fall. The glut of noise means that the medical staff is less likely to respond.      Alarms have ranked as one of the top 10 health technological hazards every year since 2007, according to the research firm ECRI Institute. That could mean staffs were too swamped with alarms to notice a patient in distress or that the alarms were misconfigured. The Joint Commission, which accredits hospitals, warned the nation about the "frequent and persistent" problem of alarm safety in 2013. It now requires hospitals to create formal processes to tackle alarm system safety, but there is no national data on whether progress has been made in reducing the prevalence of false and unnecessary alarms.      The commission has estimated that of the thousands of alarms going off throughout a hospital every day, an estimated 85% to 99% do not require clinical intervention. Staff, facing widespread "alarm fatigue," can miss critical alerts, leading to patient deaths. Patients may get anxious about fluctuations in heart rate or blood pressure that are perfectly normal, the commission said.      And bed alarms, a recent arrival, can lead to immobility and dangerous loss of muscle mass when patients are terrified that any movement will set off the bleeps.      An 'epidemic of immobility'   In the past 30 years, the number of medical devices that generate alarms has risen from about 10 to nearly 40, said Priyanka Shah, a senior project engineer at ECRI Institute. A breathing ventilator alone can emit 30 to 40 different noises, she said.      In addition to triggering bed alarms, patients who move in bed may set off false alarms from pulse oximeters, which measure the oxygen in a patient's blood, or carbon dioxide monitors, which measure the level of the gas in someone's breath, she said.      Shah said she has seen hospitals reduce unneeded alarms, but doing so is "a constant work in progress."      'Cry wolf phenomenon'   Maria Cvach, an alarm expert and director of policy management and integration for Johns Hopkins Health System, found that on one step-down unit (a level below intensive care) in the hospital in 2006, an average of 350 alarms went off per patient per day, from the cardiac monitor alone.      She said no international standard exists for what these alarms sound like, so they vary by manufacturer and device. "It's really impossible for the staff to identify by sound everything that they hear," she said.      The flood of alarms creates a "cry wolf phenomenon," Cvach said. The alarms are "constantly calling for help. The staff look at them. They say that's just a false alarm - they may ignore the real alarm."      Bed alarms, for example, are meant to summon nurses so they can supervise patients to walk safely. But research has shown that the use of alarms doesn't prevent falls. Nursing staffs are often stretched thin and don't reach the bedside before a patient hits the ground.      Meanwhile, patients may feel immobilized at a time when even a few hundred steps per day could significantly improve their recovery. Immobility in the hospital can create other problems for patients, leaving them with often irreversible functional decline, research has shown.      Bed alarms have proliferated since 2008, when the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services declared hospital falls should "never" happen and stopped paying for injuries related to those falls. After that policy change, the odds of nurses using a bed alarm increased 2.3 times, according to a study led by Dr. Ronald Shorr, director of the Geriatric Research, Education and Clinical Center at the Malcom Randall Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Gainesville, Florida. The alarms have become a standard feature in new hospital beds.      But Shorr noted that, in contrast, bed alarms are being removed from other settings: In 2017, CMS began discouraging their widespread use in nursing homes, arguing that audible bed or chair alarms may be considered a "restraint" if the resident "is afraid to move to avoid setting off the alarm."

Perched above a beautiful setting surrounded by water, palm trees and historic buildings, Ponce Inlet, Florida, offers travelers scenic views, science and more.      Inlet visitors can climb 175 feet, up 203 stairs, to reach a beautiful view of the Atlantic Ocean and the inlet at the Ponce De Leon Inlet Light Station. The complex features the lighthouse, Ponce Inlet Museum and the buildings once used by the U.S. Coast Guard.      The museum offers self-guided tours that take a deep look into the history of the lighthouse and light station. Learn about the men and their families who were the lighthouse keepers and took charge of lighting the paths for those at sea.   The lighthouse became automated in 1953. In 1970 the Coast Guard moved from the light station, leaving the historic structures vacant. A lot of damage was done by vandals -- however, citizens took it upon themselves to get the property deeded to the town of Ponce Inlet. The property was restored to a museum and the station was listed on the National Register of Historic Places -- one of only a few light stations that had the buildings intact. It is now listed as a privately operated aid to navigation.      Guided group tours for 10 or more are available. For those wanting a different experience, sign up for the Climb to the Moon tour. The "old lighthouse keeper" will take history buffs on a trip to discover the history of the lighthouse. It takes place monthly on the eve of each full moon. Dates and times are listed at ponceinlet.org. The climb offers awesome moonlit views of the Atlantic Ocean, the world's most famous beach (Daytona), the inlet and inland waterways. Toast the full moon with a sparkling beverage as it rises over the water. Hors d'oeuvres are provided. Tickets may be purchased in advance by emailing admin@ponceinlet.org or calling 386-210-3660, ext. 10.      Or, take the two-hour Climb with the Keeper Tour. It is an intimate, informative time with the "old lighthouse keeper" to tour the museum when no other guests are present. It includes the entire lighthouse area and some that are normally closed to the general public. To jump in on this tour, email mwentzel@ponceinlet.org or call 386-210-3660, ext. 18.   Reservations are required for the special tours, and each costs $35 per person.      Tips for your visit:   • Climbers should be in good physical condition.   • Wear closed-toed shoes with non-slip soles and low heels. Flip-flops, sandals and high-heeled shoes are not recommended.   • Children must be able to climb the tower on their own.      Another climb awaits Ponce Inlet visitors at the observation tower at the Marine Science Center. The tower offers views of the estuary. Spend time with the turtles, eagles, owls and hawks, and feed the stingrays. A visit offers a great behind the scenes look into the rescue, rehabilitation and release of sick and injured turtles and birds. Visitors can observe the sea turtle patients and the operation of the hospital. It offers an opportunity to learn about the Florida marine ecosystems and animals that are indigenous to the area.      Touch a stingray and explore the nature trail; walk through the Mary Keller Bird Sanctuary, an area where the birds that no longer can live in the wild live a good life in Florida. During the Raptors Live program, visitors meet the birds of prey up close. Animal education programs are presented daily. Visit marinesciencecenter.com for times and pricing.

Helping clients to respond positively to sudden and unexpected change is what our mature and committed team does for our clients. Perhaps that is why our team relished this year as an opportunity to “hit the reset button” to improve our system of providing services for elder care planning and crisis guidance.
 It is sobering that a person who is 65 today has a 70% chance of needing some type of long-term care service; and the age that such a need usually becomes evident is around 81. Many of our clients are understandably anxious when we first meet with them. As we reset our focus, we are committed to help our clients to recognize and build on what they might have already accomplished, rather than to scare them into spending money unnecessarily, as some attorneys seem to do.
 Sometimes clients discover us when they are in the middle of a long-term care crisis that has caused a loved one to be in a hospital or nursing home. It can be even worse when we get a desperate call about a loved one who remains at home precariously. We coach families how to reset expectations when a loved one with dementia is personally stubborn, or that person’s spouse feels trapped by a promise that “I’ll never put you in a nursing home.”
 Especially in the case of a physically active loved one with advancing dementia, the need for 24/7 observation and supervision eventually will surpass the ability of any individual caregiver. Most families, and especially those who do not have long-term care insurance, lack the financial resources to pay for in-home care “around the clock.”
 When we encounter clients experiencing such sudden events or tragic situations, we immediately help the clients to address their understandable economic fears with an optimal strategy to reset their assets to save as much as possible. This sometimes includes a plan to transfer assets within the family, legally and without penalty.
 The individual fact patterns of each case are unique. Our triage process allows us to focus on what needs to be a priority. The expression “inch by inch, life is a cinch” can ultimately feel true even for those clients who initially express fear of being overwhelmed by details and emotions.

Si bien la actuación de Furdik podría hacerlo más reconocible para los fanáticos, también trabajó detrás de escena en Game of Thrones como coordinador de especialistas durante las primeras cinco temporadas del programa. Furdik llevó ese talento a The Witcher , donde fue responsable de casi todas las peleas en la primera temporada, salvo uno: la pelea de Blaviken (esta secuencia fue coordinada por Wolfgang Stegemann). Dada la fuerza de las escenas de lucha en The Witcher , parece que la presencia de Furdik debería considerarse bienvenida. Desafortunadamente para los fanáticos, el coreógrafo no regresará para la temporada 2. Según Redanian Intelligence , Furdik mencionó muy brevemente su partida a un fan en Instagram, pero no dio detalles adicionales.

He told the gathering that the Chinese companies were not only ready to invest in Pakistan but also willing to transfer technology to enhance productivity by establishing technical training institutes in the country.
 He also asked the Punjab government to expedite working on other SEZs planned in the province and assured all out support by the federal government.
 The prime minister lauded the performance of the new administrative machinery in Punjab and said the bureaucracy had been left with no excuse to perform after the federal government had amended the NAB ordinance to ebb away the procedural pressure from them.
 He also appreciated the newly posted Inspector General of Punjab Police Shoaib Dastgir for making a good start by arresting the notorious robbers gangs from different cities who, he viewed, sometimes also enjoyed the patronage of some politicians. The prime minister hoped that the province would be purged of such criminals within next two to three months.
 He also spoke high of the Punjab chief minister for being available to the people and leading a simple life that was also expected from a political leader of the country bearing the burden of foreign debts.
 Earlier, the prime minister also criticized the political leaders for unnecessarily speaking English to the Pakistani audience at public gathering or even at the parliament where majority could not understand English properly. He viewed that English should be used in higher education but not as a tool of class distinction or to humiliate the poor people who could not speak or understand the language.
 Earlier, Chief Minister Punjab Sardar Usman Buzdar said the Punjab government had allocated Rs 5 billion for the industrial city to be established over 3,217 acres. Spanned over stretch of around 22 kilometers, the city would also house a police station, labour colony, TEVTA Institute and a hospital which were nearing completion.
 Another industrial city was also being developed on Motorway M-3 over 4,500 acres and was expected to be inaugurated in March this year.
 He said the Punjab government had planned 10 SEZs in the province with six of those had already been approved by the federal government and rest were in the pipeline.
 He said the Punjab government had also given Rs 1.5 billion to Technical Education and Vocational Training Authority (TEVTA) to train around 150,000 people and the number would be increased to one million. Besides, the provincial government had also allocated Rs 6 billion to provide loan to youth, he added.

We have countenanced both the ugly racial backlash against Barack Obama’s presidency and a hysterical anti-immigrant movement. Both should have made us take to the proverbial streets.
 We haven’t done enough to invest in shaping economies of the future, and instead have thrown up our hands and blamed technology, deindustrialization and globalization. The kind of strategic, long-term action that is probably needed might be inconvenient and costly, so we kicked the can down the road.
 Shared sacrifice? What’s that?
 And that list doesn’t even include two of the most explosive issues of generational conflict — access to adequate and affordable health care and the skyrocketing costs of education and the resulting crisis of debt.
