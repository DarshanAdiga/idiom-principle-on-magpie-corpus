The climate emergency and irreversible biodiversity loss have reached critical levels, while the political space for civil society organizations in many countries is shrinking or has disappeared entirely.

Finally, the longest-lasting, deepest-reaching political project that the DPP should tackle is the cultivation of talent. It has tended to appoint the people who decide its Aboriginal policies from among Aboriginal activists in democratic and social movements.

Within its male-dominated community, Lakatos, born in Budapest but with roots in Nagyecsed, says its members respect traditions like not holding hands or declaring love in public.

“If people don’t know a culture then maybe they can be afraid or suspicious of it,” she noted.

Large-scale infrastructure projects such as export corridors, power plants and large dams invariably carry high environmental and social risks. They are also all too often linked to corruption and increasing levels of public debt. Their impact can transform entire regions, affect countless communities, and contribute to climate change and irreversible biodiversity loss.

But “our common language of music is a link bringing people together,” she said, adding that festival-goers in Hungary often tell her after concerts that they didn’t know about Olah Gypsy music until seeing her.

To do a proper job of providing grassroots services, local DPP elected representatives and party members should connect with Aborigines whose political views are nearer to those of the DPP. They should take the initiative by going to communities and finding out what problems there are, so that they can look after people’s everyday needs.

The PPI’s principles — including a “presumption in favor of disclosure” — are welcome, but insufficient. The policy includes so many exceptions that decisions about which documents the AIIB discloses ultimately reside with its president.


--DocBreak--
The current ESF (2016) includes two paragraphs on information disclosure. They do not mention essential time frames for the public release of documents, such as environmental and social impact assessments.


--DocBreak--
Instead, the ESF calls for documents to be made available in a “timely” manner or, “as soon as they become available.”

However, rank-and-file civil servants and teachers have greater influence in Aboriginal communities, because they are highly visible, perform many services and are closest to their residents.

The next thing the DPP should do is pay attention to the services it provides at the grassroots level. Although the DPP calls itself a Taiwan-centric party and Tsai has publicly apologized for successive governments’ longstanding lack of respect for Aborigines, these things have no practical effect.

Ruling Democratic Party chairman and former South Korean prime minister Lee Nak-yon also praised the late Samsung chief for his “superb innovation that is unimaginable to an average man.”

Unlike more widely known strings-based Hungarian Gypsy music, the Olah version uses traditional percussive instruments like water urns, wooden tubs and spoons, as well as a beatbox-like sound called “vocal-bassing.”

The AIIB’s main policy instruments regarding transparency and public access to information are its 2018 Policy on Public Information (PPI), and its 2016 Environmental and Social Framework (ESF), which was amended last year. In September last year, the AIIB published the draft of a revised ESF, which the bank’s board is scheduled to approve in February following a public consultation period.


--DocBreak--
Furthermore, the AIIB has adopted a governance model that emphasizes “efficiency.” Under the institution’s so-called “accountability framework,” the board of directors, which represents member countries, delegates increasing decisionmaking power regarding project financing to the bank’s president.

“It’s important that this musical culture is passed on at home, in case later generations are only able to learn about it from books,” she said.

Transparency and public participation are paramount in managing the risks of such projects, but the AIIB’s driving force and largest shareholder, the Chinese government, operates in a political context without checks and balances. It has increasingly tightened its grip on domestic civil society and the media, and has largely silenced defenders of human rights and even public health.

Meanwhile, South Korea’s billionaire business leaders yesterday lined up to pay respects to Lee Kun-hee, who died aged 78 on Sunday, six years after suffering a heart attack that had left him bedridden.

Such loopholes clearly allow financial or corporate interests to outweigh the public’s interest in learning of environmental and social risks ahead of time.


--DocBreak--
The proposed framework is also strikingly weak in addressing the growing trend of channeling investments through financial intermediaries such as commercial banks and private equity funds. Even when these entities finance high-risk activities with AIIB support, they are not required to publish specific information regarding environmental and social impact.

DPP Legislator Saidhai Tahovecahe (伍麗華), who is based in Pingtung County, is a good example of this. She started out as a teacher and later became an elementary-school principal. During those years, she accumulated a lot of experience providing services at the community level.

However, the AIIB is to increasingly develop its own lending pipeline — under its own rules — with the objective of becoming the global leader in infrastructure finance. It is likely to target Africa, Latin America and Europe, as well as Asia.


--DocBreak--
The AIIB responded by using language and terminology that are carefully tailored to Western sensibilities, but upon closer reading, this content often turns out to be shallow and imprecise.


--DocBreak--
To prevent and alleviate harm, the AIIB should ensure full disclosure of environmental and social impact assessments, including plans for land acquisition and resettlement, prior to project approval, when there is still a chance to influence the outcome.

That being the case, when general elections — and legislative elections in particular — near, the DPP Central Committee should keep a close eye on whether the police and prosecutors are doing their duty by investigating vote- buying, and dealing with it firmly but fairly when it happens.
