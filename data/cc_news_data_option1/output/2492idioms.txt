Amid calls to change the Splash Mountain theme park ride because of its ties with “Song of the South,” the 1946 movie many view as racist, Disney officials said Thursday it was recasting the ride to make it based on “The Princess and the Frog,” the 2009 Disney film with an African American female lead.
 The changes to the ride will be made at Disneyland in California and the Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World in Florida, the company said in a post.
 Disney said the changes had been in the works since last year, but the announcement comes as companies across the U.S. are renaming racially-charged, decades-old brands in the wake of protests for racial justice around the globe following the death of George Floyd at the hands of police in Minnesota last month.
 “The new concept is inclusive – one that all of our guests can connect with and be inspired by, and it speaks to the diversity of the millions of people who visit our parks each year,” the Disney post said.

For months, the industry has been talking about how it's likely going to be a lot easier for smaller, more adaptable productions (like indie films) to shoot in the COVID-19 era than big blockbusters. But across the board, the guidelines (which everyone agrees are a smart and necessary part of restarting productions) are reshaping the entire methodology of how shooting has typically worked. Spreading out workers to maintain social distancing regulations inherently slows down the time it takes to accomplish tasks which used to be performed almost quickly and efficiently.

Johnny Ray Bunn, known to his grandsons as "Pawtchy", 63, passed away peacefully on Wednesday at home surrounded by his family. His passing marks the end of a long battle with cancer that Johnny fought with grace and so much humor. Johnny was a lifelong resident of Huntsville. He attended Mountain Gap Elementary and Middle Schools and was one of the first graduating classes of Grissom High School. He and his wife ran a successful local business for 33 years and he was a major part of the local heating and air conditioning community. Johnny Bunn never met a stranger and lit up every room he entered. He used his humor to bring laughter to everyone around him, even in the toughest of times. He loved animals and even rehabilitated several baby raccoons in his lifetime. He and his wife traveled as often as they could, and he was always ready for an adventure. He was an avid hunter, a loyal friend and proud grandpa. Despite a years long battle with cancer, he spent much of his healthy time in the past several years volunteering at Clearview Cancer Institute (CCI) to give back to other cancer patients. In 2018, he put his bushy white beard to use as a local Santa Claus. He loved playing Santa and was proud to collect 1700 toys for children with cancer or children of cancer patients at CCI. He is survived by the love of his life, his wife of almost 30 years, Leigh; his brother, Neal; his son, Jason and wife, Cherie; his grandson, Isaiah; his daughter, Jennifer and husband, Dustin; his grandson, Carsyn; his son, Matthew; his daughter, Jessica; and his dog, Maggie Mae. He is preceded in death by his mother, Jeanette Lawley Bunn, who passed in 2013 and his father, Johnny Fay Bunn, who passed March 31, 2020. In light of COVID-19, we sadly are not able to have a visitation or funeral open to the public. Memorials may be made in his name to Russel Hill Cancer Foundation which funds CCI. While everyone who knew him will grieve this huge loss, remember that if Johnny were here, he would say, "It's all good!"

The zombies, however much blood they're covered in, are just one of the movie's generic traits. Though "Yummy" has some intestines-yanking and limb- chewing, it's too easily to imagine that these zombies could have walked off the set of any other zed-flick. “Yummy” is then so haphazard with setting up zombie moments for its make-up team to shine that even gratuitous amusement eludes it.
 Despite its setting having great potential for comedy, the movie still has a rotten sense of humor that it mistakes for being dark and biting. Just like its few obvious scare moments (like inserted security camera footage), "Yummy" is far too lazy in setting up its gross-out gags, like the way it builds to a guy’s penis being lit on fire. The movie's sense of comedic rhythm is nearly nonexistent, and the best that the story can do is splatter stuff on its characters. Even then, with Michael’s sole characteristic being his gag reflex to seeing blood, you know what’s going to happen if he sees too much.
 Fitting to how comedy often just goes mean when it doesn’t have any new ideas, “Yummy” mistakes its shocking sense of humor for virtually hating its characters. That’s especially the case with how it treats women, as in a scene where one woman's lazily executed death scene is punctuated with a shot looking up at her legs from behind. It's not clever, it's just pathetic. And then there's the ending, which shoehorns a rape attempt for good measure, and then does away with the one idea that gives the story a heartbeat, just for the sake of proving that it can do whatever it wants to these characters. There’s no sense in this finale that "Yummy" is trying to say something about rotten luck. It’s more a confirmation that "Yummy" is clueless on how to make horror even slightly fun, or funny.

“Why is it important for people to gather together in person, physically, in the flesh?” Wilcoxen explained. “God works through physical means. He took on human flesh and blood in the person of his Son, Jesus Christ so that he could save us from our sin and its consequences, eternal death and slavery to the devil. This rescue climaxed with his death on the cross and resurrection from the dead three days later. Now he uses physical means to give us the forgiveness, life, and salvation he won on the cross. In the water and God’s Word that combine to make up baptism, he gives us the gift of saving faith in him. In the Word, he preaches his forgiveness into our ear holes. In the Lord’s Supper, he gives us his own body and blood, hidden under the bread and wine, in an intimate act of love and forgiveness.”

Ferguson said the department expects the release on Friday of what is expected to be a harsh report on the supervision of district task forces. Cantrell acknowledged that the department still needs to improve the oversight of officers.
 The report on task forces that is coming Friday, which Ferguson has said contains “extremely troubling” allegations, threatens to derail the NOPD’s plan to exit the most intensive phase of federal monitoring this year.
 Ferguson noted the impending report last month when he announced he was shelving the task forces, which are specialized units in each of NOPD's eight districts that do proactive policing rather than respond to calls for service. For the time being, members of the task forces are responding to calls for service.
 The NOPD is also facing criticism from protesters and City Council members for its decision to use teargas on a large crowd on the approach to the Crescent City Connection on June 3.
 Despite her comment about the cost of the monitors, who are led by an attorney at the Washington-based white-shoe law firm Sheppard Mullin, she thanked them and U.S. District Judge Susie Morgan for ushering in reforms over the past decade.
 The cost of the monitoring team’s presence in New Orleans is simply too great to justify as the city grapples with the economic body blow of the pandemic, she argued.
 Morgan approved a three-year, $6.4 million contract extension for the monitors in August 2017 that is paid by the city. The NOPD budget this year is $193 million.

 # Modest gains for US job market might be leveling off
 Christopher Rugaber
 The Associated Press
 WASHINGTON — The number of laid-off workers seeking U.S. unemployment aid barely fell last week, and the reopening of small businesses has leveled off — evidence that the job market’s gains may have stalled just as a surge in coronavirus cases is endangering an economic recovery.
 The government also reported Thursday that the economy contracted at a 5% annual rate in the first three months of the year, a further sign of the damage being inflicted by the viral pandemic. The economy is expected to shrink at a roughly 30% rate in the current quarter. That would be the worst quarterly contraction, by far, since record-keeping began in 1948. Economists do expect a snap-back in the second half of the year, though not enough to reverse all the damage.
 Last week, the number of people applying for jobless benefits declined slightly to 1.48 million. It was the 12th straight weekly drop. An additional 700,000 people applied through a program for self-employed and gig workers that made them eligible for aid for the first time. These figures aren’t adjusted for seasonal variations, so the government doesn’t include them in the official count.
 Combining those figures, overall applications for jobless aid have edged down just 3% in the past two weeks – a much slower pace than in late April and May.
 “There has been no real decline in weekly claims the past two weeks,” said Julia Pollak, a labor economist at ZipRecruiter. “There has also been no real increase in job openings. What seemed like encouraging signs of recovery in May largely stalled in June.”
 A separate government report Thursday said orders for durable goods unexpectedly jumped nearly 16% in May, reflecting a rebound in some business activity. Still, the pace of orders and shipments remains far below pre- pandemic levels. And excluding the volatile transportation category, so-called core orders rose only modestly, reflecting still-sluggish business investment.
 The virus is once again squeezing companies across the economy.
 Disney is postponing the scheduled mid-July reopening of its Southern California theme parks until it receives guidelines from the state. Macy’s is cutting nearly 4,000 corporate jobs – roughly 3% of its workforce – in response to financial strain caused by the virus.
 Apple announced late Wednesday that it would re-close seven of its stores in the Houston area, which is suffering a spike in cases. Last week, it had said would re-close 11 other stores in four states. And the parent company of Chuck E. Cheese restaurants will seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, in part because of the restaurants it has been forced to close as a result of the pandemic.
 Larry Kudlow, President Donald Trump’s top economic adviser, asserted Thursday on Fox Business that the economy is rebounding quickly.
 “I think the strong ‘V’ recovery is right still there,” Kudlow said, referring to the shape of a sharp rebound on a chart.
 Most private economists, though, foresee a much more tepid recovery. And the latest economic figures coincide with a sudden resurgence of COVID-19 cases in the United States, especially in the South and West, that is threatening to derail the nascent economic rebound. On Wednesday, the nation set a high for new confirmed coronavirus cases. Many states are establishing their own new peaks for confirmed daily infections, including Arizona, California, Mississippi, Nevada, Texas and Oklahoma. Cases of coronavirus have also jumped in Florida and Georgia.
 The number of infections is thought to be far higher still because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest that people can be infected with the virus without feeling sick.
 Should the trends continue, states may reimpose some limits on businesses that would likely trigger job cuts. And if not, consumers may choose to shop, eat out, and travel less.
 Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said Thursday that that state will suspend its business reopenings amid a surge in coronavirus infections.
 Real time data on small businesses suggests that the job market’s improvement slowed in June compared with May, when 2.5 million jobs were unexpectedly added. About 78% of small businesses have reopened as states have lifted shutdown orders, according to data from Homebase, a company that provides scheduling and time-tracking software to small businesses. Yet nationally, that figure has been flat for the past week.
 In states that are suffering spikes in COVID-19 cases, small businesses are closing again and cutting some jobs.
 Ray Sandza, an executive at Homebase, said the plateau in business reopenings is a worrisome sign that the remaining 20% of small companies could end up closing permanently.
 “If you haven’t reopened yet, the likelihood of coming back is low,” Sandza said.
 He noted that most small businesses had just one or two months’ of cash on hand when the pandemic intensified three months ago.
 In Florida, Texas, and Arizona, the proportion of small businesses that have closed has risen in the past week as a result of the resurgent viral outbreaks. And in Arizona, as of Monday, the number of employees working at small companies was 31% below the pre-pandemic level. That’s worse than the previous week, when it was 26.5%.
 Homebase’s data showed a solid rebound in jobs and hours worked in May that was consistent with the May jobs report, which also showed that the unemployment rate fell to 13.3% from 14.7%. Those are the two highest unemployment rates since the Great Depression.
 Other real-time data is showing similar results. Kronos, which also produces small business scheduling software, said the number of shifts worked is now growing at only half the pace it was in late April and May. And shifts worked have actually fallen in 10 states in the past week, according to Dave Gilbertson, a Kronos official.
 Thursday’s data on jobless claims included one bright spot: The total number of people receiving unemployment benefits aid fell to 19.5 million from 20.3 million, which suggests that employers are rehiring some workers.
 For the unemployed, the federal government has been providing $600 in weekly benefits, on top of whatever state jobless aid recipients are receiving. This federal money has pumped nearly $20 billion a week into the economy and enabled many of the unemployed to stay afloat.
 It has been a major help to Alexis O’Neill, who was laid off in March from an accounting job at an aviation fuel company. O’Neill, 49, who lives with her mother in Ann Arbor, Michigan, is looking for a job that would allow her to work from home so she could avoid putting her mother at risk of contracting the virus.
 She has applied for at least a dozen jobs but has received no responses except an acknowledgement of her application. Many open jobs now seem to offer lower pay than before the pandemic struck. Compounding the dilemma for O’Neill, Michigan is stuck with the nation’s second-highest state unemployment rate, 21.2%.
 “The job market is terrible,” she said. “Everything either pays so badly or doesn’t come with benefits.”

While addressing these issues is necessary at a time when Hollywood is reexamining their place in systemic racism that has plagued our society for years, simply ignoring these episodes of television and the mistakes within them feels like a bad idea. If anything, much like _Gone with the Wind_ being reinstated on HBO Max with accompany historical context provided, these episodes should be made available on streaming but with a disclaimer, possibly from a black comedian, about the offensive nature of blackface and the inappropriateness of it all. After all, some of these jokes are meant to mock the ignorance of people using blackface. Regardless, creators have deemed even this kind of satire as being inappropriate and unacceptable, and Hollywood must listen and must do better.

Wallace, amid the national outcry for an end to racial discrimination and police brutality in the wake of Floyd's death, successfully lobbied in early June for NASCAR to prohibit fans from displaying Confederate flags at its events.
 Fulp, though, encouraged fans through Facebook to wave the Civil War emblem.
 On Wednesday, he posted an invitation there, asking spectators to buy and display Confederate flags at his raceway’s “Heritage Night’’ on Saturday, despite state laws barring outdoor gatherings of more than 25 people during the pandemic. Cooper this week announced an extension of Phase 2 of the state's reopening plan.
 It is incumbent on local law enforcement to see that the speedway follows the law, Cooper's spokesman said.
 "As to the operation of the raceway, the mass gathering limit should be enforced by local authorities to prevent the spread of COVID-19,'' Porter said.
 Fulp, in announcing the upcoming event, wrote, “We believe it’s our right to protect the sport we love. Purchase your Confederate flags and caps here, along with your Christian flag, American flag, Donald Trump flag and caps.’’
 He encouraged fans who choose to wear masks to don them and wrote that the speedway will provide hand washing sinks and hand sanitizer. He ended the post with: “And don’t forget your 2nd Amendment right, 311 Speedway.’’
 While it is unclear whether Fulp’s post advertising “Bubba Rope” meets the standard to constitute a federal hate crime, the message inspired some to circulate petitions to boycott the race track. The NC Beat, a Facebook page with news and information about hate crimes, urged people on Wednesday to alert the FBI to the Fulp post.
 Staff at the U.S. Attorney's Office in Greensboro were unavailable for comment.
 Veteran civil rights activist and longtime NAACP member Malcolm Allen of Reidsville was saddened by news of Fulp’s post but heartened by the national support Wallace received.
 “There are some with hateful, racist spirits among us,’’ said Allen, who as a student at N.C. A&T in the early 1960s participated in the Woolworth sit-ins in downtown Greensboro.
 “But the good thing about it is to see the solidarity of all of those race car drivers, marching behind Bubba on the speedway. That lets us know that the majority of us are good people, kind people and on the same page,’’ Allen said.
 “A lot of the time, people do things for attention. And we cannot satisfy and serve their agenda by playing the game with them,’’ he said, discouraging acts of retribution.
 “It’s good to know who they are and where their heart is, but it’s better to look at the bigger picture … ,’’ Allen said. “When we see injustice, we need to point it out. It needs to be dealt with, but in a peaceful way.’’

 It was a competitive game until the decisive sixth inning. Pius managed to jump out to a 1-0 lead in the first inning. Two singles and an error led to the run.
 Pius then tacked on another run in the bottom of the third. A single, a passed ball and a ground out led to that run.
 Exmark got one run back in the top of the fourth. Caleb Jobman led off with a double and eventually scored on Adam Deboer's RBI single to make it 2-1.

Three candidates are in the running to lead the Eurogroup panel of eurozone finance ministers, a once powerful gathering that has lost lustre since the debt crisis, it was announced Thursday.
 Whoever takes on the role will face the towering challenge of dealing with the economic aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, which has plunged Europe into its deepest recession since World War II.
 A few hours before candidacies closed on Thursday, Spanish Economy Minister Nadia Calvino was seen as the favourite and will face two challengers.
 Ireland's Paschal Donohoe and Luxembourg's Pierre Gramegna are also in the running, with the winner voted by simple majority by the eurozone's 19 finance ministers on July 9.
 The new head of the Eurogroup will replace Mario Centeno, Portugal's soft- spoken finance minister who is stepping down after just two-and-a-half years.
 During his leadership, the Eurogroup saw its importance diminish from the headline-grabbing days of the debt crisis under the leadership of Jean-Claude Juncker from Luxembourg and Jeroen Dijsselbloem from the Netherlands.
 In theory, the head of the Eurogroup has a central role: he or she chairs the monthly meetings of the finance ministers of the countries that have adopted the single currency.
 The main objective of the meeting is to better coordinate national economic policies and apply pressure on countries to keep their budgets in order.
 In this capacity, they must be able to strike a compromise between the rich members in the north, who insist on budgetary discipline, and those in the south, who are seen as more lax.

My concern now is how we communicate with each other. Back in the old days, if a salesperson needed to contact a prospective buyer, they might send a letter. After the letter arrived, the salesperson would call the prospect and maybe a set up a face to face meeting. The meeting would take place and hopefully the sale was completed. Today that entire process has been changed by technology. There are so many ways to contact someone that do not involve a telephone. Need to contact your boss, email them. Maybe you need to reach out to a friend, you can text a message to them. If you are on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter (or the many other choices in social media), you can send a message. During the current pandemic, the use of video conferencing has become a popular way to hold a meeting. This got me thinking, does anyone just pick up the phone and call people anymore?
