Charles was the most handsome, popular and charming of the Pélissier brothers – he even got on well with Desgrange, despite the sordid (and entirely believable) rumours of an affair with his wife. He was a dandy both on and off the bike who reportedly started a craze for white cycling socks. After a brilliant career, the younger of the brothers became a commentator for Radio Luxembourg before working in public relations and journalism.

Chief Minister Kamal Nath on Tuesday called on Governor Lalji Tandon and said that BJP could bring in no-confidence motion if it suspected that his government does not have numbers. However, he ruled out a floor test asserting that his government has the numbers to run the state.
   
   
 The Congress has alleged that 21 of its MLAs are being kept in the Bengaluru hotel — some being forcefully held in captive.
 "I am a Rajya Sabha candidate from Madhya Pradesh. The voting is scheduled for March 26. My MLAs have been kept here, they want to speak to me, their phones have been snatched, police is not letting me speak to them saying there is a security threat to MLAs," Digvijaya Singh said.
 Following the resignation of Madhya Pradesh leader Jyotiraditya Scindia from the Congress and the resultant exits of 21 Scindia camp MLAs from the Assembly, the Congress government in the state is on tenterhooks. While the Governor, Lalji Tandon, has ordered a floor test, the Assembly session on Monday got dismissed for coronavirus. The BJP has then moved the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, allegations of MLAs being traded have been lobbed against the BJP.

Infrastructure Canada has tried to keep the money flowing to cities and provinces as the federal bureaucracy works from home to heed public health advice. It is processing expense claims electronically and trying to accelerate funding approvals.
 "We are working with all our partners to move forward on what is required immediately in terms of infrastructure, what can be rolled out in the short- term to support jobs, and how we will restart our economy as quickly as possible," the department said.
 The Federation of Canadian Municipalities has asked the federal government for help to cover related cost overruns as the pandemic eats into transit, parking and recreational fee revenues. Toronto, for example, is losing about $65 million a week in revenues. Cities such as Edmonton and Ottawa have had to lay off staff as they face losses.
 None can run a deficit like provincial and federal governments, and some have only enough reserves to cover expenses for two or three months at most, said Karsten, a Halifax city councillor.
 "It's reached a point where if we don't have some real, tangible help and urgent financial support from the federal government, there are municipalities that are talking about their ability to stay solvent," he said.
 Mary Van Buren, president of the Canadian Construction Association, said her group is talking with the federal government about the design of an emergency fund to help extra costs for contractors.
 If a site is closed, for instance, the contractor covers extra costs related to leased equipment and site security.
 Delays to projects may be compounded by lags in getting materials once work restarts, Van Buren said. Many manufacturers have closed or significantly reduced capacity, meaning they'll need time to get back up to speed and improve inventories to meet demand, she said.
 "There is a huge list of costs that will be incurred and we can't ask the contractors to pick up all those costs. It's not reasonable given the situation we're in," Van Buren said in an interview.
 "So that is one of our asks — that there is an emergency fund created on the federal level to provide confidence to the contractors that they will be treated fairly."

THIS is so not Easter in Noosa, or the rest of the Sunshine Coast for that matter.
 It’s like you’ve gone to sleep one night and woken up in a parallel universe where the laws of gravity along with consumer disbelief have been suspended as fuel prices continue to fly in the face of Einstein’s lesser known Theory of Petrol Price Relativity.
 And that is: come Good Friday the cost of unleaded, e10, diesel and anything remotely spirits-based that can fire up a piston engine will go through the stratosphere … treble that if you live, work or play north of the Peregian Beach border.
 In Noosa it’s called making the trendy toffs pay, but it’s poor wage slaves like me who eke out a living there who are always caught up in the fuel corporates’ super profits’ gouge. We pay and pay, year after year through the nose while our hip pocket nerves badly haemorrhage.
 But not this year … it seems this year we’re no longer Easter bowser bunnies, always caught on the hop with an empty tank come Good Friday and in need of a small financial loan to fill up the tank.
 And for that, someone said you can thank the Russians and the Saudis for declaring an oil production stand-off to trigger a price-cutting war that’s seen prices plummet … with further speculation of sub $1 a litre prices in the offing at your local servo.
 The last time prices were that low, I don’t know, maybe Little Johnny Howard was hoping to become Lazarus with a triple bypass and be elected PM of Australia? Anyway, it was so long ago, pigs could actually fly in those days. But like the rest of my fellow patsies filling up at the pump this week, I was looking for the catch … that hidden whammy that we all know is staring us in the face.
 And there it was – the little TV screen at the bowser I was at, the ones the servos install hoping you lose concentration and pump in a few more extra dollars than you intended, spat it out.
 The newsflash was thanks to the COVID-19 crisis, the Gold Coast beaches are closed, interstate travel is banned and you can’t drive to Noosa for a swim without falling foul of the crack social distancing detective squads.
 Hell, they’ve even cancelled the free buses in Noosa in case we take to bus- ride binging and other crazy Easter antics.
 I and all my fellow non-travellers for the first time in our lives have an endless supply of affordable fuel at Easter and we’re grounded, stuck at home … at least until the all is well with the world and they spike the hell out of unleaded when you can least afford it, as they always do.
 Cue in the Alanis Morissette … “isn’t it ironic”. I was thinking, it’s more like highway robbery, as they’ve taken away our unalienable right to change the earth’ climate with all our holiday emissions. So, if you see someone in their carport, revving the engine, that’ll be me. I’ll be looking to get down to just under half a tank, like I always do before filling up, because I really want to make the most of these cheap prices one way or the other. How else am I allowed out of the house?

Additional shell eggs for consumers are available, but appropriately labeled retail packaging is not available for all such shell eggs.  Some of the available eggs are in flats, which typically hold 30 eggs and are normally sold to institutions and restaurants and are not labeled. Other available eggs could be placed in cartons, but appropriately labeled cartons are not available for all such eggs.

"I had no expectations going into the tournament in 2001. I had a very bad experience during the Sydney Olympics in 2000. I expected a lot in Sydney and ended up being bitterly disappointed so I made it a point to not go into All- England with any expectation. The lesson learnt at Olympics was so harsh that it was a deliberate ploy so as to avoid disappointment. I prepared very well, but had no expectations," Gopichand told _Times of India_.

MEDIA — The Foundation for Delaware County announced the first round of grants awarded from the Delaware County COVID-19 Response Fund, created last month by the community foundation in response to the current pandemic crisis. The grants come as the foundation crossed the $300,000 fundraising mark, including donations of as little as $10 contributed to help Delaware County nonprofits at the front lines supporting vulnerable residents who are bearing the greatest impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 The first wave of grants, totaling $73,655, was distributed to 11 nonprofits, each of which will receive a support grant to address emergency needs outlined in their proposals to the foundation. Grants are being awarded on a rolling basis during the coronavirus crisis, as donations continue to roll in. To date, the Response Fund has received more than 50 requests for funding; eligible nonprofits need only apply once.
 “The Delaware County COVID-19 Response Fund is a rapid response solution to provide resources to front-line organizations that are delivering emergency assistance, such as food security, healthcare, and childcare for the most vulnerable residents in this unprecedented crises,” said Mike Magnavita, chair of the Delaware County COVID-19 Response Fund and President of the Franklin Mint Federal Credit Union. “The selected organizations are deeply trusted organizations in their communities. They inspire us – and we know they are just a sampling of the work we can and must support moving forward.”

In The News is a roundup of stories from The Canadian Press designed to kickstart your day. Here is what's on the radar of our editors for the morning of April 8 ...
 COVID-19 in Canada ...
 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is expected to announce today further measures to financially support entrepreneurs, small businesses and young people who aren't eligible for previously unveiled emergency federal aid programs.
 Among other things, Trudeau is expected to announce a retooled Canada Summer Jobs program aimed at helping students find work in those industries that haven't shut down due to the deadly COVID-19 pandemic.
 The federal government has already unveiled the $24-billion Canada Emergency Response Benefit for people who've lost their jobs and a $71-billion wage subsidy program for companies that have lost 30 per cent of their revenues because of the health crisis.
 But in the rush to get those programs up and running as fast as possible, eligibility rules were set that threaten to leave hundreds of thousands of Canadians without financial assistance.
 An analysis by the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives last week estimated one-third of unemployed Canadians, about 862,000, won’t get help from employment insurance or the CERB. Another 390,000 will get some help, but below the $500 per week under the CERB.
 Among those who may be left out are contract or gig economy workers who want to keep small jobs or who can’t afford to go without work for two weeks to qualify for the emergency benefit.
 Volunteer firefighters or municipal politicians who receive an honorarium for their work, even if they have lost their day jobs due to COVID-19, could also be shut out.
 Trudeau has repeatedly affirmed that more help is coming for those who've fallen through the cracks between the emergency aid programs announced so far.

 The Trudeau government says 23 Canadians were being held at federal quarantine sites as the week began to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
 The newly released figure, the most current available, provides a glimpse into how the federal government is using its considerable powers under the Quarantine Act in an effort to contain the virus.
 The Public Health Agency of Canada says that as of Sunday night, the almost two dozen Canadians were in federally designated quarantine sites and federally supported self-quarantine lodgings.
 The agency set up the sites and says it is working with partners to manage them.
 Agency spokeswoman Maryse Durette says no information about the location of the sites is being disclosed to protect the privacy of quarantined Canadians.
 Under the Quarantine Act, the health minister can designate any place in Canada as a quarantine facility.
 An emergency order under the quarantine law requires all travellers returning to Canada to immediately self-isolate for 14 days. Those with symptoms must put on a mask before leaving the airport.

 COVID-19 in the U.S. ...
 President Donald Trump threatened to freeze U.S. funding to the World Health Organization, saying the international group had “missed the call” on the coronavirus pandemic.
 Trump also played down the release of January memos from a senior adviser that represented an early warning of a possible coronavirus pandemic, saying he had not seen them at the time. But he turned his anger on the WHO, first declaring that he would cut off U.S. funding for the organization, then backtracking and saying he would “strongly consider” such a move.
 Trump said the international group had “called it wrong” on the virus and that the organization was “very China-centric" in its approach, suggesting that the WHO had gone along with Beijing's efforts months ago to minimize the severity of the outbreak. The WHO has praised China for its transparency on the virus, even though there has been reason to believe that more people died of COVID-19 than the country’s official tally.
 “They should have known and they probably did know," Trump said of WHO officials.
 Throughout his presidency, Trump has voiced skepticism toward many international organizations and has repeatedly heaped scorn on the WHO. In its most recent budget proposal, in February, the Trump administration called for slashing the U.S. contribution to the WHO from an estimated $122.6 million to $57.9 million.
 The organization's current guidance does not advocate closing borders or restricting travel, though many nations, including the United States, have enacted those steps. The WHO declared COVID-19 a public health emergency on Jan. 30, nearly a month before Trump tweeted that "The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA" and a full 43 days before he declared a national emergency in the United States.

 Wuhan's unprecedented lockdown served as a model for countries battling the coronavirus around the world. With restrictions now lifted, Hubei's provincial capital embarks on another experiment: resuming business and ordinary life while seeking to keep the number of new cases down.
 As of just after midnight Wednesday, the city's 11 million residents are now permitted to leave without special authorization as long as a mandatory smartphone application powered by a mix of data-tracking and government surveillance shows they are healthy and have not been in recent contact with anyone confirmed to have the virus.

When Boston Heights resident Lynn Remly started her cruise March 7, the itinerary was clear.
   
 The Zaandam, a Holland America Line cruise ship, would take her and its 1,200 passengers around the west and east coasts of South America before returning to the United States.
   
 Along the way, of course, would be the cities and sites she had planned to see: Buenos Aires, Argentina; Montevideo, Uruguay; the Falkland Islands and other spots of interest.
   
 She was excited about getting to visit Punta Arenas, Chile, again. A museum in one of the world's most southern big cities is one of her favorites.
   
 The coronavirus crisis wasn't on her list.
   
 But on the way to Tierra Del Fuego, Remly's scheduled 14-day trip was invaded by the coronavirus and became the "cruise from hell," she said.
   
 "On the 14th, we went ashore, and that was the last day we went to shore," Remly said. "The captain sent notice that we were not going to dock anywhere in Argentina."
   
 Passengers and crew on the ship were becoming ill with flu-like symptoms.
   
 With Argentina off the agenda, the captain turned back to Punta Arenas. The thought was that the Zaandam would dock and Remly and her fellow passengers would catch flights home.
   
 A deal negotiated by Holland America to allow passengers to disembark fell apart as Chilean authorities changed their minds. Chile wanted the ship to quarantine for two weeks.
   
 "The captain said, 'There's no way I'm going to sit around here for 14 days,' " Remly said. "[We] went north to Santiago."
   
 In Santiago, the ship was able to obtain fuel and food even though passengers weren't allowed to leave.
   
 On about March 26, the captain announced that about 200 crew and passengers were ill. On March 27, he informed passengers that four people had died, two of them from COVID-19.
   
 "We all knew it was serious, but when people die, the whole issue becomes ratcheted up," Remly said. "For me, all of a sudden, I thought, 'For heaven's sake, I could die.' "
   
 A veteran of many cruises, Remly said she prefers an inside cabin, which she had on the Zaandam. This time, with a quarantine on the ship, it became a liability.
   
 "Being in a cabin with no window or anything is a little tough," she said.
   
 On March 28, the Rotterdam, a larger Holland America vessel, rendezvoused with the Zaandam off the coast of Panama.
   
 "The idea was to take the healthy people on to the Rotterdam," Remly said.
   
 The switch was made on the night of the 28th.
   
 "It was at about 10 or 11 at night when I got over there," she said.
   
 Passengers continued to arrive until about 800 people had been moved to the larger ship. The plan was for the Zaandam and Rotterdam to travel together back to the United States.
   
 The Zaandam had waited several days off the coast of Panama when a "humanitarian gesture" on the part of authorities allowed the ships to pass through the Panama Canal. But some odd restrictions were put on passengers.
   
 "We went through at midnight," Remly said. "We had to leave our curtains closed and people who had balconies couldn't go out on their balconies."
   
 The ships made their way through Caribbean waters toward Fort Lauderdale.
   
 "The captain, the day before we landed, came on the television in full uniform and announced we were going to be allowed to dock," Remly said.
   
 By the next day, Thursday, that permission had been revoked. While negotiations continued to allow passengers off the ship, they had their temperatures taken.
   
 "If your temperature was normal," she said, "they gave you a white card that said 'permission to disembark.' "
   
 Finally, on Friday about 9 a.m., Remly and her fellow passengers were allowed to leave the Rotterdam. News reports indicate that 26 sick passengers remained on board to be treated.
   
 "I was out of there like a bat…" she said.
   
 A police escort that Remly estimates at 30 to 40 motorcycle units followed the buses of passengers to the airport.
   
 A chartered flight took Remly to the Atlanta airport. From there, she took a commercial flight home.
   
 She finally made it back Friday night to her Boston Heights home, where she is in self quarantine.
   
 Remly is retired from a career that included stints as a professor and lawyer, but she stays busy as president of the Friends of the Hudson Library and Historical Society. She's looking forward to getting back to running the library's book sale four days a week.
   
 Remly said she's still tired from the stress of the "cruise from hell," but is content to be resting at home with her three cats.
   
 "When you are sitting alone in a room … you think a lot," she said. "You start to realize the only thing that matters is that your friends and family are safe."

In an effort to make sure no child falls through the cracks during the COVID-19 outbreak, Akron Public Schools is launching a network of trained staff to reach out to individual students and their families.
   
 The district will train staff members who would normally be based at school -- including nutrition workers, educational assistants or IT staff -- to become "connectors," whom teachers can rely on to help bring students who are struggling at home back into the fold.
   
 At least 900 students who have yet to sign into their online learning platform can expect a call in the next week, Assistant Superintendent Ellen McWilliams- Woods said. Principals and teachers will be able to ask a connector to reach out to any other student they believe needs a firmer point of contact with their school.
   
 Their primary role will be to link families to any resources they may need, and secondarily to help students keep up with their school work, McWilliams- Woods said.
   
 Right now, in-person school is out until at least May 1, but a handful of other states have already canceled classes for the rest of the year.
   
 Because of the extensive length of time away, Akron is pushing forward with learning even while students are sequestered at home. The bigger challenge becomes how to do that in a way that doesn't further exacerbate achievement gaps.
   
 The fear, in Akron and across the country, is that the students who have resources at home like WiFi, easy access to food and parents home with them during the day, will be the ones who thrive with online learning, and those who lack one or all of those will continue to be left behind.
   
 "Our students who already have a higher percentage of barriers to learning, we cannot let them lose ground during this time period," McWilliams-Woods said.
   
 At the same time, she said, Akron was likely far ahead of the curve of other districts with a high concentration of students who live in poverty. The district started seven years ago moving to a digital curriculum, and every student now has a Chromebook laptop to take home with them. Some students who didn't take theirs home before school closed mid-March had theirs delivered to their homes.
   
 The online learning platform tracks students' activity, and so far, 95% of the district's 21,000 students have logged in at some point in the last three weeks. By the end of each day last week, about 60% to 70% of students had logged in at some point that day. All students have been marked present for the last three weeks, McWilliams-Woods said, but she expects the state will issue new guidance this week about how to proceed with taking attendance the rest of this month.
   
 About 75% of students in the district have reliable WiFi at home, according to surveys that are a few years old, McWilliams-Woods said. The district has encouraged families to drive to parking lots of schools, libraries or even McDonald's to access free WiFi while still practicing social distancing. The school board also approved a purchase two weeks ago of 500 WiFi hot-spot devices to distribute to students as needed.
   
 Some students, she said, have notified their teachers they were using cell phone hot-spots to conduct their work, and their data plans were running low.
   
 Teachers have been instructed to be as flexible as possible during this time, she said. Work is still being graded, but is due on a weekly, not daily, basis.
   
 "We've asked teachers to be obviously hugely sensitive to everything that's going on in a family's lives," she said.
   
 Carla Chapman, the district's director of community relations, said the staff that will act as "connectors" can help families get setup with WiFi or access resources through the United Way, including food and housing.
   
 "We just want to know that people are OK," Chapman said.
   
 Many of those who will be connectors are staff who already have relationships with students in the building, but they may be calling students they don't know as well, depending on the need.
   
 "We knew that there were people in schools who are not instructional but still have those relationships with students and families who could really play a role in supporting teachers in connecting with their students," Chapman said.
   
 Schools that have family liaisons on staff have already deployed those staff members to start making calls to families.
   
 Parents in need can also reach out to the district's family engagement center directly at 330-761-2810.

Zenei középiskolába járt, majd öt éven át postásként dolgozott, miközben néha esténként chicagói klubokban lépett fel. Legismertebb korai dalait ezekben az időkben írta, mint később felidézte, a számok a fejében születtek meg, kézbesítés közben. A vietnámi háború idején Németországban teljesített katonai szolgálatot, hazatérését követően az egyik kiemelkedő alakja lett Chicagóban a megújuló folk színtérnek. Aztán egy klubban Kris Kristofferson énekes-színész kiszúrta magának, és Prine-nal hamarosan szerződést kötött az Atlantic Records, amely első lemezét 1971-ben jelentette meg. Ez, a John Prine című album komoly dicséretet kapott a kritikusoktól, az anyagon számos olyan dal szerepelt, amely később repertoárja alappillérévé vált: az Angel from Montgomery, a Paradise és a Sam Stone, utóbbi egy kábítószerfüggő vietnámi veterán leépüléséről szól. Ezeket a dalokat később számos előadó feldolgozta. John Prine-t Bob Dylan is az egyik kedvencének nevezte. Ahogy egy több mint tíz évvel ezelőtti interjúban fogalmazott, „Prine maga a tiszta prousti egzisztencializmus. Középnyugati lelki utazások az n-ediken. És gyönyörű dalokat ír”. A hetvenes években számos további lemeze jelent meg, közönsége szélesedett, zenei skálája a folktól a country-n át az americanáig terjedt, sok-sok humorral vegyítve. A nyolcvanas években saját lemezkiadót alapított Oh Boy Records néven, albumai aztán már itt jelentek meg. Első Grammy-díját 1991-ben kapta The Missing Years című lemezéért, majd 2005-ben ismét díjazták a Fair and Square című albumáért.

 Selon le quotidien flamand _Het Nieuwsblad_ , Peter Van Petegem, qui organise le GP Impanis prévu le 19 septembre prochain, a confirmé que des discussions avaient déjà eu lieu avec ses collègues du Tour des Flandres pour qu'il leur « offre » sa place au calendrier. L'ancien double vainqueur du Ronde (1999 et 2003), serait prêt à sacrifier son épreuve cette année pour sauver le monument flamand au nom de l'intérêt national.
 Tomas Van den Spiegel le patron de Flanders Classics (consortium qui organise le Tour des Flandres) a admis que les négociations avec le GP Impanis avaient bel et bien eu lieu mais a tenu à freiner tout excès d'enthousiasme auprès du public belge.
 _«  La décision concernant une nouvelle date revient à l'UCI et non à nous,_ a-t-il affirmé. _Nous avons parlé avec le GP Impanis pour être sûr qu'une solution pouvait exister. Mais ce n'est pas encore un Plan B, c'est l'UCI qui doit définir le nouveau calendrier. Nous ne voulons pas faire cavalier seul._ »
