Last year, former United States Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Mr Johnnie Carson spoke highly of electoral and media reforms which President Mnangagwa's administration has undertaken since the July 2018 harmonised elections, saying Harare was on course to implementing recommendations made by poll observer missions.

Funaba said that "his act has caused the victim a tremendous emotional distress and physical harm."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Inai was known for appearing on TV quiz shows. In 2014, he participated in the university's beauty contest and was one of the five finalists introduced online. He also enjoyed popularity on social media.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The ruling in Inai's case comes amid Japan's late-blooming #MeToo movement and growing calls for an overhaul of the nation's rape laws, which critics say fail to protect victims of sexual violence and let abusers walk free.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    In 2017, the first significant review of sexual offenses since the establishment of the Penal Code in 1907 expanded the acts that constitute rape to include anal and oral sex, recognized that men are potential rape victims and raised minimum sentences from three years up to five.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    However, Funaba said he handed down the suspended sentence as an out-of-court settlement has been reached in which Inai agreed to pay the woman ¥7.5 million in compensation. The settlement also obliges his parents to supervise him.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Funaba cited the fact that Inai had no prior criminal conviction as another mitigating factor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The judge also noted Inai was intoxicated on the day of the crime.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    "During the trial, the defendant admitted to the charges and has shown remorse," Funaba said.

The closest comparison to the Wuhan coronavirus is the SARS epidemic of 2003, which also originated in China. SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, is believed to be an animal virus that was transmitted to humans mainly through civet cats, a Chinese delicacy sold to restaurants at exotic animal markets in southern China.          The lesson from SARS is that quick, coordinated action by governments and health officials is critical. China failed that test at the outset of SARS. The Communist government’s initial instinct was to cover-up news of the illness, which aided the spread. Eventually, China got serious in the way authoritarian governments easily can: It ordered lockdowns of villages to help eradicate the virus. Overall SARS infected about 8,000 people worldwide, killing about 775.          Maybe China will be able to stanch the spread. But as experts warn, Wuhan coronavirus is already on the run internationally. Health officials will need to stay alert.

Fourth, the evidence was crystal clear that people are not at all accurate in self-evaluating their time management proficiency. For example, less than 1% of people’s self-ratings overlapped with their objective skill scores. Moreover, self-ratings only accounted for about 2% of differences in actual time management skills. These results echo previous work on people’s lack of accurate self-awareness regarding their competencies and how this impedes change and leadership development.

Hazardous chemicals are present in close proximity in different social orders and could represent a risk if not taken care of precisely. The worldwide hazardous chemicals packaging market is backed by packaging innovation to ensure effective transport of chemical items. Producers of chemicals packaging work to provide different solutions for hazardous chemicals, for example, drums, IBCs, canisters and so forth. Hazardous chemical packaging eliminates harm and increases the time span of usability of the items stored during transportation. Besides, hazardous chemical packaging arrangements offer increased security to the items. The danger of spillage, blast and consumption is greatly diminished. As a result of this, the demand for rotomolded containers is quite high in the chemicals packaging industry owing to its significant properties and its resistance to any unwanted transportation hazards. The sturdiness of rotomolded containers is expected to bode well for the global market in the long run.

Jacks, like tuna, are open-water fish. They are relentless predators and find their food mostly by sight and sound rather than smell. Knowing this behavior pattern offers you some clues in how to target them. While a dead bait sitting on the bottom might catch a jack very occasionally, you’ll do a lot better with something that is swimming near the surface or at midwater.          For those of you who prefer to fish the low-key way (casting bait off the dock, then retreating to the pool cage to lounge around and watch the rod), these are going to be tricky fish to catch. First, you need to hang your bait under a float. Live baitfish are better, but shrimp will work too. But a bait under a float — well, it floats. It might drift out to the middle of the channel and become an obstruction to boats coming through. Or it might end up against the seawall. Neither is good.          And then, if a jack eats your bait, you might not have anything to do by the time you get to the rod. Did I mention how fast they are? In the 30 seconds it takes you to push off the chair, scramble over the door and make your way to the dock, there may be no line left on your reel. Set your drag tight enough to solve that problem and the fish might just break your rod instead. Stay out on the dock, where you can react right away.          Since they love to chase their food down, artificial lures are very attractive to jacks. Casting them from your dock might work. If you see them cruising down the canal (they kinda look like a pack of miniature submarines pushing wakes, usually right in the middle), toss a lure at them and they’ll usually whack it. Hard plastic jerkbaits and poppers work very well.          If you think there might be jacks around, you can sometimes attract them with noise. Put your rodtip in the water and start making figure-8s. Don’t be subtle about it, either. The idea is to simulate the sound of predators crashing bait at the surface of the water. When jacks hear it, they will often come running to investigate. Be ready to put something in front of their faces.

As Honda's current offering in the quarter-litre sports class is the very long in the tooth CBR250R, it is perhaps time for a major model update. However, we were informed by Boon Siew Honda the primary reason the CBR250RR is not brought in is because of Euro conformance - Malaysia follows the Euro standard closely for emissions - and price, which, compared against its local market competition, would be somewhat prohibitive.

Liverpool make it look easy and the Premier League table suggests it has been as they are now a staggering 19 points ahead of the rest.
 Incredibly, Liverpool have beaten every team in the Premier League already this season which is the first time in the club’s illustrious history as they set new records every week.
 It has long since been a question of when rather than if Liverpool win the title and on nights like these they look on a different level to every other team.
 In fairness to West Ham, they at least put up a fight and David Moyes has added some steel and organisation but it was still a mismatch even if Liverpool were not at their very best.
 West Ham refused to fold. Declan Rice’s shot was beaten away by Alisson and then Trent Alexander-Arnold crashed the ball against his own post as he tried to put it out for a corner.
 Salah did strike the woodwork late on but Liverpool could afford to take their foot off the gas, ease up and conserve energy for Southampton on Saturday.

"Today's highlight will be the Bank of England's (BoE) monetary policy announcement at 13:00 CET. Despite a few economic data releases that came out stronger than expected, we still expect the BoE to cut the Bank Rate by 25bp, a view we have held since November. Despite slightly stronger data, the economy remains weak overall due to high uncertainty on Brexit. However, it is likely to be a close call, which is also reflected in market pricing, as investors are pricing a 45% probability of a cut, leaving some upside in EUR/GBP if we are right in our call."

Xisco Hernandez and Vinit Rai started to get more on the ball and they should have had a goal back before half-time when Manuel Onwu's goal after a clever Odisha move was unjustly ruled out for offside.

Trump faces charges from the House that he abused his power like no other president, jeopardizing Ukraine and U.S.-Ukraine relations by using the military aid as leverage while the vulnerable ally battled Russia. The second article of impeachment says Trump then obstructed the House probe in a way that threatened the nation's three-branch system of checks and balances.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Over two days, senators are grilling the House Democrats prosecuting the case and the Republican president's defense team. Dozens of questions were asked and answered Wednesday in five-minute clips, with senators under orders to sit silently without comment, submitting their questions in writing. They finished shortly past 11 p.m. and were expected to keep going Thursday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Democratic leader Chuck Schumer asked whether the Senate could really render a fair verdict without hearing from Bolton or acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, both potential eyewitnesses to Trump's actions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    “Don’t wait for the book. Don’t wait ’til March 17, when it is in black and white to find out the answer to your question,” Schiff told the Senate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    That publication date is now in doubt. The White House on Wednesday released a letter to Bolton's attorney objecting to “significant amounts of classified information" in the manuscript, including at the top secret level. Bolton and his attorney have insisted the book does not contain any classified information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The White House action could delay the book's publication if Bolton, who resigned last September — Trump says he was fired — is forced to revise his draft.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    GOP senators are straining to balance the new revelations with pressure for quick acquittal. They have been sternly warned by party leaders that calling Bolton as a witness could entangle the trial in lengthy legal battles and delay Trump's expected acquittal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    White House lawyers made exactly that point. Attorney Pat Philbin said in response to the Democrats' first question, “This institution will effectively be paralyzed for months.” That was echoed by others.

Meanwhile, planning permission has been granted for 14 huts in a birch wood near Lanark where a Roman camp once stood.          Louise Witter, from Aberdeen, bought the 32-acre plot two years ago, partly as an investment and partly as place where an environmentally friendly project could take root.

MANILA, Philippines -- Inflation likely eased in January on the back of lower global oil prices, UnionBank's Economic Research Unit said Thursday.

To mark the 50th anniversary of the video that started it all, NFL Films is running a feature this week in which current coaches sit down and offer their own commentary while watching Stram at work. It's a tribute to the coach, and also a reminder of how boldly his stamp is still imprinted on the game a half-century later.

I believe that it won't be industries or sectors that pivot versus die, but individual companies. Some organizations, like Nestle, Unilever, and P&G, are taking these issues seriously and making the difficult decisions that may negatively impact the short term but lay the foundation to be relevant in the long term. Inversely, organizations -- like many big food companies in the U.S. -- are blind to what's coming and will likely be overtaken by startups that are building their business models around the new reality that is emerging.

“I make them all,” she said. “It gives them a little safe place to call their own, and when parents bring a T-Shirt or whatever, we pop the T-shirt on the mat or in the ball and they feel even more safe.”                  With a background in retail, McGhee thought of the idea for the boarding facility two years ago while on a trip to the East Coast.                   “Before I left I went to board my cats and the place was almost full in January,” she said. “I was back east and thought about it all the way home and really started crunching the numbers and what it would take to put this together.”                  McGhee opened up Cats Play While You’re Away in July 2019 in an old office space in Vancouver.                   “I did all the drywall myself,” she said, pointing to the first set of cat apartments in the building.                   Each of the 25 apartments is 4-by-7-feet with a few rooms that have the ability to expand to 15 feet in length.                   “These ones are able to open up or close off depending on what the needs of the cat are,” McGhee said while pointing out the apartments in the front of the building.                   Along with giving the cats their own space to make a home away from home, McGhee lets the cats get out and explore the building every once in a while to burn energy. With climbing ramps, perches and scratching posts all over, furry felines have opportunities to play and relax.                   “I kind of have a kitty spa,” she said, explaining how she will trim the cats’ nails and put on nail caps if the owner prefers.                   While a pampering spa might not be for every cat, each feline gets daily attention and visits from McGhee to make the new space more inviting for the cats.                   Along with this, McGhee said the paint in the building is a “fear-free color scheme” to ease the nerves of cats.                   “Cats see colors in threatening and non-threatening” she said. “This lavender color is non-threatening to them.”                   To keep the “fear-free” environment, McGhee solely focuses on cats and keeps the environment dog-free.

A Japanese billionaire who launched a public search for a girlfriend willing to join him on a trip into space abruptly cancelled the hunt on Thursday, despite attracting nearly 30,000 applicants.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Yusaku Maezawa earlier this month said he was looking for a mate willing to join him when he heads on a trip around the Moon in 2023 or later, as the first private passenger on a voyage offered by Elon Musk's SpaceX.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          His search for a soulmate was due to be turned into a TV show for a web-streaming service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          But on Thursday Maezawa dashed the hopes of thousands, citing "personal reasons."

Adoption of digitization in the maritime industry is increasing rapidly. The major reason for the adoption is increased productivity, value addition, and minimizing the risk of human errors as well as accidents. Operation cost can drastically be reduced in the long run with the adoption of automation in port terminals. The benefits of adopting automation in port terminals with reduced cost is driving the demand for automated port terminals.

Hells Gate State Park employees are working to deepen the mooring area and to address a shallow spot in the entrance to the marina from the Snake River.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Park manager Charlie Chase said the dredging crew is making good progress on some of the worst spots in the part of the marina in which boat owners store their vessels in slips. Water depths at the marina shrink to as little as 1½ feet in the late summer months. That makes it difficult for most vessels, and impossible for some of the larger boats, to enter and exit the moorage area.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    A portion of the entrance to the marina from the Snake River also becomes shallow during summer months. Chase said there is a hump where depths get as shallow as about 1½ feet. That area is set to be addressed in the dredging.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    “We will take that hump out of there,” he said. “It doesn’t go all the way across the marina entrance, but it is a hump that is about a foot and a half deep.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    When the work is done, Chase said the marina should be 5 feet deep at times when Lower Granite Reservoir is at its lowest elevation. That generally happens in the summer, as Snake River flows drop and the Army Corps of Engineers lowers the reservoir level to aid migrating juvenile salmon.

The answer was a bit yes and no. The Hoosiers scored 21 second-half points, which set the bar fairly low for a off-and-on Penn State shooting. Lamar Stevens, battling a cold, scored 17 despite a horrific night from the line that included an air-balled free throw. Curtis Jones Jr was effective for the second-straight game with 12 points on 5-of-9 shooting.

The annexation proposal will be on the ballots of voters in both jurisdictions during the February 11 special election. It must pass in both the city and the fire district to take effect.           The Strategic Plan was developed over the course of a 12-month period. Residents of Fire District 3 and its emergency personnel contributed to the plan before it was submitted to the Board of Fire Commissioners for consideration. The Strategic Plan and information about the annexation proposal can be found on the Fire District's website at fire3.org. City residents are encouraged to visit Battle Ground's website for annexation information: cityofbg.org/FireAnnexation.           _— Fire District 3_

Trump faces charges from the House that he abused his power like no other president, jeopardizing Ukraine and U.S.-Ukraine relations by using the military aid as leverage while the vulnerable ally battled Russia. The second article of impeachment says Trump then obstructed the House probe in a way that threatened the nation's three-branch system of checks and balances.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Over two days, senators are grilling the House Democrats prosecuting the case and the Republican president's defense team. Dozens of questions were asked and answered Wednesday in five-minute clips, with senators under orders to sit silently without comment, submitting their questions in writing. They finished shortly past 11 p.m. and were expected to keep going Thursday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Democratic leader Chuck Schumer asked whether the Senate could really render a fair verdict without hearing from Bolton or acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, both potential eyewitnesses to Trump's actions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            “Don’t wait for the book. Don’t wait ’til March 17, when it is in black and white to find out the answer to your question,” Schiff told the Senate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            That publication date is now in doubt. The White House on Wednesday released a letter to Bolton's attorney objecting to “significant amounts of classified information" in the manuscript, including at the top secret level. Bolton and his attorney have insisted the book does not contain any classified information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The White House action could delay the book's publication if Bolton, who resigned last September — Trump says he was fired — is forced to revise his draft.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            GOP senators are straining to balance the new revelations with pressure for quick acquittal. They have been sternly warned by party leaders that calling Bolton as a witness could entangle the trial in lengthy legal battles and delay Trump's expected acquittal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            White House lawyers made exactly that point. Attorney Pat Philbin said in response to the Democrats' first question, “This institution will effectively be paralyzed for months.” That was echoed by others.

FC Goa have a tendency to switch on and off during phases. When they turn it on, the Gaurs are devastating in attack and they tend to score in clumps. Just like they did against Odisha.

Absolucion. Es la decision de la Seccion Segunda de la Audiencia Provincial de Castellon en el caso de una mujer de origen marroqui, acusada de captar a una compatriota para explotarla sexualmente en Castello. Aunque la Fiscalia pedia seis años de carcel y 12.000 euros de indemnizacion y hablaba de trata de personas, el tribunal no ha declarado probado que se diese tal delito.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Los magistrados consideran acreditado que las dos mujeres se pusieron en contacto a traves de una conocida y que la victima acabo viajando a Castello, donde la procesada la acogio en su propia casa. Transcurrido un tiempo, la supuesta victima pregunto a la investigada cuando buscarian un trabajo para ella. La mujer ahora absuelta respondio que el desconocimiento del idioma dificultaba su acceso al mundo laboral y sugirio que la denunciante «podia dedicarse a la prostitucion en la vivienda, como hacia ella misma sin que el arrendatario del piso lo supiese». El mismo tribunal declara probado que la supuesta victima se nego y que esa postura «enfado a la acusada, quien le dijo a la mujer que se marchara del piso y se fue, enfurecida».                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Los magistrados consideran tambien acreditado que cuando la investigada volvio al piso y vio a la denunciante todavia en la casa, la cogio por el cuello y el pelo, le dio un estiron e hizo que se golpeara con una mesa.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Por ese delito leve de lesiones la Audiencia Provincial si condena a la mujer procesada a abonar una multa de 744 euros y le impone una orden de alejamiento por la que no podra acercarse a menos de 500 metros de la afectada por tiempo de seis meses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    La victima fue entonces a denunciar lo ocurrido ante la Policia Nacional. La sentencia del tribunal castellonense recoge, asimismo, que dias despues, fue abordada por la calle por un hombre desconocido, quien la amenazo de muerte si no retiraba la denuncia, la agarro del brazo y le dio un cabezazo en la frente, causandole un hematoma.

The Razorbacks tied the game only once when Jones' driving lay-up and subsequent free throw knotted it at 40-all with about 19 minutes left. South Carolina made five of its next six from the floor and rebuilt its lead to nine.

Most politicians consider the next five days the most important of the General Election campaign. Come Monday morning, most people who are going to vote will have decided where they are Today also happens to be the last full day of the 28 member-state European Union. Brace yourself for displays of Union Jack-draped nationalist ignominy from our nearest neighbours. But save your tears, and/or embarrassment, for they will not be shedding any for us. Team 27 will hold their heads high and struggle on regardless as the UK flirts with other trading blocks in search of new-found relationships. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has gone to the ends of the Earth to remind voters that Fine Gael has been involved in Brexit negotiations to date. The day after he called the election, Varadkar was posing alongside European Council President Ursula von der Leyen on the steps of Government Buildings as she praised him for his effort on Brexit, and on Monday EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier was lauding the Taoiseach for the courage he has shown during the negotiations. Yesterday, EU Trade Commissioner Phil Hogan was warning people of the dangers of the forthcoming Brexit trade negotiations. Hogan helpfully noted election manifesto predictions might have been very different if his former colleagues in Fine Gael had not secured a deal with those awkward Tories. Coincidentally or not, all the stars are aligning for Fine Gael on its Brexit strategy. Most likely not coincidentally, though. But is anyone listening? Fine Gael hopes voters are becoming petrified of the idea of future trade relations being negotiated by Micheál Martin and his team of inexperienced TDs. On that point, has anyone ever heard Fianna Fáil foreign affairs spokesperson Seán Haughey give his views on the next stage of Brexit negotiations, or even speak? Perhaps some day we will. If only Fianna Fáil would give him a chance. However, Martin won't be distracted by the Brexit noise and will focus on his message of change - if your idea of change is to the party that propped up the Government for the last four years. But the real fear among both parties is the possibility of Sinn Féin breaking into establishment politics. Sinn Féin's rise mostly eats into Fianna Fáil's vote, but also chips away at Fine Gael's plan to appeal to young voters. Fine Gael is waiting to see the results of the next opinion poll. Some believe it could show a three-horse race with all three parties on the mid to low 20s. If that's the case, it would be hard to deny Mary Lou McDonald a spot on the last RTÉ leadership debate. And it makes the possibility of a grand coalition between Fine Gael and Fianna Fail all the more likely if the votes fall the same way on February 8.

The Lamborghini Huracan Evo has received critical acclaim thanks to its explosive engine, high G-force inducing handling and relatively accessible price tag. If there was one complaint (from a very few people), it was how the clever AWD system, aerodynamics, steering system and traction control made the sportscar more of a straight-line monster than a corner carver. Lamborghini has addressed this concern with the Huracan Evo RWD, with a promise that it is ‘emotive and engaging’. Here’s a quick look at it in pictures.The Lamborghini Huracan Evo has been launched in India only a few weeks after its international launch. Base price starts at Rs 3.22 crore, ex-showroom India.You can tell the Huracan Evo RWD apart from its AWD brethren due to subtle design changes made at the front and rear.The front bumper features a less aggressive splitter and larger air intakes for better cooling of the engine and brakes.At the back, the diffuser design has been changed for better downforce, which should help the rear-wheel drive setup be more effective at all speeds.Also note the new 20-inch 10-spoke shiny black alloy wheels. Lamborghini Ad Personam program allows for infinite ways to customise the Huracan Evo RWD if one wishes to.Sitting under the rear windshield is the same 5.2-litre, naturally aspirated V10 engine but detuned to develop 602bhp and 560Nm.In spite of being down on power, the Huracan Evo RWD is 33kg lighter, has improved steering feedback, improved aerodynamics for better downforce and a modified traction control system which allows more drifts.All these combine for more fun!Adding lightness has not been done by removing anything from the rocketship looking interior, thankfully.What next? A Spyder (convertible) variant of the RWD seems to be on the cards. Going sideways in a 600+bhp open-top sportscar sure sounds like fun!

Each year, 88,000 Americans die from alcohol-related causes, making alcohol the third leading preventable cause of death in the United States, behind tobacco and poor diet/physical inactivity.          The number of deaths from alcohol is rising despite our improving understanding and acceptance of addiction. We know more about alcohol screening and treatment than ever before, but only 20% of those in need receive any form of treatment, and fewer than 10% get prescribed medications.          I think the reason for this is that they are waiting for a rock bottom. It provides another reason for people to delay treatment if they feel they haven’t hit that low. So many at-risk drinkers could use help and won’t get it because they haven’t yet crashed. It would be hard to imagine a scenario in which insulin is withheld until a diabetic’s vision loss is imminent, or anti-hypertensives denied until several strokes occurred.          As a clinician, my message to patients, families, friends and fellow clinicians is a simple one: Waiting kills. Alcohol is the most common problem encountered by primary care providers, yet the one they are least able to manage before their patients hit a crisis point.          The rock bottom myth convinces drinkers that they must become a form of irredeemable to get help. Suggesting that the only way to get better is to get worse doesn’t make sense in many ways. Moreover, a message tinged with that hopelessness has a lasting effect on our collective psyches.

Far from voiding the last election, Schiff said, impeachment is protecting the next one, in 2020, from any future Trump efforts to ask foreign governments to intervene.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Republicans tried to engage the president's defense, at times raising the profile of the still anonymous government whistleblower whose complaint about Trump's July 25 call with Ukraine sparked the impeachment inquiry. Democrats kept focus on the case for Trump's conviction and removal, which would require 67 votes in the Senate and seems unlikely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            At times, there were telling exchanges.

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jason Petrie said Wednesday that bills to be considered will likely deal with the bail system, persistent felony offender status, felony thresholds for theft offenses, and probation. The upcoming discussions come amid surging incarceration rates in Kentucky. Gov. Andy Beshear points to rising prison costs as a growing burden on the state budget, sapping money for education and health care. He has urged lawmakers to take up criminal-justice reform.KENTUCKY-ABORTION LAWFederal court hears Kentucky abortion procedure law appealLOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Kentucky officials are asking a federal appeals court to restore a state law that bans a common second trimester abortion procedure. The law passed in 2018 was struck down last year by a federal judge. But a lawyer from the Kentucky Attorney General's office told the Sixth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Wednesday that the law simply changes how the abortion must be performed by requiring an alternative procedure. The law was challenged by the lone clinic performing abortions in Kentucky. An attorney representing the clinic argued the law could force women to leave the state to seek an abortion.VOTING RIGHTS-KENTUCKYLawmaker promotes measure to restore felon voting rightsFRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) — A House Democrat is pushing for a constitutional measure in Kentucky to automatically restore voting rights for felons who complete their sentences. The proposed constitutional amendment would be a permanent and broader follow-up to an executive order previously signed by Gov. Andy Beshear. That order restored voting rights for more than 140,000 nonviolent offenders who completed their sentences. Rep. Charles Booker on Wednesday praised the governor's action but said there's more “work to do." He says executive orders can be rescinded. His proposal would automatically restore felon voting rights after completion of a prison sentence, probation or parole.BC-US-PHONY SCHOOL-IMMIGRATIONKentucky man sentenced in phony school immigration schemeDETROIT (AP) — A 36-year-old man will spend six months in prison for his role in recruiting dozens of foreign-born students to attend a phony school in suburban Detroit so they could remain in the U.S. The Detroit News reports that Phanideep Karnati was sentenced Wednesday in federal court. Authorities say Karnati recruited 74 people to enroll in The University of Farmington which was created by the Department of Homeland Security. Its offices were in Farmington Hills but there were no classes or teachers. Recruiters were paid to help foreigners maintain their status as "students" and get work permits. Karnati is a native of India and lived in Louisville, Kentucky. Seven other recruiters have been sentenced in the scheme.FORT CAMPBELL-MALPRACTICE SUITTeen wins $15M judgment against Fort Campbell hospitalNASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — A federal judge in Tennessee has awarded a $15 million judgment to a teen who suffered a brain injury at a hospital on the Fort Campbell Army post. The parents of the boy filed a medical malpractice lawsuit in 2015. They alleged their son suffered injuries during his birth at Blanchfield Army Community Hospital at Fort Campbell in 2005. A federal judge found that the hospital failed to inform the mother, Kelly Wilson, of her choices of delivery and didn't properly monitor the fetus during labor. He suffers from cerebral palsy and other neurological deficiencies.LEGISLATION-TRANSGENDER COMMUNITYDemocrat seeks to fight Kentucky GOP transgender billsFRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) — Republican lawmakers in Kentucky are sponsoring three bills affecting the transgender community. News outlets report Democrat candidate Ramona Thomas plans to fight the legislation if elected to the statehouse. Thomas began transitioning in 2017. She believes the bills are a result of a lack of LGBT people in state government. One bill would prohibit students from using public restrooms that don't align with their “biological gender.” Another would make it a felony for doctors to provide gender-altering medications to minors. The third would require students to play sports based on the sex listed on their birth certificate.

Seeing Dom and Letty at peace, well away from the city with Dom's son, no doubt also considered Letty's son at this point, is an interesting development in the Fast and Furious franchise since it's about as close as we've ever seen any of the characters being so completely removed from the life they were used to in the previous movies. It's true that we did get to see Brian and Mia living the good life on a beach well away from anyone, but if there's anything that's been proven in these movies, it's that one way or another the life is going to keep calling to the team and it will bring them back together one way or another since there's always another job to be done even if it's meant to be the last one. It does feel as though this movie might be happening at the same time as Hobbs and Shaw's escapade which could be a perfect explanation of why they couldn't join up for this next adventure, and it's also easy to think why Owen Shaw, played by Luke Evans, wouldn't be invited since there might still be hard feelings there, but it does appear that some of the new faces might be in response to the crew getting back together. That could be a leap of logic that doesn't make as much sense as it did in my head, but given that the Fast and Furious franchise has made several such leaps throughout the years it's still something to consider. Lauren Coates of Screenrant has more to offer on this line of discussion.

Oher sporting events in China have also been affected by the crisis.          The men's alpine skiing World Cup races in China, scheduled for 15 and 16 February in Yanqing, have been cancelled.          The 2020 World Athletics Indoor Championships, due to be held from 13-15 March in Nanjing, have been pushed back 12 months after World Athletics sought advice from the World Health Organisation.          Formula 1 says it is "monitoring" the effects of the outbreak in China in the context of the country's Grand Prix in Shanghai from 17-19 April.          The all-electric Formula E series is also due to hold a race in Sanya, southern China, on 21 March and Formula E says it is also "closely monitoring" the situation in tandem with local authorities.          In a statement, the China Football Association said their move to postpone the "2020 season national football competitions at all levels" was taken to help with the "prevention and control of the pneumonia epidemic of the new coronavirus infection, and to protect the health of the majority of fans, media, players, coaches, game officials, clubs and district staff".

Xisco Hernandez and Vinit Rai started to get more on the ball and they should have had a goal back before half-time when Manuel Onwu's goal after a clever Odisha move was unjustly ruled out for offside.

Schiff’s response to Dershowitz focused on one particular senator: He asked his audience to imagine what would have happened if then-President Barack Obama asked the Russians to dig up dirt on then-candidate Romney, the GOP’s 2012 presidential nominee?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Romney, standing at the back of the chamber, smiled occasionally at mention of his name.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Far from voiding the last election, Schiff said, impeachment is protecting the next one, in 2020, from any future Trump efforts to ask foreign governments to intervene.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Republicans tried to engage the president's defense, at times raising the profile of the still anonymous government whistleblower whose complaint about Trump's July 25 call with Ukraine sparked the impeachment inquiry. Democrats kept focus on the case for Trump's conviction and removal, which would require 67 votes in the Senate and seems unlikely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    At times, there were telling exchanges. In one, the White House team could not fully respond when Collins and Murkowski asked if Trump had ever pursued Biden investigations before the former vice president announced his presidential bid in 2019.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Philbin argued that relying on foreign information in a U.S. campaign isn't necessarily a campaign law violation, drawing objections later from Democrats. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., who said he was “flabbergasted.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    In another, Dershowitz acknowledged he has changed his thinking on what the Founders intended with impeachment and keeps “refining” his views.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    As the long night drew to a close, so did Schiff's remarks, warning senators they were lowering the bar for Trump, dressing it up with legalese.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    “Corruption is still corruption,” he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    One person watching from the sidelines Wednesday was Lev Parnas, the indicted associate of Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani. Parnas arrived at the Capitol but could not enter the Senate with his court-ordered electronic-tracking device. He has turned over evidence for the investigation, and said he wants to testify.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ___                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     _Associated Press writers Alan Fram, Andrew Taylor, Matthew Daly, Laurie Kellman and Padmananda Rama contributed to this report._

The rock bottom I've been talking about may have not even happened yet. The absolute worst case in my mind is Jack Eichel requesting a trade due to his frustration of playing on these awful teams for so long. He's in his 5th year and the team has topped out at 81 points in that span with no signs of improvement.

ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- A plane evacuating 201 Americans from the Chinese city at the center of the virus outbreak continued Wednesday on to Southern California after everyone aboard passed a health screening test in Anchorage, where the aircraft had stopped to refuel.           All the passengers had already been through two screenings in China and were screened twice more in Anchorage by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. One passenger received medical attention for a minor injury that happened before boarding the airplane in China, Dr. Anne Zink, Alaska's chief medical officer, told an early morning news conference after the plane left.           The U.S. government chartered the plane to fly out diplomats from the U.S. Consulate in Wuhan, where the latest coronavirus outbreak started, and other Americans. The plane landed Tuesday night in Anchorage. The Americans will undergo additional health screenings in California and will be temporarily housed there for a period of time as they finish the repatriation process, officials said.           "For many of us directly involved in this, it's become a moving and uplifting experience. The whole plane erupted into cheers when the crew welcomed them back to the United States," Zink said.           "This is the best possible outcome," s tate health commissioner Adam Crum said in a release. "We wish these passengers the best of luck as they complete their journeys home and I am deeply grateful to everyone who came together to assist us in helping with this repatriation effort."           The state had initially said the plane could carry up to 240 passengers, and Zink said they were prepared for that number. "At the end of the day, 201 passengers loaded and 201 passengers left Alaska," she said.           The flight crew remained on the upper level of the plane, entirely isolated from the )passengers for the entirety of the flight and did not get off the plane in China, putting them at low risk, she said.           The plane is now scheduled to land at March Air Reserve Base in California's Riverside County, instead of the original plan to go to Ontario International Airport in neighboring San Bernardino County.           Curt Hagman, an Ontario airport commissioner, said the Centers for Disease Control announced the diversion.           "We were prepared but the State Department decided to switch the flight" to the airbase, Hagman said.           Officials at the Ontario airport 35 miles (56 kilometers) east of Los Angeles had been readying facilities to receive and screen the repatriates and temporarily house them for up to two weeks -- if the CDC determined that is necessary, said David Wert, spokesman for the county of San Bernardino.           Ontario International Airport was designated about a decade ago by the U.S. government to receive repatriated Americans in case of an emergency overseas, but it would have been the first time the facility was used for the purpose, Wert said.            Wuhan is the epicenter of a new virus that has sickened thousands and killed more than 100 people. China has cut off access to Wuhan and 16 other cities in Hubei province to prevent people from leaving and spreading the virus further. In addition to the United States, countries including Japan and South Korea have also planned evacuations. Symptoms of the virus include fever, cough, and in more severe cases shortness of breath or pneumonia.           The Americans aboard the white cargo plane with red and gold stripes left Wuhan before dawn Wednesday, China time. They arrived in Anchorage at the mostly desolate North Terminal just after 9:30 p.m. Tuesday, local time. The jetway was extended from the end of the terminal, but it also had no windows. Passengers were not visible.           The passengers were isolated in the airport's international terminal, which lies mostly dormant in the winter months. The terminal is not connected to the larger and heavily used domestic flights terminal, and each has separate ventilation systems, said Jim Szczesniak, manager of the Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport.           "In the wintertime, we have the ability and the luxury of not having any passenger traffic over there, so it's a perfect area for us to handle this kind of flight," he said.           ___           Associated Press writer Matthew Lee in Washington contributed to this report.

If you're reading this, I have apparently died today, Tuesday, Jan. 28, 2020. I probably should have forwarded that chain letter. So I guess I have to tell my life story.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       My name was Ruth Burrous Soule. I was known by many as Ruthie, Tuke and Ma-Moo, but by those who loved me the most I was Hun, Ma and Gramma.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        I was born Oct. 8, 1946 at home in the West Branch of Galeton to Lester Burrous and Virginia Knickerbocker Burrous Johnston (both predeceased me). With 11 rambunctious, and most of the time, dangerous siblings, I barely survived my upbringing in the Notch before I was swept away and married the love of my life, Gary Soule. On July 9, 1967 we became the Sexy Soules. Together we had three kids, Garri Annette, Oct. 27, 1968, Lance Lee, Oct. 27, 1970 and Jesse Arland, Feb. 6, 1973. I will joyfully meet my parents and sons in Heaven along with three of my siblings (Ronald Burrous, John Burrous and Janet Taylor), as well as my nieces, Virginia (Dubie) Bailey and Sherry Taylor, and nephews, Aaron Gill and Jerry Taylor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I was a loving wife, comforting mom, spoiling gramma, good friend and hard worker. Through my years I worked as a waitress, factory worker and lunch lady. I was as generous as anybody ever could be. I was giving away many of my possessions in my last days. By the way, would anybody like some slightly used false teeth?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        I'm leaving behind the greatest gifts my daughter and son-in-law, Sam and Boo Bollock, ever gave me, my pork chop, Alivia and my hamburger, Nick, my favorite sisters, Marie Sutton and Faun James, my favorite brothers, Scott Burrous and Chester Burrous.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        The things I regret most are not training my dogs to detect cancer and never sending my application to the Rockettes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        So, in a nutshell, I was born, I blinked and it was over. No buildings named after me. No monuments erected in my honor. But I was more blessed than you will ever know. I leave filled with love and memories.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        So please … no bawling. Well, OK, just a little, but not for long. I'm happy here and probably showing my belly to someone at this very moment. Find me in a warm spring breeze, in the morning dew, in the sunbeams on your face. For some of you … may your socks never stay up and your pens always be dry.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        I didn't want a funeral. I will be laid to rest with my boys. My family will be having a Celebration of Life party at a later date. Drink a cold one, or two, for me. Please donate lots of money to an animal shelter of your choice in my memory; my favorites are Teacher's Pets and Second Chance. Carry on.

“That's for sure.

"Thousands will drop out of school because parents cannot afford to pay school fees. The quality of education has declined due to lack of learning and teaching aides and low staff morale. Incomes across the board have been eroded to nothing. Healthcare has collapsed. The cost of living is just unbearable," he said.

The thinking here is, why not? Why not turn inward? The people of this country have been bombarded with racial debates for generations, and rightly so, but since Barack Obama's election as this nation's first African-American president in 2008, it's been timely and appropriate for people to explore the depths of their own souls, to look in their own mirror as they endeavor to find out once and for all exactly what they're truly and honestly comfortable with.

In the last meeting between the teams on Jan. 11 in Calgary, Flames forward Matthew Tkachuk delivered a pair of crushing hits on Zack Kassian, prompting the Oilers winger to jump Tkachuk, a move that earned Kassian a two-game suspension that he returned from on Wednesday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Tkachuk and Kassian squared off for a brief fight during a faceoff late in the first period.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The Flames scored just 61 seconds in with a bit of a gift goal as a sharp-angle shot by Lindholm hit defender Adam Larsson’s stick and deflected past Oilers goalie Mike Smith.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Less than a minute after Calgary goalie David Rittich made a point-blank save on Connor McDavid with five minutes to play in the first, a Flames shot trickled past Smith and sat on the goal line before being cleared to safety with a millimeter to spare by Ryan Nugent-Hopkins, who then got into a rare fight with Monahan on the next shift.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Edmonton tied the game six minutes into the second period when Yamamoto scored his fourth goal in nine games up with the big club this season on a rebound.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Calgary regained the lead with seven minutes left in the middle frame as Mangiapane fired a one-timer to the top right corner.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The Oilers evened things up again less than two minutes later when Chiasson scored on a rebound in tight on the power play.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Mangiapane scored his second of the game with 45 seconds left in the second, waiting out Smith before lifting in a backhand shot.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Edmonton made it 3-all with eight minutes left in the third when Benning, a defenseman who had missed the past 20 games with a head injury, made a great move to get past Noah Hanifin and beat Rittich for his first goal of the season. That sent the game to a thrilling overtime session, when both goalies were forced to make five-alarm saves to send it to the shootout.

UK averages showed marked improvements in sentiment from the construction and services sectors, while confidence in the retail industry edged higher.          Manufacturing was the only sector which experienced a fall, with confidence declining six points to 21 per cent.          Paul Gordon of Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, said: "It is hugely encouraging to see a significant increase in business confidence for firms up and down the UK. However, Scotland saw a sharp decline, moving the region into negative sentiment.           "The overall buoyed results are also reflected by improvements in three of the four sectors and we hope that more businesses plan for growth as we continue into 2020."

Hunnam had been doing a press tour with co-star Hugh Grant for The Gentleman when he said he was not a fan of marriage.
 The Newcastle-born star said he was not being sincere, claiming when you are with friends, sometimes "you're not trying to articulate your sincere opinion about something and then you see it in black and white".
 He added: "I'm so romantic and the reality is I sort of consider myself married. I've been with my girlfriend for 14 years.
 "I suppose what I was trying to articulate is the official government sanction of it doesn't mean anything to me but the romance of it means an enormous amount."

FC Goa have a tendency to switch on and off during phases. When they turn it on, the Gaurs are devastating in attack and they tend to score in clumps. Just like they did against Odisha. Three goals in six minutes in the first half literally sealed the result for them.

Fermato dalla Polizia con un coltello a serramanico in auto: e successo a uomo, F.F., 38enne nato a Trieste e residente a Muggia. Ieri sera, nel corso di un controllo del territorio, la Squadra Volante della Questura ha fermato in via Puschi un'autovettura con il 38enne alla guida. Nel vano portaoggetti del mezzo e stato trovato un coltello a serramanico. L'uomo e stato denunciato per il possesso ingiustificato di oggetti atti ad offendere e sanzionato per alcune violazioni del codice della strada.

The bottom made of rock doesn’t exist, at least not in an objective sense. “Rock bottom” is subjective to the individual. For some, the consequence may be financial — such as losing a job or recklessly spending. For others it’s an injury, perhaps after an accident caused by impaired driving. Jessica Simpson identified her rock bottom moment as being unable to dress her children on Halloween.          Let’s forget the bottom and take it from the top. Some may be surprised to discover that the prognosis for those who struggle with drinking is encouraging. No single treatment fits everyone, but research shows no matter how severe the problem, most people with an alcohol use disorder can benefit from some form of treatment. Non-habit-forming medications, therapies and mutual-help groups help offset changes in the brain caused by alcohol.          One-third of those treated for alcohol problems have no further symptoms one year later. Others substantially reduce drinking and alcohol-related problems. Treatment works without an all-but-unrecoverable crisis. As with many conditions in medicine and in life, events can best motivate us to change. And that change can happen at any time.

"In Europe we get a range of interesting data releases on the state of the labour market in end-2019 as well as the final string of leading indicators for January with the Commission's economic confidence indicator. Employment growth has slowed recently, but in light of the dynamic service sector, we do not expect to see a marked deterioration in the European labour market. German inflation figures for January meanwhile are expected to show another increase in the headline rate driven by energy prices."

Whether a parent chooses to send a child to a traditional public school, subject heavily to the whims of school boards and teachers unions, or a public charter school or a private school is a matter best left to parents.

Schildt verwies darauf, dass die Katastrophe unmittelbar im Zusammenhang mit dem Zweiten Weltkrieg zu bewerten sei: "Das ist kein Terrorschlag 'out of the blue' gewesen, sondern die Folge eines Krieges. Der Krieg ist von Deutschland ausgegangen. Deutschland hat Europa mit Krieg, mit Mord überzogen und der Krieg ist zurückgekehrt. Dass bei der Rückkehr des Krieges Unschuldige zu beklagen sind, das ist völlig klar. Aber wer die Vorgeschichte ausklammert, in der dies passierte, der handelt zumindest ziemlich fahrlässig, weil er ein bestimmtes Szenario suggeriert, das mit der Geschichte nichts zu tun hat."

The lack of success in the biofuel industry can turn into an advantage for companies in the global dimethyl carbonate market. Players will look at refining the quality of their chemical in the coming years as demand will catch fire. To achieve high quality standards, players are likely to introduce latest refining equipment. On the other hand, it will also be important for players to enhance production facility to meet the growing demand. Expansion will be key in regions like North America and Asia Pacific where automobile consumption will grow in the coming years.

Trump faces charges from the House that he abused his power like no other president, jeopardizing Ukraine and U.S.-Ukraine relations by using the military aid as leverage while the vulnerable ally battled Russia. The second article of impeachment says Trump then obstructed the House probe in a way that threatened the nation's three-branch system of checks and balances.
 Over two days, senators are grilling the House Democrats prosecuting the case and the Republican president's defense team. Dozens of questions were asked and answered Wednesday in five-minute clips, with senators under orders to sit silently without comment, submitting their questions in writing. They finished shortly past 11 p.m. and were expected to keep going Thursday.
 Democratic leader Chuck Schumer asked whether the Senate could really render a fair verdict without hearing from Bolton or acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, both potential eyewitnesses to Trump's actions.
 “Don’t wait for the book. Don’t wait ’til March 17, when it is in black and white to find out the answer to your question,” Schiff told the Senate.
 That publication date is now in doubt. The White House on Wednesday released a letter to Bolton's attorney objecting to “significant amounts of classified information" in the manuscript, including at the top secret level. Bolton and his attorney have insisted the book does not contain any classified information.
 The White House action could delay the book's publication if Bolton, who resigned last September — Trump says he was fired — is forced to revise his draft.
 GOP senators are straining to balance the new revelations with pressure for quick acquittal. They have been sternly warned by party leaders that calling Bolton as a witness could entangle the trial in lengthy legal battles and delay Trump's expected acquittal.
 White House lawyers made exactly that point. Attorney Pat Philbin said in response to the Democrats' first question, “This institution will effectively be paralyzed for months.” That was echoed by others.

Insurers covering Tesla’s directors and executives will foot the bill as part of a so-called derivative settlement, two people familiar with the accord said on Wednesday, declining to be identified because they aren’t authorised to speak publicly about the deal.

 Ruth B. Soule, 73, of Gaines. If you're reading this, I have apparently died today, Tuesday, Jan. 28, 2020. I probably should have forwarded that chain letter. So I guess I have to tell my life story. My name was Ruth Burrous Soule. I was known by many as Ruthie, Tuke and Ma-Moo, but by those who loved me the most I was Hun, Ma and Gramma.  I was born Oct. 8, 1946 at home in the West Branch of Galeton to Lester Burrous and Virginia Knickerbocker Burrous Johnston (both predeceased me). With 11 rambunctious, and most of the time, dangerous siblings, I barely survived my upbringing in the Notch before I was swept away and married the love of my life, Gary Soule. On July 9, 1967 we became the Sexy Soules. Together we had three kids, Garri Annette, Oct. 27, 1968, Lance Lee, Oct. 27, 1970 and Jesse Arland, Feb. 6, 1973. I will joyfully meet my parents and sons in Heaven along with three of my siblings (Ronald Burrous, John Burrous and Janet Taylor), as well as my nieces, Virginia (Dubie) Bailey and Sherry Taylor, and nephews, Aaron Gill and Jerry Taylor. I was a loving wife, comforting mom, spoiling gramma, good friend and hard worker. Through my years I worked as a waitress, factory worker and lunch lady. I was as generous as anybody ever could be. I was giving away many of my possessions in my last days. By the way, would anybody like some slightly used false teeth?  I'm leaving behind the greatest gifts my daughter and son-in-law, Sam and Boo Bollock, ever gave me, my pork chop, Alivia and my hamburger, Nick, my favorite sisters, Marie Sutton and Faun James, my favorite brothers, Scott Burrous and Chester Burrous.  The things I regret most are not training my dogs to detect cancer and never sending my application to the Rockettes.  So, in a nutshell, I was born, I blinked and it was over. No buildings named after me. No monuments erected in my honor. But I was more blessed than you will ever know. I leave filled with love and memories.  So please … no bawling. Well, OK, just a little, but not for long. I'm happy here and probably showing my belly to someone at this very moment. Find me in a warm spring breeze, in the morning dew, in the sunbeams on your face. For some of you … may your socks never stay up and your pens always be dry.  I didn't want a funeral. I will be laid to rest with my boys. My family will be having a Celebration of Life party at a later date. Drink a cold one, or two, for me. Please donate lots of money to an animal shelter of your choice in my memory; my favorites are Teacher's Pets and Second Chance. Carry on. Arrangements have been entrusted to the Hess Funeral Home and Cremation Service, Galeton.

This matters for women’s representation because some research has suggested that district magnitude can influence both the supply of and demand for female candidates. Though women are generally less likely to be recruited to run for office, parties in states with multi-member districts may feel more pressure to balance their list of candidates in an effort to appeal to a wider range of voters. As University of Kentucky political scientist Tiffany Barnes explained, “Whereas access to the ballot is a zero-sum game in single-member districts, in multi-member districts multiple candidates -- from the same political party -- can occupy a place on the ballot.” And other political scientists have suggested that parties and voters may be more willing to support a woman when she is not the only possible candidate, in part because of bias against female candidates.

Xisco Hernandez and Vinit Rai started to get more on the ball and they should have had a goal back before half-time when Manuel Onwu's goal after a clever Odisha move was unjustly ruled out for offside.

Both. I think that we're going to see some organizations die because of this. Others will pivot. And new companies will fill out the balance, just as with any shift. Look at tech, for instance. How many retailers survived it? Some did a great job, right? And some, like specialty big-box retailers -- Toys "R" Us, Linens 'n Things, Staples in Europe, et cetera -- died in the process. The key in this instance is to pivot and reinvent the organization, noting that this is easier said than done, as it takes tremendous short-term sacrifice.

But Britain's sense of distance did not end there. Although as a young, up-and-coming Conservative politician, Margaret Thatcher had been a convinced European, she soon clashed with Brussels.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    While the core European countries were pushing for deeper political and legal union, Britain was pushing for a wider, looser freewheeling common market.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    London championed the arrival of former Soviet-bloc members keen to taste the fruits of capitalism, and resisted regulatory integration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Even the 1994 opening of the Channel Tunnel did not close the divide.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Thatcher was succeeded by the relatively europhile John Major, and then Labour's Tony Blair, who pledged to govern from the "heart of Europe" — but London kept and expanded its opt outs from core EU rules.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Britain received a rebate on its dues, never joined the Schengen passport-free zone and most famously did not join the union's most ambitious project: the euro.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Then in 2016, faced with a tide of euroskeptic populism from his right flank, Prime Minister David Cameron tried to settle the issue of the Doggerland divide once and for all with a referendum on EU membership.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    And, once again, Britain pivoted away from the continent.

FC Goa have a tendency to switch on and off during phases. When they turn it on, the Gaurs are devastating in attack and they tend to score in clumps. Just like they did against Odisha. Three goals in six minutes in the first half literally sealed the result for them.

In some cases, the regulations' introduction has forced organisations to get to grips with the basics of data protection for the first time, even though they had legal obligations under earlier rules, such as the Data Protection Act 1998.

The risk-off mood was further reinforced by the ongoing slump in the US Treasury bond yields. This comes on the back of a dovish assessment of Wednesday's FOMC policy update and further played its part in driving the non-yielding yellow metal higher. As was widely expected, the US central bank left its benchmark rate unchanged in the range of 1.5% to 1.75%.

Trump faces charges from the House that he abused his power like no other president, jeopardizing Ukraine and U.S.-Ukraine relations by using the military aid as leverage while the vulnerable ally battled Russia. The second article of impeachment says Trump then obstructed the House probe in a way that threatened the nation's three-branch system of checks and balances.                  Over two days, senators are grilling the House Democrats prosecuting the case and the Republican president's defense team. Dozens of questions were asked and answered Wednesday in five-minute clips, with senators under orders to sit silently without comment, submitting their questions in writing. They finished shortly past 11 p.m. and were expected to keep going Thursday.                  Democratic leader Chuck Schumer asked whether the Senate could really render a fair verdict without hearing from Bolton or acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, both potential eyewitnesses to Trump's actions.                  “Don’t wait for the book. Don’t wait ’til March 17, when it is in black and white to find out the answer to your question,” Schiff told the Senate.                  That publication date is now in doubt. The White House on Wednesday released a letter to Bolton's attorney objecting to “significant amounts of classified information" in the manuscript, including at the top secret level. Bolton and his attorney have insisted the book does not contain any classified information.                  The White House action could delay the book's publication if Bolton, who resigned last September — Trump says he was fired — is forced to revise his draft.                  GOP senators are straining to balance the new revelations with pressure for quick acquittal. They have been sternly warned by party leaders that calling Bolton as a witness could entangle the trial in lengthy legal battles and delay Trump's expected acquittal.                  White House lawyers made exactly that point. Attorney Pat Philbin said in response to the Democrats' first question, “This institution will effectively be paralyzed for months.” That was echoed by others.

Miura is a SaaS (software as a service) company so it will make its money through licence fees. Initially, its target market is brokers, fund managers and Tier 3 (smaller) banks primarily in the UK as they struggle most with the regulatory burden. A solution for larger institutions will be launched later this year. “There are well over 100 Tier 3 banks in the UK and compliance is a real pain point for them so we expect to bring a number of them on board within the first six months of 2020,” Martin says.

Next 1-3 weeks: "As highlighted, 'further weakness in AUD is likely but severely oversold conditions suggest 0.6670 may not come into the picture'. AUD subsequently dipped to a 3-1/2 -month low of 0.6737 before recovering to end the day slightly higher at 0.6764 (+0.05%). The price action reinforces our view that severely oversold conditions may 'limit' the extent of any further decline in AUD. That said, AUD is not out of the woods just yet and only a move back above 0.6830 (no change in 'strong resistance' level) would indicate that the current weakness has stabilized."

While neither of the two companies is willing to spill the beans regarding the model’s identity just yet, we’re tempted to believe it’s the Sián. As you may recall, Lamborghini’s first hybrid received the “FKP 37” suffix shortly after the car’s unveiling in the aftermath of Ferdinand Karl Piëch’s death. The number “37” refers to the year the former chairman of Volkswagen and the grandson of Ferdinand Porsche was born – 1937.

Romney, standing at the back of the chamber, smiled occasionally at mention of his name.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Far from voiding the last election, Schiff said, impeachment is protecting the next one, in 2020, from any future Trump efforts to ask foreign governments to intervene.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Republicans tried to engage the president's defense, at times raising the profile of the still anonymous government whistleblower whose complaint about Trump's July 25 call with Ukraine sparked the impeachment inquiry. Democrats kept focus on the case for Trump's conviction and removal, which would require 67 votes in the Senate and seems unlikely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    At times, there were telling exchanges. In one, the White House team could not fully respond when Collins and Murkowski asked if Trump had ever pursued Biden investigations before the former vice president announced his presidential bid in 2019.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Philbin argued that relying on foreign information in a U.S. campaign isn't necessarily a campaign law violation, drawing objections later from Democrats. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., who said he was “flabbergasted.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    In another, Dershowitz acknowledged he has changed his thinking on what the Founders intended with impeachment and keeps “refining” his views.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    As the long night drew to a close, so did Schiff's remarks, warning senators they were lowering the bar for Trump, dressing it up with legalese.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    “Corruption is still corruption,” he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    One person watching from the sidelines Wednesday was Lev Parnas, the indicted associate of Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani. Parnas arrived at the Capitol but could not enter the Senate with his court-ordered electronic-tracking device.

The FA, meanwhile, is investigating the pitch invasion that followed Aston Villa's Carabao Cup semi-final victory on Tuesday night.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Trezeguet scored a stoppage-time winner in the second leg against Leicester, sending Villa to the Wembley final on March 1 on the back of a 2-1 victory which sealed a 3-2 aggregate triumph.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Once referee Mike Dean blew his whistle to signal full-time, thousands of Villa fans took to the pitch to celebrate the club's success.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Announcements over the public address system, and a message on the screen inside the ground urging the supporters to return to their seats, went unheeded.

We have given too much to the political class and I am inclined to now draw a line in the sand, if the trucks would ever drop any on this stew of slush that bedevils us. I won’t vote in the upcoming primary. I once wrote that I never missed a vote of any kind, and some nibbler of heels...

Xisco Hernandez and Vinit Rai started to get more on the ball and they should have had a goal back before half-time when Manuel Onwu's goal after a clever Odisha move was unjustly ruled out for offside.

Schiff’s response to Dershowitz focused on one particular senator: He asked his audience to imagine what would have happened if then-President Barack Obama asked the Russians to dig up dirt on then-candidate Romney, the GOP’s 2012 presidential nominee?                  Romney, standing at the back of the chamber, smiled occasionally at mention of his name.                  Far from voiding the last election, Schiff said, impeachment is protecting the next one, in 2020, from any future Trump efforts to ask foreign governments to intervene.                  Republicans tried to engage the president's defense, at times raising the profile of the still anonymous government whistleblower whose complaint about Trump's July 25 call with Ukraine sparked the impeachment inquiry. Democrats kept focus on the case for Trump's conviction and removal, which would require 67 votes in the Senate and seems unlikely.                  At times, there were telling exchanges. In one, the White House team could not fully respond when Collins and Murkowski asked if Trump had ever pursued Biden investigations before the former vice president announced his presidential bid in 2019.                  Philbin argued that relying on foreign information in a U.S. campaign isn't necessarily a campaign law violation, drawing objections later from Democrats. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., who said he was “flabbergasted.”                  In another, Dershowitz acknowledged he has changed his thinking on what the Founders intended with impeachment and keeps “refining” his views.                  As the long night drew to a close, so did Schiff's remarks, warning senators they were lowering the bar for Trump, dressing it up with legalese.                  “Corruption is still corruption,” he said.                  One person watching from the sidelines Wednesday was Lev Parnas, the indicted associate of Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani. Parnas arrived at the Capitol but could not enter the Senate with his court-ordered electronic-tracking device. He has turned over evidence for the investigation, and said he wants to testify.                  ___                   _Associated Press writers Alan Fram, Andrew Taylor, Matthew Daly, Laurie Kellman and Padmananda Rama contributed to this report._

Researchers tracked approximately 39,000 students in state-paid pre-K classrooms from 2009 to 2014 and examined their performance on the ACT Aspire, an assessment the state used to determine how students were performing between 2014-17.

State funding for pre-K programs in Alabama has increased from $19 million in 2012 to $122.8 million last year.

One of the tricks of being property-savvy is the ability to pinpoint locations that ride on the back of established “hip” areas. As such, a rising star of the Edinburgh market is the Polwarth district. Its location just a mile and a half from The Mound/Princes Street junction makes it a popular choice for city centre employees.            Of equal importance, however is the fact that Polwarth sits cheek by jowl with Bruntsfield, a prime area for affluent young professionals where flats commonly sell or let in days rather than weeks. While there is little to distinguish between the type and quality of stock in Polwarth and Bruntsfield, prices in the former are lower and, in investment terms, have the potential to provide a superior net return.

The coal mining company Luminant, which owns Three Oaks Mine east of Elgin, has submitted a final application to release itself from land reclamation obligations.                           According to a letter submitted to Bastrop County, the mining company's application pertains to 226 acres, located east Elgin, of the mine's 16,000-acre area, which spans portions of Bastrop and Lee counties. The rural terrain that was once stripped for coal extraction will now be designated as pastureland.                           The Railroad Commission, which administers mining permits and regulates land reclamation regulations, will approve the company's permit after soil sampling and other tests are completed and that the land area is covered by vegetation. Reclamation must also ensure that the land does not "contribute suspended solids to streamflow or runoff outside the permit area" beyond the limitations promulgated by the Texas Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Act, according to the letter.                           The Three Oaks Mine operated between 2003 and 2010 and vegetation was continuously planted on the land between 2005 and 2012, the company said. The state's required Extended Responsibility Period, which requires environmental monitoring for five years to ensure the protection of surface water and groundwater resources, began in 2013.                           The mine was shuttered in 2017 along with the company's Sandow Power Plant in Milam County, which used the coal supplied by the Three Oaks Mine, and the Big Brown Power Plant in Freestone County.                           The five-year reclamation process involved moving massive amounts of earth and last year required the shuttering of Bastrop County road CR 101, located along the Lee-Bastrop County line. In exchange, the company agreed to supply land and pay for construction of a new half-mile road that will span the filled-in mine scar and connect another county road, CR 102, or Lexington Road, to FM 696. The new road would follow a similar path of a previous road that was destroyed to make way for the mine when it came to town nearly 20 years ago.                           The company also agreed to give the county $10,000 for the new road's future maintenance costs, along with a $50,000 gift to the county's animal shelter.                           Luminant purchased the Three Oaks Mine from the aluminum smelting company Aluminum Company of America, known as Alcoa, in 2007. When Luminant announced the closure of the mine and its two coal-fired power plants on the site in October 2017, it cited challenges posed by an increasingly competitive energy market.                           "These two plants are economically challenged in the competitive ERCOT market," the company said in a 2017 news release. "Sustained low wholesale power prices, an oversupplied renewable generation market, and low natural gas prices, along with other factors, have contributed to this decision."                           The closure of the mine and the plant resulted in 450 jobs lost.

The Snickers ad takes a cynical look at the world today: deriding men who ride scooters; people who text dirty photos; parents who name their kids after produce; ever new varieties of milk; autocorrect that comes out all wrong; and smart home gadgets that are spying on us.

Highkey Technology is the first and original company that Luke Lintz created which aims to sell futuristic technology to interested consumers. It is one of the few companies that has been able to utilize 'word of mouth' as the most effective tool in marketing a company. Luke was able to understand that to deliver your message you need people to form an emotional relationship with what you are doing.

“You are not doing RUSAL a favour. RUSAL recognizes that Guyana has a supreme product, which is why they are here. It’s an exchange, we are giving them our labour and they are getting our bauxite, and I believe what you are asking for, your labour is a fair compensation that should be respected. The government’s position is clear. No company will be allowed to disrespect Guyanese and, more so, our laws,” Figuera said, adding that, “With the advent of oil, many investors will come here.

Things aren’t much different defensively, albeit with more star power. It’s hard to scheme up a pass-rush the way you can a passing game on offense. Either you need superstars up front who can win one-on-one or two-on-one (like the 2007 Giants) or a secondary littered with future Hall of Famers, who take away everything on the back-end and buy the pass-rush an extra couple of beats – think of Seattle’s Legion of Boom. The Niners have tried to build the best of both worlds. They’ve imported that simplistic Seattle scheme on the back-end but added a batch of first-round pass-rushers to the mix.

Gold remains well supported by worries over the deadly coronavirus. Wednesday's dovish FOMC tilt, tumbling US bond yields supportive. Investors now eye BoE decision and US GDP print for a fresh impetus. Gold edged higher through the early European session on Thursday and is currently placed near the top end of its daily trading range, just above the $1580 region. The precious metal added to the overnight positive move and gained some follow-through traction for the second consecutive session on Thursday. Persistent worries over the outbreak of the coronavirus in China led to a fresh wave of the global risk-aversion trade on Thursday and benefitted traditional safe-haven assets - including gold. Gold supported by a combination of factors The risk-off mood was further reinforced by the ongoing slump in the US Treasury bond yields. This comes on the back of a dovish assessment of Wednesday's FOMC policy update and further played its part in driving the non-yielding yellow metal higher. As was widely expected, the US central bank left its benchmark rate unchanged in the range of 1.5% to 1.75%. However, the Fed Chair Jerome Powell, in the post-meeting press conference, admitted that he was not satisfied with inflation running below the 2% target. This fueled market expectations that the Fed would lower rates at least once this year and kept a lid on the recent US dollar positive move, which further extended some support to the dollar-denominated commodity. It will now be interesting to see if the commodity is able to capitalize on the positive move or meets with some fresh supply at higher levels. Market participants now look forward to Thursday's release of the Advance US Q4 GDP growth figures. Ahead of the key US macro data, the BoE-led volatility in the market might further contribute towards producing some meaningful trading opportunities.

Most of the talk about this category has been around who did not make the cut. With Lupita Nyong'o of "Us" and Awkwafina of "The Farewell" not nominated, expect smooth sailing for Renee Zellweger to get her second Oscar for her portrayal of legend Judy Garland in "Judy." Zellweger disappears into the role in a movie that is more about the performance than a plot-driven vehicle. It's not a copy of her Roxy persona in "Chicago," and it reminds audiences of what a great actress she is.

NYCFC Sporting Director, David Lee, said: “Gudmundur is a player we’ve been tracking for some time and we’re delighted he has chosen to join the Club ahead of other opportunities he had in Europe. We primarily see Gudmundur adding competition at left-back, but his versatility to play in multiple positions will be an asset for us as we compete in multiple competitions throughout 2020.

100% out of order & can't believe that in 2020 any ADULT football fan would want to make fun of any tragedy which in this case it was the Munich air disaster. Social media post showed fans in the Manchester City section making gestures referring to the 1958 Munich air crash, in which 23 people died, including eight United players.                      Shame on them all & why clubs don't just ban them for life it something I can't understand. There are enough cameras in these grounds now to identify the sick low life.

MIAMI (AP) — Katie Sowers answered questions on topics ranging from whether it hurt getting her ears pierced (no) to if she wants to be an NFL head coach one day (yes). For the full 60 minutes of the San Francisco 49ers' portion of media night on Monday, Sowers talked with reporters from around the world on making history as the first woman and first openly gay coach to work the Super Bowl. “I'm waiting for someone to tell me that this is all a joke, and they're going to be like ‘Psych! You're not really there. You're not really a football coach,'\" Sowers said. “It's one of those things that you really start to look around you and take advantage of every single day, especially with things happening in the news. You really appreciate the moment.\" Being the first woman to coach in the Super Bowl may be surreal. Sowers makes very clear she hopes she's blazing a path for many more to follow. “I feel like a broken record, but what I want to continue to say is that even though I'm the first, the most important thing is I'm not the last and we continue to grow it,\" Sowers said. Simply attending a Super Bowl was Sowers' dream growing up in Hesston, Kansa s, and playing football in the yard with her twin sister, Liz. She might've become a basketball coach after wrapping up her college basketball career at Goshen College in Indiana. But being gay kept her from becoming a volunteer assistant there in 2009. Current Goshen President Rebecca Stoltzfus apologized to Sowers for that last week and noted those sexual orientation policies were ended in 2015. Sowers played in the Women's Football Alliance and for USA Football's national team, including her best game ever where she intercepted five passes at safety against Germany.

She’s Madonna after all!The singer is back on stage and has resumed her Madame X world tour as she performed last night in London wearing knee support and made no mention of indescribable pain that she has been experiencing recently. Madonna was seen doing yoga poses, high kicks and even did a few splits during a high octane show that was for about two-and-a-half-hour show. The show took place in The Palladium that seats just 2286 people and thus it was Madonnas smallest-ever-full-length concert in the UK. Speaking to her fans, Madonna said, How could I not do a show in London? and added that she is happy to have made it.”The London show had dancers in gas masks, nuns playing cellos, cameos from her children and urgent messages about school shootings and climate change. The theme was all tied together by the character of Madame X, a secret agent who is a prisoner, cabaret singer, cha cha instructor, equestrian and a prostitute.

Asked if there was any chance of her reuniting with her sister, she said: 'I didn't feel that's possible given that there was so much malice, there was so much attacking when it could have been nipped in the bud and we could be playing footsies under the table.'

Move over, 2020 Democrats. President Donald Trump would like to remind voters that he, too, is on the ballot next week.

Bittium started with building Tactical communication devices for the defence industry, including Wireless IP Networks for Finnish Defence Forces for nationwide Command and Control (c2) usage. Defence communication is still the main business of the company. The consumer secure phones and medical devices were a natural area for the company to expand to, using its encryption and signal processing expertise. Bittium's medical devices include biosignal detection devices for heart, such as long term ECG monitoring, and brain, i.e. EEG recording.

FC Goa have a tendency to switch on and off during phases. When they turn it on, the Gaurs are devastating in attack and they tend to score in clumps. Just like they did against Odisha. Three goals in six minutes in the first half literally sealed the result for them.

Trump faces charges from the House that he abused his power like no other president, jeopardizing Ukraine and U.S.-Ukraine relations by using the military aid as leverage while the vulnerable ally battled Russia. The second article of impeachment says Trump then obstructed the House probe in a way that threatened the nation's three-branch system of checks and balances.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Over two days, senators are grilling the House Democrats prosecuting the case and the Republican president's defense team. Dozens of questions were asked and answered Wednesday in five-minute clips, with senators under orders to sit silently without comment, submitting their questions in writing. They finished shortly past 11 p.m. and were expected to keep going Thursday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Democratic leader Chuck Schumer asked whether the Senate could really render a fair verdict without hearing from Bolton or acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, both potential eyewitnesses to Trump's actions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    “Don’t wait for the book. Don’t wait ’til March 17, when it is in black and white to find out the answer to your question,” Schiff told the Senate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    That publication date is now in doubt. The White House on Wednesday released a letter to Bolton's attorney objecting to “significant amounts of classified information" in the manuscript, including at the top secret level. Bolton and his attorney have insisted the book does not contain any classified information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The White House action could delay the book's publication if Bolton, who resigned last September — Trump says he was fired — is forced to revise his draft.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    GOP senators are straining to balance the new revelations with pressure for quick acquittal. They have been sternly warned by party leaders that calling Bolton as a witness could entangle the trial in lengthy legal battles and delay Trump's expected acquittal.

So what is going on? Technically the palace is sticking to the letter of Andrew's new life. After standing down from all royal duties last year because, as he put it, the Epstein scandal had become a 'major disruption' to the Royal Family, he is no longer a 'working royal' and therefore the palace no longer speaks for him.

The pair remains well under pressure and continues to put the 1.1000 support to the test. Dynamics around the buck are expected to remain the exclusive driver of the pair's price action for the time being along with alternating risk appetite trends in response to developments from the Wuhan coronavirus. On another scenario, the ECB is expected to finish its strategic review (announced last Thursday) by year-end, leaving speculations of any change of the monetary policy before that time pretty flat. Further out, some better-than-expected results in the euro region as of late seem to have lent support to the idea that the bloc could have left the worst behind, although that view looks premature, to say the least.

Property taxes in Woodland and elsewhere statewide have been shifting back and forth in recent years following legislation designed to meet a court mandate to fully fund K-12 education. After a tax hike that property owners saw on their tax bills in 2018, bills in many districts dropped the following year after a cap on local levies was put in place.          For bills paid this year, however, that local levy rate cap rose from $1.50 per $1,000 of assessed valuation to $2.50 per $1,000. The rate the district put on the ballot is below that cap, maintaining a similar rate to what’s affecting 2020 taxes, and Green pointed out it was lower than the rate the district put up for a vote the last time it ran a levy replacement — it was in the $2.70 per $1,000 range when voters approved that ballot measure in 2017.          Historically, voters have been supportive of levy replacement, with Green recalling that it was back in the 1990s the last time such a ballot measure failed. Should voters decide this time around not to pass a levy, he said the district would likely have to resort to personnel cuts, given that 85 percent of the district budget is for staffing.           “That, ultimately, is a school board-guided decision,” Green said.

France was also a shrinking empire in search of a role, and it thought it had found one in the emerging European Community.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    In 1963 and 1967, De Gaulle vetoed British requests to join the bloc, fearing a loss of influence for Paris to London, with its close ties to the U.S.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    They would have to wait until 1973 and the French presidency of George Pompidou to join what was later to become the European Union.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    "One of the things the French made sure the European Union did before we joined was rigging its budgetary arrangements so they didn't work for us," said Menon, who founded the think tank Britain in a Changing Europe.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    "Part of that was to lock in a system with a view to the Brits joining, and within 18 months of us joining we were complaining about the budget rules."

To mark the 50th anniversary of the video that started it all, NFL Films is running a feature this week in which current coaches sit down and offer their own commentary while watching Stram at work. It's a tribute to the coach, and also a reminder of how boldly his stamp is still imprinted on the game a half-century later.

NYCFC Head Coach, Ronny Deila, said: “Gudmundur is a talented player and is a smart footballer on the pitch. He’s versatile and his technique on the ball is very good which is a tremendous fit for our system. He is also a competitor and goes about business in a professional way.

Somehow the Fast and Furious franchise has continued to amaze people even if they've had to go to massive lengths to do it. The movies have kept a fan base that's known for being demanding and exacting throughout the years even with stunts that many rational, reasonable people should know are impossible in real life, and it's done so with a very simple and hard-nosed style that has made no apologies and kept pushing forward throughout each story arc as the show continues to go on. This time around though things have definitely changed since from the opening of the teaser we get to see Dom and his son Brian, and Letty, living on a farm, well away from the fast-paced life of the streets. We can even hear Dom admitting that he can't live his life a quarter-mile at a time any longer, which is a big indication that fatherhood has changed him in a very profound way, but not likely enough to keep him from being the hard-charging street racer that he's been portrayed as for so long. After all, the kicker in the teaser comes when Letty gives the cross that Dom gave to her to Brian, telling him that it will protect him from 'what's coming'. How's that for a lead-in? Thankfully as Ryan Scott of MovieWeb has stated we'll be getting to see a full trailer soon that will likely give us more information that will keep the rumor mill going full tilt until summer when the movie is expected to come out.

I guess it's good that they're saying that, but I've watched a majority of the games this season, and I definitely do not believe in this team. I don't understand how Jason Botterill can speak on WGR 550 and say he's waiting to make a move. His job is on the line and he needs to help at least provide hope for next season and beyond. If that means selling, then do it, because the team this organization is putting on the ice every night is extremely troubling. The fact that they can't see that or haven't acted to make that better tells me that changes are needed.

Nel suo intervento a TMW Radio, Antonio Di Gennaro, ha parlato anche dell'addio di Florenzi alla Roma: "È un patrimonio del calcio italiano, Fonseca lo riteneva uno nella rosa ma non veniva utilizzato. Forse ha pensato di rischiare l'Europeo, dove Mancini lo fa giocare terzino. Io lo preferisco come esterno alto in un 4-4-2 o nel 4-3-3. Nella Roma negli anni è stato spostato dietro. la permanenza di Spinazzola e Santon, che l'allenatore lo vede bene, ha fatto sì che Florenzi capisse la situazione. Rimane in una piazza importante come Valencia, credo sia una soluzione che va bene per entrambi. Prestito secco? lascia un pò di malumore, soprattutto per un giocatore che non ha mai detto nulla. Sta andando via un pò tutta la romanità dalla squadra".

The 3rd Circuit Court of Appeal disagreed and vacated Bartie's convictions and sentences. The court said transcripts didn't specifically show Bartie waived his right to a trial by jury.

The full-year loss “was entirely driven by transformation-related effects” and those effects “were broadly in line with projections,” the company said. “As at the end of 2019, Deutsche Bank had recognized 70% of the anticipated cumulative costs to achieve its transformation strategy between 2019 and 2022.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The fourth-quarter figure included “transformation charges” of 608 million euros and restructuring and severance costs to the tune of 473 million euros. The net figure was dragged down further by deferred tax asset valuation adjustments of around 400 million euros related to the restructuring program.

Currently, Europe is the largest market for renewable aviation fuel due to large investments made in the region. Several airline companies such as Air France and Lufthansa have tested this fuel for commercial passenger flights as well. Several companies in this region are adopting renewable aviation fuels to reduce dependency on crude oil and reduce operating costs in the long run.

But in the absence of such attributes -- say, a rural county in a racially homogenous, conservative state like Wyoming -- multi-member districts may have given women the leg up they needed to achieve greater representation. So while it is unlikely that Wyoming, or other states that have eliminated their multi-member districts, will bring them back, organizations and parties that want to encourage greater women’s representation might try to mimic the effects that multi-member districts enabled. They could reduce the combative nature of elections, or increase the recruitment of women. Maybe that would do the trick.

European shares dropped on Thursday as concerns mounted about the economic impact of an epidemic in China that has now claimed 170 lives.
 The pan-European STOXX 600 dropped 0.9% by 0805 GMT, heading for its sharpest weekly decline in nearly four months.
 All major European subsectors were in the red with miners , which rely heavily on China for their metal exports, down 1.4%.
 The energy index slipped 2.2%, pressured by losses in London-listed shares of Royal Dutch Shell after the company's quarterly profit missed expectations on weaker oil and gas prices.
 After the U.S. Federal Reserve stood pat on interest rates, as expected, investor attention now shifts to the Bank of England's decision due later in the day, with expectations of the first rate cut in more than three years standing at nearly 50%.

Yet all these steps may only help in the long term if the UK stays closely aligned to EU research regulations.

Ik heb zelf een LG G7 en wat betreft updates is dit absoluut geen succes. De android 9 update is hiervoor al maanden uit, maar zowel via OTA updates als met LG Bridge op de computer krijg ik dit niet voor elkaar en blijft deze hangen op foutmeldingen. Na wat zoekwerk op het internet kwam hier uiteindelijk een onduidelijke reden uit waarom het voor sommige telefoons niet werkt. Er stond daarbij ook een stappenplan beschreven hoe de update wel geforceerd kon worden, nadeel wel dat je alles op de telefoon overschrijft. Een soort van factory reset naar een nieuwe image. Hiervoor eerst een backup maken en die later terugplaatsen bied dan enigszins een oplossing, maar gebruiksvriendelijk is het niet echt... Misschien straks door dezelfde hoepels springen om Android 10 te krijgen.

Schiff’s response to Dershowitz focused on one particular senator: He asked his audience to imagine what would have happened if then-President Barack Obama asked the Russians to dig up dirt on then-candidate Romney, the GOP’s 2012 presidential nominee?
 Romney, standing at the back of the chamber, smiled occasionally at mention of his name.
 Far from voiding the last election, Schiff said, impeachment is protecting the next one, in 2020, from any future Trump efforts to ask foreign governments to intervene.
 Republicans tried to engage the president's defense, at times raising the profile of the still anonymous government whistleblower whose complaint about Trump's July 25 call with Ukraine sparked the impeachment inquiry. Democrats kept focus on the case for Trump's conviction and removal, which would require 67 votes in the Senate and seems unlikely.
 At times, there were telling exchanges. In one, the White House team could not fully respond when Collins and Murkowski asked if Trump had ever pursued Biden investigations before the former vice president announced his presidential bid in 2019.
 Philbin argued that relying on foreign information in a U.S. campaign isn't necessarily a campaign law violation, drawing objections later from Democrats. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., who said he was “flabbergasted.”
 In another, Dershowitz acknowledged he has changed his thinking on what the Founders intended with impeachment and keeps “refining” his views.
 As the long night drew to a close, so did Schiff's remarks, warning senators they were lowering the bar for Trump, dressing it up with legalese.
 “Corruption is still corruption,” he said.
 One person watching from the sidelines Wednesday was Lev Parnas, the indicted associate of Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani. Parnas arrived at the Capitol but could not enter the Senate with his court-ordered electronic-tracking device. He has turned over evidence for the investigation, and said he wants to testify.

Bong Joon Ho's "Parasite" has been on a wave of acclaim since it won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival in June. Bong shows the clashes between the poor Kim family and the well-to-do Parks in a story full of black comedy, horror and suspense. "Parasite" is the first South Korean film to go all the way to the Oscars, and Bong has never been more celebrated in Hollywood than he is now.

Gold prices rose on Thursday as worries about the economic impact from a fast- spreading coronavirus in China improved the metal's safe-haven appeal.
 Spot gold rose 0.3% to $1,581.75 per ounce by 0744 GMT and U.S. gold futures gained 0.7% to $1,580.90.
 "The uncertainties surrounding the spread of the virus and its economic impact are supporting gold," said Hareesh V, head of commodity research at Geojit Financial Services.
 "Chinese (New Year) holidays have been extended, many companies have shut down … factory output etc. will be impacted, so people trust gold as a safe haven."
 Gold gained 0.7% on Wednesday after the U.S. Federal Reserve held interest rates steady and Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank was not satisfied with inflation running below 2%.
 "The Fed acknowledged the new risk (coronavirus) that has come to the market scenario, and said it didn't see 2% as a ceiling for inflation. In other words, it could continue cutting rates even if inflation remained higher," said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets.
 Powell acknowledged the risks of any short-term slowdown in China due to the virus, which has claimed 170 lives so far. The World Health Organisation (WHO) will reconvene on Thursday to decide whether the epidemic constitutes a global emergency.
 Among equities, Asian stocks slipped on worries about the fast-spreading virus.
 Limiting gold's advance, the dollar held close to a near two-month high hit on Wednesday, against a basket of currencies.
 "At a minimum, gold will remain bid until the Wuhan flu becomes a transitory event. Still, with an array of risks simmering on the back burner, gold should remain in demand for the foreseeable future," Stephen Innes, chief market strategist at AxiCorp, said in a note.
 Holdings of the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, SPDR Gold Trust, rose 0.5% to 903.50 tonnes on Wednesday.
 Palladium lost 1.4% to $2,257.14 an ounce. The autocatalyst metal has gained 16% so far this month, having hit a record high of $2,582.18 on Jan. 20, on supply worries.
 Russia's Norilsk Nickel said on Wednesday its Global Palladium Fund would deliver three tonnes of palladium ingots to the market from its current stock to provide a short-term relief to tight supplies.
 Silver gained 0.9% to $17.69, while platinum fell 1.2% to $962.46. (Reporting by Sumita Layek in Bengaluru; editing by Uttaresh.V and Subhranshu Sahu)

_“I’ve been to 85 countries and I would always recall many conversations I’d have with Africans and the African diaspora it was always comedic to me that they thought they were so different. Yes, some issues were different, but they were actually mostly the same. I believe that oceans, language barriers and different lifestyles make Africans and the African Diaspora feel that they are not one in the same, like they’re so different when they’re actually just distant cousins that haven’t seen each other/met up in a while.  Pan African Think Tank plans to bridge that gap by educating both Africa and the African diaspora during the forums of their common issues so we can come together and combat these issues on a global scale. Treating Africans and the African diaspora as one body of people called Pan Africans; citizens of Pan Africa. In the long run, Pan African Think Tank wants organizations that we partner with, to also partner with other organizations with Pan Africa.”_ explained Nichole.

"I'm waiting for someone to tell me that this is all a joke, and they're going to be like 'Psych! You're not really there. You're not really a football coach,'" Sowers said. "It's one of those things that you really start to look around you and take advantage of every single day, especially with things happening in the news. You really appreciate the moment."

"Listen, I don't know what John Bolton's book says or doesn't say," he added. "I've seen The New York Times coverage, but at the end of the day, it doesn't impact the legal issue before this Senate. The legal issue before this Senate is whether a president has the authority to investigate corruption."

Trump faces charges from the House that he abused his power like no other president, jeopardizing Ukraine and U.S.-Ukraine relations by using the military aid as leverage while the vulnerable ally battled Russia. The second article of impeachment says Trump then obstructed the House probe in a way that threatened the nation's three-branch system of checks and balances.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Over two days, senators are grilling the House Democrats prosecuting the case and the Republican president's defense team. Dozens of questions were asked and answered Wednesday in five-minute clips, with senators under orders to sit silently without comment, submitting their questions in writing. They finished shortly past 11 p.m. and were expected to keep going Thursday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Democratic leader Chuck Schumer asked whether the Senate could really render a fair verdict without hearing from Bolton or acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, both potential eyewitnesses to Trump's actions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          “Don’t wait for the book. Don’t wait ’til March 17, when it is in black and white to find out the answer to your question,” Schiff told the Senate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          That publication date is now in doubt. The White House on Wednesday released a letter to Bolton's attorney objecting to “significant amounts of classified information" in the manuscript, including at the top secret level. Bolton and his attorney have insisted the book does not contain any classified information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The White House action could delay the book's publication if Bolton, who resigned last September — Trump says he was fired — is forced to revise his draft.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          GOP senators are straining to balance the new revelations with pressure for quick acquittal. They have been sternly warned by party leaders that calling Bolton as a witness could entangle the trial in lengthy legal battles and delay Trump's expected acquittal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          White House lawyers made exactly that point. Attorney Pat Philbin said in response to the Democrats' first question, “This institution will effectively be paralyzed for months.” That was echoed by others.

“They’re not building from scratch, but they face a big technical hurdle,” said Daly. “Becoming a world-class software maker is a massive challenge.”

To mark the 50th anniversary of the video that started it all, NFL Films is running a feature this week in which current coaches sit down and offer their own commentary while watching Stram at work. It's a tribute to the coach, and also a reminder of how boldly his stamp is still imprinted on the game a half- century later.

If the start of this year has been great for the stock, the end of last year was great for the fundamental drivers of the company. They announced on the penultimate day of 2019 that they exceeded their target of delivering 131 F-35 fighter planes. The 134 that they ended up delivering came amidst a booming demand as the company built 47% more jets in 2019 than in 2018. They plan to deliver 141 F-35s in 2020 and at $80 million a plane, that's a pretty penny to have on the horizon.

Schiff’s response to Dershowitz focused on one particular senator: He asked his audience to imagine what would have happened if then-President Barack Obama asked the Russians to dig up dirt on then-candidate Romney, the GOP’s 2012 presidential nominee?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Romney, standing at the back of the chamber, smiled occasionally at mention of his name.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Far from voiding the last election, Schiff said, impeachment is protecting the next one, in 2020, from any future Trump efforts to ask foreign governments to intervene.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Republicans tried to engage the president's defense, at times raising the profile of the still anonymous government whistleblower whose complaint about Trump's July 25 call with Ukraine sparked the impeachment inquiry. Democrats kept focus on the case for Trump's conviction and removal, which would require 67 votes in the Senate and seems unlikely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          At times, there were telling exchanges. In one, the White House team could not fully respond when Collins and Murkowski asked if Trump had ever pursued Biden investigations before the former vice president announced his presidential bid in 2019.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Philbin argued that relying on foreign information in a U.S. campaign isn't necessarily a campaign law violation, drawing objections later from Democrats. Sen.

"After Cornwall we were the second-highest ranked qualifying team in Europe, so I think we've got a chance.          "If we're being brutally honest I think we need to go away there, show the talent that Jersey has to offer from a football point of view, and if that means lifting the trophy at the end of it that'd be the icing on the cake."
