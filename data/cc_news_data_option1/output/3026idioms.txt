Sweetshop owners, who were relieved by the government's decision to reopen confectionaries on the eve of Raksha Bandhan, have reported poor sales amid the Covid-19 pandemic.


  While a few said business was slowly coming back on track, others said they had never witnessed such slowdown in the market during Raksha Bandhan and the festive fervour was conspicuously missing from the markets.


  Punjab Halwai Association president Narinder Pal Singh Pappu said, "The decision taken by the state government to open sweet shops on Sunday will help the sector move past the slowdown. Initially, we were expecting low sales. Only 30-35% material is being prepared in comparison to last year, but business has improved ahead of Raksha Bandhan, as residents have started purchasing sweets. We are taking all precautions to avoid spread of infection."


  However, few shopkeepers said they were still witnessing an unprecedented slowdown in the countdown to the festival. The owner of Amanz Sweets, Model Town, Shamsher Singh, said,"We have been in business for around 12 years now, but have never witnessed such a poor response during Raksha Bandhan. Fear has gripped the residents and only around 25% people have bought sweets in comparison to the past ."


   


   


  Shopkeepers are hoping for better sales on Sunday. Owner of Chawla sweets in the Field Ganj area Mohinder Pal Singh said, "We have only received a 25%-30% response. Festive fervour is missing from the markets. We hope residents step out of their homes on Sunday and an increase in sales is witnessed."


  Social distancing a rare site


  Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh's appeal to distribute free masks with sweets received a lukewarm response. While city-based shops were seen distributing masks, shopkeepers in the interior refrained from doing so. Also, social distancing norms were not followed. While shopkeepers were avoiding crowding inside the shops, residents waiting for their turn outside the shops ignored social distancing.


  Pappu said,"The association has asked every shopkeepers to distribute free masks with sweets and take all precautions required to control spread of disease."

When it comes to sinking putts, I'm a putz.
 Over 18 holes, I don't usually make more than one or two putts that aren't gimmes. I make sure to remain 6 feet away from my playing partners during this pandemic, but I never seem to sink any 6-footers.
 My problems on the greens vary. I leave my putter blade open and miss putts to the right. I pull putts to the left. I leave them short or hit them too far. I play too much break or not enough. Other than that, I'm fine.
 I think my golf ball is afraid of the dark because it rarely finds the bottom of the cup and when it does I'm surprised. People tell me that I lack confidence, but you need putts to drop to believe in your ability. Sometimes I think I could putt better with my eyes closed.
 Of course, I rarely take the time to practice my putting. Apparently, I'm not the only one.
 Tim Bishop is the head golf pro at Tatnuck Country Club, and he's a very good putter. He once played a round in a NEPGA Section Championship in Maine and needed only 25 putts. He admits he's upset when he takes more than 28. That's eight fewer than averaging two putts per hole.
 "The biggest joy I get," he said, "is playing with people, and they're like, 'You didn't hit it good, but you shot 75 because you got up and down from everywhere.' "
 Bishop said he chipped and putted so well one day he shot a 69 at Tatnuck despite hitting only four greens in regulation.
 Bishop said that less than 5% of his lessons involve putting, but he believes that percentage should be at least 25 and maybe as high as 50. He pointed out that each par-4 hole is based on taking two shots to reach the green in regulation and then taking two putts -- half of your shots. So it makes sense to spend half of your practice time on putting.
 Far more golf courses have practice greens than driving ranges, and it doesn't cost anything to use practice greens. So there's no excuse not to work on your putting, but you need to practice the proper way.
 Most golfers practice putting for five minutes before their rounds, but few practice 30 or 45 minutes. Those who do are probably the better putters.
 Bishop stresses developing a proper putting routine. He recommends walking from the cup to your ball to get a feel of the slope of the green, and then standing 10 feet behind the ball to pick out the correct line. He likes to pick out a spot on the green about three quarters of the way to the cup and roll the ball over it toward the cup. The spot could be a ball mark, an old cup or a different color on the green. Then the key is to putt the ball with the proper speed.
 "Once you've set the ball up and you're into your routine," he said, "and you have the line for the putt, then the only worry you have is the speed. If you're worried about speed first, then nobody gets themselves lined up."
 While I wore a mask, Bishop instructed me to position my hands ahead of the putter blade and my eyes over the ball while placing 60 percent of my weight on my front foot. I hadn't been doing any of that.
 "You have to stroke the ball, not hit it," he said.
 Most golfers try to keep their putter head straight, but Bishop recommends releasing the putter head the same way you would on an iron shot. The toe of the putter must open on the backswing and close on the follow-through.
 When I tried to position my hands ahead of the ball, I opened my shoulders, so Bishop placed a club along my shoulders to show me how much I had opened them. He told me to relax my right elbow and drop my right shoulder to align my shoulders. It worked -- for at least one putt. Now I have to remember to do everything he said.
 Bishop made me feel a bit better when he said an average golfer probably sinks only 20 percent of his or her six-foot putts. So I'm not that far off.
 You can spend $425 or more on a new lie angle balance putter. Golfers have tried to putt with the claw grip, crosshanded and left-hand low.
 I've stubbornly -- or cheaply -- stuck with my old Scotty Cameron putter and the standard grip.
 Bishop recommends drawing a line or two on the ball to help line up putts. He uses Calloway triple track golf balls that come with one red line surrounded by two blue lines. Odyssey triple track putters come with the same red and blue lines as the golf balls. You can even purchase a triple track decal that can be attached to any putter.
 Shrewsbury native Brittany Altomare is one of the better putters on the LPGA Tour, and she said she spends a lot of time early each week on her speed and routine.
 "Having a solid and consistent routine is so important," she said, "especially when you get under pressure. You'll always have your routine to fall back on and then a pressure putt doesn't seem any different from any other putt."
 Bishop compares putting to kicking field goals in football. Both require developing a proper routine and picking out the correct line and distance.
 "For us, it's the break on the green," Bishop said, "for them, it's wind."
 If my putting doesn't improve, maybe I'll try kicking footballs. But probably not, because that would require even more practice.

Ask Air Force veteran Matt Mayberry why he's running for Congress and he'll quickly tell you veterans in New Hampshire "need a champion and I want to be that champion."
   
 The 55-year-old from Dover - a former city councilor and longtime Republican Party activist who served as vice chair of the New Hampshire GOP - is running for his party's nomination in the First District, which stretches from Manchester east to the Seacoast and north to the Lakes Region and the White Mountains.
   
 Mayberry - the business office and project manager at Portsmouth-based Carlisle Capital Corporation - takes aim at the Department of Veterans Affairs and at the man he hopes to challenge in November, first-term Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas.
   
 "I'm running for Congress because I found four veterans who were going to lose their access to mental health care because the VA didn't pay their bills. I went out and raised $10,000, got them taken care of, got them the care they needed," Mayberry said. "Then we found 90 veterans who were going to lose their home health care because the VA didn't pay that bill. We discovered that the VA owes the medical community in New Hampshire $134 million in unpaid medical bills. That's wrong."
   
 In a claim sure to be disputed by Pappas, Mayberry pointed to the incumbent, who's a member of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs and chair of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations and argued "he has oversight of them. He has done nothing."
   
 Mayberry said he'd also concentrate on infrastructure if elected. That's also an issue high on Pappas' list as the Democrat serves on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.
   
 "We have 17,000 miles of roads in New Hampshire. We have 3,800 bridges. They need repair. They need upgrades. We also have wastewater treatment plants that are aging out," Mayberry said.
   
 He added "with infrastructure comes expanding our fiber optic network."
   
 Mayberry was interviewed as Congress and the White House were trying to come to agreement on a new coronavirus relief package for individuals and businesses devastated by the pandemic's flattening of the nation's economy.
   
 This spring, House Democrats passed a $3 trillion relief and stimulus package. Mayberry said "a narrow scope of that bill is needed. We have businesses, and especially restaurants, that have run out of the PPP (Paycheck Protection Program) as they try to acclimate to this new economy."
   
 Negotiations in Washington over the relief bill come as President Trump has urged schools across the country to reopen in the next month or two - with students back in the classrooms.
   
 Asked the federal government's role, Mayberry emphasized "I'm the only candidate in this race who's actually served on a local school board."
   
 He spotlighted his faith in Republican Gov. Chris Sununu and state education commissioner Frank Edelbut.
   
 "I trust Chris Sununu and Frank Edelblut to educate our children, and I think the determination of our schools shouldn't be made at a federal level but at a very local school board level," Mayberry said. "Each municipality in the Seacoast has developed a plan. They want to keep their educators and their children safe and they also want to deliver a good quality education. I trust Seacoast school boards long before the federal Department of Education."
   
 Another top issue for Seacoast residents is clean water with ongoing contamination at Pease International Tradeport and the Coakley landfill in Greenland and North Hampton. Asked what he would do in Congress regarding tougher PFAS standards and expanded monitoring and testing, Mayberry stressed he'd push for "more transparency."
   
 "It's moving forward the timetable, it's working with federal EPA and state environmental services, it's working with the Department of Defense to find solutions to deliver clean, safe, drinking water immediately," he said. "It's working with every member of our delegation, it's working with town councils and city councils."
   
 And he argued "we seem to be doing an awful lot of study we're not doing a whole lot of acting. I want to move this forward. We need to stop thinking about it and talking about it and start doing it."
   
 Mayberry says he's a strong supporter of President Donald Trump. Asked where he disagrees with the president, Mayberry quickly answered "his endorsement of Matt Mowers."
   
 Mowers - a former New Hampshire GOP executive director and state director for then-New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's 2016 presidential campaign who later served in President Trump's State Department - is also running for the Republican nomination.
   
 Mayberry said he also disagrees with the president about "the tone and tenor of his tweets."
   
 "Often the tone and tenor and frequency of his tweets can be disconcerting," he said. "I believe in open and honest transparency in communication but nuance is lost in a tweet. Love the policies, not a big fan of all the tweeting."
   
 Mayberry emphasized his decades old roots in New Hampshire.
   
 "I'm the one who's been here for 35 years," he said. "I've sat on the Dover City Council, I've sat on the School Board. I delivered food through Meals on Wheels. I found in working with Flag Hill Distillery 200 gallons of hand sanitizer that went all around the state for our first responders and our police departments. I worked with 64 homeless kids in Dover High School.
   
 And he added, "I do this not as a line in my resume but as a calling in my heart."

Edward Redfield, 1869-1965: Among the New Hope Impressionist painters, Redfield was the most decorated, winning more awards than any American artist except John Singer Sargent. Primarily a landscape painter, Redfield was acclaimed as the most "American" artist of the New Hope school because of his vigor and individualism. Redfield favored the technique of painting en plein air, meaning outdoors amidst nature. He worked in the most brutal weather and would often tie his canvas to a tree. Painting rapidly, in thick, broad brush strokes, and without attempting preliminary sketches, Redfield typically completed his paintings in one sitting.

Blackrock 2-16 Erin’s Own 2-12
 Blackrock, who led by 11 points midway through the first-half, made extremely hard work of getting over the line in this Group B Cork premier SHC clash.
 Two late Alan Connolly frees and a white flag from sub Robbie Cotter were crucial for the winners in finally killing off their opponents’ brave second- half fightback.
 Erin’s Own were largely reliant on Eoghan Murphy dead-ball efforts throughout the second period, but they never allowed their opponents out of sight and when sub Alan Bowen found himself unmarked inside the cover on 50 minutes, his low shot went in off the post to narrow the deficit to one, 2-12 to 2-11.
 Crucially, though, Erin’s Own were unable to get back on level terms between there and the finish.
 Blackrock were 2-8 to 1-6 ahead at the break, a lead they might not have been overly satisfied with given their advantage stood at 11 points after 21 minutes. Their lead swelled into double-digit numbers following Alan Connolly’s goal, the scoreline showing the Rockies 2-8 to 0-3 in front.
 The full-forward’s green flag capped a 1-5 unanswered burst from the 2018 county finalists.
 Erin’s Own, who were all at sea during the opening stages, enjoyed the upper hand as the first-half drew to a close, Martin Bowen’s side hitting 1-3 without reply.
 Robbie O’Flynn - their standout performer of the opening half - was responsible for two of those three points, with Maurice O’Carroll flicking to the net an Eoghan Murphy free.
 It meant Erin’s Own had a cause to fight for upon the change of ends, but they were unable to fully reel in their opponents.

A senior officer of the Patna district administration, leading the Covid-19 battle in the state capital, tested positive for coronavirus on Saturday, on a day Bihar reported the biggest spike in Covid-19 cases with 3,521 new infections and 14 deaths. The officer, who played a proactive role in combating the virus and ensuring that the government's intervention reaches the Covid-19 affected in Patna, has opted for home isolation after he suffered a bout of fever, prompting him to take the test. A bureaucrat-turned-MP of the JD(U) also tested positive for the virus. The spike in cases coincided with the highest number of testing of samples --28,624 -- reported by the state health department on Saturday. "Of the 3,521 cases reported Saturday, 2,502 samples were tested on July 31 and 1,019 on July 30, taking the state's overall case tally to 54,508, with 18,722 active cases," said Bihar's health secretary Lokesh Kumar Singh during the media briefing on Saturday. The government's Covid-19 bulletin, which was tweeted through the state health department Twitter handle, mentioned of 14 deaths till Friday. Nine Covid-19 deaths were reported from AIIMS-Patna and three from the Nalanda Medical College Hospital (NMCH) on Saturday. Munger and Patna reported three deaths each, Bhagalpur and Muzaffarpur two each, while Araria, East Champaran, Rohtas and Siwan reported one death each, as per the government's Covid-19 bulletin. Two deaths were reported at AIIMS from Patna, and one each from East Champaran, Bhojpur, Saran, Vaishali, Aurangabad, Saran and Nalanda, according to Dr Sanjeev Kumar, Covid-19 nodal officer for AIIMS-Patna. Besides, two deaths were reported at the NMCH from Patna and one from Gaya, according to Dr Mukul Kumar Singh, nodal officer for Covid-19 at the hospital. As part of Bihar's test, track and treat strategy, Singh said the department had been able to ramp up testing to 28,624. These samples were tested on Friday. It had tested 22,742 samples on the previous day, he added. "A total 1,823 patients had recovered during the last 24 hours, taking the total number of recoveries to 35,473, with a recovery rate of 65.08%," added Singh. Bihar's chief minister Nitish Kumar, who inspected some hospitals through video conferencing, asked the hospital administration to ensure availability of doctors and also provide telephonic medical consultation to people. He asked his officials to ensure that doctors visited the patients regularly at the hospital. He also asked officials to ensure sufficient availability of ambulance to ferry patients, said Auupam Kumar, secretary, information and public relations department. Redressal of patient grievance In keeping with the CM's directive, Patna divisional commissioner Sanjay Agarwal visited the COvid-19 district control room and asked his officers to speak to patients and their relatives through video and phone calls to redress any grievance they had. He also advised them to prepare summary chart as per the requirement of patients, which should address issues like availability of ambulance, medicines, need for Covid test, requirement of doctors and paramedics, etc. He also asked officers to document questionnaire based on patient feedback. He advised them to ensure round the clock duty of doctors and paramedical staff at the Covid hospitals. He said people could avail of the facility of telephonic medical consultation by calling up the Covid-19 toll free number. Of the total 54,508 cases, Patna, which reported 442 cases on Saturday, topped the chart with an overall case tally to 9358, followed by 2638 cases in Bhagalpur, Muzaffarpur (2459), Nalanda (2266) and Gaya (2209).

    Other details include the presence of a 3,140mAh battery backed up by 18W fast charging. A dual speaker system and the Titan M security chip are included too.  
 ## Google has not cut corners with the camera
    The Google Pixel 4a is fitted with the same 12.2-megapixel main camera that graced the flagship Pixel 4 series last year. It boasts an f/1.7 aperture, optical image stabilization, and dual pixel phase detection autofocus.
    As with the original model, Night Sight will be on board to enable incredible low-light photos. Support for 4K video at 30fps and 1080p video at 120Fps is expected as well.

The world needs true leaders more than ever before. The happenings of our world do not, by and large, inspire in us any confidence about the current crop of individuals who lead their countries. We live in such connected times that it is easy to know what goes on in the back alleys of Manila or the corridors of power in Venezuela. There is no excuse for shoddy leadership, no place to hide.
 Why is humanity unable to produce inspirational and impactful leaders in this era of widespread knowledge and high learning? Why, despite all the mind- boggling progress that the world has made in artificial intelligence and high technology, have we not been able to propel the best of men and women to positions of eminence and power?
 The recently popular social media post about women leaders who have successfully contained the pandemic in their lands, starkly in contrast to a group of male heads of government who have utterly failed to do so, actually gives us a clue. Women clearly possess minds and hearts which are more empathetic and emotionally refined than do men. Whether such qualities have actually translated into concrete results on the ground as a result of leadership which cares, is a moot point. But it is evident that leaders of nations need to be extra special human beings, which is unfortunately not the case in most countries.
 All the portals of learning that society can offer, online or on campus, cannot combine to impart the skills of leadership that are actually needed by achievers. Which university for instance offers a course titled "Qualities of the Head and Heart"? It is virtually impossible to inculcate such invaluable nuances into the mindset of any person simply by educating him or her.
   
   
 Contrastingly, the general thought process of society has a major role to play in this process. When divisiveness and self-centredness become the global norm, it is impossible to produce balanced leaders. Leaders like Nelson Mandela and even Barack Obama would perhaps have at least been able to inspire some of the populace to think rightly in order for individuals to give off their best for the larger good.
 Empathy. level headedness, presence of mind, creative thinking, poise and unstinted inspiration are not injectable tonics which a youngster can gulp down. Families, schools and neighbourhoods must play a large role in infusing such delicate sensibilities into growing youngsters.
 A society gets the leadership it deserves, after all. Why are we not preparing our youngsters to become visionary, large hearted, compassionate grown ups of the future? The whole emphasis of our educational system seems to be that individual success matters, and everything else can go out of the window. And how many right-thinking youths want to enter the rough and tumble of politics? Only the rare ones, for sure.
 Even seemingly sane men often become wonky when political power is thrust upon them. Groucho Marx said, "Politics is the art of looking for trouble, finding it everywhere, diagnosing it incorrectly and applying the wrong remedies!" Many a promising leader starts appearing like a much deflated version of himself once he is in the hot seat. The grounding which potential leaders must possess and the training which they must undergo have to necessarily be firm and rigorous.
 In India, bureaucracy, industry and academia have suffered too, on account of often not being led by inspirational human beings with a sense of rectitude and probity. An ability to lead from the front and to stay calm in a crisis are sorely missing too.
 Perhaps the solution lies in actually incorporating subjects of leadership in school curricula. When leadership becomes our priority, then we will encourage the flowering of superior leadership qualities in our young ones. Role models are needed too. Theoretical imparting of knowledge about leadership will not achieve any perceptible results. Outstanding individuals from all walks of life need to be invited to walk into schools and address the citizens of tomorrow as mentors.
 As I pause to gaze out of the window into the still azure skies, I sense hope. Humanity loves a challenge. Out of the mire, will surely rise, some real heroes.

Students who apply for a first-year junior college (FYJC) seat will now get to see the list of available college options under a new option, 'Know your eligibility', introduced on the online admission portal this year. The portal will also have details of all colleges in a region such as fees and subjects offered.
 For 2020-21, around 3.19 lakh seats will be up for grabs in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) across 819 colleges. State education minister Varsha Gaikwad inaugurated the portal for FYJC (https://11thadmission.org.in) on Saturday afternoon. This year, due to the Covid-19 outbreak, the education department has introduced a zero-contact admission process for students in six regions across the state - Mumbai, Pune, Nashik, Nagpur, Aurangabad and Amravati. Students can complete the entire admission process, from filling their admission forms to confirming their seat in an allotted college, online this year. More than 1.92 lakh students registered on the portal until Saturday evening, of which over 1.72 lakh are from state board schools. "We understand the current situation and associated challenges and have hence simplified the process for admissions. We have tried to address the glitches reported in the previous years to make the process smooth," said Gaikwad.
 This year, the department has added several features to the admission portal. In addition to the feature that allows students to check previous cut-offs and colleges in their score range, the portal will allow them to address their grievances with respect to filling forms online. Students from IGCSE and ICSE boards who usually have to approach guidance centres to get their grades converted to marks for the admission process can now do it on the portal itself. Students will also be given a three-month window period to submit their original documents to the college.
 From August 1, the portal opened for students to fill Part 1 of their form, which includes basic details. The department will later notify students on the dates for filling Part 2, which includes entering marks and college preferences. The department also plans to roll out a mobile application. "It has been tested and will be launched soon," said an official from the department.

If you're interested in playing one of the "fastest growing sports in America," head on down to the Horsham Township Community Center, where six new pickleball courts just opened to the public.
   
 Pickleball is a mixture of a few different sports, including tennis, ping pong and wiffleball. Invented in 1965 in Washington state and popular in the south, it has seen a surge in new players in the area. With over three million players, the demand for courts has increased. The game is played on a court similar to a tennis court, but smaller.
   
 Four of the new courts in Horsham are outside, while two will be indoors.
   
 For the United States Pickleball Association ambassador to the Hatboro-Horsham area, Dave McPhillips, the opening of these courts has been a dream come true.
   
 "This has been my dream," McPhillips said. "I'm very grateful and lucky, dreams don't come true without the help of others."
   
 McPhillips went on to thank Horsham council members who helped get the courts built. He also wanted to thank the people who he has come in contact with since he started playing three years ago.
   
 "I want to thank the local players and people I've met," he said. "It's more about the people than the game."
   
 The game can be played by people of all ages. This is true for the Brodt family, a father-son team from Feasterville. John Brodt, 44, and his son Cody, 13, recently played together in the Hatboro-Horsham pickleball tournament earlier this month. Both have been playing for around two years.
   
 Cody Brodt said the game is "really fun." Both he and his father agreed that the opening of the new courts will be great for them.
   
 Ed Gajewski, 48, has only been playing for a year. After being introduced to the sport by his girlfriend, he said he was instantly hooked. Gajewski, from Ambler, is excited about the courts opening up near by his house.
   
 "This is just the beginning," McPhillips said.

Listen up, everybody, because this is shocking. The word is out that decency is back in the crazy world of fashion. I kid you not.
   
 Even though your daughter or niece or granddaughter has been showing her midriff since Brittany Spears started showing hers, there's evidently a revolution going on out there, in reverse.
   
 My friends who still have kids at home are still locking the doors until they give their daughters a decency check. Their oft-repeated line: "You're not going to school in that!" I guess those moms will have to dig out their own proper blouses and shirtwaist dresses to teach by example as they embrace the next wave.
   
 No less impeccable sources than several fashion magazines that now cost $10 a pop, and weigh more than a small baby, have decreed that soon, you will be seeing the relative disappearance of the shocking fashion years. And I couldn't be happier.
   
 My fashion era spanned the glorious Jackie Kennedy years when we all yearned to look like her, with her ladylike dresses and marvelous coats. Somewhere in the back of a closet is my own Jackie A-line coat. It's moved at least five times and it still time honored and adored. But I have finally gotten used to seeing vastly different fashion trends.
   
 My tolerance for visually shocking things had been slowly adjusting. And now, here comes news of a tamer era. I need some time to shift gears and sensibility.
   
 I thought we were all at last desensitized when it came to the questionable trends that were passing for fashion in recent eras. We would look at what was being worn and not worn at those awards extravaganzas without flinching unless young children were in the room. And now, we find out that soon, prim will be in. There are still those of us who remember sweet little Peter Pan collars and flared skirts. Ditto for silhouettes that weren't totally clingy and had some give.
   
 It seems that even after living through rock stars who loved to shock us, we may start seeing blouses with high necks and hemlines that graze the knee, not the thigh. From what I'm reading, we Americans actually are getting tired of "in your face" sexuality, as one magazine called it.
   
 My late mother would be pleased at this change. I recall being mortified whenever I happened to be watching TV with her when some of the "in your face" stuff flashed across the screen. She always looked away, this sweet little lady who wouldn't even wear slacks to synagogue.
   
 So, if you happened to have hung on to those sedate little shirtwaist dresses or lace-collared shirts, you may just find yourself ahead of the curve. I for one still have my late 1960s black velvet boat-neck dress that I wore with pearls to countless boring parties. It lurks somewhere in the back of a hall closet just waiting to be resurrected.
   
 Somewhere there still hangs my plaid pleated skirt that I'd always hoped to pass on to granddaughters who laughed when they saw it and wanted to borrow it for Halloween.
   
 Right now, it's looking mighty good to me since its forgiving lines mean no tortuous spandex. And if that's part of what fashion modesty means, bring it on.

First and foremost, Thank you. Thank you to each and every individual who has prayed for me, thought of me, sent me their love and has showered me with their support. In this present moment, it is my only responsibility to be real with myself and to be real with the ones who truly love me and care for my healing. I have without fail, shared with you my brightest days, and I know that sharing with you what has been my darkest will be the light for any man or woman who is feeling the same defeat I felt just only a week ago. Every one of us has a desire, whether small or big, to make it out of where we come from to an ideal future place that includes, freedom to be who we choose, security for our children and families, and fortune to share with the ones we love. We believe these things can co-exist with just being happy. I believed that, that as a black woman, as an artist, an influence, a personality I could shape my world, and with whom I believed to be my partners, they could help me share my world. Over the past 11 years there were promises made to protect and portray my story, with the authenticity and honesty I gave. I was betrayed, taken advantage of, overworked, and underpaid. I wrote a letter over 2 months ago asking to be freed from what I believed was excessive and unfair. I explained in personal detail the demise I was experiencing. My cry for help went totally ignored. However the demands persisted. It was my spirit, and my soul that was tainted the most. There are a few things I count on most to be, a good mother, a good daughter, a good partner, a good sister, and a good person. Who I was, begun to mean little to nothing, because it would only be how I was portrayed on television that would matter. It was witnessing the slow death of the woman I became, that discouraged my will to fight. I felt like I was no longer living, I was existing for the purpose of a corporations gain and ratings, and that killed me. Mental illness is real. We have to normalize acknowledging it and stop associating it with shame and humiliation. The pain that I have experienced over the past 11 years has slowly ate away at my spirit and my mental.

Ludhiana Sweetshop owners, who were relieved by the government's decision to reopen confectionaries on the eve of Raksha Bandhan, have reported poor sales amid the Covid-19 pandemic. While a few said business was slowly coming back on track, others said they had never witnessed such slowdown in the market during Raksha Bandhan and the festive fervour was conspicuously missing from the markets. Punjab Halwai Association president Narinder Pal Singh Pappu said, "The decision taken by the state government to open sweet shops on Sunday will help the sector move past the slowdown. Initially, we were expecting low sales. Only 30-35% material is being prepared in comparison to last year, but business has improved ahead of Raksha Bandhan, as residents have started purchasing sweets. We are taking all precautions to avoid spread of infection."However, few shopkeepers said they were still witnessing an unprecedented slowdown in the countdown to the festival. The owner of Amanz Sweets, Model Town, Shamsher Singh, said,"We have been in business for around 12 years now, but have never witnessed such a poor response during Raksha Bandhan. Fear has gripped the residents and only around 25% people have bought sweets in comparison to the past ." Shopkeepers are hoping for better sales on Sunday. Owner of Chawla sweets in the Field Ganj area Mohinder Pal Singh said, "We have only received a 25%-30% response. Festive fervour is missing from the markets. We hope residents step out of their homes on Sunday and an increase in sales is witnessed."Social distancing a rare sitePunjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh's appeal to distribute free masks with sweets received a lukewarm response. While city- based shops were seen distributing masks, shopkeepers in the interior refrained from doing so. Also, social distancing norms were not followed. While shopkeepers were avoiding crowding inside the shops, residents waiting for their turn outside the shops ignored social distancing. Pappu said,"The association has asked every shopkeepers to distribute free masks with sweets and take all precautions required to control spread of disease."

According to an affidavit filed in the case, Home Depot's security department went to the FBI in 2018, after years of attempting to thwart Farinato, whom they suspected of thefts dating back to 2014. The chain had banned him from their stores in 2016 and in 2018, but he continued showing up at various New England locations.
 Store security quickly recognized Farinato when he allegedly came and went from a Londonderry, New Hampshire, Home Depot three times on the morning of July 25, 2018, court papers say. They watched as he pulled numerous boxes of Phillips Hue lightbulbs from a shelf, carried them to another aisle, then removed some of them from their boxes and put them into various pockets of his cargo shorts, court papers say.
 Farinato then climbed into a bay inside the store, where he dumped the boxes, then walked out of the store with the bulbs. He then returned, investigators said, two more times that morning and took more bulbs out of the boxes he had stashed in the bay.
 The bulbs, which can be programmed to change color, dim or turn on and off via a "smart home" app, are pricey, coming in at just under $50 each; Farinato allegedly also took a "starter kit" worth nearly $200.
 The total loss to that store on just that morning was more than $2,100. Farinato allegedly drove straight to Salem, then to an Eastern Bank branch in Danvers, where he cashed a check for $160.
 Later that day, Farinato returned to the Salem business, carrying a bag that appeared to be full; he left with an empty, rolled-up bag.

This is an important partnership that we need to continue to further promote our shared mission of highway safety.”
 In 2018, there were 701 crashes in work zones on state roads and bridges, resulting in 13 motorist fatalities and 329 injuries to motorists, contractor employees, and NYSDOT staff.
 The NYSDOT noted that “motorists are required to move over a lane if safely possible for vehicles along the road displaying red, white, blue, amber or green lights.

Making myself a glass full of tea, I glance after many years at the volume of memoirs and poems in English translated from Punjabi, of poet Lal Singh Dil. On the front cover he is referred to as the Poet of the Revolution, but the back cover carries lines of his poem negating the title. The poem reads: For us trees do not bear fruits, For us Flowers do not bloom, For us there is no spring, For us there is no Revolution! Memory not being what it was, I wonder at the contradiction between the title and the poem. But then life is often a jumble. Then I turn the pages of the book and somehow spill a little tea on a page with my shaky hands. In panic I try to rub it off but the pale brown stain is there for keeps and on the next page I find the picture of the poet pouring steaming tea from a jug with half a smile on his lips.
 ## Dil with his comrades, writers Amarjit Chandan and Prem Prakash.
 And there I am in the tea shack opposite the motor market on Machiwara road in Samrala town, which I would once frequent to meet the legendary poet of Naxalbari. He is acknowledged till date as one of the top 20 poets of Punjabi with his poetry inviting research and scholars penning copious thesis.
 Dil too had dreamt of a revolution and a time when he would no longer be the outcaste whose bowl had to be thrown into fire for purification after he had sipped his tea and the water jug at the party meeting would not be pulled away when he tried to reach out to it for some water. Well, such are the contradictions of a caste-ridden society and he realised that for the Dalits there was no revolution. The comrades of his Naxalbari days had returned to their folds and were now editors, executives, professors, businessmen or expatriates.
 Dil was the first of his tanner clan to complete school. His mother had to sell the only pair of gold earrings she possessed to buy him a bicycle to pursue a junior basic teacher training course. He would have come up in life but then came the dream of the revolution and claimed him as one of its own. However, when the dream died, he had nowhere to go. So after jail, police torture and harassment of his family members, he chose exile in the fruit orchards as a caretaker, embraced Islam to escape the caste stigma; convinced that 'Allah is very kind to Maoists because he understands cultures!' This was what he wrote to his poet friend Amarjit Chandan in explanation of choosing to convert to Islam and have a religion to call his own. Alas! He was to find that even there caste existed.
   
   
 When he returned home to Samrala and was desolate after his mother's death friends tried to help by setting up the tea shack with wooden planks nailed together. Dil found in the drug addict upper caste friend Pala a partner and happily poured tea from a dented jug into the glasses in a tote for the drivers, mechanics, teachers and writers who frequented his shack in the motor market. When free he would scribble some lines in between or talk to the literati that gathered there to discuss poetry and politics. And I awaited my tumbler of tea, asking for a little less sugar and a little more ginger in the brew. Tea shacks were my haunt all through youth but tea had never tasted as good as it did in downtown Samrala!
 The tea shop closed after Pala's death when, disoriented, Dil forgot to keep accounts or collect payments. When I went to meet him years later in his one- room brick home built on the family plot of Chamar Basti with a little open space, I found the wooden planks of the tea shop stacked in the 'kacha kotha', perhaps for firewood. A little flower bed in a corner had a couple of red roses blooming amid green leaves. And his little hungry grand-niece would come crawling up the stairs to take a sweet from the kind old man who knew that her mother's breasts did not have enough milk for her.
 No matter how hard life is, Lal, there is always room for a few green leaves, a child's smile and some sweetness. Oh! Let me add a little more sugar to my tea.

Ghaziabad Cis-Hindon area of the district reported the most number of Covid-19 cases in July, reversing the trend when trans-Hindon area comprising prime localities such as Indirapuram, Vaishali and Vasundhara had accounted for maximum positive cases till a month earlier. After Unlock 1 which started June 1, the trans-Hindon area was high on positive cases with a share of 52.72% while the cis-Hindon had a share of 33.7% of the 1,267 cases in the month, according to figures of the health department. The trend, however, has got reversed with the opening up of more activities under Unlock 2 and more testing taken up with the help of rapid antigen kits since June 26, officials said. In July, share of trans-Hindon area went down to 39.12%, while the cis-Hindon had 47.57% share of the total 3,134 cases reported in the last month, as per the official records. However, overall, the trans-Hindon area still has the maximum number of cases. As per the figures, areas of trans- Hindon, cis-Hindon and rural accounted for 44.22%, 41.92% and 13.87%, respectively, as their share in Covid-19 cases till the end of July. Notably, the first Covid-19 case was reported in Ghaziabad on March 5. "If we look at the overall figures, the trans-Hindon had about 2% more cases till July 31. Initially the trans-Hindon area was largely affected as many people go to Delhi for work. There was effect of cross-border infection. That's why containment exercises were carried out in Khoda, Vaishali and Loni which yielded results and cases decreased," said an officer from the health department, who wished not to be named. The trans-Hindon area, close to Delhi border, and cis-Hindon area are primarily separated by river Hindon. The cis- Hindon area comprises old city areas which have planned and unplanned colonies, and major markets. The trans-Hindon area, on the other hand, has more of planned residential localities and comprise majorly high-rise societies in Indirapuram, Vaishali, Kaushambi, and Vasundhara, among others. The district administration said that irrespective of spread of cases in the cis-Hindon area, it is focusing on early detection, faster testing and immediate referral of Covid-19 cases for treatment. "We have taken several steps to contain the Covid-19 spread. The testing has also improved vastly with the introduction of rapid antigen kits. We are also keeping in check the fatality rate and measures have yielded results. The spread of cases in cis- Hindon area in July could be due to high density of population as people started mixing after activities were allowed and more of testing taken up," said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. "Our surveillance and other teams are working round the clock. Besides, more of rapid response teams will be roped in to keep track of patients in home isolation. The monitoring of such patients will be strict. Our focus is to reach out to maximum people who have contracted virus. With all efforts, our discharge rate has touched 83.32% (till July 31), which is encouraging," Pandey added. The overall figures of the residential segments in trans-Hindon indicate that Karhera-2 (comprising Indirapuram, Makanpur and Kanawani) has reported highest number of 549 cases, segment of Sahibabad-2 (Raj Bagh, Shalimar Garden, Rajendra Nagar, Lajpat Nagar, etc) account for 363 cases, Vaishali (comprising Vaishali, Ramprastha, etc) account for about 248 cases, while Vasundhara has about 233 cases.In cis- Hindon area, the Carte segment (Kavi Nagar, Avantika, Nehru Nagar, Shastri Nagar, Chiranjeev Vihar, Daulatpura, Maliwara, Mahindra Enclave, Ashok Nagar, and Nasirpur) has about 371 cases while Raj Nagar segment (Raj Nagar, Sanjay Nagar, New Friends Colony, Govindpuram, Kamla Nehru Nagar, Panchsheel Primrose, Guldhar, Bhatta Number 5, etc) has about 341 cases, Vijay Nagar-1 segment (Krishna Nagar, Ambedkar Nagar, Vijay Nagar, SP (city) office, Pratap Vihar, New Vijay Ngar, old Vijay Nagar, Mawi, Vijay Ngar PS, etc) has about 243 cases, while Sadik Nagar (Raj Nagar Extension, Sihni village, Noor Nagar etc) has about 222 cases. The rural area that includes Dasna and Loni, among others, reported at least 446 cases till July 31, as per the records. "During the initial months, the trans-Hindon area, which is are very close to Delhi border, was more affected. Now, with less cases being reported in Delhi, the infection is also on decline in trans-Hindon. Besides, initially the testing was more concentrated on high risk groups which largely surfaced from trans- Hindon areas," said Dr VB Jindal, president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad chapter). "Now, the testing centres have come up in all areas of the district and anyone can walk-in and get tested. So, city areas with high density of population churned out more positive patients in June-end and also in the month of July. However, the figures indicate that overall cases are now on decline in Ghaziabad for the past 10-15 days," he added. According to official records, the Ghaziabad district had collected 105,202 samples for Covid-19 test till July 31, out of which test reports were received for 105,099 samples. The testing included 61,258 tests done through rapid antigen kits from June 26.

ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- An infamous bus appears headed to a new home at a museum in Fairbanks after being removed from Alaska's backcountry to deter people from making dangerous, sometimes deadly treks to visit the site where a young man documented his demise in 1992.
   
 The state Department of Natural Resources said Thursday that it intends to negotiate with the University of Alaska's Museum of the North to display the bus, which was popularized by the book "Into the Wild" and a movie of the same name and flown from its location near Denali National Park and Preserve last month.
   
 "Of the many expressions of interest in the bus, the proposal from the UA Museum of the North best met the conditions we at DNR had established to ensure this historical and cultural object will be preserved in a safe location where the public could experience it fully, yet safely and respectfully, and without the specter of profiteering," Natural Resources Commissioner Corri Feige said in a statement.
   
 The bus became a beacon for those wishing to retrace the steps of Christopher McCandless, who hiked to the bus in 1992. The 24-year-old Virginia man died from starvation when he couldn't hike back out because of the swollen Teklanika River. He kept a journal of his ordeal, which was discovered when his body was found.
   
 McCandless' story became famous with author Jon Krakauer's 1996 book "Into the Wild," followed nine years later by director Sean Penn's movie of the same name.
   
 Over the years, people from around the world have traveled to the bus, located about 25 miles (40 kilometers) from the town of Healy, to pay homage to McCandless.
   
 Two women have drowned in the Teklanika River on such visits to the bus, one from Switzerland in 2010 and the other from Belarus nine years later. There have been 15 other search-and-rescue missions since 2009, state officials said, including five Italian tourists who needed rescue last winter. One had severe frostbite.
   
 The draw of the bus became too much for state officials, who arranged for the Alaska Army National Guard to remove the bus with a helicopter last month as part of a training mission.
   
 The former Fairbanks city bus is sometimes called Bus 142 or the Magic Bus. It was later used to house construction workers building a road in the area. It was abandoned in 1961, and became a shelter for those using the backcountry to recreate or hunt.
   
 The department received dozens of suggestions for use of the bus that came from individuals, museums and institutions nationwide, with varying plans to preserve, exhibit, monetize or memorialize it, Feige said.
   
 The department decided to consider the university's proposal, which had several advantages. It's just one of three official state repositories, and the only one in the Fairbanks area able to accept and curate state-owned historical items. The museum also has the staff to restore, curate and display the bus.
   
 This proposal also allows the Department of Natural Resources to retain ownership of the bus, and decide future uses, including whether to lend it out for display and where.
   
 "I believe that giving Bus 142 a long-term home in Fairbanks at the UA Museum of the North can help preserve and tell the stories of all these people," Feige said. "It can honor all of the lives and dreams, as well as the deaths and sorrows associated with the bus, and do so with respect and dignity."
   
 The department anticipates signing final paperwork within the next few months.

Donald Trump raised the specter Thursday of a delayed presidential election -- citing unfounded claims of mail-in ballot fraud. His tweet sent shivers through Americans who fear he'll stop at nothing to remain in office.
   
 By all accounts, Trump lacks legal authority to postpone the vote and, in any event, the Constitution says his first term ends Jan. 20. The presidential election has never been delayed in an American history replete with times of war and pestilence.
   
 But where the president succeeded, and can do still more damage, was fomenting confusion and angst ahead of an election already fraught with risks to its integrity.
   
 Millions are frightened even to cast votes at a time when a highly communicable disease is running rampant through too many communities. States are racing to accommodate by expanding mail-in voting, even though many have not done so at this scale.
   
 Fumbling primary efforts in several states led to hours of waiting in line for in-person ballots. While voter enthusiasm is high, new registration is in free fall -- particularly among young people and minorities -- as coronavirus undermines traditional sign-up efforts.
   
 It's little wonder that growing numbers of Democrats and Republicans are primed to reject election results that don't go their way.
   
 The good news is there's still time to build confidence in the Nov. 3 vote:
   
 • A fair election during a pandemic costs money. Congress must settle differences on a coronavirus stimulus bill, and that includes coming together on election money for the states. Republicans need to embrace the funding, and Democrats need to ease up strings attached to the spending so the two sides can compromise.
   
 States must hire and train younger poll workers -- perhaps attracting them with the offer of education credits -- since traditional volunteers are predominantly older people understandably averse to working during an outbreak where they are at higher risk of infection. Where early in-person voting is expanded, as it should be, those workers will be needed for longer periods of time.
   
 • Make mail-in voting work. However much Trump and Attorney General William Barr (without evidence) rail against the process, the risks of fraud are almost nonexistent. Thankfully, most states aren't listening. The result is that more than 80 million voters are being mailed ballots or applications to vote by states, and an additional 96 million will be able to vote by mail if they request it. That's 77% of the voting population.
   
 It's another reason federal funding is crucial. States and counties will be investing in additional ballot-counting space, equipment such as high-speed scanners, and specialized envelopes and paper, to facilitate record levels of mailed ballots. And staffing needs will grow still further. States should accept mailed ballots postmarked by Election Day, as opposed to those that arrive by Election Day, in anticipation of an overwhelmed Postal Service (run by a Trump supporter who has already slowed down processing). In the alternative, states could provide more drop-off sites for absentee ballots to avoid relying on the mail.
   
 • Voters need to be vigilant and patient. Those who want to mail in their vote should begin to act now to request a ballot and return it as soon as possible to avoid having it rejected for arriving too late. Others can learn whether and where early voting will be conducted in their precinct to avoid long lines.
   
 More than anything, voters need to understand that the winner of the election may not be known at the end of Nov. 3. The odds are strong, particularly given the days it could take to count mailed-in votes, that the result will be tardy. It certainly won't discredit the results, no matter what Trump might say or do.
   
 This election will test not only the integrity of the electoral process, but also whether, as the Declaration of Independence asserts, governments "deriv(e) their just powers from the consent of the governed." Trump's tweets shouldn't distract from the need to get the vote right.

Sweetshop owners, who were relieved by the government's decision to reopen confectionaries on the eve of Raksha Bandhan, have reported poor sales amid the Covid-19 pandemic.
 While a few said business was slowly coming back on track, others said they had never witnessed such slowdown in the market during Raksha Bandhan and the festive fervour was conspicuously missing from the markets.
 Punjab Halwai Association president Narinder Pal Singh Pappu said, "The decision taken by the state government to open sweet shops on Sunday will help the sector move past the slowdown. Initially, we were expecting low sales. Only 30-35% material is being prepared in comparison to last year, but business has improved ahead of Raksha Bandhan, as residents have started purchasing sweets. We are taking all precautions to avoid spread of infection."
 However, few shopkeepers said they were still witnessing an unprecedented slowdown in the countdown to the festival. The owner of Amanz Sweets, Model Town, Shamsher Singh, said,"We have been in business for around 12 years now, but have never witnessed such a poor response during Raksha Bandhan. Fear has gripped the residents and only around 25% people have bought sweets in comparison to the past ."
 Shopkeepers are hoping for better sales on Sunday. Owner of Chawla sweets in the Field Ganj area Mohinder Pal Singh said, "We have only received a 25%-30% response. Festive fervour is missing from the markets. We hope residents step out of their homes on Sunday and an increase in sales is witnessed."
 Social distancing a rare site
 Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh's appeal to distribute free masks with sweets received a lukewarm response. While city-based shops were seen distributing masks, shopkeepers in the interior refrained from doing so. Also, social distancing norms were not followed. While shopkeepers were avoiding crowding inside the shops, residents waiting for their turn outside the shops ignored social distancing.
 Pappu said,"The association has asked every shopkeepers to distribute free masks with sweets and take all precautions required to control spread of disease."

Srinagar (Jammu and Kashmir) [India], Aug 1 (ANI): Chief Secretary (CS) of Jammu and Kashmir BVR Subrahmanyam and Director-General of Police (DGP) Dilbag Singh on Saturday visited parts of Srinagar city area to take stock of the security and deployment arrangements on the occasion of Eid al-Adha.   Accompanied by IGP Kashmir Vijay Kumar and SSP Srinagar Haseeb Mughul, the DGP and the CS interacted with territorial officers and jawans deployed on duty.   During the tour, they visited MA Road, JC Flyover, Secretariat, Batamaloo, Court, Bemina, Qamarwari, Safakadal, Nalamar, Khanayar, Rainawari, Nageen, Foreshore, Nishat and Boulevard areas.   The tour was primarily aimed at taking stock of the on-ground security measures and deployment of forces in the city besides greeting civilians, J&K Police and forces personnel on the occasion of Eid al-Adha.   While interacting with the territorial officers, the CS and the DGP directed them to be alert and cautious as "anti-national elements are hellbent to disturb the peaceful environment."   The CS and the DGP further directed the officers to take due care of the jawans deployed on naka and other duties. They said that good coordination with other security forces on the ground is to be maintained for achieving desired outputs.   Eid al-Adha or Bakr-id, also known as "Sacrifice Feast" is marked by sacrificing an animal, usually a sheep or a goat to prove their devotion and love for Allah. After the sacrifice, devotees distribute the offering to family, friends, neighbours and especially to the poor and the needy. (ANI)

We're pretty much used to everything happening social distancing-style by now, and the BAFTAs are no exception. But it's not all doom and gloom, as it's the adjusted TV awards ceremony we've got to thank for the latest adorable pictures of _Normal People_'s Paul Mescal and Daisy Edgar-Jones. There are some perks, right?
 Enjoying a "surreal" reunion, the pair, who play Connell and Marianne in the BBC Three series, were comically dutiful while standing two metres apart at the event - even holding a tape measure between them as they posed for the cameras.
 And as well as being a great example of how to follow the rules, the new pics have proven our theory that these two have the power to look cute doing, well, literally anything.
 Sadly, the pair weren't up for any awards themselves as _Normal People_ didn't air in time to be considered, but they were enlisted to present a gong alongside __host Richard Ayoade. However, the show has been widely recognised by other awards ceremonies, withPaul adorably dedicating his Emmy nomination to Daisy after she missed out on a mention of her own.
 Sitting two metres apart (of course) during an interview backstage at the BAFTAs, which was held at the BBC in London without an audience, the two stars revealed how they've come to terms with _Normal People_ 's "whirlwind success".

Students who apply for a first-year junior college (FYJC) seat will now get to see the list of available college options under a new option, 'Know your eligibility', introduced on the online admission portal this year. The portal will also have details of all colleges in a region such as fees and subjects offered.


  For 2020-21, around 3.19 lakh seats will be up for grabs in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) across 819 colleges. State education minister Varsha Gaikwad inaugurated the portal for FYJC (https://11thadmission.org.in) on Saturday afternoon. This year, due to the Covid-19 outbreak, the education department has introduced a zero-contact admission process for students in six regions across the state - Mumbai, Pune, Nashik, Nagpur, Aurangabad and Amravati. Students can complete the entire admission process, from filling their admission forms to confirming their seat in an allotted college, online this year. More than 1.92 lakh students registered on the portal until Saturday evening, of which over 1.72 lakh are from state board schools. "We understand the current situation and associated challenges and have hence simplified the process for admissions. We have tried to address the glitches reported in the previous years to make the process smooth," said Gaikwad.


  This year, the department has added several features to the admission portal. In addition to the feature that allows students to check previous cut-offs and colleges in their score range, the portal will allow them to address their grievances with respect to filling forms online. Students from IGCSE and ICSE boards who usually have to approach guidance centres to get their grades converted to marks for the admission process can now do it on the portal itself. Students will also be given a three-month window period to submit their original documents to the college.


  From August 1, the portal opened for students to fill Part 1 of their form, which includes basic details. The department will later notify students on the dates for filling Part 2, which includes entering marks and college preferences. The department also plans to roll out a mobile application. "It has been tested and will be launched soon," said an official from the department.

Sue Peters wins everything.
 At Southbridge High, she pitched the softball team to a 50-game winning streak and a state championship, led the basketball team to a district championship and became the school's all-time leading scorer, and paced the field hockey team and the Border Conference in goals as a senior.
 At UMass-Amherst, she also became the all-time leading scorer in basketball and she pitched the softball team into the AIAW World Series twice.
 She was inducted into the athletic halls of fame at both schools.
 She even won in the classroom, making the National Honor Society in high school and graduating from UMass with a 3.91 grade point average to earn Academic All-America honors.
 Peters also went on to coach the Westwood High girls' basketball team to a state championship.
 Yeah, she wins everything. Well almost everything.
 Peters, 61, retired in 2017 after teaching health and physical education at Westwood High for 30 years and phys ed at Thurston Middle School in Westwood for five.
 These days, she referees Division 2 and 3 college basketball games during the winter, but she golfs four or five days a week during the summer at George Wright GC and William J. Devine GC in Boston. Peters carries a handicap of just under 11 and has competed in the club championship at William J. Devine about eight times. She has finished second three or four times, but has never won it.
 "I'm better at the team events," the 5-foot-7 Peters said in a recent telephone interview. "I think I've realized that I'm more of a team sports person than I am an individual sport athlete. I've come close, but I haven't been able to put it over the finish line."
 She didn't play in the recent club championship because she's been bothered by a sore knee the past few weeks. She believes the soreness developed while riding her mountain bike. To stay in shape, she goes on bike rides around Boston anywhere from 10-12 miles up to about 40 if she takes the Minuteman Trail up to Bedford.
 "I'm in decent shape," she said, "but I could be in better, for sure."
 She may be in her 60s, but she's still Sue Peters, one of the best athletes that Central Mass. has ever produced -- male or female.
 She was such a great athlete, she played a year in the Women's Professional Basketball League for the New Orleans Pride. Butch van Breda Kolff, who had coached the Lakers to two NBA Finals against the Celtics, was her coach. Peters worked her way into the starting lineup and finished as the team's second leading scorer.
 The league folded after the season, its third. Peters tried to play in a pro league in Germany, but a right knee injury ended her pro playing days.
 Unfortunately, there was no WNBA around when she was at her peak.
 "I would like to think if I were born in today's generation," she said, "with a lot of hard work, that would be something that I would have been able to obtain."
 She doesn't waste any time wondering what may have happened if the WPBL hadn't folded and she considers her time with the Pride as the pinnacle of her sports career.
 "I was just a tremendous experience," she said. "Do I wish the league would have gone on longer? Absolutely, because one year was just not long enough. But I don't have any regrets. Back then people were just appreciative that the league even gave us an opportunity."
 Peters is single and lives in West Roxbury with her 86-year-old mother, Kathryn, who moved from her Southbridge home a few years ago. Peters returns to Southbridge often to see her brother, Eliot, and other relatives.
 Eleanor Tremblay coached Peters for four years at Southbridge High and also taught her in her honors biology class.
 "I often wonder with Sue's intelligence," Tremblay said, "and all of her skills how she would have been able to be part of a UConn or a Notre Dame or any of those great current basketball schools for women. I think she would be a great team player. I think she'd do just fine because she was determined."
 Tremblay said Peters knew instinctively how to position herself on the court, how to get open, when to go to the basket to grab a rebound and, most importantly, how to be a team player. Peters scored 1,701 points for Southbridge, but Tremblay believes she could have scored far more if she weren't a team player. The team would have suffered, however.
 Peters credited her coaches and said she was fortunate to play with such talented teammates as Lisa Corbitt, Jackie and Janice St. Laurent, Sheri Brousseau and Cheryl Caouette. She may be too modest to mention it, but she was clearly the best player.
 "She was a fighter," Tremblay said. "She wasn't the biggest person on the team. Other teams had the height, but we had the agility and she was an aggressive player. She wouldn't be afraid to take the shot, to take a chance and a good number of times those chances were fruitful."
 "My family would vouch for this," Peters said. "I'm just a big, sore loser. It doesn't matter what it is. It could be a card game or a Monopoly game, I've just always been a sore loser."
 That determination to avoid losing drove her to practice almost obsessively, starting back in elementary school. She would shoot baskets at the playground by herself and remain until she made a certain amount in a row. She would bounce a beach ball off the roof of her neighbor's garage and repeatedly jump up and catch it while still in the air. That drill helped her become a good jump shooter and rebounder.
 For UMass, Peters scored 1,858 points and averaged 20 per game. Forty years later, both are still school records.
 "I figure that records are made to be broken and it's surprising to me that it has survived as long as it has," Peters said.
 In addition to being a star pitcher in softball, Peters was an excellent hitter who never struck out in high school. As a junior, she led Southbridge to a 9-8 victory in 10 innings over Apponequet Regional of Lakeville in the first state softball championship game held in Massachusetts.
 Southbridge fell behind, 6-0, in the first inning, but coach Dick LeDuc's squad rallied to win. Peters scored the winning run and finished the season with a 23-0 record.
 "Nerves got the better of us in the first inning," Peters said. "We had a big mountain to climb, but we never gave up."
 At UMass, she had a .390 career batting average, set a since-broken school record with 51 stolen bases, was 38-2-1 on the mound and pitched a no-hitter against New Hampshire as a senior.
 In 1985, she coached Westwood over Oakmont, 65-54, for the state girls' basketball championship at the DCU Center, then called the Centrum. Peters remembers telling her players not to be afraid to make mistakes, but to remain aggressive. They listened and pulled away at the end.
 Basketball became Peters' favorite sport after she graduated from UMass because she has remained it in by refereeing college games for more than 25 years. The pandemic will likely curtail her refereeing next season, but last year she refereed Division 2 and 3 games in New England, including games at Assumption and Clark. She enjoys it when fans recognize her and talk about her playing days.
 "That's part of what makes being in a sport for so many years so special," she said.
 In 2013, Peters was named to the inaugural class of the Atlantic 10 Conference Women's Basketball Legends. She has won her share of trophies over the years, but she admits if you visited her home, you'd never know it. She stores them in boxes.
 "It's just not who I've been," she said. "It's an internal thrill that I have, and I've never felt I needed to look at a trophy or a plaque for that to be meaningful to me."
