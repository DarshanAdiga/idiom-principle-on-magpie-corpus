NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Shai Werts had three touchdown runs and threw a 65-yard scoring pass to help Georgia Southern beat Louisiana Tech 38-3 in the New Orleans Bowl on Wednesday. Werts, who missed the Eagles' last two regular- season games because of a shoulder injury, scored one of his touchdowns on a designed QB run that covered 37 yards. His two other rushing TDs came from a yard out. Georgia Southern came up with four interceptions — including two near its own goal line in the first quarter. Safety Justin Birdsong intercepted two passes — the first against Louisiana Tech starter Aaron Allen and the second against reserve JD Head in the third quarter. Georgia Southern (8-5), which came in averaging 262 yards rushing, finished with 322 against Louisiana Tech (5-5). Malik Murry broke off a 43-yard run on the game’s opening drive to set up Werts’ first short TD run. Gerald Green added a 55-yard run in the fourth quarter to give him 108 yards and one TD rushing for the game. Werts finished with 71 yards rushing. The Bulldogs were trying to win a bowl for the seventh straight season, but could not overcome three interceptions thrown by Allen inside the Georgia Southern 30 in the first half. Allen's first turnover came when Birdsong stepped in front of a pass at the 5 on a first-down play from the Eagles 17. Tech's next possession ended when cornerback Derrick Canteen intercepted his sixth pass this season on the Georgia Southern 1 on a Tech first down from the 26. The second turnover set up Werts' deep pass to Khaleb Hood to make it 14-0. Allen threw his third interception in the second quarter, when safety Anthony Wilson picked off a quick slant pass at the 25 on a second-and-10 from the Eagles' 30. Tech was on the verge of being shut out in the first half when...

PERKASIE, Pa. - When I first met Christina Rushton, owner of the Rise and Grind Cafe in Perkasie back in July, she thought she was going to have to throw in the towel for good.
 She was only open three months before the pandemic began, and like so many restaurants was struggling to survive, and now five months later not only is she still open but she's excited for the future.
 "I still cannot believe I'm here today, I'm proud of myself," Christina said.
 Christina was one of the many newly opened businesses stuck between a rock and a hard place.
 New businesses, specifically, couldn't get any help. Mostly all grants or loans required businesses to be open for at least a year, a rather perplexing and frustrating requirement that left the most vulnerable hanging out to dry.
 "It doesn't seem fair for new businesses, not just me, any new business and you see businesses that are multi-million dollar companies getting assistance," Christina said.
 But what stuck out about Christina was her perseverance. In July when I first met her, the community stepped in with a small $2,000 grant. It wasn't much, but it lit a fire in the mother of three to carry on.
 "It just gave me that extra push to keep going and to really try to figure out what we can do with this space,” Rushton said at the time. "It gave me that extra push to really make it work."
 And carry on she has. "I just make it work. I have to. I wouldn't change it for the world."
 Reworking the space over and over with a local market, grab and go food, and now delivery.
 "We try it. If it works, it works. If it doesn't we move on and try something different,” Rushton said.
 With no help from anyone. She ended up returning that community grant after some on social media falsely accused her of crying wolf: "I decided to donate it back to Pennridge FISH, to donate it back to our community."
 She takes each new restriction in stride, so she can keep her nine employees working, often at the expense of her own paycheck.
 "I didn't want to furlough my staff again," Christina said. "I'm going have to just roll with the punches and keep us safe as much as possible, and pray that it does not go past January 4 because last time it lasted for three months."
 She made it it to her one-year anniversary last week. She's hopeful she can keep enough money coming in to hold on till summer.
 "Going back to 100% and trying to recoup is my hope," Christina said. "I'm just hoping next Christmas-after all said and done-that we're able to gather as community."
 Something tells me she will.
 "I'm just a lot stronger than I thought I was," Christina said.

SAN ANGELO, Texas - Texas is no stranger to flooding, as many in the Concho Valley know from years prior. But funding is being approved for flood planning and response, thanks to efforts by the Texas Water Development Board. By and large right now a wave of planning is the focus across the state, to better prepare for flooding before, during and after. A key goal right now is to have all flood maps and planning updated and moving forward by 2024, with recurring updates regularly.

The massive voter fraud that nobody in mainstream media or Big Tech is willing to discuss must be investigated by the Department of Justice. Lame duck Attorney General William Barr never put serious effort into it, and some would say he likely hampered any efforts to expose the widespread theft of our election results. But patriots know some of the truth and now President Trump is calling for a special counsel to help expose the rest of it.

Notably, these benefits are likely to bolster the adoption rate of the cash-a- check feature as it ensures health and safety by allowing the customer to en- cash the stimulus check by staying at home.      This remains a major positive and crucial amidthe current coronavirus-induced health crisis.      Moreover, in the current scenario, where consumer’s preferences to make online and contactless transactions, and stay away from physical dealings as a preventive measure, owing to social distancing,is spurring, PayPal with its fee waiver move is well-poised to gain investor optimism.      Hence, we believe that the company will witness growth in its customer base on the back of its latest move during the ongoing pandemic, which has caused disruptions to several businesses and individuals.      This, in turn, will drive the company’s top-line growth in the near term.      Coming to price performance, shares of the company have returned 125.1% on a year-to-date basis, outperforming the industry’s rally of 121.8%.

Retired attorney Norm Miley made his case for a recent golf resurgence as he finished fourth. Dave Moyles rallied from a tough start to land in fifth. In the Red Tee Flight, Steve Weyrauch, who helps raise money for animal rescue services, was the winner. Weyrauch loves all animals, especially dogs. He is admired for never cursing after a wayward shot, but he does bark. Sly Rich Spense was second. Jack Cox strutted his stuff to tie red tee champ Earl Watkins for third. George Dillon credits the inspiration of his playing companions for his fifth-place finish.
 Closest-to-the-hole competition took place on No. 2 and No. 13. From the white tees, Roger Ladd laughed his way around the course—as well as to the bank—as he took all the money on No. 2. On No. 13 Dean kept a winning streak alive finishing first. Tom Suarez, who came dressed like the abominable snowman, somehow made a swing with all that clothing to take second.
 From the gold tees, Pense and Stockland fought to a draw. Stockeland took first on No. 2 and second on No. 13. Pense reversed the order on both holes. From the red tees, Earl Watkins made the shot of the day on No. 2 landing 3 feet, 6 inches from the hole. He added to his treasure of the day by placing second on No. 13. Larry Rupley returned to form by placing second on No. 2 and Gene Weatherby continued his winning way in this event as he took first on No. 13.

I wanted to reach out and thank our generous community on behalf of the Rotary Club of Rutland.
 In light of the hardships we all face this year, our club started a Gift-a- Tree program, where generous folks could buy a Christmas tree that would be given to a family in need.
 Being the first year for this program, we were not sure how it would go, but are pleased to announce that more than 160 trees were gifted! We were lucky to have a strong partnership with BROC, which coordinated with five other area social service agencies and distributed the tree vouchers.
 Each family that came to the Rotary tree shed was also given a children’s book to go under the tree and an ornament to hang on the tree. We hope to continue this new tradition in years to come. A full list of this year’s donors can be found at www.rutlandcityrotary.org. Thank you!
