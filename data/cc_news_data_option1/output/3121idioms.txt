Novavax (NASDAQ:NVAX) was upgraded by analysts at Zacks Investment Research from a hold rating to a buy rating. The firm currently has $176.00 price target on the stock. According to Zacks, "Novavax is making good progress with its nanoparticle seasonal influenza vaccine candidate, NanoFlu. A BLA for NanoFLu using the FDA's accelerated approval pathway is expected to be filed shortly. If successfully developed, the company believes that NanoFlu will be a game-changer for the prevention of influenza. Meanwhile, Novavax received a funding of more than $390 million from the CEPI for the clinical development of its coronavirus vaccine candidate, NVX-CoV2373. However, in absence of a marketed product, Novavax is yet to generate any revenues from product sales. Dearth of collaboration contracts too remains a woe. Thus, any delay in the pipeline development will hurt the stock. Shares of the company have significantly outperformed the industry year to date."

 “She actually lived out a life and fought for the rights of people,” and “was the first person to fight the park and win,” after waging a years-long legal battle against Virgin Islands National Park to reclaim ancestral land from the federal government, she said. “She fought the park back in the ‘80s and she won. She was the first person to do that in the Virgin Islands. So, she was a trailblazer, and she was true to form, in reference to saying, ‘If it’s not right, let’s move forward.’ ”

 The odds of its formation into a tropical cyclone, which is a rotating storm system that could strengthen into a tropical storm or hurricane, stood at 10% over the next 48 hours, according to the latest public advisory. It is during this time frame that conditions are most conducive for its development, the NHC said Friday.

Wednesday’s demonstration, organized by Put People First! PA, protested the proposed rezoning and redevelopment of St. Joseph’s Hospital, along with other health care issues around downtown Lancaster.
 The arrests began around 4:05 p.m. while the group was standing in front of state Sen. Scott Martin’s office.
 First, police said a woman moved into West Chestnut Street while holding a sign and was arrested. Jessica Lopez confirmed in an interview that she was the first person arrested. Police said they gave “numerous” warnings before the arrests.
 Minutes later, another woman was arrested while sitting in the right lane of the street. Several minutes later, a man was arrested while he was also standing in the middle of the street, police said. Dylan Davis confirmed in an interview that he is that man.
 All three were charged with obstructing highways and other public passageways, which is a third-degree misdemeanor, according to police.
 Lopez, who was the first demonstrator arrested, has a pending federal case against Lancaster city detective Nathan Nickel for allegedly sexually assaulting or hurting her after a Nov. 8, 2018, traffic stop.
 According to Davis, the last of the trio to be arrested, the original police release about the arrests was “very inaccurate.”
 First, he disputes that Lopez was in the middle of the street — he says she was standing in a parking spot on the right side of the street when officers approached her. Even then, Davis said that Lopez was not the sole person standing in the parking spots but was the only person arrested.
 According to Lopez she was initially standing in an unoccupied parking space in an effort to socially distance herself from demonstrators on the sidewalk when an officer approached her and asked her to move onto the sidewalk.

JACKSON TWP. Officials believe they'll have no trouble finding talent to kick off music and entertainment at the new Jackson Amphitheater in North Park.
   
 "We're getting a rush of local bands who want to open it," township Fiscal Officer Randy Gonzalez said. "They may even want to pay us."
   
 Work on the new amphitheater took more than a year to complete. The project started in early May 2019 and concluded May 27 of this year, according to the township.
   
 The concert area is ready for live entertainment; however, when folks can enter the venue for performances and educational programming depends on COVID-19. The township is waiting for Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine to allow social gatherings of more than 10 people.
   
 "Planning (entertainment) right now for us is like having a brand new Corvette and not being able to take it out of the parking lot," Gonzalez said.
   
 Live band music may be the primary draw, according to Trustee Todd Hawke. But other worthwhile uses like movie nights, comedy shows, trophy presentations for high school sports and book readings hosted by the Stark County District Library are in the works, he said.
   
 "Our big idea is to have a free summer concert series, with local bands, like LaFlavour and Disco Inferno," said Hawke, adding that three or four larger- ticketed performances will be slated annually.
   
 Local musician dazzled
   
 Craig DeBock, lead singer for LaFlavour, said he toured the Jackson Amphitheater earlier this summer and came away highly impressed.
   
 "The sound system is amazing. We can't wait to play there," he said.
   
 A state-of-the art audio system has been tested multiple times, Hawke said. Township officials advised that additional sound testing could result in music being played loudly at North Park.
   
 Jackson-based Northeast Productions is contracting with the township to seek "high tier" musical acts that could be part of a three-or-four show slate. Hawke and Gonzalez were uncertain of any bands that might be pursued.
   
 Township sanctioned events, such as the annual Easter egg hunt and Christmas tree lighting ceremony, will get underway at the amphitheater, too.
   
 "Once we get going, this will entertain the smallest kid to senior citizen," Gonzalez explained. "There will be something (here) for everyone."
   
 In addition, the township will host its annual Jackson Community Celebration on the amphitheater grounds and parking area. The shindig was canceled in July due to the COVID-19 outbreak.
   
 By the numbers
   
 The approximately $4 million complex, which has a covered stage, classic street light posts, a grassy seating area and new parking lot, can seat up to 4,000 for live events. There is no designated seating, as attendees will be required to bring their own chairs or blankets.
   
 The amphitheater and grounds total 4 acres, in addition to the 3.5-acre parking lot and access drive. The new Stark County library, which is a separate project, encompasses approximately 2 adjoining acres.
   
 Parking lot construction began in late May and is expected to conclude later this summer.
   
 SoL Harris/Day Architecture was the designer of the amphitheater, which was constructed by Cavanaugh Building Corp. of Akron.
   
 Officials are working to acquire a liquor license for patrons of the amphitheater, said Hawke, adding that alcohol will remain prohibited at all other areas of North Park.
