The German economy grew by 0.6pc in 2019, the weakest expansion rate since 2013 and a marked cooling from the previous year, a preliminary estimate from the Federal Statistics Office sh Economists polled by Reuters had expected growth in gross domestic product (GDP) of 0.6pc last year after an expansion rate of 1.5pc in 2018. "This means that the German economy grew the tenth year in a row. This is the longest growth period since German reunification," statistics official Albert Braakmann said. The office said the budget surplus of the public sector, including federal states, municipalities and social security systems, fell to €49.8bn or 1.5pc of GDP after €62.4bn or 1.9pc in the previous year. Exports edged up by 0.9pc last year after a 2.1pc increase in 2018 while imports rose by 1.9pc following a 3.6pc jump, the office added. This suggests that net trade had a negative impact on overall economic growth last year. Germany's export-dependent manufacturers are contending with sluggish foreign demand in light of a slowing world economy and uncertainty linked to trade disputes and Britain's decision to leave the European Union. The automobile sector is also struggling to adjust to stricter emissions regulation and a shift to electric vehicles.

“Antonio redefined what the tight end position looks like and is responsible for how we evaluate and view the position in today’s NFL,” he said. “Rewriting the record book is obviously part of it, but when you needed a big block, needed to convert that first down, needed a steadying voice in the huddle or leadership in the locker room, that was Antonio. He didn’t just do one thing well, he did everything well. And that’s what makes him a first ballot Hall of Famer in my book.”

“I thought our guys really battled well.”
 For the Panthers, in something of a rare occurrence, only two players scored and both had the same point total. Senior Trevor Barker and junior Logan Rodgers shared game high-scoring honors, each with 22 points.
 “Obviously, their size was going to be a big factor,” Stiverson said. “I thought our guys did a really good job. We wanted to make sure we were pressuring the basketball, making it tough, first of all, for them to enter it in there.
 “Then, when they did enter it into the post, we wanted to really help out. Number three (Barker) for them really stepped up. He hit some big shots and got hot for them. That made it tough on us.”
 Junior Isaac Ward led the Braves, making 4 of 7 three-point shots on his way to a team-high 20 points. Junior Gabe Chalfin scored 13 points (with three treys) and junior Jason Sailor also scored 13 (with three threes).
 There was a lot of back and forth in the first half of play, especially the second quarter.
 Logan Elm led by as many as seven points and the Panthers trailed by as little as one point, which was the margin at the end of the first quarter, 14-13.
 The teams exchanged the lead five times in the second quarter.
 Miami Trace took a 21-20 lead into the locker room.
 The third quarter was the turning point in the game.
 Miami Trace scored two points and had eight turnovers, while Logan Elm scored 14 points and committed one turnover.
 The Braves held a 34-23 lead after three quarters of play.
 “The third quarter was the difference,” Miami Trace coach Rob Pittser said. “We came into the game really concerned about Logan Elm’s three-point shooting. They have more capable three-point shooters on the floor than anybody on our schedule. They shoot more threes and make more threes than anybody we play.
 “In the third quarter, they didn’t completely run away from us, but they built enough of a lead. With a team that has that many kids back, a six or seven- point lead can feel like a 10 or 15-point lead.”
 Miami Trace got the start it needed with a 7-0 run to begin the fourth quarter.

Text: "South Korea saw its employment rate hit a 22-year high last year, boosted by a stronger-than-expected job growth in December, government data showed Wednesday.Asia’s fourth-largest economy, however, continues to face structural problems as the latest result was mostly attributable to the government’s policy efforts and also focused heavily on specific age groups.The country recorded 27.15 million workers employed in December -- up 516,000 from a year earlier -- marking the largest on-year growth in more than five years, according to Statistics Korea.As of the end of the year, the figure stood at 27.12 million employed, up 301,000 from the previous year. The corresponding on-year growth figure for 2018 was 97,000.The employment rate last year stood at 60.9 percent, up 0.2 percentage point, hitting the highest in 22 years.For those aged between 15 and 64 -- a comparative standard for the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development -- it came to 66.8 percent, the highest since Seoul started tallying such data in 1989.The statistics office attributed the improved job indexes to the government’s active fiscal spending and also the base effect from the previous year. Minister of Economy and Finance Hong Nam-ki holds a press briefing at Seoul Government Complex on Wednesday. (Yonhap)Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Hong Nam-ki, in a policy briefing held at Seoul Government Complex, claimed that Korea has “succeeded in achieving a ‘V-shaped rebound.’”Despite the apparent improvement in overall figures, however, Korea continued to struggle with the sluggish employment situation for people in their 40s and those working in the manufacturing sector.The youth unemployment rate also seemed to decline but expanded subindicators showed that the actual unemployment level still remains high.Last year, the country’s 40-somethings shed 162,000 jobs compared to a year earlier, marking the steepest on-year fall since 1991. The employment rate for the corresponding age group also fell to 78.4 percent, down 0.6 percentage point.“(The government) will come up with a comprehensive set of measures by March (to deal with the 40s age group),” said the finance minister, acknowledging the challenges.While several of the service industries gained jobs on the back of government spending, the country’s backbone manufacturing sector lost 81,000 jobs in 2019, due to sluggish exports.The elderly aged 60 or more, on the other hand, added 377,000 new jobs, marking the steepest on-year increase since the government started compiling such data in 1963.As for young adults aged between 15 and 29, the employment rate reached 43.5 percent, the highest since 2006. The corresponding figure for those in their 20s was 58.2 percent, up 0.3 percentage point on-year.But the expanded employment index -- designed to reflect the actual job market reality by including potential job seekers -- stood at 22.9 percent, the highest since 2015.While reviewing the latest job situation, the government also underlined the need to adjust the indicators in order to reflect the demographic reality.“We should change the paradigm of our (job) indicators so as to prioritize the employment rate (over the number of newly added jobs),” Hong said.“We need (new) indexes that may precisely reflect the demographic changes and job market reality.”The on-year change in newly added jobs has conventionally been deemed a key index, reflecting the overall stream of the job market.But in light of the low birthrate and aging society, the simple comparison in the number of newly added jobs no longer holds validity, according to the fiscal policymaker.Korea’s economy saw its working age population -- aged between 15 and 64 -- shrink 56,000 on-year in 2019. Such on-year decline is expected to accelerate further this year as the baby boomers who were born between 1955 and 1963 are set to reach retirement age.By Bae Hyun-jung (tellme@heraldcorp.com)",

Arsenal has become the latest team to make a move for Dries Mertens as the Belgian begins talking to Foreign clubs.
 Mertens’ current deal expires at the end of the season and the Belgian can start speaking to foreign clubs this month.
 He has been a target for several top European sides following his contract situation and Metro Sports citing Sky Italia is claiming that Arsenal has already made an approach.
 The Gunners have had to rely on Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang for much of their goals this season, but the Gabon captain is currently unsettled at the Emirates.
 Aubameyang is keen to play for a team that can compete for trophies and according to the same report, he has told Mikel Arteta that a move to a top club interests him.
 He will have just one season left on his current deal when this campaign comes to an end and there is every possibility that he won’t renew his terms.
 Mertens has scored over 100 goals for Napoli and the Belgian’s versatility makes him an attractive attacker to have.
 He can play through the middle and on the wing and showed against Liverpool that he can score some impressive goals.
 The competition for his signature is growing, but Mikel Arteta will hope that playing in London would appeal greatly to him.

Barker had a steal and a bucket for the Panthers to make it 38-34, Logan Elm.
 There was a somewhat rare goal-tending call on the Panthers on Logan Elm’s next possession.
 Up 40-35 with 2:49 remaining, Logan Elm went on a 6-2 run to extend the lead to 44-37 with just over one minute remaining.
 At this stage, the Panthers had only committed three fouls in the second half.
 Miami Trace (8-8) got busy and began to foul to stop the clock and send Logan Elm to the line.
 In the final 34 seconds, the Braves made 6 of 6 free throws.
 Rodgers scored the final basket of the game on a put-back to set the final tally at 50-44.
 The Braves (9-4) resume Mid-State League Buckeye Division play on Friday at Liberty Union to close the first round of league play.
