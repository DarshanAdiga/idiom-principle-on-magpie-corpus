Gonzalo Higuain is not sure if he will leave Juventus for River Plate, though the striker would like to retire at his boyhood club.
 Higuain has been linked with a move away from Serie A champions Juve – a return to Argentine powerhouse River on the cards.
 The 32-year-old – also the subject of reported interest from MLS clubs LA Galaxy and DC United – emerged from River's youth system in 2005 before leaving for LaLiga giants Real Madrid two years later.
 Higuain addressed his future and talk of a River reunion, telling TyC Sports: "River are a club that gave me everything, from letting me develop to Real Madrid buying me, but right now I don't know what's going to happen. My head is here [in Turin].
 "[Marcelo] Gallardo's team are very exciting, they have quality, strength, everything...
 "The truth that you watch them and their number nine gets many chances. Clearly someone who played for River before will watch that team, see themselves there and say, 'how nice'.
 "Gallardo has caught everyone's eyes and he's earned it. I'd think about going back to River to retire."
 Prior to the coronavirus pandemic suspending the Serie A season in March, Higuain had scored five goals in 23 appearances.
 In total, Higuain had netted eight goals across all competitions for Maurizio Sarri's Juve in 2019-20.

Smith, 30, is thankful to the Cowboys for giving him another chance in the NFL where he will be reunited with defensive line coach Jim Tomsula from his days with the 49ers.”
 “God has blessed me with talent,” Smith said. “And one of the talents is my natural gift to play ball, to be an athlete. So, I still feel young. I don’t have the mileage on my body. I still feel great when I go to the gym. I still feel young and fresh. So, if anything, I’m looking forward to what I’m going to be able to do out there.”
 Smith is excited about what he and the Cowboys can accomplish on the field in 2020. The team is counting on him to help bolster a pass rush that lost 2019 leading sacker Robert Quinn to the Chicago Bears in free agency.
 Outside of Pro Bowler DeMarcus Lawrence, the Cowboys have no real proven pass rushers and could use a boost from Smith.
 “That just means I always work hard,” Smith said. “I always play hard. I want the same thing out of my teammates and I’m sure those guys in the locker room feel the same way, and with that mentality, the sky is the limit. I think as long as we do what we need to do and everybody plays to their potential anything’s possible.”

During the pandemic, stir-crazy Americans have flocked to binge-friendly shows including “Normal People,” “Ozark” and “Dead To Me.” Major streaming services have reported growth in subscriptions and viewership, as the lockdown tightens TV’s stranglehold on entertainment primacy.
 The theater world, economically distressed by the virus, is finding ways to clamber along. Performers from the Broadway adaptation of “Spring Street” worked from home to give their postponed show a belated digital opening. And The Public Theater, a Greenwich Village playhouse, churned out a new production over Zoom called “What Do We Need To Talk About?” that drew tens of thousands of viewers.
 “There’s an upside to everything,” Cox said. “The downside is very clear in what’s happening at the moment. But the upside is that work is being produced, and people want to see it. They want to see stuff.”
 Meanwhile, films have seen their release dates postponed, and movie houses slumber from coast to coast. The Celebration Cinema in Grand Rapids, Michigan, is shuttering. The Mahoning Valley Cinema in eastern Pennsylvania has closed its doors, too.
 Many more closures may follow. During the crisis alone, Hollywood projects to lose billions in revenue.
 Cox said he sees an opportunity to kick-start a beloved business that for too long has sent denizens streaming into blockbusters “with their popcorn spilling all over the place.”
 “We regard it as sort of a cattle institution,” he said.
 He hopes Hollywood will look itself in the mirror during the crisis, unwinding back to an earlier time. In recent years, he mused, “there was no new energy, no new life.”
 “Movies I worry about, because I just think movies seem to be all about spectacle,” Cox said. “Films have become very mundane, and I think it’s a great shame.”

10 Tips for Tiny Living🏡 1. Downsize - start with the category of stuff that is easiest for you to let go of. Once you start letting go of stuff you will find it’s easier to get rid of more, and even enjoyable. A good place to start is your “junk drawer” 2. Read books, listen to podcast or watch documentaries on minimalism to inspire you to get rid of the extra stuff and keep it away for good. If you need recommendations just ask, we have tons. 3. Multifunctional pieces - you want to maximize your area in a tiny space and a good way to do that is to make as many multifunctional pieces as possible. In our bus our cabinet door comes off and turns into our table, our steering wheel doubles as an office desk, our couch is the guest room, and our roof top deck is also a storage room. 4. Question everything! Ask: “have I used this in the last 3 months, and do I plan to use it in the next 3 months?” If the answer is no then donate it. 5. Adopt the “In one out one” rule - this really helps to avoid accumulating a bunch of stuff that you don’t really use. If we get new shoes, clothes, decorations, etc., then we have to get rid of an old one. It also causes you to be super intentional with your purchases. 6. Keep flat spaces clear - clutter attracts clutter. 7. Make your bed - the state of your bed is the state of your head, so keep it tidy and organized and the rest of your house will feel the same. 8. Do dishes immediately - you kind a have to when you only have a few dishes 9. Invest in collapsible items. - a few things we have are bowls, chairs, coffee pour over, etc. 10. Make anything digital that can be made digital - paperwork, photos, drawings your kids made you, etc. Have any tiny tips of your own? Share your knowledge in the comments.

Chiefs general manager Brett Veach said Gay is capable of playing any of the three linebacker spots – SAM (strong side), MIKE (middle) or WILL (weak side).
 But initially, Spagnuolo has determined, they will line him up on the outside.
 “We think, without knowing right away, or we’re hopeful, I should say, that he would replace what Reggie Ragland did for us last year,” Spagnuolo said. “I preface that by saying we won’t know that until we get him in. I think we’re a long way away.
 “You guys get it. He comes from college into the pros – trying to get him up to speed takes a little while.”
 Ragland played 235 snaps last season – on the field mostly for early-down and run-heavy situations – but signed a one-year free-agent deal with Detroit in March.
 The Chiefs bring back two starters in the linebacker group, with Anthony Hitchens and Damien Wilson. Ben Niemann also played 401 snaps a year ago.
 But Spagnuolo has proven unafraid to make alterations. The Chiefs began 2019 with Hitchens, Wilson and Darron Lee before Lee lost his spot after just two games, prompting Wilson to shift from SAM to WILL.
 Gay projects potential to be an every-day player rather than a situational one. He can cover, which would fill perhaps the most glaring need on the team’s defense. And he can play the run. Chiefs special teams coordinator Dave Toub also sees him as a regular member of the special teams units.
 In any normal year, late May would be too early to turn the optimism any rigid determinations. In 2020, amid the coronavirus pandemic preventing on-field work, it seems even earlier.
 “If feels like 2011 when we had the lockout when I was in St. Louis. Now, we’re way ahead of that because we have all these Zoom meetings,” Spagnuolo said. “But I think Willie Gay will begin there (on the outside). Whatever else we can do with him, we’ll build on that.”

The NHL Players' Association's executive board is voting on a 24-team playoff proposal as the return to play format, according to a person with knowledge of the situation.
   
 The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity Thursday night because the vote was still ongoing. Results of the vote could be in as soon as Friday night.
   
 Even if the executive board votes to approve the format, it doesn't yet seal the deal for the NHL season resuming. The league and players union still need to negotiate other details, including health and safety protocols.
   
 But the format is a substantial piece of the return to play puzzle.
   
 Under the plan proposed by the joint NHL/NHLPA Return To Play Committee, the top four teams in each of the Eastern and Western Conferences would play each other for seeding while the remaining 16 teams face off in a best-of-five series play-in round to set the final 16 to compete for the Stanley Cup.
   
 That would mean byes for Boston, Tampa Bay, Washington and Philadelphia in the East and defending champion St. Louis, Colorado, Vegas and Dallas in West. Pittsburgh, Carolina the New York Islanders and Rangers, Toronto, Columbus, Florida and Montreal would also make it in the East and Edmonton, Nashville, Vancouver, Calgary, Winnipeg, Minnesota, Arizona and Chicago in the West.
   
 "I feel like if you're doing the 24-team thing, it basically gives a team a chance that had no chance of making it, which if you play 82 there's maybe 6, 8% chance that the team in 12th place (in the conference) makes it," Carolina player representative Jordan Martinook said Wednesday, more than 24 hours before the executive board meeting. "Nobody's ever seen this before, but at the end of the day, the Stanley Cup Playoffs are 16 teams, seven games a series."
   
 This format would lead to the traditional four rounds of seven-game series.
   
 "I don't think there's going to be a perfect scenario where everyone's super excited about," Nashville's Ryan Johansen said earlier Thursday. "As long as everybody can agree and be happy with the decision that will be made, that's really all that matters."
   
 If the NHLPA's executive board and the league's board of governors approve the plan, the who of returning would be set. The where, when and how must still be determined, including how many cities will host games, quarantine regulations and testing.
   
 "Nothing's really certain until it's certain, so things can change so quickly and they have on different things," Return to Play committee member James van Riemsdyk of the Flyers said Wednesday. "We're trying to keep as many options open and navigate through different things and hopefully come up with a vision that obviously first and foremost is the health and safety of everyone."
   
 Commissioner Gary Bettman this week said the league was looking at eight or nine locations to serve as hub cities for the resumption of the season.
   
 It's unclear when the league and players will agree to begin the second phase of preparations for return, which would be the reopening of team practice facilities and voluntary workouts. The following step would then likely be a three-week training camp before games resume.
   
 "Obviously it's an important thing to navigate through all the different issues that there are so that ultimately we can try to find a safe way to get things going here," van Riemsdyk said. "There's been some different talks and things like that and talking about a bunch of different things and trying to sort through some different issues."

Southeastern Conference schools will be able to bring football and basketball players back to campus for voluntary activities starting June 8 at the discretion of each university.
   
 The SEC's announcement Friday is the latest sign that a college football season will be launched in some form this fall. The move comes two days after the NCAA Division I Council voted to lift a moratorium on voluntary workouts on campus by football and basketball players, effective June 1.
   
 Other conferences are expected to follow suit, though decisions could be left to individual schools.
   
 "At this time, we are preparing to begin the fall sports season as currently scheduled, and this limited resumption of voluntary athletic activities on June 8 is an important initial step in that process," SEC Commissioner Greg Sankey said.
   
 SEC officials noted any workouts would take place "under strict supervision of designated university personnel and safety guidelines developed by each institution." They referred to June 8 as the start of "transition period that will allow student-athletes to gradually adapt to full training and sports activity after this recent period of inactivity."
   
 Permitted actions are limited by the NCAA to voluntary activities supervised by strength and conditioning personnel.
   
 "This is an important first step toward having a season this fall, and we will continue to collectively work together as our top priority is to ensure the safety and well-being of our student-athletes, coaches and staff," Auburn coach Gus Malzahn said in a statement.
   
 The SEC decided to resume athletic activities with the guidance of a league task force that includes public health, infectious disease and sports medicine professionals from each of the league's 14 member schools.
   
 The task force prepared a series of best practices for screening, testing, monitoring, tracing, social distancing and maintaining clean environments to serve as a guide for each school.
   
 Recommendations included testing of symptomatic team members (including athletes, coaches and staffers) as well as screening athletes before they arrive on campus within 72 hours of entering athletic facilities and on a daily basis once they resume athletic activities.
   
 Other recommendations include immediate isolation of team members who are diagnosed with COVID-19 or are under investigation, followed by contact tracing under Centers for Disease Control and local public health guidelines.
   
 "Health and safety have been our top priority as we've gone about this planning process, and we'll continue to follow guidance from medical experts and health officials as we navigate the coming weeks," Tennessee athletic director Phillip Fulmer said. "Our staff and student-athletes should be prepared for a 'new normal,' as we'll be implementing changes to how everyone accesses and uses our facilities."
   
 A Big 12 Conference moratorium on in-person team activities and voluntary workouts currently goes through May 31, a few days after spring meetings by leaders of the conference's 10 schools who have discussed options in bi-weekly calls since the pandemic outbreak shut down sports more than two months ago.
   
 Big 12 Commissioner Bob Bowlsby has said football teams would need six weeks or so to get ready to play, including some time for players to get reacclimated before a traditional preseason camp. Based on the current schedule for season openers on Labor Day weekend, that would mean teams would need to be back together by around mid-July.
   
 Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said Friday he thinks college football will return on schedule with at least some spectators. Abbott has already issued new rules to allow youth sports leagues to resume in June and for some professional leagues to hold events without spectators.
   
 "Once we get to college football season, our goal right now is to have college football season start as planned, with fans in stands," Abbott said in an interview with Austin television station KXAN. "What we don't know is what the capacity level would be."

Three days ago, there was another case in the State involving a little boy. Let us call him Moses. Moses was a one-year old boy found crying in a bush. Mercifully, he was rescued and taken to the palace of the King, who notified the police. The mother who abandoned him was found two days later. I will call her Mary. She had a sorry but familiar tale to tell. Grinding poverty. Abandonment. Frustration. Despair. The end result was the terrible decision to abandon her baby. Fortunately, Moses had a grandmother who cared. When Mary went back home to her mother without Moses, she claimed she had left him with one of her friends in a nearby town. Then a neighbor told Mama Mary that a one-year old baby had been found abandoned and the police were searching for the mother. Even though Mama Mary is willing to look after Moses even if his mother is unable to do so, it has been decided to keep Moses away from both of them for the time being, till when it can be ascertained that his life and well-being will not be at risk. This involves the necessary medical evaluations of his mother, addressing her psycho-social needs, her skills and livelihood options as well as her living arrangements and support systems.

In fact, by the time of the December 29 call, they’d already concluded there was such a dearth of evidence against Flynn that the Bureau needed to close the investigation they’d ludicrously opened against him four months earlier. I thus surmised that if it had been FBI agents who incidentally intercepted Flynn under FISA, they would have masked him, and thus there would have been an unmasking record (which there isn’t). This seemed especially so in light of former director Jim Comey’s strenuous claims in sworn testimony about how seriously the FBI takes it minimization duties. (“I also want to assure the committee that we take very seriously that obligation to protect U.S. persons’ privacy. This applies to all stages of the production of foreign intelligence, but I'd like to emphasize one area in particular; the dissemination of U.S. person information . . .”).

"We expect it will be Californians to hit the road, rediscover their state and drive economic recovery."

Like Nemechek, who is currently ranking 22nd in points standings, rookie Tyler Reddick placed in the top-10 for the first time this season. Reddick, ranked 20th in points, finished in seventh after racing from a 29th-place start.
 Kenseth said he watched back-to-back Xfinity Series champion Reddick race in last year’s Xfinity championship at Homestead-Miami, and called Reddick the “difference-maker.”
 “A lot of times, everybody is pretty good when you get to this level,” Kenseth said. “But when I watched Homestead, he’s just incredibly talented. Especially at tracks where you have to run high.”
 Reddick, the No. 8 Chevrolet driver, received high praise from another NASCAR veteran, Dale Earnhardt Jr.
 “He continues to amaze me,” Earnhardt Jr. said. “ ... He’s not making these rookie mistakes that are taking him out of the running, especially at a place like Darlington where it’s easy.”
 Reddick has always been a highly touted rookie name in the Cup Series, along with last year’s top Xfinity finishers, Cole Custer and Christopher Bell, who make up the “Big Three” of the rookie class. Sunday, Custer (ranked 24th in points) finished 22nd, and Bell (32nd in points) finished 24th.
 Those three, in addition to Nemechek, who started 34th on a grid of 40 drivers and raced his way into the top-10, are proving they can compete with best, even driving for smaller, less well-funded teams. The rookie class will likely continue to shine as drivers’ comfort and confidence grows with each return race on the biggest stage of their individual careers.
 While names like Harvick, Johnson and Kenseth have long been in the “best of NASCAR” conversation, 2020 is proving we could soon see names like Reddick, Nemechek and Bell in the same sentence.

Even though we may not be able to gather as we normally would, citizens across Wyoming and this great country will find ways to remember, pay tribute and give thanks to those who have made such great sacrifices on our behalf. Flags will fly on residential streets, glasses will be raised and some tears will be shed. We must always remember that our freedom is not free. Freedom carries a very high price.
 And it is worth paying. As Rudyard Kipling noted so eloquently, “All we have of freedom, all we use or know – This our fathers bought for us long and long ago.”
 There is no doubt we have our troubles today. But I, for one, feel blessed to live in this wonderful country, and am thankful for the glorious freedoms and rights that every American is guaranteed – life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
 And I am thankful to the countless men and women who have given so much, many that last full measure of devotion, to pay for the freedom we all enjoy.
 In the book of John, Jesus said that, “Greater love has no man than this, that he lay his life down for his friend.”
 It is right that we, as free people, pause to take stock of that price on Memorial Day, and honor the memories of those who have paid it for us – those selfless heroes who have laid down their lives for us and something greater than themselves. Wyoming, indeed, remembers.

Scott Schiller, NBCUniversal’s executive VP, digital, advertising sales, closed out the 2015 Advanced Advertising summit with a keynote conversation with _B &C_ editor Jon Lafayette.                                                                                   The NBCU exec pointed towards the company’s focus on offering a “total audience solution” for its prospective clients and partners. After introducing vertical portfolios broken up into lifestyle, entertainment, live content, which is news and sports, and Hispanic programming, “we created a client solutions group to deal with top clients and [also] as an overall research organization,” said Schiller _._ “What we found was that we were able to have larger, more important conversations with clients and we’re in the throes of that right now,” he continued pointing to the upfront presentations on the horizon.                                                                                    This fully unified approach was put into gear after Comcast acquired NBCUniversal, which previously had many separately functioning businesses. “We sought out the integration of a system which would allow us to both offer a total approach to clients during and before negotiations so people can see schedules and understand what they’re buying,” said Schiller  “But at the same time it allows us to optimize schedules over time and on the fly.”                                                                                   NBCU is applying its all-inclusive strategy to social, which Schiller believes will eventually mesh into one media buying group along with programmatic and mobile, to ad sales. “Clients want our content, but they also want to be able to take advantage of social platforms,” said Schiller  “We bring to the table packages that include the distribution of content from tweets and handles that we control, allowing us to market social media with the television content."                                                                                   The executive VP also spoke about CNBC’s move away from Nielsen ratings saying, “what we found over time working with Nielsen, was that their data didn’t necessarily articulate the audience that was there,” referring to the mass viewing off of a single TV set in trading and news rooms. “So we went out and found a firm called Cogent, which is known on Wall Street for its accuracy as a dairy based mechanism… We’re not afraid to make those decisions because we think it shows the true value of our product.”

McDONOUGH COUNTY -- Downed or fallen power lines may become an all-too-common sight as inclement weather threatens to leave McDonough County mopping up another stormy spring.
   
 Although Western Illinois appears to be dodging the bullet this weekend as storm fronts bring heavy rain and tornadoes into the southern plains, Ameren Illinois representatives Brian Bretsch and Daetta Jones wanted to inform readers about how Ameren prepares and executes their disaster response initiatives when bad weather blackouts strike.
   
 Ameren Illinois' overhead system, such as power lines and other above-ground facilities, make up a service territory with a square footage comparable to the state of Indiana, Bretsch said. Bretsch, spokesman for Ameren Illinois, said the electric grid consists of 50,000 miles of overhead, and 1.3 million power poles. When inclement weather strikes, any one of these poles or segments of overhead wire is susceptible to damage that can not only knock out the power in a customer's home, but threaten nearby property or wildlife as live wires come loose.
   
 When a tree falls on a line in a customer's neighborhood, or a passing driver sees that lightning has damaged one of these power poles, Jones said it's important that they call Ameren at 800-755-5000. This same number should also be used by those who have critical electrical equipment in their home such as oxygen machines, dialysis devices, or other medical tools of that sort. This way, Ameren can prioritize giving these customers advanced notice when a repair may take longer than usual, and allow them to make preparations ahead of time.
   
 Jones, senior director of Ameren Illinois' northern operations division, said interacting with any sort of downed element of the electric grid is an incredibly dangerous operation, and even a mundane incident like a fallen branch can be lethal if a resident tries to clear it themselves.
   
 While quick-reporting is important to ensure the fastest response time, Jones also made it clear that Ameren's response teams are prepared to act before the first drop has fallen. Thanks to a weather monitoring service Ameren contracts, Jones said the first sign of bad weather gives the company time to alert repair and restoration crews throughout the region, including some outside agencies contracted by Ameren.
   
 "We have a very robust storm plan that we follow," Jones said. "We actually alert all of our personnel, our field crews, and our support people so that they're on alert and they're getting their equipment and their trucks all fueled and ready to go."
   
 From there, Jones said their communication protocols kick in, which follow a level of organization comparable to a military operation, coordinating with first responders in the affected communities. She credited Ameren's Emergency Operations Center (EOC) for the company's ability to organize and fluidly execute these repairs and processes.
   
 Response times are often quick, Jones said, but some issues can be severe enough to make immediate restoration almost impossible, such as when a substation is flooded. In this case, she said nearby portions of the power grid can be rerouted to the affected area using a mobile substation, which can be brought in and made operable far quicker than the permanent substation can be repaired. Weather conditions also cause the nature of the response to vary significantly, Jones said. Neutralizing the threat of a free-hanging wire on a windy day is far easier than reaching a flooded facility, which she said Ameren technicians have done before using boats to get its technicians on site.
   
 Over the last 15 years, Jones said Ameren has significantly improved its customer service, including a new notification system where customers can now be readily informed of the cause of their local outage, and how long it's expected to last. This information can be dispersed to customers who sign up for alerts via email, text, or phone. Jones said this info is dispersed as soon as linemen arrive on the scene, and are able to provide a safe assessment of the situation.

McDONOUGH COUNTY -- The McDonough County Historical Society will be canceling all meetings for the remainder of 2020. This decision was made in light of the uncertainty surrounding COVID-19.
   
 According to a statement issued by Larry Zigler, the president of the McDonough County Historical Society, the speaker originally planned for September has agreed to reschedule for 2021. The Historical Society is currently planning its speakers for next year.
   
 "In order to counter our tendency to be Macomb focused, we might think of people with expertise related to our outlying McDonough County area who would be willing to come at the end of next year to talk to us," said Zigler.
   
 Dues paid during 2020 will be applied to 2021 membership; for current members, no membership dues will be collected for the 2021 calendar year.
   
 Due to the November meeting, in which officers are typically elected for the coming year, no longer being held, the terms of all current officers and board members will extend to the end of 2021.
   
 Zigler encourages individuals interested in becoming membership chair for 2021 to reach out to him.
   
 Additionally, all future January meetings will not be held. This is due to the bad weather that contributes to consistent low attendance and not to concerns surrounding COVID-19, Zigler clarified.
   
 Due to the closure of Western Illinois University in light of the pandemic, no newsletter has been produced since the Winter 2020 issue. However, a new issue will reportedly be sent out during the summer or fall. The size of this newsletter will depend upon the degree to which WIU has opened back up and how accessible materials in the Archives will be.
   
 The McDonough County Historical Society is a not-for-profit organization that promotes the history and heritage of McDonough County. The Historical Society offers free historical programming four times a year, produces the McDonough County Historical Society Newsletter, leads historical tours, sponsors the Local History Day, and coordinates the identification and marking of historic cemeteries.
   
 According to the group's website, past meeting topics have included Marty Fischer presenting "A New Look at French Peoria During the War of 1812", Peter Cole presenting "The Chicago Race Riots of 1919", and John Hallwas presenting "Compton Park: Macomb's Celebrated Subdivision Beautiful."

I'm not sure how many people realize the local level of organization that has gone into our McDonough County battle against the COVID-19 virus.
   
 There have been three separate emergency operations centers established. One is at the McDonough County Health Department, one is at McDonough District Hospital, and the McDonough County EOC has been established at Western Illinois University.
   
 Key personnel at each one also attend meetings at the two others. The constant planning or exchange of information is an effort not to leave out any aspect of what needs to be done.
   
 We owe much of what we have to two people, Lynette Cale and Edgar Rodriguez. As county health administrator, Cale has done her research and has maintained key state contacts. County Emergency Services Director Rodriguez seems joined at the hip with FEMA and its state IEMA counterpart and has brought training and supplies to our county.
   
 A FEMA-sponsored incident command exercise at McDonough District Hospital brought Brian Dietz and Wanda Foster into the picture. By the following week they had their team organized and operating.
   
 Cale said that the first month involved a lot of planning and state and federal coordination at the emergency operations centers. She said the centers are now more in response mode, exchanging information and acting on it.
   
 The real world can turn planning on its head. Dietz said much money was spent equipping the hospital to handle 40 to 60 COVID-19 cases. They have had two so far. It turns out that most victims have been able to quarantine at home.
   
 But MDH, the health department, and the county emergency services agency are well equipped for the predicted "second wave" of COVID-19 in the fall. More socialization in the next few months may make this more severe.
   
 I got to see the city and county emergency operations center during a Zoom meeting this week. With no ongoing activities there, WIU has repurposed a section of Spencer Recreation Center for county use.
   
 With university assistance and the help of WIU emergency management students, Rodriguez is hoping to make the EOC a permanent presence on campus.

"This virus really likes people being indoors in an enclosed space for prolonged periods of close face-to-face contact," William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University, told Business Insider. Still, it's people congregating in groups where risk is highest, he said, hence the need for access to services in neighborhoods where people live, helping them avoid bottlenecks like transit where exposure could occur.

                                                                          Many were caught unaware by a long term confinement after the lockdown was announced. But here we are, for more than two months, we are in each other’s space and company at home.                                        Claire Mugisha says her marriage nearly hit a dead end. “Home had turned into a war zone. We quarrelled even at the pettiest of issues. At some point, I even wondered why I chose to spend the rest of my life with the man I call my husband,” she narrates.                                        “We eventually had to openly talk about our marital issues in order to find a solution,” she says. Just like Mugisha, many couples are at not at good terms. Last month, when China lifted the lockdown, many couples were filing for divorce and many relationships ended. Many couples are finding it difficult to accommodate their spouses.                                                                           In her story about why you shouldn’t give up on your marriage, Lady Justice Catherine Bamugemereire revealed how divorce cases in the family court have skyrocketed during lockdown yet the stability of the nation is most of the times guaranteed by the stability of marriages and family as a unit.                                        She says: “It is important you realise that marriage is an area of your life that you need to work on. Marriages are not something you enter into and assume that ‘you have arrived. You have to work on your marriage the same way you to tend a garden. You have got to work at your relationship everyday.”                                                                          “Why are relationships breaking down? It is because people stopped working on them. They stopped communicating. They stopped showing love. They stopped showing the other that this is how I love you. They don’t have any love language. Many do not take time to build their relationships, and often times realize too late that the person they left actually loved them and vice versa,” says Bamugemerire.                                       Evelyn Connie Kharono Lufafa, a relationship counsellor affiliated to Talk Therapy Uganda, says when a man and woman start to date, they need little effort to keep the spark in their relationship, especially during the first two years. However, because of the changes that set in after some years, each spouse needs to work towards maintaining a healthy relationship.                                                                           Kharono advises couples to use this lockdown and talk through their marital or relationship issues. “We must agree that the lockdown has had a bearing on marriage. And due to anxiety, couples are tempted to turn against each other. Difference in roles of a man at home and those of the woman and the expectations that both have towards each other are to blame for the friction,” she shares.                                       But amidst this crisis, how can love and peace abound? Kharono shares ways to restore lost love among couples.                                       “Value time spent with each other as a couple, where you are not interrupted by busy schedules such as dropping and picking of children from school. Reflect upon the early years of your relationship. What attracted you to your spouse? What memories you have shared as a couple?” Kharono wonders.                                                                          According Kharono, most people come into relationships with a zillion expectations and they end up getting disappointed in the long run. “Lower your expectations and learn be content with less. Your spouse is not a super natural human being. He is bound to make mistakes,” she says.                                        Communication is the lifeline of any relationship, so Kharono advises couples to make an effort to communicate as much as possible. “Engage in an activity that you both enjoy as a couple for instance watching a movie, indoor exercise, praying together in case you are both Christians,” she says.                                                                           She says couples should look at the lockdown as a protection tool against the deadly disease. Accept what you cannot change and support each other as this will increase love in your marriage during this lockdown.                                        When you feel pressured, remember you cannot change the situation but you can only change how you react. Focus more on the positive attributes of your partner since the negative ones only lead to resentment and ruining of the marriage. Be intentional to enjoy the best in your spouse during this lockdown and leave a lasting effect that will be carried on even after.

Arts people, as a rule, get news from the _New York Times_ , Rachel Maddow, CNN, and _Vox_ -- we all know the ilk -- so, as a rule, they’re blinkered. I hope in writing about COVID-19 to offer some nuggets contrary to the received wisdom. Arts venues, especially theaters, are going to be asked to make lots of changes, many, I suppose, giving their viability a fatal beating. Theaters of all kinds, for instance, engage audiences. That’s the financial, aesthetic, and pedagogical model from the days of Homer.

In a recent column, I wrote about people turning towards religion and faith in these difficult times. At the same time, there are those who are suffering new doubts. I heard an interview recently with a pastor who was questioning present realities and asking “Where is God?”                                                                                  Maybe we can begin by asking where God is not. Some people insist that this pandemic is like the punishment of the Egyptians in the biblical plagues or, as medieval people also claimed, the anger of God coming down on a sinful world. These claims don’t make much sense unless you believe in an angry and vengeful God who just likes to wipe out massive numbers of innocent people to get at the bad ones who might be among them. Jesus, in the gospel of Luke, chapter 13, is asked about the sin of the people who were killed in an accident where a tower fell at Siloam. This must have been a news event on his listeners’ minds, like tragedies of our own times.                                                                                  His response is to say that these people weren’t any worse than anyone else. He goes on to say everyone should just look to their own sins. If God made the world to function on its own, then sometimes things are bound to go wrong. We have almost all prayed for someone who was ill and they died anyway, or prayed for a certain good thing to happen and it didn’t. Mature people of faith know that the world is much more complicated than just having everything work out the way I want it to, every time and in every way.                                                                                  What God does say is that whatever happens, we can hang on in strength and trust. There is a popular meme on the internet that claims that the bible says “Do not be afraid,” or some variation on that sentiment, exactly 365 times. Of course, those who have attempted to verify this haven’t been able to get anywhere near that number. But it is there often enough to show us that God really wants us not to be fearful. It is summed up well in Isaiah, where God says “Do not be afraid, for I have redeemed you; I have called you by name; you are Mine.”                                                                                  As for Jesus, he says several times “Do not be afraid” in real situations like in a boat on a stormy sea. Certainly many people feel like they’re on a stormy sea, tossing and turning, right now.                                                                                  That does not mean that we just throw caution to the wind and are never afraid of anything. The same God says to love your neighbor as yourself. Statistics on the pandemic have shown us how easily we can endanger others and how small acts of care or carelessness affect a wide circle. God wants us to set aside paralyzing fear that keeps us from doing the right thing, or fear that causes us to turn on others with bigotry or aggressive violence, not fear of a devastating virus or fear of the effects of war or climate change.                                                                                  While Jesus tries to instill courage in his disciples in his lifetime, his message changes somewhat after he conquers death. Three times after his resurrection, but not before, he says “Peace be with you!” Now he can assure them in a new way that, although there are plenty of stormy seas of which they might still be afraid, he can promise them some peace in their hearts. The last thing he says before his ascension is “Know that I am with you always.” So where is God in everything you might be feeling right now, whether it’s sadness from losses or joy from the hope of better days to come? God is where God always is: right with you.

The Flynn–Kislyak call was intercepted because the FBI had FISA coverage on Kislyak, and both the Bureau and the Obama White House instantly recognized that hyping the call could advance all these objectives. Then, they really hit the jackpot: Even though Flynn had done nothing wrong, Trump officials amateurishly misled the public about the call -- claiming that Obama’s sanctions were not discussed, rather than that the topic came up but Flynn made no concessions to Moscow. This, naturally, stoked a few “Flynn discussed the sanctions, then lied” news cycles. These amplified the frenzy over publication of the Steele dossier -- choreographed by Obama-administration leaks about the Russia briefing our intelligence agencies gave Trump. Flynn’s days were numbered. By Valentine’s Day, he was cashiered as national-security advisor . . . no longer an obstacle to the Obama-driven strategy of continuing the Trump–Russia investigation after Trump took office.

Once lockdowns are lifted, people are going to need to get around, and they may opt for micromobility as their preferred means of transportation. Uber's CEO thinks that will be the case, calling it a "critical part of the urban landscape." Demand for eScooters had been waning ahead of the pandemic, and in the long run, they may not make a feasible alternative in inclement weather. But for now, micromobility may see renewed interest among jittery consumers who'd rather not be cooped up in an enclosed space with other people.

Liverpool chairman Tom Werner accepts the club made a mistake when they announced plans to use the government's furlough scheme.
 The Premier League leaders faced huge criticism in early April when owners Fenway Sports Group revealed they planned to take advantage of the coronavirus job retention scheme, which would see the United Kingdom government cover 80 per cent of wages up to £2,500 per month.
 There was a backlash from fans and former players given the club had announced pre-tax profits of £42million just six weeks earlier, leading them to reverse their decision and issue an apology through chief executive Peter Moore.
 "It's better to admit a mistake than to dig your heels in," said Werner, as per the Daily Mail.
 "Hopefully, people will know that all we really care about is trying to support the fans and support our players and our club in a way that is sustainable.
 "It's a terrible situation we're all in. Someday, hopefully, there will be a vaccine and we can return to the joy of being in a stadium and watching the elegant play of great football players.
 "The most important thing is safety and the Premier League are working on protocols. But there's a hole in so many people's lives. Football is central to their dreams and their hopes.
 "Certainly, as regards to Liverpool, we are playing magnificent football and we are just a couple of matches away from winning the trophy. But I do put it in perspective."
 Premier League matches are not expected to resume until some time in June and will have to be held behind closed doors.
 Similarly, plans for a victory parade should Liverpool end their 30-year wait to win the top-flight title have been ruined by the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Werner still hopes to be able to celebrate such a triumph with fans when it is safe to do so, having been inspired by the scenes after last season's Champions League success.
 "The 4-0 win over Barcelona [in the semi-final second leg] was the single greatest sporting event I've ever seen," he said. "The reaction our supporters had in the stadium that day and around the world is something that I'll remember for the rest of my life.
 "I thought I could never imagine experiencing anything like [the parade]. Then somebody said, 'Well, if we win the Premier League, this parade will be dwarfed'. I'm looking forward to a parade when we can all congregate again."

A monthly jobs report from the South Carolina Department of Employment and Workforce released early Friday provides the first full look at how the COVID-19 outbreak has affected jobs in the state, industry by industry and county by county.
   
 The number of South Carolinians working had hit an all time high of 2.3 million in March, according to the state's employment agency. But in April that number fell to 2,089,889.
   
 That's a decline of 238,000 workers. Unemployment estimates increased in that same time frame by 211,000 people, SCDEW reported.
   
 By industry, the hardest hit in April were:
   
 - Leisure and hospitality, down 125,300 jobs from the month before,
   
 - Professional and business services, down 40,700,
   
 - Education and health services, down 27,700 jobs, and
   
 - Trade, transportation and utilities, down 27,900 jobs
   
 Manufacturing, a mainstay of the Upstate, lost 12,900 jobs statewide. No industries, SCDEW reported, had job gains. These figures are seasonally adjusted.
   
 The report covers April. Businesses started shutting down in response to the outbreak in mid-March.
   
 Typically released the third week of every month, the report from the Department of Employment and Workforce provides localized results of a nationwide survey of 60,000 households and 40,000 employers by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
   
 Unemployment fund declines sharply
   
 Among the biggest concern for policy makers has been the health of the state's unemployment insurance fund, which stood at $1.1 billion at the end of February, according to U.S. Treasury records.
   
 The state withdrew $223 million from April 12 to May 9 to pay benefits to workers, according to data provided to USA Today Network-South Carolina.
   
 At that rate, the fund could be depleted by fall.
   
 The maximum weekly benefit South Carolina workers receive is $326, with an extra $600 kicked in from the federal government through the CARES Act.
   
 South Carolina Department of Employment and Workforce Chief of Staff Jamie Suber said his agency monitors the state's unemployment insurance trust fund "daily." The goal, he said, is to shorten the time people are claiming unemployment benefits so that money is still there for people least able to find work. State law allows claims for up to 20 weeks. The extra CARES Act money covers those same workers an additional 13 weeks.
   
 "Now that the state is starting to reopen, business are starting to have the desire to hire and bring back or recall their employees, we want to work with the businesses and those job seekers and get them back to work," Suber said. "That alone will allow the draw on the unemployment insurance trust fund to be minimal."
   
 He said he is encouraged by the decline in new jobless claims. This means the number of workers claiming unemployment benefits has started to plateau. Still, the agency must contend with workers who remain on the unemployment rolls week after week -- a number that reached nearly 270,000 in South Carolina last week, according to the Department of Labor Statistics.
   
 SCDEW agency spokeswoman Heather Biance said that with thousands of workers coming on and off unemployment benefits from week to week, data is not completely reliable in real time. However, the agency does know that it has received more than half a million -- 515,595 -- initial claims for unemployment insurance since the pandemic began.
   
 Whole industries have ground to a halt, including South Carolina's small film industry. Camera operator Barret Burlage of Charleston said he does not expect productions to pick back up until September and he is trying to ride out the COVID-19 crisis without seeking work elsewhere. Burlage has been in the film industry for about 12 years.
   
 "You invest so much time and effort in a skill set, it's like everybody is going to do what they're going to have to do, but I and many many other people around the country and the world are waiting to see what happens," Burlage said.
   
 Burlage is collecting benefits from SCDEW under the federal CARES Act, which is covering self-employed and freelance workers with a $600 weekly check. These workers are not eligible for state benefits. One challenge for Burlage and other freelancers has been the additional processing time -- more than a month for many -- that the federal program has taken to navigate.
   
 South Carolina workers covered by the state's unemployment insurance program have had to wait, on average, about 21 days, Suber said.

Since marrying in 2002, Doug Behan and Lise Deguire have gone on safari in Tanzania, watched the sunset over the Santorini caldera in the Greek Islands and walked through the ruins of Machu Picchu in Peru.      And those are just a few of their annual excursions. "It's on my bucket list that I want to visit every continent," Deguire said.      Early this year, the Yardley, Pennsylvania, couple began planning a 12-day trip to Japan in March. But then news of COVID-19 began saturating the airwaves. By February, the couple made the difficult decision to cancel, instead booking a one-week trip to New Mexico. As the virus continued to spread even more, they nixed that, too, replacing it with a three-day retreat at a local spa.      But on March 19, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf ordered all non-life- sustaining businesses to close their physical locations.      "That was pretty devastating," Deguire said. "Travel makes me feel very alive, like living on the edge in a way that's exciting and fulfilling."      It's not just tourists who are canceling trips. North Carolina's Outer Banks set up checkpoints to greet visitors, temporarily barring non-permanent residents and those without an entry permit. It's one of several resort communities around the country, including Key West and California's Mono County, which requested visitors stay away - sacrificing vital tourism dollars in an effort to keep out COVID-19.      That's in line with recommendations by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which recommends people stay at home as much as possible and to avoid travel altogether, especially when sick.      The unprecedented travel restrictions may take a toll, said James Petrick, a professor, research fellow and the associate department head for graduate studies in the department of recreation, parks and tourism sciences at Texas A&M; University in College Station.      "We know that we learn much more when we're experiencing new things, and relationships are stronger when a couple travels together," he said. "The benefits that we receive when we travel don't just exist on vacation. They exist afterward and embed themselves in our existence."      Indeed, a number of studies have shown that even planning for a vacation makes people happier.      Not to mention the health benefits.      A 2000 trial that tracked middle-aged men for nine years found those who take an annual vacation were less likely to die from heart attacks and other cardiovascular-related issues. And women who vacation regularly were found in a 1992 study to be less likely to have a heart attack or coronary death than those who did so less often.      That makes sense to Petrick. "If I travel somewhere and come back, I'm less stressed than I was before."      And stress can impact health and wellbeing in many ways. According to Dr. Anand Rohatgi, a preventive cardiologist and associate professor of medicine at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, chronic stress can flood the body with compounds called catecholamines, which include so-called stress hormones like adrenaline.      "If you're always having increased catecholamines in your system, it can lead to high blood pressure, worse metabolism and worsening of inflammation in your body," Rohatgi said. "Over time, that can lead to more plaques in your arteries, heart attacks and strokes.      "Whatever your environment is, if it's stressful, taking a break from it can improve heart health," he added.      Both Petrick and Rohatgi said to achieve the greatest effect, the vacation should be distinctly different from one's day-to-day environment - especially the stressful parts. That means, for one, fighting the temptation to check work emails.      "It's important to relax and not have to think about things that add to stress - how am I going to pay the bills, work responsibilities and perhaps even caretaking responsibilities," Rohatgi said. "You want to be in a place where that burden is lifted."      In a time when travel is all but restricted, however, what should people do to achieve those benefits?      Rohatgi recommends people get out and explore new parks and trails, visit new areas in the community and develop new hobbies. Setting aside time to be alone also is important.      "Read a book, listen to music, and build in a couple of times per day where you can go outside and take a walk," he said.      Petrick advises people to get creative about how they vary their routine. One idea is to take a drive and allow a literal roll of the dice to determine which way to turn at each intersection.      "When we get outside of our usual environment, the brain is much more active," he said. "If you are staycationing, you have to find a way to make it novel."      Doug Behan and Lise Deguire have taken that to heart.      For example, during a recent "Lord of the Rings" viewing party with their two college-age daughters and a friend who is staying with them, the entire family dressed up as the characters from the movie, repurposing old rings, reimagining a pair of scissors as a sword and turning old clothes into hobbit capes and elf crowns.   "It was a hoot," Deguire said.      But she admits it's not quite as exciting as getting away. The entire clan was scheduled to depart on a Canadian cruise in August, but in late April, Deguire canceled that, too.      "Everyone is pretty sad about that, but we hope to reschedule," she said. "Travel memories are really bonding and important for us as a couple and a family."

Corporations are legal fictions recognized by law as "persons" that act through authorized agents, normally a board of directors. Actions outside the corporate authority are called "Ultra Vires," a Latin term meaning "outside the powers." In business corporations, officers often act as the primary agents, but in HOAs, the primary decision-maker is the board. If an officer acts outside those powers and without board approval, it is not corporate action.

 I'm not sure how many people realize the local level of organization that has gone into our McDonough County battle against the COVID-19 virus.
 There have been three separate emergency operations centers established. One is at the McDonough County Health Department, one is at McDonough District Hospital, and the McDonough County EOC has been established at Western Illinois University.
 Key personnel at each one also attend meetings at the two others. The constant planning or exchange of information is an effort not to leave out any aspect of what needs to be done.
 We owe much of what we have to two people, Lynette Cale and Edgar Rodriguez. As county health administrator, Cale has done her research and has maintained key state contacts. County Emergency Services Director Rodriguez seems joined at the hip with FEMA and its state IEMA counterpart and has brought training and supplies to our county.
 A FEMA-sponsored incident command exercise at McDonough District Hospital brought Brian Dietz and Wanda Foster into the picture. By the following week they had their team organized and operating.
 Cale said that the first month involved a lot of planning and state and federal coordination at the emergency operations centers. She said the centers are now more in response mode, exchanging information and acting on it.
 The real world can turn planning on its head. Dietz said much money was spent equipping the hospital to handle 40 to 60 COVID-19 cases. They have had two so far. It turns out that most victims have been able to quarantine at home.
 But MDH, the health department, and the county emergency services agency are well equipped for the predicted \"second wave\" of COVID-19 in the fall. More socialization in the next few months may make this more severe.
 I got to see the city and county emergency operations center during a Zoom meeting this week. With no ongoing activities there, WIU has repurposed a section of Spencer Recreation Center for county use.
 With university assistance and the help of WIU emergency management students, Rodriguez is hoping to make the EOC a permanent presence on campus.

By my calculations, IIP would need to buy and lease between six and eight new properties each year while keeping its dividend payout at least at current levels to double an initial investment within the next five years. The company has completed eight sale-leaseback deals so far this year. I don't think it's out of the question at all for IIP to turn a $5,000 investment into $30,000 or more over the next 10 years.

In a CLT, the property is transferred to a trust you create that provides an annual payment to a charity for a specific term, with the remainder being paid to the named non-charitable beneficiary at the end of the term. You can get a charitable income tax deduction immediately, which is based on the value of the asset transferred to the trust, less the presumed value of what will remain in the trust at the term’s end thereby passing on to the non-charitable beneficiary.

As businesses enter Phase 1 of Gov. John Bel Edwards' reopening plan and residents venture out in larger numbers, some are considering thermographic cameras as one tool to combat the spread of the novel coronavirus. But the technology isn't foolproof.
   
 Pam DeVille, Cajundome and Convention Center director, spoke to the Lafayette City Council about the Cajundome's plans Tuesday, noting the venue is working with Acadian Total Security on installation of thermal cameras at entrances as part of its pandemic protocol. She estimated the cameras would cost $75,000 and is seeking financial assistance to cover the costs as events continue to cancel.
   
 DeVille said the Cajundome needs to reopen or there will be dire financial consequences for the venue. To do that, people need to feel confident attending events.
   
 "If they're afraid to go in the building because they think the person that sneezes next to them is going to give them COVID, they're never going to come back," she said.
   
 Casey White, Cajundome marketing director, said the proposal's affordability will play a role in whether it's executable, but said the cameras are an attractive option. She noted other venues in the industry are using or considering the technology and the Cajundome is monitoring those efforts.
   
 While not perfect, the thermal cameras can offer a sense of comfort and security, she said.
   
 "It's one extra step that makes people feel comfortable coming here for the time being. We want them to be as comfortable as possible coming into this environment, and if this will help achieve that, it's what we'll try to do," she said.
   
 Acadian Total Security is rolling out thermographic imaging services to interested clients to "protect customers and employees from COVID-19." The technology claims to scan the face of anyone entering the vicinity and detect elevated skin-surface temperatures. If an above-average temperature is found, an alarm notifies the business owner so further screening can be done, Acadian said in a release.
   
 Jason Brown, Acadian Total Security sales and marketing director, said at least 100 different companies have reached out to explore the camera options. Before, Acadian mainly sold related technology to chemical companies who needed to monitor thermal readings in plants or similar facilities.
   
 "It's a huge spike. We have been absolutely slammed with meetings and I've got commercial sales reps flying across the country and meeting with businesses from hospitals, to senior communities, to schools, government, courthouses. Every avenue that you can think of has reached out in one capacity or another," he said.
   
 Acadian carries lines from three thermal camera manufacturers - FLIR Systems, HikVision and BraveWatch - with prices ranging from roughly $7,000 per camera to $70,000, depending if customers want a tripod arrangement or a more sophisticated mounted camera system, he said.
   
 Acadian markets their cameras as achieving an accuracy within a range of between .5 and .9 degrees Fahrenheit, depending on the system. The cameras can scan up to 14 people in about one second, a faster contactless method than having someone scan customers at the door with a handheld thermometer, Brown said.
   
 Some of the cameras are U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved, while others aren't, though the FDA eased guidelines on the use and marketing of thermographic systems for the duration of the pandemic. However, the FDA did say the cameras should be used to measure only one person at a time, among other qualifications, to be used effectively.
   
 Customers have discretion to set temperature alarm parameters and control how the data is stored, what data is stored and for what duration, Brown said. Most of the camera systems operate independently of an internet connection and should not be capable of outside data transmission, a security measure Brown said he's assured clients of.
   
 There are some caveats about the use of thermal cameras, especially as protection against spreading COVID-19.
   
 The technology isn't intended to diagnose illness or prevent the spread of disease. Several thermal camera companies, including FLIR Systems, have released disclaimers that their products aren't intended to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus and can't be used to find COVID-19 infected individuals.
   
 One reason is that not all novel coronavirus infected patients have a fever. In a study conducted across New York City area hospitals, one of the U.S. cities hit hardest by COVID-19, doctors found that only 30.7% of 5,700 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 had a fever when triaged.
   
 Further, not all novel coronavirus patients exhibit symptoms, but asymptomatic carriers are still able to spread the virus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The total number of asymptomatic carriers is undetermined, but CDC Director Robert Redfield told NPR in March the number could be as high as 25% of COVID-19 infected individuals.
   
 The American Civil Liberties Union issued a report Tuesday challenging the use of thermal cameras to track fever and prevent novel coronavirus spread. In the report, the group questioned the cameras' reported accuracy and raised concerns about the risks to post-pandemic privacy should body temperature surveillance become normalized.
   
 "The bottom line is that nobody should imagine that blanketing our public spaces with thermal sensors is going to serve as any kind of effective automated 'COVID detection network,' or that this technology is likely to contribute significantly to stemming the spread of the virus," the ACLU report said.
   
 Using thermal cameras isn't flawless, Brown said. But it's an option that provides businesses some level of oversight and control.
   
 "I'm seeing companies trying their best to keep everyone safe and I applaud the ones that are looking into this and are at least trying to do something to help protect people. It's not foolproof because there are people who can carry it without a temperature, but it's a step in the right direction while people try to open their businesses," Brown said.
   
 It's also one way to follow reopening guidelines as governments at various levels recommend businesses test employees' temperatures during reopening, as well as customers' when possible.
   
 Brown said Acadian is advising all clients to partner the thermal scanners with secondary screening procedures when someone with an elevated temperature is detected, a recommendation echoed by the FDA. The individual should be pulled aside, have their temperature checked with a thermometer or other device and they should be asked standard novel coronavirus screening questions, he said.
   
 Acadian Companies is partnering with interested customers to have EMTs from sister branch Acadian Ambulance on site to perform secondary scans and evaluations. DeVille mentioned they're looking at the Acadian Ambulance partnership to manage screenings at their events.
   
 Camera users should also continue diligent sanitation and other protective measures, Brown said.

TORRINGTON -- In response to a growing concern about a food supply chain crisis in Connecticut and nationwide, The Northwest CT Food Hub is partnering with restaurants statewide to offer unique food shares directly to consumers. Similar to a traditional CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) the Food HUB is now providing restaurants with locally-sourced, nutrient-dense food options from over 30 farms in CT's northwest region, including: honey, maple syrup, eggs and produce. Restaurants can contribute to the boxes uniquely with items that are a specialty to that restaurant. Customers can sign-up with the restaurants to pick-up their share. Prices vary per location and add-ons.

Sherburne County Commissioner Lisa Fobbe has filed to run for a second term on the Sherburne County Board of Commissioners.
 Fobbe, who resides in Princeton, has been a resident of the county for almost 24 years. She is finishing her first term as the District 5 representative.
 “Each day serving as a commissioner affords an opportunity to make a difference in someone’s life,” said Fobbe in announcing her filing on May 19. “Whether you are at a neighbor’s kitchen table discussing a land issue or down at the state Capitol meeting with area legislators advocating for the county, the ability to influence positive change is considerable.”
 During her first term, Fobbe has served on, or been the liaison to, many local boards and committees as expected by each commissioner. Included are Great River Regional Library, Central MN Jobs and Services, East Central Regional Juvenile Center, Tri-CAP, Sherburne County Substance Abuse Coalition, Sherburne County Soil and Water, as well as the Princeton and St. Cloud airports. On the state level, Fobbe serves on the Minnesota Inter-county Association (MICA) Board of Directors. Most recently, being recognized for her influence and leadership, Fobbe was appointed to the Association of Minnesota Counties Blue Ribbon Committee, charged with examining lessons learned about county government operations during the COVID-19 emergency.
 “I am most proud of my ability to bring people together and build coalitions across all jurisdictions to serve the local community,” said Fobbe. “It’s also essential to support the work of our great staff by providing a visionary framework that ensures that Sherburne County is a great place to live, learn and work.”
 Fobbe most recently worked as a ministry coordinator for Christ Our Light Catholic Community. Independent of her county work she also serves on the Princeton Pantry as well as the Central Minnesota Mental Health Board. She is a proud mother of three grown sons and three grandsons.

In what will likely spread like wildfire throughout the marketing departments of cable, satellite TV and telco TV distributors nationwide, a focus group report conducted by Sanford Bernstein media analyst Todd Juenger shows what they have suspected all along –  when faced with the reality of severing their pay TV subscription, cord cutters don’t want to cut the cord.                                                                                  Juenger held the first of what will be a series of focus groups in New York on March 12, and according to his report, the key finding was this: “none of these at-risk cord-cutters is likely to cut the cord.”                                                                                  Other focus groups are planned for Chicago, San Francisco and Boston.                                                                                  But in the New York group, according to Juenger’s report, participants – 16 men and women aged 23-38, the age groups most identified with severing ties to pay TV – found it extremely hard to craft the package of channels that they watch most at a reasonable price, one of the main selling points of over-the-top TV offerings.

I've thought about these words often as I've wandered through the city recently, its vibrancy now silenced by the coronavirus pandemic. Normally, the months leading into summer bring bustling crowds to the city's famous landmarks. This year, they sit empty and quiet. Some parts are ghost towns, scenes from a science fiction movie. With so few people about, and so many businesses closed, its starkness has called out to me in black and white.

Though I was right that Flynn was never masked in connection with the Kislyak call on December 29, 2016, I was off the mark in hypothesizing that the conversation may be been intercepted by an intelligence agency other than the FBI -- perhaps the CIA or a foreign intelligence service. Sadly, this owes to my giving the FBI the benefit of the doubt: Had Flynn been picked up on a FISA surveillance of which he was not the target (i.e., a surveillance of Kislyak), I reasoned that the FBI would have masked his identity under statutorily required “minimization instructions.” Indeed, we now know that Flynn’s identity was masked (and then unmasked) dozens of times before and after December 29, precisely because the government knew those minimization rules applied to him.

It was but one sign that environmental policies were to be among the first things cast aside or suspended as the COVID-19 pandemic descended on Canada.
 Fear of contamination from reused packaging and the need to operate with reduced staff and with fewer interactions between people, prompted retailers to bar reusable packaging, from bags to coffee cups. Restaurants were forced to go to a take-out only model, pushing the need for plastic and Styrofoam containers through the roof.

Mercy, Moses and Adisa’s dead baby girl have one thing in common. Their mothers were abandoned by their fathers. It is as if they did not exist beyond the procreation minute. It is not enough for us to blame young women driven to various degrees of insanity by poverty, helplessness and possible post-partum depression. We are familiar with the name-calling, mothers who abandon or even kill their children are described as evil, demonic, wicked, selfish, the list goes on. We are merciless in our judgement and condemnation. The negative epithets might be deserving, but who and where are the men who sleep with these mothers with reckless abandon and go on to abandon them? Are the fathers of these children itinerant, anonymous rapists? Are they local Lotharios who enticed the mothers with sweet talk and a pittance? Are they one-night stands? Are they deceitful married men who promised to marry them and then disappeared into thin air when they got the news of a baby on the way? When we find these mothers, who kill or abandon their children and subject them to whatever blame or punishment we think they deserve, we need to invest the same amount of energy in identifying the merciless fathers of these babies.

It did not take long for the TV industry to embrace Periscope.
 Actors, networks and shows have already signed up for the live-streaming video app that Twitter launched on Thursday. _Breaking Bad_ star Aaron Paul live- streamed a concert in his living room. _Tonight Show_ host Jimmy Fallon shared a feed of his monologue rehearsal.
 The San Francisco-based company, which was acquired in January for $100 million by Twitter but operates separately, is no doubt hoping that live- streaming mobile videos will find a place — and perhaps fill a void — among the posts and photos and pre-recorded and edited video clips of other popular social media apps.
 Users follow accounts on Periscope and receive notifications when one of them has gone live with a feed. Periscope, which is available now for iOS, with an Android version in the works, gives users the option of following the same accounts they follow on Twitter while also offering suggestions of the “most- loved” accounts. When a live stream is in action, followers can post comments for all viewers to see as well as convey their approval with an unlimited number of hearts. Streams can be limited to specific people or open to everyone; when over, they can be saved or erased.
 Here is a list of 15 TV accounts to follow on Periscope:

GREENVILLE, N.C. -- A car wash worker in North Carolina found treasure amid the business's trash when he discovered a $1,200 IRS stimulus check mixed in with the garbage.
   
 Antonio Hernandez was taking out the trash at the Greenville car wash when he spotted the payment in the can, WITN-TV quoted his daughter, Michelle Alvarado, as saying.
   
 Hernandez and Alvarado were able to track down recipient Charles Thompson, who said he was not even expecting to get a check after recently moving to a new address.
   
 "I was behind on rent, I work construction so I work by the day, and I just try to keep going and going as best I can," Thompson told the news station. "That money helped put me ahead and put me on the right track a little bit, to get back on my feet."
   
 Hernandez and Alvarado added that they were happy to help connect Thompson with the lost funds, even though they and Thompson had no idea how the check ended up at the car wash in the first place.
   
 "It was very important for him to receive that check, especially in these uncertain times," Alvarado said.
   
 The IRS has been sending the economic impact payments to millions of Americans around the country as part of a rescue package aimed at combating the economic effects of shutdowns amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Penny stocks are like lottery tickets: Most are worthless. Yes, there's a tiny chance you'll strike it rich, but leaving your retirement plan to chance is the same as not planning at all. Go the reliable route and start saving and investing now. If you build a diversified portfolio that you can hold for the long term, you'll see far more predictable results.

“I was scared I was going to let the older girls down and ruin things for everybody,” the 17-year-old Naughton said. “I got more comfortable with the older girls. They led by example every drill, and I followed what they did.
 “Eventually, I got used to the pitchers and how fast the ball came off the bat in this age group. I got better my eighth grade and freshman years, but last year was when I really stopped feeling those nerves.”
 That was especially true at the plate.
 “I stopped trying to hit the ball out (of the ballpark) every time I went up there,” she said. “I just started worrying about putting the bat on the ball and doing the best I could. That worked pretty well for me.”
 Naughton – who will be a senior at Cheyenne Central this fall – is now the player setting the example, Galicia said.
 “There are people on this team who work as hard as she does, but nobody outworks her,” he said. “She shows up to every practice we have, even the extra ones that are optional. She has put in the time, and it has really paid off for her.”
 Cheyenne’s roster lists Naughton as a third baseman, catcher and outfielder. She was part of a three-player rotation at catcher with Trista Stehwein and Maggie Seghetti. Seghetti isn’t playing this summer, and Extreme didn’t add any catchers. That means Naughton will see a lot more time behind the plate, which is where her extra efforts may have yielded the most dividends. She has gone from struggling to block errant pitches to being a solid backstop.
 “When we get to bracket play on Sundays, we can’t afford to give up extra runs,” Galicia said. “The catchers have to get dirty, block balls and make plays. (Naughton) was doing everything but that before. I have no doubt she can do that now.
 “She had to relax and get more confident. She got the extra reps and became a lot more confident in what she was doing.”

he paradigm of mind–brain dualism, like the story of syphilis, is by no means virgin territory. However, Allan Ropper and Brian Burrell’s _How The Brain Lost Its Mind: Sex, Hysteria, and the Riddle of Mental Illness_ puts both the legacy of dualism and the story of syphilis under the microscope, and offers a novel “redress [to the] derailing of a coordinated neurological and psychiatric approach to mental illness.” With the experience of a leading academic neurologist (Ropper) and an authority on brain collections (Burrell), the pair team up for their second book. They present a highly readable switched-at-birth story in which the discipline of neurology pursued an inscrutable malady termed “hysteria” and the emerging field of psychiatry gained purchase through claiming as its own the first known organically based cause of mental illness, neurosyphilis.

DARLINGTON, S.C. (AP) -- Denny Hamlin won NASCAR's first Wednesday race since 1984 when rain stopped the event with 20 laps remaining at Darlington Raceway.
   
 The Daytona 500 winner was out front but out of fresh tires and trying to hang on when he got unintended help from Joe Gibbs Racing teammate Kyle Busch. The reigning Cup champion caused Chase Elliott to crash eight laps earlier to bring out the caution.
   
 A furious Elliott waited for Busch on the apron of the track and flipped Busch the middle finger as he passed. As NASCAR cleaned the track, it started to rain and the cars were called to pit road under red-flag.
   
 It was an already active evening at "The Track Too Tough To Tame" as drivers were racing against the field and the weather. As the drivers sat in their cars waiting for NASCAR to pull the plug, a handful of Elliott's crew members sat on the pit wall staring down Busch.
   
 One of Busch's crew members sat between them on the wall and NASCAR eventually ordered everyone back over the wall. Eight minutes later, the race was called and Busch was greeted by Alan Gustafson, Elliott's crew chief and Busch's former crew chief when he drove for Hendrick Motorsports, for a conversation between two masked competitors.
   
 Busch immediately copped to the error.
   
 "There's no question I made a mistake and just misjudged the gap," Busch said. "They're upset, they're mad. I'm not just going to fix and we're going to go have ice cream tomorrow. They're going to dwell on it and I'm sure there are repercussions of it I'm going to have down the road."
   
 Meanwhile, a fox was scampering across the deserted track and Hamlin, wearing a mask that depicted his actual smile, was having a muted celebration in the rain.
   
 He walked to victory lane under a large black umbrella. It was a 1-2 finish for Joe Gibbs Racing and Toyota. Hamlin has won three times at Darlington and has two wins this season.
   
 "I got my happy face on. Made sure I brought it with me," Hamlin said of his mask. He said he also had masks made with a "sad face" but only brought the smiling masks to a track he counts among his favorite.
   
 Hamlin thought he was in good shape when he made his last pit stop but a caution by Clint Bowyer, who won the first two stages of the race, jumbled the strategy with 34 laps remaining.
   
 Hamlin had no choice but to stay out on the track, and his crew chief Chris Gabehart told him over the radio, "you ain't going to like it, but we're going to have to eat our vegetables here."
   
 Hamlin, the leader because he didn't pit on the restart with 29 to go, only had to hold off traffic for one lap before the Busch and Elliott collision. The rain then came and Hamlin earned the trophy.
   
 "It's a driver's race track," he said. "You can do different things to make (the car) handle. We got it right."
   
 The race marked the first time in NASCAR history that the Cup Series had two points-paying races at the same track in one week.
   
 The start of NASCAR's second race back during the coronavirus pandemic was moved up an hour because of poor weather, but that was then delayed nearly 90 minutes because it rained most of the day.
   
 When the action finally began, the 310-mile affair was spirited from start to finish because drivers were unsure if they were racing to the halfway point -- the mark a race becomes official -- or the distance.
   
 NASCAR returned to action Sunday at Darlington after a 10 weeks off by using a a strict health protocol and limiting those in attendance to only the most essential for conducting a race.
   
 Health screenings were required to enter the track and each of the 40 cars were allowed just 16 team members.
   
 Fox Sports again broadcast the race primarily from a studio in Charlotte, North Carolina, with just one pit reporter at Darlington. For its prerace show, drivers used varying technology to make brief appearances while sitting alone in their motorhomes.
   
 Drivers had to travel to the track alone, pass through a health screening and then isolate before the race. They are required to wear face masks.
   
 NASCAR has an ambitious return plan of 20 races spanning its three national series between Sunday's return and June 21. Spectators are not expected to be permitted to any of the events in this span.
   
 Rain disrupted the schedule Tuesday night when the Xfinity Series was washed out. That race is now scheduled to be held Thursday afternoon.

Everyone looks forward to tomatoes. We can't wait for the peaches and corn. Some of us even get excited about zucchini. But who gets pumped for kohlrabi? Anyone?      It doesn't help that a kohlrabi plant looks like a snake that recently swallowed a beach ball. The edible part is the swollen section of stem, which tastes like the part of broccoli most people throw away.      Kohlrabi is perhaps most popular with farmers who are looking for some early season variety in their market displays, CSA boxes or farm stands. Thus, kohlrabi finds its way into the fridge and lurks there, for weeks or longer, never spoiling, never letting you off the hook.      If you take the time to peel one you will be rewarded with a crisp, watery bite and a faint hint of spice, like a cross between jicama and a mild radish.      Sliced thickly on a veggie platter next to some dip, kohlrabi may never get a second chance. Sliced thinly or shredded, kohlrabi clings to sauce the way angel hair pasta does, which opens up many possibilities.      My favorite way to use shredded kohlrabi is in som tum, a green papaya salad that is one of the world's favorite Thai dishes. Green papaya are scarce in my parts, and kohlrabi so available I use it instead, along with shredded carrots. Salty, sweet, spicy, acidic, with a bitter garlic pungency and full of umami, this salad has something for every taste bud.      When I was in Bangkok I spent some time seeking out the best som tum I could find, a mission that took me to a certain outdoor market on the edge of the city. I found my way to the section where stall after stall serves nothing but som tum. I bowed to a man with a bandana on his head.      The "som" in som tum refers to its sour taste, while the "tum" mimics the sound of the pounding of a pestle into a mortar. I'm not sure what I told this gentleman, or what he heard me say, but he nodded and smiled. Then he put a handful of small, living crabs into a tall wooden bowl, and started pounding. His heavy wooden pestle went "tum tum tum" on those crabs until they were a paste, to which he added spices and pounded some more. Then he ladled in some fish sauce, generously -- the way you would want someone to add hot fudge to your ice cream.      The som tum maker swapped his pestle for a pair of wooden forks and added shredded green papaya, herbs and, for good measure, more fish sauce. He stirred it all together, scooped the salad into a paper bowl, and handed it to me.      It was a bit fishy, and hot enough to burn a hole in the sun, but the rich array of flavors was dazzling. The beauty of this dish is that it balances flavors so intense, each one would be too overpowering on its own. But together they neutralize each other, like a mutually assured destruction.      I respected that som tum, but between the fish sauce, high heat and mashed up crabs I was in over my head. I didn't take too many bites, but in looking into that abyss I learned something, and returned to my quarters thrilled with my discovery.      Kohlrabi som tum can be an adventure, too, if less cathartic. I call it kohl som, which translates to something like "Thai-style sour kohlrabi."      Kohl Som   • 1 baseball-sized kohlrabi, peeled and grated or shredded (about 3 cups)   • 1 large handful cherry tomatoes, sliced into halves or quarters   • 1 medium carrot, grated (about 1 cup)   • 1 medium-sized clove garlic, pressed or grated   • ½ teaspoon salt   • 1 or more tablespoons fish sauce   • Juice of 1 lime (or 3 tablespoons lime juice)   • Chile flakes, to taste   • Up to 1 tablespoon brown sugar   • 2 green onions, chopped   • ½ cup chopped cilantro (or parsley)   • Optional garnish: 2 tablespoons peanuts, dry roasted in a pan   • Sliced jalapenos, optional      Combine the kohlrabi, carrot, tomatoes, garlic and salt in a mixing bowl. Give the tomatoes a squeeze to crush them a little. Set aside.      Combine the fish sauce, lime juice, sugar and chile flakes, and stir until the brown sugar is fully dissolved. Add this sauce and the green onions, cilantro and jalapenos, if using, to the mixing bowl. Toss the salad in the dressing, a little roughly to crush the tomatoes a bit more, and garnish with the peanuts.

The baby girl is so beautiful. With her eyes closed and a blanket keeping her warm, she looks like an angel. I was asked to give her a name. I named her _Anuoluwa_ – God’s Mercy. Mercy. That is what she has received. Anyone staring at this lovely bundle of joy would never have imagined what she looked like the week before. She had been found not more than a few hours old, with her umbilical cord still attached. She was covered in blood and dirt. She had been left as naked as she had been born, with nothing to cover her. Mercy. That is the only thing that stood between her being eaten by stray dogs or rodents who would have been attracted by the smell of blood.

In the second photo, Pamela showed off her profile view, leaning back against the shelf and turning her head to shoot a sultry look towards the camera. She held one hand up to rest against her head and the other perched on the shelf behind her. The angle gave viewers an eyeful of her busty chest and curvy backside.

SUNY Cobleskill announced Wednesday, May 22, that esports will be offered as a varsity sport beginning with the 2020-21 academic year.                                                                                          While some may ask how esports fits into the same department as the institution’s 20 other varsity sports, made up of more traditional sports like soccer and basketball, Fighting Tigers Athletic Director Marie Curran-Headley said that seeing the school’s esports athletes compete convinced her they are more similar to athletes in traditional sports than they are different.                                                                                          “When I watched the students play, and I could sit and listen to the camaraderie and sportsmanship, then the leadership kicks in, the competitiveness, the strategy, they are exactly like every athlete I’ve ever met,” Curran-Headley told The Daily Star. “It’s a game on a computer rather than a ball on a foot or in a hand, but they are really like our other athletes in every other way.”
