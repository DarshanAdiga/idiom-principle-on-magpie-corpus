Here is the question at hand for sensible Floridians: Why should the governor sign a placeholder budget, a relic of the pre-coronavirus era of just three weeks ago, rather than call legislator back to Tallahassee to adress it in real time?
   
 The coronavirus, which has nearly shut down our tourism-dependent economy, will cost the state billions in sales tax revenue. Gov, Ron DeSantis, rather than sign the budget bill (HB 5001), should quickly call state lawmakers back to Tallahassee for a special session to overhaul the unrealistic budget they passed on March 19.
   
 Granted, state lawmakers did scale back a major tax cut package. They also included $52.5 million in additional money, most of it from the federal government, for COVID-19 response in the current budget year. Another $300 million in contingency funds can be used by DeSantis for emergency response on top of a $3 billion fund intended for emergencies.
   
 Florida Senate President Bill Galvano, R-Bradenton, said, "we'll see what the future holds."
   
 Some two weeks or so of economic upheaval wrought by COVID-19 has shown a budget rewrite has been all but guaranteed since early March.
   
 Indeed, state Sen. Tom Lee, R-Thonotosassa, told his colleagues that the current situation "feels worse" than after the 9/11 attacks, when lawmakers had to come back and revise the budget.
   
 "I have constituents at home that are going to wonder what we were thinking," Lee said. "We do the best we can with the information we have at the time."
   
 That is not what happened.
   
 A day after the budget vote was taken, state Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis asked lawmakers to begin meeting with state economists with regard to revised revenue projections used to frame the budget.
   
 Why? Because while it wasn't yet clear just how bad the economic damage will be, the Florida Restaurant and Lodging Association was already saying that hotels and businesses had shed 400,000 jobs since the coronavirus outbreak. Still, lawmakers reassured each other on March 19 that the $4 billion in the unemployment compensation fund would be enough to weather the storm.
   
 DeSantis said last week that he isn't in a rush to review the budget or 196 other bills as he focuses on the fight against COVID-19. He also told reporters the state might not have to dip deep into its reserves with President Donald Trump declaring earlier in the day that a major disaster exists in Florida.
   
 "I'm just going to let the budget sit for now. I'm not going to start vetoing everything, and I'm not going to sign it yet," DeSantis said. "Let's see where we are, and let's kind of see how the situation unfolds."
   
 Patronis, meanwhile, doubled down last week on his call for the governor to revisit the budget in an interview with Florida Panhandle TV station WMBB. "I was here when the collapse happened last time and I don't want to dig us out of that mess again. Been there, done that, learned from it. And I know as much money as we can hold onto, that much quicker we recover from this challenge."
   
 The Legislature should meet again soon in special session and make changes before July 1, when the budget takes effect.

Yes. Another title we’re now starting is a big project, “Hagen von Tronje,” which is basically the Nibelung saga, the biggest saga on earth – with a twist. We will produce the biggest feature film that has been made in Germany so far, and along with that feature film, a six-part series coming out. These kind of productions in the past were impossible, because of their huge budgets – now, not anymore. “Hagen” will compete with international movies and shows. We've just announced the directors, Cyrill Boss and Philipp Stennert, who did “Pagan Peak,” and will direct both the series and the feature. So again, we’re once more trying to push the envelope.

Job searches related to remote working have witnessed a jump of over 261 per cent amid the coronavirus lockdown, a report said. Job seekers are increasingly searching for terms like 'remote', 'work from home' and related phrases, with searches for remote work witnessing an increase of over 261 per cent since February, according to data from job site Indeed. The overall job searches have increased by 278 per cent on Indeed India since September 2019, it added. "Flexibility has always been a vital aspect of job opportunities to job seekers, especially millennial, who today make up over half of India's working population. "In challenging times like these, being able to continue working remotely serves as an asset, not only to the job seeker's skill set but also in helping the organization maintain business," Pawel Adrjan, Economist at Indeed said. A previous study by Indeed India showed that 83 per cent of job seekers consider remote work policy an important factor when searching for a job, so much so that 53 per cent of employees would consider taking a pay cut in order to have access to remote working options. About 56 per cent of employees and 83 per cent of employers concur that offering flexibility in working can help boost productivity, it added.

 Brittney Bradham said she is set on her rent for this month, but she worries that next month might be a different story.
   
 The single mother of two young children, who lost her job when Crazy D's Pub closed because of the coronavirus pandemic, has made her April rent payment.
   
 "It's definitely a struggle,'' Bradham said. "I was lucky I saved up $1,000."
   
 But with little income, that can go fast, she said.
   
 "I do get death benefits, but that's not going to help much," she said. "I'm trying to find a job. I don't know if my landlord is really going to help out or extend anything."
   
 She is not the only renter with concerns.
   
 Thousands of workers in the hospitality industry and other small businesses have lost their jobs in the past couple of weeks as the coronavirus threat has ramped up.
   
 Some workers who were laid off qualify for unemployment benefits, but that usually pays only a portion of the wages they were earning.
   
 With the first of the month being the traditional time that rent is due, companies that rent homes in Fayetteville have heard from some tenants who are struggling -- and they are expecting to hear from more. And some property management companies are working with tenants who are now unemployed or working fewer hours.
   
 The list of people who have lost income grew last week when Cape Fear Valley Health announced it was furloughing about 300 employees as some medical procedures were postponed and some clinics reduced hours.
   
 Tom Wills is the owner of Aaims Property Management Inc., which rents more than 1,000 mostly single-family homes in Cumberland, Hoke and Harnett counties. He said one furloughed Cape Fear Valley employee contacted the office Tuesday morning to ask whether the landlord was willing to work with the tenant on paying this month's rent.
   
 He said some homeowners have no choice but to insist that the renter pay the full amount because they have mortgage payments that depend on rent proceeds.
   
 "Certainly (nonpayment) could put the homeowner in a bind, and I would suspect that many owners will say, 'No, I'm sorry, but I've got a mortgage payment to make and I break even every month, if that, so I need you to pay the rent, and I need you to pay the full amount of the rent,'" Wills said.
   
 Wills said the company is leaving decisions about leeway up to the homeowner.
   
 "I know some of our owners, we've already notified about this and some said they can try to help," he said. "I think we're sort of lucky in our area that with such a large military (population), the checks keep coming in."
   
 Wills said his company rents houses with a wide range of prices, from $600 a month to $1,800 a month.
   
 "I would suspect that the lower-priced properties are probably going to be hit harder," he said. "Those are the folks with the jobs that are probably laying them off."
   
 Townsend Rental Homes is offering a rent payment plan to some of those who have lost their jobs, according to the company's website.
   
 "We encourage all those who have become unemployed due to COVID-19 to let us know as soon as possible if you believe you may be unable to pay your rent," the site says, adding that people who have lost jobs or had hours reduced are encouraged to apply for unemployment benefits.
   
 "When you have submitted your application - let us know," the website says. "The sooner we are aware of your current situation, the better we can communicate to the owner. Remember, this affects them as well. Late fees may still accrue if no action is taken on your part. We understand how important maintaining good credit is, so we want to work with you."
   
 Payment plans will be available, Townsend says, including making payments every two weeks to help tenants manage expenses.
   
 Kenan Chance is the broker in charge at Strother Property Management, which rents apartments in buildings such as Oakridge in Haymount as well as homes on behalf of owners. She said property owners have so far been willing to work with renters who lost their jobs.
   
 "A lot of the owners are being very understanding," she said.
   
 Chance said she encourages renters to let the company know their situation as soon as possible.
   
 People who can't pay their rent would be impacted by Gov. Roy Cooper's order that goes along with a recent order by North Carolina Supreme Court Chief Justice Cheri Beasley, which says that no new eviction proceedings go forward under the order until it expires April 17 unless extended by the chief justice.
   
 The governor's order urges the delay of any eviction proceedings that had already begun.
   
 It normally takes a month and half to evict someone who doesn't pay rent and in this climate it could take longer, said Beth Faleris, an Onslow County lawyer who specializes in eviction cases and has handled cases in Fayetteville.
   
 She small claims courts are closed until at least April 17.
   
 And after a hearing is held, the renter would have the right to appeal a decision by a magistrate, which could buy the tenant another month in the property. That could be good for the tenant but bad for landlords who need the rent payment to make a mortgage payment, Faleris said.

COVID-19 disruption has brought out TV news and digital as champions as the country deals with the 21-day lockdown. TV news showcased a 57% growth in viewership at all India level. The growth showcased across all major languages.As India grapples with a new way of life -- with social distancing and work-from0home becoming a norm -- it is impossible to not see the impact of all of this on media consumption. Over the last few weeks, social distancing, and staying at home has had a significant effect on media consumption across the country.Demand for content on both TV and digital spiked during COVID-19 disruption period and advertisers remain upbeat about the two mediums.According to BARC-Nielsen data, total TV consumption grew by 8 percent across India during COVID-19 disruption period.This data further revealed that Indians are spending more time on TV to watch news, GECs (general entertainment channels) and movies. These three genres have contributed the most in the spike in viewership on TV during COVID-19 week, which is the week starting March 14.In terms of viewership, TV news saw 57 percent growth in viewership across India and the growth was witnessed across all major languages.The daily average reach of the news genre on TV grew by 34 percent, highest amid all categories.&quot;Television is the screen of the households and under these circumstances, household is glued to TV,&quot; says Sunil Lulla, CEO, BARC India. &quot;The audience, they don't have anywhere else to go. What do you have surprisingly is even kids are watching news. So there is big growth in news. The consumers trust the news which is on TV. They know it is credible. Hence, they are watching it continuously,&quot; he adds.In fact, Network18 channels recorded a 50 percent growth in average daily reach during week 1 of the COVID-19 outbreak. During the same period, Network18 reached out to more than 10 crore TV viewers on a daily basis.One growth factor is that news is the only medium which is producing new content.But on the other side when it comes to General Entertainment channels or GECs there is no fresh content. The production of new episodes has stopped leaving GECs with no choice but to play repeats of their old shows.Mediums such as Radio and OHH have also taken a hit due to lack of adequate drive time on the roads, print is facing a massive distribution problem and cinemas are shut. In this scenario, digital has emerged as a shining star.As a part of Comscore's ongoing investigation into the COVID-19 and its impact on the media and advertising industry around the world, they recently released a study focusing on key areas of digital consumption.As per the insights from this study, in India, compared with the week of Feb. 10-16, 2020 visits to websites and mobile apps in the 'General News' category increased by 61% in the week of March 16-22, 2020. However, most of the increase occurred recently: compared with the week of March 9-15, 2020, visits went up by 50% during the week of March 16-22, 2020.Also, the study states how as financial markets fluctuated with the spread of the pandemic, the reach of, and engagement with, digital content within the 'Business News' category have surged. The number of unique visitors increased by 22% between the weeks of March 9-15, 2020 and March 16-22, 2020, while the increase in total visits was 34%, and total minutes increased by 27%.Vikram Sakhuja, CEO, Madison World, feels that from an environment standpoint, it is a good time for advertisers to use digital.&quot;The number of people who are there on the online space have increased. Today, a large percentage of digital advertising that is bought is bought on biddable platforms. So if there is going to be more audience out there, you can actually lower your big price and you can target better, you can geographically go to various places plus you can get the audience for a lower cost per thousand than you are used to.&quot;But many experts feel that since big spenders such as FMCG are dealing with distribution crisis owing to countrywide lockdown, there is not much to advertise. But would it be the right time to build brands on platforms that are watched and followed so extensively?&quot;If you have some good messages, it is a great time to advertise because people are receptive,&quot; says Sakhuja. He is also of the opinion that it's also a great time for a brand to build trust.Now, Over the Top or OTT platforms have also seen a spike in the viewership. But way forward is it going to be a smooth ride for video streaming platforms as producers are delaying the release of their new films and their originals are also lagging as the content production industry has canceled all the shoots?Ashish Pherwani, Partner and Media &amp;amp; Entertainment Leader, EY India feels it is time for OTT players and producers to rethink.&quot;We are seeing that there are so many movies that got produced last year which never got a release. And we see a lot of value in that library now,&quot; Pherwani says.He adds that this trend has in fact started last year but there might be a chance of many digital-first releases by producers this year. &quot;But, many big producers will still be waiting for a big theatrical release first.&quot;But even as overall viewership and audience has spiked, the industry faces uncertainty from a fall in advertising revenues.All the major media planning agencies are revising their ad spend forecast which was predicted between 10% to 11% for 2020 to single digits and are unsure of when the situation will crawl back to normal.&quot;Everyone is fighting a battle of survival. The first focus is on safety and getting through this period in a proper way. You are going to be geared up for comeback but it will comeback only very slowly,&quot; says Ashish Bhasin, CEO APAC and Chairman India, Dentsu Aegis Network.

Singh said it was a conscious decision to leapfrog to BS-VI as first upgrading to BS-V and then shifting to BS-VI would have prolonged the journey to 4 to 6 years. Besides, oil refineries, as well as automobile manufacturers, would have had to make investments twice - first to producing BS-V grade fuel and engines and then BS-VI ones. State-owned oil refineries spent about Rs 35,000 crore to upgrade plants that could produce ultra-low sulphur fuel. This investment is on top of Rs 60,000 crore they spent on refinery upgrades in the previous switchovers.

This past weekend, my husband and I made a delivery of personal care packages for the clients of Lake Cares Food Pantry in Mount Dora on behalf of my organization Kitch'n Lyfe Skills. Our mission is to reduce the instances of food insecurity through education, enlightenment, and empowerment.
   
 One of the ways we carry out our mission is through our Hello Beautiful Girl Period Project. During the school year, we supply Lake and Sumter County schools with Blossom Kits designed to help girls who experience their period during school hours. In light of schools not being held in traditional fashion, the organization had to refocus.
   
 We are now taking health care packs to local food pantries and organizations to help us distribute these much-needed items. You might ask how this correlates to food insecurity? Any obstacle that prevents or reduces the amount of money spent on food is a contributor to food insecurity, so we seek to provide relief and increase resources for food purchases.
   
 After we dropped off the bags, we decided to call a few of our favorite restaurants in town and get takeout in bulk to help reduce our trips out. Our first stop was to my dear friend Cody at Cody's on 4th. She was open and it was a delight to see folks practicing social distancing and picking up their food. We also got a sweet treat with our food too. We ordered breakfast and my husband was thrilled to get his salmon bagel and fresh fruit.
   
 We also ordered from Copacabana Cuban Cafe and picked up chicken fricassee and, of course, a Cuban sandwich. It was so weird not seeing all the usual faces out front but it was apparent they were in the kitchen because our food was just as delicious as if we were eating in. While my husband went inside, I parked across the way and noticed a tent in the usually full parking lot and the sign said, "Crave Bakehouse".
   
 Well, you had me at "Crave". Of course, I practiced social distancing and a very nice woman by the name of Barbara came up to the car and - since I wasn't familiar with one of Mount Dora Marketplace's newest businesses - she began to explain this Paleo, gluten-free and keto-friendly donut to me. My initial thought was how could something that addresses so many diets actually be tasty?
   
 Well halfway home I found out that they were delicious. Crave Bakehouse offerings are sweet and savory. Although I didn't try any savory, the cinnamon sugar and limeade were delish. Right now they are offering curbside service a few days a week and you can visit their page on Facebook at Crave Bakehouse or call for this week's offerings.

“We’re just gonna do some cleaning and day-to-day things until we can open back up,” Barney said. “All I can say is support local businesses. There’s still businesses we can support in the community and we can help keep them open and it will come back around.”
 Tami Scott, owner of Creation Station Crafts and Graphics, said business for her has come to a “screeching halt.”
 “It’s scary but I support the governor’s order 100%,” Scott, a former medic, said. “I’ve seen how infection impacts the body. If my business closes, it closes. I hope it stays open but I think people are being extremely complacent.”
 Scott says she’s never anything like COVID-19 in her life. According to Scott, with the average flu, a couch can infect nine people, while a cough with COVID-19 can infect 45 people.
 “I think this isn’t the worst we’ll see,” she said.
 Scott says people looking to place orders can call, email, text or even Facebook message her with order, just don’t come to the door. Orders will be filled and placed outside Creation Station when completed.
 During her closure, Scott will be providing Facebook live videos where kids can follow along and create their own crafts while giving parents a needed break.
 Creation Station can take orders through Facebook messenger, email at creationstation31@yahoo.com or by phone call or text at 208-541-2330.
 Rachel Anderson of Country Cottons Embroidery and Screen Printing also reports a hit in business. With their doors closed to the public, Country Cottons will still take orders over the phone and through email.
 “We’re filling orders as they come in and taking payments over the phone,” Anderson said. “Once it’s ready, we’ll take the orders out to customers’ cars like curbside service.”
 According to Anderson, there’s only four employees that are able to continue distancing within the store space.
 “When we get to a point where we don’t have orders, I’ll still be offering work for my employees,” she said. “I have no intentional of laying anyone off.”
 Anderson says that anything people can do to support them and other local businesses is greatly appreciated and will be “tremendously” helpful for the community.

India on Wednesday joined a select league of nations having the world's cleanest petrol and diesel as oil companies rolled out Euro-VI emission compliant fuels without either disruption or a price increase.
 Leapfrogging from BS 4 grade fuel straight to BS 6 grade, equivalent to Euro 6 fuel, petrol and diesel would have resulted in an up to Re 1 per litre increase in cost but oil companies decided against passing this on to consumers and instead adjusted it against the reduction warranted from international oil prices plummeting to a 17-year low.
 "We are today 100 per cent supplying BS 6 petrol and diesel. All the over 68,700 petrol pumps in the country are selling the cleaner fuel from today," said Sanjiv Singh, Chairman, Indian Oil Corp (IOC) - the firm that controls roughly half of the market. He said there is no change in the retail selling price of the fuels because of the switchover.
 Oil companies have not changed petrol and diesel price for over a fortnight now as they first adjusted the reduction warranted against the ₹3 per litre increase in excise duty and now are setting off the increased cost of BS 6 fuel. Petrol and diesel rates were last revised on March 16. A litre of petrol in Delhi comes for ₹69.59 and diesel is priced at ₹62.29.
 (Also read: India drives into BS 6 era with air pollution control in mind)
 Singh said the switch over from BS 4 to BS 6 was achieved in just three years, a feat not seen in any of the large economies around the globe. India will join the select league of nations using petrol and diesel containing just 10 parts per million of sulphur as it looks to cut vehicular emissions that are said to be one of the reasons for the choking pollution in major cities.
 India adopted Euro-III equivalent (or Bharat Stage-III) fuel with a sulphur content of 350 ppm in 2010 and then took seven years to move to BS 4 that had a sulphur content of 50 ppm. From BS 4 to BS 6 it took just three years.
 "We have as oil industry stuck to the timelines given by the government for a switchover to BS 6 fuel from April 1," Singh told PTI. "In fact, we had been supplying BS 6 fuel for almost three weeks now."
 Besides IOC, Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL), as well as Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) too, started supplying BS 6 grade fuel much before the April 1 deadline. While a BPCL official said the company started supplying BS 6 grade fuel from all its 16,000 petrol pumps, HPCL Chairman and Managing Director M K Surana said the company's refineries started production of the new grade of fuel in January and progressively all the 16,400 pumps have taken to supplying the new fuel.
 Singh said it was a conscious decision to leapfrog to BS 6 as first upgrading to BS 5 and then shifting to BS 6 would have prolonged the journey to 4 to 6 years. Besides, oil refineries, as well as automobile manufacturers, would have had to make investments twice - first to producing BS 5 grade fuel and engines and then BS 6 ones.
 State-owned oil refineries spent about ₹35,000 crore to upgrade plants that could produce ultra-low sulphur fuel. This investment is on top of ₹60,000 crore they spent on refinery upgrades in the previous switchovers.
 India adopted a fuel up-gradation programme in the early 1990s. Low lead gasoline (petrol) was introduced in 1994 in Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, and Chennai. On February 1, 2000, unleaded gasoline was mandated nationwide. Similarly, BS-2000 (Euro-I equivalent, BS-1) vehicle emission norms were introduced for new vehicles from April 2000. BS-II (Euro-II equivalent) emission norms for new cars were introduced in Delhi from 2000 and extended to the other metro cities in 2001. Benzene limits have been reduced progressively from 5 per cent in 2000 to 1 per cent nationwide.
 Lead content in gasoline was removed in phases and only unleaded gasoline is being produced and sold from February 1, 2000. The octane number of gasoline signifies the improved performance of the engine. Loss in octane number due to phasing out of lead was made up by installing new facilities in the refinery and changes in refinery operation. RON (Research Octane Number) of gasoline for BS-2000 spec was increased to 88. This has over time been increased to 91.
 Singh said sulphur reduction will reduce Particulate Matter (PM) emissions even in the in-use older generation diesel vehicles.

“It was disappointing,” Demarest said. “Of course, you understand the health concerns and they made right decision, but as a competitor you want to get out there and test yourself against the best.”
 Unlike other events where there is one qualifying race to make the U.S. Olympic team, the triathlon is set up a little bit different. There are a series of triathlons where competitors earn points based on their results. The top two finishers over the course of four months will earn a spot on the U.S. team.
 “I still don’t completely understand the points system because it’s kind of a tiered system,” Demarest said. “The higher the event, the more points you can earn.”
 The Olympic triathlon is also double the length of what Demarest was used to when he was on the junior circuit. The Olympics has a 1,500-meter swim, a 40K bike ride and a 10K run.
 Demarest has increased his training regimen as a result. He runs between 50 to 60 miles a week with a long run of 14 miles. He’ll bike about 20 miles day, with a long ride of 60 miles during the week. He swims about 5,000 meters a day. He was scheduled to join his Origin Performance teammates in Colorado but had to cancel his travel plans because of the virus.
 “I usually double up on events each day and do all three on some days,” Demarest said. “With the coronavirus, it’s been easier to bike because there are fewer cars on the road. Finding a place to swim has been a challenge. Most of the pools are closed, so I’ve done some of my workouts in the creeks around our house.”

As Covid-19 brings the world to a halt, some world leaders have spotted an opportunity to tighten their grip on power.
 In Hungary, a bill passed on Monday which handed Prime Minister Viktor Orban the power to rule by decree -- indefinitely.
 It gives him the authority to punish journalists if the government believes the reporting its not accurate and allows the government to hit citizens with heavy penalties for violating lockdown rules. It also prevents any elections or referendums from taking place while the measures are in effect.
 The move led to calls for the European Union to act, with Italy's former Prime Minister, Matteo Renzi, going to far as to suggest the bloc kick Hungary out if the measures were not revoked -- something that's far easier said than done.
 Orban's move is perhaps the most flagrant power grab to take place during this pandemic. However, other strongman leaders have spotted the opportunity to seize greater authority.
 In the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte -- a man who arrests his critics and has boasted about personally killing suspected criminals during his time as mayor of Davao City -- has secured emergency powers, giving him greater control of public services.
 Earlier this month, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faced criticism after his government approved the electronic tracking of patients, using technology that had previously only been used in the fight against terrorism.
 Netanyahu, of course, isn't the only leader using technology to track its citizens during the crisis. In Russia, authorities are using facial recognition technology to crack down on people violating quarantine and self- isolation.
 And from South Korea to Western Europe, democratically-elected governments are using digital tools to track the whereabouts of patients with coronavirus and monitor how effectively citizens are obeying social distancing measures.
 While such moves naturally spark immediate fears of political overreach from leaders, they also raise questions around what happens when this pandemic is over.
 The concern is that as the world comes to terms with its way of life, citizens become numb to what were initially extreme and extraordinary measures.
 "During crises, the window of what governments can get away with without pushback from the public tends to expand," says Brian Klaas, assistant professor of global politics at University College London.
 In nations with strong democratic traditions, governments can be better held to account by institutional checks and balances on governments -- ensuring that these powers truly are extraordinary and subject to review. That's a little harder in countries where democratic principles have been undermined, such as Hungary.
 "The problem with weak systems like Hungary is that Orban has eroded democracy for a long time and he's going to want to make this the new normal ... And he might get cheered on as he does because in crises, people look for leadership," says Klaas.
 It's not just Orban. Parag Khanna, author of The Future is Asian, explains that the "new authoritarians that take advantage of democratic majoritarianism, such as Duterte in Asia, and Orban in Europe," have in recent years "accorded themselves the right to rule by decree."
 While recent actions of these "new authoritarians" might seem extreme, they are largely legal and, in many cases, proportionate to the challenge of this coronavirus. Which puts the leaders of stronger democracies in a difficult position.
 "Democratic leaders have to avoid any statement criticizing the actions of other leaders that might downplay the significance of the pandemic," says Nic Cheeseman, professor of democracy at the University of Birmingham. "But their silence now risks handing authoritarians a blank check to cash at a future date."
 Worse, during a pandemic, strongman leaders can impose extraordinary measures in lockstep with nations like the United Kingdom and Italy, making them appear altogether more ordinary.
 "The worrying thing during a crisis is that leaders with authoritarian instincts can claim to only be doing what some established democracies are doing," says Cheeseman. But while robust democracies are expected to eventually roll back such measures, citizens in weak democracies might get saddled with them at the behest of the leader.
 Of course, this "new normal" problem doesn't apply only to nations with weakened democratic institutions.
 Historically, even the US has this century seen the executive hand itself extraordinary power during a crisis, the most obvious example of this being the Patriot Act, following the September 11 attacks in 2001.
 "If a 'rally round the flag' mentality kicks in around the world, leaders could find ways to exploit it," says Klaas. "If you accept 9/11 made people happy to give up certain liberties, consider this: The Imperial study says there will be 2.2 million deaths in the US if there's no extreme and sustained government intervention. That's the equivalent of 9/11 happening nearly every day for over two years."
 The example set by the US and its democratic allies really does matter. How countries like America, the UK, Germany and France emerge from this crisis will set the new bar for democratic norms.
 "During crises, centralized government power is generally ratcheted up," explains Cheeseman. "However, when the crisis is over, that power is not always handed back to the public and lower levels of levels of government."
 These go far beyond new legal instruments a leader might wield. As we have seen in Israel and Russia, new technologies can be used that curb people's civil liberties.
 Israel's electronic tracking of coronavirus patients allows the Israeli Security Agency, or Shin Bet to keep, tabs on citizens by using national ID numbers and phone numbers. Netanyahu defended approving the legislation to allow this without parliamentary oversight, claiming that "the virus is spreading at a tremendous pace, a delay of even one hour in these tools can lead to the deaths of many Israelis." The Knesset did later approve the use of the tracking technology, mandating it receive regular reports on how the information gathered had been used.
 Moscow's police claimed earlier this month that Russia's facial recognition system had led to 200 people flouting lockdown rules being caught and fined, a hardline message that in a time of crisis could play well with the public.
 "We want there to be even more cameras so that that there is no dark corner or side street left," said Oleg Baranov, Moscow's police chief, before saying that he wanted to add 9,000 cameras to the existing network of 170,000.
 And as nations ramp up efforts to handle the impact of the coronavirus outbreak, large, government-funded bureaucracies will be set up, handling everything from distributing medicines and benefits to nationalizing infrastructure.
 Laws on criminal detention might also be tweaked to impose lockdown measures in countries. Even in countries like the UK and France, police have been given extraordinary powers to implement social distancing rules.
 The fear is that those technologies, laws and institutions will outlive any government of the day and be exploited for political gain in the years that follow this crisis.
 "Even break clauses wouldn't necessarily help when it comes to new technologies because they don't cover infrastructure and technology changes that come into place during a crisis," says Cheeseman. "Cameras that tracked terrorists were then used to track extinction rebellion protestors; legislation that allows governments to detain suspects for longer in a crisis often stays on the books."
 And leaders that emerge from the pandemic on the front foot might, as Khanna puts it, not "let a crisis go to waste."
 At some point, this crisis will end and citizens around the world will be free to leave their homes. However, it's becoming abundantly clear that the world they walk into will be dramatically different from the one they left behind their front doors. And if the global population hasn't twigged this yet, their leaders already have.
 "Taking advantage of a crisis has little to do with managing it well," says Khanna. "Strongmen leaders or elected authoritarians should never be confused with public-spirited technocrats ... they are very much wolves in sheep's clothing."
 Global crises have a habit of creating distractions that leaders can exploit for their own power hunger. Right now, the world has plenty of power-hungry leaders. Couple that with a crisis the likes of which most of us have never seen, and it's not hard to see how this coronavirus global outbreak could be bad news for democracy, and those who depend on it.

SPRINGFIELD - Public K-12 schools statewide were instructed to begin remote learning days Tuesday until in-person instruction can resume, and standardized testing in the state is canceled for the year as well.
 Illinois Superintendent of Education Dr. Carmen Ayala was given the authority to define and give guidance on remote learning days in a recent executive order signed by Gov. JB Pritzker in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 All schools public and private will be closed through at least April 30 after Pritzker announced Tuesday he would extend an executive order that had previously closed them through April 7. The Illinois State Board of Education's remote learning guidance applies to public schools but the state's nonpublic schools are encouraged to use it to inform similar programs, according to an ISBE guidance document.
 "Remote learning will look different for every district and maybe even for every school. School districts will create plans based upon their local resources and their needs," Pritzker said at a COVID-19 news conference Tuesday in Chicago.
 Ayala wrote in a letter posted to ISBE's website that remote learning recommendations "strongly encourage" local districts to adopt grading models of "pass or incomplete" that "embrace the principle of 'no educational harm to any child.'"
 The remote learning guidance is based on recommendations from a 63-member advisory group of teachers, students, paraprofessionals, related service personnel, principals, and district and regional superintendents. Each district is to interpret the guidance individually and come up with a plan that fits their district.
 The emergency rules on remote learning days allow for e-learning or other kinds of remote learning days, which must be approved by the school's or district's superintendent or chief administrator.
 A district's remote learning plan must consider: student access to remote or online instruction; that activities reflect state learning standards when applicable; the means by which students confer with an educator as needed; the unique needs of students in special populations; and the transition from remote learning to on-site learning when remote days are no longer necessary.
 Per the guidance, remote learning can be "real-time or flexibility timed," and it "may or may not involve technology."
 "It cannot be assumed that every family or every student has access to the necessary devices and appropriate internet connection at their home. In many cases, students categorized as 'at risk' by schools are the ones without access to devices or reliable internet," according to the guidance.
 Per the recommendations, students should have the opportunity to "redo, make up, or try again to complete, show progress, or attempt to complete work assigned prior to the remote learning period in that time frame."
 "We continue to be awed by the phenomenal creativity, resilience, empathy, and problem-solving prowess of Illinois' educators, administrators, and students," Ayala said in a news release. "The stories we see every day on social media, in the news, and in our email show us just how focused our educators are on supporting our children in this time of crisis."
 The full remote learning recommendations can be viewed at www.isbe.net/Documents/RL-Recommendations-3-27-20.pdf.
 Schools are also allotted up to five "Remote Learning Planning Days" after March 30 to plan in partnership with their collective bargaining units.
 The remote learning and planning days count as actual student attendance days toward the required minimum for a school year and will not need to be made up, just like "Act of God" days, which is how canceled school days were counted from March 17 to March 30.
 Teachers and other public school staff will continue to be paid as part of a deal between education associations and unions negotiated by the Pritzker administration and ISBE, and state funding from the evidence-based formula will be unaffected.
 The same executive order pertaining to remote learning days also canceled testing requirements in the state, including for the SAT.
 A release from the ISBE said it recognizes that the free SAT offered by the state is often the only opportunity for students to take a college entrance exam, and it is working on plans to allow 11th grade students to take the SAT in the fall.
 ISBE also released a joint guidance statement with the Illinois Board of Higher Education and Illinois Community College Board on dual credit courses.
 It stated, "Dual credit instruction should continue, if at all possible, during the suspension of in-person instruction, or resume as soon as possible, to ensure students are able to meet the objectives of the dual credit course. However, that instruction must not negatively impact a student's academic standing."
 For AP classes, for the 2019-20 exam administration only, students may take a 45-minute online exam at home "on any device they have access to -- computer, tablet, or smartphone," per another guidance document from ISBE.
 That document said questions are designed in ways that prevent cheating, and the College Board is using a range of digital security tools and techniques, including plagiarism detection software.

You build your negativity deck without recognizing it, and that becomes your lens for most situations. Your negativity bias can squeeze the life out of you and diminish your verve for life. It can restrain you from taking on new challenges, forming new relationships or deepening intimacy with old ones. But when you reshuffle your negativity deck and stack it with positivity, you have the cumulative benefit of unlocking a range of options. It’s essential to be intentional about shifting your negativity bias, make an effort to look for and experience positive emotions and savor them much like you would an ice cream cone. Here are 10 actions to stir your optimistic juices, stack the cards in your favor and embrace the perspective less taken:

The Fed’s action to stimulate the economy by lowering the Federal Funds rate can, in fact, exacerbate this problem. When central banks lower the policy rate (i.e., the Fed funds rate), interest rates across the board come down. Therefore, there is very little that investors lose by parking their money into cash or safe short-term Treasury bills, compared to investing the same money in the long-term government bonds or corporate securities. Combined with heightened risk-aversion, the lower opportunity cost of hoarding cash or cash- like assets pushes the interest rate further down.

That way, the company does not get into a turf battle with Hyundai across all SUV segments. We mean the upcoming Kia Sonet will take on the Hyundai Venue, the Seltos and the Creta go head to head and the Sorento maybe could be the flagship Kia SUV and Hyundai steers clear of the idea of bringing the Santa Fe to India. That way, at the top of the SUV pyramid, the Hyundai Palisade will have one competitor less and there will be some breathing space.

Wall Street was set to open sharply lower on Wednesday, as dire predictions on the U.S. death toll and worsening economic damage from the coronavirus pandemic led investors to ditch equities for safe-haven assets. The S&P; 500 and Dow Jones indexes ended Tuesday with their worst opening quarters in history as efforts to contain the virus resulted in store closures, massive staff furloughs and a virtual halt in business activity.
 The benchmark index has lost about $5.6 trillion in market value so far this year, despite an unprecedented round of fiscal and monetary stimulus that helped equity markets claw back some of the losses last week. On Tuesday, U.S. President Donald Trump warned Americans of a tough two weeks ahead, with White House health officials modeling an enormous jump in virus-related deaths even with strict social distancing measures.
 "There is no easy way to quantify either the economic shutdown or what the eventual recovery is going to look like as the monetary and fiscal policy initiatives are as historic as the economic decline," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities in New York. With the quarterly earnings season set to begin in two weeks, investors fear reports of more production cuts as demand across sectors including airlines, autos, luxury goods and industrials evaporates, raising the risk of corporate defaults.
 S&P; 500 companies are expected to enter an earnings recession in 2020, with declines in profit in the first and second quarters, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Annual earnings are expected to fall 2%, the first decline since 2009. In the second quarter alone, profits at S&P; 500 firms are projected to slide 9.6%.
 In the latest sign of the economic toll of the health crisis, U.S. private payrolls dropped in March for the first time since 2017, supporting views that the longest employment boom in history ended last month. "Talk of a bottom in equity markets still seems remarkably premature given the continued increase in infection and death rates across Europe and the United States," said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets in London.
 At 08:36 a.m. EDT, Dow e-minis were down 761 points, or 3.50%, S&P; 500 e-minis were down 87.5 points, or 3.41% and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 215 points, or 2.76%.

 The Sarasota Y was the first organization we joined when we moved to Sarasota in December of 2015. In fact, it was only our second day in town.
 We worked out there every day and enjoyed getting to know many of the members who have such diverse and interesting personal stories. Our two oldest boys completed their lifeguard/first aid/CPR training at the Y under Ken Diffendefer, a name familiar to many in the community, and our middle son later worked at the Y as a lifeguard. Our youngest son swam with the Sharks team.
 As a family, our membership at the Y has allowed us to not only maintain our personal fitness goals but also to get to know an array of individuals that span several generations. It truly serves as a kind of melting pot where members come together as a social congregation -- not only to sweat together, but to support and encourage one another.
 When we received the email last summer that the Y would be closing its doors, we were shocked. The place is always packed and so vibrant -- we simply couldn't un-derstand why it would be closing based upon its census and the social good it does for our community. We didn't want to simply join another gym because we love the Y. It had become more than a place to work out, although it is an excellent fitness center; we realized it provided much more nourishment than the opportunity to get our cardio going.
 As the new Save Our Y organization was trying to rebuild from scratch, we connected with the new president and CEO, as well as some of the new board members, to identify where they had the most need and what we could do that would be most helpful to them as an organization. We felt passionate about helping them get to a place where they could do what they do best.
 We initially made a modest sustaining donation, but after learning from the new leadership of the pivotal nature of the facility ownership and financing thereof -- which has created understandable angst amongst the membership -- we decided that we needed to step up and help financially at this crucial moment. By doing so, we felt that our gift could impact the larger community in a meaningful way.
 That the final result is one that benefits not only Y members, but the outstanding work of Safe Children Coalition and the entire community, is a powerful testament of what can be accomplished when people have a commitment to collaboration for the betterment of the community.
 We are hopeful that the community will continue to rally in support of this local treasure. And we are confident that Our Y will continue to foster multigenerational interaction and learning between community members, as well as support the physi-cal, mental and emotional wellness of members of the Sarasota community for many years to come. It was truly dollars well spent.
  _Libby and Jon Soderberg have individual and joint histories with various Ys from Australia to New York to Princeton, New Jersey, and now Sarasota. Libby will bring that experience to the Our Y board of directors as its newest member. Gifts of $500,000 each from the Soderbergs and an anonymous donor made it possible for Our Y to complete the purchase of its two Sarasota facilities from the Safe Children Coalition on March 25._

COVID-19 disruption has brought out TV news and digital as champions as the country deals with the 21-day lockdown. TV news showcased a 57% growth in viewership at all India level. The growth showcased across all major languages.
 As India grapples with a new way of life -- with social distancing and work- from0home becoming a norm -- it is impossible to not see the impact of all of this on media consumption. Over the last few weeks, social distancing, and staying at home has had a significant effect on media consumption across the country.
 Demand for content on both TV and digital spiked during COVID-19 disruption period and advertisers remain upbeat about the two mediums.
 According to BARC-Nielsen data, total TV consumption grew by 8 percent across India during COVID-19 disruption period.
 This data further revealed that Indians are spending more time on TV to watch news, GECs (general entertainment channels) and movies. These three genres have contributed the most in the spike in viewership on TV during COVID-19 week, which is the week starting March 14.
 In terms of viewership, TV news saw 57 percent growth in viewership across India and the growth was witnessed across all major languages.
 The daily average reach of the news genre on TV grew by 34 percent, highest amid all categories.
 "Television is the screen of the households and under these circumstances, household is glued to TV," says Sunil Lulla, CEO, BARC India. "The audience, they don't have anywhere else to go. What do you have surprisingly is even kids are watching news. So there is big growth in news. The consumers trust the news which is on TV. They know it is credible. Hence, they are watching it continuously," he adds.
 In fact, Network18 channels recorded a 50 percent growth in average daily reach during week 1 of the COVID-19 outbreak. During the same period, Network18 reached out to more than 10 crore TV viewers on a daily basis.
 One growth factor is that news is the only medium which is producing new content.
 But on the other side when it comes to General Entertainment channels or GECs there is no fresh content. The production of new episodes has stopped leaving GECs with no choice but to play repeats of their old shows.
 Mediums such as Radio and OHH have also taken a hit due to lack of adequate drive time on the roads, print is facing a massive distribution problem and cinemas are shut. In this scenario, digital has emerged as a shining star.
 As a part of Comscore's ongoing investigation into the COVID-19 and its impact on the media and advertising industry around the world, they recently released a study focusing on key areas of digital consumption.
 As per the insights from this study, in India, compared with the week of Feb. 10-16, 2020 visits to websites and mobile apps in the 'General News' category increased by 61% in the week of March 16-22, 2020. However, most of the increase occurred recently: compared with the week of March 9-15, 2020, visits went up by 50% during the week of March 16-22, 2020.
 Also, the study states how as financial markets fluctuated with the spread of the pandemic, the reach of, and engagement with, digital content within the 'Business News' category have surged. The number of unique visitors increased by 22% between the weeks of March 9-15, 2020 and March 16-22, 2020, while the increase in total visits was 34%, and total minutes increased by 27%.
 Vikram Sakhuja, CEO, Madison World, feels that from an environment standpoint, it is a good time for advertisers to use digital.
 "The number of people who are there on the online space have increased. Today, a large percentage of digital advertising that is bought is bought on biddable platforms. So if there is going to be more audience out there, you can actually lower your big price and you can target better, you can geographically go to various places plus you can get the audience for a lower cost per thousand than you are used to."
 But many experts feel that since big spenders such as FMCG are dealing with distribution crisis owing to countrywide lockdown, there is not much to advertise. But would it be the right time to build brands on platforms that are watched and followed so extensively?
 "If you have some good messages, it is a great time to advertise because people are receptive," says Sakhuja. He is also of the opinion that it's also a great time for a brand to build trust.
 Now, Over the Top or OTT platforms have also seen a spike in the viewership. But way forward is it going to be a smooth ride for video streaming platforms as producers are delaying the release of their new films and their originals are also lagging as the content production industry has canceled all the shoots?
 Ashish Pherwani, Partner and Media & Entertainment Leader, EY India feels it is time for OTT players and producers to rethink.
 "We are seeing that there are so many movies that got produced last year which never got a release. And we see a lot of value in that library now," Pherwani says.
 He adds that this trend has in fact started last year but there might be a chance of many digital-first releases by producers this year. "But, many big producers will still be waiting for a big theatrical release first."
 But even as overall viewership and audience has spiked, the industry faces uncertainty from a fall in advertising revenues.
 All the major media planning agencies are revising their ad spend forecast which was predicted between 10% to 11% for 2020 to single digits and are unsure of when the situation will crawl back to normal.
 "Everyone is fighting a battle of survival. The first focus is on safety and getting through this period in a proper way. You are going to be geared up for comeback but it will comeback only very slowly," says Ashish Bhasin, CEO APAC and Chairman India, Dentsu Aegis Network.

Job searches related to remote working have witnessed a jump of over 261 per cent amid the coronavirus lockdown, a report said. Job seekers are increasingly searching for terms like remote, work from home and related phrases, with searches for remote work witnessing an increase of over 261 per cent since February, according to data from job site Indeed. The overall job searches have increased by 278 per cent on Indeed India since September 2019, it added. Flexibility has always been a vital aspect of job opportunities to job seekers, especially millennial, who today make up over half of Indias working population. In challenging times like these, being able to continue working remotely serves as an asset, not only to the job seekers skill set but also in helping the organization maintain business, Pawel Adrjan, Economist at Indeed said. A previous study by Indeed India showed that 83 per cent of job seekers consider remote work policy an important factor when searching for a job, so much so that 53 per cent of employees would consider taking a pay cut in order to have access to remote working options. About 56 per cent of employees and 83 per cent of employers concur that offering flexibility in working can help boost productivity, it added.

Your car is your second home. If there were a graph showing the places you spend most of your time, your workplace and your bed would be two of the big hitters, with the supermarket wine aisle (not judging anyone!) and your car coming in at regular third and fourth places. Getting around is an overlooked time-blackhole. As my dear old gran used to say, always have comfy shoes and comfy sheets, because if you’re not in one you’re in the other. Solid advice. But I’d go one further - have a comfortable car setting. Keeping your car tidy, well ventilated, smelling nice, and stocked with water or mints or gum can relax you and help you to reduce road rage.

“Regardless of any short-term effects from changes in traffic volume on the mortality rates of wildlife,” she said, “it is important for us to provide safe crossing structures such as underpasses and overpasses to connect populations and habitats. This will help to ensure wildlife species and communities persist in the long term.”
 So far, research biologists have seen no evidence that Southern California’s increasingly isolated and inbred populations of mountain lions are benefiting from far fewer vehicles on freeways cutting across their ever-shrinking islands of habitat.
 “There is no evidence that the animals that we’re tracking are crossing freeways any more in the last couple of weeks,” said Seth P. D. Riley, wildlife ecologist and branch chief for the National Park Service’s Santa Monica Mountains Recreation Area. “But that is not too surprising — it is a very short time frame.”
 Mountain lions are not endangered in California, but groups living in the Santa Monica and Santa Ana ranges now find themselves in genetic peril. Separated by nearly impenetrable freeways and lethal traffic, they are unable to travel and are growing increasingly rare and inbred, researchers say.
 The California Fish and Game Commission on April 16 is expected to decide whether to recommend listing lion populations in Central and Southern California as a state endangered species.
 In the meantime, the National Center for Sustainable Transportation and the Institute of Transportation Studies at UC Davis have made funding requests to support research aimed at probing deeper into the positive and negative impacts of the pandemic on social rhythms of life.
 “As the shelter in place order extends over months,” Shilling said, “we hope to answer pressing questions such as this one: What are the cost-savings and other social benefits from reduced injuries and deaths on state highways due to COVID-19?”

The Sarasota Y was the first organization we joined when we moved to Sarasota in December of 2015. In fact, it was only our second day in town.
   
 We worked out there every day and enjoyed getting to know many of the members who have such diverse and interesting personal stories. Our two oldest boys completed their lifeguard/first aid/CPR training at the Y under Ken Diffendefer, a name familiar to many in the community, and our middle son later worked at the Y as a lifeguard. Our youngest son swam with the Sharks team.
   
 As a family, our membership at the Y has allowed us to not only maintain our personal fitness goals but also to get to know an array of individuals that span several generations. It truly serves as a kind of melting pot where members come together as a social congregation -- not only to sweat together, but to support and encourage one another.
   
 When we received the email last summer that the Y would be closing its doors, we were shocked. The place is always packed and so vibrant -- we simply couldn't un-derstand why it would be closing based upon its census and the social good it does for our community. We didn't want to simply join another gym because we love the Y. It had become more than a place to work out, although it is an excellent fitness center; we realized it provided much more nourishment than the opportunity to get our cardio going.
   
 As the new Save Our Y organization was trying to rebuild from scratch, we connected with the new president and CEO, as well as some of the new board members, to identify where they had the most need and what we could do that would be most helpful to them as an organization. We felt passionate about helping them get to a place where they could do what they do best.
   
 We initially made a modest sustaining donation, but after learning from the new leadership of the pivotal nature of the facility ownership and financing thereof -- which has created understandable angst amongst the membership -- we decided that we needed to step up and help financially at this crucial moment. By doing so, we felt that our gift could impact the larger community in a meaningful way.
   
 That the final result is one that benefits not only Y members, but the outstanding work of Safe Children Coalition and the entire community, is a powerful testament of what can be accomplished when people have a commitment to collaboration for the betterment of the community.
   
 We are hopeful that the community will continue to rally in support of this local treasure. And we are confident that Our Y will continue to foster multigenerational interaction and learning between community members, as well as support the physi-cal, mental and emotional wellness of members of the Sarasota community for many years to come. It was truly dollars well spent.
   
 Libby and Jon Soderberg have individual and joint histories with various Ys from Australia to New York to Princeton, New Jersey, and now Sarasota. Libby will bring that experience to the Our Y board of directors as its newest member. Gifts of $500,000 each from the Soderbergs and an anonymous donor made it possible for Our Y to complete the purchase of its two Sarasota facilities from the Safe Children Coalition on March 25.

We are all evaluating the next steps as we speak. There are no movies worth mentioning that skip theaters and go straight to digital, but I'm sure conversations are taking place.

If the cinemas continue to close after April, we will witness a complete change in what this business will be like over the next 12 months.
