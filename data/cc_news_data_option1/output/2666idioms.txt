With Young under arrest, a subsequent search of the vehicle produced an eyeglasses case which contained suspected meth and marijuana as well as a meth pipe and syringe. According PCSO, methamphetamine was also located under the passenger seat of the vehicle. Young as well as his passengers, Farmer and Henry, all denied that any of the drugs or paraphernalia belonged to them — leading to all three being charged and being transported to the Pulaski County Detention Center.


  As the driver, Young was additionally charged with Operating a Motor Vehicle Under the Influence of Alcohol/Drugs (2nd Offense), second-degree Driving on a DUI Suspended License, and Reckless Driving.


  The case remains under investigation by Dep. Hudson.

Eventually, Microsoft recognised that UWP was a failure. The original Microsoft Edge was written in UWP, and Microsoft abandoned it and developed a newer browser based on open-source Chromium.


  Joe Belfiore, corporate vice president of Microsoft’s experiences and devices division, explained the decision this way, “It’s not that UWP is bad, but UWP is not a 35-year-old mature platform that a ridiculously huge amount of apps have been written to.”


  These days, the Microsoft Store in Windows still offers mainly UWP apps, though you can occasionally find a Win32 app. But it doesn’t have many of the best and most important Win32 apps. Want the most popular Windows browser, Chrome? You won’t find it in the Microsoft Store.


  How about Adobe Reader? Nope, not there. How about the great clean-up utility CCleaner, the Dropbox cloud application or the excellent malware killer Malwarebytes? No, no and no. Want to videoconference using Zoom in Windows 10? Correct, you’ll have to find it somewhere else.


  If Microsoft can’t make its store in Windows truly useful, it should do away with it. Unless the company can improve it, it’s time to pull the plug.

An elderly widow discovered dead in her home in suburban Hobart twice refused treatment from paramedics in the two days beforehand.


  Feryne Gaylene Hunter, 75, suffered a tracheostomy blockage and was found lifeless in bed by a nurse on the morning of September 13, 2017.


  Mrs Hunter, who had a history of coughing up blood clots, had been visited by nurses, paramedics and police over successive days.


  In findings published on Wednesday, Coroner Olivia McTaggart said nothing could have reasonably been done by health professionals to prevent Mrs Hunter's death and all parties acted lawfully.


  However, she recommended Ambulance Tasmania rewrite its refusal of treatment and transport policy, describing it as "confusing".


  Ms McTaggart said simple and clear guidance should be given to paramedics on how to deal with issues relating to patient capacity, consent and refusal of treatment.


  Mrs Hunter had been visited by nurses three times a week for six years after a throat infection forced her to have a tracheostomy in 2007.


  An ambulance was called to her house on September 11 by a visiting nurse who noted she was having trouble breathing.


  Mrs Hunter refused to be transported to hospital but agreed to make a GP appointment the next day.


  Paramedic notes indicate she was told of the risks associated with staying home and had capacity to refuse treatment.


  The following day Mrs Hunter was visited by police who were accidentally called to her house at night by a man whose phone was erroneously linked to the address.


  When officers arrived, they saw Mrs Hunter hunched over on stairs inside and breathing heavily.


  They called an ambulance but Mrs Hunter told them to "all go away", refusing to consent to paramedic treatment and telling them she was fine


  She denied having chest pain, with medical notes indicating her speech was clear and continuous, leaving paramedics satisfied she had the capacity to refuse treatment.


  Mrs Hunter was found dead the next morning.


  "I cannot speculate why Mrs Hunter did not wish to accept medical treatment ... but I am satisfied that she had the ability to call for assistance when she required it," Ms McTaggart wrote.


  Ms McTaggart noted ambulance paramedics who arrived on the 12th had "no ground lawfully" to do anything other than what they did.


  "They were presented with a situation whereby Mrs Hunter persistently refused to be clinically assessed," she wrote.


  "(She) was able to coherently communicate those wishes to them.


  "On the evidence, the best medical care was to transport Mrs Hunter to hospital for treatment.


  "However, in light of her refusal of assessment and treatment, this course would not have been lawful."


  Ms McTaggart wrote Ambulance Tasmania had identified that the refusal of treatment and transport policy provided limited advice as to how paramedics should manage situations like Mrs Hunter's.


  Ambulance Tasmania has been contacted for comment.

The landlord is caught between a rock and a hard place.


   


  On one side there is a couple who is paying no rent, tearing a house apart and refusing to leave. On the other is the state of Illinois, which won't let her give them the boot.


   


  "It's horrible," she says.


   


  Gov. JB Pritzker's coronavirus-triggered executive order prohibits evictions. Every time the order nears expiration, the landlord's hopes she'll get her house back without any further damage. But with each extension, the wreckage increases.


   


  "it's chaos," she says.


   


  She never planned to be a landlord. She is 64 and an avid churchgoer. Moreover, she lives out her faith, often lending a hand to lift others up.


   


  That's what prompted her to open up the only residence she owns in Peoria. About six years ago, she bought a quaint dwelling in the North Valley. Now 100 years old, the structure looks crisp outside, with sharp siding and painted accents. Inside, the throwback design and woodwork oozed plenty of charm.


   


  "lt was cozy," she says. "It was cute. Everyone said it was so peaceful. Everyone liked coming to visit."


   


  About four years ago, she met a 30-something woman who had been struggling with drugs. She befriended the younger gal, eventually giving her rides to Bible studies and other church events. In good times, the younger woman sounded determined to lick her habit. But she'd periodically slip up and vanish, riding out another storm with drugs.


   


  "I'd call and leave a message to say that somebody cares and that I was praying for her," the older woman says.


   


  Eventually, the younger woman would reappear in the life of the older woman, who would offer encouragement and advice. The cycle would continue, as the old woman never gave up.


   


  Late last year, the younger woman was living with a man with whom she has had a rocky, long-term, off-and-on relationship -- with drugs often triggering problems for the pair. They lived in a horrid rental house, a hovel rife with mold, roaches and other repugnance.


   


  Still, with no lease to hold them down, they could move if they could somehow find a better and affordable place elsewhere. So, as the new year began, the older woman had an idea to try to help them.


   


  She wanted to sell her comfy North Valley residence and move to Rockford, to be near relatives. In fact, she'd already found a new home there. She planned to slowly transition to Rockford, then put the Peoria property up for sale in mid-March.


   


  So, she made an offer to the couple. From mid-January to mid-March, they could rent her place, which was a huge step up from their unsanitary surroundings. Meantime, they could search for a permanent place to live.


   


  The older woman made it clear that the arrangement was only temporary. She drew up a $600-a-month lease for two months, stressing that the couple would have to leave by mid-March. They agreed and moved in.


   


  Suddenly a landlord, the older woman soon found trouble afoot. When she would to the home to continue moving belongings to Rockford, the place would be in filthy disarray. She'd clean up, only to return days later and find a new mess.


   


  Things got worse, as damage repeatedly rocked the house. A TV set got busted, as did a coffee table. A counter was discolored by bleach and gouged with razors, the result of drug use. A door got smashed; a hole was punched inside a closet to hide drugs. A carpet turned from gold to black, from unexplained and repeated spills. And on and on.


   


  What was going on? Along with drugs, the couple faced paranoia and delusions. Fright and anger turned to violence and destruction. When the landlord questioned their behavior, they ignored her.


   


  Meantime, weeks went by. The couple had paid $300 up front, then nothing more. When the landlord asked about rent, they laughed in her face and -- with absurd irony --suggested, "You should be paying us to watch your house."


   


  She repeatedly told them to leave. They refused.


   


  She threatened to cut off power and water, which were in the landlord's name. They threaten to retaliate by ripping apart the house even more. So she kept paying the utilities.


   


  She wanted to evict them, clean things up and sell the house. But then came the cornoavirus and the governor's order, which prohibited evictions. The thinking was, people who lost their livelihoods shouldn't lose their residence as well.


   


  Maybe that makes sense in some cases. But the spirit of the order had nothing to do with debacle at the North Valley house. The coronavirus had nothing to do with the continued destruction.


   


  Yet the landlord was stuck.


   


  In part, the no-eviction section of the state order offers some exceptions. Most relatable to the North Valley landlord's conundrum, it exempts tenants who pose "an immediate and severe risk to property."


   


  Could she win an eviction based on those grounds? The landlord asked a lawyer, who said she stood little chance, as the order is so heavily weighted toward tenants.


   


  Agreeing is Paul Arena, legislative director for the Illinois Rental Property Owners Association. His group supports a lawsuit filed by landlords seeking to end the eviction moratorium. Arena says though the governor's initial intentions might've been good, a great many non-paying renters have gotten unemployment benefits or new jobs -- but simply are refusing to pay rent. Further, he says, many landlords are losing their shirts for a lack of income.


   


  Meantime, there are landlords -- like the North Valley homeowner -- who have no practical remedy to address other issues like property destruction. As for the exception regarding "an immediate and severe risk to property," that's subject to a judge's interpretation. Plus, Arena says, how can a landlord prove who did the damage? Photos won't help, as a tenant could just shrug and claim, "That's how the place looked when I moved in."


   


  The governor's office did not reply to a request for comment regarding this matter.


   


  In the landlords' suit, a hearing for a temporary retraining order is set for July 15. But if that fails, the North Valley woman has almost no recourse.


   


  Last week, the executive order was extended to July 26. That's a long time, allowing the chance for a lot more damage, maybe even more so if the order gets extended again.


   


  "There's nothing I can do," she says.

  Since winning the mayoral election in 2014, Spanish-born Anne Hidalgo has been at the forefront of global climate action, waging war against cars and pushing pro-pedestrian and pro-bike policies as part of her vision for a greener Paris. In her perspective, reducing pollution and improving air quality will not only give Parisians healthier lives but also make the city a more pleasant place to visit, particularly as tourism continues to rise. On her watch, large stretches of the left and right banks of the Seine River, which served as intercity expressways for decades, have been cleared of cars and reopened as urban parks where pedestrians can stroll, exercise, or hang out. She has also overhauled streets to add to the city’s 400-plus miles of dedicated bike lanes, increased access for disabled people, reconfigured iconic squares to incorporate walkways and green space, and committed to banning all combustion-engine vehicles by 2030. Car-dependent locals and Hidalgo’s political opponents accuse her of being a radical who is trying to alter the face of a storied city. But to those concerned about sustainability, she’s driving necessary change.

Following the service, the entertainment for the evening was the Hutchinson Brothers Band and then Journey tribute band Departure, who put on an energetic show, performing classic hits like “Lights,” “Faithfully,” “Feeling That Way,” and “Don’t Stop Believin’.” Just as Departure was ending their set, this year’s Freedom Festival closed with the city’s annual fireworks display.


  Aside from the numerous scheduled events, this year’s festival looked much the same as it always does, despite being somewhat scaled back — with most of the same food and drink vendors, merchandise vendors, and a carnival provided by Buckhannon-based company Gambill Amusements Inc. In between each ride, employees of Gambill Amusements could be seen spraying down and sanitizing the rides before the next patrons got on.


  Inflatables, a rock wall and gold rush sifting adventure, a puppet show complete with a live pig and goat, and several characters around town, which included a sad clown and a juggling woman on stilts, were also all part of this year’s festival. Additionally, this year featured various points of entry throughout the town, each of which included optional hand sanitizer, masks, and gloves.


  Despite less attendance due to community fears surrounding the ongoing global pandemic, Mayor Serafino Nolletti remarked that the festival was “fantastic” and came without any problems. He estimated attendance at this year’s festival was 30% down from last year, noting that some vendors reported almost no loss, while others reported upwards of a 40% drop.


  “We knew there would be less people in attendance, but all in all, it was great,” Nolletti said. “Everybody that attended had a great time. All our entertainers, every year, these entertainers come from different parts and they all fall in love with Logan and the people in Logan.”


  “All in all, the weather was great, it was perfect,” Nolletti added. “We’re looking forward to next year, and hopefully this pandemic will be behind us, and we can get back to business and everybody in the country can get back to business like we want it.”


  Just like he did last week before the festival opened, Nolletti addressed negative sentiments some citizens had toward the festival, taking aim primarily at the claim that the city makes money from the festival.


  “The people that have donated money, they knew this year was going to be a tough year, and we got a lot of people step up and helped us financially to pay for it,” Nolletti said. “A lot of people think the city spends money on this and makes money on this … not the case, I mean, I don’t know where they get this information from. I think people just talk because they like talking I guess, but they need to come and see me if they want to see where the money comes from. I can provide that. If they wanted to come see me face to face, these people get out there and run their mouth on social media, come and see me, I’ll show them in black and white if they need to.”

Microsoft, in a ham-handed way, tried to portray closing the stores as a victory because…well, it’s hard to know _why_ the company considers it a victory.


  In an attempt at spin control, David Porter, Microsoft corporate vice president of the Microsoft Store, said in a blog post that the company had “announced a strategic change in our retail operations, including closing Microsoft Store physical locations.” What’s the big strategic change apart from closing the physical retail stores – and why is that better for consumers?


  Porter didn’t say.


  As big a failure as the Microsoft Stores have been, the _real_ store Microsoft should have axed is the one built into Windows for downloading software. You say you never used it? Join the club. The Microsoft Store in Windows has never had a solid collection of downloadable software — and is largely filled with underpowered apps that people simply don’t want to use.


  The problem was baked in from the beginning. Nearly eight years ago, when writing about the original store, I noted, that it “...seems as barren of goods as a Romanian grocery store during the depths of the Ceausescu regime."


  There were many reasons for that. A primary one was that for most of the download store’s life, the only apps allowed in were those built with what Microsoft calls the Universal Windows Platform (UWP). UWP was part of Windows 8, and in those days, Microsoft believed its Windows Phone would become the dominant mobile operating system.


  The idea was that developers would build apps using UWP, and the apps would run on both Windows 8 and Windows Phone. In Microsoft’s worldview, software written for the Windows Desktop, called Win32 apps, would slowly fade away, while UWP apps would conquer the world.


  Things didn’t turn out that way, of course. Windows Phone failed miserably. Developers stayed away from UWP apps in droves, and the store continued to have plenty of empty virtual shelves. Win32 apps still rule the world, and the apps Microsoft did develop for UWP were exceedingly underpowered.


  Though there were plans to release a UWP version of Office, that never happened. Microsoft wrote an app it called Office, but it wasn’t Office. Instead, it was supposed to be a companion to Office.


  What did it do? Here’s the description from the Microsoft Store: “The Office app enables you to get the most out of Office by helping you find all your Office apps and files in one place so you can jump quickly into your work.”


  Not exactly groundbreaking — or particularly useful.


  So few developers wrote UWP apps for the Microsoft Store that at one point Microsoft essentially bribed them to do so. In early 2013, it launched a promotion in which it paid $100 to developers to send UWP apps to the Windows Store. Each developer could get up to $200 – $100 per app.


  Microsoft was so hungry to stock those software shelves that it did a terrible job of vetting them for quality and safety. An investigation found in 2014 that "Microsoft’s Windows Store is a mess. It’s full of apps that exist only to scam people and take their money. Why doesn’t Microsoft care that their flagship app store is such a cesspool?"

The US exposure is obviously the most substantial, even beyond spending from the Commonwealth, simply due to the sheer size of US military spending. The political risks here are myriad, where one relates to the optics of military spending in times of crisis, especially when the US is showing poorer results regarding its management of the Covid-19 situation. This could lead to Trump suspending spending increases for defense purposes if he keeps office, on top of intentions to reduce spending compared to European nations, while European nations are also officially stating that they intend to lower the budget allocations for defense purposes.


  Another concern, still related to the coronavirus, is its impact on Trump's re-election prospects. Markets are already realising the modest risk that US spending could decrease as a result of losing the presidency to the Democrats. With markets and real economy in an uncertain state, unstable under the geyser that is central bank accommodation, it is similarly uncertain what sentiment voters will have on elections day. Without Trump in office, flexing to get allies and the US to spend more on defense products, relevant risks are especially faced by companies like BAE which are likely to be much lower priority in the contractor pecking order.


  Similarly, Saudi Arabia is under pressure. In the oil crash, their margins were obviously taking a massive hit, despite their fabled low breakeven price. Indeed, now we're seeing some austerity measures coming into play as they try to defend their economic surplus. With Saudi Arabia entirely reliant on US goodwill to continue in their questionable, autocratic ways, a commitment to spending on US defense products is politically more valuable than earning goodwill with the Brits through spending on their contractors. With concerns around Russian discipline with oil cuts, on top of remaining uncertainty around the breadth and depth of Covid-19, the state of Saudi finances continues to be unsure. As such, BAE substantial exposure to Saudi Arabia is also more vulnerable than US peers.

Birth certificates have been coming in slowly during the pandemic, and Boxford opted not to issue marriage intention certificates during this time, but the town has been doing a booming business in dog licenses.


  In fact, Boxford has processed as many dog licenses, including both new and renewals, during the first half of 2020 as the town would normally see in an entire year.


  Boxford Town Clerk Robin Phelan said that when her office was sending out a second round of census notices during the early spring, it was a perfect opportunity to remind residents about dog registrations.


  "We got a clean response, better than it's ever been for both the census and dog license returns," Phelan said. "We have more dog licenses than ever before, with 1,500 registered by June, which is the number we usually have in December."


  That's probably because people were home during the COVID-19 shutdowns.


  Although COVID-19 has not been listed on the death certificates of Boxford residents that came from local funeral homes, Phelan said the town has seen a higher number of deaths so far this year. Many of this year's death certificates have listed the cause of death as respiratory failure or pneumonia, and Phelan speculated that some of them may very well have been related to COVID-19.


  So far in 2020 in Boxford, there have been a total of 28 deaths, Phelan said, and during this same period in 2019 there were only 23.


  Boxford birth certificates were slow to come in during the early lockdown period, said Phelan, but she is optimistic that the record-keeping is now getting up to speed as the town clerks where hospitals are located are forwarding the paperwork.


  Noting that Boxford chose not to issue marriage intention certificates during the pandemic, Phelan said she sent brides- and grooms-to-be to nearby towns such as Middleton where the town clerks were offering the service.


  While some of the work Phelan and her staff do could be completed on computers at home, Phelan said all state business has to be done on a computer in the office at Town Hall.


  "We were able to access our emails at home, record births and deaths, and hit the print icon so that when we came into Town Hall, the documents were ready and waiting for us," Phelan said.


  Since Boxford Town Hall is still closed, Phelan said pet owners are encouraged to fill out dog registrations online at the town website, www.town.boxford.ma.us/. The tags and paperwork, she said, will be mailed to them.

The authors say that periodic natural shifts in precipitation are driven by complex, interlocking patterns of atmospheric circulation on land and at sea. One key factor: low-level westerly winds that blow moisture onto the continent from the Pacific. These are controlled in part by periodic cyclic changes in sea-surface temperatures over both the Pacific and the Atlantic, which can bring both droughts and wet periods. The authors say greenhouse-gas-driven shifts in these patterns appear linked to a still continuing 10-year drought over central Chile and western Argentina that has caused severe water shortages, along with heavier than normal rains in eastern regions.

CHARLESTON — Fatal overdoses seem to be dropping in West Virginia, though those related to methamphetamine remain on the rise, according to data compiled by the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources.


  Preliminary numbers suggest that a total of 849 West Virginians died of overdoses in 2019, a 6% decrease from 2018, when 906 people died. The new numbers are a 16% drop from 2017, when overdose deaths in West Virginia topped more than 1,000 — with 1,019 dead — for the first time.


  The overdose death data is compiled from causes of death reported on death certificates certified by the Office of the Chief Medical Officer and are not final, meaning numbers could rise as more death certificates are analyzed.


  Bob Hansen, head of the West Virginia Office of Drug Control Policy, said those looking at the data sets, compiled in June, should have two main takeaways.


  “One is the trend in seeing the rise in (methamphetamine use), and two is realizing that we still have a long way to go. Our rate compared to the national average (of fatal overdoses) is still higher,” Hansen said. “Even though we see some good numbers and a positive trend, we’ve got to keep at it.”


  While opioid-related overdose deaths seem to be slowly decreasing in the state — down to 78% of all overdose deaths in 2019 compared to 85% in 2017 — meth-related overdose deaths totaled 372 in 2019, a 60% increase from 2017.


  Hansen said this isn’t unexpected, as crackdowns on pill mill pharmacies and illegal prescription practices have led to a decrease in prescription opioid use and a potential increase in demand for other drugs.


  “Counter to that reduction (in prescription opioids), which we love to see, is the growth of meth, and that’s very scary,” Hansen said. “We can see that it looks like in West Virginia, drug usage is changing, but it points to that people are using a variety of substances, and we can definitely see a trend of meth being present in many of these fatalities.”


  Raleigh and Logan counties lead the state in the rate of fatal overdoses involving meth. Between 2017 and 2019, Raleigh County’s rate more than tripled, from 17 per 100,000 dying from meth-related overdoses to 57 per 100,000.


  Logan County’s rate in 2019 was five times higher than that of two years earlier, up to 48 per 100,000 people dying in the county after using meth last year compared to just nine per 100,000 in 2017.


  Hansen said there are several challenges that can make it difficult to help people struggling with addiction to meth compared to addiction to opioids.


  For one, he said, there aren’t as many evidence-based practices available for meth addiction.

URBANDALE — Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said Tuesday she is re-examining the state’s response to COVID-19 in light of the growing positive cases, particularly among young adults.
 Between June 21 to July 5, Reynolds said 82,000 Iowans received COVID-19 tests. About 60% of the positive cases stemmed from adults ages 18 to 40. In comparison, only 21% of middle-aged adults and 2% of the elderly tested positive for the virus.
 Reynolds said she is analyzing the state’s seven- and 14-day trends with Dr. Caitlin Pedati to decide whether any additional proclamations are needed to mitigate COVID-19. She gave a coronavirus update during her weekly news conference on Tuesday.

If someone is addicted to opioids, they can benefit from a number of different therapies, including medically assisted treatment, a type of recovery process that utilizes therapy in conjunction with medication like buprenorphine. While an opioid, buprenorphine works by stimulating the same brain receptors affected by other opioids, but it does not produce any mental or physical impairments.


  There’s also no equivalent to naloxone, an opioid overdose reversing drug, for meth.


  Hansen said these are issues the state is exploring as drug use trends become more clear.


  “We’ve been focused so intently on opioids for a long time, and the landscape of drug use in West Virginia is changing,” Hansen said. “We’re just kind of gravitating that way — to training and better understanding the dynamics of using meth, and the clinical approaches that work. This year we plan to roll out different types of training and support so treatment programs can adapt to people using multiple substances and meth.”


  While 2019 was the second consecutive year with a decrease in the number of people who died from overdoses in West Virginia, there’s no guarantee what 2020’s numbers will look like. There’s a chance overdoses, including fatal, could be on the rise as stressors brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic cause people with substance use disorders to relapse or possibly use for the first time.


  In May 2020, paramedics across West Virginia responded to 923 calls about people suspected of suffering an overdose, a nearly 50% increase over last May and 200 calls more than in any other month in the past two years, according to the ODCP.


  Local groups, like Kanawha County’s Solutions Oriented Addiction Response, or SOAR, report that they’ve seen a 400% increase in the number of people overdosing and being revived with naloxone since March, the beginning of the pandemic in West Virginia.


  In Cabell County, medical professionals are also reporting overdose increases.


  There’s no way to know how many of these overdoses will be fatal until the data is collected and released by the state next year.


  In the meantime, Hansen said, local agencies and the state should remain focused on providing access to materials and services that can keep people safe from overdosing. That means more naloxone training sessions and hand- outs, the continuation of quick response teams and ensuring there are beds and resources available for people who are ready and willing to get help for substance use disorder.


  None of this is easy during a pandemic, Hansen said, but it’s necessary.


  “We don’t know what next year will look like. It’s all up in the air,” Hansen said. “For now — this is a good trend. As long as we keep going down from the 2017 numbers, that’s good news. We’ve got to keep working on this issue every day, though, so we can reduce fatalities more. This is a good trend. We just have to keep it up.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's June began with his Bible- clutching photo op outside a church after authorities used chemicals and batons to scatter peaceful demonstrators. It never got less jarring or divisive.


  By month's end, he was downplaying a coronavirus pandemic upsurge that was forcing Western and Southern states to throttle back their partial reopening of businesses. And Republican strategists already straining to retain Senate control in November's elections were conceding that Trump's performance could make it harder to defend their majority.


  One said key Republicans were telling Trump they're worried about his campaign and he should heed polls showing him in trouble. Another pointed to surveys showing diminished public optimism and many voters' views that Trump is poorly managing the surging virus and languishing economy. Still another said Republicans worry the GOP brand of cutting taxes could be overshadowed by Trump's drive to defend Confederate monuments.


  All spoke on condition of anonymity to describe internal GOP thinking, and each said Republican prospects for holding the Senate remain viable. Yet their willingness to discuss the problem, plus carefully worded assessments by Republican senators and others in the party, highlight GOP worries about a June that saw Trump feed inflammatory rhetoric to his deeply conservative base, risking support from more moderate voters.


  "In all elections, the political environment shapes how things come out, and sometimes you can't control that," No. 2 Senate Republican leader John Thune of South Dakota said last week. He said GOP candidates "need to do what they need to do to win. And in some states, he will be a benefit in some parts of the country. In other parts of the country, less so."


  "It is the reason the president is sitting behind in the polls right now, because he can't stay on a message that is a unified message and one that is a positive one for the country," Rick Santorum, a former GOP Pennsylvania senator who challenged Trump for the party's 2016 presidential nomination, said Tuesday on CNN's "New Day."


  Republicans control the Senate 53-47. Democrats must gain three seats to gain the majority if they win the White House because of the vice president's tie- breaking vote, four if they don't.


  Even measured against the warp-speed news cycle now routine under Trump, June was remarkable.


  He repeatedly used cataclysmic language to denigrate nationwide protests for social justice, mostly peaceful gatherings that he cast as mobs unleashing violence. He called for the U.S. military to "dominate" the streets of American cities, drawing rebukes from military leaders and his own current and former top Defense Department officials.


  He held his first campaign rally in the coronavirus era in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where many in a modest crowd that Trump aides said would be far larger wore no masks. Critics called him racially insensitive for choosing a city that saw one of the 20th century's worst spasms of racial violence and originally scheduling it on June 19, date of the Juneteenth holiday celebrating the end of slavery in the United States.


  John Bolton, his former national security adviser, released a book claiming Trump asked China's president to buy more farm products to bolster his reelection. Trump also used the month to refuse to erase Confederate commanders' names from U.S. military bases, retweet an image of a Florida supporter shouting, "White power!" and question reports that Russia had placed bounties on U.S. troops in Afghanistan.


  "Republican Senate candidates will have to defend things President Trump says and does between now and Election Day," said Rory Cooper, a Republican strategist and longtime Trump foe. Cooper said many Trump positions "are toxic to mainstream voters and will make down-ballot Republican candidates equally toxic."


  Trump's June outbursts came as polls showed him trailing presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden nationally and in several battleground states. A Gallup poll released Monday showed Trump with a dangerously low 38% job approval rating.


  Trump trailed in nearly all 2016 surveys until late in that campaign.


  Both parties envision tight Senate races in closely divided states where moderate suburban voters, who have abandoned the GOP over Trump's penchant for sowing discord, could be key. These include Sens. Cory Gardner of Colorado and Martha McSally of Arizona, often seen as their party's most vulnerable incumbents.


  Also facing competitive reelections are GOP Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Susan Collins of Maine, Joni Ernst of Iowa and Steve Daines of Montana. Both Georgia Republican senators, particularly Kelly Loeffler, may see close races. Sen. Doug Jones of solidly Republican Alabama is considered Democrats' most endangered incumbent.


  Republicans must defend 23 Senate seats to Democrats' 12. But several Democratic challengers have posted strong fundraising numbers this year, including Amy McGrath in Kentucky, Mark Kelly in Arizona and Sara Gideon in Maine. Democrat Jaime Harrison, waging an uphill fight to topple three-term South Carolina GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham, said he'd raised nearly $14 million over the past three months.


  To Democrats, June merely underscores how this fall's presidential and congressional elections will be dominated by how Trump is viewed by voters.


  "I think to a significant degree, this campaign is about Donald Trump vs. Donald Trump. And I think Trump is losing," said Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who lost a bid for this year's Democratic presidential nod.


  Stewart Boss, spokesperson of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said GOP candidates would be damaged because they've been "unwilling to be a check" on Trump. Jesse Hunt, spokesperson for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said Republicans "are well positioned to draw important contrasts" against Democrats.


  Scott Reed, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's senior political strategist, said Trump has enunciated "zero" about his second-term agenda and should correct that. He said he believes independent swing voters abandoning Trump will be willing to back GOP Senate candidates and expressed cautious optimism.


  "It's going to be tough" to hold the Senate, Reed said. "Republicans are playing defense across the board, but they're good defensive players."

Her instinct was right.


  Later that morning Sims returned claiming someone had stolen it.


  “As soon as I heard the voice I said ‘That was you in my room.”


  Sims denied being the intruder but Essix says it’s the only thing in this bizarre story that makes sense.


  “So how you come back to where they stole you’re car? You was in my room.”


  Mobile police say Sims told officers he did not remember going into Essix home because he was intoxicated.


  Sims is now in jail but the family is still on edge knowing he lives right around the corner and they say he threatened to do it again when he went back the next morning and got into a fight with another family member.


  Sims has an extremely long wrap sheet stretching all the way back to 1997.


  This time he is charged with burglary and violating his probation.


  Essix says this is a lesson for her family and others out there to always make sure your doors are locked.

Curlers across the country can get back on the ice thanks to Curling Canada's return to play guidelines.


  Stressing the importance of following local protocols, Curling Canada released their detailed return to play report, officially opening the door for organizations to begin scheduling, this past week.


  "I'm pleased to tell you there is a path forward as we plan for the next curling season, and we all can play a role in bringing curling back to Canadians," said Katherine Henderson, CEO of Curling Canada. "We can also learn from this experience and find ways to make our sport, and our business, better."


  Before the first stones are thrown, rinks will have to make a few modifications to bring themselves up to speed with the new guidelines. Rinks must post their occupancy limit based on provincial guidelines.


  All rinks must undertake a thorough cleaning before they will be permitted to open.


  Where possible, Curling Canada expects rink managers to identify separate doors for entrance and exiting, and to place markers on the ground indicating a path from the entrance, on to the ice, back off of the ice, and to the exit.


  Rinks may have to expand lounge space to provide additional dressing rooms or tell athletes to come prepared to curl.


  "(Organizations can) Check with local authorities about the use of locker rooms. They may have to insist on players arrive at the rink ready to play if access to locker rooms is restricted."


  There will also be a number of changes to the on-ice process, which will ensure physical distancing and allow curlers to participate without being a part of a 50 person sports cohort.


  The Alberta Government's guidelines currently state anyone participating in a sport where physical distancing cannot be followed must do so within a cohort of 50 people. Curling Canada's guidelines will allow for larger events or bonspiels.


  All curlers must sign a Declaration of Compliance plus a Waiver (signed by adults) or Assumption of Risk Form (signed by adults on behalf of minors). Curlers should maintain physical distancing at all times.


  "Players stay on the same side of the sheet. For example, if they are playing on sheet 2, they will always walk or position themselves on the sideline to sheet 1. This will keep players 10 feet apart," the return to play report reads.


  Markings will be placed on each rink to allow for physical distancing.


  The two sweepers of the non-delivering team will be positioned on a set of markings while the other team is throwing. The player of the non-delivering team whose turn it is next to deliver should be positioned at the hogline on the same side as the two sweepers. The skip (or vice-skip) will stand on the backboards but no closer than the hack.


  On the delivering team, the skip has control of the house. The player whose turn it is to deliver is in the hack. The non-sweeping player is on the backboards. The sweeping player is at the T-line.


  Once the stone has been released, the player who delivered the stone proceeds down the centre line of the ice until the halfway point to the marking or to the hog line if it is their turn next. After the stone comes to rest, the sweeper proceeds to the halfway markings. The non-sweeper travels to the halfway mark or the hog line depending on their turn to deliver or not.


  There will only be one sweeper permitted on all delivered stones, relaying will be prohibited.


  "Yes, there will be some changes in the way we operate our curling centres, and many of those changes may reflect a new reality. But I truly believe our sport is well-positioned to cater to Canadians seeking that place of welcome, warmth and fun," Henderson said.


  Each curler will select their own two rocks and will only be permitted to touch their own rocks. Rocks will be sanitized at the end of every draw.


  There will be no shaking hands and participants will be encouraged to start the game with a friendly tap of brooms. The usual coin toss will also be replaced either by the league convenor deciding the last stone advantage in the first end or by an electronic coin-tossing app.


  Rental equipment will be allowed but must be sanitized after every use.


  "We've been urging Canadians to keep curling at home with commercials you may have seen on TSN. Now, the message will shift to simply keep curling, and working together with all of you. We are committed to getting Canada back on the ice this fall," said Henderson.


  There has currently been no word from either of the local curling clubs on the possibility of a relaunch date.

The Fourth of July was not quite the same this year, with the Boston Pops pushed off the Hatch Shell stage and online like many other aspects of pandemic life.
 The fireworks did not be explode over the Charles River. And there was no pre- dawn rush to lay down a blanket and claim a space on the Esplanade.
 Regardless of warnings from public officials like Boston Mayor Marty Walsh to keep the fuses unlit, residents made their own shows with Roman Candles and other illegal fireworks.
 Bay State residents are increasingly trying to make the best of summer, with Cape Cod leaders reporting spikes in traffic over the bridges, and beaches and hiking trails luring social-distanced sunbathers and outdoor entertainment seekers in record numbers. Gov. Charlie Baker did his part for the tourism industry early last week by easing up on the state's travel guidance.
 In light of successes in controlling the spread of coronavirus within their own borders, Baker said anyone coming from any of the other five New England states or New York or New Jersey would no longer be asked to self-quarantine for 14 days.
 "It's our hope that many folks will still be able to visit their favorite places in our great state," Baker said.
 Massachusetts continues to see positive trends in its fight against COVID-19, including the first day in a long time this week when no new deaths from the virus were reported by the Department of Public Health. So even as New York City Mayor Bill DeBlasio and New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy took a look at the infection surges in states like Florida and pulled back on their plans for indoor dining, Baker plowed ahead with his own phased reopening.
 The governor announced that Phase 3, including the reopening of gyms, movie theaters, museums, casinos and professional sports, would begin on Monday. The state also revised its gathering-size limits to permit up to 25 people indoors and up to 100 outdoors.
 Still, the governor said the progress the state has made in reopening should not be mistaken for a license to go back to life as it was known before March.
 "I can't repeat this enough - there's no victory lap here," the governor said during a press conference Wednesday, July 1. "There's no spiking the ball, there's no big celebration at home plate, there's none of that, OK."
 Two people who are not waiting to see what phase they'll fit into are U.S. Sen. Edward Markey and U.S. Rep. Joseph Kennedy III. The 2020 election is very much on, and the two Democrats vying for a U.S. Senate seat are looking at a runway of eight weeks to the primary.
 Markey said he will enter that stretch with $4.8 million to spend, followed closely behind by Kennedy's $4.7 million in the bank.
 Not only were their bank accounts virtually identical in size, but Markey and Kennedy both reported raising $1.9 million in the second quarter, although Kennedy's campaign was quick to point out it suspended fundraising activities for over a month during the height of the outbreak.
 Kennedy has also already spent $2.4 million on television advertising to reach self-quarantining voters over the past two months, while Markey has yet to go up on television.
 To ensure that as many voters as possible feel comfortable voting in two months, House and Senate negotiators struck a deal this week to expand vote- by-mail and establish early voting before both the primary and general elections.
 The bill on its way to Gov. Baker's desk last week directed Secretary of State William Galvin to send every registered voter an application to request a mail-in ballot for the primary on Sept. 1.
 It turns out no matter how they choose to cast their ballot, voters will only have to render a verdict on two initiative petitions - whether to allow ranked-choice voting and if independent auto mechanics should have all-access passes to a car's digital data. Cumberland Farms last Friday night said it was dropping its push to allow more food stores to sell beer and wine, and this week organizers behind a ballot initiative to force more spending on nursing homes abandoned their initiative.
 While Cumberland Farms blamed the pandemic and the need it created for the company to focus on the health and safety of its workers, climate activists this week made a hard sell for why policymakers should not let the response to COVID-19 become all-consuming.
 Former Secretary of State John Kerry lent his voice to that cause last Wednesday, phoning in a Senate committee hearing to urge state legislators to get a bill to Gov. Charlie Baker's desk to address climate change before the end of the month.
 "We're not getting the job done. When I say we, I mean collectively everybody - parliaments, legislators, presidents, prime ministers," Kerry said.
 The rapidly closing window for legislative action this session was noted by more than just climate advocates.
 Thirty-seven House progressives wrote to Senate President Karen Spilka urging her to let the Senate vote on the House's tax bill to raise money to improve the state's transportation system. The liberal Democrats said Spilka's reluctance to put that bill on the floor or offer an alternative was not just depriving public transit of needed funding, but undercutting any case progressives might try to make for raising additional tax money to stave off budget cuts due to the pandemic.
 The full impact from the coronavirus on the state budget is still a major question mark, and the new fiscal year - FY 2021 - began on Wednesday without even the whisper of a spending plan forthcoming from the Legislature.
 Treasurer Deborah Goldberg tapped into a line of credit for $500 million to make sure the state has enough cash on hand to continue covering its expenses as another month of local aid payments went out the door and budget writers waited for uncertain federal relief and the postponed July 15 tax filing deadline to arrive.
 In the meantime, the House and Senate sent Gov. Baker legislation to extend the MBTA's Fiscal and Management Control Board for another year and to authorize $200 million in borrowing for local road repairs.
 Extensions are pretty much the default for the Legislature at this point, with lawmakers also agreeing to another year of horse racing and simulcast wagering at the tracks rather than figuring out a long-term licensing solution for what's left of the racing industry in Massachusetts.
 The Senate also passed a $1 billion COVID-19 relief bill and a more than $1 billion bond bill for information technology upgrades, including funding to support schools with remote learning.
 Final versions of those bills must now be negotiated with the House.

Eventually, Microsoft recognised that UWP was a failure. The original Microsoft Edge was written in UWP, and Microsoft abandoned it and developed a newer browser based on open-source Chromium.


  Joe Belfiore, corporate vice president of Microsoft’s experiences and devices division, explained the decision this way, “It’s not that UWP is bad, but UWP is not a 35-year-old mature platform that a ridiculously huge amount of apps have been written to.”


  These days, the Microsoft Store in Windows still offers mainly UWP apps, though you can occasionally find a Win32 app. But it doesn’t have many of the best and most important Win32 apps. Want the most popular Windows browser, Chrome? You won’t find it in the Microsoft Store.

IN APRIL 2011 I wrote an op-ed for the Union Leader that stated, in part, “Donald Trump is not a credible candidate for President and if the GOP allows him to hijack the primary process then they deserve exactly what they get.”
 Note the date — 2011, nearly a decade ago. At the time Trump was coming to New Hampshire to dip his toes in the 2012 presidential waters. He was scared away by Mitt Romney and didn’t run.
 Four years later, he came back and took advantage of a crowded field, a divided party, a tired nation, and a particularly poor Democratic nominee, to make his way to the White House. And we have lived with the consequences ever since.
 If it was just the Republican party who carried the burden, it would be OK, but it’s not. An entire nation is suffering at the hands of his narcissistic incompetence.
 When I warned against him in 2011, I wrote about the ludicrous suggestion that he could solve the trade problems with China, his reality TV show character, and his $50,000 campaign contributions to Rahm Emanuel. That all seems like small potatoes after watching him actually be President for 3.5 years.
 For example, it never crossed my mind that he would be the leader of the free world during a global pandemic.
 Trump is returning to the state this weekend for a reelection campaign rally and everything is different. He is an incumbent who is in trouble and he knows it.
 As Granite Staters look back over his first administration they see immigrant children crowded in cages, an impeached president who tried to bribe a foreign leader to influence an American election, over 130,000 American lives lost (so far) to a pandemic that was grossly and selfishly mismanaged, racial unrest fanned by a president who retweets white power videos, and more Americans out of work in June than any June in U.S. history.
 Since winning the 2016 election, Trump has revealed himself to be much worse than “just” a misogynist who believes he has the right to grope women at will. He is a dangerously weak and insecure wannabe despot desperate for the approval of tyrants.
 He is a social media bully who is expert at diverting your attention with fabricated insults and by stirring racial and social unrest in order to distract from the very real damage of his pathetic ineptitude. He defends the Confederacy over the U.S. Constitution and wants you to believe that by violently dispersing peaceful protesters in order to have a photo taken in front of a church he is somehow defending religious freedom.
 And through it all, most of my fellow Republicans have stood silent.
 In 2016 there were at least some elected Republicans willing to stand up to Trump. Then-Senator Kelly Ayotte refused to support Trump on election day, saying, in part, “I’m a mom and an American first, and I cannot and will not support a candidate for president who brags about degrading and assaulting women…”
 I was proud to stand with her and defend her at that moment for having the courage to do what was right regardless of the cost. There are few such elected Republicans left today, willing to put country over party and protect principle over the President.
 Perhaps worst of all, we just recently learned that Donald Trump, while President of the United States of America, ignored warnings that Vladimir Putin was paying bounties for the killing of American soldiers in battle. He has known for over a year and done nothing. America’s sons and daughters, warriors in a volunteer army, defending our nation, were targeted by one of the world’s most dangerous dictators, and Donald Trump stood impotent and silent.
 Even in that moment, there was little in the way of recrimination from Republicans.
 Freedom’s greatest foe is not those from outside our country who would do us harm, but those within who stand silent in the face of such betrayal from our own president.
 That is the Donald Trump who is coming to New Hampshire this weekend. That’s the Donald Trump who is asking you to wear his red hats, carry his signs, defend his racism, ignore his betrayals, and give him the extraordinary privilege of your vote.
 When those that we send to the halls of Congress refuse to defend the constitution and preserve the republic, then we the people must do so ourselves at the ballot box. Donald Trump wants you to vote for his ugly, divisive, damaging vision of our country, but I know we are better than that.
 I too am a mom and an American first, and I won’t do it.

"One is the ability for American people to use this medicine to protect themselves and two, the ability for hospitals like the Detroit Hospital System to recruit patients for the kind of randomized blind clinical trials that everybody wants to settle once and for all the questions of efficacy and safety," he added.

In any event, the green movement, which had top billing on the news agenda at least up until March, has had to take a back seat as the world fights a pandemic. So when does the former scientist – Appel obtained a PhD in neurobiology – expect normality to resume?
