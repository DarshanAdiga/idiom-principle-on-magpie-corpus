She was a hardworking, loving wife and mother and will be remembered by family and friends for her humour and kindness, her amazing cream puffs, pies, cakes and cookies.      Muriel enjoyed fishing with her husband, horseshoe pitching and lawn bowling. She loved getting together with family and friends and a good game of Skipbo or cribbage.      Her last two years were spent in Hillside Care Home and she was very happy there, she loved the staff and felt that they were a part of her extended family.

Himachal Pradesh governor Bandaru Dattateaya has requested the Centre to expedite granting investment clearance to the 40MW Renukaji Dam project so that its proposal gets approved from the cabinet committee on economic affairs (CCEA) and construction can be started soon.
 In a written communique to Union minister for Jal Shakti, water resources, river development and Ganga rejuvenation Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, the governor said that the state is committed towards fulfilling the objectives of the project and all technical clearances have been obtained.
 He said statutory clearances including environmental and forest clearance Stage-1 of the project have also been obtained.
 "Only forest clearance Stage-II is left, which will be obtained after getting funds from Centre and subsequent deposition of Rs 577.62 crore in the state compensatory afforestation (CAMPA) fund account," he said.
 Dattatraya said the project is of national importance and will provide 0.498 BCM live storage in its reservoir and water supply to the tune of 23 cusecs to Delhi.
 Six states of the Yamuna basin - Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan - will benefit from the project, he added.

MILWAUKEE (AP) — The Milwaukee Brewers want to celebrate their golden anniversary by accomplishing something they have never done before.
 After reaching the National League Championship Series in 2018 and falling in the NL wild-card game last year, the Brewers are seeking an unprecedented third straight playoff berth during this unusual 60-game season.
 The Brewers launched their franchise in 1970. Their only previous back-to-back playoff appearances before the last two years came in 1981-82. Now they will try to make history while dealing with the challenges of playing through a pandemic.
 “This year we’ll have to be more connected than we’ve ever been,” outfielder/first baseman Ryan Braun said. “There’s no other choice. I think it’s something we’ve embraced over the last couple years - something that’s allowed us to probably exceed outside expectations.’’
 That shorter schedule also means the Brewers must start fast this season after benefiting from September surges the last two years.
 It’s worth noting the Brewers led the NL Central through 60 games each of the last two years: They were 37-23 in 2018 and 34-26 last year.

Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders held out invites to Sachin Pilot, offering to welcome the Congress leader into the saffron fold after he was stripped off his status as chief of the party unit in Rajasthan and the deputy chief minister earlier in the day."If anybody with a mass base joins the BJP or any political party, everybody welcomes him. Expressing trust in our ideology, if anybody joins us we will welcome him with open arms. This is a normal procedure," Union Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat said, according to news agency PTI soon after Pilot was dropped from the Ashok Gehlot cabinet on Tuesday afternoon.Former union minister of state PP Chaudhary said he expected more people from the Congress to join Pilot."So many people joining Sachin is a big thing, and I believe more will join him. BJP's doors are open for everybody if he believes in our ideology. If Sachin Pilot joins us, I don't think there will be any problem. Our national leadership, though, will take the final call," PTI quoted Chaudhary as saying.Chaudhary, however, added that the national leadership will ultimately decide if such a union was possible.A leader aware of developments said the senior BJP leaders including former chief minister Vasundhara Raje will hold discussions over the current political situation in the state tomorrow after the virtual split in the Congress legislature party following Pilot's removal.The BJP has indicated that it is adopting a hands-off approach and keenly watching the unfolding of political situation in Rajasthan. The party believes that it is time for the Gehlot government to go after the rebellion led by Sachin Pilot who appears to have the support of nearly 16 MLAs.Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot has blamed the BJP for ensnaring Pilot to destabilise the government, a charge that the BJP has rejected. The BJP says the entire episode is a "film" that had been in planning for the last 6 months and was "directed, produced, and acted in" by Ashok Gehlot himself, who, it claimed, had "successfully plotted" Sachin Pilot's "ouster" from the party.Earlier a BJP leader in Delhi, who spoke on condition of anonymity, had said that the party will not seek a floor test unless it is confident that both Gehlot and Pilot factions are falling short of numbers.BJP leaders have also claimed the party has neither formally contacted Pilot nor had been approached by him.Another BJP leader Baijayant Jay Panda tweeted about "every experienced pilot" being aware of an "alternate air strip to land" in the event of technical problems, triggering a fresh round of speculations.While it has been reported that Sachin has ruled out joining the BJP and could instead be considering floating a regional outfit, he has not made any formal announcement of his plans yet. Pilot is expected to address a Press conference tomorrow morning at 11 when he may outline his next steps.While the Congress currently appears to have enough numbers to save the government, the difference between winning and losing could be wafer thin. In a 200-member house, Congress has 107 MLAs and the BJP 72, with Gehlot claiming support of several independent and other parties' MLAs as well. However, Pilot's camp has claimed that he enjoys support of around 30 MLAs and that if true, could prove to be a decisive factor.

Air travel within the United States fell 95% from the start of March until mid-April, when fewer than 100,000 people boarded airline planes on some days, down from more than 2 million a day a year earlier. That rose to more than 700,000 on the best days, but it has hit a plateau in July, coinciding with increased COVID-19 cases across the Sun Belt.Delta, along with Southwest and JetBlue, has limited capacity to about 60% on domestic flights. United and American don’t block seats.Airline customers have historically put a priority on fare prices, but Bastian thinks that could be changing. Customers are telling the airline they are uncomfortable boarding packed planes, and fully booking flights “is not what Delta is going to do,” he said.Delta has promised to cap seating through Sept. 30.Three passengers tested positive for COVID-19 the day after a July 6 Delta regional flight from Atlanta to Albany, New York, prompting New York officials to recommend that other passengers contact their local health authorities. Bastian said such events are “rare,” but didn’t say how many times it’s happened.All major U.S. airlines now require passengers to wear face coverings, which gained new attention this week when Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, was photographed without a mask on board an American Airlines flight. Cruz was holding a coffee cup, and airlines let passengers remove masks to eat or drink, but American said it reached out to Cruz to remind him of its policy.Bastian said when people don’t wear masks, “they quickly get pointed out” by other passengers.Delta depends on business travel for an outsized share of its revenue and profit. Bastian acknowledged that corporate travel will be slower to recover than leisure as in-person meetings are replaced by Zoom calls.Delta’s second-quarter loss compared with a year-ago profit of $1.44 billion during what is normally a strong season for airlines.The loss included more than $2 billion in write-downs for Delta’s investments in Latam Airlines, the biggest carrier in Latin America, and Aeromexico and Virgin Atlantic. All have filed for bankruptcy or the equivalent.Excluding those items, Delta said its adjusted loss worked out to $3.9 billion, or $4.43 per share, wider than the $4.16 industry analysts surveyed by FactSet had expected.Revenue nosedived to $1.47 billion, down from $12.54 billion last year.Delta is getting $5.4 billion in federal aid to help pay workers through Sept. 30 and has been offered a $4.6 billion loan by the Treasury. It hasn't decided whether to take the money because it could find better terms on the private market.Delta shares fell 3% Tuesday.___David Koenig can be reached at www.twitter.com/airlinewriterCopyright 2020 Associated Press.

New Delhi:
 A Delhi court on Tuesday allowed foreign nationals from five countries who had attended the Tablighi Jamaat congregation at Nizamuddin Markaz to walk free after they entered into a plea bargaining agreement and accepted milder charges. Another court also granted bail to 150 foreigners from Indonesia.
 A plea bargain is an arrangement between the prosecutor and accused, whereby the latter pleads guilty to a lesser charge in exchange for a more lenient sentence, or an agreement to drop other charges.
 Metropolitan Magistrate Dev Choudhary allowed foreigners from Djibouti, Mali, Kenya and 17 Sri Lankans to walk free on payment of a fine of Rs 5,000 each, said advocate Ashima Mandla, who appearing for them.
 Metropolitan Magistrate Akash allowed a few Myanmar nationals to walk free on payment of a fine of 5,000 each, while others claimed trial before the court, their counsel Fahim Khan said.
 Three Sri Lankans and other foreigners from Nigeria and Tanzania claimed trial before the court, the lawyer said.
 Meanwhile, another court granted bail to 150 foreign nationals from Indonesia who were charge-sheeted for attending the Tablighi Jamaat congregation here, allegedly in violation of visa norms and violating government guidelines issued in the wake of Covid-19 outbreak.
 Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Gurmohina Kaur granted relief to the foreigners on furnishing a personal bond of Rs 10,000 each.
 To date, 682 foreign nationals from 35 different countries, who were charge- sheeted in the case, have been granted bail by the court.
 The police had in June filed 59 charge sheets, including supplementary ones, against 956 foreigners belonging to 36 different countries in the case.
 The accused, who was granted bail on Tuesday, will file their plea bargaining applications on Wednesday, said advocates Ashima Mandla, Mandakini Singh and Fahim Khan, appearing for them.
 During cognisance of the charge sheets on July 6, the court was informed by the Investigating Officer (IO) that the 956 accused were investigated for charges of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, and criminal conspiracy to endanger life or personal safety of others."However, to date, no evidence has come against the foreigners for these," the investigation officer told the court.
 The police had filed charge sheets against 956 foreigners from 36 countries, including 122 Mayalsians, for violating visa rules, violating government guidelines issued in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and regulations regarding Epidemic diseases Act, Disaster Management Act and prohibitory orders under section 144 of Code of Criminal Procedure.
 They were accused of offences under sections 188 (Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (Negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), 270 (Malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 271 (Disobedience to quarantine rule) of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of the Foreigners Act.

"His elusiveness is second to none. It seemed like every time I tried to land a big shot, he was already 10 steps ahead of me, and he’s by far the best defensive fighter I've faced. His lateral movement, I've never seen anything like it. You don't really know how good Floyd's feet are until you fight him. He's very fast on his feet which makes him hard to hit. If you watch the first few rounds of our fight, you see that I was winning on the inside. Floyd thought I wasn't going to have much power as I was coming up from 122 pounds. He was trying to stand his ground and fight me on the inside in the first two rounds, but I caught him with a nice body blow and he made the adjustment. He certainly used his brain to win the fight. He put everything together and made the proper adjustments in all his fights. He's not the biggest puncher, but his skills are arguably the best ever. Floyd is the total package. His superior speed, ring IQ and fast feet make him very difficult to beat, hence the reason he retired undefeated. No one was ever able to figure him out."

Congress leader Sanjay Jha who was removed as the party spokesperson last month for a newspaper article was suspended from the Congress late on Tuesday. A two-line note issued by the Maharashtra unit said Jha was being suspended with immediate effect for what it described as "anti- party activities and breach of discipline".The Congress statement did not outline the charge against Sanjay Jha. It is not clear if his suspension is linked to the barrage of tweets and statements over the ongoing Ashok Gehlot vs Sachin Pilot playing out in Rajasthan.Jha backed Pilot who had been removed as Rajasthan deputy chief minister and the party's state unit president just hours earlier. In tweets and his statements to television channels, Sanjay Jha was critical of how the Congress is being run and spoken of disillusionment within the party.But Sanjay Jha had been tweeting in support of Pilot for a few days, crediting him with rebuilding the party from 2014 when he was inducted as the Rajasthan Congress chief. Jha, a familiar face of the Congress on television debates, was sacked as the party spokesperson's post after he wrote an article that was severely critical of the party leadership. In this, he has contradicted the party's claim that the Congress has an internal platform for frank exchange of ideas and counter-ideas to get the party back on track.He has worn the party's decision to remove him as spokesperson as a badge of honour on his Twitter profile but insisted that he did not intend to jump ship and stay with the Congress. Later, he even tweeted that he would throw his hat in the ring as a candidate for the Congress Working Committee - the highest decision-making body in the grand old party - "as and when there are elections".To be sure, Sachin Pilot and the two ministers dropped from Ashok Gehlot's cabinet earlier on Tuesday also continue to remain in the party. The Congress hasn't suspended or expelled them. But it is clear that their continuation in the party is going to be untenable.

"Mayweather had his strengths: his technique, his movement, he was just a very good boxer. He's smart and he knows when to go in and when not to. He won't take any chances, he won't listen to the crowd and get himself riled up. He stuck with his game plan because Mayweather is more a slick counter puncher, you just can't hit him. Floyd was able to get off the gun really quick, and while I felt like I was competing with him, I would have to say that he had the fastest hands of anyone that I've fought. He knows how to change up the fight and the tempo in the middle of the fight. He can go from one thing and one strategy to another very well. If you get one thing working, he can change up and make you have to do something else. He was probably the smartest. It's how he evades punches with a blend of his defense and his offense. He’s always on his toes and he's always slipping and sliding. Floyd was the best overall fighter. He had the most speed, a good jab the best defense and a good offense. It's also what he does with his movement and his angles. To be fair, he caught me later in my career, but he put everything together, offensively and defensively, and he has the movement."

New Delhi [India], July 13 (ANI): Former Union Minister and BJP MP PP Chaudhary on Monday said the ongoing political crisis in Rajasthan is "internal struggle of power politics that has cost the state, which is now lagging in development."   Asked if there is a possibility of Sachin Pilot joining the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Chaudhary quickly said, "We have crores of members in our party. Our doors are open for everyone."   The BJP leader also commented on Pilot's statement of having the support of 30 Congress MLAs. "If he (Pilot) is saying Gehlot government is in minority then we should take his statement seriously," said Chaudhury.   The crisis in Rajasthan Congress intensified with Gehlot and his deputy Sachin Pilot at loggerheads. While Gehlot is blaming BJP for trying to destabilise the state government by poaching MLAs, Pilot is camping in Delhi to speak to the party leadership regarding the political turmoil in the state.   The Congress Legislative Party (CLP) has issued a whip to its MLAs to attend a meeting today in Jaipur and will face disciplinary action if they are absent without mentioning a reason, Rajasthan Congress in-charge Avinash Pande said here today.   Congress has 107 MLAs and the Gehlot government is supported by 10 Independent MLAs and two each from the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the Bharatiya Tribal Party while BJP has 72 seats in the 200-member Assembly.   As many as 30 Congress MLAs and some independent legislators who are in touch with Sachin Pilot have pledged their support to him and have vouched to stand by whatever decision he takes, sources said.

Following his arrest on Tuesday, Vikas Dubey's alleged aide Shashikant alias Sonu Pandey denied killing DSP Devendra Mishra and said the slain gangster had ordered the firing at the police team that raided his house on the night intervening July 2 and 3. Pandey made the claims to a TV news channel while being taken away by the police after his arrest. On being asked who killed DSP Mishra, he told the new channel that he did not kill him."They (policemen) were killed very brutally (badi berahami se maara gayaa)," Pandey told the channel in a very feeble voice.When asked why did he flee from his house and why did he get his head tonsured, he said, "My mother told me to run away (Maa ne bhagaa diyaa thaa). I got my head tonsured because my father (Prem Kumar Pandey) is no more." Prem Kumar Pandey was killed in the encounter with the police in Bikru village.Two of Vikas Dubey's alleged accomplices, Prem Prakash Pandey and Atul Dubey, were killed by the police in a shootout in Kanpur.When asked how the firing was started from the rooftop of Dubey's house, Shashikant said, "It was immediately ordered (on the raid by the police team). Vikas Dubey gave the orders." In response to a question by the reporter, Pandey said, "He (Dubey) did not spare anyone." On being asked if "he (Dubey) also used to target girls", Pandey replied in positive. Pandey was arrested and two rifles of the Uttar Pradesh police, looted during the Kanpur ambush earlier this month, were also recovered, police said on Tuesday. With this, all weapons looted during the ambush have been recovered, they said. Additional Director General of Police (Law and Order) Prashant Kumar said Dubey's aide Shashikant alias Sonu Pandey was carrying a reward of Rs 50,000 on his arrest. "Shashikant Pandey was an accused in the killing of the eight policemen (in the Kanpur ambush). He was arrested from Chaubeypur around 2.50 am," the police officer told reporters in Kanpur. "During interrogation, he admitted to his involvement in the encounter at Bikru village in Kanpur dehat. It was revealed that the looted AK-47 of police was hidden in Dubey's house while the INSAS rifle was at Shashikant's house," the ADG said.

Left turns off north Vine onto 45th Street will be allowed starting later this fall.
   
 Construction on the $80,000 redo of the existing intersection there will start later this summer or early fall, according to city project manager John Braun.
   
 The construction will take about six weeks, Braun said in a briefing Thursday to the Hays City Commission where commissioners approved the project.
   
 Right now, no left turns are allowed where 45th enters onto Vine. With a median block access, it remains a busy area where cars come and go on the way to Walmart, restaurants and other businesses that have popped up there over the years.
   
 "The intersection has right-in, right-out access only and allows no left turn onto or off of Vine Street from 45th Street," Braun told commissioners.
   
 The intersection as it is now was constructed in 2007 as part of a system enhancement project by the Kansas Department of Transportation, he said.
   
 A new three-quarter intersection will allow left turns off of Vine Street for north- and southbound traffic.
   
 Left turns will still be prohibited onto Vine Street, he said.
   
 "Future peak traffic volume estimates are somewhere in the 220 vehicle per hour turning left off of Vine onto westbound 45th," Braun told the commissioners during their regular meeting.
   
 A three-quarter intersection at 45th is the next level up from right-in right- out access, he said, allowing some access to businesses, but still keeping conflict points on the busy highway to a minimum.
   
 City Commissioner Sandy Jacobs indicated the three-quarter intersection will also benefit traffic a few blocks south on Vine.
   
 "I think it's a great idea," Jacobs said. "The traffic that comes south into Hays is minimal compared to the mess that I think there is at 43rd. So I think you're going to see a lot of people head on up to that next intersection and be able to turn in without having to stop at a stoplight. I think it's going to be a huge improvement in that area."
   
 She asked Braun if he's talked to the businesses around 45th Street about the redo.
   
 "There's been talk of it over the years," Braun said. "It has been brought up numerous times in various different settings and various different meetings how it would be beneficial to businesses in that area if that left turn movement were allowed off Vine."
   
 The work will be done in-house by the city services department, starting with demolition and removal of the existing median, then salvaging landscaping, followed by six weeks of construction.
   
 Commissioner Ron Mellick asked why a three-quarter intersection wasn't built in 2007.
   
 Braun said access along Vine has evolved over the years under KDOT planning and review, since the four-lane thoroughfare through Hays is also US-183 highway.
   
 "You can actually see the progression of access management if you look at Vine Street from the south north," Braun said. "At the south end it's kind of Wild West, so to speak, it's free-for-all, intersections everywhere."
   
 Then between 27th and Interstate 70 there are frontage roads, which allow less direct access to Vine.
   
 "Then when you look north of I-70, you have the reverse access roads, which are set back, and you have even less access to Vine Street," he said, which allows highway traffic to flow freely.
   
 That's been at the expense of businesses along there, he said.
   
 "So that is why we're coming back now," Braun said. "This change in the intersection configuration will benefit and support future development along 45th Street, both east and west of Vine."
   
 Commissioner Mason Ruder asked whether similar plans are in the works for S. Vine as part of the planned S. Vine reconstruction.
   
 "We're pretty much keeping access freed up and as it is," Braun said. "We just have lower volumes of traffic down at that end of Vine, and don't really see the need to restrict the access."
