A Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang penalty was enough to give the Gunners a 1-0 victory, condemning United to their worst start to a home league season since 1972-73.
 The result also heaped more pressure on Solskjaer, with the Norwegian seemingly no closer to ending the Red Devils' wait for another title success than he was when he was handed a permanent three-year contract in March 2019.
 In stark contrast, Arteta has turned Arsenal into a formidable force again over the space of just 11 months, giving the team a clear identity while also delivering silverware in the form of the FA Cup.
 Wright thinks that United would be in a far better position if the Spaniard was sitting in the Old Trafford dugout instead of Solskjaer, who he believes is failing to get the best out of a squad brimming with talented players.
 "Can I just say something, I'm just going to blast it in: If Arteta is managing Man United they are challenging," the former Arsenal striker said on his _Wrighty's House podcast_.
 "Because, for me now I've got to the point where, when you look at the inconsistency of Man United with the components they have, the team that they have, what they should be doing.
 "We're talking about [Paul] Pogba here, World Cup winner, you've got [Axel] Tuanzebe who can't even get on the pitch after marking arguably two of the most exciting and brilliant players in the world.
 "He's using two holding midfielders when if he's playing Tuanzebe he doesn't need that! And you've got a manager who, for me, is playing off of vibes, he's managing off of pure vibes.
 "Look at what Arteta has done in his time at Arsenal. We're seeing coaching change, we're seeing coaching on the field, we're seeing impact. Look at [Mohamed] Elneny, came out of the blue, found him and said, 'He can do this for me, he can do that for me'. He's making the parts work.

There's also the problem of an endless array of bugs, some simply annoying and others requiring a level reset. I've been exploring and the camera decided I crossed just the right pixel to focus on a new scene, except Ray and company are still hanging out in the previous area which is now off-screen. That's easily fixed by taking a short walk back into the frame, but the time I hit two buttons in a level at the same time only to have one pallet fall instead of both required restarting the level from scratch. Enemies sometimes run away into walls forever, while the big goons forget to go into their taunt animation and instead attack and flex endlessly, effectively invulnerable until the game remembers that, right, it's been a minute or two so maybe it would be fair to let the player get a hit in. It gets tiring after a while, trying to let things slide, but there's enough good in Ray that it can be worth the effort.

This was what he sold to the tribal leaders. In exchange for the state support, leaders would get to rule undisturbed. This indirect rule would satisfy the stipulation of exercise of control, as per the Scramble for Africa's Berlin Treaty.

A lot of new followers here! ⁣ Quick recap! ⁣ ⁣ My name is Breanna and my husband here is Aaron! In the middle is my sweet mama who's 𝐜𝐚𝐫𝐫𝐲𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐟𝐢𝐫𝐬𝐭 𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐥𝐝 𝐚𝐬 𝐚 𝐠𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐜𝐚𝐫𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐫! ⁣ ⁣ We are over the moon excited, but it took a long hard road to get here. After many many years of infertility and loss, we had our doctor come to us and say that ultimately my uterus was incapable of growing a child. ⁣ ⁣ On our path to become parents, I had a few miscarriages, and one that required a D&C (procedure to remove pregnancy) and I developed a condition called Ashermans Syndrome. Ashermans Syndrome is where bands of scar tissue form inside your uterus. Most commonly from a D&C procedure. Google will tell you it's rare, but that's not true. It mostly goes undiagnosed. I had no idea this could happen prior to going in to the operating room that day, and I am still devastated by it. ⁣ ⁣ My mama came to me multiple times offering to carry for us. My response? I laughed. "you crazy!?" lol… I did not think that was even possible. My mom, Julie, is 51 years old and had already been through menopause! But she was persistent. One thing about my mom is when she sets her mind to something, she goes for it. She's a hardcore athlete, who's completed multiple Boston marathons and super into heath and fitness. She sets a goal and she goes for it. ⁣ ⁣ Since we already had been through IVF, and my husband and I had no issues creating embryos with my egg and his sperm. Half the work was done. Our embryos were frozen already waiting for us. Once our fertility doctor was on board, he prepared my moms body to carry, taking her out of menopause through hormone therapy, and the rest fell into place. ⁣ ⁣ Julie is 36 weeks with our baby girl! Her first grandchild! This has been the wildest ride of our lives. We are so grateful for my mom and that we were given this opportunity … I don't think there's ever been a morning I don't wake up and pinch myself. ⁣ ⁣ Thanks for joining us on this adventure! We love hearing how far this story has reached, comment below where you're from ♥⁣ ⁣ 📸: @oatsandhoneyphotography

Post from my mama!⁣ ⁣ I am now at 34 weeks and 5days gestation. They do everything in weeks and not in months, this took some getting used to because everything was in months when I was pregnant with my kids. 🤷🏼‍♀️ It is all different nowadays. So I start my 35th week on Thursday which is the last week in month 8th, so I am getting there. ⁣ ⁣ I go to the Doctors once a week now to be checked. I am having stress tests on baby to make sure she is all good in there, they check my urine to make sure everything looks good with the placenta and of course my blood pressure and check for any swelling. Everything so far has been spot on. Her growth scans have been right on target right up to 32 weeks, and at 32 weeks, she was developmentally a week ahead. We shall see how much more she has grown at my upcoming 36wk growth scan. ⁣ ⁣ For me, I have just been uncomfortable, up every 2 hours in the night. I had to go on an antacid for heartburn, obviously one that is safe for me to take while pregnant. Wow! that was a game changer for me felt so much better, otherwise I am doing great and hanging in there. ⁣ ⁣ I have to give a big shout out to my husband Rick. He has been working tons of hours at work and still keeping up with the house chores and outside of the house stuff. I am so appreciative of him he has been a big support person for me through all of this. He's invested in this just as much as I am but in different way. 💙⁣ ⁣ I still have no regrets in this whole process. Seeing my little girl happiness come back makes it all worth it. 💗

The Portuguese forward produced a delightful dinked finish to open the scoring at Stadio di Bergamo after being handed a rare start ahead of Firmino.
 He doubled his account when he took down a searching Joe Gomez pass before smashing home a half-volley, giving the visitors a 2-0 lead heading in at the break.
 A fine individual goal from Mohamed Salah put Liverpool 3-0 up two minutes into the second period, and Sadio Mane got himself on the scoresheet moments later when chipped the ball past Atalanta 'keeper Marco Sportiello after being played in by his Egyptian team-mate.
 Mane then turned provider himself as his delightful outside-of-the-foot pass found Jota bursting into the opposition half, with the 23-year-old then calmly rounding Sportiello before tapping into an empty net.
 A man who arrived at Anfield from Wolves for £45 million ($58m) on September 19 is now being tipped to replace Firmino as the Reds' first-choice central striker, but Barnes believes the Brazilian is still vital to Klopp's plans.
 The Liverpool legend expects Firmino to return to the fold when the reigning Premier League champions travel to the Etihad Stadium to face City on Sunday, as he told _talkSPORT_: “Jota scored a hat-trick, but that doesn’t mean he automatically goes into the team against Man City.
 “I think who plays depends on what the games are and who they’re against and how that team plays.
 “Against Man City, where you’re not going to have as much possession, maybe Firmino will be a better bet. You need a player like Bobby Firmino to not only get hold of the ball but also do his defensive work.
 “If you’re playing a game against Atalanta or Leeds, a more open team, then you can see Jota coming in.
 “It’s the same with Thiago. If you play Man City you won’t necessarily play Thiago, you play Wijnaldum, Henderson and Fabinho who are much stronger defensively.
 “I think Klopp will chop and change this season, and I don’t think it’s a reflection on who he feels is better, it’s more about who they are playing against.
 “Will Firmino’s lack of goals cost him? Well, the reason why Mane and Salah score as many goals as they do is because of the way Bobby plays.
