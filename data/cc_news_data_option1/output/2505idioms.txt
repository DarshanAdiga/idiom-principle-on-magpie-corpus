Size matters with full-size, light-duty trucks  
 For both interior and exterior measurements, I'm using the popular crew-cab, short-bed configurations of two-wheel-drive trucks across the board. (Note: For the Ram 1500, fields with duplicate numbers indicate the maximum available with the optional air suspension.)
 When it comes to exterior dimensions, the 2021 F-150 seems to split the difference nicely between the larger Ram 1500 and the Toyota Tundra, which is the shortest of the bunch. It's one of the narrowest in terms of width without mirrors, but remember, if you want to add towing mirrors, you'll add a whole lot of width. In the case of the F-150, the larger mirrors add a whopping 26 inches.
