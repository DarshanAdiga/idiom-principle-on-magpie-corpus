The American Dental Association “strongly encourages” dentists to disclose any fees to patients, saying the decision to charge the fee is an “individual dental practice business decision.”
 Regulators in Connecticut, Maryland and New York have received numerous consumer complaints about new fees at dentist offices. All three states have warned that state and federal laws do not allow in-network health providers to tack on new fees.
 “We’re seeing complaints of all types,” said William Tong, Connecticut’s attorney general. “All the arguments in favor of billing patients are not at all compelling to me.”
 Much like nursing homes, assisted living facilities have been pummeled by the pandemic. To protect residents and contain the virus' spread, they have bulked up their sanitation, increased staff pay and their testing, and invested in masks and other protective equipment.
 Occupancy levels are at a record low, according to Mark Parkinson, the chief executive of the American Health Care Association and National Center for Assisted Living, the largest industry trade group, representing about 4,000 centers. “Revenue is at record lows, and expenses are at record highs,” Parkinson said, adding that the industry, unlike other heath care sectors, received federal assistance only in September.
 Most residents at assisted living facilities pay out of pocket, since federal programs like Medicare typically don’t cover the stays. Unburdened by federal oversight or existing insurance contracts, assisted living facilities have wide latitude to charge residents a variety of fees. Some have raised rents, while others have charged residents to cover rising cleaning costs and masks.
 “There is a real desire to not have to pass on any of these costs,” Parkinson said.
 Still, in more than a dozen states, ombudsmen, who advocate on behalf of residents in long-term care facilities, said in interviews they worried such fees were only a fraction of what’s being tacked into bills and slipped into monthly rent statements. With nursing homes and assisted living facilities restricting visitors, there is less scrutiny of their practices. And some residents may assume that the cost is theirs to bear.
 Hambley, whose mother faced the $900 charge at her assisted living facility in Portage, Michigan, had a particular reason to be skeptical: He works in the industry, running a continuous care facility in another state.
 Some of the extra charges, including an $11 daily lunch fee, stood out, especially because his mother had been complaining about the quality of lunches since the start of the pandemic. “It seemed like this was an opportunity to take advantage of a population that is already vulnerable,” Hambley said. “They have no visits, no engagement. And on top of that they are scared.”

JERUSALEM (AP) — Facebook says it has taken down several fake accounts based in Iran that had voiced support for protests against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Facebook detailed several instances of “coordinated inauthentic behavior” around the globe, in which fake accounts were set up to interfere in the politics of other countries. It said the accounts have been removed from the social network. The announcement came in a monthly report released on Thursday. It said one such case involved 12 Facebook accounts, two pages and 307 Instagram accounts that had shared content in Hebrew and Arabic about protests in both Israel and Iraq. Facebook said the individuals behind the accounts had sought to shield their identities but that it was able to trace them to a Tehran-based IT company. It said the network of fake accounts had around 10,000 followers and was in the early stages of building an audience. Netanyahu and his supporters seized on the report, saying it proved that Iran supported the aims of his political opponents. The Black Flag movement, one of the main protest groups, accused the prime minister of incitement and called on supporters to attend its next weekly protest on Saturday. Israelis have been holding mass protests for months calling on Netanyahu to resign over his trial on multiple corruption charges and his government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic and the resulting economic crisis. Israel views Iran as its greatest threat because of Tehran's nuclear program, its support for regional militant groups and the incendiary rhetoric of its leaders. Israel said it thwarted a major cyberattack earlier this year targeting its water infrastructure, which was widely attributed to Iran. Israel is suspected of retaliating two weeks later...

Onscreen, supporters of Joe Biden expressed a mix of optimism and apprehension, while TikTokers backing President Donald Trump were largely confident, using their streams to boast about what they believed to be an inevitable victory.
 Nick Lowenberg, 18, a conservative influencer, said that the pro-Trump contingent on the app has been vocal leading up to Tuesday. “I think conservatives dominate the political side of TikTok,” he said, “but I think overall, TikTok users as a whole are definitely more left-leaning.”
 Shortly after midnight, Jax James, a 17-year-old TikTok star with 2.3 million followers, started a livestream titled “Scared.” On it, she held her head in her hands as she discussed the votes coming in. “Trump is probably going to win Texas,” she said as messages from her thousands of viewers flew across the screen.
 Behind the scenes, political TikTokers communicated in large group chats, trading information and deciding when to make their own calls on certain states.
 “I’m communicating with upwards of 70 people, all from political TikTok, about what’s going on,” said Ashleigh Hunniford, 17, of Colorado. “I’m relying on different sources that are online. I’m constantly checking Twitter for other people’s predictions and talking to other people about what they think is going to happen in real time.”
 Many were wary of jumping the gun before outcomes were fully known, and relied on the data-driven calls of traditional media. “The next few days are going to be hectic, and it is my responsibility and other big creators' responsibility to not mislead people into believing that the election has gone one way without having states or all the votes counted,” said Harry Sisson, 18, known online as @typical_democrat. “It’s incumbent on us to be accurate.”
 Aidan Kohn-Murphy, 16, a founder and lead organizer from TikTok for Biden, a group of more than 480 creators, planned an elaborate election night rollout for the account’s million followers. The account livestreamed throughout the night, updating the stream’s title with news like “lead in Arizona.” When The Associated Press called a state, TikTok stars in that state would create a custom video announcing the news, which was promoted on the @TikTokForBiden handle.
 That doesn’t mean creators weren’t treating Tuesday night as a big event. Mooneyhan, of the Libertarian Hype House, planned his election night stream outfit in advance. He donned a brown fur coat and gold circular glasses for the occasion. “It’s my drip outfit,” he said. “It’s what I wear when I want to be dripped out.” Many TikTokers wore campaign merch. Several male influencers streamed shirtless.
 “Compared to mainstream media, our livestream where we have people come in and interact is a much more fun and comfortable environment to consume election information,” Mooneyhan said.
 MemePAC, a youth-led, FEC-registered super PAC that opposes Trump, hosted a livestream on TikTok displaying a website created by Jackie Ni, 18, a founder of the group. The site pulled data from The New York Times election map and used an Among Us-style animation to eject Trump from the White House for every 10,000 popular votes that Joe Biden received.
 “I saw a lot of people were really stressed about the election, and I wanted to give them a way to see the results, but in a less stressful and more playful manner,” Ni said.
 Ashton Ray, 17, a TikTok star with 920,000 followers, said the app has proved to be a way for people not yet of voting age to participate in the political process. “Me and a lot of my fellow creators, the majority of us are under the voting age, but we have these large platforms,” he said. “We’ve been able to reach millions of young people.”

In Mount Prospect, which already has a medical cannabis dispensary, the village board last year rejected a zoning ordinance to allow recreational sales there. But trustees wanted to hear from residents on the issue, so they put the question on the ballot. Mayor Arlene Juracek said she wasn’t surprised by the result, considering residents also supported legalizing marijuana in a Cook County advisory referendum in March 2018.
 Juracek, who supports allowing sales, hopes to hold a public hearing to reconsider the issue before the end of the year.
 “Once it became legal statewide, the horse is out of the barn,” she said.
 As for the change in residents' attitudes, she said, “It’s different generations of voters. The northwest suburbs grew after World War II. Now, it’s baby boomers who came of age in the ’60s and ’70s, and younger. It’s just a basic social evolution.”
 While Western Springs has undergone some of the same changes, Village President Alice Gallagher said, it remained traditionally more conservative on the issue. Village trustees had raised concerns about where to put such a business and the potential damage caused by addiction. The village board held off on a decision until it could get residents' input.
 Unlike in other suburbs, where organized Opt Out groups fought retail sales last year, there was no organized effort to sway the vote either way in Western Springs, Gallagher said. She expected the board would likely follow the will of the people and ban sales soon.
 “This wasn’t close,” she said. “It seems pretty clear what the residents want.”
 Resident chose to go in the other direction in Wilmette. The North Shore village previously had imposed a moratorium on pot retail stores, but 55% of voters supported allowing sales.
 If the village board does so, it would have to decide on zoning issues such as in what part of the village to allow such a business, how many to allow, hours of operation and other factors.
 If approved, the tax revenues could help the village make up some of the projected $1.5 million shortfall in revenue projected due to COVID-19.
 Despite the referendum results, some local officials still had not committed one way or the other on the issue. In Elk Grove Village, 63% of voters supported allowing sales. But longtime Mayor Craig Johnson, who helped create the Elk Grove Village Cares addiction treatment program, was noncommittal, having seen the damage addiction can do to local youths.
 Johnson noted that neighboring towns with retail pot stores have not had any noticeable problems.

More than 46% of adult men in North Korea were smokers in 2017, according to the World Health Organization. But defectors from the country said that the percentage could be much higher, as men take to smoking in their teens as a source of entertainment in a place with few alternatives. North Korea claims that no women smoke.
 A common joke among North Korean men, according to defectors, is that it is possible to go “one day without eating, but no days without smoking.” Packs of cigarettes are used to bribe North Korean officials, they say.
 The lifelong smoker, Kim Jong Il, stopped smoking after a stroke, but was said to have resumed before he died, according to South Korean officials.
 His son, too, has found it hard to kick the habit.

NEW YORK (AP) — Weatherman and morning TV co-host Al Roker has revealed that he has been diagnosed with prostate cancer and will be undergoing surgery to have his prostate removed.“It’s a good news-bad news kind of thing,” Roker said Friday on NBC’s “Today.” “Good news is we caught it early. Not great news is that it’s a little aggressive, so I’m going to be taking some time off to take care of this.”Roker revealed he got the diagnosis Sept. 29. It began with a routine physical when his doctor discovered he had an elevated prostate-specific antigen in his bloodwork. That led to him getting an MRI, followed by a biopsy, to confirm his diagnosis.The 66-year-old TV personality urged others at risk — particularly Black men — to ensure they see a doctor and get the proper checkups to stop a cancer that is very treatable if detected early.“The problem for African Americans is that any number of reasons from genetics to access to health care, and so we want to make it available and let people know they got to get checked,” Roker said.Roker, a father of three, was by himself when he received the diagnosis. That made his wife, ABC News correspondent Deborah Roberts, upset. “I feel badly, because I didn’t tell Deborah to come with me,” he said. “In hindsight, boy I wish I’d told her to come.”Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

(The Conversation is an independent and nonprofit source of news, analysis and commentary from academic experts.) Bethany Teachman, University of Virginia (THE CONVERSATION) Well-meaning advice for people freaking out about current events often includes encouragement to be patient, stay calm and keep the faith… but how on Earth are you supposed to do that amid the insanity of 2020? As a practicing clinical psychologist and professor who studies how to manage anxiety and tolerate uncertainty, I offer 10 suggestions to make it through this highly stressful election period. 1. Put the phone down! While it is tempting to stay glued to your devices during this time, the never-ending doomscrolling and screen-refreshing becomes overwhelming and keeps you in a state of tension and constant vigilance. The excessive consumption of news and social media predicts poorer long-term mental health during times of crisis. Plan some breaks where you can engage in other activities that take your mind off politics and the uncertainties we face, and allow things to feel a little more normal for a while. 2. Uncertainty doesn’t equal catastrophe It’s hard not to know things – outcomes of elections, for instance. But not knowing shouldn’t mean that you assume the worst-case scenario has occurred. When you’re anxious (as many in the U.S. are right now), you tend to assign threatening meanings to ambiguous situations, but this tendency is neither accurate nor helpful. Jumping to catastrophic conclusions is like setting off a series of false alarms that keep you on edge and exaggerate your sense of threat. 3. Don’t retreat into bed The feeling of deep disappointment about election results you don’t like, or apprehension about upcoming results, can trigger a desire to withdraw...
