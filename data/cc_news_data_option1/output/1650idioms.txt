A significant portion of the Company's total product sales is dependent on housing starts and its business, financial condition and results of operations depends significantly on the level of housing and residential construction activity, which is expected to be negatively affected by the COVID-19 outbreak and pandemic. In the month of April, sales declined compared to March levels due to lower demand from the anticipated slowdown in housing starts and general construction activity. Declines in housing and residential construction, such as housing starts and home improvement projects, which generally occur during economic downturns, have in the past significantly reduced, and in the future can be expected to reduce, the demand for, and net sales, of the Company's products.

 News
 Diesel excise duties will fall from Friday, May 1, by €0.145 per liter, meaning that diesel fuel per liter may fall to as low as €1.054 from then.
 The government, as part of its raft of measures aimed at combating the coronavirus pandemic and its economic effects, recently opted to cut diesel fuel excise duty from €493 to €372 per 1,000 liters, bringing it in line with the level in Lithuania and closing a competitiveness gap between diesel fuel in Estonia and the other two Baltic States which often led to sales going outside the country.
 The move is expected to have a knock-on effect on other prices too. While the excise cut had been in the offing for some weeks, fuel retailers were keen to sell off existing stocks at their stations which had been purchased at the higher, previous excise duty rate.
 Raimo Vahtrik, sales director at Circle K Eesti, says his company has stocks in the fuel tanks hwhich ave been bought in with a higher excise duty rate, but nonetheless the filling station chain has decided to lower the excise duty rate from Friday, I.e to the new rate of €372 per 1,000 liters, or €0.145 per liter inclusive of VAT.
 The cut was not the only factor in at-pump prices, which Vahtrik could not say precisely what prices would be following the excise cut starting Friday.
 "As prices of motor fuels depend not only on excise duty, but also on the cost price of the product - both fossil and biofuel – as well as the competitive situation, we do not consider it possible today to assess their possible impact on Friday's retail price," Vahtrik said.
 Neste Estonia's retail manager Kristi Pari agreed it was not possible at the moment to say what the retail price of fuel will be at the gas station from May 1, because the final price depends on the movement of the purchase price in the coming days.
 Neste has, however, promised that, like other fuel sellers, it would pass on the price gain caused by the drop in excise duty to the consumer, ie lower the price of a liter of diesel fuel by €0.145 per liter from the beginning of the month.
 Last week, fuel prices fell in Riga and Vilnius, making diesel fule prices at pump, at €1.199 per liter, 30.5 cents pricier than in Riga and 32.4 cents more than in Vilnius.
 The cut does not affect gasoline prices, which in any case have been falling in recent weeks due to the global oil price slump.

Trudeau says the plan between the federal and provincial governments to start reopening the economy is a collaborative approach but the provinces have the right and the obligation to determine what is in their citizen's best interest. There is a set of guidelines and principles that have been agreed to that will help guide decision-makers and medical officers to decide how and when to reopen. Trudeau says some of those include making sure there are enough tracking and testing for COVID-19 available to protect against a surge in cases, as well as making sure there are specific guidelines for different sectors to reopen so it remains safe for workers. Trudeau says he has, “full confidence in the premiers to move forward.”

"Early on, we committed $350,000 to fund various non-profit agencies, throughout our footprint, who were impacted by the coronavirus.  Our employees also made the decision to cancel our company's 150th anniversary celebration activities and reallocate those funds to provide an additional $200,000 in support to those same charities.  I am proud to say that the WesBanco team, as of April 24, 2020, has deferred loan payments on more than 2,800 customer loans to help our customers make ends meet and to help support their families and businesses cash flow needs.  Our employees have also made more than 2,300 loans, totaling approximately $570 million, under the Small Business Administration's Paycheck Protection Program. We are fortunate to be in a strong position to provide support to others during this unprecedented time. Our thoughts are with essential service providers across all industries and with the many people and families suffering from this virus."

Rackspace started operations more than 20 years ago as a company that rented out infrastructure. In those days, if you wanted a co-located server at a hosting provider, you'd rent space on a rack in a data center. Hence: Rackspace.
 Today, Rackspace is a mostly cloud-centric IaaS provider. Their big claim to fame is the co-creation of the OpenStack open-source cloud computing platform, which runs IaaS loads (virtual servers and other resources) in public and private clouds. The key benefit of OpenStack, beyond its technically-sound cloud management features, is that it reduces lock-in. OpenStack implementations can (with effort) be ported from one OpenStack hosting provider to another.
 Rackspace provides a wide range of services and support on its cloud, mostly targeted to large SMB through enterprise.
