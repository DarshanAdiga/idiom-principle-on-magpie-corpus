Here at Brown, we have most recently seen these dynamics in our discussions about grading options in light of the recent changes and challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic. These discussions have demonstrated our commitment to the goals of equity and inclusion in University-level policy-making, especially among student activists who organized around the Universal Pass proposal. Yet these discussions have also demonstrated how little most of us know about how rules and regulations at Brown are actually made — and what voice we as students already have. If we want to make systemic changes at Brown, we should take this moment of crisis to learn more about how power is distributed at Brown and commit to an ongoing involvement in the decision- making process. As undergraduate representatives on the College Curriculum Council and University Resources Committee, we write in support of improvements to the Undergraduate Council of Students appointments process, commitments to transparency from the administration and, above all, more profound and sustained student engagement in faculty governance.

Former Australia batsman Mike Hussey has heaped praise on MS Dhoni, saying the veteran Indian wicketkeeper-batsman is the "greatest finisher" the game of cricket has ever seen.


  "Dhoni is the greatest finisher of all time that the cricketing world has ever produced," Hussey said while speaking to Sanjay Manjrekar on ESPNcricinfo's Videocast.


  "Dhoni can keep his cool and make the opposition captain blink first. Dhoni also has unbelievable power. He knows that when he needs to clear the ropes, he can do it. He has that kind of self-belief. Honestly, I didn't have that kind of belief in myself," he added.


  The former Australian batsman, who shared the dressing room with Dhoni for the Chennai Super Kings, said the 38-year-old Indian believes in the philosophy that he who panics last, wins the game.


  "I tried not to let it reach 12 or 13 runs an over," said Hussey while talking about his ability to finish the game without much hiccups.


  "And I learnt this from MS Dhoni. He is incredible. He believes that he who panics last wins the game. So Dhoni would keep his cool, and keep it longer because the pressure is on the bowler as well," he added.


  The 44-year-old believes that the greatest players of the game have a few common traits like "they don't hang on to a defeat for too long. If they lose, they move on quickly. They don't let a loss or a win hamper their thinking".


  "They are always consistent, and level headed whether it's MS Dhoni or Ricky Ponting."


  Hussey, who played 59 IPL matches for CSK, further revealed the secret about the franchise's success in the Indian Premier League.


  "Supportive owners who let coach Stephen Fleming and captain Dhoni decide how to run the team, excellent chemistry between the coach and the captain, Dhoni's leadership and lastly the foresight of the owners, Fleming and Dhoni to pick the best players, particularly the good Indian players and then stick with them for as long as possible."


  "This has built an excellent continuity in the team. And once you have continuity, you build relationships and trust that otherwise takes time to grow," he added.


  Hussey also said that once Dhoni bids adieu to the game, CSK would probably like to start all over again.


  "That's a 60-million-dollar question, and I am equally intrigued. I believe the owners would like to keep Dhoni involved in some way or the other," said Hussey.


  "However, whenever the change of guard happens, CSK might want to start all over again, build a brand, new team, and use their existing philosophy as they enter the next decade of IPL. It is definitely going to be more challenging in current times," he added.


  Dhoni was supposed to lead CSK in the 13th IPL edition which now stands postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Having been linked heavily to a host of Premier League clubs including Manchester United this week, superstar striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic turning up in England for a Champions League quarter-final and sauntering around as a deep-lying midfielder felt like a very Zlatan Ibrahimovic thing to do.


  However, this was not so much "daring to Zlatan" as needs-must for Laurent Blanc's Paris Saint-Germain, as they sought to prevail over Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium, with the tie delicately poised at 2-2.


  Blanc found himself without influential midfield duo Blaise Matuidi and Marco Verratti through suspension and injury and responded with an unexpected set up in Manchester.


  PSG deployed a back three for the first time this season and Ibrahimovic alternated between partnering Edinson Cavani up top and operating as a playmaker from much further back.


  The sureness of touch and range of passing in both positions, along with a thunderbolt free-kick that forced an excellent 16th-minute stop from Joe Hart, meant an expectant crowd were treated to glimpses of a thoroughbred footballer's full repertoire.


  With four Ligue 1 titles out of four during his time at the Parc des Princes, this was the mature, focused version of Ibrahimovic doing his part in pursuit of European football's ultimate prize before his anticipated close-season departure.


  He would sting Hart's palms with a second set-piece early in the second period - another high-class act that makes the 34-year-old's talk of post-Euro 2016 retirement appear little more than a joke with which to entertain himself.


  By that stage, Ibrahimovic was once again a conventional forward as Blanc's experiments yielded mixed results.


  After initially upsetting City's rhythm and quietening the crowd, PSG found their unfamiliar backline exposed - much to the liking of Sergio Aguero, Kevin De Bruyne and David Silva, City's scheming front trio.


  The visitors' defensive uncertainty reached breaking point when Serge Aurier coughed up possession to Aguero, who was felled by Kevin Trapp. But the Argentinian could only steer the resulting penalty past the PSG goalkeeper's left post.


  If this Champions League represented Ibrahimovic's last stand as PSG's totem, the same could be said for the established core of this City side.


  Aguero and Silva have been weaving attacking spells in tandem since the former joined from from Atletico Madrid in 2011.


  Hart, Yaya Toure and captain Vincent Kompany complete a quintet that have helped a club who won nothing between the 1976 League Cup and 2011 FA Cup go on to scoop every domestic honour in England.


  It was another evening of authoritative assurance from Hart, who also saved well from Thiago Silva and Cavani after half-time, but Toure was only fit enough for bench duty and Kompany failed in his bid to return from another calf injury.


  Of the outfield quartet, only Aguero is under 30 and a Pep Guardiola-led close-season overhaul is reportedly on the cards for a side who have fallen short so badly in the Premier League this term.


  But the new toast of east Manchester weighed in emphatically to ensure outgoing boss Manuel Pellegrini will have an historic semi-final chance to get the gang back together.


  De Bruyne's decision-making had not been at its sharpest until he icily surveyed the options and curled an unerring 25-yard shot past Trapp with 14 minutes to play.


  Blanc's patched-up side needed two goals. Their race was run - even when Ibrahimovic converted from an offside position late on. Slamming the ball into the turf while staring incredulously the linesman need not be his final act on an English pitch.


  They are fields that De Bruyne appears set to grace for a long time. Replaced by Toure as the clock ticked down, the Belgium international now appears to have taken the Ivorian's mantle of being the man City turn to when they need game-breaking inspiration.


  On Wednesday he delivered to the tune of the first Champions League semi- final in City's history.


  As Ibrahimovic prepares to depart the Paris stage, City look set to go into a new era with their very own force of nature.

  Meanwhile, you stare with a dazed look at the damage done to your portfolio as elucidated in your recent brokerage statement. Take heart, investment opportunities remain plentiful. What you need is a willingness to take decisive action with an overwhelming sense of self-assurance. Moreover, you must be able to stay the course despite the consternation of others.


   


  Having a predefined investment plan and not deviating makes navigating the ups and downs that naturally occur much easier to stomach. Keep in mind that volatility is part and parcel of Wall Street's DNA.


   


  Yes, there will be a variety of unpleasant announcements as we move through the upcoming earnings season, but, again, that goes with the territory.


   


  Nonetheless, a portfolio comprised of high-quality stocks in diversified sectors with a solid history of rising dividends will see you through the current economic and financial calamity with an embrace for greater returns going forward.


   


  One of my favorite company's -- and one that it might behoove you to do some research on -- is Lockheed Martin (LMT), one of the world's largest security, defense and advanced technology companies.


   


  Lockheed has achieved considerable success in recent years and continues to dominate in the field of advanced technology. During 2019, the company saw increased sales and operating earnings within all its business segments.


   


  Like so many others, Lockheed is suffering from the negative impact of the coronavirus. At the same time, the company's long-term prospects are worth considering.


   


  For example, escalating US-China geopolitical tensions will bolster Lockheed's defense and security divisions. Furthermore, Lockheed's revenues are primarily attributable to government contracts, which is desirable right now since Uncle Sam always seems to have funds to spend in that arena.


   


  Lockheed reported net sales of $59.8 billion in 2019, with 61% of that coming from the Defense Department. And given the growing threats abroad, the company's defense business will increase going forward.


   


  A key reason is the company's ability to provide some of the most advanced military technology available in the areas of Advanced Aeronautics, MFC (missiles and fire control), RMS (rotary and mission systems) and space technologies.


   


  The company's prodigious cash generation has resulted in a balance sheet levered at just 1.1 times at the end of 2019. Translated that means the company's net debt (gross debt minus cash) divided by 2019 EBITDA was 1.1x. That number is low, especially for the defense industry.


   


  To its credit, Lockheed has not frolicked in the areas of acquiring companies or participating in buying back its own shares. Put it all together and Lockheed can sustain an impaired business environment during 2020 better than most.


   


  In a world where guidance is suspended and where many companies cannot forecast future cash inflow, along with being highly levered means Lockheed is in an enviable position.


   


  Yes, there is always the risk of a reduced dividend to lower cash outflow. However, Lockheed said in its last earnings call some 50% of its shareholders are there primarily for the dividend. Therefore, Lockheed is likely to continue raise their dividend payout.


   


  Meanwhile, the intrinsic value of the shares, noting that first quarter's numbers will not be available until April 21, is $1,172 versus a recent share price of $442.53, with a 12-month forward dividend yield of 2.70%.

Nacional moved into the Copa Libertadores round of 16 after picking up a 2-2 draw at River Plate Montevideo on Thursday.


  River took the lead after just five minutes through Colombian Cesar Tajan but it did not take long for Nacional to respond at the Estadio Centenario in Montevideo.


  After Nacional won a free-kick in a dangerous position, defender Mauricio Victorino managed to slot the ball past the wall and goalkeeper Nicola Perez for the equaliser three minutes later.


  A goal from Kevin Ramirez put Nacional ahead in the 72nd minute, and, even despite Ignacio Gonzalez's own goal, a draw was enough to see the three-time Libertadores winners qualify past the group stage.


  However, the draw left River with no chance of making it into the last 16, while Rosario Central and Palmeiras will fight for the last spot in Group 2.

A look at the history of advisers, good and bad, is quite fascinating. Some famous advisers who were successful in helping their leaders achieve their aims, viz (1) Chanakhya was a master strategist and a shrewd politician who helped Chandragupta of the Maurya dynasty run his empire. His book “Arthashastra” is considered as the holy grail of Hindu politics and diplomacy (2) the Hindu adviser to Mughal Emperor Akbar, Birbal’s, wisdom was unparalleled, he was known for his wit and innovative solutions to many problems faced (3) As the Prime Minister to Wilhelm I of Prussia, and later the German Empire, Otto von Bismarck was instrumental in the unification of various German principalities into the German Empire and building its world- renowned bureaucracy and army. (4) Yelü Chucai was a trusted adviser to Genghis Khan who once ruled most of the known world. Chucai convinced the Mongols to tax conquered cities instead of destroying them as per usual practice, arguing that the money and manpower gained from the cities could fund future conquests. A common feature to good advisers is their loyalty to their sovereign, instead of being “prima donnas” their approach is ususally low-key and behind the scenes.

Vicente del Bosque is keeping his cards close to his chest as he entertains the idea of either Iker Casillas or David de Gea starting in goal for Spain at Euro 2016.


  Casillas has long been the undisputed number one for his country, captaining the side for their successful Euro 2008, World Cup 2010 and Euro 2012 campaigns.


  However, after disappointing at the last World Cup in Brazil, and with De Gea in fine form with Manchester United, Del Bosque has a decision to make.


  "They're both playing at the highest level", he told Radio Marca.


  "I have the utmost respect for Iker, but that's not to stop David, who is playing excellently at Manchester.


  "What is important is that we have two goalkeepers at the top level, either can play and we are sure he will do very well."


  In the last international break, De Gea started against Italy, while Casillas played at Romania, with the two seemingly neck and neck.


  "We wanted to play a game with each and that's what we did," Del Bosque said.


  "The most important thing is that everyone is willing to come, that no player comes reluctantly, but with the greatest enthusiasm to try to play in the team."


  Spain have friendlies against Bosnia-Herzegovina, South Korea and Georgia before kicking off their Euro 2016 campaign against Czech Republic on June 13.

  British Boxer Anthony Joshua has been challenged by a fresh opponent for the WBO Belt amid the ongoing break from professional boxing.


  Joshua had earlier been compelled to delay preparations for his scheduled face off with Bulgarian Kubrat Pulev, and have the big one against Tyson Fury later in the year, will have to consider the fresh challenge.


  The Challenger, Undefeated Frank Sanchez is said to be eyeing a chance to snatch one of Joshua's belt, Precisely WBO, having beaten Joey Dawejko on points last month to move up into the top ten of the WBO.


  The Brit could unify the division if he beats Pulev and get the better of the 33-year old Fury who pounced Deontay Wilder in February.

Angelino's return to Manchester City did not go to plan this season.


  The former academy prospect appeared to have been working towards the move, naming the best moment of his time with PSV was getting a call from his agent to tell him that his buyback clause was being exercised.


  However, that deal to beef up the left-back options on the cheap came to resemble the thinking that muddled City's summer transfer window and left them too short in crucial areas to be able to compete with an improved Liverpool side for the title.


  If Angelino's performances were not terrible, he was exposed in important games against Liverpool and Manchester United and there were no tears shed when it was announced that he had secured a deadline day move to RB Leipzig; a potential €30m fee in a year for a player not wanted at the Etihad sounded too good to believe.


  In less than two months, the 23-year-old has transformed opinion. He has slotted in effortlessly to a team that Julian Nagelsmann - a coach that sees the game as Pep Guardiola does and is in regular contact with him - demands a lot of and was part of the side that mercilessly ripped Tottenham apart over two legs to book a place in the Champions League quarter-finals.

After several months of turbulence, the diamond pipeline resumed normal operation at the end of 2019. The largest players, led by De Beers and ALROSA, reduced supplies (their annual sales in carats fell by 8% and 12% respectively) and restored the balance of supply and demand. The discipline of large diamond miners helped stabilize diamond prices in October, November and December and the midstream moved to a replenishment stage amid brisk Christmas sales, Petra Diamonds said in its report. In November, rough diamond imports to India grew by 32.4% in terms of value versus one year ago. “January saw steady demand for rough diamonds as cutters continued restocking on the back of positive Christmas jewellery retail sales,” ALROSA said following its January trading session, the result of which was 19% higher than the historical average for this month. Signet Jewelers, one of the largest jewelry retailers, increased its sales by 2% in North America during the festive season (nine weeks ending January 4) with online sales going up by 13.5%. Not only large US jewelry retailers showed strong results (accounting for 15-20% of the market), but they were also joined by small and medium-sized players, as it was noted in a review of VTB Capital.

Wildlife Take Advantage Of Fewer People Out And About : NPR

Millions of people around the globe have started working from home due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Among the frequent conversations over the internet on how to be productive in this situation, there are many trends being followed like setting up work hours and dressing up for work.Dipti Das, AVP - Design of home interiors brand HomeLane, suggests ways to create a well- designed and refreshing workspace using materials at home.Space selectionA dedicated work space at home can help in focussing on tasks at work for the day. The space selected should be quiet and away from household distractions. Convert any one of the available rooms into a workplace without disturbing the flow - all that is needed is a table and a chair.FurnitureThe desk should be at a height of 2'6"-2'8" for best comfort. Looking into a blank wall can be stressful. Hence placing the desk in front of a window is advisable. Mount a power strip underneath or on the back of the desk for multiple wires - laptop charger, mobile charger and other electronics required. Cable ties can be used to put together wires and hide them at the back of the furniture.Go for workstation chairs, preferably an adjustable one with a good lower back support. The ergonomic designs make sitting for long hours comfortable. In case the available space is small , one can opt for a space-saving foldable study table which folds away on to the wall when not in use.Make space on the desk for WFH essentials with trays to organize stationery and books. Make use of the vertical wall space with floating shelves to keep files that need easy accessibility.No place for workstation? In case of less square footage, repurpose the dining room table. However, it is not recommended to use a dining chair, as it is not designed for prolonged sitting sessions. Adding cushions can go a long way in providing the right support and softening the impact. Another alternative is to set up a makeshift arrangement by using a foldable laptop table that can be used while sitting on the bed.DecorAvoid making the workstation feel like an office cubicle by decorating it like any other room at home. Use fun notepads, sticky notes, a colourful basket for work trash and a quirky mug as a pencil holder. Hang inspirational prints or art on the walls. Indoor table plants like Echeveria and Peperomia can help break the monotony of work by giving you a taste of nature.LightingIt is essential to have sufficient lighting to avoid strain on the eyes and for a refreshing vibe. Natural light works best, but if that is not possible, then use a bright task light (white) to liven up the room or a study lamp on the desk for more lighting. Remember to position the computer monitor/laptop in a way that there is no glare on the screen from a window or overhead light.(This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

Some progressive leaders were positive but guarded in response to Sanders’ endorsement.


  “This endorsement shows that everyone wants to beat Trump,” said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Committee that originally supported Warren.


  “Our side will be increasingly energized the more it’s clear that progressive ideas and progressive leaders like Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and grassroots organizations have strong positions of influence with Biden,” Green said.


  But others remained skeptical. In  an interview with The Associated Press just a few hours before Sanders’ endorsement, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez criticized Biden’s overtures to progressives on health care.


  “We need a real plan and not just gestures,” said Ocasio-Cortez, a key Sanders surrogate during his campaign. “What I’d like to see at a bare minimum is a health care plan that helps extend health care to young people.”


  Trump’s campaign, meanwhile, seized on Sanders’ endorsement to underscore Biden’s embrace of some of his plans. In a statement, Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale said that “though Bernie Sanders won’t be on the ballot in November, his issues will be.”


  “Biden had to adopt most of Bernie’s agenda to be successful in the Democrat primaries,” Parscale said.


  Sanders could go a long way toward infusing Biden’s campaign with additional energy if he’s able to bring his enthusiastic following of millions of young and progressive voters along with him to support Biden. Young voters, a key Democratic voting bloc, have long supported Sanders over his former primary rivals by huge margins.

Crotone director Beppe Ursino has dismissed comparisons with Leicester City after his side secured promotion to Serie A on Friday.


  A 1-1 draw away to Modena was enough for the Calabrian club to seal a place in the top flight for the first time in their history.


  Thousands of fans packed the central square to watch the game on big screens and celebrated with fireworks at the final whistle, as Crotone - who have twice been bankrupted - ensured their remarkable success.


  Comparisons have been drawn with Premier League leaders Leicester, who can clinch a fairytale title win this weekend, but Ursino insists Crotone must be judged on their own merits.


  "I'm feeling intense, deep emotions," he told Calciomercato. "It is indescribable. In my view we have done something immensely important, it's a victory for all of Calabria.


  "Are we the Italian Leicester? No, we are Crotone and we each have our own identity. Our project has always been to rely on young players, to create a competitive team and try to keep costs down.


  "This year we managed to do something marvellous and the credit goes to the club, the coach, the players and our fans."


  Crotone are five points clear at the top of Serie B with three games left to play.

Tomemos en cuenta también que ni siquiera los sindicatos y menos el Ministerio de Trabajo disponen de estadísticas de cuantos despidos se han producido ya, cuantas suspensiones de sueldos aplican los empresarios a sus trabajadores con la justificación del confinamiento y la pandemia y sobretodo que el gobierno no decreta ni pide a la Asamblea Nacional garantizar los contratos, la estabilidad laboral y los salarios, al menos por el tiempo que dure el encierro, se debe entender que no hay tal unión ni solidaridad en el momento presente.

Kevin De Bruyne has no regrets over his decision to join Manchester City instead of Paris Saint-Germain.


  City face PSG at the Parc des Princes on Wednesday in their first Champions League quarter-final, with record signing De Bruyne back in action and back among the goals after two months on the sidelines with knee ligament damage.


  The Belgium international's sublime form with Wolfsburg last season made him one of the most sought after players in Europe and he plumped for a move to City in August despite also being in contact with PSG.


  De Bruyne's individual form has been superb under Manuel Pellegrini, with Saturday's comeback goal in the 4-0 win at AFC Bournemouth his 13th in 32 appearances to sit alongside 14 assists.


  But City have slumped to fourth in the Premier League, out of the title race following a dip in form that coincided with De Bruyne's absence, while PSG already have a fourth consecutive Ligue 1 title in the bag.


  "There were contacts with PSG. We have talked a bit, but afterwards I decided to join Manchester City, as they were a better option," De Bruyne told the Mirror.


  "I'm really happy that I've taken the right decision. My family are happy here, I'm happy. All goes well. It was a personal choice."


  The onus will be on the likes of De Bruyne, Sergio Aguero and David Silva to inflict first-leg damage on their opponents in Paris, but the 24-year-old knows a collective effort to stem a virtuoso PSG attack led by Zlatan Ibrahimovic will also be required.


  "As long as I can help the team, I'm happy," he said. "Everyone maybe has a different view because if you get a 0-0 it can also be good.


  "But if Paris score then it's good for us to score."

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bernie Sanders endorsed Joe Biden's presidential campaign on Monday, encouraging his progressive supporters to rally behind the presumptive Democratic nominee in an urgent bid to defeat President Donald Trump.


  "I am asking all Americans, I'm asking every Democrat, I'm asking every independent, I'm asking a lot of Republicans, to come together in this campaign to support your candidacy, which I endorse," the Vermont senator said in a virtual event with Biden.


  The backing came less than a week after Sanders ended his presidential campaign, which was centered around progressive policies such as universal health care. It's a crucial development for Biden, who must bridge the Democratic Party's entrenched ideological divides to put together a coalition that can beat Trump. Democratic disunity helped contribute to Hillary Clinton's loss to Trump in 2016.


  Perhaps eager to avoid a repeat of that bruising election year, Sanders offered his endorsement much earlier in the 2020 campaign. Sanders backed Clinton four years ago, but only after the end of a drawn-out nomination fight and a bitter dispute over the Democratic platform that extended to the summer convention.


  Biden and Sanders differed throughout the primary, particularly over whether a government-run system should replace private health insurance. Biden has resisted Sanders' "Medicare for All" plan and has pushed instead a public option that would operate alongside private coverage.


  Appearing in a split screen with Biden, Sanders said there's "no great secret out there that you and I have our differences."


  But Sanders said the greater priority for Democrats of all political persuasions should be defeating Trump.


  "We've got to make Trump a one-term president," he added. "I will do all that I can to make that happen."


  The coronavirus prevented Biden and Sanders from appearing together in person on Monday. But they made clear they would continue working together, announcing the formation of six "task forces" made up of representatives from both campaigns to work on policy agreements addressing health care, the economy, education, criminal justice, climate change and immigration.


  Biden, 77, has already made some overtures to progressives by embracing aspects of Sanders' and Sen. Elizabeth Warren's policies. The day after Sanders exited the race, Biden came out in support of lowering the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 60 while pledging to cancel student debt for many low- and middle-income borrowers. He's also previously embraced Warren's bankruptcy reform plan.


  Sanders, 78, is sure to remain a force throughout the campaign. When he ended his candidacy, he said he would keep his name on the ballot in states that have not yet voted in order to collect more delegates that could be used to influence the party's platform. He didn't say Monday whether he would continue to fight for those delegates.


  Still, Sanders and Biden emphasized their mutual respect for each other on Monday.


  Sanders referred to the former vice president as "Joe." Biden answered him repeatedly as "pal." The two men asked the other to give regards to their wives, Jill Biden and Jane Sanders.


  Biden told Sanders: "I really need you, not just to win the campaign but to govern."


  Even with Sanders' dozens of campaign stops for Clinton -- a record he brought up repeatedly to push back at the idea that he was partly to blame for her defeat -- Monday's conversation was something voters never saw between the 2016 rivals. Whether that translates to how Sanders' progressive base sees Biden is not yet clear.


  Some progressive leaders were positive but guarded in response to Sanders' endorsement.


  "This endorsement shows that everyone wants to beat Trump," said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Committee that originally supported Warren.


  "Our side will be increasingly energized the more it's clear that progressive ideas and progressive leaders like Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and grassroots organizations have strong positions of influence with Biden," Green said.


  But others remained skeptical. The divisions in the party were clear Monday when, in an interview with The Associated Press just a few hours before Sanders' endorsement, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez criticized Biden's overtures to progressives on health care.


  "We need a real plan and not just gestures," she said. "What I'd like to see at a bare minimum is a health care plan that helps extend health care to young people."


  Trump's campaign, meanwhile, seized on Sanders' endorsement to underscore Biden's embrace of some of his plans, with campaign manager Brad Parscale saying in a statement that "though Bernie Sanders won't be on the ballot in November, his issues will be."


  "Biden had to adopt most of Bernie's agenda to be successful in the Democrat primaries. One thing that is missing is enthusiasm, however, as almost no one is excited about a Biden candidacy," he said.


  But Sanders could go a long way toward infusing Biden's campaign with additional energy if he's able to bring his enthusiastic following of millions of young and progressive voters along with him to support Biden. Young voters, a key Democratic voting bloc, have long supported Sanders over his former primary rivals by huge margins.


  Biden and Sanders on Monday emphasized the need to address the challenges confronting young people during the pandemic, with Sanders describing "a generation of young people who are experiencing crisis after crisis."

Guus Hiddink admits some of his Chelsea stars have begun to take it easy as their attention turns to the upcoming European Championship.


  Defending champions Chelsea suffered back-to-back Premier League defeats after slumping to a 3-0 home loss against Manchester City on Saturday.


  It was their 16th reverse in all competitions during what has been an abysmal campaign, with Chelsea languishing in 10th and still six points shy of their worst Premier League points tally of 50.


  Hiddink believes with the season coming to the end and no realistic target to aim for, some of the Chelsea players have begun preserving themselves for the Euros in France.


  "Partly true, but I cannot blame the players for having a lack of attitude," the Dutchman said on the matter.


  "Some players might think that, but I cannot look into their minds, in their brains. They might be thinking of the Euros.


  "When there is nothing at stake then with some people there is a little bit of a lack of the ultimate work."


  Despite being out of it Chelsea still have a big say in the title race for this season with home games against Tottenham and leaders Leicester City to come.

Il destino che ebbe Hiroshima è ben noto a tutti. Ma fu proprio dopo l’esplosione della bomba atomica che emerse lo spirito Mukainada, dal nome della zona dove sorgeva e si trova ancora il quartier generale di Mazda. L’edificio infatti, grazie alla protezione di un monte, rimase integro per buona parte offrendo un punto di riferimento per i sopravvissuti e, allo stesso tempo, diventò il simbolo della tenacia e della voglia di reagire anche dopo le difficoltà più grandi. La ripresa avvenne di nuovo con il Mazda-Go e due altri motocarri a 3 ruote: il Romper e il K360. La svolta ci fu nel 1960 con la R360, una kei-car con motore posteriore bicilindrico a V di 356 cc da 16 cv.

The Asian Football Confederation announced Tuesday the indefinite postponement because of the coronavirus of all matches scheduled for May and June, plunging the AFC Champions League into further disarray.


  The region's premier club competition was put on hold in March as the pandemic spread, and the latest reshuffle means the 32-team group stage will have to be completed in July before the already-postponed knock-out rounds start a month later.


  "Following the continued preventive measures and travel restrictions put in place by several governments, the Asian Football Confederation has decided today to postpone all matches and competitions scheduled to take place in May and June until further notice," an AFC statement said.


  "As one of the first confederations in world football to undertake precautionary measures in light of the COVID-19 outbreak, the latest decision reinforces the AFC's commitment to ensure the safety and wellbeing of players, participating teams, officials, fans and all stakeholders."


  Less than two of the six rounds of group-stage matches have been completed so far, meaning the competition will face severe congestion even if it returns in July.


  The extended shutdown also affects the two-legged women's Olympic qualifying play-off between China and South Korea, which had already been moved to June 1 and 9.


  June qualifiers for the men's 2022 World Cup and 2023 Asian Cup had already been postponed.


  Football was one of the first sports affected by travel restrictions prompted by the coronavirus, which has now forced the blanket stoppage of professional sporting events worldwide.

It's far from the first time King Vajiralongkorn has attracted controversy in Thailand, where it is banned from criticising the royal family, or even their pets.
 However, he is such a divisive figure that the royal is still criticised in his home country, albeit in private due to the threat of 35 years in prison.
 As the oldest monarch to ascend to Thailand's throne, King Vajiralongkorn, has been married four times and has a colourful private life.
 Said to be worth £24billion the royal has hit the headlines for all the wrong reasons, from his marriages, to his mistresses and even a leaked video of the queen naked apart from a G-string.

As soon as we met him, we fell head over heels in love and knew then and there that we were prepared to do anything asked of us to be able to adopt him! We visited the Centre 35 times and Porkie visited our house with his Canine Carers. Dogs Trust implemented the ‘Porkie Plan’ to get him accustomed to life in a home and together, we worked on his excitability. What a change there has been in his behaviour! We were thrilled to be able to take him home last month and now he enjoys nothing more than snuggling with myself and my husband on the sofa. He’s a completely different dog to the one we met back in October and we couldn’t be prouder of him and everything he has overcome; we simply adore him!”

The Asian Football Confederation announced Tuesday the indefinite postponement because of the coronavirus of all matches scheduled for May and June, plunging the AFC Champions League into further disarray.The region's premier club competition was put on hold in March as the pandemic spread, and the latest reshuffle means the 32-team group stage will have to be completed in July before the already-postponed knock-out rounds start a month later."Following the continued preventive measures and travel restrictions put in place by several governments, the Asian Football Confederation has decided today to postpone all matches and competitions scheduled to take place in May and June until further notice," an AFC statement said."As one of the first confederations in world football to undertake precautionary measures in light of the COVID-19 outbreak, the latest decision reinforces the AFC's commitment to ensure the safety and wellbeing of players, participating teams, officials, fans and all stakeholders."Less than two of the six rounds of group-stage matches have been completed so far, meaning the competition will face severe congestion even if it returns in July.The extended shutdown also affects the two-legged women's Olympic qualifying play-off between China and South Korea, which had already been moved to June 1 and 9. June qualifiers for the men's 2022 World Cup and 2023 Asian Cup had already been postponed.Football was one of the first sports affected by travel restrictions prompted by the coronavirus, which has now forced the blanket stoppage of professional sporting events worldwide.

  The coronavirus prevented Biden and Sanders from appearing together in person. But they made clear they would continue working together, announcing the formation of six “task forces” made up of representatives from both campaigns to work on policy agreements addressing health care, the economy, education, criminal justice, climate change and immigration.


  Biden, 77, has already made some overtures to progressives by embracing aspects of Sanders’ and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s policies. The day after Sanders exited the race, Biden came out in support of lowering the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 60 while pledging to cancel student debt for many low- and middle-income borrowers. He’s also previously embraced Warren’s bankruptcy reform plan.


  Sanders, 78, is sure to remain a force throughout the campaign. When he ended his candidacy, he said he would keep his name on the ballot in states that have not yet voted in order to collect more delegates that could be used to influence the party’s platform. He didn’t say Monday whether he would continue to fight for those delegates.


  Still, Sanders and Biden emphasized their mutual respect for each other.


  Sanders referred to the former vice president as “Joe.” Biden answered him repeatedly as “pal.” The two men asked the other to give regards to their wives, Jill Biden and Jane Sanders.


  Biden told Sanders: “I really need you, not just to win the campaign but to govern.”


  While Sanders campaigned for Clinton dozens of times after the 2016 primary, the rapport on display with Biden on Monday was far lighter than anything voters saw four years ago.

 A celebration of the life of Lee Edlefsen, 82, of St. Anthony is in the works. Born in Lyman Dec. 28, 1937, he died April 10, 2020, at his home of natural causes. He lived a full life. He grew up on a farm in the Lyman area south of Rexburg, the youngest son of Edlef Clark and Mildred Bybee Edlefsen. It was a fine childhood spent riding horses, fishing and hunting around the neighborhood when he wasn't taking care of his chores. He learned many skills from his parents that he used throughout his life, such as horsemanship, carpentry, cooking and canning everything from pickles to chokecherry syrup. He attended a three-room elementary school in Lyman and graduated in 1956 from Madison High School in Rexburg, serving as student body president playing on the football team. He graduated from Utah State University in Logan, Utah. He worked as a social studies and industrial arts teacher and had a long career as a social worker, retiring in 2003. He married Carolee Rudd in 1960. They later divorced. He married Joyce Driggs in 1987. He had many talents and interests. His bread-making was famous in the family, as was his woodworking. He made toy boxes and other projects for family and friends, and furniture for his home and dabbled in painting, wood burning and leather working. He was known for his tolerance of his wife's frequent advice. He loved hunting, especially for elk, and especially with his son, Alan, who remembers his dad looked forward to an elk hunting adventure as the biggest event of the year. At camp, he loved nature and whatever lay around the next corner. He loved the anticipation that accompanied the breaking of the dawn, from the Selway to the high desert. A game of cards, a retold, retold, retold hunting story and a good laugh brought him pure joy. For years his freezer was full of venison and elk meat. He always loved to fish, and he always found some time to take a kid fishing. He enjoyed the cornucopia of television, and his daughter Erin remembers watching late night old time shows like Ma and Pa Kettle on the weekends together. He spent many summers working for Teton Trail Rides at Jenny Lake guiding tourists on horseback trips into the Tetons. He told lots of stories about his experiences there and made lifelong friendships with co-workers. He was a prolific reader and devoured dozens of novels each winter. In the summer he enjoyed golfing on a men's league. He loved traveling, and he and his wife visited the Oregon Coast and ventured afar to Paris, Nova Scotia, Canada, Alaska and the Great Smoky Mountains. He loved Yellowstone Park. He enjoyed gardening and grew beautiful roses and tasty tomatoes. He's survived by his wife, Joyce; children, Alan (Sherry) Edlefsen of Victor, Erin (Khris) Edlefsen of Puyallup, Wash.; stepchildren Sally (Aaron) Myler of Driggs and Suzanna (Pratap) Murali of Meridian; 14 grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. He was preceded in death by his parents, a brother and a sister.

Ambition begins with understanding the aspirations you have for yourself and your team. These aspirations are often expressed in the form of goals that define your desired outcomes. Knowing how far to reach for any given aspiration is key to harnessing healthy ambition. Setting goals that require just the right level of difficulty and discomfort helps ensure you push yourself and your team to reach beyond your current abilities. If the challenge is too great, you risk giving up or becoming discouraged when you fall short. If the challenge isn’t great enough, you risk becoming bored or never realizing the full potential of your efforts.

Bayern Munich will have to wait another week to win the Bundesliga title despite beating Hertha Berlin 2-0 on Saturday.


  The league leaders eased to a relatively straightforward win at the Olympiastadion on Saturday.


  Arturo Vidal broke the deadlock in the 48th minute with a deflected strike before Douglas Costa made sure of the points 11 minutes from time with a stunning strike, cutting inside from the right and firing into the top-left corner.


  But it was not enough to clinch the title for another year as second-placed Borussia Dortmund maintained a seven-point gap to the defending champions, winning 3-0 away at struggling Stuttgart.


  Shinji Kagawa converted Henrikh Mkhitaryan's cross to open the scoring in the 21st minute and 17-year-old Christian Pulisic netted his second goal in three games just before half-time.


  The result was effectively made safe by Mkhitaryan after 55 minutes but Dortmund's title challenge will come to an end should Bayern beat Borussia Monchengladbach at home next weekend.


  Hannover avoided their relegation being confirmed by coming from behind to draw 2-2 at 10-man Ingolstadt.


  Alfredo Morales put Ingolstadt ahead 10 minutes in but the hosts were dealt a blow when defender Romain Bregerie was sent off in the 20th minute for a foul on Felix Klaus.


  The 10 men went 2-0 to the good through Moritz Hartmann five minutes later but Hiroki Sakai and Hiroshi Kiyotake rescued a point for Hannover in the second half, although Daniel Stendel's men are all but down, nine points adrift of the relegation play-off place with three games left.


  Bayer Leverkusen capitalised on Hertha's slip-up to tighten their grip on third place, coming from behind to dent Schalke's Champions League push with a 3-2 win at the Veltins Arena.


  Schalke's Klaas-Han Huntelaar saw a fifth-minute penalty saved after Leroy Sane had been fouled by Omer Toprak.


  But Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting and Sane hit home to give Schalke a 2-0 lead inside 30 minutes. However, two goals in the space of three minutes in the second half from Julian Brandt and Karim Bellarabi restored parity.


  And Javier Hernandez completed the comeback just short of the hour mark, scoring his 17th goal in 27 Bundesliga matches with a fine finish across the face of goal.


  Elsewhere, Augsburg moved five points clear of the relegation play-off place with a 2-0 success at Wolfsburg and Anthony Modeste and Marcel Risse each scored doubles as Cologne thumped Darmstadt 4-1.

Demand for newspapers has also declined, with many readers avoiding newspapers and housing societies banning the entry of vendors as precautionary measures while some magazines have temporarily suspended editions. With little scope of a recoup, the report expects newsprint demand to decline in FY21. Demand for tissue papers has risen in the wake of increased hygiene concerns, leading to a 6.6 per cent monthly growth in the wholesale price index of tissue paper. However, the subsequent closure of eateries in March is likely to have a negative impact in the first quarter. Warning of more pains for domestic paper manufacturers from imports, which account for 15-20 per cent of domestic demand and grew around 18 per cent till January of FY2020, the report says Chinese companies are likely to push the unsold inventory to the country, despite the fall in the rupee. This coupled with a subdued demand environment and high stocks in the supply chain would weigh on paper prices for most of the grades. All this will have pulp prices subdued in the near-term. Many Chinese producers have announced plans to cut production in April.

Stocks fell on Wall Street Monday, erasing some of the market's big gains from last week, as investors braced for a sobering first look at how the coronavirus pandemic has hurt company earnings.


  The S&P; 500 fell 1% after cutting its early losses by more than half toward the end of the day. The benchmark index surged 12% last week, its best gain since 1974.


  The pullback followed news over the weekend that OPEC, Russia and other oil producing nations have agreed to cut output in a bid to stem a slide in crude prices following a collapse in demand due to the outbreak.


  Financial, industrial and health care stocks took some of the heaviest selling. Amazon and a few other retailers were bright spots. Traders continued to watch for more signs that the coronavirus outbreak may be leveling off and what that could mean for the prospects of reopening the economy.


  Cautious optimism that the outbreak has begun to plateau in some of the worst-hit areas and another big infusion of economic support by the Federal Reserve helped spur last week's big rally. This week, stocks could be in for more volatility as companies report results for the first quarter, though analysts will be focused primarily on what management teams have to say about what the rest of the year looks like.


  Details may be hard to come by, as many companies have ceased giving earnings forecasts because of the uncertainty over when government officials will determine it's safe to roll back the social distancing and stay-at-home mandates that have all but ground the economy to a halt.


  "The companies don't know what demand is going to be over the next three months or over the next six months," said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird.


  The S&P; lost 28.19 points to 2,761.63. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 328.60 points, or 1.4%, to 23,390.77. The index had been down 624 points. The Nasdaq reversed an early slide and rose 38.85 points, or 0.5%, to 8,192.42. The Russell 2000 index of smaller company stocks lost 34.68 points, or 2.8%, to 1,212.04.


  European markets were closed for a holiday, and Asian markets ended mostly lower.


  Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury to 0.75% from 0.72% late Thursday. U.S. markets were closed last Friday for the Good Friday holiday.


  Several major banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Bank of America, and big companies, including UnitedHealth Group, Johnson & Johnson and Rite Aid, are on deck to report results this week.


  Analysts predict that earnings for all the companies in the S&P; 500 will be down 9% in the first quarter from a year earlier, according to FactSet. That would be the biggest annual decline in earnings for the index since the third quarter of 2009 when earnings slumped nearly 16%.


  "Our view is its one big write-off year," said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at SunTrust Advisory Services. "The market is going to start thinking more about 2021, 2022. On the other side of this, what does that business look like?"


  The closure of businesses and mandates for people to stay home have forced a record number of Americans out of work and raised the possibility that many businesses could end up bankrupt. That has many investors anticipating what may be the worst recession since the Great Depression.


  Investors have been focused on the trajectory of the coronavirus for clues as to how pronounced the economic fallout will be. Despite some positive signs — the death toll in New York on Sunday dipped below 700 for the first time in a week — the overall data indicate that the number of new cases continues to increase.


  There are more than 1.86 million confirmed cases worldwide, led by the United States with more than 557,000, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.


  Traders are trying to gauge when shutdowns in many countries might ease. Comments by Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top infectious disease expert in the U.S., have raised hopes. He has said some parts of the U.S. might be able to reopen as early as next month, while warning that much remains uncertain.


  China has begun, cautiously, to reopen activity in regions such as Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province that were shut down during the worst of its outbreak.


  After last week's big move up, stocks are likely moving into a trading range reflecting a tug of war between investors' hopes for a recovery and concerns about the extent of the damage to the economy. Quick actions by the Fed and the $2 trillion economic aid package from the government have eased some of investors' concerns.


  That optimism helped push the S&P; 500 up 6.9% so far this month, though it's still down 18.4% from the record high it reached Feb. 19.


  Oil prices got a brief boost following the decision by OPEC and other oil producers over the weekend to cut production by nearly 10 million barrels a day, or a tenth of global supply, beginning May 1.


  Analysts said the cuts were not enough to make up for the void in demand due to business and travel shutdowns due to the coronavirus. But the deal at least helped resolve a price war that took U.S. crude to near $20 per barrel, pummeling U.S. oil and gas producers.


  U.S. benchmark crude initially jumped more than $1 but then lost ground. It fell 35 cents to settle at $22.41 a barrel. It declined $2.33, or 9.3%, to $22.76 a barrel on Thursday, before the Good Friday holiday.


  Brent, the international standard, rose 26 cents to close at $31.74 a barrel on Monday.

  Stocks moved higher recently as the coronavirus pandemic showed signs of peaking in multiple regions. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo noted that his state could be approaching the apex. Specifically, that deaths related to the pandemic have been flat in New York, while the number of daily hospitalizations and patients in intensive-care units has declined.


  Wall Street also embraced a positive note from JPMorgan Chase CEO James Dimon, who wrote in his annual letter to shareholders that America can emerge from the coronavirus \"stronger.\"


  Meanwhile, you stare with a dazed look at the damage done to your portfolio as elucidated in your recent brokerage statement. Take heart, investment opportunities remain plentiful. What you need is a willingness to take decisive action with an overwhelming sense of self-assurance. Moreover, you must be able to stay the course despite the consternation of others.


  Having a predefined investment plan and not deviating makes navigating the ups and downs that naturally occur much easier to stomach. Keep in mind that volatility is part and parcel of Wall Street's DNA.


  Yes, there will be a variety of unpleasant announcements as we move through the upcoming earnings season, but, again, that goes with the territory.


  Nonetheless, a portfolio comprised of high-quality stocks in diversified sectors with a solid history of rising dividends will see you through the current economic and financial calamity with an embrace for greater returns going forward.


  One of my favorite company's -- and one that it might behoove you to do some research on -- is Lockheed Martin (LMT), one of the world's largest security, defense and advanced technology companies.


  Lockheed has achieved considerable success in recent years and continues to dominate in the field of advanced technology. During 2019, the company saw increased sales and operating earnings within all its business segments.


  Like so many others, Lockheed is suffering from the negative impact of the coronavirus. At the same time, the company's long-term prospects are worth considering.


  For example, escalating US-China geopolitical tensions will bolster Lockheed's defense and security divisions. Furthermore, Lockheed's revenues are primarily attributable to government contracts, which is desirable right now since Uncle Sam always seems to have funds to spend in that arena.


  Lockheed reported net sales of $59.8 billion in 2019, with 61% of that coming from the Defense Department. And given the growing threats abroad, the company's defense business will increase going forward.


  A key reason is the company's ability to provide some of the most advanced military technology available in the areas of Advanced Aeronautics, MFC (missiles and fire control), RMS (rotary and mission systems) and space technologies.


  The company's prodigious cash generation has resulted in a balance sheet levered at just 1.1 times at the end of 2019. Translated that means the company's net debt (gross debt minus cash) divided by 2019 EBITDA was 1.1x. That number is low, especially for the defense industry.


  To its credit, Lockheed has not frolicked in the areas of acquiring companies or participating in buying back its own shares. Put it all together and Lockheed can sustain an impaired business environment during 2020 better than most.


  In a world where guidance is suspended and where many companies cannot forecast future cash inflow, along with being highly levered means Lockheed is in an enviable position.


  Yes, there is always the risk of a reduced dividend to lower cash outflow. However, Lockheed said in its last earnings call some 50% of its shareholders are there primarily for the dividend. Therefore, Lockheed is likely to continue raise their dividend payout.


  Meanwhile, the intrinsic value of the shares, noting that first quarter's numbers will not be available until April 21, is $1,172 versus a recent share price of $442.53, with a 12-month forward dividend yield of 2.70%.

So is it back to business or backtracking on covid-19? What role does widespread testing play for restarting the economy? Earlier today I spoke to ABC news contributor and former homeland security adviser to president trump Tom Bossert. And ABC chief medical correspondent Dr. Jen Ashton. Thanks to both for join us. Jen, let me start with you. It's been more than a month since president trump said anyone who wants a Fess can get a test. Yet we keep hearing widespread complaints from sick people who are still unable to get tested or are waiting days for results. Why is it so important for nationwide consistent testing to be quick? So many reasons, juju. First, we need to get rapid results, meaning within five or 15 minutes so, we can go through the basic first steps with an infectious disease outbreak. We need to be able to detect, diagnose, isolate, and treat people who test positive. We also know based on new data that's just come out of Iceland where because they have such a small country they're testing basically anyone who wants to get tested. That now as high as 50%, half of people who test positive, may show no symptoms at all. So we also need to be able to test a lot of people in order to track silent transmission and know where this virus is. That has a lot of implications. Tom, the U.S. Lost weeks of precious time getting testing up and running compared to other countries like Germany and south Korea, which allowed them to contact trace. What lessons can we learn from those other countries and how do we make up for that lost time? I think the biggest lesson there is we don't want to repeat the same mistake twice. We have to come up with a plan that allows us to use those tests on people that may be symptomatic but don't feel really that bad. So the idea of changing the standard, to Dr. Jen's point of who gets the test, will help us improvise to make unfor the scarcity of tests we're seeing and this competing need to get back to work. And Jen week, seeing a number of major studies being launched on antibody testing in the U.S. Does the presence of antibodies mean you're definitely immune, and how long might that immunity last? Because there are now some reports that people are test positive twice. Exactly. And we have to remember, this virus is barely four months old, so we're still learning a lot about it in real time. And we're extrapolating a lot based on what we know from other coronaviruses. So in general, those antibodies when we're exposed to an infection tell us kind of three -- a few more categories of people. It tells us who's susceptible, who may be actively infected. You sometimes can tell that with antibody tests. And who has recovered. But what we don't know with this particular virus is when those antibodies show up, how long they last, and how powerful they are or even if they convey any degree of immune protection against that virus down the road. Tom, beyond testing for the virus the fda has approved a company to roll out antibody tests, and we know how crucial that is, to see if people have been exposed to covid. But how crucial is knowing antibody status as a road map for getting back to business? We won't have perfect knowledge, but we're going to have to make decisions. We can't wait for that perfect knowledge. That's kind of the mistake we made the first time. So to Dr. Jen's point, we're taking the lessons of history, we're assuming with a high degree of credibility and a lot of doctors that have studied this, that people that have been exposed and who have recovered are going to have some degree of immunity. Tom, everyone is understandably wanting to get back to business. Governors are saying they're forming regional alliances to discuss how and when to do that. Even Dr. Fauci has talked about a rolling re-entry, which could start as early as next month, saying these immunity cards, proving you've already had covid might have been able to get us up and running. How realistic is that, given how unreliable our testing has been? Yeah, I think the first thing to focus on there, though, is that there's regional formations of groups and there's a rolling set of conditions. One of the things the president has said is he needs to change his messaging on is he's going to make some big decision as if it's a binary light switch that's either on or off. We're going to see people come back in different regions based on different conditions. So the answer to your question, then, chases based on where you are and what the test results are in your region and what those conditions of risk acceptability and risk -- willingness to take risk your leaders might have. And I think the medical science community right now and Dr. Jen and others are working on, this are trying to put out those conditions. That would be reasonable risks for us all to take. Tom, you talk about regional differences and Dr. Jen, I'd be curious for your thoughts. President trump suggested that widespread testing isn't necessary. If you go to Iowa, quote, Nebraska, there are big differences, lots of land, you don't need testing there. Well, we don't know. And we don't know until we start testing. And we have to be able to prioritize care and resources based on those testing results. And sometimes the more rural locations are actually those with the highest-risk medical they have less access to medical care. They live farther away from testing or treatment facilities. And so right now we're not at the point yet where we can just use the map of the United States to dictate who gets tested and when. Dr. Jen Ashton, Tom Bossert, thank you both so much for your insights. Thanks, juju. Thank you.

"If a country gives you the license to do something with certain restrictions, you have two choices," Bloomberg told his staff. "You either accept the license and do it that way, or you don't do business there."


  Bloomberg said the newsroom should be proud of its coverage of China. He also said there were a few "bad apples" at any large institution. Some journalists at Bloomberg News took that to be aimed at the China team. Through a corporate spokesman, Bloomberg LP and its founder, the former mayor, declined to comment for this story.


  The following month, Bloomberg LP Board Chairman Peter Grauer told the Asia Society's Hong Kong chapter that the company had roughly 50 journalists in China primarily to write about the local business and economic environment there. "Every once in a while, we wander a little bit away from that and write stories that we probably ... should have rethought," he said.


  In late 2013, Bloomberg News suspended Mike Forsythe, accusing him of leaking word of the controversy to other news outlets. The company would later fire him. He soon landed at _The New York Times_.


  Forsythe declined to comment for this story. In leaving the company, he signed a nondisclosure agreement that bars him from speaking publicly about his time at Bloomberg News. Others from the China investigative team would leave the company in the years that followed, each having first signed an agreement not to disparage the company. In at least one case, a journalist signed the non-disparagement deal in part to prevent the loss of a month's pay.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Prisoner rights advocates accused the federal Bureau of Prisons of "slow walking" the release of inmates at a Louisiana lockup where the coronavirus has killed six prisoners and infected dozens of others.


  The American Civil Liberties Union urged a federal judge on Monday to release hundreds of vulnerable inmates at FCC Oakdale to home confinement, calling the rural facility a tinderbox "ready to explode."


  Jail officials deemed several dozen prisoners "potentially eligible" for release. But the ACLU described the government's plan as "far too little, far too late."


  As of Sunday night, 38 inmates and 17 staff members had tested positive for COVID-19 at the Louisiana prison. There have been six deaths there since March 21.


  "The prison has apparently succeeded in releasing no one except to hospitals and mortuaries," the nonprofit argued in new court filings.


  The Bureau of Prisons did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It previously has said its case managers are "urgently reviewing all inmates to determine which ones" are eligible for home confinement.


  Attorney General William Barr ordered the Bureau of Prisons earlier this month to increase the use of home confinement and expedite the release of eligible high-risk inmates, beginning at three prisons identified as coronavirus hot spots, including Oakdale.


  "We have to move with dispatch in using home confinement, where appropriate, to move vulnerable inmates out of these institutions," Barr said in the April 3 memo to the prison system's director.


  The ACLU filed a lawsuit seeking class-action status last week, saying conditions at Oakdale violated inmates' Eighth Amendment protection from cruel and unusual punishment. More than 1,800 prisoners are housed at the prison compound nearly 200 miles (320 kilometers) from New Orleans.


  Congressional leaders and prison advocates have been pressing the Justice Department for weeks to release at-risk inmates ahead of a potential outbreak, arguing that the public health guidance to stay 6 feet (1.8 meters) away from other people is nearly impossible behind bars.


  The Bureau of Prisons said last week that it had increased the use of home confinement by over 40% since March. The agency said an additional 566 inmates had been placed in home confinement since Barr first issued a directive to increase its use in late March.


  But the ACLU has criticized the Bureau of Prisons as moving too slowly, identifying fewer than 70 prisoners for potential release.


  "The Bureau of Prisons' plan to review less than 100 of the men currently incarcerated at Oakdale is dangerous and immoral," said Somil Trivedi, a senior staff attorney at the ACLU's Criminal Law Reform Project.


  "It does nothing to achieve social distancing, which public health experts agree is crucial for containing the outbreak," Trivedi added. "Men are sleeping three, four, five to a cell, less than 6 feet away, and many are reporting that cellmates are coughing through the night."


  The ACLU is not alone in sounding the alarm about the outbreak at Oakdale. Both of Louisiana's Republican senators, John Kennedy and Bill Cassidy, and Rep. Mike Johnson, R-La., wrote a letter last week urging Bureau of Prisons Director Michael Carvajal to take "immediate action," and suggesting the pandemic caught the bureau off guard.


  Carvajal defended his agency's handling of the crisis over the weekend. "I don't think anybody was ready for this COVID," he told CNN, "so we're dealing with it just as well as anybody else, and I'd be proud to say we're doing pretty good."


  At Oakdale, one of the hardest-hit federal prisons in the country, the Bureau of Prisons said it has taken "numerous steps to mitigate the spread of COVID-19," including by isolating symptomatic inmates and quarantining those exposed to positive cases.


  Prison officials said in a court filing that inmates who are exhibiting symptoms are placed in a special isolation unit, where they are tested for the virus and held alone in cells. Other inmates who have been exposed to someone who tested positive are held in quarantine, officials said.


  Inmate orderlies "have been deployed on a 24-hour basis to disinfect" the jail, cleaning telephones and computers after each use.


  "All inmates are also being monitored by medical staff daily, including temperature checks," Assistant U.S. Attorney Karen King wrote in a court filing.

Liverpool held Borussia Dortmund to a 1-1 draw in the first leg of the Europa League quarter-final as Jurgen Klopp made an emotional return to Signal Iduna Park.
 Klopp guided Dortmund to back-to-back Bundesliga titles during an acclaimed seven-year spell in charge, but there was no sign of mixed emotions when he reacted with typical exuberance to Divock Origi's first-half opener.
 Belgium international Origi was preferred to Daniel Sturridge in attack but he lacked the composure to add a second away goal on the stroke of half-time.
 It was a miss the away side would regret as Dortmund captain Mats Hummels, back in Thomas Tuchel's line-up following a calf injury, headed a 48th-minute equaliser.
 Dortmund stormed past Liverpool's Premier League counterparts Tottenham in the previous round but struggled for similar fluency as Klopp employed the relentless pressing tactics he made his trademark on this ground, leaving the tie delicately poised for when the sides meet at Anfield next week.
 Both sets of fans joined in a stirring rendition of "You'll Never Walk Alone" before kick-off and there was a nervous moment for Simon Mignolet when the action got underway, the Liverpool goalkeeper dangerously cutting back across Pierre Emerick-Aubameyang when the Dortmund forward tried to charge down Mamadou Sakho's backpass.
 Sakho was in the right place to block Henrikh Mkhitaryan's close-range effort in the 18th minute, before his centre-back partner Dejan Lovren headed James Milner's free-kick too close to Roman Weidenfeller and clattered into the Dortmund keeper in pursuit of the rebound.
 That brought a lengthy delay, with Weidenfeller's bloodied mouth necessitating a change of jersey, after which Dortmund put their visitors under increasing pressure – only to fall behind in the 36th minute.
 Milner leapt to flick on Alberto Moreno's hopeful chipped pass and Origi powered on to the loose ball before seeing a low right-footed shot clip Lukasz Piszczek's heel and nestle in the bottom-left corner.
 Lovren made a vital challenge to deny Aubameyang in first-half stoppage time and Marco Reus was unable to convert when Liverpool failed to clear the resulting corner.
 Origi should have doubled his tally with the final act of the half, as Moreno picked apart a Dortmund offside trap in disarray.
 But his first touch took him too close to the embattled Weidenfeller, whose objections to the striker's follow-up challenge earned him a yellow card.
 An apparent recurrence of his persistent heel pain ended Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson's evening at half-time, with Joe Allen introduced, while former Liverpool loanee Nuri Sahin replaced Erik Durm in the Dortmund midfield.
 The hosts' equaliser came within three minutes of the restart when Hummels was allowed a free run at Mkhitaryan's right-wing cross to power a header past Mignolet.
 Liverpool responded by forcing a succession of saves from Weidenfeller, who was superbly down to his right corner to keep out a powerful Philippe Coutinho strike before thwarting the Brazilian again on the rebound from Nathaniel Clyne's long-range drive.
 The intensity of the match dropped, somewhat inevitably, during the final half hour and Dortmund could not craft the opportunity for a winner, as Liverpool displayed a level of defensive discipline rarely associated with their performances this season to take a draw back to Merseyside.

Manchester City might be in unfamiliar territory ahead of a maiden Champions League semi-final appearance but Savio has warned former club Real Madrid they face a tough task in their bid to advance to the showpiece decider.


  City will host 10-time European champions Madrid in the first leg of the final-four tie on April 26, following Friday's semi-final draw.


  Manuel Pellegrini's City made it through to the semi-finals of the competition for the first time in their history after upstaging French champions Paris Saint-Germain in the last eight.


  Madrid, in contrast, are preparing for a sixth successive Champions League semi-final, however Savio told Omnisport that will count for nothing if they do not improve on their showing against Wolfsburg, which required a Cristiano Ronaldo hat-trick to overturn a two-goal deficit.


  "Man City is a great surprise. They delivered an impressive performance against PSG. They were brilliant in the two legs," the 42-year-old Brazilian said.


  "They are going to be a tough opponent. Madrid had a terrible match in Germany but they could change things with the power of Santiago Bernabeu and some superb talent from the squad."


  Awaiting the winner in the final at San Siro in Milan on May 28 will be either Atletico Madrid or Bayern Munich.


  Atletico stunned title-holders Barcelona in the quarter-finals, while Bayern overcame Benfica.


  Savio, who played alongside Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane at the Santiago Bernabeu between 2001-2003, added: "Everyone thought that Barcelona were the favourites. It was the same on PSG-Man City. PSG were more solid defending and attacking and then we saw the final result.


  "I think that it's hard to predict anything but City can definitely make it. Their midfield is very strong now with Fernando and Fernandinho. Fernandinho is having a great season, especially in Champions League.


  "City also have individual talents. David Silva is so important for the club. [Kevin] De Bruyne is just fantastic and [Sergio] Aguero can make the difference.


  "So I strongly believe that City can reach the final and Madrid have to be cautious."


  The clash at Manchester's Etihad Stadium in just under a fortnight will see former Manchester United star Ronaldo return to the city, while team-mate and ex-Tottenham attacker Gareth Bale is also set to touch down on English soil again.


  Savio, though, insists the duo do not need any extra motivation as Madrid bid to win an 11th European crown.


  "It's a Champions League match so that's enough," he said. "They both were brilliant in England. Cristiano for Man United and Bale with Spurs achieved a lot.


  "They are now vital for Madrid and obviously coming back to where they were so happy is something special. But playing a Champions League semi-final, fighting for the 11th title, is motivation enough."

Meanwhile, the government has cancelled a provisional order for a machine developed by a group including the Renault and Red Bull Formula One teams.
 The Cabinet Office will reportedly not be going ahead with the purchase of the BlueSky model because of clinician concerns it is not suitable for treating coronavirus patients.
 The recent emergence of coronavirus means healthcare professionals are still learning how best to treat the disease.
 Recent NHS data suggested that two thirds of coronavirus patients in the UK who need to be hooked up to a ventilator will die.
 A report from the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre found ventilated patients succumb to the virus 66.3 per cent of the time.
 That is double the mortality rate of non-virus patients who were put on breathing support between 2017 and 2019 before the outbreak.
 Volunteers working at the new NHS Nightingale super-hospital in London were told that 80 per cent of patients on ventilators could die.
 A government spokesman said developing a new ventilator 'from scratch usually takes years' and that in the four weeks since the Ventilator Challenge started 'we have made rapid progress'.
 The spokesman said the new designs were still being tested by clinicians to make sure they meet the 'necessary standards for patient safety and effectiveness of treatment'.
 The Prime Minister's Official Spokesman said yesterday that the NHS still has spare ventilators and is below its capacity as the UK approaches the peak of the outbreak.
 He said: 'There are now over 10,000 mechanical ventilators available to NHS patients.
 'There has been an increase of around 200 over the past week and there are another 2,000 mechanical ventilators on order plus thousands of provisional orders for industry designed ventilators which are going through testing.
 'The key point here is obviously that the NHS continues to have spare capacity in terms of beds in intensive care units and ventilators and that anybody who needs intensive care treatment or a ventilator has access to it.'

Borussia Dortmund closed the gap on Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich to seven points with a comfortable 3-0 win against 10-man Hamburg, their bogey club, at Signal Iduna Park on Sunday.
 The first two goals came within a six-minute period at the end of the first half, with Christian Pulisic scoring the opener by rounding off a training ground set-piece routine to give Dortmund the lead after what had been a sloppy start.
 The hosts doubled their advantage when Adrian Ramos scored a terrific solo goal to give his side complete control and they were barely troubled from that point on.
 Hamburg's chances of a comeback were dealt a huge blow shortly after the interval when goalkeeper Rene Adler was dismissed for bringing down Shinji Kagawa outside the box.
 Dortmund's victory – which lifts the mood after their shock Europa League collapse at Liverpool on Thursday – was then sealed when Ramos tapped in his second in the closing stages.
 Thomas Tuchel's men had beaten Hamburg just once in their last seven meetings, but the routine win means Bruno Labbadia's visitors - who have lost four of their last five games - are in danger of being sucked into the relegation spots. They remain just three points clear of Werder Bremen in the play-off position.
 Teenagers Pulisic and Felix Passlack were handed starts as Tuchel made seven changes with an eye on Wednesday's DFB-Pokal semi-final against Hertha Berlin.      Nicolai Muller had an early effort from which Roman Burki made an easy save, before Kagawa saw his penalty appeal rejected after going down in the box.      Muller went close again with a 25-yard drive and Ivo Ilicevic headed wide as Hamburg started the game well on top.      Substitute Sven Schipplock, on for the injured Pierre-Michel Lasogga, was presented with a fine chance after Sven Bender's mistake but the striker delayed his shot and Mats Hummels got back superbly to snuff out the danger.      That wasted opportunity proved immediately decisive as Dortmund took the lead in the 38th minute, Pulisic scoring his first Bundesliga goal with a delightful finish.      A well-worked corner was flicked on to Pulisic by Hummels and the 17-year-old took a touch to get the ball out of his feet before planting a low shot into Adler's bottom-right corner.      The hosts' lead was doubled six minutes later, Ramos latching on to a Nuri Sahin ball over the top, cutting inside off the left and bending an unstoppable finish across Adler.
 Passlack could have had a penalty in the first minute after the interval, but referee Marco Fritz again decided against awarding Dortmund a spot-kick.
 Hamburg's hopes of mounting a fightback were severely dented after 50 minutes when Adler clattered Kagawa just outside the box and was harshly sent off by Fritz despite multiple defenders racing back to cover.
 Dortmund had failed to beat Hamburg since hammering them 6-2 at Signal Iduna Park in September 2013 and Ramos could have added a third, but a heavy touch let him down as Adler's replacement Jaroslav Drobny narrowed the angle well.
 But Hamburg had to play the last 10 minutes with nine men after Albin Ekdal suffered an injury and was unable to continue, with Ramos tucking in Dortmund's third with four minutes to go after Drobny's save from Kagawa's shot had fallen into his path.

Everton dug themselves out of the deepest of holes on the final day of the 1993-94 season, beating Wimbledon from 2-0 down. Andy Schooler makes it his greatest game. Everton 3-2 Wimbledon Premier League, 1993-94 It is tough, very tough, to define greatness, particularly in terms of what makes a great football match. Rarity would be a quality many would mention and not many games have begun with one team's kit smelling of smoke but that was the case in this one for Wimbledon, whose bus had been set on fire overnight, allegedly by Everton fans. Apparently though, smoky kit doesn't immediately qualify a game for greatness. The good news is this one had plenty of other key factors which have left it burned on the brains of those who witnessed it. For me, such key factors include an element of surprise and a piece of individual brilliance. If these can be delivered on a stage which really matters, all the better. This game ticked all three of those boxes. Out of their hands It is probably worth addressing the latter first to give the game its context. Everton, the club with more top-flight seasons under their belt than any other, headed into it in the final relegation place, knowing even a win might not be enough for them to survive. They were praying at least one of Southampton, Sheffield United and Ipswich would slip up. In the end, all three did but for much of the game at Goodison, it didn't look like that would matter. Wimbledon, who went into the match having won seven and drawn two of their last nine, quickly established a two- goal lead to leave the fans on three sides of the famous Grand Old Lady - like many top-flight grounds of the time the other stand was being rebuilt - almost literally silent. It was a good Wimbledon team, make no mistake. The club will forever be remembered for their 1988 FA Cup success but this was the Dons' Premiership (as it was then) peak. With a side featuring Vinnie Jones and Robbie Earle in midfield and John Scales - who would be back on Merseyside signing for Liverpool a few months later - in defence, they were about to equal their best-ever finish of sixth. Digging the hole Another of the team's stars, Dean Holdsworth, put them ahead from the penalty spot early on after an inexplicable handball by Anders Limpar. It was his 24th goal of the season. The lead was soon doubled as Andy Clarke fired off a hopeful shot which was heading well wide until Gary Ablett got in the way to divert it into his own net. Everton, champions just seven years prior, had their head almost through the trapdoor. The worm turns However, having seen everything go against them, the stars were about to align in spectacular fashion. They grabbed a lifeline when Limpar (pictured below) tumbled under a challenge from the brilliantly- named Peter Fear. Had VAR been available, the penalty award would probably have been overturned and who knows where Everton would be now? As it was, the spot kick stood and Graham Stuart, whose only previous penalty in his career had been missed, confidently slotted home in front of the Park End building site. Everton should still have been dead and buried before the real drama began - Holdsworth missing two good headed chances before the break and then seeing an effort bundled off the line with what looked suspiciously like Stuart's hand after the interval. Bolt from the Blue Like so many great games, there was a sense that something special was brewing and so it proved. Midway through the second half, Barry Horne won a challenge in midfield and took the ball, somewhat awkwardly, in his stride. He nudged it forward off his thigh before letting fly with his right foot. With the ball not fully under control it was exactly the sort of effort which could have been sliced away towards the corner flag. As it was, Horne struck it perfectly. To use golf parlance, it was not a slice, more of a fade, the ball bending into the top corner from more than 30 yards out. The definition of unstoppable. 2-2. Mission accomplished It was the game's most memorable moment but the one which lifted its status to greatness was still to come. It arrived with nine minutes to go, Stuart exchanging passes with Tony Cottee and striking a low shot past Hans Segers. Cue delirium. Segers' poor dive received much attention. Indeed a few years later it formed evidence against him in a corruption trial from which he was acquitted. What was known is he had no chance with either of the other two goals and it was hard not to say that Everton had saved themselves in remarkable fashion. Had the winner not come, the Blues would have gone down. Instead, it was Sheffield United who made the drop, conceding in injury time to lose 3-2 at Chelsea - a goal which saved Ipswich. A frankly ramshackle team had delivered from a position of utter peril when it mattered most, in the process making this a truly great game.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Donald Trump asserted Monday that he is the ultimate decision-maker for determining how and when to reopen the coronavirus-stricken country, though it is unclear what authority he has to overrule the states.


  While Trump, who is anxious to put the crisis behind him, has issued federal social distancing recommendations, it has been governors and local leaders who have instituted mandatory restrictions, including shuttering schools and ordering the closure of non-essential businesses.


  The White House did not immediately respond to questions about what authority they believe the president might have to overrule local orders. Under the Constitution, public health and safety is primarily the domain of state and local officials. And many of those leaders have expressed concern that Trump's plan to try to return to normal as soon as the end of the month will cost lives and extend the duration of the outbreak.


  Though he abandoned his once-held goal of rolling back regulations by Easter Sunday, Trump has been itching to reopen a battered economy that has plummeted as businesses have shuttered, leaving millions of people out of work and struggling to obtain basic commodities.


  Taking to Twitter on Monday, Trump said some are "saying that it is the Governors decision to open up the states, not that of the President of the United States & the Federal Government. Let it be fully understood that this is incorrect...it is the decision of the President, and for many good reasons."


  He added, "With that being said, the Administration and I are working closely with the Governors, and this will continue. A decision by me, in conjunction with the Governors and input from others, will be made shortly!"


  Trump last month put in place nationwide recommendations that most Americans stay home and distant from one another in order to slow the spread of the virus. But his guidelines, scheduled to expire at the end of the month, have little force -- unlike actions of governors and local leaders that carry fines or other other penalties, and in some jurisdictions extend out into the early summer.


  Trump's claim that he could force governors to reopen their states also represents a drastic shift in tone. For weeks now, Trump has argued that states, not the federal government, should lead the response to the crisis. And he has refused to publicly pressure states to enact stay-at-home restrictions, citing his belief in local control of government.


  Some states, like Ohio and Washington state, took more aggressive action to shut down than the White House initially suggested. Others, like Florida, have waited and resisted the strictest orders.


  Talk on how and when to reboot the nation's economy has come as Trump has bristled at criticism that he was slow to respond to the virus  and that lives could have been saved had social distancing recommendations been put in place sooner.


  Comments by the nation's top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, particularly seemed to draw the president's ire.


  When asked Sunday on CNN if acting earlier on social distancing and "stay at home" policies could have saved lives, Fauci said was "very difficult to go back and say that," but added: "I mean, obviously, you could logically say that if you had a process that was ongoing and you started mitigation earlier, you could have saved lives. Obviously, no one is going to deny that. But what goes into those kinds of decisions is complicated."


  Trump reposted a tweet that referenced Fauci's comments and included the line, "Time to #FireFauci," raising alarms that Trump might consider trying to boot the nation's top infectious diseases expert.


  But a senior administration official said Trump was not considering firing Fauci, and was merely reacting to what he perceived to be criticism of his leadership. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal discussions.


  "This media chatter is ridiculous - President Trump is not firing Dr. Fauci," White House spokesman Hogan Gidley later said in a statement, insisting it was Democrats and the media who ignored the virus, not Trump.


  "Dr. Fauci has been and remains a trusted advisor to President Trump," he said.


  Fauci, 79, a career official, has emerged as one of the most recognizable and trusted faces of the federal government's response.


  Meanwhile, federal officials were working on expanding the availability of testing -- including tests that could show whether someone has antibodies for the virus, indicating they've recovered and may be immune -- as a necessary step toward easing the social distancing guidelines.


  On a conference call Monday with governors, Vice President Mike Pence and Dr. Deborah Birx, the coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, raised concerns about untapped testing capacity, encouraging hospitals and lab facilities to coordinate to improve the efficiency of testing.


  Birx said that on one platform, providers had the supplies to run 3 million tests over the last three weeks, but have only run 200,000.


  Pence also said an announcement would be made later this week on expected approval for antibody tests.


  Trump has promised to unveil a task force of White House, state and local officials, business executives, economists and health officials Tuesday as he explores how to reopen businesses without reversing progress.


  Fauci has talked about the possibility of "rolling reentry" for certain parts of the country as early as next month, provided health authorities can quickly identify and isolate people who will inevitably be infected. But he said he "can't guarantee" that it will be safe for Americans to vote in person on Election Day, Nov. 3.


  Fauci cautioned that whenever restrictions ease, "we know that there will be people who will be getting infected. I mean, that is just reality. "


  And he warned that, "There is always the possibility, as we get into next fall, and the beginning of early winter, that we could see a rebound."

In corso ci sono anche scelte che riguardano la tua vita personale e che in un certo qual modo coinvolgono pure il partner.

TOKYO (AP) — There is no “Plan B” for the Olympics if they need to be postponed again because of the coronavirus pandemic, Tokyo organizers said Tuesday.


  Masa Takaya, the spokesman for the Tokyo Olympics, said organizers are proceeding under the assumption the Olympics will open on July 23, 2021. The Paralympics follow on Aug. 24.

Aston Villa caretaker manager Eric Black hopes his team's efforts in the 3-2 defeat at Watford can help to mend relations with the club's fanbase.
 Relegated Villa led twice at Vicarage Road through Ciaran Clark and Jordan Ayew but Aly Cissokho's red card for a professional foul on Ikechi Anya turned the tide and a late brace from Troy Deeney helped to ease the pressure of Watford boss Quique Sanchez Flores.
 A mutinous atmosphere has surrounded Villa home games in recent weeks but Black felt a sizable travelling contingent will have been encouraged by their display in an 11th consecutive league loss – matching the worst run in club history dating back to 1962-63.
 "The players have been criticised, and justifiably so, but not today," he told a post-match news conference. "Ultimately of course you need to win games but there was a lot to be encouraged by.
 "It's a fantastic football club with fantastic supporters and maybe it's just one little step towards getting the supporters back on side.
 "I thought the effort of the players was outstanding, they showed desire and hunger but the sending-off changes the whole context of the game.
 "At 2-1 up, I thought we looked like the team who were going to score again. The key moment is the sending off."
 Black sympathised with Cissokho's efforts to win the ball but ultimately had no complaints over the Frenchman receiving his marching orders.
 "I think Aly makes contact with the ball but, in doing that, I think his momentum takes his leg up," Black added.
 "I can see why the referee has interpreted it the way he did."
