So here we are. Scott County is known as a rural community where people go the extra mile to help each other out — because of kindness, because of charity, because it's a tight-knit community. It's a reputation that dates back to when our Relay For Life in Scott County raised more money for cancer research, per capita, than any other county in East Tennessee. It's a reputation that has been honed over the years by our willingness to reach out through our churches, through our non-profits, and lift up those among us who are less fortunate. Collectively, we make sure that nobody among us has to go hungry, that nobody among us has to go cold, that nobody among us has to go homeless.

I'm a firm believer that life shouldn't stop because of coronavirus. We should still be able to go places we enjoy going, our kids should still be able to go to school, and we should still be able to watch our kids play ball. That's freedom. That's liberty. But with freedom comes personal responsibility. And there are certain precautions we could easily take that we aren't taking. Because we're failing, we risk losing it all: going places, school, ballgames … and our vulnerable loved ones.

PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — Maine's Saddleback Mountain is reopening to skiing in the middle of a pandemic, but General Manager Andy Shepard sees a silver lining because many people who have been cooped up for months have a hankering to get outdoors The mountain reopened Tuesday after a five-year hiatus with an overhauled lodge, a new chairlift and changes aimed at keeping skiers safe in a pandemic. “If you’re going to be in business, your mantra better be, ‘There are no problems. There are only opportunities.’ This is the perfect example of that,” he said. The ski mountain that overlooks Rangeley Lake, about 110 miles (180 kilometers) from Portland, closed before the 2015-16 winter season despite what longtime skier Lizzy Reinholt described as a loyal following that appreciated the mountain's laid-back vibe, down-to- earth people, plentiful snow and old-school New England trails. “Because it's always been family owned and hasn’t been so commercial, people forget you skiing on one of the biggest mountains in Maine,” Reinholt said. It's been a long, rocky road to reopening. A local foundation tried unsuccessfully to reach a deal with the Berry family that owned the ski area. Then an Australian businessman promised to transform the ski area into a four-season resort. It never happened. Boston-based investor group Arctaris Impact Fund became interested around 2018, and wrapped up its financing package last January. Skiers were disappointed that the mountain didn't open last winter but the delay provided time to make improvements and adapt to COVID-19, Shepard said. Over the summer, the resort replaced an outdated, double chairlift with a faster detachable quad lift that tripled skier capacity, reducing lift lines and getting skiers to the mountaintop faster....

In a paper published in _Scientific Reports_ in November 2020, the team details how they utilized a small heating apparatus that accepted fullerene and heated it to a temperature of 1,173 Kelvin for about an hour. The fullerene originally deposited in the heating apparatus de-crystallizes due to the heat and subsequently re-crystallizes as the temperature is lowered. This overall process, known as annealing, is over fifty times faster than the older technique for producing fullerene crystals.

The narrowing range in the USD/JPY, start to finish last week was less than 10 points, and even the high and low registered just 75 points, evinces the market's indecision. The pair has continued lower since the first week of November on momentum rather than from any conviction. USD/JPY is weak because its recent history has been weak not because there is logic to the cause, according to FXStreet's Analyst Joseph Trevisani. Key quotes "There is no dollar advantage yet to be eliminated but there is no replacement for the trend so it continues aided perhaps, by the minor yield advantage Japan's deflationary prices give to domestic interest rates. It is reinforced by the market's regular adherence to the descending channel which dates to July 1 and provides structure." "The stasis of the last two weeks has a downward drift but it is due largely to the absence of conviction not to its presence. The more numerous and better-traded resistance lines and the descending channel help to keep bias down though without exerting much pressure. Support at 103.70 and 103.30 is robust."

COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — South Carolina's public school districts are getting more than $84 million in federal aid to help get facilities reopened amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, officials announced this week, as some of the state's largest districts shut off in-person learning due to rising case numbers. According to the Department of Education, the funding from the Coronavirus Relief Fund may be used for safety measures and personal protective equipment, hiring of school nurses, hiring of staff to provide one- on-one instruction and support services for struggling students, and technology equipment to support online learning. The funding is beginning to be allocated this week, officials said. “Our teachers, nurses, and school staff have gone above and beyond to support students throughout the COVID-19 pandemic,” Superintendent of Education Molly Spearman said in a statement. “These funds are to be used to maintain and support their efforts to welcome additional students back safely for face to face instruction and meet the needs of those that are struggling both online and in the classroom.” The money is in addition to more than $194 million in CARES Act funds that have already been allocated to South Carolina school districts, state Education Department officials said. A growing number of the state's school districts that had been operating a hybrid of in-person and online learning have announced plans to move students back out of the classroom, even as Gov. Henry McMaster has insisted schools maintain in-person learning options five days a week. On Monday, Richland One and Two, two large districts in the Columbia area, announced they would revert to all-virtual classes for at least the first two weeks of January, citing the rising number of COVID-19...

KAILUA-KONA, Hawaii (AP) — A Hawaii woman has been sentenced to serve at least two decades in prison for killing a 6-year-old boy in a case that revealed a pattern of abuse that the judge characterized as torture. Ashley Nihipal was sentenced to the maximum term of 20 years for causing the death of Mazen Kaniela Nihipali-Moniz at a Big Island apartment complex on Halloween in 2018 while she was caring for the boy, West Hawaii Today reported Sunday. Nihipal pleaded guilty in September to manslaughter and three counts of felony abuse of a family or household member in the presence of minor under age 14. Kona Circuit Court Judge Robert Kim sentenced Nihipal Friday. In addition to the manslaughter term, Kim sentenced her to consecutive terms of five years for the three abuse charges, calling the death a “horrible case of abuse and torture.” “I am giving you the maximum because it is what you deserve,” Kim said during the sentencing hearing. Authorities said Nihipali- Moniz was choked by Nihipal after his school reported to her that the boy removed a Lego piece from a book. “Eventually he stopped breathing,” Deputy Prosecuting Attorney Chase Murray said. “The autopsy showed body bruising, signs of strangulation and bleeding from the liver.” Nihipali’s wife, Kuuipo Nihipali, was also charged in connection with the case and agreed to testify against her spouse. Nihipali-Moniz and four other children under the care of the women suffered a series of abuses after moving in with the couple, Murray said. “They were beaten, choked and burned with hot water,” Murray said. The women told the children to lie to investigators about the death, but they eventually revealed what they witnessed, Murray said. Ashley Nihipal entered a plea agreement with prosecutors,...
