“The Navy’s planned land seizure threatens to devastate greater sage grouse breeding areas and migratory bird habitat at Stillwater National Wildlife Refuge," he said.
 Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who has campaigned for president multiple times in Nevada, said the Navy has failed to meaningfully consult with the Fallon Paiute-Shoshone Tribe about expansion concerns.
 “That’s unacceptable. As president, I’ll seek Tribal Nations’ free, prior, informed consent for decisions affecting their lands,” Warren tweeted Wednesday with a link to a tribal resolution condemning the expansion.
 The tribe says “since time immemorial” it has engaged in religious and cultural ceremonies on the ancestral lands that have been harmed by bombing, munitions, sonic booms and low-altitude flyovers.
 The Navy “is proposing to expand these horrible activities four-fold,” the National Congress of American Indians said in the resolution approved in October.
 The Navy's preferred alternative would ask Congress to renew the withdrawal of 316 square miles (818 sq. km) of public land that make up the current range, withdraw an additional 940 square miles (2,434 sq. km) of federal land for 25 years and acquire 102 square miles (264 sq. km) of private or state-owned land.
 The Fallon training complex is the Navy’s premier aviation training range, supporting aviation and ground training, including live-fire training. All naval strike aviation units and some Navy SEALS train at Fallon before deployment.

Now Mishustin will be tasked with fulfilling Putin's economic program, namely the National Projects to the tune of 26 trillion rubles ($424 bln) up to 2024. The program's slow implementation and weak economic growth were among the reasons Medvedev's government came under fire, the paper says. Mishustin's major achievement is turning the tax-collecting agency into a service tool, said Partner at Taxology Alexei Artyukh. He reformed the administration of major taxpayers and businesses can coordinate deals in advance in exchange for the Tax Service's access to companies' accounting systems. If these approaches are extended to other services, this would result in huge progress, he said.

ATLANTA (AP) — Corrections officials in Georgia are preparing to execute a man convicted of fatally shooting a convenience store clerk more than 30 years ago.
 Jimmy Fletcher Meders, 58, is scheduled to receive a lethal injection Thursday evening at the state prison in Jackson. He was convicted of murder and sentenced to die for the October 1987 killing of Don Anderson in coastal Glynn County.
 Meders' lawyers tried to get a court to order DNA testing on the gun used in the killing, saying that it could prove he wasn't the shooter and should have a new trial and sentencing. But a judge last week rejected that argument, saying there was “overwhelming evidence” in support of Meders' conviction.

The latest legislation expands those rights to domestic workers and those working in the public sector, the oil and gas industry, those employed at sea and those working in agriculture.
 A government statement said the ministerial decree is “another important step taken by the Government of Qatar to create a modern labour system that strengthens Qatar’s employment laws and protects the rights of all expatriate workers.”

The Democrats continue to suffer losses over the impeachment effort that has not stopped US President Donald Trump from gaining ground. According to analysts interviewed by Izvestia, the impeachment expectations by Trump's opponents do not live up to reality. In order to save face, the Democrats will insist on questioning new witnesses during the trial in the Senate, for example ex-National Security Adviser John Bolton, who was present during Trump's conversation with Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky. However, even if new evidence emerges, the US leader will be justified by his fellow party members. The only question is how long the trial in the Senate will last.

India has asked Bangladesh to procure the onions that it has imported after a majority of states withdrew their demand for the commodity.   At a meeting held on Monday, the Union Ministry of Commerce and Industry made an offer to acting Bangladesh high commissioner Rokebul Haque to buy the onion stock that India had imported for domestic consumption, Indian news website The Print reported citing a senior government official familiar with this on Tuesday.   But Bangladesh argued that it already has imports of Chinese onion in the pipeline through Nepal, so India should offer some incentives like free transportation, said the official, who didn't wish to be named.   He said that while India imported most of the stock at around $600-700 per metric tonnes (MT), the Indian government is offering it to Bangladesh at $550-$580 per MT.   As of 12 January, 18,000 MT of imported onions had arrived in India out of a total contract of 36,000 MT, the official said.   "Out of the amount of arrived onions, the state governments have only procured around 3,000 MT while the rest of the stock is waiting at Mumbai JNPT port," he added.   Maharashtra, Assam, Haryana, Karnataka and Odisha have withdrawn their demand of 10,000 MT, 3,000 MT, 3,480 MT, 250 MT and 100 MT of imported onion, respectively, consumer affairs minister Ram Vilas Paswan confirmed earlier this month.   The states had asked for imported onions to deflate the soaring prices - over Rs 100 per kg in November-December - of the commodity, but backed out citing high prices and difference in taste.   This has sparked concern that if states do not lift the imported onions, the commodity will perish. Onion is a highly perishable item which gets depreciated due to rotting and sprouting by 35 per cent in a week.

After the Panthers jumped out to a 20-0 lead in the second quarter, Gray got the Bulldogs on the board with a 3-pointer and scored again before the half to cut into the lead. Gray added another 3-pointer in the second half as Holtville equaled Elmore County’s total in the final 22 minutes of the game, losing 44-24.
 “We have a few girls who have come along and shooting the ball much better,” Holtville coach Jason Franklin said. “Holly Smith has been running the offense and Ashonti had a really good game tonight. It has been a culmination of everyone doing their job.”
 Franklin said he has seen a lot of improvement from Gray and the rest of the team over the last two seasons. He said Gray and the other leaders on the team have grown into the game and have caught up to the speed at the varsity level which goes a long way with a young team.
 “They are a little bit faster and up to speed with the game than the rest of the girls are so that helps a lot,” Franklin said. “Being coachable will get you a lot further than pure athletic ability and she started realizing that. She’s come a long way and I’m proud of her for that.”

Wu Gang, the chief naval architect of both projects, has mentioned on several occasions that the design of a heavy polar icebreaker was been in the works. In October, he stated that the MIIT had tasked the institute with developing the design for a heavy icebreaker. On the exhibition floor last month, representatives from the institute explained that they had been asked by the ministry to provide ideas for a polar icebreaker and air the design to potential buyers. It was mentioned that COSCO had shown interest at an earlier stage but this was apparently no longer the case. Yet local industry media speculate that the ship might start construction already in 2021, however, without providing any information as to why this would be the case. Another representative at the fair conceded that the market for heavy polar icebreakers remained rather small, and, if the vessel were to be built, it would most likely be as a result of government procurement.

Chufa is an exponentially-growing perennial grass-like plant from the rush family and is certainly cultivated in warm climates in moist & wet soils. The small round tubers found along the roots have a slight almond flavor and are eaten raw or cooked, or made into a traditional chufa drink called horchata. The plant's tubers comprehend high levels of protein, carbohydrate and oleic acid, and 20 to 28 percent of their mass in the form of a non-drying oil. The oil is obtained by pressing the cleaned tubers, in the same manner as traditional olive oil extraction. The oil has a mild, pleasant flavor and is considered as a food oil to be similar, but of superior quality, to olive oil. Industrial applications for the oil include high-value applications for cosmetics and instrument lubricants.

 Wetumpka’s girls team (3-8) got 15 points from Morgan Causey but there were not many other positives as Marbury won 54-34. As a team, Wetumpka shot 1-of-11 from beyond the 3-point arc.
 The boys team appeared to be having a better night when it jumped out to a double-digit lead in the first quarter but Wetumpka could not sustain it, falling 65-62 to Marbury. Tyquan Rawls led the team with 13 points but he was limited to just one field goal in the second half. Zeylin Hooks and Stone Minnifield added 12 points each.

Last Monday marked the first official day for baseball and softball teams to participate in throwing drills with the full roster. There are still some limitations on practice time and what can be done before the first day of practice Jan. 27 but the new period has brought plenty of excitement to teams around the county.
 “I think the biggest thing for us is finally getting together as a team,” Wetumpka baseball coach Michael Dismukes said. “We’re throwing and working on condition for five days in a row as a whole team. We want them to understand the grind of the day to day.”
 Wetumpka is using the early period to start the process of filling out its pitching staff as it has to replace a majority of innings pitched from last season. Mason Elmore, Dylan Shipley and Kyle Johnston have all graduated and ace Seth Johnson is not expected to pitch this season so Wetumpka hopes to get a better picture of the rotation as soon as possible.

Iran is facing fresh pressure to give a full accounting of what happened to the Ukrainian Airlines plane that was shot down over its capital city last week with 176 people on board.
 Ministers from five countries that lost citizens in the crash are due to meet in London later to demand answers.
 Ahead of the meeting, Canada's foreign minister said his country would "get to the very bottom" of what happened.
 Iran has said the plane was brought down by a missile fired in error.
 The plane, travelling to the Ukrainian capital Kiev and carrying many passengers on their way to Canada, was downed amid escalating tensions between Iran and the US. There were no survivors.
 Hours before, Iranian missiles had targeted two airbases in Iraq housing US forces.

To reduce environment related concern it is important to notice that the power plant has been built using ultra-supercritical technology, which has greater efficiency and lower emissions. It can fully capture bottom ash, fly ash, Sulphur and Nitrogen, all of which can harm the environment. Additionally, we expect the power plant's compliance and safety issues to be of highest standards.      We hope that the second unit of this project will start to supply power to the national grid within June this year, the projected time. We also hope that the power plant will run in full swing very soon, contributing to national greed with its maximum capacity. To finish with, it is essential for the joint energy authorities to ensure the cheapest possible manufacturing cost in the coming days.

It said the decree would not apply to members of the armed forces, and that companies could designate 5% of their workforce which must still seek prior approval to leave, due to their importance in the running of the firm. It said domestic workers “should” notify their employers 72 hours before departure.
 “The ILO warmly welcomes these changes, which will benefit many migrant workers in Qatar," said Houtan Homayounpour, the the head of the U.N. labor body's office working with Qatar. "The removal of exit permits is an important milestone in the government’s labour reform agenda.”
 Rights groups have long accused Qatar and other oil-rich Gulf nations — which rely heavily on migrant workers — of labor abuses. Qatar's hosting of soccer's world tournament in 2022 has shined a light on its practices and appears to have encouraged reforms.

More chaos erupted as Jeffery and David learned about the Cryer home. Jeffery knew about Wyatt’s potential threat, and if only he had said something it would have changed things. So much for the mystery, that damn TV spot revealed that Kathryn survived Wyatt’s shooting. Surprised we’re getting tons of narrative involving the Young family lately and rightfully so. Mitch has been waiting to talk to Candace for a long time, and finally got that opportunity, perhaps his grandmother helping take out that threat of hers was a big move in their right direction. This feels like a potential romance in the works, interesting, and it would be fun to see how things unfold.

We hadn't had the new microwave that long when, all of a sudden, it decided it just didn't want to microwave anymore.      "You had one job," I said to the microwave, chastising it after it failed to reheat some leftovers. "Is that really so hard?"      Naturally, I had no idea what went into making a microwave microwave. I assumed it probably had something to do with the sun, since it used microwaves, and maybe also radio waves or ultraviolet rays, and therefore there was surely a solar panel installed somewhere, that made it work, as well as a transistor radio and sunscreen. Since I had no experience with microwaves or radio waves or UV waves (except that one time when I was seven and I got a really bad sunburn), I thought this was all well out of my limited range of appliance repair knowledge and decided to call in a professional.      I looked online for a repairman in my area and chose Mike's Microwave repair because it had a number of good reviews and also, Mike and Microwave both begin with an M and I like alliteration. I had to wait two weeks for Mike to show up because apparently, there was a sudden epidemic of microwave deaths at the same time that mine pooped out. It was like some kind of microwave flu that must have been transmitted over the airwaves, or maybe the radio waves, I couldn't be certain.      By the time Mike finally arrived I was beside myself. I was a child of the microwave generation and never realized that food could also be reheated in an actual oven, so for two weeks I ate cold leftovers and brooded about how difficult life was without a microwave.      "I think it might be the fuse," said Mike when he finally arrived and did triage on my microwave. "It should be an easy fix, but there's a chance I might have to do open oven surgery. I need you to sign a release."      "A release?" I said. "For what?"      "Acknowledging that the appliance was not functioning when I arrived and nothing I did caused it to further malfunction."      "Fine," I said and signed the form. "But before you do anything, you should try pointing the satellite dish in a different direction to see if that solves the problem, because not only is the microwave broken, but also, our TV isn't getting very good reception."      He looked at me like I was one burner short of stovetop. "They have nothing to do with each other."      "What?" I said.      "Your microwave and your TV," he said. "Completely unrelated."      "Got it," I said. "But could you check the TV when you're done with the microwave, anyway?"      "I only do kitchen appliances," he said.      "But the TV is in the kitchen," I replied. Then I recalled that the ad said, Mike's Microwaves, and not Mike's Microwaves and TVs, so I decided to let it go.      I watched the one TV channel that worked well while Mike did surgery on the microwave. But when I decided to switch channels, all of a sudden, at the exact same time, the microwave whirred to life.      "Hah!" I yelled. "I fixed the microwave!"      "No, you didn't," said Mike. "I did. I put in a new fuse."      "I'm not so sure, Mike." I said assuredly. "I was on CNN and when I switched to HGTV, the microwave started to work again."      "I told you, they're not related," he argued.      I shrugged. "If you want to believe that, that's fine," I said. "I don't want to make waves."
