It featured short sleeves that extended just an inch or so past Katelyn's shoulders, and the entire garment was crafted from a delicate cream-colored lace fabric that looked gorgeous against Katelyn's bronzed skin.

And adjustments to the schedule are not the only changes that have been made.
 Facial coverings are required for all faculty, staff, students, visitors and vendors while in campus buildings. The masks must also be worn outdoors when safe social distancing is not possible. Cordle said the mask policy is for shared spaces; students in their residence hall rooms or employees working alone in their offices don’t have to wear them.
 Exceptions are also made for those participating in activities in which a face mask cannot be worn or would prohibit respiratory function, and for individuals with a recognized disability and have an accommodation that prevents the wearing of a mask.
 Residence halls capacities have been lowered, and many residential life services will be provided online.
 Cordle said the university recognizes that some students — including international students — who may not be able to return to campus as planned.
 “There are some elements that are out of our control and are out of their control,” he said. “They have to be able to come back into the country and that’s another topic with a lot of uncertainty right now. We are hoping for the best.”
 Students who experience a delay in returning to campus will be met with understanding and flexibility, Cordle said. With so much up in the air, the university has to remain committed to its ability to be flexible and adapt to an ever-changing landscape.
 “We are committed to having students on campus this fall and having face-to- face instruction, but we’re even more committed to doing everything we can to make the experience this fall as safe as we possibly can,” Cordle said. “We are also committed to flexibility, to being ready for anything and being ready to adapt to whatever circumstances we end up with.”

HUDSON DEEGAN DIRT BIKE MAGAZINE SHOOT: BEHIND THE SCENES

I would say April was the quietest part of this crisis so far. There was a really meaningful constriction of available capital. And a lot of people, understandably, were in a ‘wait and see’ pattern that has now definitely started to open up. May was the first inklings of that activity, and June has continued to open up. Retail deals are receiving an understandably much higher level of scrutiny in New York. I haven't been asked to do any hotel work recently, but I imagine that's going to be very challenging until occupancy rebounds. But overall, I would say underwriting is more conservative, interest reserves —whether static or otherwise — have become completely normal across the board for almost all deals.

The French 1866 Chassepot was another second-generation breechloader, a bolt- action, single-shot weapon taking 11mm paper and card cartridges; but again, the Ethiopians also had larger numbers of more modern 1871 Le Gras rifles, in which the Chassepot's paper cartridges were replaced with 11mm brass rounds. Menelik's warriors even had some 1886 Lebel 8mm bolt-action magazine rifles; with eight cartridges in the tubular magazine below the barrel, one in the cradle behind the chamber and one `up the spout', these took ten rounds. The Lebel's smaller-bore, smokeless-powder ammunition was the most advanced in the world (all the other types took black-powder rounds, which produced a giveaway cloud of white smoke and fouled the chamber fairly quickly with continuous firing).

“We can see that throughout history, [African Americans] have experienced a series of legal, social and political activity that has made it justifiably legal to dehumanize an entire group of people,” Allen said. “Some of that foundation has supported current legislation, and when I say current or contemporary, what I mean is from the 1960s all the way up until now … Those that had the power were not comfortable with sharing that power, and so they cut it off and they reverted back to old philosophies … there’s been times that we’ve attempted to reconstruct, and when we fail, we continue to build layers, and layers and layers onto that [way of thinking.]”
 Allen drove his points home on systemic racism by posing questions to the audience concerning their life experiences, his main point being that white individuals may not have to live with the same caution or awareness as often as those in marginalized communities.
 “In talking about white privilege, it could be anything from going to the store and buying band-aids … when I take one out of the package, it comes out to my own [lighter] skin color,” ESU Associate Professor of Communication and Theatre Sheryl Lidzy. “You can’t even see it on my arm because it’s considered ‘nude’ colored or whatever they consider the standard. But it can also mean that when I go to the store, I don’t have to question whether or not I’m going to be followed around making sure I don’t steal anything. Those with white privilege don’t think twice about most of our activities on a daily basis.”
 Many parts of American culture, Allen added, have been tailored to white individuals simply because they have maintained the majority of the power throughout the country’s history.

But signs of progress by retailers hoping to recover some lost business due to COVID-19 have suddenly been mitigated by increasing health concerns. New coronavirus cases around the country topped 45,000 on Wednesday, setting a record for a single-day increase in the U.S. States such as Texas, Florida, California and Arizona have all seen spikes in COVID-19 cases. It's believed some localities restarted their economies too quickly and saw many people not wearing masks and social distancing. On Thursday, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott put a pause on any further reopenings, though firms already back in business could continue to operate under the state's health guidelines.

And while that “punishment,” financially speaking, is a mere slap on the wrist and probably should have been more severe, the real value is that for the first time in decades, the attendance at Bilderberg by an elected public official is being associated with backroom dealings and illicit influence in an open public forum—which is a far cry from largely ineffectual protests and other now-routine activities outside Bilderberg’s remote, highly secretive annual meetings—activities that can scarcely pose a major threat to Bilderberg, although the alternative media’s frequent exposure of Bilderberg has undoubtedly slowed the group’s advancement.

Embattled comedian Chris D'elia's team has made the surprising move of releasing a number of email exchanges between the star and his sexual abuse accusers as he fires back at the allegations.
 The You actor has denied accusations suggesting he attempted to groom and solicit photos from underage girls online, insisting he "never knowingly" pursued relationships with minors, and claiming he didn't know any of the females making allegations of inappropriate behaviour against him via social media.
 However, after a number of females came forward on social media with claims about D'Elia's inappropriate conduct over the years, the star fired back by sharing a string of email receipts between himself and the women with the New York Post's gossip column Page Six, which apparently paint a fuller picture of the incidents.
 One series of emails between D'Elia and Clara Schaller, a woman who previous posted emails from 2012 on Twitter in which D'Elia said he wanted to have "naked sex" with her when she was 17, shows that D'Elia had allegedly asked her approximately midway through their exchange, "How old are you?"
 She replied "12," apparently kidding. He responded, "Answerrrrr," to which she said, "24?"
 Another woman, named Colleen Riley, posted a 2014 message from the Whitney star in which he asked her to "make out," followed by another in which she said, "Chris, I'm 16." However, D'Elia's team shared another email in that chain, in which he allegedly replied, "Oh s--. I thought you were at my (standup) show. Gotta be 18 (to get into that) at least. My bad. Bye."
 Finally, they released an email from Simone Rossi, one of the first women to accuse D'Elia of misconduct, after she told the Los Angeles Times that she had an online exchange with D’Elia in 2015 when she was 16, and claimed that he'd asked her to "make out" and send him pictures of herself.
 In the emails from D'Elia's camp's, however, Rossi allegedly wrote to D'Elia again in 2019, saying "I'm 21 now and (down to f--)." His reps added that D'Elia didn't respond to her.
 Following the allegations, the star has been dumped by his talent agents and his manager, and a number of his shows have been pulled from streaming sites.

We had a nice pace of business prior to this, running at one to two closings a week for a few years. And I would really like to return to that level, because that feels like a foundation upon which we can grow. But I would certainly say that my intention is to grow the business. I think that there's a lot of talented people in New York City who would add value to the team. And the bigger we are, I think, the better we serve our clients. So, I'm going to continue to work towards that goal. I don't know if it will be this year or will be next year. We have a lot of questions to answer before we can make plans. I've been told that learning to go with the flow is going to be important for when my first child arrives in about 60 days. So, I'm trying to practice that now.

Ethiopians favoured a half-moon formation in order to outflank and envelop an enemy, although extreme terrain often made this impossible. Despite having a general plan, warriors fought more or less as individuals, advancing and retreating as they saw fit. Chiefs only had a loose control over their men, and never kept them in close formation except for the final charge, when everyone bunched together and hurried to be the first to reach the foe. Considering the lethal effectiveness of late 19th-century rifles, this loose mode of fighting was actually in advance of its day. The Ethiopian tendency was to get in close to ensure a good shot, although rushing en masse when the enemy appeared weak did lead to great losses. The Italian army, especially the ascari, showed good discipline under fire, and inflicted heavy casualties on the Ethiopians; the majority of these tended to be suffered during the final rush. When charging, the Ethiopians used various battle cries depending on their origin: the Oromo shouted `Slay! Slay!', while warriors from Gojjam cried `God pardon us, Christ!', and those from Shewa rallied to the call `Together! Together!'
