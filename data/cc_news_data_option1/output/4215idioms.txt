Yes, these are "wired wireless" headphones -- with a cable connecting the left and right earbud -- at a time when budget true wireless earbuds are widely available for $50 or less, some of which are surprisingly good. For a lot of people that pesky wire is a dealbreaker, and I personally hadn't regularly used a neckband-style headphone for a couple of years, so it was a bit of an adjustment to go back to it.
 But some people like the concept. You can leave the earbuds dangling from around your neck, wearing them like a pendant. Gone is the fear of losing an AirPod by dropping it. Going from listening to not listening to the earbuds requires simply lifting them to your ears -- or pulling them out. And forget about having to drop them in a charging case when you're not using them.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court will allow Pennsylvania to count ballots received up to three days after the election, rejecting a Republican plea. The justices divided 4-4 Monday, an outcome that upholds a state Supreme Court ruling that allowed election officials to receive and count ballots until Nov. 6, even if they don't have a clear postmark. Republicans, including President Donald Trump’s campaign, have opposed such an extension, arguing that it violates federal law that sets Election Day as the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November and that such a decision constitutionally belongs to lawmakers, not the courts. The state Democratic Party and its allies had sought an extension of Pennsylvania’s Election Day deadline to count mailed ballots because Democratic-registered voters are requesting mail ballots at a nearly 3-to-1 ratio over Republicans. In its Sept. 17 ruling, the divided state Supreme Court said ballots must be postmarked by the time polls close and be received by county election boards at 5 p.m. on Nov. 6, three days after the Nov. 3 election. It also said that ballots lacking a clear postmark could be counted unless there was evidence that they were mailed after the polls closed.

The Dolphins offense put together three first-half touchdown drives to give them a 21-0 lead, but the Dolphins had lots of opportunities to put more points on the board and failed. They had good field position and started numerous drives in Jets territory only to squander their opportunities and come away with no points. Right before the half, Ryan Fitzpatrick threw a bad interception in the red zone which took away a golden scoring opportunity for Miami. The Dolphins should have had no worse than a field goal before the half to add to their lead.

I had moved into my own apartment and found myself frequently curled up in the center of the carpet, tensing my muscles on and off. I had a little red car and would drive for hours at night, I mean hundreds and hundreds of miles. The idea was to stave off being alone with my thoughts, and usually the road and the radio helped. I found with depression that there was a kind of perpetual disbelief, one that I think made its way into my interactions with other people and made me seem weird, or weirder - what is this thing, inside of me? And I think I looked to other people for answers even as I said nothing coherent about having depression at all. I would hang out with people to avoid the depression and tell them nothing about my struggles and would leave disappointed that no one had diagnosed me even as I never really interrogated what was going on inside of me myself.

MURRELLS INLET — An old-fashioned they-said-they-said is breaking out in the case of the St. James High junior varsity football team participating in a game on Thursday night in Sumter after two known cases existed on the team.
 Horry County Schools released an extensive timeline of the what occurred last week — which has led to both teams now being in mandatory quarantine — which included the following passage:
 “The two JV players received their SCDHEC-confirmed positive COVID-19 test results on Thursday, October 15. The last time they were in contact with their team was on Tuesday, October 13. SCDHEC, who was consulted with every step, determined that the JV football game could continue between SJHS and Sumter High School. The two SCDHEC-confirmed positive students began their quarantine on this day and did not attend or participate in the game against Sumter,” the district said.
 When the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control was contacted by the Post and Courier Myrtle Beach on Monday, the state agency was clear that they don’t have the authority to dictate whether a team can play or not.

If you’ve been buying iPhones for some time, you probably have plenty of tiny “power bricks” you can use to charge your new iPhone 12 via its Lightning connection. You’ll be able to charge it even faster if you have a higher-watt power adaptor — everything from an iPad power adaptor to your MacBook’s power adaptor is fair game.
 If an iPhone 12 is your very first iPhone, or you’ve just been lazy about saving those power adapters, you’ll need to purchase one yourself. Apple isn’t including them in the box anymore — just a USB C-to-Lightning cable. While Apple has dropped the price of its 20W USB-C power adaptor by $15 _(ooh, ahh)_ to account for this, you can do better than that.
 This Anker model is just as good, but cheaper, as is this Aukey charger — both Wirecutter favourites. I love combo chargers myself; they give you speedier USB-C charging for your iPhone along with a USB-A port for all the other devices you own. Oh, and they’ll still be cheaper than Apple’s single-port charger.

“I look up and down the nine guys on the roster and each of them have a unique story,” Leach said. “First-round draft picks like Blake Snell and Shane McClanahan to Willy Adames to Mike Brosseau, who was a non-drafted free agent.
 “... Kevin Kiermaier has won two gold gloves and a platinum glove and he was a 31st round draft pick. It’s all across the board and so many of them got their start here and really started to excel here.”
 Floro, who was 9-2 with a 1.81 ERA when he pitched for the Hot Rods in 2013, has been part of the Dodgers bullpen.
 Kiermaier is the oldest of the former Hot Rods on the Rays roster, playing in Bowling Green in 2011. Floro is one of two former Hot Rods - along with Snell - to play in 2013. The Hot Rods have at least one player from each season from 2013-2019 on the Rays' ALCS roster. The 2016 Hot Rods team featured three players on the Rays roster - Castillo, Lowe and Alverado.
 “Out of the 10 guys who could possibly play in the World Series that donned Hot Rods jerseys, only one of them is over 30 years old or at 30 years old - and it’s Kevin Kiermaier,” Leach said. “These guys are young. Hopefully the Rays can sign them and continue it. They’ve got a bright, bright future. The Rays' farm system is No. 1 in all of minor league baseball, so they have even more talent coming up. It speaks volumes for how the Rays draft and how they develop players for the big leagues.”
 To celebrate the former Hot Rods in the World Series, BG will host a watch party for Wednesday’s Game 2.
 The Reinhart Club will open at 6 p.m. with 20 tables available for a special menu. Anyone interested can make reservations by calling the Hot Rods front office or emailing estahl@vettecitycatering.
 “It’s going to be fun,” Leach said. “With such a short turnaround we decided to go with Game 2 on Wednesday. It will be cool to have some season ticket holders and fans watch our former Hot Rods hopefully shine and hopefully bring the Rays a championship.”

Nearly 10,000 sex workers have written an open letter condemning an appeal from a prominent anti human trafficking activist, Sunitha Krishnan, to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) to withdraw its advisory to the Union government that sex workers be treated on par with informal workers.
 On October 7, the NHRC issued a “human rights advisory” on protection of women’s rights in the context of COVID-19 following an impact assessment done by a Committee of Experts. It recommended that State governments must provide assistance and COVID-19 relief to sex workers; recognise their vulnerability to domestic violence and ensure their protection; and ensure free testing and treatment for COVID-19. But the most important and landmark suggestion was on recognising sex work as work and including women who perform it as informal workers.
 But days following the advisory, Sunitha Krishnan, founder of the NGO Prajwala, wrote to the NHRC calling its advisory on sex workers an “aberration”, that there was “no concept of sex work”, and that recognising it as such would be tantamount to “human rights violation” and legitimising sexual exploitation. This letter sparked widespread outrage among sex workers’ collectives, academics, gender rights activists, lawyers and public health experts.
 On Monday, the total number of signatories to the open letter crossed 11,000, and more endorsements were pouring in. These included 1,000 gender rights activists and over 250 NGOs such as the Forum Against Oppression of Women, ANANDI, National Alliance for People’s Movement, Naz Foundation, and Lawyers’ Collective. They criticised Prajwala’s letter for “its myopic and moralistic objection” to the rights of vulnerable communities such as sex workers.
 Their letter states, “By denying the fact that these women are citizens and workers, instead reducing them merely to victims of sexual violence the [Prajwala’s] letter divests them of basic rights and entitlements that fundamentally acknowledge that they are even human...and ignores the voices of millions of adult women who independently sustain themselves and their families through sex work.” It adds that Prajwala makes the oft repeated mistake of conflating voluntary adult sex work with sexual exploitation.
 Aarthi Pai, lawyer and executive director, Sangram Sanstha, explains the import of the NHRC advisory according the status of informal workers to sex workers and says, “The understanding of sex workers as informal sector workers is a move forward not just for the immediate pandemic but also the medium to long-term benefit that they will get. Immediately, this makes sense because there is a call from informal workers for some sort of compensation package in light of unemployment due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Several State governments have been looking at this. There is an important SC judgment that says that even if sex workers don’t have documentation, they must get ration, which is extremely helpful. But their recognition as out-of-work workers and their right to unemployment benefits moves the discussion to the next level, where you are looking at their demands through the rubric of worker’s rights.”

 Western Kentucky's most recent loss was at UAB on Saturday. The Hilltoppers lost at Louisville to open the season, and fell to Liberty and Marshall at home.
 The Power Five Cardinals haven't won since facing the Hilltoppers, but Liberty is undefeated at 5-0 and Marshall is 4-0. UAB's only loss was to now-No. 11 Miami. The Thundering Herd are ranked 22nd in the AP Top 25 and 25th in the USA Today Coaches' Poll, while Liberty and UAB received votes in both.
 "It's easy for us to take the easy way out and say, 'OK, you're sitting here at 1-4, but look at who you played.' Is that a reality? Yes. We very easily could have played really good football and still been 1-4, and we've talked about that as a team, but I've said it and I'll say it again – our goal is always to win championships, and you have to not be concerned with how good is the opponent that you're going to play," Helton said.
 " ... This football team is never going to make excuses and say we're 1-4 because we played some really good, talented football teams. You've heard me say if you want to be the best, you've got to beat the best. So far, the teams we've played, they're pretty good from a talent standpoint."
