“ We’ve not experienced yet major disruptions to supply chains that have caused our capital projects to come to a halt,” Bernal said. “If we defer capital improvements and capital outlays, that is something that we would likely be looking at more so for the next fiscal year. … We’re not looking at issuing new bonds at this point or starting new projects, but merely completing what was already in the works and where funding was already available.”

HOLLAND -- A local doctor said he is treating every patient that he sees as if they have the novel coronavirus. Rob Davidson, an emergency room doctor, chair of The Committee to Protect Medicare and former congressional candidate, said he's operating with increased caution as COVID-19 cases rise.
   
 "It has really changed our routine at the hospital," Davidson said. "We're treating everyone who comes in as if they're infected. It's altered the way we do business.
   
 "My old practice was to shake hands, sit on the end of the bed," Davidson said. "But now I'm trying to limit my time in the room. I'm sitting at the doorway, staying six feet away. We're limiting the number of times we go back in the room. If we have someone who is very likely positive, we're using telephones to call into the room to give updates instead of going back in. It's been a change."
   
 The national shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) is being felt locally as well, Davidson said.
   
 "We're wearing N95s, we have one for five shifts," he said. "Simply because the number available would run out if we did it any other way, we have to conserve those.
   
 "Ideally, we'd have one per patient. You use it, then discard it. We have to use one for five shifts. We are using the best data we have to say this is OK. It's better this way than to run out in four or five days."
   
 Davidson said that all people should assume they've been exposed to the coronavirus if they've been in contact with other people due to indications of community spread. Not everyone who has been exposed or has symptoms of the disease needs to go to the hospital, though. Most symptoms are manageable from home, Davidson said, but anyone experiencing shortness of breath should seek treatment.
   
 "The real deal is everyone should assume they've been exposed if they've been around another person," he said. "Cough, fever, body aches, loss of taste and smell, if you have these and it's manageable, isolate yourself. If you have shortness of breath, that's when you should go to the hospital. This virus can cause viral pneumonia. Those are the folks who need oxygen and sometimes need to be intubated."
   
 Obeying stay-at-home orders and increasing testing capacity are keys to recovering from the virus as a state and country, Davidson said.
   
 "What everybody can do is stay home and away from other people as much as possible," he said. "That's the only way we can get out of this. Trying to cut corners is a recipe for disaster. If we don't test enough and we pull out of the stay-at-home order too quickly, then we get a surge in cases two months later. That's what we need to avoid."
   
 In the absence of widespread testing, people with lesser symptoms or at lower risk are typically being advised to isolate at home.
   
 "That works if people listen, but they never get tested and counted among the positives," Davidson said. "We don't know the true prevalence of the disease. My worry is that if you aren't able to convince people how important it is if you don't have a positive test."
   
 Davidson added that the solution to the lack of PPE and testing needs to come from the federal level.
   
 "The only way it happens correctly is if the federal government and president fully implement the Defense Powers Act," he said. "They need to go to manufacturers and mandate what to produce. Tell us in a transparent way who is going to make what, how much and how to facilitate it.
   
 "There's a finite number of resources and a lot of places in need."
