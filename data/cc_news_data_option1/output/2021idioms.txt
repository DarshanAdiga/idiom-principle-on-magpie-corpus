WORCESTER - Monday's the day for many adult-use marijuana stores, as a two- month prohibition on recreational sales due to the coronavirus pandemic ends.
 "We're very excited to get back open again and be able to provide access to adult-use customers again," said Amanda Rositano, president of New England Treatment Access, a company with co-located medical and adult-use dispensaries in Northampton and Brookline. (The Brookline dispensary will open for recreational sales on Tuesday). "We're grateful for the governor's recognition that we can operate safely ... in addition, we're very appreciative of the Cannabis Control Commission's continued support for opening adult use."
 But dispensaries and cannabis advocates said that the required social distancing and curbside delivery will make for a different experience than the celebratory openings of the past that were marked by big crowds and long lines. And they are asking for a little understanding.
 "It's exciting, it's great that you can now go to a dispensary again and get a choice of product, but please be patient," said Peter DeCaro, CEO of Resinate, whose medical dispensary in Worcester received approval to open March 24 just as the pandemic closures began. The company is awaiting approval for its co- located adult-use store to open.
 "My advice to everyone is to take this very seriously and to focus on your patient and consumer and employee safety and execute to the best of your ability," DeCaro added. "It may sound like a no-brainer, but we are still in just the phase 1 of reopening in Massachusetts and we're hearing reports of potential mutations of COVID. We have a period of time where we need to ensure consumer, patient and employee responsibility to the best of our ability."
 Rositano concurred.
 "Our capacity is going to be dramatically, dramatically limited by the COVID environment itself and by the need to operate curbside," she said. "To ensure everyone's safety and maintain proper social distancing, and make sure we don't have crowding ... we will be able to serve less customers than we would typically see in a non-COVID environment."
 Gov. Charlie Baker shuttered adult-use marijuana stores in late March as part of an order to close nonessential businesses due to coronavirus.
 Medical dispensaries were declared essential businesses and allowed to remain open.
 But many cannapreneurs and members of the CCC worried about the nascent industry's survival, saying recreational sales accounted for 80% of business at co-located recreational and medical dispensaries. Adding to their worries, cannabis businesses are excluded from government relief funds because marijuana remains illegal federally.
 The industry rallied together to press their case for reopening.
 Many argued that a significant number of recreational consumers used for medical reasons. Other arguments included that other states with recreational marijuana had deemed it essential; that the industry was intended to be regulated like the alcohol industry, which was considered essential; that veterans who were treated through the Veterans Administration could not be prescribed medical marijuana because it remained federally illegal; and that the shutdown would doom the budding industry.
 David Torrisi, president of the Commonwealth Dispensary Association, a group representing about 40 members in the cannabis industry, said that the group and others have been lobbying the Baker-Polito administration since the shutdown began in March.
 Other industry players tried to go through the courts. Others tried through legislation. Neither of those two efforts were successful.
 But what was successful appears to have been a group of industry representatives - including Torrisi, Rositano and others - stating their case for safety to members of the governor's Reopening Advisory Board, headed by Lt. Gov. Karyn Polito, on May 9.
 "When we made the pitch to the Reopening Advisory Board it was about safety, safety, safety," Torrisi said. "It wasn't about how much money we lost, customers we weren't able to serve, or about our bottom line; it was about safety."
 Moreover, advocates were able to point to success. Medical dispensaries had been successfully operating with social-distancing guidelines and curbside pickup options since March.
 "The most important point for us to stress as an industry is that we have been operating safely and effectively as an essential service since the beginning of the crisis ... as an essential service for medical customers," Rositano said.
 She also noted that unlike in most retail environments, customers do not handle marijuana or marijuana products until the point of sale - there is no "browsing" and touching and picking up and replacing product.
 Moreover, the industry already operates under strict health and safety codes. In many ways it's uniquely suited to operate during a pandemic, those interviewed noted.
 When the Reopening Board released its plan, adult-use shops were included with all other retail operations, allowed to open for curbside pickup on May 25. The state declined to comment on the record about the adult-use cannabis industry's appearance before the board.
 But things will look different in a COVID-19 environment.
 "It really turns the dispensaries into fulfillment centers rather than brick- and-mortar retailers - it's a bit of a paradigm shift," said Curaleaf CEO Joe Lusardi. Curaleaf has a co-located medical and recreational dispensary in Oxford.
 The CCC published guidelines on Wednesday to detail what curbside pickup can look like, but it will be slightly different depending on each store.
 Some plans are still under discussion as of deadline, but each of the stores whose representatives were interviewed - NETA, Curaleaf and Good Chemistry - are relying primarily on online ordering and notifying customers when their order is ready for pickup.
 NETA, for instance, is asking adult-use customers to order online and schedule a specific pickup time.
 Lusardi, of Curaleaf, described it like picking up any other kind of legal drug.
 "We'll direct you to our website, do an online transaction, reserve your order, show up and pay for it, and receive the order much like a prescription," Lusardi said. "We'll be using an electronic waitlisting system so we can tell someone that their slot to pick up their product is between x and y a time. Hopefully it will really control the flow of customers."
 Good Chemistry, in the Canal District, may have some lines because of a lack of ready nearby parking. But they are reminding customers to practice social distancing and to wear a mask. Again, they are using online ordering for day- of pickup. Ordering begins each day at 9 a.m. and pickups are between 10 a.m. and 9 p.m. Customers will receive a confirmation text message when their order is available.
 Those interviewed expect high demand.
 "We expect to do a brisk business at all of our stores," Torrisi said. "Our members are excited ... they've only been doing curbside to medical patients for a short amount of time, now extending it, so we're asking for peoples' patience."
 That could benefit the industry in the future, Torrisi said.
 "If we operate safely and our customers are understanding and behave accordingly, we would maybe be allowed to open if - God forbid - there was another shutdown," Torrisi said. "We're asking for peoples' patience. Customers are under the microscope as well as the stores."

2002 SECOND ROUND
 This is the second of a seven-part series recapping classic games in NAIA World Series history.
 Since the NAIA World Series returned to Lewiston in 2000, the second day of play, weather permitting, usually starts with two elimination games. Some of the best games in the tournament are played by teams fighting to keep their dreams alive. Many pre-tournament pitching rotations are trashed when it comes down to do-or-die games, and coaches take more risks to move on in the bracket.
 In the first elimination game in 2002, Embry-Riddle trailed Indiana Tech by seven runs in the bottom of the seventh, and 12-10 with one out in the ninth. But the Eagles rallied and won the game 13-12 on a walk-off single to advance.
 Watching and warming up on the sideline were the Bellevue Bruins and Olivet Nazarene Tigers. Their scheduled noon game had been pushed back an hour because of the length of the first game. The Bruins had lost their opener to eventual champion Lewis-Clark State 13-0, and Olivet fell to Oklahoma City, who would finish runner-up, 14-6.
 Bellevue, the 1995 NAIA World Series champ, was making its seventh appearance, and fifth straight, while the Tigers were in their initial series. The Bruins, coached by the clipboard-carrying Mike Evans, had experienced playing in the series previously in Iowa, Oklahoma, Florida and the previous two tournaments in Lewiston. The Nebraska team made their 14th series appearance in 2019, going 2-2, and is still seeking its second title.
 In the second elimination game, Bellevue was trailing 4-3 in the sixth inning, when Olivet coach Elliot Johnson sensed his starting pitcher had tired and motioned his shortstop, Ben Zobrist, to the mound. Johnson, the brother of former Seattle Mariner manager Darrell Johnson, used Zobrist as his closer all season in the last inning, but was in a win-or-go-home situation, so he called in the reliever early.
 Apparently eight warmup pitches were not enough for Zobrist, as his first pitch was lined to right-center to tie the score at 4. Zobrist would atone for the mistake himself with a solo home run in the eighth, putting the Tigers back on top 5-4.
 Then in the ninth, the Bruins got the tying run at third base with left fielder Chad Keefer at the plate. Keefer, a junior from Coeur d’Alene, fell behind 0-2 before fouling off six consecutive pitches. Johnson took a trip to the mound to give Zobrist a break, but the plan backfired on the next pitch as Keefer produced a game-tying single.
 An inning later, Olivet’s Tony Sykes’ two-out walk-off home run sent the Bruins home, and the Tigers to another elimination game. For Olivet, it would be its last NAIA World Series victory, as the Tigers were eliminated by Ohio Dominican in their next game, then went 0-2 in the 2003 series, their last appearance to date.
 Bellevue second baseman T.J. Bohn was drafted after the series, and made his major league debut with the Seattle Mariners in 2006. Zobrist returned to Lewiston with Olivet in 2003, and was named to the NAIA All-American team. After transferring to Dallas Baptist for his senior year, Zobrist was drafted by the Houston Astros. Although he never won an NAIA World Series title, Zobrist achieved the feat in the major leagues. After playing for the World Series runner-up Tampa Bay Rays in 2008, he became a two-time World Series champion in 2015 (Kansas City) and 2016 (Chicago Cubs).
 NAIA tidbit
 There have been nine former major league players that have been head coaches of NAIA World Series teams.
 Chris Bando was the last former major leaguer to coach in the Series, bringing San Diego Christian to Lewiston in 2014. Bando had a nine-year professional career with the Cleveland Indians, Detroit Tigers and ending with the Oakland Athletics in 1989. Bando’s brother, third baseman Sal, spent 16 years in the majors. Chris, whose Hawks went 0-2 in their only series appearance, currently is the manager of the Texas AirHogs of the American Association of Independent Professional Baseball.
 The only NAIA World Series that had two former major leaguers coaching at the same time took place in 1965. That season, Anderson College made its first- ever appearance and were coached by former Dodger Carl Erskine. Erskine played his entire career for Brooklyn and Los Angeles from 1948-59, and pitched two no-hitters. His roommate for 10 years was Dodger great Duke Snider. Snider himself had a connection with the NAIA World Series. In 1971, his son, Kevin, became the only player in the history of the series to lead off a game with an inside-the-park home run. The Grand Canyon right fielder hit the second pitch of the game off a Linfield College pitcher into deep center.
 Another former Dodger pitcher, Ray Benge, was the head coach of Sam Houston State in the 1965 series, held in St. Joseph, Mo. Benge won 101 games in the majors in the 1930s. He and his Bearkats were making their sixth consecutive series appearance. Benge’s team was the 1963 NAIA World Series champs, and he was named the NAIA coach of the year in 1964.
 The two ex-Dodger pitchers did not get the chance to meet each other in the series. Erskine’s Ravens went 0-2, losing to Western Washington and Wisconsin- Whitewater. Benge’s Sam Houston team went 2-2, finishing in fourth place.

This brings us face to face with the dogmatic stand the Catholic Church takes about divorce. Divorce is projected, with a massive theological and doctrinal scaffolding, as contrary to the will of God; as though everything about the brutal patriarchal nature of the church is strictly in conformity with the will of God! The practical-historical reason for the stiff resistance of the church (akin to the fundamentalist Muslim defence of triple talaq) to making divorce more humane, and less harrowing, to women is sheer pragmatism. The church knows that the institution of monogamous marriage is riddled with adultery. The male, by virtue of greater freedom of movement and control over resources, is free, in this model of family, to be sexually promiscuous. He is. The woman is kept under bit and bridle. She acquiesces; but does so, as the system knows, out of helplessness. Families, as a result, smoulder in resentment and oppression. The situation is highly volatile. It could erupt, unless the lid is hammered down tight on it by making divorce impossibly impractical for women.

Enservco Corporation (ENSV) shares on Thursday's trading session, dropped -4.77 percent to see the stock exchange hands at $0.16 per unit. Lets a quick look at company’s past reported and future predictions of growth using the EPS Growth. EPS growth is a percentage change in standardized earnings per share over the trailing-twelve-month period to the current year-end. The company posted a value of -$0.10 as earning-per-share over the last full year, while a chance, will post -$0.08 for the coming year. The current EPS Growth rate for the company during the year is -25.80% and predicted to reach at 53.30% for the coming year. In-depth, if we analyze for the long-term EPS Growth, the out-come was -24.10% for the past five years and the scenario is totally different as the current prediction is 20.00% for the next five year.

The total figures for congregate care facilities in each county have meanwhile become impossible to fully parse. Where the state used to simply report countywide totals for those facilities, it now lists each individual facility’s numbers but replaces any number below five with an asterisk. As such, it can only be said that at least 1,630 of the county’s cases and 393 deaths are attributable to those facilities under the figures released Tuesday.
 The state reported Thursday that there are now 65,392 COVID-19 cases statewide and 4,869 total deaths attributed to COVID-19. Of those, 14,113 are attributed to resident cases in long-term care facilities and 2,306 cases among employees there as of Thursday, for a total of 16,419 cases at 570 distinct facilities in 44 counties. Out of the county's total deaths, 3,234 have occurred in residents from nursing or personal-care facilities.
 That is an increase of about 1,000 resident cases since Tuesday and nearly 100 new deaths, with no new information provided on where those occurred.
 Department of Health spokesman Nate Wardle said the state anticipated being able to use facility-submitted data in its daily updates, but some facilities reported incomplete information and others did not report as ordered, so the state is looking to provide the information through another data method.
 “As soon as we have complete data reported to us, we will use the facility- reported data for this count,” he said.
 The discrepancies may appear small, but are important for Delaware County, which is expected to move from “red” to “yellow” on June 5 under a color-coded reopening system put in place by Gov. Tom Wolf.
 Delaware County Council urged the governor to break out long-term care facility data in calculating new cases, which would allow the county to more quickly move into the “yellow” phase. Council Chairman Brian Zidek said in a video update Wednesday that county government has very little authority to unilaterally move the county forward.
 Zidek said council is in daily contact with neighboring counties and with Wolf’s office, sometimes multiple times per day, and said council has stressed repeatedly to the governor that Southeastern Pennsylvania does not look like Northeast Pennsylvania and that measuring both by the same metric was not helpful. He indicated there might be some movement coming from Harrisburg on that front this week, though he was unsure of exactly what that might entail.
 “There does seem to be some light at the end of the tunnel here,” Zidek said. “The numbers of positive tests that we get are coming down and have been coming down in recent days. Over the last three days, we had 56 positive cases, 71 positive cases and 69 positive cases. That is down significantly from where we were when we had 150 positive cases per day seemingly stretching for weeks and weeks and weeks.”
 While encouraging, Zidek urged residents to continue social distancing, mask wearing and hand washing measures in an effort to keep themselves and others safe, especially as the Memorial Day weekend typically full of barbequing and beach-going approaches.

Longtime _American Idol_   executive producers Nigel Lythgoe and Ken Warwick won't be returning to the   singing competitions series next season, a Fox spokesperson confirmed on Saturday.
 "The passion and dedication that Nigel Lythgoe and Ken Warwick   brought to _American Idol_ guided the   show to become a true cultural phenomenon," said Fox, FremantleMedia and 19   Entertainment in a joint statement.

The Premier League announced Saturday that there were positive tests at two clubs out of 996 tests conducted on Tuesday, Thursday and Friday.
 The other positive was at a different club which has not been named.
 That followed a first round of testing that produced six positive findings announced on May 19 at three Premier League clubs from a total of 748 players and staff.
 Those positives included Watford's Adrian Mariappa and Burnley assistant manager Ian Woan.
 For the second round, the number of tests available to each club was increased from 40 to 50.
 On Tuesday, squads started non-contact training for the first time since the Premier League was suspended on March 13.
 That an increased number of tests has produced fewer positive findings may be a boost to the Premier League's 'Project Restart' plan to resume fixtures in June. Clubs are expected to discuss moving to contact training on Tuesday.
 Officials still plan to complete all 92 remaining fixtures, with Premier League chief executive Richard Masters saying on Friday that they were "as confident as we can be" about restarting next month.
 Several players still have concerns about returning, among them Watford captain Troy Deeney and Chelsea midfielder N'Golo Kante, who stayed away from training this week.
 As well as Mariappa, two members of Watford's staff have tested positive, while Hornets manager Nigel Pearson revealed on Friday that several of his players were isolating at home after family members contracted the virus.
 Meanwhile, the English Football League announced Sunday that two unnamed individuals at the same Championship club had produced positive results after conducting tests on 1,014 players and staff at all 24 Championship clubs over the past 72 hours.
 As with the Premier League, the small number of positive tests will encourage those who want to see the Championship season resume next month.
 Elsewhere in Europe, Germany's Bundesliga has resumed behind closed doors while on Saturday the Spanish Prime Minister, Pedro Sanchez, announced La Liga could restart in the week of June 8.

Co-living operator Stanza Living will invest Rs 400 crore over the next two years on expansion as it sees opportunities in the rental accommodation business despite the coronavirus-triggered slowdown. Founded in 2017, Stanza Living has so far raised USD 70 million from investors like Falcon Edge Capital, Sequoia Capital, Accel, Matrix Partners and Alteria Capital. It currently has 200 centres across 14 cities with a total capacity of 55,000 beds, which are being provided in the price range of Rs 4,000-25,000 per bed. We are seeing a limited impact on our business. Our revenue has been hit marginally by around 2 per cent. Most of the students have gone back to their home but they are occupying our beds and paying rents, Stanza Living Co- founder and MD Anindya Dutta said. The company has given some relief to its student members by providing discounts on rentals, he added. Dutta expressed confidence about the growth potential of the co-living business post COVID-19. However, at present there is no clarity about when the new session will start in colleges and universities because of the lockdown, he added. Education is important. As and when situations normalise, students will come back to study, he said. Earlier this year, Stanza Living decided to diversify its business and provide rental accommodations for working professionals as well.  Asked about expansion plans, Dutta said We are not deferring our expansion plans. We are targeting to add 50,000 beds in 12-18 months. Around half of the capacity addition would be for student housing and the remaining for working professionals. On planned investment for expansion, Dutta said the company will be investing around Rs 400 crore over the next two years. We have enough capital for our growth plan. We do not need to raise fresh funds, he added. In a recent study, News Corp and Softbank-backed realty portal PropTiger termed the co-living space as real estate goldmine and said the segment has the potential to become a USD 93 billion market annually on rising demand from students and professionals.

In a conversation with European Commissioner Thierry Breton this week, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg described tech as having a choice between embracing regulatory frameworks coming out of Western democracies or those coming out of countries like China, which allow for more state interference and put less focus on human rights. He name checked the GDPR as an example of regulation having a positive influence on the rest of the world.
 But a central tenet of the GDPR is empowering people to challenge and complain when they feel their rights are being impinged on. No matter how much a company extends GDPR policies to users in other countries, it won't give those users the same recourse afforded to Europeans if their countries don't also have the ability to investigate complaints, enforce sanctions and ultimately hold those collecting and processing data to account.
 But there's good reason for them to use it as a blueprint, as California did in its privacy law. In spite of the seemingly slow progress and the struggles regulators have been facing in enforcing the legislation, there's one thing everyone -- companies, governments, regulators and privacy advocates -- seems to agree on: that the baseline legislation is solid and fit for purpose.
 "It is very flexible, and probably as fair as can be for something that has to cover everyone from the big tech companies to a one-man band," said O'Keefe.
 ## In the near and distant future...
 The European Commission is set to release its own report on the progress of the GDPR in June, but it's likely to reiterate the point that's been made from the beginning, which is that progress was always going to be slow and that the law was never designed as a quick fix.
 It's important to remember that privacy in Europe is still in its adolescence, said van der Wolk. It takes years to establish procedures for investigations, enforcement and dealing with the fallout from the appeals process.
 "We haven't seen any courts actually confirm or overturn some of these regulatory decisions, and I fully appreciate that no regulator wants its decision to be overturned, so they are taking their time," he said. "But really, for me, that is the next step in the maturing process."
 For those eager to see some serious action on Big Tech, the wait could soon be over, as the DPC gears up to announce its first decision on Twitter, which is likely to be swiftly followed by decisions on WhatsApp and Facebook. Onlookers are hoping that action will amount to more than just another fine. "A meaningful enforcement action would require changes in behavior," said O'Keefe. "That is the power that the DPC and the other regulators have, and that's what we need to be looking for."
 There are also several previously unforeseen factors that could affect how the GDPR story plays out in coming months and years. Brexit is one, COVID-19 another.
 The pandemic is proving to be a particular challenge for regulators, which are struggling to come to a cross-border consensus on how it should apply to coronavirus-related surveillance technologies, such as contact-tracing apps and temperature scanning. Like almost every sector, some regulators have also had to slow down or even hit pause on their day-to-day work -- the UK's ICO, for example, isn't accepting new complaints.
 Data protection regulations have been around a lot longer than the GDPR, and at no point have they been taken seriously as a threat. The arrival of the GDPR has, at the very least, shifted that threat up a notch, enabling serious sanctions against those who violate people's right to privacy. At best, it could be a gold-standard piece of legislation that will inspire change in the tech industry for years to come.

In Dutch times more than a century and a half later, archival records suggest there was a hospital within the Dutch fort, catering to patients on the basis of the posts they held in the Dutch East India Company. This was not open to the general public though as the Dutch wanted to keep it strictly for business purposes. There are records of a Mohammedan sailor who was admitted but no one outside of the VOC. Archival records and later English writers suggest that this hospital existed somewhere near the Dutch cemetery towards the south- western side of the fort. But when the British took over they blew up almost all the stately buildings in the fort and the hospital was collateral damage.

Sul fronte dei metodi di riduzione del debito pubblico dal lato dello stock, la disponibilita di un patrimonio pubblico destinabile alla vendita, seppur parziale, rappresenta in Italia una fonte di risorse stimabile in 100 miliardi. Tuttavia, non e semplice portare sul mercato immobiliare strutture pubbliche generalmente utilizzate per scopi, ad esempio, amministrativi. Piu agevole l'utilizzo degli immobili quali collaterale per operazioni di finanziamento a tassi ridotti. Dallo scoppio della pandemia si e parlato molto di sostegno europeo tramite mutualizzazione e trasferimenti. Seppur in linea teorica si tratti di un'ipotesi ragionevole per un'Unione Monetaria che mira a diventare una compiuta Unione Fiscale, l'attuabilita da un punto di vista politico appare complessa, se non entro criteri e limiti prefissati. Pensare ad una riduzione diretta dello stock di debito attualmente esistente in Italia e irrealistico. Ipotizzare l'emissione di nuovo debito comune con l'obiettivo di sostenere i Paesi in difficolta e invece un'ipotesi realistica e praticabile, come suggerito dall'accordo preliminare sul Recovery Fund, le cui fonti di finanziamento sono in corso di definizione ma che saranno probabilmente di origine comune. L'idea che in prospettiva ci possa essere in ogni caso una quota di debito nazionale e una quota di debito comune appare giustificata anche dalla necessita di operare veri e propri trasferimenti da Paesi con maggiori risorse e Paesi con minori capacita di spesa. Non si tratterebbe di una cancellazione di debito italiano ma della possibilita di sostituire parte delle risorse nazionali con risorse europee.

Sisters Crystal Mills and Keasa Bonds will be seeing a lot of each other as they were each hired to fill coaching vacancies at Elysian Fields.
 Bonds will be the new head volleyball coach for the Lady Jackets while Mills will be the head girls basketball coach.
 “I’m head volleyball coach and she’s going to be my assistant, and she’s head basketball and I’m her assistant, it’s very surreal,” Bonds said. “I wouldn’t have it any other way. I’m really excited. It doesn’t get better than that. Our kids will be going to the same school next year so we’ll probably be carpooling to work every now and then.”
 Bonds was hired first and when the girls basketball coaching job opened up, she recommended Mills.
 “She (Bonds) said, ‘Hey, you should interview my sister and at first I was hesitant but she really blew it away,” Elysian Fields athletic director Scott Ford said. “We were really impressed with her.”
 “It’s really funny,” Mills recalls. “I was just scrolling and saw that the head basketball job was open. I was working in Tyler ISD and I was like, ‘I’m going to apply for it,’ because I had been coaching for 10 years and I had three years of head coaching experience, two years at Gladewater and one year at Daingerfield. I was like, ‘I’m ready to get back to head coaching. I’m going to apply for it.’ So she gave me coach Ford’s contact information and I contacted him for an interview and the rest is history. I’m really excited. I’m ready to get to work.”
 The sisters are East Texas natives. Mills graduated from Kilgore High School in 2003. While there, she lettered in basketball for three years and became a team captain of a team that finished as district champs her senior year. From there she went on to play at Kilgore College, Southern Arkansas and University of Texas of the Permian Basin. She got her first coaching job in 2010 and has gained experience as both an assistant coach and a head coach at different stops.
 Bonds graduated from Longview High School in 2007 before attending Cisco Junior College, then LeTourneau where she continued her volleyball career. She coached club volleyball in 2009 before landing a job as a volleyball coach at Foster Middle School. She coached this past season at Carlisle where she led her team to the first round of the playoffs.
 Both sisters say they have high expectations for their squads.
 “I expect us to continue to make the playoffs,” Bonds said. “Elysian Fields is known for always having athletes. I’m so excited about that. They have records for making the playoffs in both sports. We’re really looking forward to our goals, expectations and what we want to do, which is to make the playoffs and see how far we go.”
 “My expectation is to continue the tradition,” Mills offered. “I know they have a very high tradition with their basketball program. They’re always making the playoffs and I want to continue that tradition, the winning tradition. I’m going to give all my effort to push every athlete and try to build something to where we can go far into the playoffs. That’s what my long term goal is. I want to get to that state tournament. It’s going to take a lot of hard work and dedication but I believe I’ve got a good group of girls who will help me get to that long-term goal.”
 As high as their expectations are for on the court, they’re even higher for in the classroom.
 “Academics are first,” Mills said. “You’ve got to be a student first. Athlete is second. It’s called, ‘student athlete’ so I push academics. We have study hall one day out of the week. I stay on top of grades. I do grade checks every other week. I push academics because you can’t get a scholarship in athletics if you don’t get it in academics. That’s what I push.”
 “School comes first,” Bonds said, echoing her sister’s sentiments. “I’m a big believer in that education is everything. Once you get your diploma, nobody can take that away. Once you go to college and you earn a degree, you’re always going to have that degree, that piece of paper that you worked hard for. You can say, ‘I earned this. I did this on my own.’ For most schools, even if you get an athletic scholarship, they’ll go look at your grades and look at things other than athletics.”
 Overall, the sisters say they’re excited to get to work, and doing it together as they expect big things in the near future, not just for themselves but their Lady Jackets.

FCC commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel said that the FCC should hold a series of public hearings and reach out to broadcasters in the top 30 markets in order to make sure its incentive auction process is as transparent as possible and that outreach is targeted to where the mobile broadband need is greatest.
 That came in comments on the FCC's status report on those auctions at its public meeting Thursday. She also reiterated her desire that the FCC produce a band plan by the end of the third quarter. While the FCC wants a variable band plan in which stations and wireless companies could be using the same or adjacent channels in different markets, broadcasters have called for more separation to prevent potential interference.
 "We are grateful to commissioner Rosenworcel for her suggestion of public hearings to address issues such as how initial prices for broadcasters will be established and how the forward and reverse auctions will relate to each other," said Preston Padden, executive director, Expanding Opportunities for Broadcasters Coalition, following the presentation.

I have heard Gov. Walz complain that the Trump Administration should be setting a national strategy for reopening and that since the administration has not, Minnesota must chart its own way. I believe this is a gross misinterpretation. Yes, Minnesota must chart its own way, but that is the way it should be. We are a constitutional republic and our constitution is clear on the enumeration of powers. President Trump and his administration have taken a constitutionally sound approach to allow each state to determine the best course for its citizens.
 The CDC and other administration officials have released guidelines to help states make these determinations. As we have learned more about how COVID-19 spreads and its effects on certain demographic groups -- people with pre- existing conditions such as diabetes, heart disease and obesity -- those guidelines have changed. The guidelines have followed the science, which is what Walz says he does with such conviction on any and every issue.
 Minnesota had an opportunity to follow the science and lead the nation. Instead Gov. Walz and his advisors chose a different path -- one that has brought us a haphazard reopening that is creating confusion, frustration, and anger.
 Our state is not completely lost, but we need Gov. Walz to lead. We need a coherent strategy that gives every Minnesotan a clear understanding of when they can open their business and when they can go back to work. Employees and employers in every sector of our economy need guidance and protections to figure out how best to resume their operations. And the governor must recognize that what may be necessary for the Twin Cities may not be needed in greater Minnesota.
 Above all else and as we approach June 1, I hope Gov. Walz will realize that -- given the opportunity -- Minnesotans can and should be trusted to do the right thing.

Senate Commerce Committee chairman Jay Rockefeller (D-W.Va.)   plans to concentrate on expanding the FCC's E-Rate program when he questions   Tom Wheeler at his nomination hearing for FCC chairman on Tuesday, according to   a commerce committee aide on background.
 E-Rate,   which Rockefeller helped create, is the FCC mandate to provide affordable   access to cutting edge telecommunications service to schools and libraries (),   with that subsidy coming out of the Universal Service Fund.
 PresidentObama announced a ConnectED initiative two weeks ago with a goal of getting   the FCC to "leverage and modernize" the E-Rate program and to connect   99% of students to high-speed wired and wireless broadband (speeds of no less   than 100 Mbps and preferably 1 Gbps) within five years.
 "Updating the E-Rate program is critical to helping   students become competitive in the global economy," said Rockefeller in a   statement to the press. "Particularly in our rural and urban communities,   we have a moral obligation to give our young ones the tools to succeed."
 Rockefeller also will suggest that the FCC needs to be a   more aggressive, consumer-focused agency. Even as Wheeler is being grilled on   E-Rate, Rockefeller's choice for chair, his former telecom aide Jessica   Rosenworcel will be in California speaking about boosting E-Rate, which has   also been one of her key issues.
 In his prepared testimony for the hearing,   Wheeler sounds like he is on the same page when it comes to improving the   E-Rate program. "It doesn't make sense that 80% of E-Rate schools report   the available bandwidth is below their instructional needs," he said.

MOSCOW — Stefan Yauchzee, 41, a longtime Latah County resident and University of Idaho graduate, recently opened Pour Co., a craft beer taproom and retail bottle shop next door to Stax sandwich shop here.
 Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the craft beer bar is only open to curbside delivery and pickup. Patrons can also browse and purchase inside for takeout, said Yauchzee, 41.
 Yauchzee hopes customers will be able to enjoy a beverage or two inside his business in Stage 3 — May 30 at the earliest — of Gov. Brad Little’s Idaho Rebounds plan.
 Pour Co. will offer bar snacks in addition to alcohol when the taproom fully opens, and customers will be allowed to bring their own food inside, Yauchzee said.
 Since area breweries are already selling local brews, Yauchzee said his focus is selling beer that customers will not find anywhere else.
 While he offers some Northwest beer, he said he has beer from the United Kingdom, Germany and the eastern U.S. to name a few. He also has a limited wine selection.
 He receives shipments almost daily from different distributors so his selection always fluctuates and he ensures his menu is updated on his website to reflect those changes, Yauchzee said.
 Owning a business is a first for Yauchzee who came to the Palouse in 1999 as a University of Idaho student. He graduated in 2003 and decided to stick around.
 He lived in Troy for a time but moved back to Moscow about seven years ago. He managed Potting Shed Creations in Troy before starting Pour Co. His wife, Kim Yauchzee, works at Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories.
 “It’s kind of been a dream the last five years to do something like this,” Yauchzee said.
 The location, which is right off the eastern edge of the UI campus, is great because it is close to downtown, receives a lot of pedestrian traffic and food establishments are nearby for those who want to eat and grab a beer or two at his business, he said.
 Customers can visit www.pourcompanymoscow.com to order and pick up their beverages curbside or inside the establishment at 402 W. Sixth St., No. 102, Yauchzee said. Customers can call or text (208) 596-4517 to arrange pickup.
 Business hours are 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sunday through Thursday and 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Friday and Saturday. Once it is open to inside seating, hours will be 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. Sunday through Thursday and 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. Friday and Saturday.
 “We just can’t wait to be (fully) up and running eventually and meet everybody,” Yauchzee said.

House Energy & Commerce Committee leaders Thursday   registered their continuing concern over the EAGLE-Net broadband stimulus grant   with the National Telecommunications & Information Administration, which   handed out the subsidy and oversees its progress.
 In   the letter to NTIA chief Larry Strickling, Communications Subcommittee   chair Greg Walden (R-Ore.) and Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee chairman   Tim Murphy (R-Pa.) point out that the committee is still investigating   allegations -- including by cable operators -- thatthe $100.6 million subsidy is being used to overbuild existing service,   rather than extending it to unserved parts of Colorado.
 "[T]hose areas of Colorado which truly lack high-speed   broadband connectivity -- such as the communities along the Western Slope --   are still waiting for the promised EAGLE-Net service to be turned on,"   they wrote. "We remain skeptical of that occurring on time and on budget   in light of a February 28, 2013 report indicating that $96 million of the   $100.6 million grant has already been committed or spent. Even more troubling   to the Committee is EAGLE-Net's recent acknowledgement that only $7.8 million   of the original grant money remains despite reports that the project is less   than half complete."
 They want a raft of documents related to NTIA's review and   for NTIA to answer several questions:
                                                                                               1. How did it verify data regarding served and unserved populations   in the project area?
                                                                                               2. How did building fiber optic connections to the Cherry Creek School District satisfy   eligibility requirements?

How did the network design change?                                                                                               4. Does the project, which is funded by the Broadcast Technology Opportunities   Program, overlap with the USDA's RUS middle mile awards?
                                                                                               5. What are the current revenues and expenses of the project?                                                                                               6. Why was the project placed on a "corrective action" plan and what   corrections have been made?
 They gave Strickling until July 8 to produce the documents   and the answers.
 EAGLE-Net has said that the grant has rules to   help it avoid overbuilding, but also says that its grant satisfies a need for   access and "redundancy," and points to the fact that its grant is for   a statewide system.
 "EAGLE-Net is continuing to work with the NTIA and OIG to provide requested information," EAGLE-Net President Mike Ryan told B&C.

Regulators also have the power to stop companies either temporarily or permanently from collecting and processing data. This has the potential to completely disrupt their business models and force them to make major changes to their core products.
 "If they could prove that it's proportionate to impose a restriction on processing of a big tech company, then you could imagine the shockwaves that would send," said Walshe.
 We've gotten our first glimpse of this already. Facebook was mere days away from rolling out its Facebook Dating in Europe on Feb. 13 when regulators stepped in and told the company to put the launch on ice. According to the DPC, it's awaiting a response to questions it submitted to Facebook following a review of the company's documentation. Facebook didn't respond to a request for comment.
 For Ryan, the biggest threat to tech companies lies within Article 5 of the GDPR, which stipulates that companies may not use data for anything other than the purpose for which it was originally collected.
 "Big Tech has a habit of having what I refer to as an internal data free-for- all," said Ryan. "With things like purpose limitation, if they are enforced, Big Tech changes overnight. There will be appeals and there'll be court cases, but the blood will be in the water."
 ## International impact
 Whether these powers are used and the sanctions stick could have a knock-on effect on Europe's reputation in the global arena, according to Ryan.
 Europe doesn't boast Big Tech superpowers like China and the US, but what it does have right now is "regulatory influence," with the GDPR as one of the shining jewels in its crown. If the law doesn't stand up, Europe's influence could take a major hit, Ryan said.
 But the GDPR also has unlikely and powerful allies among some of the very entities it's designed to regulate. The one thing American tech giants fear more than regulation is regulation coming out of China, which might explain their increasingly public embrace of privacy standards designed at home or cooked up by close allies of the US.

Sul fronte del costo del debito, invece, l'elevato livello degli impegni finanziari dello Stato italiano impone la necessita di tenere i tassi di finanziamento a un livello molto contenuto per evitare lo "snowball effect", cioe quel meccanismo di progressivo aumento del debito dovuto a tassi d'interesse elevati, per una data crescita nominale del pil. Il contenimento del costo del debito dipende primariamente dalla "capacita e volonta" di pagare da parte del debitore e dunque dall'impegno dello Stato italiano di far fronte ai pagamenti anche attraverso l'annuncio di una traiettoria di rientro da deficit particolarmente elevati e insostenibili. Nel caso specifico dell'area euro e della situazione attuale, il contenimento del costo del debito e garantito dall'azione della Bce che, tramite i programmi di acquisto di titoli di Stato (Public Sector Purchase Programme, PSPP e Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme, PEPP), calmiera i tassi dei titoli italiani, al fine di garantire una corretta trasmissione dello stimolo monetario. Tale effetto favorevole, non necessariamente permanente, non dovrebbe esimere dal preservare credibilita e reputazione nell'onorare gli impegni finanziari.

There was movement on the FCC nominee front last week. Senate Commerce Committee chairman Jay Rockefeller (D-W. Va.) scheduled a June 18 hearing on the nomination of Tom Wheeler as FCC chairman, and a highly placed source confirmed Republicans had interviewed Fred Campbell for the seat of former commissioner Robert McDowell.      Campbell, director of the Competitive Enterprise Institute’s Communications Liberty & Innovation Project, declined comment. But a source said that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.)’s staff spoke with Campbell about the post.      McConnell is said to have wanted to extend the search to include academics and think-tank officials, and Campbell would fit the bill. A veteran communications attorney, Campbell was a wireless advisor to FCC chairman Kevin Martin, chief of the wireless bureau and a legal adviser on auction policies, arguably the FCC’s central issue as it preps for a second spectrum incentive auction. He is also a former president of the Wireless Communications Association International (WCAI). Wheeler, President Obama’s choice to succeed FCC chief Julius Genachowski, is also a former wireless trade group chief (CTIA) so they could certainly compare notes if both make the cut.

David Hill, News Corp.'s senior executive VP, has been tapped to oversee both _American Idol_ and _The X Factor_ while Fox searches for a permanent replacement for reality chief Mike Darnell, the network confirmed.
 Last month Darnell announced his intentions to step down at the end of his current contract, which is up after this month.
 Hill is known better for his work with Fox Sports -- he was CEO of the division from 1999 until last summer. He is also leading the launch efforts of the upcoming Fox Sports 1 cable network, which debuts in August. Hill's experience in negotiating sports rights deals and handling major live events were likely factors in being chosen.
 Following Darnell's departure, Fox will move to a more traditional network/producer relationship with their two high-profile properties, with Hill serving as the network's point person for the producers. Darnell's replacement will focus on development when hired.
  _American Idol_ , after seeing ratings fall double-digits this season, is currently undergoing another revamp at its judges table, with Randy Jackson, Mariah Carey and Nicki Minaj all departing; Keith Urban's status is up in the air. Executive producers Nigel Lythgoe and Ken Warwick have also been reported to be out as well.
  _The X Factor_ , whose ratings have not lived up to its grandiose expectations, will also see two new judges in Kelly Rowland and Paulina Rubio.

Crackle, Sony Pictures Entertainment's online video   entertainment network, said it signed auto brand Acura as sole sponsor of _Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee_ , the   Web series created by and starring Jerry Seinfeld.
 Acura will sponsor 24 new episodes of the show during 2013   and 2014. Acura products, including the new Acura MDX, will be integrated into   the series.
 The deal follows the digital media NewFronts, in which   online video platforms including Crackle, presented their shows to media buyers   the same way TV networks do in a bid to capture a larger share of ad spending.
 "Crackle is a big priority at SPE and the studio has   had a long, successful relationship with Jerry, so _Comedians in Cars_ is very important to us," Eric Berger,   executive VP of digital networks for Sony Pictures Television and general   manager of Crackle. "It's a great fit to have Acura on board and through   our exclusive partnership, we will be working closely to engage millions of   fans around the fun, simple pleasures of driving."
 Seinfeld worked with Acura on a commercial that aired during   the 2013 Super Bowl.
 "We love Jerry's unconventional, fan-first approach of   creating great content and trusting that the right people will find it,"   said Mike Accavitti, Acura senior VP of auto operations. "It is totally   consistent with Acura's organic approach of putting the customer first and   building the vehicle around them."
  _Comedian in Cars Getting   Coffee_ has generated more than 10 million streams since it launched in July   2012.
 " _We at Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee_   are so glad a company we already admire has stepped forward to support   us," Seinfeld in a statement. "Not everyone understood what we   were doing. But like Moe Green who invented Las Vegas, Acura is a company   of vision and guts. We could not be more thrilled to have them as our   sponsor. Because of them, we advance!"

On Tuesday, squads started non-contract training for the first time since the Premier League was suspended on March 13\.
 That an increased number of tests has produced fewer positive findings may be a boost to the Premier League's 'Project Restart' plan to resume fixtures in June. Clubs are expected to discuss moving to contact training in Tuesday.
 Officials still plan to complete all 92 remaining fixtures, with Premier League chief executive Richard Masters saying on Friday that they were "as confident as we can be" about restarting in June.
 Several players still have concerns about returning, among them Watford captain Troy Deeney and Chelsea midfielder N'Golo Kante who have stayed away from training this week.
 As well as Mariappa, two members of Watford's staff have tested positive while Hornets manager Nigel Pearson revealed on Friday that several of his players were isolating at home after family members contracted the virus.
 Elsewhere in Europe, Germany's Bundesliga has resumed behind closed doors while on Saturday the Spanish Prime Minister, Pedro Sanchez, announced La Liga could restart in the week of June 8.

The Left front government led by Pinarayi Vijayan can be termed as a Government of disasters. While Ockhi was a natural disaster, the floods of 2018 and the deluge and land-slipping of 2019 were man-made. Failure to open the shutters of dams led to the 2018 floods while the 2019 deluge and land slip was owing to the unabated quarrying taking place at these places. Even after the Covid-19 outbreak, his government is found wanting in several areas and people are running from pillar to post to settle their natural grievances. State government has failed in arranging solace to the people and we have seen the migrant workers coming out in on the streets at Changanssery, Kozhikode and Kannur. The migrant workers entered into a street fight with the police at Pettah,Thiruvananthapuram in which the SHO of police got injured in stone pelting .This shows the total failure on the part of the state government and its Health and Home departments. The state is in the midst of an acute financial crisis and the Finance minister does not have any clue whatsoever on the actual financial position of the state. The government has also failed to extract good deals from the Central government and this is another major failure on the part of the government. In short the government has failed the people in all counts and I can say that this government is a disaster.

Just a few months ago, Cabarrus County’s unemployment rate was at an all-time low. Our citizens were thriving in their jobs and businesses were growing. Today, thanks to a global pandemic that few saw coming, our nation and our local economy are reeling. The unemployment rate now tells a very different story — one that leaves our citizens out of work and concerned about the future. It’s an uncertain time to say the least.
 What people may not realize is that the Cabarrus Economic Development Corp. remains just as busy as ever, continuing to field inquiries from industry- leading corporations that are interested in our area. In fact, many of the new business ventures that began before COVID-19 never stalled and are continuing, while additional opportunities are also being added to the pipeline every day.
 On April 14, in the midst of social distancing and widespread business closures, the Cabarrus EDC announced that one of the world’s leading residential cabinetmakers, GoldenHome International, will be locating its North American headquarters in Concord. This new addition to The Grounds at Concord will supply 257 jobs, with an average salary of $42,593 per year over the course of the next five years. Thanks to a year’s worth of hard work and dedication to the improvement of our community, high-quality jobs are coming to Cabarrus County at a time when we need them most. Better yet, this announcement was just one of several made in recent months — all of which come with the guarantee of ready-to-fill, full-time jobs, benefits included.
 “Regarding new business activity over the past eight weeks, activity is still very strong,” says Samantha Grass, recruitment project manager. “We were able to announce GoldenHome International in April and are actively working with three companies that will be making a location decision in the coming weeks. There are three additional projects as well that are very active that we are assisting on a weekly basis as they evaluate possible locations in Cabarrus County. Those projects were, of course, in the pipeline before the COVID-19 pandemic began in the U.S.”

The Catholic Church has thus created an unnatural system, which is, ironically, kinder to nuns and cruel to priests. Kinder to nuns because, their relationship to Jesus makes gender-sense; whereas the relationship of male priests as ‘brides’ to Jesus is unnatural on the face of it. Understandably, therefore, it is easier for nuns to keep faith and stay steadfast with their vow of celibacy. It is infinitely more difficult, and emotionally impossible, for most male priests to do so.

In a rare instance, the Gujarat High Court brought up a real-life incidence - the foundering of Titanic ship in April 1912 - to stress upon the need for the governments and society to collectively respond to the distress amid the prevailing global pandemic of Covid-19.
 Passing the judgement in its suo-moto petition against the Gujarat government on Friday, the High Court, citing the Titanic example, underscored the need for an unshaken determination to help "most vulnerable" in the "unprecedented times of chaos, uncertainty and extreme stress." There could be numerous excuses to run away from the responsibility to help a neighbour. "But whoever can find it in their hearts to rise above all these frivolous excuses will always be remembered fondly in history," the bench of Justices JB Pardiwala and Ilesh J Vora said in their order.
 They maintained that the tragic saga of the Titanic taught us that our fate is uncertain, governed by the powerful forces of nature. "The crashing of the Titanic was inevitable, but evitable was the loss of the human lives. It is believed that if the other two ships had responded in time, all people on board the Titanic could have been saved. We face a similar tragedy today, in the form of a global pandemic caused by a contagious virus we barely have any power over. What we do have power over is ourselves," the bench said.
 The comments from the Court came at a time, when the Gujarat government is facing flack from all corners of the society for its handling of the Covid-19 outbreak. The State has seen sharp surge in cases with highest mortality rate in the country.
 As on Saturday, Gujarat has reported total 13,669 Covid-19 cases of which 6,671 are active and 829 deaths. Ahmedabad city alone has 70 per cent of the State's total cases. City's Civil Hospital has earned a dubious distinction of being a 'graveyard' for Covid patients with 377 deaths (about half of State total) happening in this State-run hospital.
 The court termed it "as good as dungeon. May be even worst then a dungeon" for "extremely bad" state of affairs at one of the largest public hospitals in the country. Referring to State Health Minister, who is also the deputy chief minister, Nitin Patel and Health Secretary Jayanti Ravi, the High Court desired to know how many times did they visit the Civil Hospital for keeping a watch, to interact or take stock of the situation on ground? "Whether they have any idea about the problems faced by patients, doctors, nursing staff and other employees? Is the State Government aware of the hard fact that the patients at the Civil Hospital are dying because of lack of adequate number of ventilators?" the High Court raised serious questions about the seriousness of State administration in tackling the pandemic.
 While government hospitals fared poor in performance, the court asked the private and corporate hospitals to admit Covid-19 patients and refrain from profiteering in the times of crisis. "The foremost reason for their (private hospitals') existence is to treat sick patients and it would be utterly shameful on their part to shy away from this responsibility at this point in time, when the country and its people need them the most. Profiting off a poor man’s health can be considered morally criminal," the court said.
 It stated that if the private hospitals continue to have this indignant and apathetic attitude in this time of crisis then lives which could have been easily saved will be lost. In times of a crisis human lives outweigh everything, especially money, it said.
 "As the situation in Gujarat escalates, it is time for the private hospitals to step into perform their primary function of savings lives. At least in times like these when men and women and children are dying alone, we expect the private hospitals to be the giver of life and not the harbinger of death," the bench said passing an order to the State government to initiate appropriate legal proceedings against all those private / corporate hospitals who are not willing to treat Covid-19 patients.
 It was noticed that 23 private hospitals had inked memoranda of understanding (MoU) with the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) to treat Covid-19 patients, but several corporate hospitals such as Apollo Hospital at two locations, Zydus Hospital, KD Hospital, Asia Columbia, Global Hospital, UN Mehta Hospital remained out of the list. The High Court asked the State to initiate talks with these hospitals for providing treatment to Covid-19 patients.
 There were also, allegations on the government for capping the tests, for which the State representative had argued before the court saying that "more tests may lead to 70 per cent of the population testing positive for Covid, thereby leading to fear psychosis" in the public. The High Court dismissed this argument saying, it "should not be a ground to refuse or restrict the testing" and suggested the government to make wide publicity and awareness to bust the fear and make the people alert and issued several directions for better facilities for Covid-19 patients.
 While acknowledging the good work done by on-ground administrators, corona warriors like healthcare workers, police, volunteers, philanthropists, the bench lauded the "commendable" work by senior IAS Dr Rajiv Gupta and his team, AMC Commissioner Mukesh Kumar and Gujarat State Road Transport Corporation chief S J Haider for on ground operations.
 "What we require most in times like these is resilient leadership...In times like these, the emotional intelligence is critical... In this mentally disturbing time of isolation and social distancing, it is the encouraging and motivating messages of their leaders that can keep morale high behind closed doors," the bench said adding that using emotional intelligence strategically, we can skillfully prepare our people for the worse scenarios without having them lose heart.
 "It is essential that the leaders realise that it is only them, who hold a position of authority and have built a place of trust in the hearts of the people. Hence, it is only them who need to come forward and adequately deal with the complex anxieties of people and provide them with a sense of physiological security."
 Using the Titanic metaphor, the bench stated that when it was sinking on April 15, 1912, there were three ships close-by. Of these ships, only one -The Carpathia - from the farthest location responded, rushed for help and saved 705 lives from freezing to death in the water.
 "It is believed that if the other two ships (which were nearer) had responded in time, all people on board Titanic could have been saved. We face a similar tragedy today, in the form of a global pandemic caused by a contagious virus we barely have any power over. What we do have power over is ourselves." "We all should become the “Carpathia”.

From pitches to plants. From hardballs to hibiscus. From the strike zone to the root zone. Those phrases are a way of describing the transition made by a Major League Baseball player who, with his daughter, has developed one of the leading plant nurseries in the nation.
 Lyndsi Oestman is vice president of Loma Vista Nursery in Ottawa, Kansas. She shared this remarkable story.
 Lyndsi’s dad, Mark Clear, grew up in California where he worked at his best friend’s family’s avocado ranch. Mark enjoyed tree pruning and avocado picking. He also enjoyed baseball. In fact, he was such a good player that he was drafted into Major League Baseball as a pitcher.
 While being developed in the minor leagues, he was playing in Des Moines when he met the young woman who would become his wife. He went on to a 17-year major-league career, serving as a two-time all-star relief pitcher for the California Angels, Boston Red Sox and Milwaukee Brewers.
 One year, Mark bought a tree nursery in California with his childhood friend from the avocado ranch. He played baseball during the season and worked at the nursery during the offseason.
 One of his buddies on the Red Sox was traded to the Kansas City Royals. When Mark came for a visit, he found he loved the hunting and fishing in the KC area. In fact, he liked it so well that he moved his family to Olathe after retiring from baseball. He also sold his share of the partnership in California and bought a home with a tree nursery in Olathe. He called it Loma Vista Nursery.
 “That was the place I grew up in,” Lyndsi said. “My brother and I drove tractors and planted trees.” The company became one of the first wholesale suppliers in the Kansas City area.
 Lyndsi went to Kansas State University and studied marketing and business. She met and married her husband and entered corporate work after graduation, but found it wasn’t the same as a family business.
 As Loma Vista Nursery continued to grow and evolve, Lyndsi came back to work at the nursery. She worked in every department and became vice president of the company, which is now headquartered in Ottawa, Kansas.
 Today, Loma Vista Nursery is one of the nation’s leading wholesale suppliers of plants, trees and shrubs for independent garden centers, landscape contractors, and wholesale distributors in the Midwest. The operation consists of 300 acres of containerized production at Ottawa plus a 600-acre tree farm in the Willow Springs area of Douglas County. Willow Springs is a rural township with a population of 1,409 people. Now, that’s rural.
 Loma Vista Nursery offers various varieties of pot-in-pot trees, shrubs, roses, grasses, perennials and groundcovers. The tree farm produces field- grown shade and ornamental trees, upright junipers and spruce, as well as many other deciduous and evergreen varieties. Loma Vista serves customers from Denver to Indianapolis.
 “We’re focused on being the best grower we can be,” Lyndsi said. Loma Vista was a pioneer in the adoption of what is called SANC: Systems Approach to Nursery Certification, developed in partnership with regulatory agencies and the industry. In simplest terms, SANC takes a holistic approach to the processes and protocols necessary to assure plant health. “We are super proud of that,” Lyndsi said. “Our SANC handbook has become one of the national models.”
 In 2019, Loma Vista Nursery won the national sustainability award from Greenhouse Grower magazine. “We want to do the right thing for our plants, our people, and our customers,” Lyndsi said.
 Loma Vista employs 100 people and is home to more than 1 million propagated plants and more than 2 million containerized plants. “The team we have right now is awesome, and we’re very proud to be part of the Ottawa community,” Lyndsi said.
 For more information, see www.lomavistanursery.com.
 From baseball fields to fields of plants, Mark Clear successfully made the adjustment. We commend Mark Clear, Lyndsi Oestman, and all the people of Loma Vista Nursery for making a difference with commitment, horticultural knowledge, and entrepreneurship. They’ve gone from major league to major landscape.

New York -- CBS Sports chairman Sean McManus expects the   launch of Fox Sports 1 in August to make a lot of noise, but he's not changing   the strategy of his cable competitor CBS Sports Network in light of the   crowding field, he told attendees at Wednesday's Sports Business and Technology   Summit presented by _B &C, Multichannel News_ and _TV Technology_.     
 "There are a lot of competitors in this space," McManus   said in a keynote moderated by _B &C_ deputy editor Michael Malone. "It   may very well be that in the future -- and we've done this with Turner -- that   we do deals in the future with NBC Sports Network or NBC or Fox Sports 1. We're   not directly responding to what they're doing by changing our altering our   strategy at the sports network right now."     
 Unlike NBC and Fox, who are investing hundreds of millions   of dollars in sports rights, CBS Sports Network has taken a different tack,   opting to pick up smaller properties like major league lacrosse and   Professional Bull Riders and hiring talent like Jim Rome and Doug Gottlieb to   helm studio shows.     
 "We are trying to build our network more slowly and   more strategically. We're not in a position right now in our corporation and we   don't want to invest that much money," McManus said. "At some point   we'll be in a position to compete for the highest-level rights, but right now   we have a different philosophy."     
 So far, the network has grown from 22 million households to   50 million in three years under the helm of David Berson, who earlierthis month was promoted to president of CBS Sports. McManus initially hired   the former ESPN executive in 2011 with the intention of grooming him for the   top job.     
 "As much as I love my job, succession planning at CBS   is very important," McManus said. "He will slowly assume more of the   day-to-day responsibilities, but I'm not going anywhere for a while."     
 And while NBC outbid Fox and ESPN for a $250-million,   three-year deal to broadcast the English Premier League, McManus praised the   sports ascendency that while not capable of rivaling the NFL or college   football, has grown into an important niche TV property.     
 "It has passionate fans. Soccer is not, in   my opinion, going to be mainstream, every single week on network television,   but it has a big impact on cable television and the big events like the World   Cup can have a big event on network television," he said. "It has   grown by leaps and bounds in terms of its value when you're building a cable   network."

The goal is to keep the family out of sight, because bearing witness to a shooting could put them at a different kind of risk, mom Kianna Hicks says.
 So when trouble erupts, they do their best to remain unseen and unheard.
 "We turn the TV down," says 13-year-old Anajah Hicks, the oldest of four. "We turn the lights off, and we hurry up and get down on the ground."
 A few times each month, the family practices what to do when they hear gunshots. Hicks tells the kids to get ready. Then, their grandmother Gloria Hicks claps her hands to simulate the sound of gunfire.
 "I need them to know exactly what to do, because in too many instances, where we've been sitting around, and gunshots, you know, people start shooting, and they'll just be up walking around or trying to run," Kianna Hicks says. "I'll tell 'em, 'Naw, that's not what you do. You hear gunshots, you hear gunshots. No matter where you at, you stop — you get on the ground and you wait until it's over with and then you move around.' "

Madrid, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 24th May, 2020 ) :Spanish media rejoiced on Sunday after the government said La Liga could resume, but restarting in June presents many challenges including summer heat, empty stadiums and health rules.
 Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez announced on Saturday that football could return from its coronavirus lockdown in the week of June 8\.
 After closely observing as Bundesliga players acted as lab rats when their league became the first of the major European competitions to return last weekend, Spain, hard hit by the pandemic, will now take its turn.
 La Liga has not yet specified when it will kick off or detailed the health protocols it will adopt, but is expected to do so within the next week, according to the Spanish press.
 "La Liga is back," exclaimed the front page of Spain's best-selling daily Marca, which adorned its front page with a heart formed by the badges of the 20 Liga clubs. Madrid rival AS and Catalan newspaper Sport used the same headline.
 Liga president Javier Tebas has been pushing for the league to resume on June 12, with the Seville derby between Real Betis and Sevilla as the curtain- raiser.
 Tebas said on Saturday that he was "very happy" with the announcement, but added "We can't let our guard down".
 The last 11 rounds of the season will be played behind closed doors at a time when most of the country can expect scorching heat.
 At a meeting with La Liga over the weekend, the Spanish Football Players' Association (AFE), called for cooling breaks during games when temperatures are between 28 and 32 degrees Celsius (82 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit), and for training and matches to be postponed when temperatures rise above 32 degrees, which is common in the height of summer in much of Spain.
 Temperatures during training in Valencia on Saturday reached 28 degrees.

La Liga has eagerly announced there would be "football every day" of the week, but the AFE has demanded that clubs be allowed a compulsory gap of at least 72 hours between matches and the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) had already started a legal action to prevent that.
 RFEF went to court at the start of the season and blocked La Liga, which wanted to maximise broadcast revenues, scheduling games on Monday. A final judgement is yet to be handed down.
 \- 'Weird times' - Tebas estimated at the beginning of April that if La Liga did not resume broadcasting the losses would amount to a billion Euros ($1.09 billion), compared with 300 million euros if it played without spectators.
 Between now and the restart, the players, who switched from individual training to small group sessions on 18 May while continuing to observe strict health measures, will have almost three weeks to prepare.
 The AFE demanded the players were given at least 15 to 20 days to get match fit.
 "We want to return to the competition, but we have to go step by step to get back into shape," Levante winger and captain Jose Luis Morales told Marca on Saturday. "We won't have any games to test our fitness, we'll go straight into the competition." The sentiment was echoed by Espanyol central defender Bernardo Espinosa.
 "What we're most concerned about is what can happen physically, injuries," the Colombian told his club's website on Friday. "These two months have increased the risk of injury.""That's what my team-mates are worried about the most. We need to regain muscle tone and function and reduce the risk, which has increased, not just because of the time we've been out of the game, but also because of the weird times we've been going through and the high temperatures."

Police, good souls, suspect no foul play; but people, forever keen to smell a rat, think it’s a case of suicide. In September 2018, a 54-year-old nun, Susan Mathew, was found dead in a convent well in Kollam district. She used to work as a teacher in St Stephen’s School, Pathanapuram. In December 2015, a 33-year-old nun, Stella Maria, was found dead in the well of Sacred Heart convent near Vagamon in Idukki. Several other instances can be cited, commencing from the tragic case of Sister Abhaya, who was found dead in St Pius X Convent in Kottayam on 27 March 1992.

So, if nuns are committing suicide –as we are told they are- canon law is the villain of the piece. It is a pity that conditions tantamount to slavery, and the desperation it breeds, are being allowed to survive and prevail in this day and age just because they exist in the garb of religion. It is futile to expect any willingness, much less initiative, to be forthcoming from the church hierarchy to reform these anti-human, brutally forbidding provisions that militate against the provisions of the Indian Constitution. It is the duty of the Catholic laity and believers at large, for the sake of Jesus Christ who came to ‘set the captives free’, to ensure that modern-day slavery is not perpetuated in his name.

Clubs are expected to discuss moving to contact training on Tuesday.
 Officials still plan to complete all 92 remaining fixtures, with Premier League chief executive Richard Masters saying on Friday that they were "as confident as we can be" about restarting next month.
 Several players still have concerns about returning, among them Watford captain Troy Deeney and Chelsea midfielder N'Golo Kante, who stayed away from training this week.
 As well as Mariappa, two members of Watford's staff have tested positive, while Hornets manager Nigel Pearson revealed on Friday that several of his players were isolating at home after family members contracted the virus.
 Meanwhile, the English Football League announced Sunday that two unnamed individuals at the same Championship club had produced positive results after conducting tests on 1,014 players and staff at all 24 Championship clubs over the past 72 hours.
 As with the Premier League, the small number of positive tests will encourage those who want to see the Championship season resume next month.
 Elsewhere in Europe, Germany's Bundesliga has resumed behind closed doors while on Saturday the Spanish Prime Minister, Pedro Sanchez, announced La Liga could restart in the week of June 8.

Mozilla's Firefox has joined Microsoft Explorer in making "Do Not Track" the default setting on its browser and will block cookies unless a user wants them, according to various reports, which drew praise from one top legislator.
 Mozilla already supported a voluntary icon-based "Do Not Track" initiative from the Digital Advertising Alliance, but the latest move takes it to another level, one digital advertisers don't like but is favored by some legislators, including Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-W. Va.), chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee.
 "This is welcome news from Mozilla," Rockefeller said in a statement. "It proves there's a market for giving consumers strong privacy protections, and demonstrates that developers are eager to do this when online advertisers fall short.
 "With two major Web browsers now blocking third-party cookies by default, it's even more important to give businesses the regulatory certainty they need and consumers the privacy protections they deserve. I hope this will end the emerging back and forth so we can act quickly to pass new legislation."
 In March, Rockefeller reintroduced legislation that would require companies that collect personal information online to get the affirmative permission of the person whose information is being collected.

Paris, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 24th May, 2020 ) :The novel coronavirus has killed at least 342,295 people since the outbreak first emerged in China last December, according to a tally from official sources compiled by AFP at 1100 GMT on Sunday.
 At least 5,327,680 cases of coronavirus have been registered in 196 countries and territories. Of these, at least 2,066,300 are now considered recovered.
 The tallies, using data collected by AFP from national authorities and information from the World Health Organization (WHO), probably reflect only a fraction of the actual number of infections.
 Many countries are testing only symptomatic or the most serious cases.
 The US is the worst-hit country with 97,087 deaths from 1,622,670 cases. At least 361,239 people have been declared recovered.
 After the US, the hardest-hit countries are Britain with 36,675 deaths from 257,154 cases, Italy with 32,735 from 229,327 cases, Spain with 28,678 deaths and 235,290 cases and France at 28,332 deaths and 182,469 cases.

By the 1930s, the General Hospital had a dedicated X-Ray Department, an ophthalmic hospital which was inaugurated by Lord Willingdon on his visit to the state, an isolation ward, anti-rabic treatment, nurses quarters and electricity. With the arrival of the world class port at Willingdon Island, the Cochin Port Trust opened up a hospital on the island as well. Private hospitals began to emerge in different parts of the city in the early decades of the 20th century. Since Independence, the General Hospital of Ernakulam has become the first government hospital in the state to be accredited by the National Accreditation Board for Hospitals and Healthcare providers (NABH). On the other hand, a dedicated hospital for women, the Women’s and Children’s Hospital in Mattancherry was opened as early as 1893 with a woman civil surgeon and this runs to this day near the Mattancherry Palace.

However, the unprecedented COVID-19 crisis forced the company to temporarily shelve those plans. While the company has reduced its 2020 capital expenditure plan by 30%, it has tried to do so with minimal impact on project returns. Short-cycle investments in the Permian Basin account for the largest chunk of capital reduction. However, ExxonMobil is continuing with its three- dimensional section development approach -- called cube development -- in the Permian to optimize output. The reduced capital spend will impact Exxon's Permian volumes in 2021. It's volume reductions in 2020 will largely come from well shut-ins, which can be adjusted quickly based on market conditions.

The Inne at Riddle Village, meanwhile, was listed in state figures as having 42 resident cases, 16 staff infections and 20 deaths. But Riddle Village Executive Vice President Kim Roguszewski said Thursday that the facility actually had 34 positive cases, 25 employees and 16 deaths for its entire health care community. She added that there are no known cases at Riddle’s independent living facility.
 At least one facility, Maris Grove, was listed twice in state data with varying numbers. One line for “Maris Grove” showed zero resident infections and deaths, as well as an asterisk for the number of employees infected, indicating less than five cases.
 But Dan Dunne, director of communications for Maris Grove operator Erickson Living, noted there was another line for “Continuing Care at Maris Grove,” with 39 resident cases, less than five employee infections and 11 deaths.
 Dunne said Wednesday that there were only 16 cases still active among 1,700 residents. Deaths had also risen to 13, he said, noting all of those had complex underlying health issues. He added there are currently 16 active cases of COVID-19 among the facility’s 800 employees, but no deaths among that cohort.
 Broomall Rehabilitation and Nursing Center was listed in Tuesday’s totals as having 139 cases and 40 deaths, but Annaliese Impink, “chief experience officer” for SavaSeniorCare Consulting LLC, previously reported there were actually 171 residents at Broomall who had tested positive for COVID-19 and 46 who had died.
 Providence Rehab and Healthcare Center in Yeadon was listed as having 53 resident infections, 19 staff infections and 18 deaths.
 Administrator Jonathan Papada reported Providence is currently treating 37 COVID-19 positive residents in-house and has 37 employees diagnosed.
 "It is with heavy hearts that we confirm 16 COVID-19 related deaths involving residents as well," said Papada. "Our thoughts are with the families of those who have passed, and we deeply feel the loss within our community ... Our medical and nursing staff, quality assurance team, and department heads are working around the clock to serve the people in our care. Their steadfast professionalism and dedication remain unwavering at this unprecedented time.”

AMES -- Mark Coberly and his sports medicine staff spent the better part of a month planning how to bring student-athletes back to Iowa State safely amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
   
 They tried to consider every angle, action and avenue that might serve as an issue or a remedy as they searched for solutions to dial down the risk of exposure to a virus that has killed nearly 100,000 Americans, shut down economies across the globe and imperiled college sports' cash cow, football.
   
 It's a situation where facts are constantly changing and stakes are incredibly high.
   
 "The list never ends. It just never ends," said Coberly, ISU's associate athletic director for sports medicine. "You get one area handled, and then you think, here's another area we've got to look at.
   
 "Overwhelming is the right word, but at the end of the day, those are the things we have to think about."
   
 Coberly and his staff, though, are doing their darndest to navigate the circumstances. They spent the better part of April game-planning on what mitigation strategies would be when student-athletes returned to Ames, and have spent the last three weeks in a pilot program with a small group of student-athletes rehabbing injuries at ISU facilities.
   
 "A lot of times you think you might know what would work," Coberly said, "but until you've actually done it, you don't really know. Our fear was going to be if we can't test anything at all and we have a bunch of people all come back at once, if that doesn't work, we've got a lot of problems.
   
 "We want to keep risks of infection to everybody at the very minimum because that's the thing that will derail everybody."
   
 Without a vaccine, the name of the game is mitigation. Dialing down the risk as low as possible.
   
 "College-aged athletes, the actual physical health risks aren't extremely high for them," Coberly said, "but some of the people they work with are extremely high (risk) and we have some athletes with underlying medical conditions that can be high (risk).
   
 "That's where it's all about we're in this as a team and it's our job to think through as many things as we can to mitigate the risk as much as possible. That's what we're stepping through."
   
 The macro strategies ISU will employ are the ones that society at large as been employing over the last months. Social distancing as much as possible. Masks. Hand-washing. Extra custodial work.
   
 That's the easy stuff, the obvious issues. It's the more granular actions that can make the process overwhelming.
   
 It's never-thought-of-before things like not sharing towels between players. How do football players' gloves get disinfected? How do you handle hydration when you can't share water bottles? What do you do with shared equipment - both on the field and in the weight room? How can coaches meet safely?
   
 "The more we bring athletes in and start working with them," Coberly said, "the more it reminds us of all these different little things we've taken for granted that we've got to review and have a procedure in place."
   
 It's taken the planning process to some very unlikely places.
   
 "We've met with our custodial people and our buildings and grounds people and started talking about cleaning of areas and what that looks like and how it's being done," Coberly said. "What chemicals are we using, do we need to treat our turf field - daily? Weekly? Hourly?
   
 "What's the risk of somebody playing on a turf surface? We don't think it's very high but it's something we wanted to make sure we didn't skip to address."
   
 That's made the athletes across various sports who are in the facilities rehabbing something of guinea pigs in the service primarily of getting football - and its revenues - back.
   
 "I might feel that way," wrestler Ian Parker said, "but I'm not bothered by it at all.
   
 "We're all aware that most athletics depend on football so the quicker we can get them running, wrestling and other sports can get running. I'm ecstatic that I can help in that in any way."
   
 It's a mission that is especially critical for Parker after he saw his chance at competing for a national title disappear in March when the NCAA canceled its championships due to the pandemic. So when wrestling trainer Tim Weesner told him about the opportunity to be part of the project after Parker underwent knee surgery, he jumped at it.
   
 "I was ecstatic to come back," the Big 12's 141-pound champion said.
   
 Before arriving at the Bergstrom Football Complex - rather than Lied Recreation where he typically would train - Parker fills out an online questionnaire that asks about his whereabouts over the previous 14 days and if he is experiencing a variety of symptoms.
   
 "A huge list of all sorts of things," Parker said, "and then they take your temperature as soon as you get in the door and have a mask for you if you didn't bring a mask."
   
 Parker sees Weesner, but no other athletes while getting treatment as ISU keeps numbers to a minimum, which will perhaps be one of the larger challenges when something like over 100 football players arrive along with coaches and support staff in the dozens.
   
 "We actually spend more time closer to each other than we think, than we realize," Coberly said. "We're having to consider what that looks like when we return people and bring them in with small groups in the weight room or conditioning.
   
 "We know large group activities are not going to happen right away and they're not recommended right away. What is that going to look like? We're communicating pretty regularly with our strength coaches and our coaching staff."
   
 One of the biggest weapons in this fight, public health officials have stressed throughout the pandemic, is wide-spread testing. That, though, could be a challenge to implement in athletics in the near-term.
   
 "Everyday testing is not going to happen," Coberly said. "Athletics teams are not going to be testing regularly until regular testing is available to the public. The cost of testing is extremely high - that's going to have to be factored in as well. I think the billion dollar question that's out there and the NCAA has said it already, we're going to have to have testing available to be able to safely return, but nobody has defined that yet of what that is because nobody knows.
   
 "What does that look like? Today is going to be different than a month from now. I'm sure it is. So we're all basically in the preparation mode to get everything we need in place from a resource standpoint and wait for those recommendations to come. I do believe one of our biggest challenges across the country is going to be testing availability and what tests are they?"
   
 With all the preparation, thought and effort ISU is putting in to bringing athletes back to campus and keeping them safe while they're there, Coberly is confident that ISU's facilities will be incredibly safe for athletes and staff.
   
 Athletes and staff, though, don't spend 100 percent of their time within the confines of ISU facilities.
   
 "What you're doing outside of these walls is probably more important than what we're doing inside of these walls," Coberly said, "because that's when the exposure is going to go up if you don't practice these mitigation strategies. That's what's going to keep everybody else in the program safe as well.
   
 "That's going to be some pretty strong messaging to athletes all across the country. If they're going to have a chance to have these seasons go, the biggest threat to the season is some team-wide infections where they have to shut some sports down. That's going to be the biggest threat to success."
   
 That type of personal responsibility will just have to be an added cost to success.
   
 "It's not the conventional way of thinking," Parker said, "but if you really have those high goals and you're really devoted to them, this will just be another part of it like your diet and your social life at night and workouts.
   
 "The social distancing will just be another part of that to mitigate outbreaks."
   
 The scope of planning for a pandemic is all-consuming. It is, simply, overwhelming.
   
 It also might be doable.
   
 "We have what we think are preliminary plans that we think go all the way up to when school starts," Coberly said, "but those change literally daily based on what we're learning.
   
 "It's a really daunting task. I do think it's doable or we would tell everybody it wasn't. We just have to make sure we're doing as much as we can to mitigate."

When you first set eyes on the home, you might mistake it for an elaborate three-car garage -- with three stately bays, windows on the second floor and stairs and balconies winding around. It was originally intended as just that, with the owners being car enthusiasts. But they also built a very enchanting loft-style home on the second level that stretches the full length of the building as one continuous open space. Though partitioned only by exposed beams and rafters, it affords a surprising amount of privacy.
