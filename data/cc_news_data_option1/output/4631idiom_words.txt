Police on Wednesday said that they had arrested a nurse for allegedly trying to give overdoses to at least three people in his care. Police and prosecutors said that the 24-year-old suspect tried to play the savior by taking the patients to the brink of death before reviving them. The authorities received a tip-off on Sunday from a doctor at the Munich hospital where the suspect had worked since July last year and said they were now investigating all potentially suspicious cases on his watch. The nurse, who was not identified by police, was arrested on Monday on three counts of attempted murder and grievous bodily harm — allegations that he denies. One of the people affected is still in a critical, but stable condition, while the other two have recovered.         *[FT]: Financial Times

After exploring the remains of the Old City, leave the walled city through the East Gate, the starting point of the Old Intercity Road. At first, you will walk along the original route on the aptly named Dongmen Road (東門路: literally East Gate Road). However, this road is soon interrupted by a strip of railway land and a detour is required to get around to the other side, where Dongmen Road continues. With the TRA tracks now underground in Kaohsiung, the two halves of the road may soon be reconnected, restoring the continuous path leading to the East Gate that existed for over two centuries.

Continuing eastward, except for a couple of small alleyways that seem completely out of place, the original route in this section has been erased and replaced by modern city streets in a grid. The Old Intercity Road crossed Love River (愛河) right beside the location of the current bridge on Zihyou Road (自由路), but the original Qing-era bridge has been dismantled with no trace remaining. East of the river, the original route follows modern-day roads for most of the next several kilometers, except where it passes through the schoolyards of two schools and is interrupted by National Freeway 1.
