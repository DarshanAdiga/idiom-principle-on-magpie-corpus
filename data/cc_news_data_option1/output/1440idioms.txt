With peak demand, if you have a big spike in electricity during an on-peak activity, the demand fee will increase proportionately. If you have the flexibility to spread out your energy demand by running things at night, the fees will be manageable.
 Electricity is the cheapest with the time of use demand plan but, electricity consumption must be managed. Rosie says not to let this plan scare you away just because of the demand charge. If you and your household are willing to manage your demand load and time of use, there is the biggest potential for saving money. A programmable thermostat is a must on this plan.

 Officials here have at present readied a model testing cabin for COVID-19 and are planning to get five more testing cabins in the district.
 J. Nirmalsen, Deputy Director of Health Services here said, “at present one booth has been readied and we are looking for arranging five more similar booths here. These would work as mobile booths, they would be carried on vehicles to different places here for collection of samples from the public.”
 Dr. Nirmalsen said that lab technicians have been trained in the district regarding sample collection procedures and samples could also be collected through lab facilities at its block-level primary health centres.
 As on Saturday, 14 persons are undergoing treatment for COVID-19 disease at Government Mohan Kumaranagalam Medical College Hospital. Officials have set up containment zones at places where the positive cases were identified and their contacts have been quarantined.
 Dr. Nirmalsen said that they have collected over 500 samples and necessary measures are being taken to prevent the spread of the disease.
 “Public should avoid venturing out of their houses and even if they do, they should wash their clothes with disinfectants and take a bath on return. Those advised home isolation should stay within their rooms as they would do during chicken pox and avoid contact even with other persons in the house”, he said.

Some do not have the resources at home to be able to do this, and they’re trying to find workarounds. They are being told information on the new protocols at the same time as you. Most, if not all lecturers are now keeping a closer eye on emails in order to help in any way they can, as they understand how much harder it is for you. Believe me when I say it’s often a lot easier to explain something in person than over email – especially in technical subjects. I’ve personally had to respond to the same question more than once in different ways, while trying not to give the answer – I’d normally draw diagrams on paper.

The fishing community is staring at hard times in the wake of the lockdown. The State government’s decision to ease fishing curbs has brought some relief, but for fisherwomen, many of whom single-handedly put food on the table, there is little solace.
 Simi (name changed), a fisherwoman who lives at Poonthura and sells fish at the Palayam market, says it has been nearly a month since she has stepped outside to sell fish. “Many women head their households, and without any earnings, it is difficult to make ends meet.” A couple of women in the area have been going to sell fish. Simi feels it is foolhardy and puts all the residents at risk. Agrees Lettie, also a Poonthura resident, “We live in crowded conditions and have small children. We are inviting trouble if we go out.”
 Only country craft from a few areas are heading out for near-shore fishing. This means the catch is inadequate, and prices are high consequently. Says Shelley who sells fish in a city market: “We cannot afford to pay ₹8,000 for a basket of fish. And even if we do, we may not be able to sell it at that price to customers.”
 It does not help that the markets are closed. “If some mechanism were to be devised to keep the markets open, I could call up customers and tell them to come. But again, people are not spending as much during the lockdown as before,” she says. Jennie, who sells fish at a market, alleges that she is being hounded by the police. “They keep asking me to move. If the government has allowed fish to be caught, I should be able to sell it. I am a widow. Why create trouble for people like me,” she says over phone.
 ## Door-to-door sales
 A few fisherwomen are also making door-to-door sales. Assured of regular customers, they do not mind paying a bit extra when picking up fish.
 However, there are concerns about crowding at the fish-landing centres.
 The ration the fishers get from the government is what many of them are making do with. With the likely extension of the lockdown, the women are worried how they will feed their families if they do not go to work.
 Self Employed Women’s Association (SEWA) Union secretary Sonia George says as the fisherwomen are not able to carry on their livelihood, the government should step in to support them by implementing practices such as rotation for going to sea, thereby preventing crowding. Facilities should also be made to open markets on a rotation basis.
 A.J. Vijayan, activist, says besides fixing the price for fish, fixing the quota for traders will leave enough fish to go around.

OPEC, Russia and other oil producing nations were meeting on Sunday in a bid to clinch a deal on the biggest oil cut ever, amounting to 10 percent of global supply, after their initial efforts to support oil prices amid the coronavirus pandemic were blocked by Mexico.
 The group, known as OPEC+, was expected to start a video conference at 1600 GMT. On Thursday, OPEC+ outlined plans to cut output by more than a fifth, or by 10 million barrels per day (bpd), but Mexico balked at the production cuts it was asked to make, delaying the signing of a final deal.
 "The ministerial meeting between OPEC and non-OPEC members is a follow-up after the April 9 meeting," the energy ministry of OPEC+ member Azerbaijan said on Sunday. (For an analysis on the reasons behind Mexico's stand-off with OPEC+ click on)
 Measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus have destroyed demand for fuel and driven down oil prices, straining budgets of oil producers and hammering the U.S. shale industry, which is more vulnerable to low prices due to its higher costs. OPEC+ also said it wanted producers outside the group, such as the United States, Canada, Brazil and Norway, to cut a further 5% or 5 million bpd.
 Canada and Norway signalled willingness to cut and the United States, where legislation makes it hard to act in tandem with cartels such as OPEC, has said its output would fall steeply by itself this year due to low prices. Mexico President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Friday that U.S. President Donald Trump had offered to make extra U.S. cuts on his behalf, an unusual offer by a Trump who has long railed against OPEC.
 Trump, who had threatened Saudi Arabia with oil tariffs if it did not fix the market's oversupply problem, said Washington would help Mexico by picking up "some of the slack" and being reimbursed later. He did not say how this would work and OPEC leader Saudi Arabia has so far refused to accept the fix, according to OPEC sources.
 Global oil demand is estimated to have fallen by a third as more than 3 billion people are locked down in their homes due to the coronavirus outbreak. A 15 percent cut in supply might not be enough to arrest the price decline, banks Goldman Sachs and UBS predicted last week, saying Brent prices would fall back to $20 per barrel from $32 at the moment and $70 at the start of the year.

"Because we are synchronizing with the natural cycle of the disease, we are effectively isolating the invisible spreaders," he concluded.
 Barzel maintained that just by splitting the population you are already reducing the amount of interaction and thereby lowering the infection rate. But, he said, "for COVID-19 this is not enough." As such, sick people, whether they have tested positive for the virus or not, would be isolated at all times.
 Barzel and his research team simulated the spread of COVID-19 using the SEIR model. This assumes people carry lifelong immunity to a virus or other disease upon recovery, but for many diseases the immunity after infection wanes over time, which would allow recovered individuals to return to a susceptible state.
 "This model tracks the number of individuals as they transition between the different stages of the disease: susceptible (those available to contract the disease), exposed (those who are at their pre-symptomatic stage), infected (those who develop symptoms) and recovered (those who are already immune)," a release provided by the university explained.
 Moreover, the researchers accounted for a fraction of defectors who continue to be active even during their lockdown phase and exempt individuals, such as essential workers.
 "In a perfect world, we could cure the disease in two weeks, but the world is not perfect," Barzel told the _Post_. "Some people take more than a week to show symptoms and some people don't exactly abide by the rules. Our model allows for some people to take a week-and-a-half to develop symptoms and we miss those people and they will go out and infect others."
 Even if around 15% violate their lockdown, "we will still kill the disease rather efficiently," according to the model.
 The best way to create these two groups, he said, is to work with local authorities who will divide up their constituencies by address. Then, entire buildings would be on lockdown or free to move about, also reducing infection, since residents of apartment complexes use the same elevators, staircases and more.
 At the same time, whole families will be included in shifts, so that schools are open and children have school on the same weeks that their parents work. The government would have to inform businesses to operate at 50% and arrange their workers based on their pre-assigned shifts.
 "For 90% this will be enough," he said. "As long as school and work are aligned, then the only reason to break isolation would be if you really want to go to the shopping mall. Some people will do that."
 But he said that there is an option to use an app that would indicate if a person is supposed to be in or out of isolation. If the person is supposed to be on lockdown and he approaches the mall, the guard could check his or her app. If there is a green light he could enter. If red, he would be turned away.
 Barzel said that Israel can "take risks" as long as the number of people hospitalized and in need of intubation stays below 2,000. His plan, keeps the country at an average of 1,600 people on ventilators, he said.
 "We can achieve more if we also adopt responsible behavior," he added, and therefore those not on lockdown would still be encouraged to wear masks and stay two meters apart from one another.
 The team's mathematical analysis and numerical results, including all their codes, was recently published on the Arxive and has gained traction.
 Barzel and team are working with the National Security Council and have presented the strategy to the academic committee advising the government. They were also contacted by international groups in the US advising 17 governments around the world. Barzel has consulted with officials in Italy and Brazil, too.
 He told the _Post_ that "there is a good chance" alternating lockdowns will be implemented alongside as part of any exit strategy.

Former Liverpool forward Craig Bellamy says it comes as little surprise that Philippe Coutinho wants to join Barcelona, amid reports that the Premier League club have rejected a fresh bid.
 It was claimed in England on Friday that Barca lodged an offer of £114million for the Brazil international that was immediately rejected by Liverpool.
 The Catalans reportedly saw a bid of £90m turned down last week after Coutinho submitted a transfer request, but Liverpool's stance has always been that the player is not for sale.
 But Bellamy, who enjoyed two separate spells at Anfield, understands why the 25-year-old would want to move to Camp Nou.
 "If a player came to see me and asked to leave, I'd want to know the reason why and if it was a club like Barcelona I'd understand," the former Wales international wrote in a column for Paddy Power.
 "At the same time, if the footballer sees his future elsewhere then as a manager I have to prepare and move on to other targets.
 "I can understand why Liverpool want to hold on to Philippe Coutinho – a lot of clubs are taking a hard line now. They don't have to sell these days.
 "But Coutinho has to want to leave – of course he does. It's very easy to point the fingers at footballers but, no matter what your job is, if you had the chance to go to the best in the business, getting paid way more than you are, then you're going to want to take that offer up."
 Coutinho, along with Borussia Dortmund's Ousmane Dembele, is said to be a prime target for Barca following the world-record €222m sale of Neymar to Paris Saint-Germain.
 General manager Pep Segura suggested that deals for both players were close, but that assertion was refuted by Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp and Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke.
 Coutinho has yet to play competitively this season after picking up a back injury.

Andre Villas-Boas believes Paulinho's prospective move to Barcelona from Guangzhou Evergrande Taobao is a fillip for the Chinese Super League.
 Guangzhou head coach Luiz Felipe Scolari and captain Zheng Zhi confirmed on Sunday that the 29-year-old Brazil international was set to move to Camp Nou, with Barca belatedly agreeing to pay a release clause thought to be in the region of €40million.
 The CSL and a number of its high profile recruits have been criticised over the past year amid accusations players leaving Europe's major leagues are doing so purely for financial gain and turning their backs on superior standards of football.
 But Villas-Boas, who managed Paulinho during the midfielder's time at Tottenham, suggested such claims must be wide of the mark if a club of Barca's standing are looking towards the CSL in order to improve their squad.
 "Paulinho’s departure is a loss for Guangzhou Evergrande but a gain for Chinese football," said the Portuguese coach after his Shanghai SIPG beat Chongqing Lifan 3-2.
 "The fact that Paulinho has transferred to one of the best clubs in the world means that those big clubs are paying close attention to the CSL."

Big Brothers Big Sisters of Beaver County, like many non-profit organizations, has been impacted by novel coronavirus, but developed approaches to continue its work.
   
 Its full- and part-time employees work from home to maintain and support one- to-one mentoring matches between adult volunteers called "Bigs" and children ages 5 through young adulthood called "Littles," a program that works with nearly 250 youth and families.
   
 Such mentoring, BBBS says, helps children perform better in school, make healthier choices, have higher self-esteem, and get along better with peers and family.
   
 The ideal match is face-to-face, but with this time of social distancing, Bigs maintain contact with Littles via telephone, email, FaceTime, Skype and other social media tools, said Kim Anastas, executive director, in a statement.
   
 "We have shared tips on playing online games, mailing cards, virtual scavenger hunts, and more. This has been working well with our community matches," she said. "We are encouraging Bigs that their role is to help alleviate their Littles' fears and at the very least, to stress to the Littles that they are cared for."
   
 Anastas said BBBS' Geneva College program will not resume until at least September because Geneva students will finish the semester remotely. Returning Bigs have been asked to maintain contact with Littles at least through May. Bigs not returning to Geneva because of graduation or other circumstances have been asked to make final contact with Littles and staff will touch base with families to communicate future eligibility for rematch, she said.
   
 Its Beyond School Walls workplace mentoring program is also on hiatus until schools resume. Lincoln Learning Solutions, a partner and site for BSW, is working to connect Bigs and Littles via monthly live remote.

In the 11 weeks since that interview, the coronavirus has reached every corner of the globe. It has infected more than 500,000 Americans and killed at least 20,000. It has rewritten the rules of society, isolated people in their homes, closed schools, devastated the economy and put millions out of work.
 When Trump spoke in Switzerland, weeks’ worth of warning signs already had been raised. In the ensuing month, before the president first addressed the crisis from the White House, key steps to prepare the nation for the coming pandemic were not taken.
 Life-saving medical equipment was not stockpiled. Travel largely continued unabated. Vital public health data from China was not provided or was deemed untrustworthy. A White House riven by rivalries and turnover was slow to act. Urgent warnings were ignored by a president consumed by his impeachment trial and intent on protecting a robust economy that he viewed as central to his reelection chances.
 Twenty current and former administration officials and Republicans close to the White House were interviewed for this account about the critical weeks lost before the president spoke to the nation on Feb. 26. Most spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about private discussions.

 ‘MYSTERIOUS PNEUMONIA’
 On New Year’s Eve, China informed the World Health Organization of a “mysterious pneumonia outbreak” spreading through Wuhan, an industrial city of 11 million.
 The government closed a seafood market at the center of the outbreak, moved all patients with the virus to a specially designated hospital and collected test samples to send to government laboratories. Doctors were told to stay quiet; one who issued a warning online was punished. He later died of the virus.
 The Pentagon first learned about the new coronavirus in December from open source reports emanating from China. By early January, warnings about the virus had made their way into intelligence reports circulating around the government. On Jan. 3, the head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Robert Redfield, received a call from his Chinese counterpart with an official warning.
 Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government's top infectious disease expert, was alerted to the virus around the same time — and within two weeks was fearful it could bring global catastrophe.
 Quickly, U.S. intelligence and public health officials began doubting China's reported rates of infection and death toll. They pressed China to allow in U.S. epidemiologists — both to assist the country in confronting the spread and to gain valuable insights that could help buy time for the U.S. response. U.S. officials also pressed China to send samples of the virus to U.S. labs for study and for vaccine and test development.
 On Jan. 11, China shared the virus’ genetic sequence. That same day, the National Institutes of Health started working on a vaccine.
 Ultimately, the U.S. was able to get China’s consent to send two people on the WHO team that traveled to China later in the month. But by then precious weeks had been lost and the virus had raced across Asia and had begun to escape the continent.

 BALANCING ACT
 For much of January, administration officials were doing a delicate balancing act.
 Internally, they were raising alarms about the need to get Americans on the ground in China. Publicly, they were sending words of encouragement and praise in hopes Beijing would grant the Americans access.
 Matthew Pottinger, Trump's deputy national security adviser, persistently urged more aggressive action in calling out China and sending teams there.
 But while word of the virus was included in several of the president’s intelligence briefings, Trump wasn’t fully briefed on the threat until Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar called with an update on Jan. 18 while the president was at his private Mar-a-Lago club in Florida.
 Trump spent much of the conversation wanting to talk about vaping; he was considering a new policy restricting its use. White House officials now believe Trump didn’t fully grasp the magnitude of the threat to the U.S. in part because Azar, who was feuding with several members of Trump’s inner circle, did a poor job communicating it.
 Azar was trying to walk a fine line between Trump’s upbeat statements and preparing the government for what might lie ahead. “America’s risk is low at the moment,” he later told House lawmakers. “That could change quickly.”
 Moreover, the president was in the middle of his Senate impeachment trial and focused on little else, punctuating nearly every White House meeting with complaints about the Democrats out to get him, grievances he would continue late into the night on the phone from his private quarters.

The new guidelines of “social distancing” are also a constant worry that plays on our minds and it has made a massive impact on people’s mental health. I am one of the many retail workers that work in the front line and coming into contact with a huge number of customers on the shop floor is honestly driving my anxiety through the roof. As much as I try to keep my distance from customers, they still take one step forward while you take two steps back. It seems that no matter how many lines of tape we put down or how many times we tell customers to distance themselves from you, it goes in one ear and out the other! The whole point of this new guideline was to reduce the risk of people contracting the virus, yet I’m seeing people come in with their entire families and group of friends. Are people not understanding that they are putting others at risk? Maybe they will finally learn a lesson when it’s their family member who gets sick. Saying that does seem a little harsh, but it’s a global pandemic and we need to listen to these guidelines, because they are there to protect us and if we keep pushing against those guidelines, then we are in major trouble.

Couples are often told to prepare for anything when it comes to their wedding, but a global pandemic isn't typically something to consider.
 Now that most Americans have been ordered to stay at home and avoid nonessential travel to slow the spread of the coronavirus, many couples -- including those who were only days or weeks away from getting married -- have had to abruptly postpone their special day, while many others are in limbo, unsure of how to proceed.
 "Postponing our wedding has opened up an entire different category of stress that I didn't know was possible," says Allison Hayes, a newly unemployed hairstylist in Ohio who delayed her May wedding.
 The scale of postponements is also unprecedented for vendors and planners.
 "We've never seen such major sweeping postponements in the wedding industry," says Renee Dalo, owner and lead wedding planner of Moxie Bright Events in Los Angeles. Dalo has already rescheduled six weddings and expects that number to grow.
 "It was a lot of stress in a really short amount of time," says Elliott San, a Los Angeles-based screenwriter who moved his March wedding to November. "It felt like 48 hours of crisis management response."
 In addition to the logistical headache of moving a tightly coordinated event at the eleventh hour, there are also potential financial implications for couples. Some may lose deposits with vendors; others are suddenly without jobs and are juggling wedding payments with other bills.
 Here are a few things to keep in mind if you and your partner are in a similar predicament.
 LOOK FOR WAYS TO PARE BACK
 If the pandemic has had an impact on your wages, the wedding will likely need to take a back seat to more pressing needs.
 The hair salon where Hayes works has been shuttered temporarily, so she is also feeling anxiety about paying for the wedding.
 "My partner and I had been budgeting and saving our money to pay for a significant portion of our wedding costs, but we just lost the weekly payments my income was putting into our wedding account," she says.
 If your job has been affected, take steps to get control of your finances in the short-term. Look into expanded unemployment benefits as a way to help cover things like rent or groceries. Your bills should take priority over wedding plans. If money is an issue, Dalo suggests contacting vendors directly to see if you can split up payments moving forward.
 "If a client came to me asking to make smaller, more spread out payments, I would be 100% on board with that," she says. "We're all doing what we can to stay afloat and navigate the crisis together."
 Regardless of your current job situation, it's a good time to reevaluate wedding costs that haven't already been paid and see where you could scale back, if necessary.
 Hayes now plans to cut back on decorations. She had been holding off on purchasing them and has decided to have fewer since she'll have less time to decorate on her new date.
 "I was financially confident at the beginning of wedding planning, but I work in freelance and have lost a lot of opportunities," says Katy Colloton, an actress and screenwriter in Los Angeles. Colloton says she was originally planning to "go all-out" with things like table favors, bridal party gifts and welcome bags, but will adjust her approach if the job market continues to decline.
 CONTACT YOUR VENUE
 Vendors, planners and couples all agree that if you're in the process of postponing, your first call or email should be to the venue.
 "Get in contact with the venue first since that is the biggest investment, then get in touch with vendors to see how everything aligns," says Laura Yap, who runs a floral business in Austin, Texas.
 Dalo echoes this advice, but notes that venues may have different approaches depending on their contract and schedule.
 "One private club is switching the wedding to another Saturday with no fees, while another venue has asked for a $7,000 surcharge to keep it on a Saturday," she says. "It really depends on the venue."
 San says his Palm Springs venue was understanding and accommodating, while Hayes laments that hers had only two days open for the rest of 2020 -- and one was the day after Christmas.
 Start those conversations with your venue as soon as possible and try to be realistic. If you're set on not paying any more than you already have, you may have to make some trade-offs.
 "Some venues can't give you another Saturday, but they'll give you a Friday or Sunday," Dalo says. "I think that's a good compromise."
 START PRIORITIZING VENDORS
 While many vendors are trying to be flexible, the reality is that they may not all be available on your new date, especially as more weddings are rescheduled for fall and winter.
 "We have paid nonrefundable deposits for all of our vendors, and the most stressful part is trying to either line all of them up or choose which ones to take a loss with and potentially hire someone else," Hayes says.
 Delia Turner, a criminal attorney in Missouri, wasn't able to keep her photographer and hair and makeup artist. "The photographer is a good friend of mine, but she wasn't available. She will subcontract someone for me. I also lost a $100 deposit on a hair and makeup artist."
 As you begin the postponement process, prioritize the vendors that matter the most to you as you work with your venue to find a new date. Cost could be a factor -- replacing a videographer will likely be more expensive than finding a new hair and makeup artist -- but also keep in mind that your vendors are dealing with personal and professional upheaval now, too.
 "Remember that everyone is human. Small-business owners have already invested so much work, and half of that work is administrative," says Yap, who is temporarily pivoting to weekly flower deliveries to maintain a positive cash flow. "Spring is my largest season. I had ramped up with staffing and invested time into planning, so I'm figuring out how to make that all work."
 CHECK OUT WEDDING INSURANCE
 "Our biggest regret is not purchasing wedding insurance," says Crystal Ramirez, whose New Orleans wedding was postponed a week before she and her fiance lost their jobs. (She was an industrial insulator and he worked at an oil refinery.)
 If your wedding is several weeks or months away, you may have time to get wedding insurance. There are two main types of coverage, liability insurance and cancellation or postponement coverage, and you can get one or both. Some venues already require liability insurance, but Dalo recommends taking the extra step of getting cancellation insurance as well.
 However, be sure to read the fine print and consult your insurance provider. Whether cancellation coverage will reimburse events postponed due to the coronavirus outbreak may depend on city and state restrictions.
 "One of my client's cancellation coverage kicked in once the shelter-in-place order became mandatory. A recommendation from the local government wouldn't cover it, but a mandate did," she says.
 Continue to keep an eye on restrictions in the location where you're getting married and contact your insurance providers directly with any questions.
 KEEP THINGS IN PERSPECTIVE
 It's upsetting to have to reschedule an event you've been planning for months or even years, but make sure you're giving yourself mental space to concentrate on your day-to-day needs.
 For San, that means shifting focus to his fiancee Emily, who is returning to her job as a nurse after taking some time off for their now-delayed wedding.
 "Once the dust settled and we rescheduled, we pivoted to being more concerned about her going back to the hospital. I have something new to worry about besides this wedding," he says.
 Ultimately, it also helps to maintain some perspective and know you're not alone. Some couples are finding comfort in realizing they have a lot to be thankful for.
 "Remember what's important: your health and your family and friends' health," Colloton says. "A wedding is a special day, but it's one day and one party. This seems so small compared to what is happening in the world."

Despite a poor start to the Championship season, Aston Villa manager Steve Bruce maintains belief he can lead the side to promotion.
 After Saturday's 3-0 defeat to Cardiff City, Villa again lost away from home Tuesday, going down 2-1 to Reading.
 However, Bruce believes perceptions of his side's capabilities have been inflated since signing John Terry from Chelsea.
 "We obviously signed JT, people got carried away with the euphoria of it all," Bruce said. "We are where we are and I'm convinced I'm the right one to turn it around.
 "There's still obviously a load of work to be done but judge us when all the players are fit and ready and at the minute we are having a tough time.
 "We have had a tough start – Newcastle (United) had a tough start last year – we have to batton down the hatches, still believe in what we are doing and get that win which will obviously give everyone a lift."
 Since defeating Bournemouth on the opening day of the 2015-16 Premier League season, Villa has only won four matches on the road.
 Appointed after Roberto di Matteo's dismissal in October, Bruce has achieved promotion to the Premier League four times in his career.
 With a long season ahead, the 56-year-old insisted he has the experience to help Villa return to the English top flight.
 "The club has been in constant change round in every transfer window for the past five or six – there is no denying that," Bruce said.
 "At the minute we are all disappointed with it but that is where we are, so we have to accept it, take the flak that comes your way in getting beat these days, and that's what any manager of a club like ours has to put up with.
 "I am not shy in my belief we will turn it round and we will make a fist of it."
 Aston Villa next match is Saturday, when they host Norwich City.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The United States’ top infectious disease expert said Sunday that the economy in parts of the country could have a “rolling reentry” as early as next month, provided health authorities can quickly identify and isolate people who will inevitably be infected with the coronavirus.Dr. Anthony Fauci also said he "can't guarantee" that it will be safe for Americans to vote in person on Election Day, Nov. 3.Rather than flipping a switch to reopen the entire country, Fauci said a gradual process will be required based on the status of the pandemic in various parts of the U.S. and the availability of rapid, widespread testing. Once the number of people who are seriously ill sharply declines, officials can begin to "think about a gradual reentry of some sort of normality, some rolling reentry," Fauci said.In some places, he said, that might occur as soon as May. "We are hoping that, at the end of the month, we could look around and say, OK, is there any element here that we can safely and cautiously start pulling back on? If so, do it. If not, then just continue to hunker down," Fauci said.Whenever restrictions ease, Fauci said, "we know that there will be people who will be getting infected. I mean, that is just reality. "Social distancing guidelines imposed by President Donald Trump are set to expire April 30.Trump is eager to restart the economy, which has stalled because most Americans are under orders to "stay at home" to help slow the virus' spread.But governors will have a lot to say about when to ease restrictions in their states, and the leaders of Maryland and New Jersey indicated Sunday that they are not likely to do so until widespread testing is available."The question is how fast we can get enough tests up to speed in order to help us get to the point where we are able to do all of those things," Gov. Larry Hogan, R-Md., said. He said he has set no "artificial deadline."Gov. Phil Murphy, D-N.J., said the risks of reopening too soon are dangerously high. "And I fear, if we open up too early, and we have not sufficiently made that health recovery and cracked the back of this virus, that we could be pouring gasoline on the fire, even inadvertently," Murphy told.Increased testing would allow authorities to identify, isolate and trace the contacts of people who are newly infected, Fauci said.Other scientists have echoed Fauci's call for a gradual reopening, where restrictions can be ramped up or down.Trump continues to deny continuing problems with the coronavirus testing that's available, including shortages and long wait times for people to learn results. He's also resistant to the idea of more widespread testing, saying last week that "it's unnecessary" and that "vast areas of our country don't need this."Speaking about the prospects of Americans physically going to polling places in November, Fauci said he hopes voting in person can take place. "I believe that if we have a good, measured way of rolling into this, steps towards normality, that we hope, by the time we get to November, that we will be able to do it in a way which is the standard way," he said.."However — and I don't want to be the pessimistic person — there is always the possibility, as we get into next fall, and the beginning of early winter, that we could see a rebound," he said.The U.S. has the most confirmed cases and deaths of any nation, more than 530,000 and 20,600, respectively, according to Johns Hopkins University. In hard-hit New York, the number of deaths has topped 700 for five straight days, but the increase in people who are hospitalized is slowing, in a hopeful sign.For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death.Fauci was on CNN’s "State of the Union.'' Hogan appeared on ABC’s "This Week'' and Murphy was on CNN and CBS’ “Face the Nation.”Copyright 2020 Associated Press. All rights reserved.

A massive internal storm may be coming that the coronavirus may delay, but cannot stop.
 If it does, it will pit Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Mossad Director Yossi Cohen and others against Blue and White leaders Benny Gantz and Gabi Ashkenazi, as well as IDF Chief of Staff Lt.- Gen. Aviv Kochavi, over how to deal with Iran.
 According to numerous interviews by The Jerusalem Post with current and former Mossad, CIA and other national security officials in the US and Israel, a point may get closer where the Islamic Republic of Iran will escalate its levels of uranium enrichment dangerously close to levels where it could weaponize within a short period.
 This will draw Netanyahu, Cohen and their camp closer to a desire to preemptively strike Iran, while Gantz, Ashkenazi, Kochavi and their camp are more likely to define the "point of no return" - after which Tehran cannot be stopped from going nuclear - as a good bit later.
 This debate would echo the all-out fight between Netanyahu and Gantz and Ashkenazi in 2010 and afterwards.
 During that period, the Blue and White MKs followed each other as IDF chiefs and, especially Ashkenazi, helped block an Israeli preemptive strike, along with then-Mossad chiefs Meir Dagan and Tamir Pardo.
 Pardo has since confirmed that he even discussed the issue with then-attorney- general Yehuda Weinstein. He explained that he believed a Netanyahu order to move pieces in place for a near-immediate attack on Iran without full security cabinet approval was illegal and said Weinstein confirmed his position.
 There are multiple narratives, with one involving confusing moves by Netanyahu and then-defense minister Ehud Barak to merely scare the world into thinking they would attack.
 But the majority public narrative is that the defense establishment's opposition blocked Netanyahu and Barak from launching an attack.
 Most expert estimates already have Tehran's time to break out for a nuclear bomb - if it chooses to do so, which all agree it has not yet - down from 12 months to between three and a half to six months.
 In early March, the usually relatively Iran-friendly International Atomic Energy Agency reported that the ayatollahs already had enough low-level (between 3.67-5%) enriched uranium for a nuclear weapon - should Iran make the decision to enrich to higher levels.
 Multiple intelligence sources have indicated to the Post a belief that the Islamic Republic may jump to 20% enrichment, a step it took before the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.
 Some sources even speculated that Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei may green light a small amount of enrichment at the 60% level (uranium becomes weaponized at the 90% level) - an idea the country already played with months ago, but has not yet carried out.
 But sources have indicated that top intelligence officials in favor of an earlier military option to stop Iran from getting a nuclear bomb are not looking at just one specific factor.
 Rather, they are looking at the full picture of Tehran's actions, which will indicate whether it has made the decision to go to the threshold.
 According to intelligence officials who view the point of no return as an earlier point in time, they look at nuclear enrichment as a more decisive factor for interpreting Iran's intentions than the ability to deliver a nuclear weapon.
 Put differently, they believe Israel would need to act militarily once Iran has enough nuclear material for a weapon, and that it could not wait for the point at which it is confirmed that Iran can properly fire the weapon.
 The rationale of these intelligence officials is that enriching uranium and working on weapons delivery issues, though separate skills to master, do not need to happen in a chronological fashion.
 Instead, intelligence officials have noted to the Post that the Islamic Republic could be working through problems with delivering a nuclear warhead on its Shahab 3 missile or other missiles in parallel to its uranium enrichment.
 Further, these officials said once Iran gets to within a certain proximity to enough weaponized material for a nuclear bomb, the uncertainties - which might drag out the process by some period of weeks or might be solved immediately - are too fluid.
 THERE IS a lesson from the North Korea case.
 With North Korea, at some point the world was surprised by how slow it moved forward with developing nuclear weapons. However, later it shocked the world by being months ahead of what was expected. Exporting this lesson to Iran, it means the point of no return cannot wait for the clock to run out entirely.
 Those intelligence officials in this camp are also keeping a careful eye on relations between the IAEA and the ayatollahs. Relations have gotten shakier since the March report, which used harsher language than usual against the regime.
 In contrast, in January, Kochavi publicly laid out that he did not view Iran as a real nuclear threat until deep into 2021.
 The Post has asked the IDF if Kochavi might move his calendar up by nine months since he also predicted in January that Tehran would not have enough low-enriched uranium for a bomb before December. Yet, the regime crossed that threshold already in March.
 The IDF did not respond and has not issued a revised timeline.
 This suggests that the IDF will not change its calendar as long as Iran is not enriching uranium to higher levels.
 However, even more significantly, Kochavi explicitly treated the issues of uranium enrichment and nuclear weapons delivery as separate and chronological. He said weapons delivery pushed the nuclear threat off until deep into 2021.
 It appears that this was the position of Ashkenazi and Gantz back in the 2010 era when they held Kochavi's job.
 At that point - and leading up to the 2015 nuclear deal - Iran went far beyond where it is today with nuclear enrichment, yet they were still dead set against Netanyahu and Barak's discussion/order to attack.
 Before the 2015 nuclear deal, Iran had enough low-enriched uranium for around 10 nuclear bombs and had substantial amounts of uranium enriched to the 20% level - which it has not done yet this time.
 So even if Khamenei brings Iran far beyond its current uranium stock of low- enriched uranium for one weapon, and if he orders uranium enrichment at the 20% level, a rematch could mean Netanyahu's Blue and White partners trying to hold him back from an attack.
 Kochavi in the present, and Gantz, Ashkenazi, Dagan and Pardo from the past and present, in part represent an IDF mentality of needing to juggle short- term threats, like Hezbollah and Hamas, with long-term threats. They also represent an intelligence perspective beyond the IDF that even a surgical strike solely on Iran's nuclear facilities could likely lead to a broader war with Iran and its proxies.
 In contrast, Netanyahu and Cohen now, and Barak in the past, represented a mentality that the risks of Iran developing a nuclear weapon are so great (that it might use a weapon or that it could use the weapon to act more aggressively in the region) that it trumps other risks and warrants acting sooner.
 This future internal war, a rematch of the 2010 era, could decide the fate of the country.

While Hahn also echoed President Trump's assertion that the U.S. can "see the light at the end of the tunnel," he did not go so far as to give a date when the country could reopen and social distancing guidelines could be relaxed. Trump has recently mentioned May 1 as a possible date for at least parts of the country to reopen, even as governors in many states have said the crisis will go on much longer.

 United States President Donald Trump ordered his government to give support to coronavirus-hit Italy, in a memorandum published late Friday. '[Italy], one of our closest and oldest Allies, is being ravaged by the COVID-19 pandemic,' Trump wrote in the memo. Although the US government's 'first and foremost responsibility is to the American people,' helping Italy will help mitigate the impact of the crisis, and demonstrate US leadership, he wrote. Trump ordered US military personnel stationed in Italy to be made available to help set up field hospitals and transport supplies, fuel and food. The order added that Italians who need medical care unrelated to the Covid-19 illness caused by the virus may be treated in US military medical facilities. US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross was asked to encourage US suppliers to deliver necessary supplies, such as medical equipment, as requested by the Italian authorities. Italy had the highest death toll from coronavirus in the world as of Friday, with 18,849 fatalities, according to the country's Civil Protection Agency. The US followed closely, with 18,769 recorded deaths as of early Saturday, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.

“I can’t thank them enough,' Johnson said in his first public statement since he was moved out of intensive care Thursday night at St. Thomas’ Hospital in London. 'I owe them my life,” the premier stressed as making comments related his health status. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he owes his life to the National Health Service staff who treated him for COVID-19, ahead of figures Sunday in which the U.K. is expected to surpass 10,000 coronavirus-related deaths. 'I can't thank them enough,' Johnson said in his first public statement since he was moved out of intensive care Thursday night at St. Thomas' Hospital in London. 'I owe them my life.' Johnson, 55, was diagnosed over two weeks ago, becoming the first world leader confirmed to have the illness. His coronavirus symptoms at first were said to have been mild, including a cough and a fever, and he was working from home during the first few days. But he was admitted to St. Thomas' on April 5 after his condition worsened and he was transferred the following day to its intensive care unit, where he received oxygen but was not put onto a ventilator. He spent three nights there before moving back to a regular hospital ward. While he convalesces, Johnson has asked Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab to handle the nation's response to the pandemic that has infected at least 1.78 million worldwide and killed 109,000 people. Experts say those numbers seriously understate the impact of the pandemic, due to limited testing and different ways of counting the dead. Johnson's Conservative government has come under fire for its slow response to confronting the pandemic, as well as a lack of personal protective equipment for medical workers and the slow rollout of a coronavirus testing program. One senior medical official lacerated the government for not acting quickly enough. Britain has been in effective lockdown since March 23 and the government is set to extend the restrictions sometime next week. Figures later Sunday are expected to show that over 10,000 people in the U.K. have died after testing positive for coronavirus. That would make Britain the fourth European country after Italy, Spain and France to reach that grim milestone, even with its limited testing. On Saturday, Britain reported 917 new coronavirus-related deaths, taking the total number of people who have died in the hospital with the virus to 9,875. With Britain's death toll increasing at such a rapid daily pace, and the virus death tolls in Italy and Spain on a downward slope, there are growing fears that the U.K. will end up being the country with the most virus deaths in Europe. The continent has had almost 74,000 reported coronavirus deaths. Last week, the British government's chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, warned that the daily number of deaths would likely increase for a couple more weeks. Britain's business secretary, Alok Sharma, refused to be drawn in on whether the U.K. will end up with the highest death toll in Europe. 'We are at different trajectories,' he said told the BBC. 'We are starting to see these measures work.'

The canals of Venice have emptied of pollutants, with locals claiming the waters are cleaner now than they have been for 60 years. Animals have been reclaiming spaces where humans had driven them out, both on land and at sea. Air pollution worldwide has decreased dramatically as manufacturing has slowed and the world’s commercial airlines have been forced to keep their planes on the ground. With humans dramatically reducing their influence on the environment to stem the spread of COVID-19, nature has been working to tip the balance back more evenly in her favour.
