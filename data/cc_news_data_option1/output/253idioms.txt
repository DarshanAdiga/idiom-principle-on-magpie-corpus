 A listing on the RightMove website shows it listed with an asking price of £150,000.
 Coun Nigel Murphy, deputy leader of Manchester council, said the authority was working with the owner to 'try and find a workable and sustainable future for Hough Hall'.
 He added: "This historic building has been on our register of buildings at risk for a number of years and in that time we have worked closely with its owners to try and find a workable and sustainable future for Hough Hall.
 "Even though the powers we have over such buildings are limited we recognise this is a Grade II listed building in serious decline.

Then, on March 1, the Academy Award-winning "Spirited Away" and six more join the platform. The final seven films, including "Howl's Moving Castle," will debut on April 1.
 American fans aren't out of luck yet. All 21 films will stream on competitor service HBO Max upon its launch in May. At the time, its acquisition marked the first time Studio Ghibli's films were licensed to a streaming platform, the New York Times reported.
 The studio hasn't released a new film since 2014, but it's enjoyed international acclaim since its founding nearly 35 years ago. Its fantastical tales of growing up have attracted a global following -- one both streaming services plan to capitalize on.
 "In this day and age, there are various great ways a film can reach audiences," Studio Ghibli producer Toshio Suzuki said in a statement through Netflix. "We've listened to our fans and have made the definitive decision to stream our film catalog. We hope people around the world will discover the world of Studio Ghibli through this experience."

Jennifer McIntyre is the usual moderator at the Legislative Coffees with the District 24 legislators, this year scheduled for Feb. 1 and Feb. 22.
 McIntyre is also the vice president of the Pierre League of Women Voters, a nonpartisan political organization that encourages informed and active participation in government.
 “To that end, we are starting something new in 2020,” said McIntyre. “Missouri River Roundtable events will occur quarterly, taking a look at a different levels of government, for each inviting three-to-five expert guests. The goal is for attendees to learn about basic processes, as well as how they can both engage in and follow aspects of government that affects their lives.
 On Jan. 4, the League, with the Pierre Area Chamber of Commerce, hosted its first roundtable, focused on state-level government, ahead of the opening of the 94th legislative session.
 “For the first Missouri River Roundtable, we had the following guests,” said McIntyre. “1.) Representative Mary Duvall, who commented on working in the legislature, detailing successful interactions that she has had with citizens; 2.) South Dakota Department of Environment & Natural Resources (DENR) Engineer Kelli Buscher, who talked about her experience testifying before the legislature, giving insight into how citizens can best make their voices heard on specific issues; 3.) Secretary of the Senate Kay (“Boots”) Johnson, who shared her behind-the-scenes experience at the legislature, communicating the typical processes for law-making; and 4.) Legislative Research Council (LRC) Legislative Attorney Matt Frame, who informed attendees about the resources and processes of the LRC, focusing on how people can use the LRC to learn about legislative happenings.”
 Future events will look at city-level and county-level government, as well as exploring other institutions that impact citizens in this region. All of these events are free and open to the public, with snacks and coffee provided to attendees.
 Each event is formatted to have the guests introduce themselves and their part of the process, along with something that they think more citizens should know. The League and Chamber will also have a few discussion topics. However, the bulk of the time will be given to discussion between the guests and attendees.

DULUTH, Minn. (AP) — Striking snowplow drivers in northeastern Minnesota say they've come to terms with St. Louis County on a new contract. Teamsters Local 320 officials Erik Skoog posted on Facebook Monday that an agreement had been reached that \"both parties can be proud of.\" The union went on strike last Wednesday, citing differences over health care and accrued sick leave. Skoog says the tentative agreement was reached after 15 hours of mediation. Union members are expected to vote on the new settlement Monday afternoon in Eveleth. Public Works supervisors and other licensed and qualified staff from other divisions and departments operated the plows during the strike. St. Louis County spokeswoman Dana Kazel said the replacements had 70 percent of the roads plowed by the time they finished on Saturday.
