Tara Smith, a professor of epidemiology at Kent State University, says she's not sure how cruises can protect passengers but still be fun. Pools and dance floors can't be too crowded, for example. Even if ships reduce capacity, droplets can spread between passengers. They could test passengers as they get on board, but they would need to get rapid and accurate results.

_Rick and Morty_ is, by and large, a sitcom. As such it mostly resets whatever changes the characters go through in a season by the start of the next one. We've seen Rick on the verge of suicide before, only to seemingly act like that never happened. Morty had to bury the corpse of an alternate reality version of himself in Season 1, yet that has barely been brought up in the ensuing years. However, Season 4 took the time to add subtle, yet significant changes to the status quo.

We are in a very precarious time in our country’s history. We are teetering on the precipice of falling into socialism or grabbing hold of democracy.
 We seem to have Antifa thugs controlling many of our cities’ streets and killing and destroying many of our businesses and towns. We have socialists who want to take away our rights and control everything we do who are right in our government.
 We have politicians whose families are being funded and supported by foreign countries on the take for America’s goods, services, and information.

Where next for Lallana after this extension is over? He has been heavily linked with a move to Leicester City, where Brendan Rodgers, the man who signed him for Liverpool, is manager. Burnley are also reportedly interested in Lallana, who is clever on the ball, can see a pass and is able to play anywhere across the attacking midfield positions. He would be a very good pick-up for most Premier League clubs, especially as the coronavirus pandemic means that finances will be tight and free agents are highly sought after right now.

Some are wondering, why isn’t Amazing Joe’s in Muncie open? Mike Robinson wrote on Facebook Sunday night, “We've met with our distributor and beef suppliers regularly through zoom meetings, emails, and phone calls trying to come up with solutions and even substitutes for our normal selection of high quality fresh cuts at a price that is affordable for everyone. We just didn't/don't feel any of those options were up to par. No one wants to open the doors back up more than we do. We're no longer thinking in months, but more so in weeks/days as to our reopening. Our teams are ready and waiting.”

Defund the police.
 Those three words have sparked debate about the future of policing in the United States. And it's become a campaign issue ahead of the 2020 elections.
 But there is a misunderstanding about what the slogan means. Does it mean completely cutting funding for police departments? Disbanding police agencies? Depending on which cable news host or politician you listen to, it could mean either one of those things — or something entirely different.
 However, the three-word slogan doesn't tell the full story. Black Lives Matter, which launched the "Defund the Police" effort, posted a petition on its website calling for a national defunding of police and investments in communities "to ensure Black people not only survive, but thrive." The petition does not call for abolishing or dismantling police agencies.

After a big fight with Beth last season, the first episode of Season 4, “Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat,” starts with Rick having to ask Morty for permission before going on an adventure. "There's a way we do this now," Morty’s mom Beth tells her father, and he complies. Later in the season, Beth forces Rick to fulfill a promise to Morty and give him a dragon. Each of these times, Rick is clearly angry, but he agrees because, for the first time in the show's history, he can lose the family he always thought was under his thumb. It's entirely possible that next season will erase everything that happened in the past 10 episodes, but for at least one season, it seemed like _Rick and Morty_ was interested in showing—once and for all—that being a self-righteous jerk does have consequences, and not even Rick can fix all of his problems.
