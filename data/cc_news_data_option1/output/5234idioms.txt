Remember when Skylab was falling? When it was gonna break apart in space and fall back to Earth? Well, I was the kid worried it would somehow, hit my house! Of all the billions of places it could land, I was afraid a chunk of metal from space would hit us! I swear I was.
 How are we going to remember COVID? My "kids" are 18 and 22 now. Are they really affected, other than having to wear these pesky masks? And what, exactly, will they remember. Neither know anyone directly affected. I tell them the stories. I tell them about the schools closing. I tell them about the reports we get from the towns, and the fact that Roxbury Mayor Robert DeFillippo is regularly now reporting an uptick in cases.
 My daughter took the year off - delaying her senior year at college, specifically not to have to deal with it, including the potential exposure and all the chaos that has ensued.
 Every week now, we report on school district after school district literally having to figure things out on the fly, sometimes day to day. But is the type of thing that is going to scar these kids forever?
 My guess is no. Yes, they'll remember the year they saw their teachers and their friends over the computer, but will they remember that some people were actually scared? My guess, again, is no, unless they directly affected.
 Now, is it almost over? That's what they're telling us. Just a few more months.
 And then what? What will we collectively think when we look back on all of this? Will we remember the Zoom calls. Or the ghost town it has made of the movie theaters? and the Rockaway Townsquare Mall. We were there Saturday night. It's about one-quarter as packed as it normally would be. There were about 15 people- besides us- in the theater. I wondered how they are surviving, especially given that Hollywood is "holding back" on the big releases until this all clears.
 Remember when Three Mile Island happened? And we were all afraid there was going to be a literal "nuclear meltdown?" And then President Carter went to visit the Long Island site wearing those little booties on his shoes? Am I the only one who remembers that?
 In the eighth grade, the science teacher at Byram School told us that the planets were all going to align, and the gravitational pull would be so great, it would destroy the Earth. Never happened. Did I worry about it? Yes. Yes I did. Getting the picture here? I'm a lifelong worrier.
 Remember the blizzard of 1978? That's the closest I've come, thus far, in life to opening the front door and seeing a wall of snow. I loved it then. I was 10. Now, I'd hate it. Somehow, it would terrify me.
 Unless we are directly affected by a death of someone from COVID- and many of us are- but many haven't been, how will we remember this a decade from now? We'll remember, most likely, the lockdowns, and the restrictions. And we'll remember thinking at the time - 10 months ago- that we never thought we would ever see something like this in our lifetimes. Never.

Near the entrance of the American University of Beirut (AUB) in the city’s Hamra district, security forces fired tear gas to disperse protesters who were trying to approach the main gate.
 Students responded by throwing water bottles and other objects at riot police blocking their path.
 It was not immediately clear if there were any injuries.
 The protest came in response to a decision by AUB and the Lebanese American University (LAU), another top private institution, to price tuition based on an exchange rate of 3,900 Lebanese pounds to the dollar.
 The nosediving currency is still officially pegged at around 1,500 pounds to the greenback.
 The move has prompted fears that other universities could follow suit, potentially leading to an exodus of students from private institutions while public universities remain underfunded and overstretched.
 Hundreds of students had gathered in Hamra earlier Saturday in a protest they billed a "student day of rage".
 They chanted anti-government slogans and called for affordable education in a country mired in its worst economic crisis since the 1975-1990 civil war.
 Later in the evening, some torched dumpsters to block the street and vandalised banks before security forces pushed them out.
 Over the past year, the Lebanese pound has lost up to 80 percent of its value on the black market, where on Saturday the dollar was selling for at least 8,200 pounds.
 Universities have struggled to adapt to the de facto devaluation as prices nationwide have soared.
 Commercial banks have halted dollar transactions and restricted withdrawals of Lebanese pounds, in moves that have starved many of their savings.

Things may be looking up for Canadian oil, but improving on something as dismal as the condition of our northern neighbors' oil sector doesn't necessarily mean they'll be going gangbusters--it could just mean that they'll be eking out another year with a modicum less of hardship. Wall Street may be feeling bullish about Canadian oil, but Alberta, the province that the Canadian oil sands call home, is hedging its bets and looking toward another fossil fuel as its possible road to salvation.  And no, the answer isn't green energy or the ever-more popular ESG Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance investment trend. In fact, Alberta is headed in the opposite direction, looking to the past for their future. Alberta is betting on, of all things, a "coal rush."  The province, which depends on fossil fuel extraction to power its economy--and, to a considerable extent, the entire Canadian economy--already has eight coal mines currently operating to extract the region's more than 91 billion tonnes of mineable coal. But that number might be about to nearly double--an unusual occurrence in a world that's increasingly moving away from coal mining at a brisk clip. And, ironically, until now Canada has been a more than willing member of the movement to phase out coal, a dirty fuel that is a particularly egregious contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions. As recently as 2015, the Albertan government had pledged to phase out coal-fired electricity altogether by 2030, which was, amazingly, even three years earlier than the Canadian government made the same commitment as part of their cooperation with meeting the goals and benchmarks set by the Paris climate accord. And the very same Canada that's poised for a coal renaissance launched the Powering Past Coal Alliance along with the United Kingdom at the 2017 UN Climate Change Conference. And now, after all Canada has done to place itself at the helm of clean energy leaders around the globe, Alberta is quietly on track to bring back coal. After 44 years of a restrictive coal mining policy designed to protect the drinking water of millions of Albertan residents, the limits have been lifted under a new conservative government eager to ramp up coal production in spite of the province and the nation's anti-coal commitments. The province is now looking at "at least six new or expanded open-pit coal mines built up and down the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains, mostly by Australian companies," The Guardian reported this week. "Together, these projects could industrialize as much as 1,000 sq km of forests, waterways, and grasslands." Related Goldman Turns Bullish On Oil Sees $65 Brent In 2021 How is Alberta planning to make coal, the most demonized fossil fuel which is finally going out of fashion across the board, from the most developed countries to the most impoverished, profitable Well, it actually shouldn't be too hard. While the bottom has fallen out of the market for the kind of coal used in power plants, coking coal also known as metallurgical coal is still in high demand for its integral role in the steelmaking process. Much of this demand comes from China, which produces about half of the world's steel and which will likely keep buying lots and lots of coke as its economy continues to recover post-COVID. While coking coal is more promising economically, however, it's just as damaging to the environment. Steelmaking alone accounts for nearly 5% of the entire world's industrial carbon emissions. The move back to coal has been an understandably controversial one in Alberta. "It's all pretty shocking," Katie Morrison, conservation director of the southern Alberta chapter of the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society told The Guardian. "The government is saying this is going to be the next economic boon for the province, but it's just another boom-and-bust economy. And there's a good chance [the mines] will go bust before they ever clean up their mess, and the public will be left with the clean-up costs." Albertan constituents were not consulted in the repeal of the 1976 coal mining restrictions, and it's likely that there will be plenty of public outcry concerning the at least six new coal mines on the province's docket. If the mines are constructed as planned, it may be a temporary boon for Canada's economy, but it will present an interesting PR complication for a country that has gone so far to brand itself as anti-coal on the world's stage.

At National Stadium, holders Central Punjab will face leaders Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The two teams are enjoying an impressive run of form as they enter the match on the back of three consecutive wins.
 KP, with their last win over Southern Punjab by ten wickets, consolidated their position at the top of the six-team points table and enjoy a 29-point lead over second-placed Northern.
 Their success has been built around solid contributions from Kamran Ghulam and Sajid Khan and their captain Khalid Usman will be hoping that their purple patch stretches into the upcoming round.
 Kamran, a right-handed batsman, leads the chart for the batsmen with most runs this season with 873 runs at an average of over 62. He is the only batsman to date to cross the 800-run mark. All of his three centuries have come in the past three matches.
 Off-spinner Sajid has taken 15 wickets in the last two matches, which include a second innings five-wicket haul against Sindh and a first-innings five- wicket haul against Southern Punjab.
 After remaining at the bottom of the points table for the first half of the tournament, title defenders Central Punjab have staged an astonishing comeback, which has turned them into a formidable force. Their captain Hasan Ali has been at the forefront of the resurgence with 22 wickets and a blistering 50 not out in the three victories.
 Pacer Waqas Maqsood — the leading wicket-taker amongst the pacers with 34 scalps at 20.62 — and Ahmed Safi Abdullah (28 wickets at 24.14) have duly supported their skipper.
 Ali Zaryab became the only Central Punjab batsman this season to register a century and the side will be pinning their hopes on the opener along with Usman Salahuddin, a 30-year-old middle-order batsman, who is the team’s leading run-scorer with 525 runs from eight matches.
 At UBL Sports Complex, second-placed Northern take on Balochistan. Nauman Ali- captained Northern enter the ninth round of the tournament on the back of splendid batting performances by 18-year-old Mubasir Khan and all-rounder Hammad Azam which helped them retain the second spot on the points table and stay in contention for the final spot.
 Northern are certain to derive inspiration from the resilient 294-run alliance which ensured that their eighth round fixture against Sindh ended in a draw as Mubasir registered a valiant 164 on debut and Hammad, the tournament’s second best run-scorer, scored his second century of the season.
 Nauman, himself, remains their primary bowling weapon. With 55 wickets, which include five five-fers, he is the leading wicket-taker in the season.
 Over the course of the last two rounds, Balochistan have slipped to the bottom of the points table from the fourth spot. After finishing the last season at the bottom of the points table, they will be hoping for a change of fortune starting this fixture. Since their win in the opening match, Balochistan have lost four and drawn three.
 Left-arm spinner Jalat Khan is their leading wicket-taker with 24 dismissals, while Akbar-ur-Rehman has been their chief accumulator of runs as the 37-year- old has made 481 runs from six matches.
 At SBP Ground, Sindh will lock horns with Southern Punjab. Asad Shafiq-led Sindh started the last day of the previous round as favourites to win their second match of the season only to be denied by the gutsy knocks from Northern’s Mubasir and Hammad.
 The draw helped them climb one spot to number five, but it is the crucial 16 points for win which they will be hoping to bag when their fixture against Southern Punjab begins.
 Saud Shakeel continues to have an impressive run with the bat as the 25-year- old has piled up 738 runs — third most in the season.
 Sindh’s batting unit has been bolstered by the return to form of Sharjeel Khan, seventh in the list of the highest run-getters, and Asad. Since earning a promotion in the First XI team, Shahnawaz Dhani has produced brilliant bowling spells, grabbing 20 wickets at 30.35 in five matches. The 22-year-old is yet to record a five-fer at the first-class level, something he will be hoping to check in the upcoming match.
 Southern Punjab were at the end of a 10-wicket pounding from table-toppers Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in their last outing. They were forced to follow-on after which they just managed to avoid an innings defeat.
 Leggie Zahid Mahmood, however, continued to live up to the expectations as he returned yet another five-wicket haul with six for 163. The 32-year-old Dadu- born, who has the third-most scalps this season, will continue to spearhead his team’s bowling attack.
 Defiant fifties from Aamer Yamin (first innings 93) and Mohammad Umair (second innings 77) promise support for Salman Ali Agha, who is their team’s top- scorer with 716 runs at just under 60.

Remember when we got through the Iran Hostage crisis? I remember even as a kid in 1979 worrying about the fate of those Americans.
 Remember the black out in New York City in 1977? And worrying that the looting and ensuing madness would somehow affect us, all the way out here in the burbs? I remember that too.
 Remember worrying about nuclear war with Russia?
 And then Hurricane Sandy? And no gas? and no power. Parts of Roxbury and Harding- just to name two- were out for weeks. Weeks. Now that was scary. That was worse then this, right?
 It's hard go gauge. Is wearing the masks enough? I haven't been a shrinking violet for the past 10 months. I go out often. To the stores, to the post office, to the theater, out to eat once in a while. And I'm not afraid while I'm there. But some are. And again, how will we remember this?
 See, these things stick with me. That's not to say they terrorize me anymore, although they might have at the time.
 This COVID business hasn't terrified me, but I know it has some.
 I just kind of move around it, or despite it, refusing to sit at home and hide in terror. Yet, I certainly comply with the masks, and agree with the need.
 I just wonder how this will all shake out in the end.
 What will we think? Will it be "The Year We All Wore Masks?" Sadly, for many, the losses will be recalled. But, that won't be the overall memory, I don't think.
 "The Year We All Learned to Use Zoom?"
 Will we all laugh and say "Yeah, remember that?"
 Ninety nine percent of us, of course, will still be here when it officially ends. But, how, exactly, will we look back on this strange and unique year?
 This too shall pass? Almost certainly. It took almost a year. And it might be a full year before it's "normal" again. Imagine normal again? Won't it feel weird not to put that mask on before you walk out the door? Think about it.

Brunel was charged with rape of minors over the age of 15 and sexual harassment, said a statement from the prosecutors’ office. He was initially detained on Wednesday at Paris Charles de Gaulle airport as he was about to board a flight to Senegal.
 Epstein, who was arrested in New York in July 2019 on charges of trafficking underage girls for sex, was found hanged in his New York jail cell the following month while awaiting trial over abuses involving girls at his Palm Beach home and on his private island in the Caribbean.
 His ownership of an apartment in an upmarket Paris district and allegations from women who say they were abused in France prompted French prosecutors to open their own investigation.
 That probe has focused on Brunel, who has been accused in American court documents of rape and of procuring young girls for his friend.
 "This is what the victims have been waiting for for many years, some of them for more than 30 years," said Anne-Claire Lejeune, a lawyer for several of the women.
 The prosecutor’s decision to charge him "gives meaning to what they have been saying for all these years," she added.
 Now in his 70s, Brunel began his career as a model scout who in 1978 was involved in setting up the prestigious Karin Models agency.
 He then moved to the United States where he co-founded the Miami-based agency MC2.
 Brunel’s lawyer in October 2019 said he vehemently rejected allegations made in the press, but denied his client was on the run, insisting he was available for questioning.
 French police last year raided the offices of Karin Models and searched Epstein’s luxury Paris home not far from the Arc de Triomphe.
 In US court documents, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, a key plaintiff against Epstein, accused the American tycoon of using her as a "sex slave" and said she had been forced to have sex with well-known politicians and businessmen, including Brunel.
 She also alleged that Brunel would bring girls as young as 12 to the United States and pass them on to his friends, including Epstein.
 These claims prompted a rare statement by Brunel in 2015 that itself broke years of silence in which he vehemently denied involvement, "directly or indirectly", in Epstein’s crimes. Long before the Epstein scandal broke, Brunel was accused of rape by several models in a 1988 documentary by CBS.

Further complicating matters, the different priority groups discussed by the CDC committee are overlapping; many essential workers have high-risk conditions, and some are older than 65. Some states have suggested that they will prioritize only essential workers who come face to face with the public, while others have not prioritized them at all.

When Carroll's other daughter tested positive for the coronavirus, state health officials told her to notify anyone her daughter might have been around. Contact tracers, she was told, were simply too overwhelmed to do it. It's the same story across the U.S., as a catastrophic surge in infections has made it difficult or impossible to keep up with the calls considered critical to controlling outbreaks.

also, I am not going to look it up, but weeks ago I posted on how the CDC had basically said fuck you to the Trump White House and its staff and had started working more as if Biden was already president. This is also exactly why you are seeing Fauci speak again a lot in public, for a while there he just went off to a hidey hole somewhere, but he's back now. I have seen lots of evidence that even the Surgeon General appears to be on board with them all.
