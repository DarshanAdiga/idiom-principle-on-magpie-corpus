The case though is emblematic of the inherent conflicts of interest in the canon law system, where Jarzembowski's allegations were initially quashed after bishops declared them unfounded.

I can’t remember what officers were being paid as hazard allowance then but it was a pitiable pittance, while politicians were feasting on billions of naira. Have you ever gone to report a case at a police station and you are asked to “mobilise” officers to for investigation? This is the back story: there are hardly any funds made available for investigation. An officer told me some years ago that he had to be transporting suspects to court from his own pocket. Many suspects rot in police cells for this reason. A police officer confided in me that he resorted to drinking dry gin and smoking marijuana anytime he was on night duty to gain “Dutch courage”. He often felt vulnerable.

The move backfired, especially when Russell Wilson converted two fourth downs on the game-winning drive for the Seahawks. Seattle became the second team in the past four seasons to convert two fourth downs on a game-winning drive that overcame a deficit in the final five minutes of a game, joining the Bengals, who did it against Atlanta in 2018.

“You think we don’t know they extort motorists?” a very, very senior police officer told me. “We just look the other way because we don’t give them money for fuel.” Guess what happened to the fuel budget. Officers were being transferred without plans for accommodation and without getting their allowances. I was at the Pen Cinema police station, Agege, Lagos, one morning and saw policemen sleeping inside a van. One officer told me: “They were transferred from Enugu last month. There was no plan for accommodation, so they sleep inside patrol van, wake up very early in the morning to have their bath, and they have to go on patrol without funds being provided for fuel.”

To push negotiators toward that slim area of possible common ground, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will have a video call with Johnson later Wednesday. Few expect Johnson to pull the plug on the negotiations this week, and instead commit to talks for a few more weeks.

FRANKLIN -- Franklin Town Council candidate Cobi Frongillo on Monday applied action to his values, bringing his group of local volunteers out to the Southern New England Trunkline Trail (SNETT).
 "I've been amazed by the support we've received from the community, particularly all the Franklin High School students that are heading onto our website to join in the effort," said Frongillo, who also gathered more than double the required signatures to get on the ballot. "We're excited to build off the momentum of this summer and election season to draw new voices into the town dialogue."
 The Frongillo for Franklin campaign team and its volunteers joined the Franklin and Bellingham Rail Trail Committee (FBRTC) for their monthly group walk of the trail. Honoring Indigenous Peoples' Day, Frongillo kicked off the event by taking a moment to acknowledge that the group was walking on the lands of the Wampanoag people. The candidate answered constituents' questions while the group was guided along the trail by a FBRTC volunteer.
 This October, FBRTC added a StoryWalk, launched their first ever photo contest, set up signage to highlight the trail's foliage, and promoted the opening of the Prospect Street tunnel. Learn more about their initiatives at ​franklinbellinghamrailtrail.org​.
 "It is important that we are being responsible and taking care of our natural resources," said Frongillo. "I'm glad we could get a group of people out here helping the incredible Franklin and Bellingham Rail Trail Committee with their clean up and promotion efforts this month."

Fellow Nigerians, you can now imagine what would happen when you unleash these bitter, desperate, frustrated, ill-trained, cheated, demoralised, disoriented and dehumanised human beings on the society — and then give them guns, to boot. You ask them to police people who look successful, respected and well- nourished, people who treat them with disdain and suspicion. For clarity, I am not making any excuses for their impunity. Poor training and operational conditions do not excuse the insanity. But my point is: in the end, we are getting the kind of police that we breed. The foundation is faulty. A police officer will always be a police officer, no matter the unit or station.
