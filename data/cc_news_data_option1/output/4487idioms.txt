Corsairs, filibusters, swashbucklers, buccaneers, renegades: the rich lexicon of piracy in our vocabulary of rebellion attests the role they have long played in the collective imagination. But there is a complex history from which they sprang on onto the global stage. The rise of the pirate as a dangerously desirable figure is intimately linked to the maritime expansion conducted by several European nations in the early modern period, that coalesced into the creation of Empires and colonies through which European powers came to dominate world history by the 19th century. This module reads against the grain of those dominant narratives of colonialism as world-making by focusing on the pirate as an interruptive force, who derails the movement of peoples, goods, ideas, and laws across the maritime routes linking the Atlantic and Indian Ocean worlds. Important tools in the module will be the reading practices of postcolonial theory, which will teach us to extract and assess this alternative history of the post/colonial pirate.

Lines eased off in the afternoon, but many polling places, including those in Laconia, Gilford and Meredith, reported long lines when they opened at 7 a.m.
 After voting at the Gilford Youth Center, Ernest Goodwin stopped for a moment in chilly, breezy weather on his way to his car.
 “This election is important because of what’s going on, the economy and the COVID epidemic,” said Goodwin. “I don’t think Biden can last four years, and I think Trump did the best that could be done on the pandemic. Nobody could have done better.”
 Nearby, Sarah Snow was also getting into a car after voting.
 “We have to vote for Trump,” she said. “We have to get rid of this lockdown. It’s ridiculous.”
 Inside the polling place, Gilford Town Clerk Danielle LaFond, said that at 6:30 a.m. the line of people waiting to vote extended into the parking lot, and by 7 a.m., it stretched down the road.
 In Meredith, Town Clerk Kerri Parker also reported morning crowds.
 She said that even if in-person turnout is the same this year as it was four years ago, there will still be many more total votes.
 “We are at like 1,600 absentee ballots and we only had 600 last time,” she said.
 The New Hampshire Secretary of State’s office said Tuesday that there had been 249,658 requests for absentee ballots statewide — more than three times as many as four years ago — and 235,834 of those ballots had been returned.
 In 2016, a record 755,850 New Hampshire residents voted in the presidential election, narrowly favoring Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump.

It was not clear what Trump meant by saying he would ask the Supreme Court to halt "voting." However, legal experts have said the election outcome could get bogged down in state-by-state litigation over a host of issues, including whether states can include late-arriving ballots that were mailed by Election Day.
 Even before Tuesday, the 2020 campaign saw a historic number of lawsuits across dozens of states, as the coronavirus pandemic forced election officials to prepare for an election like no other. Both campaigns have marshaled teams of lawyers in preparation for any disputes.
 Ahead of the election, Trump had said he wanted his latest U.S. Supreme Court appointee, Amy Coney Barrett, confirmed by the Senate in case the court had to hear any electoral dispute. Democrats had criticized the president for appearing to suggest he expected Barrett to rule in his favor.
 Trump has repeatedly said without evidence that widespread mail-in voting will lead to fraud, although U.S. election experts say fraud is vanishingly rare.
 In Pennsylvania, Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf said the state still had to count more than a million mail-in ballots and called Trump's remarks a partisan attack. According to Edison Research, more than 2.4 million early ballots were cast in the state, with 1.6 million by registered Democrats and about 555,000 by Republicans.
 The next president will lead a nation battered by a pandemic that has killed more than 231,000 people and left millions more jobless, as well as racial tensions and political polarization that has only worsened during a vitriolic campaign.
 The election will also decide which party controls the U.S. Congress for the next two years, and the Democratic drive to win control of the Senate appeared to fall short. Democrats picked up only one Republican-held seat while six other races remained undecided - Alaska, Maine, Michigan, North Carolina and two in Georgia.
 ## Latino problem for Biden
 Trump's strong performance in Florida, a must-win state for his reelection, was powered by his improved numbers with Latinos.
 For months there had been complaints from Democratic Latino activists that Biden was ignoring Hispanic voters and lavishing attention instead on Black voters in big Midwestern cities. Opinion polls in key states showed Biden underperforming with Latinos in the weeks leading up to the election.
 Edison's national exit poll showed that while Biden led Trump among nonwhite voters, Trump received a slightly higher proportion of the nonwhite votes than he did in 2016. The poll showed that about 11% of African Americans, 31% of Hispanics and 30% of Asian Americans voted for Trump, up 3 percentage points from 2016 in all three groups.
