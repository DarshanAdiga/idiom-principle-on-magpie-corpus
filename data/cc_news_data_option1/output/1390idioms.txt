_VALORANT_ ’s beta release this week has been a perfect storm of viewership stimulation, but many of the factors that went into making it hugely successful on its opening day won’t be reliable ways for the game to attract viewers long term.
 Twitch drops, the COVID-19 pandemic, and Riot’s status as a top developer making a new game all mixed together perfectly, making an explosively potent viewership-boosting cocktail.
 For starters, the top developers in the industry have a history of consistently attracting viewers for a Twitch debut. Last year, Electronic Arts’ _Apex Legends_ release in February generated more than 30 million hours watched multiple weeks in a row, something most games fail to do even once in a year.
 While _Apex_ was able to ride its initial success for more than a month, viewership eventually dipped back down when hype for the game subsided and other competing games in its genre, like _Fortnite_ , released more content.
 In the same vein, Twitch drops play an important role in driving viewership—and we’re not talking about some of the basic skins and cosmetics that are regularly available across a plethora of games with Twitch Prime.
 Making _VALORANT_ ’s beta accessible to the public exclusively from watching content creators on Twitch is perhaps the game’s most significant driving force for viewership. Not only are people who may otherwise not watch Twitch logging in, but many people are even making multiple accounts and watching multiple streams on a handful of devices in an attempt to get whitelisted for beta access.
 The key here is that the game, which is being hyped up by the gaming community, is only accessible by watching Twitch. One of the closest similarities we can make to this is from Twitch and _Escape from Tarkov_ ’s New Year’s drop event.
 While people didn’t need to watch Twitch to play _EFT_ , Twitch’s drop event for the game gave viewers tangible, beneficial items in-game that weren’t strictly a cosmetic boost. Instead of a game being “pay-to-win,” the event effectively made _EFT_ “watch-to-win.” Riot’s move of making the beta accessible via a Twitch drop essentially took _EFT_ ’s event to another level.
 But for _EFT_ , the Twitch drop event could only help the game so much. Eventually, the title’s viewership dipped back down to more moderate figures. After opening the year with 30 million hours watched, the game’s viewership was cut to less than half of that just week’s after.
 For a game like _EFT_ that's been around for a while, that short-term boost in viewership can lead to a residual imprint on some viewers helping the game mingle around the upper echelon of titles on Twitch. But for a new, highly- publicized game made by a gaming goliath like Riot, that initial boost is even more powerful.
 Lastly, one element to _VALORANT_ ’s viewership that maybe isn’t being given as much attention is the fact that more people are watching Twitch. With the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic keeping people in their houses and postponing all of traditional sports’ major leagues, the masses have been increasingly drawn to Twitch to find entertainment.
 In the first quarter of the year, Twitch reached an all-time high in hours watched and average viewership, according to Streamlabs and Stream Hatchet’s quarterly report. It’s only natural that a massive event in gaming during a time like this would further boost its reach to record-level numbers.
 Are all of these things good or bad for _VALORANT’s_ long-term health on Twitch?
 Speculating _VALORANT_ ’s future isn’t easy. The game certainly has a foundation that could propel it to starting a new era on Twitch. But, at the same time, the current hype surrounding its initial audience figures could serve to create unrealistic expectations moving forward that could hurt the game’s potential.
 While fans watch streamers like Summit1g and TimTheTatman waiting endlessly in hopes of getting access to the _VALORANT_ beta, it’s important to check your expectations for the game. If they don’t, they might end up being disappointed down the road.

Then, Chris was asked if he thinks Barbara Weber--who has historically been critical of Peter's choice of women--would give the green light on Peter and Kelley's potential relationship. "I know Barb would approve, because Barb was kind of starstruck when she met Kelley at the _After the Final Rose_ special, so it's Barb approved, it's Peter approved, it's Bachelor Nation approved," he said. "In all seriousness, they had this great chemistry even when they met before the show. The show just wasn't right for them. The show wasn't right for Kelley and it didn't help them foster that relationship, so maybe, just maybe his love story is not done." Iiiiiiinteresting!

Threat of COVID-19 along with curfew has thrown life out of gear for most of the people. While majority of them remain indoors, it has brought more responsibility to the police. They have to be out on roads to enforce curfew, enable availability of essential goods and help people maintain personal distance. These are the most trying times as police personnel need to take care of their health too.


  But Madurai City Police have not only realized their duties and responsibilities but also their well-being.


  Instead of the usual day-long slogging at police stations or on roads for most of the officers and men, they have drafted new working hours for the lockdown period. As per the new schedule, officers and men work only eight hours, that too in two shifts.


  The first shift starts at 6 a.m. and ends at 10 a.m. Another batch of men work between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. Those in the early morning shift come again for the 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. shift and the second batch works between 6 p.m. to 10 p.m.


  “While one-third of the strength is being given rest for a week on rotation as part of keeping them in quarantine as a precautionary measure, some skeletal staff get night duty,” Commissioner of Police S. Davidson Devasirvatham said.


  All the changes in working pattern is possible as the police do not have court duties, investigation and petition hearing these days. After the roll call at 7 a.m., Inspectors used to have meetings either at offices of ACs or Deputy Commissioners of Police in the mornings. The petition enquiry that starts around 11 a.m. goes on till 2 p.m. or 3 p.m. “Immaterial of the time of taking a break for lunch, all officers have to return for duty at 5 p.m. for evening rounds and the work gets dragged invariably up to 11 p.m.,” a city Inspector of Police said.


  All men and officers up to the rank of Assistant Commissioner are happy about the new pattern of work, says the Commissioner.


  “With the lockdown, all family members are at home. And spending some quality time with them gives us all energy to work non-stop for the next four hours,” the Inspector said.


  Though there are no public meetings, processions and protests in the curfew period, the police are facing a different task.


  “We have to enforce curfew - ensure that shops for essential goods remain open only during stipulated time. We need to create awareness among people to remain indoors, maintain social distance. We do vehicle check, seize vehicles, book cases against violators of curfew,” another officer said.


  While only one Inspector of the station, either Law and Order or Crime, is on duty in a shift, for stations under newly added areas of the city with single Inspector, and additional Inspector has been deputed.


  “Police are talking about social distancing but our men cannot avoid touching others when they do not listen to our instructions. How else can we deal with people who are bent upon violating rules,” a policeman asks.


  The policemen and officials do their work risking their lives too. “We need to take lot of pain like washing our clothes and taking a bath every time we return home after duty to safeguard our family members from infection,” a police officer said.


  However, with the number of COVID-19 positive cases increasing, the number of people complying with the curfew has gone up.


  The added advantage of the curfew is that they do not get calls regarding family quarrels due to closure of TASMAC shops. Similarly, no case of theft is reported as all houses have people round the clock. With fewer vehicles on the road, number of accidents too has come down.


  Mr. Davidson said that the top priority has been given to keep people indoors. “We have been straining every nerve to make all essential goods available at all places, including door delivery, so that people need not come out,” he said.


  Besides ensuring equitable distribution of work among the police personnel, the Commissioner has encouraged their men to come up with innovative ideas to make people aware of the dangers of COVID-19.


  He appreciated Sub-Inspectors of Police, Sivaramakrishnan of Teppakulam and Thiagapriyan of Sellur for organising various competitions for children and street plays.

When it comes to the education level needed to build a career in the ag sector, it ranges from two-year degrees at a community college to a four-year degree from a college or university, depending on the career path you take. Trade schools are another route to go. There are even industries that will help out with the cost of schooling to get young people into their business.
 The Iowa-Nebraska Equipment Dealers Association has been offering to help students with the cost of education for over a decade. Will Rogers is the director of government affairs and education for the association. He said 2020 will be the 13th year they’ve offered the Andrew Goodman Scholarship.
 “It’s a matching scholarship,” he said. “For every dollar a dealership puts in to help sponsor a student, we’ll put in two dollars, up to a total of $2,000. It’s a renewable scholarship for any student a dealership wants to sponsor.”
 About 80% of the scholarship applicants are going to a technical school, but that’s not a requirement, he said. Many applicants are community college students.
 The scholarships can be used to study everything from mechanical repair to agricultural business. Over the years, the association has awarded a total of 321 scholarships and approximately $650,000 of tuition assistance between the dealerships and the association.
 “The money can be used for tuition, room and board, books, as well as basically anything they have to write a check for out of their account,” Rogers said.
 Many community college students need tools for class, and they can cost up to $3,000. It’s one of the few things the school doesn’t provide and one many typical scholarships don’t cover.
 “This one helps them fill that need,” Rogers said.
 AgCareers.com takes a close look at the educational requirements for the many careers they offer. The business-level careers will require a four-year degree.
 “The demand for skilled workers in the trades, as well as the production side of things, is huge,” Osmundson said.
 Those types of roles don’t always require a four-year degree, she said. Many jobs require a two-year associate-level degree or certificate of some type.
 “I think there’s plenty of opportunity for young people out there, regardless of what their education level looks like,” she said.

DUBAI/LONDON -- The world's top crude oil producers Saudi Arabia, Russia and the United States remained at odds on Wednesday over how to shore up global crude prices hammered by the coronavirus crisis and a price war, as meetings on the topic loomed this week.


  The tensions have raised the chances that global oil nations will again fail to reach a lasting agreement to tighten the spigots as a glut in supply threatens to overwhelm storage tanks and tip drilling companies into bankruptcy.


  Saudi Arabia and Russia have signaled they could agree to cuts but only if the United States and others outside a group known as OPEC+ chip in. Washington has repeatedly pushed back saying U.S. drillers have already reduced output for economic reasons, and that it had no plans to orchestrate further cuts.


  U.S. lawmakers, meanwhile, have threatened Saudi Arabia with legislation that would pull economic and military support for the kingdom if it does not stabilize oil prices.


  Asked if a natural decline in U.S. oil output due to weak oil prices could count as a contribution to global production cuts, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: "These are absolutely different reductions."


  The idea that the United States could cooperate with OPEC and others to fix global prices was once unthinkable, but has now become a live point of debate after a decade-long drilling boom turned it into the world's biggest oil and gas supplier.


  While U.S. antitrust law prevents oil producers in the United States from colluding to prop up prices, it does not prevent state regulators or the federal government from ordering lower production levels, according to legal experts.


  But U.S. President Donald Trump has been reluctant. He said last week that a deal he had brokered with Saudi Arabia and Russia could lead to cuts of as much as 10 million to 15 million barrels per day or 10%-15% of global supplies, an unprecedented level, but that Washington made no concessions in return.


  He added this week that OPEC+ had never asked him to order U.S. cuts, "so we'll see what happens."


  Helping the once-bustling U.S. drilling industry weather the market meltdown is a high priority for Trump in an election year, and his administration has eased environmental enforcement and sought ways to expand credit to hard-hit producers.


  OPEC+, which includes the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other producers, is scheduled to hold a meeting on Thursday by a video conference.


  Energy ministers from the Group of 20 nations (G20) will then meet on Friday.


  Riyadh has yet to publicly indicate any agreement on the level of any reductions or how to distribute them. Sources close to OPEC have said there will be no deal without a U.S. cut.


  Russia is ready to cut its oil output by 1.6 million barrels per day, according to a TASS news agency report citing an unnamed Energy Ministry official on Wednesday. A spokeswoman for the ministry said Russia was ready to participate in a deal alongside other countries.


  A previous agreement by OPEC+ to cut production this year fell apart because of a dispute between Russia and Saudi Arabia, triggering a price war that brought a flood of supply just as demand for fuel was crushed by the coronavirus pandemic.


  WHAT'S THE BASELINE?


  Another point of contention in the coming talks is that Moscow, Riyadh and others need to agree on the baseline against which to calculate new cuts, an issue muddied since last month's acrimonious OPEC+ meeting in Vienna.


  Saudi Arabia ramped up output to a record 12.3 million bpd in April, from below 10 million bpd in March.


  OPEC sources said Riyadh wanted any cuts calculated from April levels. But Russia has said cuts should be based on first-quarter levels.


  "The issue is still the baseline," an OPEC source said.


  Iran, which was exempted from the previous OPEC+ deal, has argued the meetings are premature. It believes details such as the baseline and the contributions by the United States and others should have been agreed beforehand.


  Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh warned that, "in the absence of any clear and consensual outcome," a failure of talks could "aggravate the current low- price environment even further."


  Oil prices, which fell to their lowest in almost two decades in March, are still trading at half their level from the end of 2019, before the coronavirus crisis prompted governments to tell people to stay home and fuel demand plummeted.


  The pressure is being felt in the United States.


  The U.S. Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday that oil output dropped 600,000 barrels per day last week. Its longer-term projections show U.S. oil output averaging 11 million bpd in 2021, which correlates to about a 2 million-bpd decline from the late 2019 peak.


  A group of Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives told Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Wednesday that economic and military cooperation between the two countries is in jeopardy unless the kingdom helps to stabilize oil prices by cutting crude output.


  "If the Kingdom fails to act fairly to reverse this manufactured energy crisis, we would encourage any reciprocal responses that the U.S. government deems appropriate," said a letter to the crown prince signed by nearly 50 Republican U.S. Representatives.


  Senate Republicans introduced a bill in March to remove U.S. troops, missiles and defense systems from the kingdom if it does not cut output.


  Saudi Arabia's national shipping firm, Bahri, has provisionally chartered at least a dozen supertankers, each capable of carrying about 2 million barrels of crude, to the U.S. Gulf Coast in coming weeks, according to Refinitiv Eikon data and shipping sources.

Simmons joined the Seahawks in September, 2018 off waivers from the Raiders and ended up making three starts that season.
 In his first two starts at right guard in place of D.J. Fluker the Seahawks had their two highest-rushing totals of the season -- 273 yards against the Rams and 214 yards against the Vikings -- compelling offensive line coach Mike Solari to say "we're excited about him," and raising the idea he could compete for a starting role in 2019.
 However, Simmons battled a knee issue throughout last offseason and was placed on IR in August to have surgery.
 Simmons also battled knee issues in his career at USC, limited to just 21 games and two starts.
 But assuming he is healthy in 2020 he figures to be thrown into the competition at guard, and specifically at left guard which is vacant after the Seahawks did not re-sign last year's starter, Mike Iupati.
 Seattle also signed free agent B.J. Finney to potentially fill that role but he could also be a factor at center where Justin Britt is recovering from an ACL injury and also has been the subject of conjecture that the team could look to release him to save $8.5 million against the salary cap (the Seahawks could also redo Britt's deal to spread out the cap hit to future years).
 Jacksonville on Wednesday also made official the signing of defensive tackle Al Woods, who spent last season with the Seahawks.
 According to OvertheCap.com, Woods will qualify as a free agent loss for Seattle in determining potential compensatory picks for the 2021 NFL draft. But at the moment, Seattle does not have enough free agent losses to offset its free agent gains to qualify for picks. Seattle, though, could potentially still qualify for picks if, say, Jadeveon Clowney and another free agent or two sign with other teams.

Nautilus Inc on Wednesday forecast higher sales for the first quarter, as the coronavirus-driven stay-at-home boosted demand for its exercise equipment.


  Shares of the company, which competes with Peloton Interactive Inc, surged 30% in extended trading.


  Nautilus said it expects first-quarter net sales to rise 11% from a year earlier to $94 million, the first increase in more than a year, as people turn to at-home exercise equipment because of restrictions on movement.


  "Demand for many of our home-fitness products continues to outpace supply and we are pulling all levers to accelerate the manufacturing and delivery of key products," Chief Executive Officer Jim Barr said.


  The company said it expects its retail segment to grow 24% in the quarter as e-commerce sales and curbside pick-up facilities outweigh the impact of stores being shut.


  Factory workers in China, where a significant volume of Nautilus' products are manufactured, and the coronavirus originated, have returned to work and transportation from the country is improving, the company said.


  It added it now expects earnings before interest, tax, deprecation and amortization for the quarter to be between break even and $1.5 million.


  Striking a cautious note, Barr said "the coming quarters may present added challenges for all businesses as we better understand the longer-term impacts of COVID-19."

Faced with an accelerating health crisis centered around the coronavirus outbreak, U.S. Federal Reserve officials last month agreed they needed a pull- out-all-the-stops effort to blunt an economic meltdown as they struggled to comprehend the depth and scope of the risks faced by the world's largest economy.


  In the first detailed account of how the U.S. central bank decided to launch an historic economic rescue plan, minutes of the Fed's emergency meetings in March showed policymakers trying to stay ahead of the rapidly spreading coronavirus pandemic with decisions that may shape the global economy for decades to come.


  There was little disagreement over the policy choices, the minutes reflected, and little argument over the near-term fallout in terms of rising U.S. unemployment, collapsing consumer confidence, and the devastating blow to business.


  But policymakers at the March 3 and 15th emergency meetings also displayed widespread uncertainty about what was to come, and a certain helplessness over a situation where the actions of health officials and elected leaders would be more central to the economy's future.


  Just weeks before, they were overseeing historic lows for unemployment and historic highs for stocks. Now they were plugging holes in "deteriorating" financial markets and having difficulty seeing what might happen even a few weeks ahead.


  Policymakers offered "several alternative scenarios" for the economy, the minutes said, suggesting the world's most powerful central bank was struggling alongside everyone else to glean whether the U.S. economy's sudden stop would soon give way to a fast, "V-shaped" rebound, or cause more chronic, long-term damage.


  "Participants prominently cited the possibility of the virus outbreak becoming more widespread than expected … with adverse implications for the production of goods and services and for aggregate demand," the minutes stated. "Participants stressed that measures taken in the areas of health care policy and fiscal policy … would be important in shaping the timing and speed of the U.S. economy's return to normal."


  The reaction was swift as Fed Chair Jerome Powell convened the emergency sessions. Policymakers agreed to slash interest rates back to zero, broaden access to U.S. dollars for foreign central banks, and restart the massive asset purchases that have come to define monetary policy in a crisis. The first rate cut was announced on March 3 following a videoconference begun on the evening of March 2.


  According to a Reuters tally, the United States has recorded more than 417,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus, and more than 14,000 deaths.


  The rush of activity by the Fed actually began with an unscheduled statement from Powell released on Friday, Feb. 28, as stock markets were cratering, risk premiums on corporate bonds were widening dramatically and the U.S. Treasuries market was being whipsawed by deep illiquidity. Powell pledged that the Fed would "act as appropriate" to support the economy.


  The following Monday evening, on March 2, Powell convened a videoconference with fellow policymakers at which Fed staff told them financial markets had taken the Fed chief's statement as an indication the central bank would cut interest rates at or before its scheduled March 17-18 policy meeting.


  Fed staff spoke of scenarios in which a widening of the coronavirus outbreak and more severe social-distancing actions to curb its spread "would be associated with a greater shutdown of production and disruption of supply chains, larger negative effects on consumer and business sentiment, more significant increases in unemployment, and worsening financial conditions."


  The Fed's policy-setting committee then agreed unanimously to cut the central bank's overnight benchmark lending rate by half a percentage point to a range of 1.00% to 1.25%.


  BACK IN THE FRAY


  Fed officials were forced back onto the front lines less than two weeks later after several large states, including California and New York, announced broad-based closures of all but "essential" businesses and government agencies to ensure that social-distancing mandates were abided by.


  At a videoconference convened on the morning of Sunday, March 15, policymakers noted "that the measures -- such as social distancing -- taken in response to the pandemic, while needed to contain the outbreak, would nevertheless take a toll on U.S. economic activity in the near term."


  There was lengthy debate about just how long the disruption would last and no clear consensus reached on that point.


  In the end, policymakers agreed to cut interest rates a full point back to near zero and restart buying bonds on a massive scale to restore order to the markets for Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities.


  Not all Fed policymakers were on board with the big reduction in borrowing costs, however.


  A few participants wanted to hold fire "to allow fiscal and public health policy responses to the coronavirus outbreak to take hold," preserving further action for use if still required at that point, the minutes showed. They also worried about conveying a "negative signal" about the economic outlook.


  In the end, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester was the only dissent among the rate-setting panel's 10 voters.


  "It seems as if the FOMC was pretty much in unison behind the broader decisions they've made," said Kevin Flanagan, head of fixed income strategy at WisdomTree Asset Management in New York.


  U.S. stocks extended gains to close higher and Treasury yields were mixed after the release of the minutes, which cast light on the speed with which Fed policymakers were pressed into launching an historically forceful response to the damage the outbreak and the efforts to contain it were inflicting on the U.S. economy.


  Barely five weeks before the surprise rate cut announced on March 3, Powell and his colleagues had wrapped up their first policy meeting of the year with an air of cautious optimism. It looked like 2020 could be a year of steady growth and continued strength in the job market, a fresh updraft after a rocky 2019 in which the Fed cut rates three times to blunt the effects of the Trump administration's trade war with China.


  Minutes of that meeting included just eight references to "coronavirus," and seven of those came from the staff briefings. Policymakers referenced coronavirus almost in passing as something that "warranted close watching," according to minutes of that meeting.


  In contrast, minutes of the two videoconferences in March referenced the outbreak 35 times.


  Powell may shed more light on the Fed's assessment of the still-unfolding crisis in a live webcast on Thursday. Hosted by the Brookings Institution in Washington, Powell will deliver prepared remarks at 10 a.m. EDT (1400 GMT) and then participate in a virtual question-and-answer session.

Last year, September rains delayed harvest activities in parts of the Corn Belt and Midwest region and an October blizzard severely restricted harvest in North Dakota. USDA’s annual December survey estimated that 8% of the U.S. corn crop went unharvested in 2019, compared to an average of 1.4% during the previous three years.
 “Growers in affected areas may find they’ll need more agronomic services and support than usual this year just to get caught up,” said Zuckerberg. “Additionally, their farm machinery and equipment will need to be up and running for the heavy workload to come.”
 Despite 2019’s difficulties, USDA reported that consolidated net farm income totaled $93.6 billion, up 12% versus $83.8 billion in 2018. Although that included nearly $24 billion of support provided through various USDA farm subsidy programs, including market facilitation payments in 2018 and 2019.
 One risk factor that’s difficult to quantify at this juncture is COVID-19, which could potentially derail input supply chains and grain export activities both due to logistical bottlenecks as well as a strong U.S. dollar.

And, Draper adds, much of K-State’s agricultural research affects production on the farm, which ultimately affects profitability of farmers and communities.
 “Beyond the production work, there is basic research occurring that provides the foundation for some of the applied advances that will come in three, five, 10 or maybe 20 years down the road,” he said. “If we don’t do that basic research, our advances in production and profitability…will be too slow to keep up with the demands of a growing population and a growing economy.”
 Draper said K-State has cut back on operations in many labs in order to meet social distancing requirements. “We need to make sure we have at least that six feet of space, but you can’t do that in a busy lab,” he said. “So we’ve asked labs to determine if they can pause operations – we are referring to that as hibernation. If so, we want them to do that. Our buildings are minimally staffed with a fraction of active research labs operating.”
 Because students are not on campus, many of the university’s crop and livestock units have fewer employees to help with important work. When crews go out to fields to plant crops or conduct other work, they often have to travel in separate cars, “because it’s really hard to get a six foot social distance when you’ve got a load of people that you have to haul to the field,” Draper said.
 “In the College of Agriculture, we work with living systems,” he said. “We work with seasonal and cyclic processes. We’re concerned about living collections, stored samples, irreplaceable germplasm and animal welfare. We’re not neglecting those responsibilities; we’re progressing with planting spring crops and animal research that is tied to a specific date, but we’re also not prolonging studies beyond completion dates. We’re trying to minimize the amount of time that people are required to interact with one another.

Almost daily Lynn Cheney encounters a person that’s desperate for toilet paper, pasta or flour. Speaking as if the items are as rare as a pearl in an oyster, the customer is in awe of Cheney’s selection at Maker to Main.


  “I have people calling me, ‘I can’t find flour. I can’t find toilet paper. I can’t find basic essentials,'” Cheney said. “For some rhyme or reason other individuals have been hoarding it. I haven’t had that problem.”


  Instead, Cheney has seen new customers, some of whom are old friends, trek to the grocery store on Main Street in Worcester to stock up on hard-to-find items while avoiding the large crowds present at stores with larger footprints.


  “People that I grew up with, that I haven’t seen in 20 years, literally coming out of the woodwork and saying, I’m afraid to go to a grocery store,” Cheney said.


  Maker to Main, a local grocery store, offers local food and supplies in downtown Worcester. It officially opened at the end of February. It provides customers with a unique experience where customers can purchase items on their grocery list online before picking up the order at the store.


  Cheney always envisioned grocery pickup as a possibility for her business only she expected to roll it out in May or June.


  Some of her business plans, though, have compounded problems amid the pandemic.


  Cheney hoped to emphasize reusable bags, which are now temporarily banned by the governor. Her small space on Main Street doesn’t compare to the big box markets and social distancing can be difficult. She also didn’t expect to rely solely on accepting credit cards, which carry fees.


  “All these things that my small store was based upon, based on less waste and reusable bags, it’s been a very stressful, yet humbling experience,” Cheney said. “I’m grateful and exhausted all in the same breath.”


  Throughout the pandemic, Cheney has emphasized the health of her employees. Cheney furloughed one employee with young children, who stay with their grandparents during the day.


  “I did not want to put her or her children or her parents in harm’s way,” Cheney said. “That wasn’t really up for negotiation. I felt this is going to get a lot worse before it gets better.”


  At one point, with employees working from home or staying home because of illnesses not related to the coronavirus, Cheney opened and closed the store every day.


  Recently, staff has returned, allowing Cheney a chance to recuperate.


  The small business owner won’t complain though. Maker to Main not only serves individuals but wholesales to local restaurants. She’s seen directly the financial impact the virus has had on the community.


  “People I’ve had relationships with as brewers and restaurateurs and servers, everyone in the whole restaurant, they come into my store with the most heartbreaking look on their face,” Cheney said. “That has been absolutely devastating to watch.”


  While restaurants have slowed, her supplies have continued to produce. Local farmers continue to deliver fresh vegetables, meats, eggs and dairy to Maker to Main. Some days Cheney customers buy more than 60 dozen eggs a day.


  As much as she sells, the shelves of the local grocer are filled the next day.


  “The upswing of people buying directly from local farmers has been very significant,” Cheney said. “I really, genuinely hope that that remains the case going forward. I hope people don’t forget that local farmers were they ones that bailed them out.”

Rochester police have seen a consistent increase in domestic incidents in March over the last three years. In 2018, there were 43, compared to 57 in 2019. This year, police have seen 71 incidents.
 “We are trying to do what we can to make the community understand what we are doing and how we are doing it so that they can rely on us for help,” Rochester Police Capt. Casey Moilanen said, noting the recent publication of multiple videos. “They can call us when they need something, but there may be cases where they are stuck and feel like they don't have an opportunity to reach out for help.”
 Amy Shillabeer, director of Olmsted County Child & Family Services, said that while they have seen reports about an increase of lethality or involvement of weapons, she wasn’t able to attribute it to COVID-19 and the Stay at Home order.
 Total incident volume for the sheriff’s office is down slightly, with 2,828 incidents in March 2020 and 2,896 in March 2019. But deputies are still out doing their jobs, Behrns said.
 “They are dealing with dangerous offenders, but they might not be doing as much when it comes to traffic enforcement, proactive stuff, because of COVID-19,” he said. “We want them to be safe. We have to be very mindful of our human resources, which are limited, for the sheriff's office.”
 For the Rochester Police Department, total incidents for March 2020 were down by nearly 600 incidents from 2019. In March 2020, there were 4,599 incidents compared to 5,192 in 2019. Moilanen attributed some of that to the closure of bars and restaurants, which would limit some of the calls for disorderly conduct or intoxicated individuals. He also said that because fewer people are out driving, there aren’t as many traffic incidents.
 “People are at home for the most part, so the opportunity to commit some of those crimes is not there or not there to the levels they are when people are out and about,” Moilanen said.
 Minnesota 911 dispatch centers received 11% fewer calls in the fourth week of March, according to information published in the daily State of Emergency Operations Center update on April 7. Statewide traffic volumes are down as well, but traffic fatalities increased from 22 in March 2019 to 28 this March, according to the SEOC update.
