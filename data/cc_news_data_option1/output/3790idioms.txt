Because Sixteen Thirty Fund acts as the fiscal sponsor to so many operations with varying levels of politicking, its political operations dilute the portion of the organization’s overall activities that are considered political. A generally accepted rule of thumb is that 501(c)(4) nonprofits are not allowed to devote more than half of their activities to political purposes but the lack of bright-line rules established by the IRS has created substantial holes in disclosure. This tactic enables initiatives operating under the Sixteen Thirty umbrella to engage in a level of political activity that might not be possible if they operated as separate tax-exempt nonprofits.

 “That has profound implications for the iconic species of the ice, from walrus to polar bears, and for the people who call the Arctic home. ”
 And he warned that “what happens in the Arctic doesn’t stay in the Arctic”.
 “The UK is the Arctic’s closest neighbour and these extreme events affect us all, from changes in weather to increasing sea levels,” he added.

All the affected accounts were suspended due to a _ "copyright infringement,"_ Greenpeace revealed while criticizing Facebook for not providing a more _" satisfactory explanation."_
 The social media giant, which kept the environmentalist pages blocked for about two days last weekend, promptly apologized and blamed the incident on a technical glitch. " _Our systems mistakenly removed these accounts and content. They have since been restored and we 've lifted any limits imposed on identified profiles,"_ a company spokesperson said in a statement.
 However, the company still faced accusations of supporting _" fascist"_ and _" colonialist"_ forces because it turned out that all the blocked accounts were linked to a prolonged protest against a gas pipeline project in Canada's British Columbia.
 The Coastal GasLink (CGL) seeks to build a 670 km (416 mile) pipeline to the coast that is expected to go through the lands of the indigenous people known as Wet'suwet'en (People of the Wa Dzun Kwuh River). The CGL says it obtained consent from elected tribal officials but the deal is disputed by the hereditary chiefs, whose status Canada does not recognize.
 The pipeline project is worth $4.9 billion ($6.6 billion CAD) and has been in the works since 2012, but the hereditary chiefs have repeatedly attempted to stop it with blockades and protests. All of the groups that Facebook recently suspended hosted an online event targeting CGL's majority funder KKR & Co. Inc. last May.

As of September 14, 2020 the combined market capitalization was ZW$217,44 billion (less than US$2,630 billion). After pouring millions of capital into new production lines and ramping up production, all counters on the ZSE have seen their values eroded by more than 50% as a result of exchange rate losses. The same can be said of the pensions and insurance sector where pension and investment values were severely battered. The value of pension and insurance assets has plummeted from a value of US$4,358 billion in December 2013 to about US$2,013 billion in December 2019. There has been an increase in product termination of policies as premiums, contributions and benefits can no longer keep pace with the rate of inflation.

Seven years ago, NBC Sports released a very funny sketch starring Jason Sudeikis as an American football coach named Ted Lasso who manages to get hired as the manager of Tottenham, one of the top soccer clubs in England’s Premier League, which is one of the best leagues in the world. The comedy is the culture clash—a shouting alpha male with a southern accent trying to figure out a totally unfamiliar sport in a strange place, too stubborn to adapt and bringing all the wrong lessons over from America. As soccer becomes more familiar in the U.S., that sketch becomes increasingly quaint, since even your average deep-south gridiron jock knows more and more all the time about the world’s most popular sport. Which makes the premise of _Ted Lasso_ the 2020 TV show questionable; can you really translate a premise that’s thin in the first place, and extend it to a ten-episode season even as soccer becomes less and less exotic to us all the time?

(AP) - A Louisiana state trooper has died following a single- vehicle highway crash that happened just hours after he learned he would be fired for his role last year in the in-custody death of a Black man. Master Trooper Chris Hollingsworth was pronounced dead Tuesday following a brief hospitalization, Warren Lee, chief investigator for the Ouachita Parish Coroner’s Office, told The Associated Press. Hollingsworth had been airlifted to Shreveport early Monday after crashing his personal vehicle on Interstate 20 near Monroe. Police have not released any details about how the crash occurred.Hours before, Hollingsworth had received word that State Police intended to terminate him following an internal investigation into the May 2019 death of Ronald Greene, a case that has drawn mounting scrutiny and become the subject of a federal civil rights investigation.Authorities initially said Greene died after crashing his vehicle into a tree following a high-speed chase in rural northern Louisiana that began over an unspecified traffic violation. But Greene’s family alleges troopers used excessive force and “brutalized” him while taking him into custody. State Police, despite growing pressure, have repeatedly declined to release body-camera footage and other records related to Greene’s arrest, citing the ongoing investigations. Greene’s family called for “the immediate arrest of the remaining men responsible for this tragic and unnecessary death.” “Trooper Hollingsworth’s family has the finality of knowing exactly how he died as their community mourns his loss,” said Lee Merritt, a prominent civil rights attorney representing the family. “The family of Ronald Greene, however, is still being denied the same finality by the State of Louisiana.”Greene’s family has filed a federal wrongful-death lawsuit alleging troopers “brutalized” Greene, used a stun gun on him three times and “left him beaten, bloodied and in cardiac arrest” before covering up his actual cause of death. The controversy deepened last week when Greene’s family released graphic photographs showing deep bruises and cuts to his face, and other photos showing his car with little damage. That raised questions about whether Greene received those injuries in a car crash — as authorities initially told his family — or when troopers arrested him.State Police have said only that the 49-year-old Greene died “after resisting arrest and a struggle with troopers” who took him into custody. The agency opened an internal investigation into the case last month.It was not immediately clear what impact Hollingsworth’s death would have on ongoing investigations. Hollingsworth was the only one of the six troopers involved who had been placed on leave. That came Sept. 9 — the same day the AP filed a records request for body camera footage of Greene’s arrest.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

"articleBody": "
 Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole and his family waited for hours to be tested for COVID-19 last week in Ottawa before being turned away when the centre reached capacity. They eventually got tested in Quebec and are now self- isolating after results came back positive. Predictably, O'Toole blamed the delay on the Trudeau government.
 O'Toole's frustration was understandable, but he was pointing his finger at the wrong government. He and thousands of other people found that centres run by provincial governments, especially those in Ontario and Quebec, were suddenly overwhelmed by people looking to be tested for COVID-19.
 This was a thoroughly predictable situation, given that schools were reopening and children with any COVID-type symptoms had to get an all-clear before being allowed into class. Indeed, many health experts did predict this precise scenario for September. And yet it seemed to arrive as a bolt from the blue, with people lining up for hours just for a test and many turned away.
 The Ford government in Ontario, for one, promises a comprehensive fall plan as early as Tuesday of this week to deal with the spike in demand for testing and the arrival of the annual fall flu season, which threatens to add another layer of complication to an already fraught public health situation. It plans, among other things, to allow pharmacies to conduct some tests.
 The new plan can't come too soon. But Ontarians should be asking why it couldn't have been rolled out _before_ schools reopened, not a week or two after. That would have saved a lot of people a lot of worry and considerable time waiting in long lines. And it would have spared us all from the spectacle of a government that, once again, seems to be just behind the curve when it comes to responding to the pandemic.
 It can't be money. In July, the federal government rolled out its "Safe Restart Agreement" with the provinces. That involved a staggering $19 billion to support provincial governments in the complicated task of reopening society after the lockdown imposed in March to stem the spread of the coronavirus.
 A big chunk of that money -- $4.28 billion -- was earmarked specifically to help cover the cost of testing and contact tracing, which the experts have told us is key to getting on top of this disease. And of that amount, some $1.16 billion was to go to Ontario.
 That's a lot of money to open testing clinics and make sure there would be enough of them, in the right places, for the predictable moment when people would flood in to make sure they and their children were safe to resume something closer to normal life.
 Of course it's complicated, and of course public health officials have been working hard for months on many fronts to contain COVID-19. But it's not too much to expect that relatively simple steps like expanding hours at testing clinics or creating some new pop-up clinics could have been put in place before the surge in demand, not after.
 Ontario is, to be fair, ramping up the number of tests it conducts, topping 40,000 on Saturday on its way to a daily target of 50,000. But it's important to test the right people, not just anyone who turns up at a testing centre, and the message on that front has been mixed.
 Over the summer, Premier Doug Ford insisted that anyone who wants a test should be able to get one. But public health advice is changing. Alberta, for example, no longer recommends that people without symptoms get tested, mostly because that uncovered only a minuscule number of positive cases. With flu season around the corner, it wants to focus resources on those most at risk or most likely to spread COVID-19.
 Ontario should consider adjusting its advice to the public, or at least clarifying it. And it needs to show it is putting all that federal money for testing and tracing to the most effective use. The public has supported difficult health measures for many months now, and this is no time to lose its confidence.

Outside of Robert Parker in the world of wine, there are few critics in any industry that possess more power to make or break tastes than English writer Jim Murray has enjoyed for decades in the world of whiskey. A pioneer in the field of “serious” whiskey/whisky writing, Murray’s annually published _Whisky Bible_ has often been referred to as the industry’s most visible source of accolades—getting a high score or winning a category in Murray’s book can catapult a brand from “widely available” to “hoarded” seemingly overnight. Naturally, wielding that kind of power has led to no shortage of criticism, leveled at Murray’s eccentric personality, techniques, and sometimes unusual picks, but those past criticisms have typically revolved Murray’s choices of which spirits to highlight. Now, however, the writer is under a withering degree of scrutiny not just for his choice of libations, but his choice of words. A controversy has blown up surrounding the sexist language that has for years been ignored within the context of _Whisky Bible_ reviews, and writers, distilleries and retailers are all piling on to condemn some of Murray’s more tasteless quotations from the newest 2021 edition, released last week.

We liberals like to gripe about how Republicans are always appealing to fear. But we can do it too—and we do when the subject is, say, cuts to Medicare.

Wade_ is overturned, but in plenty of others it would almost instantly be made illegal. That's scary. Even in conservative Southern states there are lots of middle-class women who are going to think twice when they're faced squarely with that—and their numbers have been growing for decades.
