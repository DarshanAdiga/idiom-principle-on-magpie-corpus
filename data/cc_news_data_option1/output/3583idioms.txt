Clinical data in the Canadian NDS include data from the Phase 3 randomized, open-label, multicenter ASPEN clinical trial (NCT03053440) that evaluated zanubrutinib versus ibrutinib in patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) or treatment-naïve (TN) WM, which were presented at the 2020 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Virtual Scientific Program and the 25th European Hematology Association (EHA) Congress. In that study, zanubrutinib demonstrated more frequent VGPRs (28.4% vs.19.2% in overall population), although the primary endpoint of statistical superiority related to deep response (VGPR or better) was not met. Zanubrutinib also demonstrated advantages in safety and tolerability compared to ibrutinib. The safety package in the NDS includes pooled safety data from 779 patients with B-cell malignancies treated with BRUKINSA in six clinical trials.

Ryan Hoover rivals former Boylan great Lee Lampley as perhaps the greatest shooter in NIC-10 basketball history.
   
 "Hoover was a bad man," said Johnny Rucker, the point guard on Guilford's 1993 state runner-up team. "They'd run pick-and-roll plays for him and he would shoot from way behind the arc. He was unbelievable."
   
 "Hoover was just so professional, with perfect form," said Tony Fletcher, a star forward on that 1993 Guilford team. "He was not flashy. He just knocked down a lot of shots. He was just automatic. It was demoralizing to go up against that. He was so mechanical it was almost robotic."
   
 Shooting was always Hoover's calling card.
   
 "I saw Hoover at the East Side Boys Club when they used to host AAU tournaments," said former Auburn star Trenod Vines. "He was on a team with Chris Collins, (former Bulls coach) Doug Collins son. Chris Collins would take a step across half court, shoot and it would go in. The next time down, Ryan Hoover would take a step past half court, shoot and it would go in. Then Chris Collins would shoot beyond half court and it would go in. Ryan Hoover would then shoot beyond half court and it would go in. It was the most amazing shooting game I've ever seen."
   
 But the day Ryan Hoover learned not to rely primarily on his shooting was the day our choice as the seventh-greatest basketball player in Rockford area history started to pave his path to an 18-year pro career.
   
 After graduating from Notre Dame, where Hoover made 248 3-pointers and scored 1,269 points, 29th in school history, he was cut after a brief tryout with the NBA's New York Knicks and then kicked around various minor league circuits in the United States. He started in Minot, North Dakota, in the International Basketball Association. "I was a starving artist," Hoover said. "Room and board were paid for, with a little bit of money and gift cards to get food."
   
 He then played for the USBL Florida Sharks and the Gulf Coast Sun Dogs before playing for the Rockford Lightning in the waning days of the CBA in 1999 and 2000. He credits his second Lightning coach, former Detroit Pistons Bad Boy forward Rick Mahorn, with transforming his game.
   
 "He taught me how to run a team and see the whole game," Hoover said. "He had a way of getting through to me and my career advanced through that.
   
 "I tore my ankle up the next summer in the USBL. I thought I was done. I joined Homer Drew's staff (as an assistant coach) at Valparaiso. I was basically retired at age 26. But Athletes in Action called and I went on a tour with them, playing against college teams. Then out of nowhere I got a contract offer from the ABA's Indiana Legends. From there, things took off. I went to Venezuela and was one of the top five players in the league. That proved the international style fit me. I signed a contract with Cantu, Italy, and played the next 13 years in Italy.
   
 Hoover's 18 seasons as a pro are the most of any former Notre Dame player. He didn't retire until 2014, when he turned 40. And he made it as a pro as much with his passing as with his shooting.
   
 "That's what made my career last," the 6-foot-2 Hoover said. "I didn't get it until I played with Mahorn. He said, "I know you can shoot, but I want you to run the team. I don't want you to shoot.' I never heard that before. I always thought I was the best shooter around, so why wouldn't you want me to shoot?
   
 "I knew I could make it in the pros, but I always thought a spot-up shooter was going to be the way to get there, and that wasn't working. I needed to find a new specialty and a new versatility."
   
 His shooting, though, always remained a big part of his game. Hoover won two Italian league championships and led the league in free throw percentage four times. He still holds the single-game record for 3-pointers (12), set in 2004.
   
 And he can still shoot. Even in retirement.
   
 "Ryan Hoover and (No. 8 greatest player) Lee Lampley, you could definitely make the case they are the two best shooters and also the two best guards before (Toronto Raptors point guard) Fred VanVleet," said current Hononegah coach Mike Miller. "All three were potential pros. Ryan was just a stronger, better, more skilled shooter than his peers. When Ryan would come back to town, we'd have him speak at our camps and demonstrate. He'd shoot 100 shots and miss one. Ryan's just at a different level."
   
 That's not an exaggeration. When Hoover showed up at the gym of former Hononegah point guard Danny McLarty, he set a record in McLarty's "3 In, 3 Out" drill. Players get six shots, alternating from behind the 3-point line and one step inside the line. If they make all six, they get to keep shooting until they miss. Hoover made 87 in a row in a video posted on YouTube.
   
 "The strength of Ryan Hoover's game is he was the son of a real good coach," former Boylan coach Steve Goers said. "His dad brought him up and taught him all the fundamentals. He could score from all over."
   
 Hoover -- who was also an all-conference football player, leading the league in receiving in 1990 -- led the NIC-10 in scoring as a senior, averaging 26.1 points in 1992. His dad, Jim Hoover, was a high school basketball coach for 30 years, including a decade as the head coach at Dakota.
   
 "My dad taught me the right way," said Hoover, who also gave credit to Craig Callahan, Mike Miller, Reggie Biffle, Don Tresemer, Frank Cushing, Fran McCaffrey, John MacLeod and Sharm Scheuerman for coaching him at different levels throughout his career . "I was just around basketball a lot. I didn't have a choice. That was my ride home from school. I would stick around the gym. I don't know if I was really into basketball at first. It just started to wear on me. Then as I started to get better, I loved the game.
   
 "Dad would take me to basketball camps throughout the summer that he would coach at around the country. Then I competed against whoever I could, older kids mainly, to see where I stood. If I got my butt kicked, then I went back to the drawing board trying to get better. I competed against my mom with a hoop on our closet. She was a tenacious competitor. That drew me in."
   
 And when he worked on his game, he concentrated on his shot. Until it became seemingly automatic.
   
 "Once you get the right technique down, the key is quality reps," said Hoover, who now lives in a Kansas City suburb and works as the general manager of services for Barrier Compliance Services. "But they have to be quality; you can take bad habits and practice them over and over and not get any better. I can attest to that with my golf swing. But I had the right mechanics and right foundation. Then it's just a matter of where you go with it.
   
 "I became obsessed with becoming the best shooter in the world. The big turning point was when the 3-point line was painted and became a rule in eighth grade. I remember my dad taking me out on the court for the first time after that and saying 'This is going to have a big impact on the game of basketball.' It changed my life.
   
 "When it became a rule, I decided to make the most of this. It gave me a big weapon. The 3-point line basically got me a college scholarship and allowed me to make a living for 18 years."

The second thing to watch is the composition of the Cabinet and LDP leadership billets.
 Seeing who makes it into these postings will reveal much about the behind-the- scenes machinations within the LDP. Traditionally, the prime minister apportions Cabinet appointments based on factional end-strengths.
 In other words, if a faction has 25 percent of the LDP’s sitting Diet members, it receives about 25 percent of the postings. Of course, rivals tend to get a lower percentage and allies tend to get more, so it will be fairly easy to discern who Suga considers friends and enemies inside the LDP based on Cabinet postings alone.
 The Cabinet and LDP leadership appointments are also important because they will influence the prospects of future would-be government leaders. We should observe where prime minister-hopefuls like Taro Kono and Toshimitsu Motegi fall in the pecking order. The most important position to watch is the one Suga currently inhabits: the Chief Cabinet Secretary. This is the prime minister’s de facto number two, and the role includes the herculean responsibilities of both managing the Cabinet and serving as the administration’s spokesperson. Whomever receives that position will be postured well to move up the line-of-succession.

There is more center Brook Lopez can give if asked, and Khris Middleton needs to use his play in Antetokounmpo's absences against the Heat to boost his game to that next proverbial level.
 Budenholzer's twice-tried, twice-thwarted system - based on making three-point shots over the top of his freakishly versatile penetrator, while counting on opponents to miss theirs - needs a makeover. His team's focus on defending the paint coupled with the game-by-game randomness of perimeter shooting earned the Bucks' their No 1 defensive ranking again this season.

After the Democratic and Republican national conventions, the American public is now in the political mean season for the November election. I often wonder if cable and internet news programming is too much information for the average American.
 As much as people are brought together by instant communication, we must digest and evaluate the information we receive with a jaundice eye and careful acceptance. We must remember that writers offer information for the purpose of informing, or persuasion, or shamefully to misdirect public decisions. While these types of communication are protected free speech under our Constitution, discerning the credibility of our information is critical. American politics is inundated with information and misinformation. This is a reality we must confront in our public political forums.
 In the coronavirus era, this nation and the world have suffered irreparable harm to their economic, social and political institutions. Everyday citizens too have felt the sting of this new and cruel virus. The virus has afflicted millions of people around the world, and 180,000 in this country alone have died. Two nephews in my own family contracted the virus; sadly one died, and the other is learning to reuse his body. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is both a political and economic problem, with misinformation about the virus perpetuated for political gains and the brunt of the virus is absorbed by poor and working-class people.
 Rightly the medical workers and other essential workers are America’s heroes during this COVID-19 pandemic. Medical workers in particular have provided around the clock care to the afflicted in an amazing commitment to purpose that is nothing short of heroic. Many have lost their lives in the process of caring for the afflicted. As in combat, these medics brave the danger so inherent in their profession.
 By the same token, this new public health reality is being politicized to an extent that almost obscures the reality of the pandemic itself.
 We are asked by medical doctors to wash our hands often after public contact, and to use a mask while venturing into family or public gatherings. This public health warning doesn’t seem like an earth-shattering request, but to many folks it is a governmental attack upon their constitutional right to personal freedom and liberty. A silly yet albeit political argument. Of course, the countering point is that of the good and welfare of the greater population. Does an afflicted person enjoy the right to carelessly expose others to a potentially deadly disease for which there is no known cure? I should think the answer is no, anymore than shouting “fire” in a crowded theater. We need to use good judgment and common sense in dealing with this pandemic for society.
 Lastly, the economy has suffered beyond repair in some cases. Government must address this injury in earnest. However, public money should not be allocated to healthy businesses or government-elected officials and appointees. Frankly, such handouts seem questionable. George Washington’s admonition to an underling is appropriate here: “[in politics] it’s not enough to be pure of heart, one must also give the appearance of being pure of heart.” So, the challenge for government is to help small business owners regroup and fill gaps in commercial life.
 This pandemic has been cruel and unfair, but let’s prepare a future that can predict such calamities better and where the government can’t be blamed for a critical err in judgment. Vote wisely and stay informed.

By Nick Carey
 Sept 9 (Reuters) - Delivery fleet operators face regulatory pressure in California and other states to buy electric vehicles, but a surge in package deliveries thanks to coronavirus lockdowns has major firms itching to switch to electric right now.
 And they want far more than just battery-powered versions of diesel- or gas- guzzling trucks and vans.
 Fleet operators such as United Parcel Service Inc hunger for computers on wheels that can harvest data and upgrade safety or autonomous features overnight to save money and boost profit.
 "For us, it's not just about making the wheels turn with a zero-emission vehicle," said Scott Phillippi, UPS's senior director of fleet maintenance and engineering, who envisions "Tesla-like" vehicles in the company's vast fleet. "It's about an integrated-technology vehicle - and that's really what we're pushing for."
 With its ability to send wireless upgrades and fixes to customers' electric cars, Tesla Inc is seen as a bellwether for electrification. Major companies like UPS want to harness that power to bring cost-saving, autonomous or safety measures to their fleets in real time.
 If, for instance, a manufacturer developed a feature to prevent a truck from bumping into a loading dock, UPS could have it in tens of thousands of vehicles overnight to prevent expensive dents, Phillippi said.
 UPS, Amazon.com Inc, and other e-commerce delivery companies are both creating and shaping the emerging market for electric vans and trucks. Economics and competitive advantages created by data will drive the market for electric commercial vehicles.
 Demand for electric commercial vehicles is accelerating in part because battery range, long a concern for fleets, has improved dramatically, while battery costs have fallen.
 UPS has ordered 10,000 vans from UK startup Arrival Ltd - the majority for the U.S. market - in which UPS also owns a minority stake. Arrival is working on self-driving technology, which is one reason why UPS is supporting the company, UPS's Phillippi said.
 The company has also reserved 125 of Tesla's long-awaited Semi big rigs, 50 electric trucks from Workhorse Group Inc - with an option for 950 more - and is testing electric trucks with California startup Xos.
 Tesla's Semi was due to go into production in 2019, but is now slated for 2021. Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.
 Amazon ordered 100,000 electric vans last year from startup Rivian Automotive LLC - in which it has invested - and ordered 1,800 more from Daimler AG's Mercedes-Benz car and vans division for its European fleet last month.
 While demand is soaring, supply is still virtually non-existent and production has been beset by delays.
 "Ultimately, there's no trucks available yet," Phillippi said. "We're just waiting for vehicles to show up."
 The pressure is rising for manufacturers to deliver. Startups such as Rivian and Arrival are racing with larger, established vehicle makers including Daimler, Ford Motor Co and General Motors Co to get electric trucks into production.
 Startup Xos Trucks, for example, has begun low-volume production of vans with Mexican auto supplier Metalsa, a part-owner and strategic partner, using a "modular" battery approach where battery packs are added based on a customer's range needs.
 Xos Trucks Chief Executive Dakota Semler recounts the recent reaction of a customer when told their vehicles would be delivered in 2021.
 "They said, 'What do I have to do get it by the end of this year?'" Semler said.
 'ACTIVELY RAISING CAPITAL'
 The years-long journey of one electric delivery vehicle startup, California- based Chanje Energy Inc, shows the challenges vehicle makers and their customers face creating a new industry on the fly.
 California's decision in June to require commercial truck manufacturers to sell a rising number of zero-emission vehicles, starting in 2024, drew attention to the market.
 But Bryan Hansel, Chanje's CEO, said California's mandate made little difference. The surge in e-commerce delivery caused by the coronavirus pandemic had already caused fleet operators to zero in on the 50 miles per gallon (80 km per gallon) equivalent his vans offer versus the 6 to 8 mpg averaged by conventional diesel trucks.
 Back in 2018, package delivery company FedEx Corp ordered 1,000 Chanje vans. But Chanje had to pause while its battery supplier, China's Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL) , updated its batteries' energy density.
 That boosted the range of Chanje's vehicles to 150 miles from 100 miles. Its 2021 model should have a range of 200 miles, Hansel said, making it capable of handling 90% of U.S. last-mile delivery routes - the "last-mile" of e-commerce where drivers drop off packages at individual consumers' doors is typically the most expensive.
 Chanje had to tackle other problems.
 Like other fleet operators, FedEx is not a fueling company - conventional fleets send vehicles to gas stations to fill up - so it lacked chargers for a large fleet. So Chanje became an energy services company, building out overhead charging stations at 20 FedEx depots across California to charge all 1,000 vans it will deliver in the first half of 2021.
 Chanje also has stepped up its software and electronics capability. After drivers reported the vehicles would roll backward if they took their foot off the accelerator on a hill, Chanje spent four weeks rewriting the code with a software fix. Then, according to Hansel, the company "just flashed it over the wire to every truck we've ever built."
 Chanje's vans are assembled in China by FDG Electric Vehicles Ltd, currently its main investor.
 "But we are actively in the market raising capital because the capital markets seem to be very interested in the EV space right now," Hansel said.
