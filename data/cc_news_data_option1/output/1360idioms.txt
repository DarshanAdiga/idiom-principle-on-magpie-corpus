In addition to his lungs, the patient’s immune system and liver function, both on the ropes at the height of his illness, were steadily returning to normal four days after he got the plasma antibody infusion.
 For a 49-year-old woman with no underlying illnesses, COVID-19 infection quickly progressed to shortness of breath and hospital admission. By day seven after the onset of her symptoms, her chest X-ray had shown the hallmark opacity of ground glass and she had build-ups of fluids or proteins — infiltrates — scattered throughout both lungs. On day 10 following the onset of symptoms, she got an infusion of convalescent plasma. By day 12, she had cleared the virus from her system and her chest X-ray was clearing markedly.
 A 50-year-old male with “massive infiltrates” in both lungs showed a gradual clearing of his lungs and tested negative for infection 25 days after his first symptoms appeared.
 In all 10 patients, the symptoms that had driven them to seek emergency care had either disappeared or largely improved within one to three days of their receiving a transfusion of antibodies from a recovered donor. Two of the three patients who had been breathing with the help of a mechanical ventilator were able to step down to oxygen delivered into the nose.
 None of the 10 patients died, and only one unexpected side effect — a red bruise on one patient’s face — was detected.
 The study was not designed to have a comparison group of patients that got no convalescent plasma. But the authors did create a control group from a random selection of 10 COVID-19 patients treated in the same hospitals and matched to the 10 study participants in age and gender and the illness severity.

“That’s tremendously good news.”
 Though testing levels are inconsistent, the number of new cases confirmed daily in King County has been generally declining since March 26. An apparent spike of 269 new infections reported April 5 included delayed results from previous days' testing, health officials said.
 “I think it’s too early to be confident, but I do feel we are moving in the right direction,” said Dr. Jeff Duchin, health officer for Public Health — Seattle & King County. “The progress is very tenuous because as soon as we start getting together again and having more contact, the number of serious infections and deaths will start to rise.”
 The UW modeling has been in the national spotlight since President Donald Trump’s team cited it as one of the reasons for extending social distancing recommendations through April. Dr. Deborah Birx, White House coronavirus response coordinator, said the group’s projections were one of the sources used in the administration’s estimate that 100,000 to 240,000 Americans could die of the new virus.
 Some critics have said the UW estimate is too rosy because it assumes uniform social distancing across the country, even though some cities and states still have not imposed restrictions. Murray said he thinks it’s likely those outliers will fall in line within the next few days.
 The UW model relies on reported coronavirus deaths as its ground truth, and pulls in data from around the world on things like hospitalization rates, viral transmissibility and the impact of social distancing.
 When the project started, the only evidence about peak hospitalization and lockdowns came from Wuhan, China, where the epidemic started. Since then, Italy and Spain have both imposed widespread restrictions, and have seen the number of cases peak, then begin to decline, Murray said. Now those experiences have been factored into to the U.S. projections.
 The results' lower estimate of hospital bed shortages is largely due to better data from New York and other states. Initial information from China suggested the number of people hospitalized was 11 times higher than the number who died, but in U.S. cities so far, the range is between five to seven times higher, Murray said.
 The new data, along with improvements in forecast methodology, have also lowered some uncertainty levels. The March 26 projection of 1,400 deaths in Washington state fell within a range of statistical possibilities from 316 to 2,535. The new estimate of 632 deaths has a much narrower uncertainty range of 557 to 741.
 The UW modeling effort began as a way to help UW Medicine plan for the epidemic and was expanded after other hospitals and states began clamoring for similar insights. Even though the estimates for Washington have steadily decreased, they were extremely helpful for planning, Brandenburg said.
 Hospitals need to be ready for the worst-case scenario, she explained. While she’s delighted the new estimates veer more toward best-case territory, she still worries. “In the back of my mind, I’m still thinking we need to be prepared for those (higher estimates) because we don’t know for sure.”
 Murray and his team will continue updating their model results daily, even as they begin to look ahead to what is likely to happen next. Society can’t remain locked down indefinitely.
 But the very thing that has helped control the initial wave of the epidemic — a steep drop in transmission rates — also means that only a small fraction of people have been infected so far, Murray pointed out. That leaves a vast pool of susceptible human hosts for the virus.
 In order to prevent another major wave, social-distancing measures will probably need to be eased gradually, accompanied by expanded testing and isolation of infected people.
 “We cannot count on herd immunity, which simply means lots and lots of people got sick,” Murray said. “We’ll need other strategies."

At any rate, the kids and I joined him on the hill to work Saturday. There were dead trees to drag, root balls and small limbs that needed put into the fire, sections of tree trunk to cut into woodstove-sized pieces and straw and grass seed to be spread.
 We worked for hours. Multiflora rosebushes were cut out and burned. The burn pile grew higher and higher. We planned to cook out over the coals around suppertime.
 At one point, I noticed a grape vine that had been cut loose from the ground. Wild grapes can strangle trees, growing along their trunks and up into their canopies, breaking branches, shutting out light to the tree’s leaves, and even making ice and snow damage more likely.
 Feeling adventurous, I went over to the vine and tested to see if it would hold my weight. It slipped a little, but caught and held. I took a small swing. And then a slightly larger one. After the third swing, my ability to hold on was more in question than whether the vine would hold me.
 My daughter and son came to watch. And then, they each plucked up the courage to try it themselves.
 My son took a tentative swing on each of his tries, but my daughter really let it rip, running backwards and flying forwards on the vine. When she got to the peak of her swing and she could see how far out over the edge of the bank she was, she started squealing and laughing.
 I took photos of each of them grinning from ear to ear while swinging.
 The adventurous spirit took hold of them, and they then took turns riding the trees that were being pulled behind the little tractor.

A circuit judge has denied a request for an emergency hearing by a Columbia businessman jailed for civil contempt amid the coronavirus pandemic.
   
 Boone County in February offered Seth Reynolds a settlement where he could be released by paying a monthly fine of $100, and he is choosing to stay in jail.
   
 Reynolds is in defiance of an order by Circuit Judge Jodie Asel that he remove a fence and shed which are allegedly too close to Creasy Springs Road. The case has dragged on for years now. Reynolds was previously sentenced to spend overnights in jail until the structures came down, but on March 24 asked for temporary house arrest due to the pandemic.
   
 Asel, in accordance with the wishes of Boone County, on March 27 jailed him around the clock for the duration of a stay-at-home order.
   
 Her decision comes at a time when jails around the country and in Boone County are releasing low-level detainees and offenders due to concerns of outbreaks in the close confines of correctional facilities.
   
 On Friday, Reynolds' attorney Steve Wyse asked for an emergency hearing in the matter on Monday, which Asel denied. In her case notes, the judge writes Monday hearings are limited to in-custody criminal cases by video.
   
 The settlement offer from Boone County, which Reynolds declined, reads that he could be freed if he pays a fine of $100 per month and signs a hold harmless agreement.
   
 District 1 Commissioner Fred Parry said Reynolds could free himself for a reasonable cost, and described his continued holdout as a publicity stunt.
   
 "I can't begin to imagine why Mr. Reynolds would subject himself to imprisonment when he clearly has a very easy option to comply with the court order, at minimal expense or inconvenience," Parry wrote in an email.
   
 "The County's original position has been upheld on every level of judicial review. It's time for Mr. Reynolds to comply with the order, go home and remove himself from the limelight," Parry added.
   
 Wyse said the offer, which expired March 13, was made prior to, and is unrelated to, Reynolds being jailed during the pandemic.
   
 Reynolds did not accept the agreement on a matter of principle, Wyse said. He was also not willing to accept the hold-harmless agreement preventing future litigation.
   
 Since losing the case at the appellate court, Reynolds has spent more than 320 nights in the county jail. He has spent the past 10 full days in the county jail in defiance of Asel's order.
   
 On Wednesday, Reynolds offered to pay a $1,000 fine to settle the matter. Wyse said he has not heard back yet.

Addison Gilbert Vice President Cynthia Donaldson said all confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases who require hospitalization are being taken to Beverly Hospital.
 “We are continually reviewing this and all of our protocols and will update them as needed to keep our patients, staff and community healthy,” she said.
 Addison Gilbert has four licensed ICU beds, but Donaldson explained that there is capacity for more if needed.
 Robertson said his giving of such a sizable donation was his way “just to help out.”
 “We are doing whatever we can,” he added.
 After purchasing the personal protective equipment on his way back from Florida, Robertson reached out to state Senate Minority Leader Bruce Tarr, a Gloucester resident, about how he could donate the equipment properly to Addison Gilbert.
 “What they did was more than just commendable and I know Senator Tarr was really happy to act as a facilitator,” said Don Siriani, a representative from Tarr’s office.
 Robertson and his two sons, Bradley and Dan, stopped by Addison Gilbert Hospital early afternoon Monday to drop off the equipment — all of which will be used to protect those who are caring for those suffering from COVID-19.
 “It is one thing to think of (All Season Septic) as a local business, but it is also important and not lost on Sen. Tarr’s end that that local business is really made up of a local family who really recognizes the value of community and really tying to do a service by protecting people,” Siriani said.
 For those who work at the hospital, donations such as Robertson’s ensures safety around the clock.
 “It is critically important that we protect our staff on the front lines,” Donaldson said. “We are tremendously grateful for the outpouring of support from the many generous individuals and groups who have donated resources and supplies to help protect our health care workers.”
 Medical health care providers are closely monitoring and adapting to the rapidly evolving situation with COVID-19, Donaldson explained.

The other thing I do when I talk with reporters is to be straight. I try not to deceive them or to be defensive, because those are precisely the ways most people get themselves into trouble with the press. Instead, when a reporter asks me a tough question, I try to frame a positive answer, even if that means shifting the ground. For example, if someone asks me what negative effects the world’s tallest building might have on the West Side, I turn the tables and talk about how New Yorkers deserve the world’s tallest building, and what a boost it will give the city to have it again. When a reporter asks why I build only for the rich, I note that the rich aren’t the only ones who benefit from my buildings. I explain that I put thousands of people to work who might otherwise be collecting unemployment, and that I add to the city’s tax base every time I build a new project. I also point out that buildings like Trump Tower have helped spark New York’s renaissance.

The CCC talked about the possibility of allowing licensed recreational cultivation facilities – which are allowed to continue tending to their crops during the shutdown but cannot start new plants – to sell their product to medical treatment centers. Commissioner Kay Doyle was tasked with taking the lead on determining the feasibility of that and other ideas.
 Of course, not all recreational consumers are switching to the medical side of the legal industry. Many are likely returning to the illicit sources of marijuana they relied on prior to Massachusetts launching legal sales.
 "It's always been impossible to really quantify what's going on in the illicit market and what impact legalization is having. But of course I'm concerned that people that will not be able to go to an adult-use store for the period of time that they remain closed will use the illicit market," Hoffman said. "That's something I'm very concerned about."
 The chairman said the CCC has been busy processing license applications during the adult-use industry shutdown in hopes of keeping the steady pace of approvals and store openings going whenever retailers are allowed to re-open.
 "I'm sure it'll take some time to get it up to speed. What I'm pleased about ... we are working pretty efficiently at the commission in terms of processing applications and so I think once the industry is allowed to reopen, we can, I think, have not just the current licensees, but a large number of licenses that have been processed during this period of time closer to being ready to open," he said. "It's not going to be an on-off light switch and get everything back to normal. I think it'll take a little adjustment, but as I said, I think we'll have a pretty strong queue of people ready to go in addition to the ones that have already been licensed."
 During Friday's meeting, which was held via video conference with access for the press and public, the CCC also began a discussion of other ways it might be able to ease some of the economic impacts of the pandemic on its licensees.
 The possibilities Collins mentioned included extending business license renewal dates until the state of emergency is lifted, being flexible about industry worker registrations given that some workers may be laid off and eventually brought back, and waiving certain fees like the $40 a month cost of tying into the CCC's tracking software.
 "I am concerned for everybody feeling these impacts. The adult-use industry is, however, unique because of the conflict between federal and Massachusetts law. Much of the relief being offered to companies and employees through the $2 trillion CARES Act will not be available to this industry," Hoffman said. "We have an obligation, I strongly believe, to do everything that we possibly can to mitigate the economic damage that's being incurred by these companies and individuals within the bounds of our regulatory authority."

Bloomberg) -- In the past seven days, a higher volume of deals has fallen apart than been announced. The stark statistic, aggravated by Xerox Holdings Corp. ending its hostile $35 billion bid for HP Inc., sums up dealmaking in the age of the coronavirus: companies dogged by uncertainty and faced with a sudden cash crunch have started reining in ambitious expansion plans.
 Those that successfully ride out the crisis are likely to find a very different landscape waiting than the one they expected going into 2020. A decade-long boom in mergers and acquisitions, marked by some of the largest transactions in history, ground to a halt in March as the pandemic sent stock markets reeling and slammed debt markets shut.
 Instead of lingering over the drop in M&A activity -- down more than a third this year to the lowest level since 2014 -- dealmakers are trying to focus on the most resilient sectors and opportunities that might be waiting on the other side of the pandemic. Bloomberg surveyed bankers to ask which industries might be the first to see renewed activity, which strategic deals still make sense, and whether private equity firms will use their vast stockpiles of dry powder to snap up cheaper targets.
 The opportunities may not emerge for some time, and could be few and far between when they do. The S&P 500 fell 18% this year through Monday, and a plunge in U.S. hiring is already hinting at the longer-term extent of the pandemic's toll on world economies. And agreed deals are falling apart on a daily basis, with U.S. aerospace suppliers Woodward Inc. and Hexcel Corp. announcing Monday they scrapped a plan to combine.
 Still, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s David Ludwig is getting ready, saying that event-driven bear markets tend to snap back quickly.
 "Once investors are more confident that negative tail outcomes are unlikely, we expect significant public activity across all sectors and product classes," said Ludwig, head of Americas equity capital markets at the bank. "And we expect that to occur in a reasonable period of time."
 Health-Care Deals
 The race for treatments and a vaccine for Covid-19 has turned a spotlight on the health-care industry. Pharmaceutical giants are already teaming up with tiny biotechnology firms to develop experimental therapies for the virus, and Johnson & Johnson saw its shares surge after partnering with the U.S. government to work on an inoculation. While many companies are focused for the moment on maintaining drug supplies to stretched health-care systems, the crisis could throw up a wave of potential dealmaking, advisers said.
 "Health care is a sector that might have interesting opportunities as a result of this crisis and is one of the sectors that has had the least impact," said Nestor Paz-Galindo, UBS Group AG's head of M&A for Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
 One of the biggest deals of the year, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.'s $10 billion acquisition of Qiagen NV, was announced just days before the outbreak was deemed a pandemic. The target makes testing kits for the virus as well as the components others need for theirs. It's had to ration the kits among clients while it works to ramp up production as much as 80% in two months.
 The industry is also proving a bright spot in a largely moribund market for initial public offerings. Zentalis Pharmaceuticals Inc., a clinical-stage cancer treatment developer, increased the size of its share sale and rose 29% in its New York trading debut Friday.
 "Sectors like technology and health care will be at the front end of the recovery," said Patrick Ramsey, global head of M&A at Bank of America Corp.
 Microsoft Corp. sealed one of the biggest deals announced in the second half of March, agreeing to acquire 5G software maker Affirmed Networks Inc. for $1.35 billion, illustrating ongoing appetite for growing technologies.
 All-Stock Transactions
 As equity prices plummet, stock deals -- which allow a target company's investors to share in the benefits if the market recovers later, and don't require funding -- are likely to become more compelling.
 The biggest deal of 2020 so far, Aon Plc's $30 billion acquisition of Willis Towers Watson Plc, looks tailor-made for the crisis. The all-stock transaction, which will create the world's biggest insurance brokerage, was pitched to investors as a way for the companies to better deal with increasing global volatility.
 "When the market does come back we expect to see a lot of stock deals," Ramsey said. "We continue to see a lot of dialogue around joint venture activity as well."
 Stable Sectors
 When the economy stabilizes after the crisis, the first wave of deals could involve companies looking to fix supply chain problems or get their operations back on track.
 "Transactions driven by strategic need will come first," said Citigroup Inc.'s head of EMEA M&A, Alison Harding-Jones, who also is the vice chairman of banking, capital markets and advisory. "We expect intra-industry consolidation as well as vertical integration to secure and support supply chains."
 Such deals could take the form of an automaker or industrial company, for example, buying a supplier to diversify its supply chain or reduce dependence on foreign components.
 Infrastructure assets -- characterized by stable cash flow from long-term contracts -- could be particularly appealing both to buyers and to lenders, which have shown willingness to finance such deals despite shying away from most leveraged buyouts.
 KKR & Co. beat out rivals last month to seal a $5 billion deal for the waste- management arm of U.K. utility owner Pennon Group Plc by showing up with a formal, fully financed offer. The value of announced infrastructure deals in the first quarter was $79 billion, according to data provider Preqin, up from the $69 billion agreed in the first quarter of 2019.
 Defense Strategies
 For now, advisers are doing more conference calls than usual with nervous clients across various industries than working on actual deals. While these meetings are usually focused on information-gathering or liquidity needs, bankers are zeroing in on the companies that could use their advisory services most once the crisis is over.
 Defending against opportunistic bidders and keeping activist investors off their backs seems to be top of a lot of executives' minds, especially as lower valuations make buying into a stock more affordable. While some activists have given their targets additional time, others have pressed ahead with campaigns as share prices plummet.
 "People are increasingly thinking about activist preparedness and raid defense in light of the market dislocation and low stock prices," Ramsey said. Some have even proactively adopted so-called poison pills to guard against unwanted takeovers, adding the defense mechanisms at a pace not seen since the financial crisis.
 Raising Debt
 Some large debt deals have also raised hopes that deep-pocketed buyers could go shopping for targets that now have lower valuations. Oracle Corp. sold $20 billion of bonds last week, earmarking it for purposes that could include stock buybacks or "future acquisitions."
 Airbnb Inc. said Monday it's raising $1 billion in debt and equity securities. While the money could help the home-rental company weather the economic crisis without going public, it could also allow the company to snap up businesses struggling to survive the crisis, Bloomberg News has reported.
 Private Equity
 While private equity firms have their hands full for now managing struggling portfolio companies, they're still sitting on a $2 trillion war chest that could be put to work as valuations stabilize. Some of the hardest-hit industries -- from energy to tourism and restaurants -- might provide the biggest bargains.
 During the last financial crisis, buyouts dived from an all-time high of $246 billion globally in the second quarter of 2007 to $24.5 billion in the third quarter of 2008, during which Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. filed for bankruptcy, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Dealmaking took two full years to surpass 2008's top quarter and hasn't yet reached $100 billion in a single quarter again, the data show.
 Waiting Mode
 Many potential buyers may choose to wait out the crisis before making any big moves, instead holding onto much-needed cash and focusing on running their own businesses. Apollo Global Management Inc. recently ended its pursuit of broadcaster Tegna Inc. Asbury Automotive Group Inc. last month pulled out of a $1 billion purchase of Park Place Dealerships, saying it would instead draw down its debt facilities.
 The crisis "will certainly have a lasting impact given the drastic effect on the global economy," said Bruno Villard, BNP Paribas SA's head of M&A for EMEA. "It will not be just a blip in deals flow."
