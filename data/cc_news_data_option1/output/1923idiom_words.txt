Now, the clash with the United States over the pandemic is fanning broader tensions on trade, espionage and other fronts — disputes that could intensify as President Donald Trump makes his contest with Beijing a theme of his reelection campaign.
 “We could cut off the whole relationship,” Trump said in an interview on Fox Business on Thursday.
 While the hostility has so far been mostly confined to words, there are warning signs the relationship could worsen. The trade truce that Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, reached in January could fall apart, despite recent pledges to keep to its terms. Other tensions, including those over of Taiwan and the South China Sea, are also flaring.
 “After the pandemic, the international political landscape will totally change,” Wu Shicun, president of the National Institute for South China Sea Studies, said in a telephone interview from Haikou, in southern China. “The confrontation between China and the United States — in terms of trade, technology, the Taiwan issue, the South China Sea issue — will be a bigger problem.”
 In its first months, the coronavirus outbreak delivered a political blow to Xi, after officials held back information about initial infections and discouraged doctors from reporting cases. Trump, by contrast, appeared confident that the United States had little to fear, and he praised Xi’s handling of the crisis.
