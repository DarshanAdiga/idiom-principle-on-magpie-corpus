In these current circumstances, have you been able to analyze the pros and cons of being away from your family and on tour all the time?I have mixed feelings. On one hand, touring is difficult, but the other, it means that things are going well. It's hard for the family and for children... That moment when you have to stop being with them. They know I'm working. It's not that I don't get sad, but I call them all the time to keep tabs on them.

“ _En unas semanas de confinamiento hemos avanzado lo que hubiéramos avanzado en un lustro en condiciones de normalidad…_ ” y esto, sin duda, ha supuesto de hecho que la vida se traspase del espacio físico al mundo digital. Hoy las redes de telecomunicaciones no sólo transmiten datos -entendidos como bits y bytes- sino que transmiten sentimientos, emociones, motivos, opiniones, palabras de aliento, sorpresas, información valiosa, consejos de salud, rutinas de ejercicio, reuniones de trabajo y contenidos educativos, entre otros. Lo anterior ha permitido a una gran parte de la población, continuar con su vida cotidiana: padres que trabajan a distancia utilizando herramientas de videoconferencia o de comercio electrónico, familias que se mantienen unidas en el confinamiento a través de redes sociales, llamadas de voz, videoconferencias y servicios de mensajería, así como niños y jóvenes que han podido continuar sus estudios a través de plataformas educativas disponibles.

From the moment you wrote your first song, were you clear about what you wanted to do with your music career?I've written songs and poems ever since I was a child. It's hard to have clarity when you're so young. But what I can say is that things come when you least expect them. Initially, I took up music as a hobby — I had a job, children and a family. I had to work and make ends meet at the same time. You can't live on the dream alone. But when I left work, I'd go straight to my studio to work on my music.
