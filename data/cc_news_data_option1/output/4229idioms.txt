I also recommend using a Ten Year Rule, planning for 10 years into the future, so in 2020, you should be focusing on your spending needs through 2030. That money should then be invested in fixed-income securities that mature the year you need the money. This largely protects the money you plan to withdraw from the fluctuations of the market. If the market is down, you can wait until your assets recover before having to sell to fill up your fixed-income portfolio. Furthermore, with a 10-year lead time, you have the time to adjust your spending.
 Everyone‚Äôs situation is different. Some years you‚Äôll see higher inflation or increased medical costs that could increase your withdrawals, while other years, you may see stellar growth and be able to withdraw less principal. Perhaps you‚Äôve caught on already, but your overarching financial plan‚Äîincluding how much you‚Äôre withdrawing‚Äîshould be revisited at minimum every two years. Whenever there are life changes, including birth, death, divorce, marriage, or a change in employment or long-term health, your plan should be revisited and adjusted if needed.
 One of my finance professors often joked with me saying, ‚ÄúThe last check you write before you die should bounce!‚Äù However, most investors and advisers generally prefer to err on the side of withdrawing too little money, having some left to your heirs.

Most striking in all, though, is how bizarre it is that we haven‚Äôt read a thousand stories like this during the pandemic. We‚Äôre almost finished with our seventh full month of quarantine, a hellscape of endless Zoom happy hours (no one likes them and I‚Äôm glad we all seemed to agree, at the same time ‚Äî month three? ‚Äî to just cut it out) and Zoom work calls (a lot of me not wearing pants and trying to figure out new ways to explain why I can‚Äôt go into another room to get a notebook I forgot because, again, I am usually not wearing pants).
 Haven‚Äôt we all done something on a work call that, in normal circumstances, we‚Äôd never do during a meeting? Let he without sin cast the first stone; the benefit of working from home is in the comfort to do whatever you want. Endless snacks without judgment, cigarette breaks at your leisure, _Real Housewives_ on all goddamn day.
 Some of you, I‚Äôm sure, have turned your video off for a brief moment during a video conference to take a big, hearty pull off a joint, and turned it back on when the smoke finally dissipated and your eyes look, miraculously, droopy. I, of course, have never done this, as I am a good employee and have never done any drugs at all (my review is next week, please be cool), but it would be naive to think that most people aren‚Äôt engaged in some fuckery during a work Zoom. That‚Äôs the benefit of all this time working from home ‚Äî the aberration in our routine allows for deviations in our day, which can include pleasure. You‚Äôre going to tell me you‚Äôve _never_ taken a quick three minutes midday to crank your hog? To mash your meat? To butter your own muffin? There‚Äôs so little joy left in our lives; are we not at least owed the time to toot our own horns?
 I mean, maybe not during an active Zoom call where your video is still on. Time and place, I suppose.

 Soon she became an Oregon state representative and has most recently been a state senator representing portions of Multnomah County and vicinity. In this position she is working to increase funding for public schools, especially because she credits Oregon‚Äôs public schools with giving her a chance at success. In addition, she helped pass Oregon‚Äôs paid family and medical leave, and strongly supports measures to ensure equal pay for equal work.

The ICRC's repeated calls for an affirmation that IHL regulates all means and methods of warfare and for discussions on how IHL applies to cyber operations during armed conflict come in response to the changing reality. Today, cyber operations are used during armed conflicts. An increasing number of States are developing military cyber capabilities, and their use is likely to increase in the future. Considering how rapidly our societies are digitizing, it is critical that IHL be interpreted and applied in a way that protects the digital means and tools that we increasingly rely on in every aspect of our lives, just as it protects physical objects. The ICRC shared its views on these issues in a detailed position paper to the two processes mandated by the First Committee.

Back in March, it felt like Ronald Thompkins was an afterthought in the running back battle.
 After suffering multiple major knee injuries and a setback in 2019, it was hard to imagine Thompkins being a part of things this Fall.
 However, not only is Thompkins in the mix, he'll go out to Ohio State as NU's No. 2 running back behind Dedrick Mills.
 Position coach Ryan Held called Thompkins a five-tool player that can do it all, and they like what he's shown in practice the last month.
 The extra time off also appears to have really benefited Thompkins, who has battled injury the last three years.
 If things work out with Thompkins long-term, the Husker coaching staff is going to look pretty smart taking a flier on a guy many SEC powers shied away from because of his injury issues.
