ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) — Derek Dietrich led off the Texas seventh inning with a tiebreaking home run and the Rangers beat the Los Angeles Dodgers 6-2 in a later-than-usual Jackie Robinson Day game on Friday night.
 It was the first time in six years the Dodgers were away from home for Major League Baseball’s annual observation of Robinson breaking sports color barrier. It is traditionally held April 15, the date in 1947 that he made his debut with the Brooklyn Dodgers, but had to be altered because the coronavirus pandemic pushed back the start of this season nearly four months.
 After Los Angeles tied the game with two runs in the top of the seventh, Dietrich's opposite-field shot to left off reliever Jake McGee (2-1) put Texas up 3-2. Shin-Soo Choo and Nick Solak added RBI hits, and Jose Trevino a sacrifice fly, in the four-run outburst as the Rangers won for only the second time in 12 games.
 The Dodgers (24-10), coming off a doubleheader sweep at San Francisco and without a series loss this season, were the only MLB team without at least 10 wins before Friday.
 Mike Minor, the Texas lefty still without a win this season, pitched six scoreless innings and exited with a 2-0 lead that was gone almost immediately. Reliever Joely Rodriguez allowed doubles to Will Smith and Corey Seager before Justin Turner’s tying RBI single.
 The Dodgers’ last loss on Jackie Robinson Day had been in 2014 at San Francisco, when they last played that game on the road. They were set to be at home again this year before the schedule was shortened and shuffled.
