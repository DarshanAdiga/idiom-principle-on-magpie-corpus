The Congress on Wednesday demanded the removal of Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa over the allegations of corruption against him.                   Addressing a virtual news conference, Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi said the Karnataka High Court judgment had rejected CM yediyurappa's plea to quash FIRs filed against him over an alleged illegal de-notification of land in Bellandur area of Bengaluru city.                   "Karnataka and corruption go hand in hand. The silence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah and BJP president JP Nadda is mysterious," he said.                   "The arch of immunity accorded to Yediyurappa is shocking," Singhvi said. "We demand his resignation or he should be removed by the Governor. The BJP should free him from all the posts," he added.                                                                             On October 11, he said the Congress had given the example of contractors and people talking of corruption in the matter of an apartment.                   The Karnataka High Court, in its 20-page judgment, said the case against the chief minister cannot be quashed, added Singhvi.                   "But do you feel that any action will be taken against him? No. Because the BJP ruling at the Centre and in the state is indulging in politics of shamelessness," Singhvi said.                   "Don't listen to us, but don't give homilies on corruption to the whole world and keep eloquently silent at all levels when Yediyurappa and Karnataka and corruption intersect and come to the public domain. Have some shame, some political shame and do not practice the politics of deception by providing a special constitutional arc of immunity to your chief minister," he said.                   Singhvi urged the Prime Minister to take action against Yediyurappa. "The whole country is waiting for the Prime Minister to perform his Rajdharma, his constitutional dharma. We will not hesitate to keep on reminding him of his constitutional dharma," he said.

The University of Arizona is hiring New England Patriots quarterbacks coach Jedd Fisch to replace Kevin Sumlin as head coach, multiple outlets reported.

Fisch, 44, joined Bill Belichick's staff in New England this season after a stint as the Los Angeles Rams' assistant offensive coordinator in 2019.                                                                                                                                                                                                          His coaching resume, which goes back to the late 1990s, includes a previous stop in the Pac-12 at UCLA. He was the Bruins' offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach in 2017, taking over as interim coach for the final two games that season after Jim Mora was fired.                                                                                                                                                                                                          Fisch's collegiate coaching experience includes time at his alma mater, Florida, as well as at Minnesota, Miami (Fla.) and Michigan. His other NFL stops include the Houston Texans, Baltimore Ravens, Denver Broncos, Seattle Seahawks and Jacksonville Jaguars.

_We should hold everyone accountable_ by Konstantin Mitov
 Well lovely Arsenal people, I think it’s fair to say that at Arsenal a lot of people have had it easy. Too often one person had taken all the blame, while the truth is, we are where we are for many reasons.
 We made a few critical mistakes this summer once again. Firstly we sold our better keeper, who was at the foundation of our solidity. For a team that doesn’t score a lot of goals this was suicidal.
 Then we signed Willian at 32 and gave him a 200k/week contract for 3 seasons. We gave David Luiz another year, then we went and gave Auba 350k/week. We could’ve cashed in on Laca, and tried to improve our attack, instead we gave deals to Mari and Cedric who we don’t play, and we are stuck with Xhaka for some reason.
 These deals don’t make sense and they showed the lack of preparation for the scenario which panned out. I think Edu has a few questions to ask here. We moved on Raul, because of his close relationships to agents using the club to feed their clients better deals, but Edu hasn’t shone himself in glory, by helping his fellow countrymen to good deals. Remember that we initially wanted Overmars to take his job, but we were turned down. I think Marc realised that the way things are at Arsenal, you are set up to fail.
 Vinai shouldn’t get away with it either because he practically signed off those deals. It’s because we don’t have a proper footballing CEO that understands the industry, not just numbers.
 And this was highlighted when we gave Arteta too much power, which he took and failed to manage properly. He left Ozil out of the side, which was a strategical mistake. It was a bold decision, but it put pressure on Arteta, and questions immediately arose when results started to plummet.
 We lacked a plan for how we will play. We should’ve either set up a formation that works best with what we have, or recruit the players we need to play the system we want. We did neither and, in that case, at least we should’ve given ourselves all the options, and we didn’t.
 Unfortunately winning the FA cup masked again the underlying problems. Players eventually got confused by the constant rotations and tactile micromanagement, so they downed tools like they’ve done before. A lot of those players managed to throw Arsene Wenger under the bus, so Mikel Arteta will be an easy bite for them.
 Just think of how many players have been here for a more than two years and in the last months have gotten progressively worse. Xhaka, Bellerin, Kolasinac, Mustafi, Ozil, Lacazette, to name just a few, some of which have become unplayable. Then there are others who we signed recently to improve our squad, but instead they slumped to our level, like Pepe for example, who was one of the most exciting wingers in Europe. I fear for Partey because this faith could soon catch up to him.
 Combined with the issue that in order to get players to stay we give them huge money deals, who they’re ready to stink out if they have to, we’re in a situation that won’t change overnight. We’re ‘backing’ Arteta for now, but even if we sign two players in January will they instantly make us better? I have my doubts.
 We are either really believing in Mikel or we again have no clue how to get out of this mess, so we just pray it goes away, like it did in the Wenger days. I’m worried who will make the right decisions, so that one year later, we’re actually in a better place.
 Despite the complete lack of confidence in the people who should take the tough decisions at the club, and the fact that not all is Arteta’s fault, I still think we should 100% change the manager as soon as possible.
 It will give us a boost we desperately require, because relegation is a real thing, and it can happen to you no matter who you are. There’s just no measurable statistic that points in favour of Arteta, and our style of play is not only poor, but also depressing to watch.
 I am certain that if we don’t cheap out on the manager, we can get a decent option and I think Rafa Benitez is a great candidate. He has the experience in the league, he’s won things and he’s managed in both ends of the table. At least on paper a proper candidate for the mess we are in.
 Then there are others like Nagelsman and Allegri. Very different in style, but both names that would lift the spirits around. And I am sure with enough money, we can convince Pochettino. He’s waiting for the United job, but who knows how long that will take and if he can inject young blood to our squad like he did at ‘them lot’ and we back him, he’d love to take a dig at Levy for sacking him.
 In the end there are options, and if there is one thing that’s actually positive right now, that is that something is definitely happening in January. Either player wise or with the manager, we’ll see in the very near future.

Casinos and hotels do not receive direct funding from the stimulus package.                                                                                                                                                                                                          “For some reason, people view casinos as licenses to print money so they don’t get considered for aid,” said Nehme E. Abouzeid, president of consulting firm LaunchVegas. “But we didn’t hit 30 percent unemployment and mounting corporate losses during COVID-19 through any fault of our own.

The oil industry was pummeled after travel was halted in efforts to contain the coronavirus, sending demand for jet fuel and gasoline plummeting. Producers were already struggling before the pandemic struck, due to a weak global economy and a market flooded with cheap oil. As the coronavirus spread and Saudi Arabia and Russia mounted a price war, oil prices plunged. Prices recovered but languished around $40 a barrel for months, well below what most producers need to break even. The oil, gas and chemical industries laid off 107,000 workers over the spring and summer, according to a Deloitte Insights study. Oil giants Exxon Mobil, Chevron and others curtailed spending and slashed their workforces.

_The Witcher_ began as a book series before ascending to global prominence thanks to a celebrated video game series. It's now the heir apparent to _Stranger Things_ as Netflix's flagship series (somehow). Paramount's _Sonic the Hedgehog_ may not have been a masterpiece, but it earned enough money and goodwill to warrant a welcomed sequel. Legendary is hoping to turn _Pokemon_ into the next cinematic universe. The entertainment-media industry is changing rapidly. What was once considered geek culture on the periphery is now the building block of mainstream pop culture. Developing technologies are creating immersive consumer experiences. Cross-platform cinematic universes are all the rage and Hollywood will soon need even more intellectual property (IP) to keep it all afloat.

Today, the Commission approved a new listing rule from the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") which fundamentally shifts how companies can access the public markets.[1]  The new listing standard will allow primary direct listings of companies seeking to go public and, importantly, raise capital outside of the traditional initial public offering ("IPO") process.[2]  NYSE's proposal represents what could have been a promising and innovative experiment.  Unfortunately, the rule fails to address very real concerns regarding protections for investors.  As a result, we are unable to support this specific approach.[3]

Many people use the dawn of a new year as a time to create a list of resolutions that reflect positive changes they hope to make in the year ahead.

Blagys, coauthors of the study "Auld Lang Syne: Success predictors, change processes, and self-reported outcomes of New Year's resolvers and nonresolvers," within six months of starting a resolution 46% of people are still maintaining their resolutions.

If you haven't noticed, the 90s blowout is back in full swing. Yep, you heard us: fluffy, smooth hair is here once again to make us all feel like glamorous supermodels or Cher Horowitz from _Clueless_. If you've felt completely inundated by the hundreds of blow dryers and brushes being reviewed all over the internet and by thirteen-year-olds on TikTok, that's understandable. But not all blow dryers are created equal.

The faster transmission of the new variants means that people need to take the existing precautions such as social distancing and hygiene rules more seriously. Hands need to be washed thoroughly and often. Masks must be good quality, fit well, andworn properly. It makes sense to wear them in more enclosed spaces, even if the current rules don’t demand that. Make sure homes are properly ventilated to refresh the air, particularly if people are visiting over Christmas. The extra risk from walking or running past someone outside is minimal, but bear in mind that the closer you are to others, the greater the risk of infection.

Well, do we sell or eat bat meat in North America and the Caribbean? I guess this first ignorant diagnosis could not hold water and could not explain from whence this plague came or to wither it goes, raising eyebrows and launching a whole “pedagogy” of conspiracy theories and unexplained realities. No wonder, the average man on the street, despite his concern for his safety sees it as lies and more lies, and an attempt to control people!! And definitely, the favourite “Fake News” password of the 45th President of the USA did not make it any more thought-provoking.

The Public Health – Idaho North Central District surpassed 7,000 COVID-19 cases Tuesday, 15 days after the five-county region hit the 6,000-case milestone.                                                                                                                                                  That was a slight improvement over the 14-day gap between the 5,000th and 6,000th case, and a marked improvement over the mere seven-day gap between 4,000 and 5,000 cases.                                                                                                                                                  Nevertheless, the regional caseload has more than tripled in the past two months. It took six months for the district to record its first 1,000 COVID-19 cases.                                                                                                                                                  Another 57 confirmed and probable cases were reported in the region Tuesday, bringing the total to 7,042 since the pandemic began. Latah County added 18 cases. Nez Perce County added 15, while Idaho, Clearwater and Lewis counties added 14, five and five, respectively.                                                                                                                                                  Across the boarder in southeastern Washington, two additional fatalities were reported, along with 19 new cases.                                                                                                                                                  Both fatalities were in Asotin County. One woman was between the ages of 80 and 99, while another woman was between the ages of 50 and 69.                                                                                                                                                  Idaho and Washington both began administering the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine this month to frontline health care workers and long-term care staff and residents.                                                                                                                                                  Idaho has administered more than 5,600 doses of the vaccine, mostly without incident. However, the Division of Public Health reported Tuesday that two health care workers experienced severe allergic reactions to the vaccine.                                                                                                                                                  “Both people had a know history of severe reactions after receiving an injectable medication,” the agency said in a news release.                                                                                                                                                  One of the individuals has recovered fully. The other was expected to be discharged from the hospital Tuesday.                                                                                                                                                  Dr. Christine Hahn, medical director for the Division of Public Health, said in light of the reports, the agency is recommending that anyone with a history of severe reaction or anaphylaxis to any vaccine or injectable therapy defer taking the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine until more is known.                                                                                                                                                  “We will continue to update vaccine providers and the public as soon as we know more,” Hahn said. “In the meantime, people without a history of severe reaction or anaphylaxis to a vaccine or injectable therapy are still recommended and encouraged to get the vaccine when it is made available to them.”                                                                                                                                                  More information about the COVID-19 vaccine in Idaho can be found at coronavirus.idaho.gov/covid-19-vaccine.

"We trust what (City Manager Robert Eads) says and what he thinks would be needed now as personnel, but that could also change on his end and his team down the road."

Design 1) "We the People"Capitalizing on the recognition of the first three words of the Declaration of Independence, this copper collectible visually ties the Constitution to the 2nd Amendment by slightly modifying and unifying their copy.  The crown of the round illustrates the American bald eagle along with the Great Seal of the United States to symbolize freedom.  The symbolism continues with the outstretched talons of the Eagle grasping alongside its right spur an olive branch representing peace and the other claw clutching a bundle of 13 arrows (referring to the 13 original states), together they symbolize that the United States has "a strong desire for peace, but will always be ready to protect and defend."

Santa's boots aren't the only ones on the ground, as a few movies close ranks on military themes. An Army toy drive, Officer's Christmas Ball, and veteran-volunteer romance factor into Lifetime's _A Welcome Home Christmas_ , while Netflix's _Operation Christmas Drop_ centers on a U.S. Air Force base in Guam that makes special deliveries. Hallmark salutes the holiday spirit with HMM's _USS Christmas_ , which involves a reporter, a Naval officer, and because you requested a little intrigue, a mystery in the ship's archive room.

Here is the background on this release. The paperless office has not yet come for many Atlanta businesses such as law firms, educational institutions, nonprofits, and others that still rely on paper. Copiers, printers, and other types of office equipment can remain central to business operations. For many, HP is the brand that comes to mind when they think of office equipment. Others are looking for an objective source of business advice. For these reasons, Creative Office Solutions has announced a new blog post on their leadership in HP printing solutions so that the busy office manager can identify the best options for their Atlanta-area business.

Bengaluru (Karnataka) [India], December 23 (ANI): The night curfew imposed in Karnataka is as per the suggestions of the Technical Advisory Committee and to curb the spread of COVID-19, said State Health Minister, Dr. K. Sudhakar on Wednesday amid rising concern over the new COVID-19 strain which was originated in the UK.                                                                                                       "The state health department is keeping vigil on passengers who have returned from the United Kingdom," the minister said.                                                                                                       "A decision has been taken to impose the night curfew in the state. Night curfew will be imposed starting from December 24 till January 2, 2021. Unnecessary gatherings and celebrations are prohibited," he added.                                                                                                       The Minister requested the citizens of the state to cooperate as the decision is taken in the interest of public health and safety. "Detailed guidelines will be out soon regarding the permitted activities and restrictions", he said.                                                                                                       "Health department officials will keep vigilance on those returned from the UK from November 25 to December 22. They will undergo 28 days of compulsory quarantine. Health officials will take care of their health for initial 14 days. After that, individuals have to voluntarily restrict themselves at home", he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       "Nearly 2,500 passengers with 2 flights per day have arrived in the state during this period. Details of the passengers are available and every single passenger will be kept under strict vigilance. RT-PCR test will be conducted if symptomatic", the minister said.                                                                                                       "We have four premier institutes in Bengaluru including IISc and NIMHANS to study the genetic sequence of the virus. Sample of the positive persons will be given to these institutions for study and research will be conducted on a new variant of the virus", said Dr. Sudhakar.                                                                                                       Lashing out at "a political leader" in the state, the minister said that they should get their facts right. "A political leader has issued a statement that 14,000 passengers have arrived from the UK. This is completely baseless. There is no need for the government to hide the data. Politicians should get their facts right before they speak", said Sudhakar.                                                                                                       Earlier today,  he held a detailed discussion with the members of the technical advisory committee. The meeting was significant in light of reports of a new strain of COVID-19 virus found in the UK.                                                                                                       Later, Sudhakar met Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa at his official residence 'Krishna' and briefed the Chief Minister on the suggestions provided by experts in the meeting.

Given what we know about his life and crimes before he went behind bars, the idea that the intervening five years between Campbell’s 2008 sentencing and the 2013 commencement of his legal fight to get the state of Wisconsin to pay for his gender reassignment surgery made him functional enough would be risible if it weren’t so infuriating.

Websites like Patreon and Ko-Fi allow you to set up an account as a content creator (you can decide what the content is) and have people put money towards your goal. You can set an amount of whatever you like, and you reward these donors by giving them swag or maybe a behind the scenes look at development. Sometimes the donations can be a monthly subscription you are making regular content, or a lump sum if you are trying to create a product that can be purchased by the wider community.

The Cougars exploded to a 21-0 lead in the first quarter and never looked back, cruising to the impressive 49-23 win over the Knights at FAU Stadium in Boca Raton, Florida.                                                                                                                                                  “It was a pleasure to be here,” BYU head coach Kalani Sitake said. “The hospitality was awesome. I love this area and the people here were awesome. I also wanted to express my gratitude to UCF for the game. This one just went our way. I know they’re a well-coached team. I think we just think this happened for us real quick. It worked in our favor so I’m glad that we got the win. I’m really proud of our team, proud of our players.”                                                                                                                                                  Although UCF is almost 2,000 miles closer to Boca Raton but the Cougars made themselves at home basically from the opening kickoff.                                                                                                                                                  BYU started with a short return to start the game but then Wilson and the Cougar offense started rolling against the overmatched Knight defense.                                                                                                                                                  Wilson needed just five plays to get on the board the first time with four of those plays going for at least 11 yards. Wilson took off on a QB run and won the race to the pylon for the 15-yard TD.                                                                                                                                                  Many anticipated an offensive shootout, since UCF had statistically one of the best offenses in the nation, so the quick BYU score wasn’t surprising.                                                                                                                                                  But the Cougar defense came out determined to show that its elite numbers were no fluke.                                                                                                                                                  BYU nearly got an interception on a tipped pass on the first play (although it was overturned to an incomplete pass on replay review) but still forced the Knights into a three-and-out.

The oil industry was pummeled after travel was halted in efforts to contain the coronavirus, sending demand for jet fuel and gasoline plummeting. Producers were already struggling before the pandemic struck, due to a weak global economy and a market flooded with cheap oil. As the coronavirus spread and Saudi Arabia and Russia mounted a price war, oil prices plunged. Prices recovered but languished around $40 a barrel for months, well below what most producers need to break even. The oil, gas and chemical industries laid off 107,000 workers over the spring and summer, according to a Deloitte Insights study. Oil giants Exxon Mobil, Chevron and others curtailed spending and slashed their workforces.

The Latest on the effects of the coronavirus outbreak on sports around the world:
 ___
 The NHL has postponed the outdoor Stadium Series game in North Carolina that was expected to be played in February.
 The announcement was made Wednesday as the league firms up its full schedule for a season that will be shortened to 56 regular-season games for each team because of the pandemic. The Carolina Hurricanes had been scheduled to host the annual Stadium Series game on Feb. 20 at Carter-Finley Stadium in Raleigh.
 The NHL says the game will be played in North Carolina at another time.

These pastors rationalize their weakness and soothe their conscience by claiming “virtual church” is a breakthrough harnessing technology to reach the Body of Christ. The truth is “virtual church” is as worthless as “virtual learning.” It atomizes the congregation, leaving it distanced, isolated and abandoned.
 In a shocking testimony of just how pastors have failed their flocks, a Parade magazine poll found only 9% of Christians plan to attend Christmas services.
 Many pastors outsourced the defense of their rights and hired lawyers to convince judges to allow them to do what Christ has commanded. California’s John MacArthur, who began the year by complying with the Flu Fuhrers, finally had enough and reopened his church. There are other isolated outbreaks of Christians standing up to Caesar, but most pastors are happy to keep their heads down, embracing meek and mild.
 Meek doesn’t come to mind with Pastor Spell. He’s willing to pay the price for his refusal to bow to Caesar.
 The chief of police arrested him in front of the entire Life Tabernacle congregation last March when he refused to close the church. Since then Pastor Spell has been arrested or given a summons a total of 33 times. “I keep the paperwork framed on the wall of my office,” he said.
 One Sunday Spell stepped from behind the pulpit to reveal the ankle monitor a judge forced him to wear when he was sentenced to house arrest. That defiance earned him an arrest warrant for contempt of court.
 Sentenced to 90 days in jail for the offense, Spell asked to preach one more Sunday before going to prison. The judge agreed and then backed down. He claimed since Pastor Spell was no doubt exposed to the Flu Manchu from all his unauthorized preaching, the judge didn’t want to risk exposing convicts to this one-man disease vector.

The statistics argument is not as cut and dried. No doubt baseball can’t shrink from its long legacy of official segregation. The actions were an inexcusable injustice to generations of American ballplayers who deserved the right to ply their talents against their Caucasian counterparts, many of whom with Italian, Jewish, Irish and Hispanic heritage.                                                                                                                                                  MLB officials said they considered input from the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum, the Negro League Researchers and Authors Group and others in arriving at their decision.

It merely stated that the Assembly had some "serious issues" to discuss.                                                                                                                                                                                                           Mr. Khan asked the government for more specificity. In response to the note, the government "opened up partially". It "admitted" that the important was the ongoing protest by farmers around New Delhi. "It became clear that you (Chief Minister) wanted this special session to discuss a problem for which you have no jurisdiction to offer any solution,” Mr. Khan said.                                                                                                                                                                                                           Mr. Khan said Mr. Vijayan had made several assertions about constitutional issues, which he never raised. He was pained to see Mr. Vijayan's confidential letter to the Governor leaked to a news channel before it reached him. The Chief Minister had not replied to his queries but dwelled on extraneous issues instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                           Mr. Khan reminded Mr. Vijayan that the government had held back the approval for an Ordinance to amend the Kerala Police Act to curb libellous posts for three weeks hoping the government would reconsider it. "But finally I signed it, and the public outcry forced you to withdraw it within one week,” he said. A similar fate had met the Ordinance for the reorganisation and delimitation of local body constituencies in 2019.                                                                                                                                                                                                           The Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) and the government had found themselves on the same page for once in their opposition to the Governor's decision not to give his assent for the special session. UDF MLAs convened in front of the Assembly under the leadership of Oommen Chandy. They passed a resolution criticising Mr. Khan's refusal. The Chief Minister-led Left Democratic Front (LDF) Ministers and legislators staged a protest against the farm laws at the Martyr's Column. They did not openly criticise Mr. Khan.

KEOKUK – For 31 years, Kirk Rawlins has been selling Christmas trees in Keokuk, and this year is no exception, in spite of the uncertainty of the times. “Sales have been pretty good,” he stated, “and I’ve sold several hundred so far.” Although his main business is pouring concrete, specializing in new home construction and small commercial businesses in the Beardstown, Ill., area, “several hundred trees” sounds like a lot, but we find out it takes a lot of hard work and patience before a tree can be harvested.
 The Christmas tree business is actually in Rawlins’ blood. His parents, Rick and Teresa Rawlins, started their first tree farm in 1968. “I grew up in the tree business,” he said, “starting working in the tree field at 11, trimming and pruning. All pines have to be trimmed and pruned in the month of June, and working in temperatures in the 80s was hot work.” Then, when he was a sophomore in high school, his parents rented him five acres and he started his own tree farm. It takes from seven to 11 years to raise a tree for sale, so he learned patience at an early age.
 Now he and his wife Susan own three Christmas tree farms, two in Beardstown and one in Westfield, Wis. On the Wisconsin farm they raise Fraser, balsam, and concolor fir trees, while on the Beardstown farms they raise Scotch pine, white pine, red pine, and Norway spruce. Besides the Keokuk lot, they also have a lot in Pittsfield, Ill., which they have had for 34 years. Susan runs that lot.
 “My parents had a Christmas tree lot in Macomb, Ill., and had been selling there since the mid-1970s,” he explained. “My dad had a lot of Keokuk people driving to Macomb just to buy his trees, so when I heard about a new Walmart opening in Keokuk some 31 years ago, I looked into it and we’ve selling here since then.” When Walmart moved to its present location, Rawlins moved his tree lot by the new store and he continues to sell trees in this area.

ISLAMABAD, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 23rd Dec, 2020 ) :The government is in close liaison with leading COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers, also those from China and regularly reviewing developments data of phase-III trials.                                                                                                                                                                                                           This was informed to National Command and Operation Center (NCOC) on Wednesday by the official concerned who further apprised that these steps will lead to a final decision about early availability of the vaccine for Pakistan.                                                                                                                                                                                                           Meanwhile, the government had already completed all prerequisites to submit the vaccine request to GAVI, through the COVAX facility, a coalition for equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines by all countries.

China continues to enhance its scrutiny of domestic Big Tech. On Dec. 14, China’s State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) levied its first-ever sanctions on tech companies for failing to preclear past acquisitions made under variable interest entity (VIE) structures. VIEs are ownership structures that allow companies to circumvent limits on foreign investment and to list on foreign stock exchanges. Most large Chinese tech companies—including Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu and ByteDance—use VIEs. According to a recent study, Chinese companies’ VIE structures in the Cayman Islands had a stock market capitalization of $1.7 trillion as of 2017. Earlier this year, the SAMR gave its first official approval of a merger under the VIE structure. The recent fines indicate Chinese regulators’ intent to take VIEs out of their previous regulatory gray zone. Their new legal status may make VIEs more stable for investors but less flexible for executives.

I hope everyone can honor their own holiday traditions this year, even if they have to do them a little differently.

Speaking to ANI Badamikar said, "Worldwide we generate around 1 billion scrapped tyres every year. So, I started thinking as to what can be made from tyres that can be used on a daily basis and at the end footwear was my conclusion."                                                                                                                  Badamikar left her job with an IT company to start her own business in 2018 and ultimately in the same year she was awarded the Upcoming Woman Entrepreneur award with Start-Up in India competition. By recycling the tyre into footwear the environment has been saved in many ways, says Badamikar.                                                                                                                  "Conventionally we use version rubber or plastic material as sole for footwear but we have replaced it with upcycled tyre and by that, we are helping to reduce the landfills, secondly we are helping to reduce the material like plastic to come to market and the third thing is we are reducing the use of resources such as oil and water which otherwise might have been consumed for manufacturing of that plastic or version rubber," said Badamikar.                                                                                                                  "This is an alarming condition for all of us because the garbage levels are increasing around us, we have to reduce it and up cycling is the key to the new world," she added.

This group limited the passing windows and played a lot of coverage as well.

Columbus police say officers were dispatched at 1:37 a.m. after a non-emergency call from a neighbor in the 1000 block of Oberlin Drive on the Northwest Side. The person reported a man sitting in an SUV, turning the vehicle on and off. When police arrived, they found an open garage and a man inside.

The Congress on Wednesday demanded the removal of Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa over the allegations of corruption against him. Addressing a virtual news conference, Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi said the Karnataka High Court judgment had rejected CM yediyurappa's plea to quash FIRs filed against him over an alleged illegal de-notification of land in Bellandur area of Bengaluru city. "Karnataka and corruption go hand in hand. The silence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah and BJP president JP Nadda is mysterious," he said. "The arch of immunity accorded to Yediyurappa is shocking," Singhvi said. "We demand his resignation or he should be removed by the Governor. The BJP should free him from all the posts," he added. On October 11, he said the Congress had given the example of contractors and people talking of corruption in the matter of an apartment. The Karnataka High Court, in its 20-page judgment, said the case against the chief minister cannot be quashed, added Singhvi. "But do you feel that any action will be taken against him? No. Because the BJP ruling at the Centre and in the state is indulging in politics of shamelessness," Singhvi said. "Don't listen to us, but don't give homilies on corruption to the whole world and keep eloquently silent at all levels when Yediyurappa and Karnataka and corruption intersect and come to the public domain. Have some shame, some political shame and do not practice the politics of deception by providing a special constitutional arc of immunity to your chief minister," he said. Singhvi urged the Prime Minister to take action against Yediyurappa. "The whole country is waiting for the Prime Minister to perform his Rajdharma, his constitutional dharma. We will not hesitate to keep on reminding him of his constitutional dharma," he said.

The fact that the sentiments in this editorial have come to be associated with a major retailer may seem ironic. Yet, calls to reject consumerism at Christmas have been around ever since it became a commercial extravaganza in the early 19th century, which is also when buying presents for kids became a key part of the holiday. How to explain this? Today, just as in premodern Christmases, overturning norms during this special time helps to strengthen those same norms for the rest of the year. The Santa myth not only gives kids a reason to profess the reassuring belief that magic is still out there in our disenchanted-looking world, it also transforms holiday purchases from expensive obligations into timeless symbols of love and enchantment. As historian Stephen Nissenbaum puts it, from the beginning of Santa Claus's popularization, he "represented an old-fashioned Christmas, a ritual so old that it was, in essence, beyond history, and thus outside the commercial marketplace." Kids' joyful wonder at finding presents from Santa on Christmas morning does more than give adults a taste of magic, it _also_ makes our lavish holiday spending feel worthwhile, connecting us to a deep, timeless past--all while fueling the yearly injection of funds into the modern economy.

Is it fair? Maybe not, but not everything in life is fair. This isn't the first presidential election whose results have been questioned, and it likely won't be the last.

As the coronavirus sent people running for cover last spring, Joe Owen ran to help others. The Danville soccer coach trotted up Mount Diablo (13 miles and 3,400 feet of climbing) every day in April to raise more than $4,400 for a local food bank.

For those of us who believe in positive thinking, 2020 put that philosophy to a test.

But those searching for good news could find plenty in our great outdoors, which gained new appreciation from many cut off from indoor activities and international travel.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ▪ Four California cyclists biked from coast to coast on a journey of discovery.

December 23, 2020 (LifeSiteNews) - Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano, in a new interview with LifeSite, comments on LifeSite's report that since the first coronavirus lockdown in March, Pope Francis is not anymore using the papal altar in St. Peter's Basilica for his public Masses, an altar which is situated on top of St. Peter's tomb. Instead, the Pope is using another altar at the basilica. For Vigano, this papal act is symbolic in light of the fact that Pope Francis himself ordered during the closing Mass of the October 2019 Amazon Synod that a bowl of plants dedicated to the false goddess Pachamama be placed on that very papal altar at St. Peter's. Not long after that act, the Pope also decided that he would no longer use the title "Vicar of Christ" in the 2020 Vatican Yearbook.

La decisione del Collegio di Garanzia del Coni di annullare, senza rinvio, le sentenze che infliggevano lo 0-3 a tavolino e un punto di penalizzazione al Napoli per non essersi presentato a Torino, lascia "indifferente" la Juventus. Lo si apprende in ambienti vicini al club bianconero in cui si fa notare che la vicenda e sempre stata "estranea" al club che - si osserva negli stessi ambienti - si presento al campo all'ora e nella data prevista dal calendario della Serie A.

CAPE GIRARDEAU, Mo. (KFVS) - In its second week of availability to the public, the coronavirus vaccine is steadily making its way to the public.During Monday’s city council meeting, Cape Girardeau Mayor Bob Fox encouraged residents to take the virus vaccine upon availability.“I would encourage citizens to think seriously about getting the vaccine for COVID,” said Fox.Fox recently battled the virus himself.He said he knows people are worried about the vaccine’s side effects; however, that shouldn’t the main focus.“Everything you take, whether it’s an over the counter drug or prescription drug, has some side effects,” he said.He said most side effects are rare and they don’t affect a lot of people.“We need to protect ourselves. We need to protect our families and those we love. And those we work with,” Fox added.Ward 1 Councilman Dan Presson also reminded residents to protect themselves over the holidays.“It’s going to be a weird holiday season. It’s not going to always be the most fun. It’s not going to be a regular time. But hopefully we only have one, where it’s an off-holiday season,” said Presson.Presson said everyone should be extra thankful for the local medical professionals who continue to work hard by following CDC guidelines to stop the spread of the virus.“So, everybody band together, socially distance, wear your masks and use hand sanitizer. Wash your hands. It’s for the good of everybody, it’s for the good of your family,” he said.Mayor Bob Fox has recovered since testing positive for COVID-19 on November 9.Copyright 2020 KFVS.

Some may have noticed a flurry of activity at the Keokuk mall, at a storefront to the right of the main entrance. The Crossing, an independent non-denominational church headquartered in Quincy, Ill., opens thrift stores near as many of its church locations as possible, and Keokuk is the latest place to welcome The Crossing Thrift Store.                                          “Our thrift stores fund The Crossing’s benevolence outreach ministry and also provide employment opportunities in the various communities we serve,” said Benevolence Pastor Bruce Freeman. “We have a church here in Keokuk at 610 Timea St., and we hope to a thrift store wherever we have a church.” Hence the new thrift store, the ninth operated by The Crossing, which just opened at the mall on Dec. 16.                                          “Our first thrift store opened in Macomb, Ill., about 12 years ago,” continued Freeman, “and since then we have added three in Quincy, and one each in Kirksville and Hannibal in Missouri, and Pittsfield and Mt. Sterling in Illinois. We are very pleased to have opened number nine here in Keokuk, because each store helps us to help more people in a multitude of ways.”                                          The Crossing stores employ a total of about 75 people at the various locations, and they all operate mostly from donations from their communities. The store accepts donations Monday-Saturday, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.

Southampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl faces an anxious wait to see whether striker Danny Ings and defender Jannik Vestergaard will be fit to tackle the hectic festive schedule. England forward Ings and Danish centre-back Vestergaard are doubts for the Boxing Day trip to Fulham, while winger Nathan Redmond is struggling with a hip problem.Ings, recently back from minor knee surgery, was forced off just before half-time of the 1-0 defeat by Manchester City with a hamstring issue, while Vestergaard has some fluid around his knee and continues to be assessed.With the Premier League fixtures coming thick and fast, Hasenhuttl knows he has to carefully manage each member of his squad to make sure they can make it through to January.&ldquo;It is a little bit early in the week, but we have some issues, definitely,&rdquo; said Hasenhuttl, who is also missing midfielder Oriol Romeu on Boxing Day through suspension.&ldquo;After the very intense last week with three games in six days, you can see that some guys are struggling a little bit.&ldquo;I can only tell you who didn&rsquo;t train so far – that is Ingsy, Jannik Vestergaard, Redmond. Ori is suspended, so we have a few issues.&ldquo;Nobody can play a Premier League game without training during the week, so time is running (out) and we will have a look on Friday.&ldquo;Stuey (Armstrong) had a problem with his hand, with somebody stepping on it. I think it&rsquo;s not a problem, but we have a few issues.&ldquo;It is what it is, so we must have a look in the next two or three days and otherwise find other solutions, which is why we have a bigger squad.&rdquo;Redmond&rsquo;s hip muscle problem is a hangover from Project Restart and the subsequent lack of a proper pre-season build-up.Hasenhuttl accepts such issues were always going to crop up given the circumstances.&ldquo;We had a very intense game in the last one which was by far the hardest test we have had against Man City, and you could feel that the players were really going to the limits,&rdquo; the Austrian said.&ldquo;For a few players this is not an issue. They are so fit and can handle this, but for others it can immediately cause them muscle problems.&ldquo;This is the reason why Ings and Redmond are struggling at the moment.&rdquo;Hasenhuttl, though, understands there is not much anyone can do about the current situation.&ldquo;This is our job as a manager – you can never be sure on the weekend, (one moment) everything is perfect and then two days later everything looks completely different,&rdquo; the Saints boss said.&ldquo;When you work with humans this is always possible, suddenly somebody is ill or injured or whatever, you have to change the team completely, but we are not the only team that has to do this.&ldquo;You see around the Premier League other clubs are also struggling with some injuries.&ldquo;We have to find replacements, this is our job.&ldquo;(You can) never be sure that everything is easy and working easy because sometimes in the next moment it can be completely different.&rdquo;

The oil industry was pummeled after travel was halted in efforts to contain the coronavirus, sending demand for jet fuel and gasoline plummeting. Producers were already struggling before the pandemic struck, due to a weak global economy and a market flooded with cheap oil. As the coronavirus spread and Saudi Arabia and Russia mounted a price war, oil prices plunged. Prices recovered but languished around $40 a barrel for months, well below what most producers need to break even. The oil, gas and chemical industries laid off 107,000 workers over the spring and summer, according to a Deloitte Insights study. Oil giants Exxon Mobil, Chevron and others curtailed spending and slashed their workforces.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The special counsel investigating the origins of the FBI’s probe into the 2016 election now has the authority to use classified information indefinitely in his investigation, a procedural step following his earlier appointment, according to a memorandum issued Tuesday by President Donald Trump.Outgoing Attorney General William Barr named U.S. attorney John Durham as a special counsel in the investigation into the origins of the FBI’s probe of the 2016 election. Durham was already leading an investigation, but the appointment makes it more difficult for the new attorney general to close it. The FBI’s probe morphed into former special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of possible Trump-Russia cooperation.The ongoing Durham investigation followed Trump’s repeated calls to “investigate the investigators.” In May 2019, Trump directed U.S. intelligence officials to assist in that review and gave the attorney general permission to declassify or downgrade information or intelligence that relates to his review.Trump’s memo comes as he continues to propel his claims that the Russia investigation that shadowed his presidency was a “witch hunt.” It’s the latest example of efforts by Trump officials to use the final days of his administration to essentially box President-elect Joe Biden in by enacting new rules, regulations and orders designed to cement the president’s legacy.Barr earlier told The Associated Press that he was naming Durham as special counsel in what turned out to be one of his final moves as attorney general. He resigned last week and his deputy Jeffrey Rosen is taking over on Thursday. The move added a wrinkle for whomever Biden nominates as attorney general, especially because Democrats have dismissed Durham’s probe.Also on Tuesday, Trump appointed Ezra Cohen, of the District of Columbia, to chair the Public Interest Declassification Board. Cohen, a Trump loyalist, currently is acting undersecretary of defense for intelligence.The board advises the president about issues pertaining to national classification and declassification policy.

"As with most things legislative, the stimulus package was imperfect, very late, but better late than never and far better than nothing," Hamrick said. "It would make the difference between an economy that could contract in the first quarter, versus remaining above water.

Today democracy is facing major turmoil in Pakistan where a civilian tyrant is suppressing opposition, squeezing the economy and crushing the economic wellbeing of a common Pakistani, topped by inept governance. One thing Imran Khan must learn from history is that those who make peaceful revolution impossible, can make violent revolution inevitable. Today Pakistan is anxiously seeking true leadership, someone with the stature and capabilities of Shaheed Benazir, who could rescue the nation from the present defunct democracy. The Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) has challenged Imran Khan over his incompetence, revengeful and dictatorial politics and seeks revival of genuine democracy. PDM must be taking inspiration from Shaheed Benazir who stood firm against tyranny twice. The word democracy is incomplete without her. She sacrificed her life for her people, didn’t cut corners and stayed the course. She was a role model, an inspiration for all the young leaders out there; showing that if you stay strong together no matter how difficult the situation, the impossible can be made possible.

“Given the enormous economic challenges facing many in our state as a result of COVID-19, state programs like Help for Illinois Families are being provided to help residents across our communities make ends meet,” said DCEO Director Erin Guthrie.
 The General Assembly has expanded the program’s eligibility requirements to boost the income eligibility threshold to 200 percent of the Federal Poverty Level, making an additional 1 million residents eligible for the program. The administration also adjusted requirements to LIHEAP to make it possible for undocumented families to receive assistance through the program for the first time.
 “Since the pandemic has begun, CEDA has seen an unprecedented increase in the number of individuals seeking help with making ends meet,” said Harold Rice Jr., chief executive officer and president, CEDA. “We remain committed to ensuring every family has peace of mind during these challenging times.”
 While many have already benefitted, the administration is urging families to claim the more than $180 million which remains available to help offset costs on heating, utilities, water, rent, food and other forms of basic assistance. To make applying for relief funding easy, DCEO has taken steps to streamline the process, providing a new virtual application process, technical assistance and other infrastructure that allows residents to complete the application from the comfort of their home. A new Help for Illinois Families hotline launched earlier this year offers assistance in over 30 languages, and CAAs provide services in a variety of languages to ensure access for all communities.
 This program remains open and is accepting applications. For more information on how to apply and to find out about relief programs available near you, visit www.helpillinoisfamilies.com today.
 Business Interruption Grants
 The Business Interruption Grant (BIG) program is a $540 million initiative Governor Pritzker developed in partnership with the Illinois General Assembly to provide economic relief for small businesses hit hardest by COVID-19. BIG is the largest program of its kind in the nation and uses federal CARES Act funds to provide grants to businesses in need. The program devotes $270 million for childcare businesses, and $270 million for all other small businesses demonstrating a significant impact or limited ability to operate during the pandemic.
 DCEO, which oversaw the small business portion of the BIG program, recently concluded the second round of applications for grant funding. To date, the department has issued more than $214 million in grants to over 7,500 businesses statewide, using an equity framework to ensure that the hardest hit businesses in the hardest hit geographies would be prioritized for funding. As a result, grants have been deployed to a wide range of businesses representing more than 500 cities across the state, with nearly half of the grants provided to minority owned businesses, $98 million for restaurants and taverns, and nearly $80 million for downstate businesses. Moreover, the program has helped direct funding for the smallest and most vulnerable businesses in the state, with 85 percent committed to the smallest sized businesses, those with revenues of $1 million or less.
 DCEO continues to review applications for the program and will make grants weekly over the next several weeks. BIG applicants will be notified if they will receive a grant award by Dec. 30. More information on the DCEO program can be found at www2.illinois.gov/dceo/SmallBizAssistance.
 As part of the broader BIG program, IDHS facilitated the release of $270 million in funding to aid child care providers across the state through the Child Care Restoration Grants (CCRG). The grants leveraged funds received by the state from the CARES Act, making Illinois the only state to dedicate this level of federal aid for child care programs.
 Beginning in March, the majority of child care programs closed due to COVID-19, with the exception of providers who served the children of essential workers. The CCRG program offered relief to child care programs, with priority given to child care businesses serving disproportionately impacted areas.

Let's not underestimate how club favorite and first-team coach Michael Carrick can help him, from his versatility as a midfielder or even a libero (Carrick himself was occasionally used as an emergency center-back by Sir Alex Ferguson) the former England international can be a mentor to Caicedo, who is already a starter for Ecuador, thanks to not just his talents, but his maturity -- and that's where Caicedo's potential move to Europe is calming. He is someone who begins everything with the psychological aspect of the game. He was raised to work for everything in his life and so he envisions the game as a place of growth, where everything comes as an opportunity -- not a problem.                                                                                                                                                                                                           Again, similar to Kante.                                                                                                                                                                                                           Caicedo, when once talking about the Chelsea star and World Cup winner in this 2018 interview with IDV TV, speaks highly of his tranquility and positive outlook on the game. "[Kante] is calm, doesn't like to argue on the pitch, he just focuses on his game and that's what I like the most about him," he says in the chat and that's something he wants to emulate and how he can possibly flourish -- by not feeling overwhelmed by the pressures of playing in one of the best leagues in the world and focusing fully on his game.                                                                                                                                                                                                           There is no crystal ball. We cannot predict what will happen with Caicedo's trajectory. But at €5 million, this decision from Manchester United -- if it happens -- can be based on the fact that the best possible outcomes far, far outweigh the price tag.

Dann kommt der für das Baugebiet In de Brinke geplante Kindergarten noch hinzu. Bevor das erste Gebäude steht, lassen die Anmeldezahlen für die dort geplanten drei Gruppen – die für die Zwischenzeit in der ehemaligen Franziskusschule unterkommen sollen – den plan bereits voll laufen. Das bedeutet: „Wir werden im Kindergartenjahr 2022/2023 nochmal einen weiteren Kindergarten brauchen.“ Selbst bei reibungslosem Aufbau von Container-Lösungen werde das wegen des Rechtsanspruchs auf einen Platz wohl nur mit einem verkürzten Planverfahren möglich sein. Also mit einer „freihändigen“ Vergabe bei Leasingverträgen oder Kauf von Kita-Modulen statt der üblichen Ausschreibungen, die einfach zu viel Zeit kosten.

Part of the underlying problem we confront today is that the Commission has chipped away at the public securities market year after year.  Exemption after exemption from foundational Securities Act requirements has allowed, if not incented, companies to remain in the private market longer.[4]  Thus, today many companies go public later in their lifecycle, if at all.[5]  For some that do go public, the primary motivation may be to allow insiders to exit their positions, rather than raising significant additional capital.  This private market proliferation results in far fewer investment opportunities for retail investors in the public markets, where there is a more level playing field and where information asymmetries and other power imbalances are alleviated.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The special counsel investigating the origins of the FBI’s probe into the 2016 election now has the authority to use classified information indefinitely in his investigation, a procedural step following his earlier appointment, according to a memorandum issued Tuesday by President Donald Trump.Outgoing Attorney General William Barr named U.S. attorney John Durham as a special counsel in the investigation into the origins of the FBI’s probe of the 2016 election. Durham was already leading an investigation, but the appointment makes it more difficult for the new attorney general to close it. The FBI’s probe morphed into former special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of possible Trump-Russia cooperation.The ongoing Durham investigation followed Trump’s repeated calls to “investigate the investigators.” In May 2019, Trump directed U.S. intelligence officials to assist in that review and gave the attorney general permission to declassify or downgrade information or intelligence that relates to his review.Trump’s memo comes as he continues to propel his claims that the Russia investigation that shadowed his presidency was a “witch hunt.” It’s the latest example of efforts by Trump officials to use the final days of his administration to essentially box President-elect Joe Biden in by enacting new rules, regulations and orders designed to cement the president’s legacy.Barr earlier told The Associated Press that he was naming Durham as special counsel in what turned out to be one of his final moves as attorney general. He resigned last week and his deputy Jeffrey Rosen is taking over on Thursday. The move added a wrinkle for whomever Biden nominates as attorney general, especially because Democrats have dismissed Durham’s probe.Also on Tuesday, Trump appointed Ezra Cohen, of the District of Columbia, to chair the Public Interest Declassification Board. Cohen, a Trump loyalist, currently is acting undersecretary of defense for intelligence.The board advises the president about issues pertaining to national classification and declassification policy. Created by Congress, the board is tasked with promoting robust public access to materials that document U.S. national security decisions and activities.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.
