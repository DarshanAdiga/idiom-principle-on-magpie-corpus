The executive board of the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) has deferred its decision on the fate of this year's Asia Cup T20 with Sri Lanka offering to host the event, claiming that original hosts Pakistan have agreed to the proposal. Sri Lanka cricket chief Shammi Silva has claimed that the Pakistan Cricket Board as well as the ACC are in agreement that the island nation can host the tournament. The event is scheduled in September and while it is the PCB's turn to host, shifting it to another country seems inevitable considering that India would not travel to Pakistan.
 "We had a discussion with Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and they have already agreed to our hosting this edition due to the present world situation," Shammi Silva was quoted as saying by Sri Lankan media outlet 'Ceylon Today'. "We had an online ACC meeting and they basically gave us the green light to host the tournament," he added.
 It is understood that the ACC will wait for the ICC's decision on the T20 World Cup in Australia (October-November) before taking a call on the Asia Cup. "...the Board emphasised on the importance of holding the Asia Cup 2020. In light of the impact and consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, possible venue options for the Asia Cup 2020 were discussed and it was decided to take the final decision in due course," an ACC press release stated after the meeting on Monday.
 The ACC board meeting was chaired by Bangladesh Cricket Board president Nazmul Hasan Papon and it was the first continental meeting attended by BCCI president Sourav Ganguly (board member) and secretary Jay Shah (ex officio). A senior ACC official privy to developments said there were discussions regarding postponement but no consensus could be reached as far as alternate dates of holding the tournament in Sri Lanka were concerned.
   
   
 Among other topics discussed were ACC's involvement in 2022 Asian Games in China. "The Board was also apprised of the status and progress of the ACC's involvement with the Asian Games 2022 in Hangzhou, China," it stated.

Starting this week, ABC News will rent some of its Washington, D.C., bureau facilities to Retirement Living TV, a cable channel targeted toward the 55-plus set.
 According to an internal announcement Wednesday, Retirement Living will rent production facilities and work space, including the Green Room and makeup rooms, as well as studio and control-room space.
 Retirement Living will produce a two-hour live show, _Daily Café_ , out of the ABC facilities.
 "Retirement Living’s production group is scheduled to begin moving into their offices this week," the memo said. "RLT’s set will arrive Feb. 18 and the program is scheduled to begin airing March 3."
 ABC moved the bulk of _Nightline_ production to New York, and _This Week is moving to studios at the Newseum_. But the Retirement Living space is separate from those production operations, an ABC spokeswoman said.
 Retirement Living will use a general-purpose studio that ABC previously used as an interview facility.
 A decade or so ago, according to a longtime staffer, ABC rented out some of its D.C. bureau studio space to third parties until New York put the kibosh on that, saying that it needed to be ready at a moment's notice to report news out of those studios.
 An ABC spokesperson confirmed the deal and said the network would continue to be a 24/7 news operation in Washington and it will use a new state-of-the-art control room that has been up and running for about one month. ABC has not ruled out renting studio space to others, she added.
 After _This Week_ moves to its new digs, ABC will use that studio -- a large basement studio and former home to the Ted Koppel-hosted _Nightline_ \-- as a general purpose facility.

The retransmission-consent rhetoric is flying in Orlando, Fla., as Post- Newsweek Stations’ WKMG and cable operator Bright House Networks are clashing over delivering the station’s signal.
 According to Bright House’s Web site, WKMG will yank its signal March 17 if an agreement is not worked out.
 The WKMG home page features a bright-red button saying, “Keep CBS on the air! Get the Facts!” A message from general manager Henry Maldonado implored viewers not to let Bright House “pull the plug” on CBS. “Bright House is charging you for our free signal,” it read.
 The message continued, “It is unfortunate that Bright House has decided to publish untruths in order to alarm its customers and scare them into believing that as a result of these negotiations, Bright House will have to raise its rates.”
 WKMG also provided a form letter addressed to Bright House that viewers can print and send.
 For its part, Bright House has a phone message assuring subscribers that the cable operator is “holding the line against organizations that attempt to raise fees.”
 Bright House then suggested that Orlando viewers check out the Web site standupforyou.mybrighthouse.com.
 “We have offered WKMG TV Local 6 creative solutions that do not impact customer rates,” that site said. “They keep coming back demanding a fee that will force our customers to pay more for what others get for free. We continue to believe we will find the appropriate agreement that will not impact our customers’ rates.”
 Neither party returned a call at press time.

 "However, to be crystal clear, wearing a face covering does not replace the need for social distancing or washing your hands regularly.
 “Further scientific evidence is needed on the benefits to the wider public of wearing face coverings, but observational findings so far suggest that homemade or purchased three-layer face-coverings might reduce transmission from one person to another if made, worn, handled and disposed of properly.

 In recent decades companies have increasingly paid attention to corporate responsibility, including taking steps to limit their carbon footprint in light of climate change. Sometimes those actions are based on a true belief by leadership that it’s the right thing to do. Other times it may simply be based on the cold financial calculation of knowing reliance on fossil fuels will become increasingly untenable and expensive.
 Either way, the results are beneficial to society.

"articleBody": "
 Niagara has one major mall that's up and running and it's going to remain that way for now.
 There's more security, one-way aisles and limits on the number of people who can enter stores, but Outlet Collection at Niagara has most of it retailers open since COVID-19 shut the province down.
 "We've upped security a lot since opening," said the mall's general manager, Joanne Ross.
 "I was so pleased this weekend in the flow of traffic. People are taking it seriously.
 "I've seen a lot of social distancing. Customers are coming out wearing masks."
 On Monday, the province announced malls would be allowed to reopen as part of Stage 2 of Ontario's COVID-19 reopening strategy -- but Niagara was one of the regions exempt.
 Shoppers have been able to go to Outlet Collection at Niagara though, because the outdoor mall and has exterior entrances for all its stores.
 Ross said 76 of the Niagara-on-the-Lake mall's 113 retailers were open Monday.
 The mall has floor markings for one-way aisles, signage and extra security to help with line ups outside of stores that have limited capacity based on square footage.
 At Nike, for instance, Ross said a secondary line was created so people could wait in front of the store and in the aisle way with space between them.
 While the number of patrons aren't what they were pre-COVID-19, new safety measures do mean there are waits. At one point, it was an hour to get into Nike, which opened last week.
 Ross said consumers have gotten used to lineups for grocery stores and essential services.
 "I think from our shopper perspective, shoppers are coming in with their patience," she said.
 "They know the health and safety is first and foremost and that's our philosophy as well, the health and safety of everyone in the building and people are respecting it."
 Canada One Outlets in Niagara Falls also has stores open due to its outdoor setup.
 Indoor malls have been allowed to open stores that have exterior entrances.
 In recent weeks, The Pen Centre in St. Catharines has seen The Bay, George Richards, HomeSense and Urban Barn open. Chapters reopened at Fairview Mall, also in the city.
 An announcement that Niagara's interior mall stores can open won't come soon enough for some.
 "It's getting tougher and tougher as each day goes by because right now in every city in Niagara, all the retail is open except for shopping centres," said Seaway Mall president Michael Belcastro.
 He said it's particularly difficult when every week another retailer files for protection. The Welland mall is patiently waiting for an announcement from the premier.
 "Everybody is getting a little bit nervous at this point. The longer it takes for us to reopen, the bigger trouble we're going to have."
 When an announcement does come, Belcastro said the mall is prepared for it. It has put stickers on its floors with arrows for social distancing and set up spaces for people to wait in lines. He said a lot of national retailers have been inside their stores bringing in new inventory so they're ready if there's a quick opening date.
 "If they said we had to open tomorrow morning or in two days we'd be able to do it," he said.
 Shopping centres and malls that open in other parts of Ontario are expected to take safety measures.
 Those include limiting the number of people inside a store, implementing a cleaning process between fitting room customers, having hand sanitizer at the entrances of buildings, removing benches and gathering areas, creating and enforcing traffic walking patterns and other measures.

 "I can’t tell you whether we’re going to end up with one or two websites," Sowden said.

Local TV is the most effective video-advertising platform, Hearst-Argyle Television reported, as well as the biggest audience draw for news and information.
 Hearst-Argyle, which owns 26 stations, released a part of a survey at the Association of National Advertisers conference in New York Thursday. The broadcaster partnered with Frank N. Magid Associates on the study, which polled 2,700 local news viewers 25-54.
 According to the survey, which Hearst-Argyle president and CEO David Barrett discussed at the conference, 55% of respondents cited TV as their primary source of news information, ahead of the Web (26%) and print newspapers (14%). (Portals such as Google were not included among the “Web” category.)
 Furthermore, local TV is more “DVR-proof [digital-video recorder]” and a more effective tool for advertising, the study noted. “The greater loyalty audiences have toward local broadcast-TV news is a factor in the effectiveness of advertising within the genre,” it read, “and ads on local TV news drive greater product/service awareness than those within any other program type.”
 Other findings showed that search engines are the top destination for local news and weather, followed by local-TV-news Web sites. And 37% of those surveyed viewed local-TV-news content online, ahead of cable news and primetime programs (both 31%), and network news (23%).
 “Marketers are seeing renewed enthusiasm for TV as a source of news and other content, and that TV broadcasters now have wonderful resources to leverage on their behalf to reach audiences with local content they want,” Barrett said. “These findings indicate that marketers can seize an advantage and use new digital technologies such as broadband and DTV spectrum to geo- and micro- target their messages, and they can do it with video-content providers who have exceedingly strong, trusted on-air, online and mobile-content brands in key local markets.”

LAMAR COUNTY, Miss.

"These smaller trees will be taken out, which will give us more sight distance from up at the curb at the corner of the fence looking back towards Bellevue. Scruggs Road will actually go up here. Part of Scruggs Road going out to Highway 589 will be taken completely out and you will make either a left or right turn.”Members of the community say they are excited to see things finally moving forward.“It’s much needed, and I think it will be a big safety improvement for our community," Thames said.The project also includes the repaving of the Westbrook community.It will cost around $863,000. Once started, it is expected to take about three months to complete.Copyright 2020 WDAM. All rights reserved.

But when the president went there, originally to sign an executive order in support of religious freedom as international policy, the White House canceled the remarks that would have put it all in context. If you were watching live on C-SPAN, all you saw were the president and the first lady posing for pictures and looking at a statue outside the shrine. Only later did we see photos of them in prayer inside, and speaking to a nun.
 The Catholic archbishop of Washington said it was “baffling” and “reprehensible” for a Catholic institution to host the president that day. The event had been planned in advance, and after a few days of setting up the place, it would have been a breach of protocol, to say the least, to somehow insist that morning that the president not come.
 The White House should have canceled the visit for many reasons, including respect for the Knights of Columbus, whose commitment to the persecuted and the vulnerable of all colors and in all stages of life is a model for all of us.
 If we truly believe that black lives matter and that all lives matter, we are going to have to consider what can unite us and quit being dishonest and bungling opportunities for healing. A deep breath. Actually opening a Bible to pray. These are called for. These would help.

For the first time in a long time, COVID-19 became part of the set design, still on stage but no longer in the spotlight.
 The deadly virus that has consumed nearly everyone's attention on an around- the-clock basis for three months had been supplanted, at least for the moment, in the public consciousness by something equally insidious - structural racism.
 The Memorial Day killing of George Floyd, a unarmed black man in the custody of white Minneapolis cops, touched off daily protests around the country last week, including in Boston where perhaps the largest protest on Sunday unfolded peacefully until after curfew, when some demonstrators clashed violently with cops and looted and vandalized businesses in downtown Boston.
 That incident, and ones like it in American cities from Washington, D.C., to Los Angeles, from Brockton to Lowell, set the tone for an uneasy week on two fronts - race relations and public health. Social distancing norms that had become commonplace went out the window as people gathered to make their voices heard, though for the most part masks remained.
 And the "balancing act" that Gov. Charlie Baker described between respecting the First Amendment and remaining vigilant against the virus tipped toward free speech.
 U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren said white people need to be more than allies to the black community. They need to be "anti-racists," she said. And Boston Mayor Marty Walsh quoted from the Serenity Prayer, telling white Bostonians to "just listen" to their black neighbors and coworkers.
 Things were also tense between the White House and, well, a lot of people.
 Trump told governors on Monday they were "weak" and being made to look like "jerks" by the protesters. You have to "dominate" the demonstrators, the president said on a conference call with governors, later threatening to send in the military if states couldn't handle it on their own.
 Baker has often joined these calls during the pandemic, but skipped this one as he prepared for a press conference during which he addressed the protests the night before and an executive order he signed more clearly spelling out the rules for retailers, child care centers and other industries to reopen in Phase 2.
 That he didn't hear the president's words firsthand, however, didn't stop Baker from directly addressing the rhetoric emanating from the White House, offering a rare and forceful public rebuke of Trump, who he usually prefers to just ignore.
 "I know I should be surprised when I hear incendiary words like this from him, but I'm not," Baker, a Republican, said during his opening comments Monday. "Like so many times during these past several weeks, when the country needed compassion and leadership the most, it was simply nowhere to be found. Instead, we got bitterness, combativeness and self-interest."
 U.S. Sen. Ed Markey called Trump's threat of military force "unAmerican," and Attorney General Maura Healey said, "We don't need soldiers in our streets." The Democratic prosecutor then unfurled this line that should be starred for 2022 if and when Healey decides to run for governor: "Yes, America is burning, but that's how forests grow," Healey said.
 Baker, over the course of the week, thanked those protesting peacefully and said he was working with community leaders and law enforcement to pursue reforms that would hold police accountable.
 He told looters they would have their day in court.
 And he told everyone to be careful. "We are still in the midst of a terribly dangerous and wildly contagious virus and this is certainly going to be a risk," Baker said.
 The risk was low enough, however, that Baker was poised to send Massachusetts into Phase 2 of reopening as hospitalizations and the positive testing rate, now under 6 percent, continue to fall. While it will be weeks before public health officials know whether the protests led to a spike in infections, Baker plans to make an announcement on Saturday on whether to let restaurants, retailers, child care, summer camps, pools, athletic fields and more reopen on Monday.
 The next phase, if it's triggered, came after a surprisingly positive national jobs report on Friday that sent the stock market soaring, and the steady decline in Massachusetts of new unemployment benefit claims, which were down to 27,034 last week.
 While far from assured, a quick economic recovery (without a second surge of COVID-19) would be welcome news for state budget writers who got the word this week that May tax collections were down $262 million, or 13 percent, from last year, and the state is currently looking at $2.25 billion less in revenue than it was counting on for fiscal year 2020, with one month left.
 Most sectors at this point have been given special instructions on what it will take for them to reopen when their turn comes, and Mayor Walsh said he was expecting restaurants to get the green light for outdoor service on Monday, when the forecast currently called for temps in the mid 70s.
 House lawmakers also voted last week to extend an additional lifeline to restaurants, passing a bill that would let them sell to-go cocktails in sealed containers, along with the existing take-out beer and wine service. The legislation would also cap third-party delivery service fees and waive penalties and interest for late meals tax payments as eateries get back on their feet.
 That bill still requires action in the Senate, however. And so does a major expansion of early voting and vote-by-mail.
 The House passed the voting law changes nearly unanimously on Thursday. If approved by the Senate and signed by the governor, Secretary of State William Galvin would be instructed to send applications for mail-in ballots to all 4.5 million registered voters.
 For those who still wish to vote in person in the Sept. 1 primary and the Nov. 3 general election, early voting would be made available before both days, including a full two weeks with two weekends before the 2020 general election.
 The House almost passed both bills on Wednesday, but the House shut down debate over the voting bill as protestors gathered outside the State House and the authorities wanted the building cleared.
 Getting a few lawmakers and staff to head home for the day turned out to be far easier and less controversial than the military tactics Trump deployed to clear Lafayette Square outside the White House of peaceful protesters on Monday so he could visit St. John's Episcopal Church.
 While that was happening, U.S. Sen. Edward Markey and U.S. Rep. Joseph Kennedy were in a television studio in Springfield for just their second debate of this primary campaign.
 In these exchanges, Markey has largely stuck to a recitation of his legislative accomplishments as evidence of the leadership he will provide, while Kennedy has tried to make the case that there's more to being a senator than filing bills and making laws, and he would be better at that part of the job.
 "I co-sponsored the Green New Deal," Markey argues. "But it won't pass unless you flip control of the Senate, and I can fundraise and campaign around the country," Kennedy counters.
 Kennedy, however, also leaned in on Monday night to the perception first raised by moderator Janet Wu of WCVB that Markey is a creature of the Beltway, except around election time, and doesn't spend enough time in Massachusetts communities.
 And while on the topic of elections, the special legislative contests for 2020 are now over, and it was a clean sweep for the Democrats, who picked up a total of three new seats. Five special elections have been held over the past several months, and Democrats won every race, including in two Senate districts and one House district where a Republican held the seat previously.
 This week it was Republican Taunton Mayor Shaunna O'Connell's old House seat going to Taunton School Committee member Carol Doherty, while Democrat Dan Sena of Lunenburg held onto Alliance for Business Leadership President Jennifer Benson's old seat for his party and became the first Brazilian immigrant elected to a state legislature.

As the number of coronavirus cases rise in Goa, villagers have begun to lock themselves at home and ensure a complete shutdown of activity in their villages in the hope that they will tide over the pandemic.
 In began on June 6, when a health worker from Guleli in Sattari, a village located deep in the Western Ghats that line Goa's eastern fringe with Karnataka, tested positive for the virus, people from the village quickly shut down the few shops that make up the village and quarantined themselves in their homes.
 The practice soon spread to neighbouring villages after cases were found there too and culminated in Keri, a village that lies along the border with Karnataka declaring a four day shutdown to "break the chain" of the virus.
 "Yesterday the Keri youth and villagers got together and decided that since the coronavirus has reached close to home they would voluntarily shut shop. The youth have come forward and called the each panch and explained the plan. This is for our own good and our own decision," Laxman Gauns, a panch member from the Keri village, said

 "We have to break the chain of the virus. So we will remain shut for four days. This is not a government directive or anything, but it is our own choice and decision. Those who work outside the village, they should take their own precautions. We cannot take the law into our own hands and they should make their own choice," he said.
 "It's not as if the virus will disappear within four days but we want to do what we can and also spread awareness," he added.
 Covid-19 cases emerged in rural Goa after health workers -- mainly those associated with the Vasco Urban Health Centre began testing positive. So far, 15 health workers have tested positive and five family members related to the health workers also tested positive. Seven hail from the Morlem village neighbouring Keri and one from Guleli.
 A large number of people from the villages of Sattari taluka are employed in the health department.
 On Tuesday, the state government tried to dispel rising fear about the pandemic after the recent spurt in Covid-19 cases. Goa now has more than 300 cases. The director of health told reporters Covid19 is "just like any other respiratory disease."
 "There is a lot of fear that has spread and people are scared and they are scaring others too. It is just like any other respiratory disease and if we can take precautions, there will be nothing to worry. Also, as per our numbers, only 5% of patients show symptoms the rest 95% are asymptomatic. We also have a zero mortality rate and a 100% cure rate," Dr Jose de Sa, director of Health Services, said.
 "There are other communicable diseases in the community, we don't have to fear. But we have to take all precautions and for high-risk persons those who are above 65, children less than five and those who have comorbid conditions and pregnant women, have to be extra careful. Wear a mask, wash hands frequently and routinely follow all precautions," he said.

“Disappointment” doesn’t even begin to cover how I feel about the news lately. A man dies at the hands of police, and what could and should have been a righteous quest for justice broke out into destruction. What could have been a presidential prayer for wisdom, strength and protection became a profane misuse of a sacred text. What could have been a joyful moment in support of religious freedom devolved to a botched P.R. attempt.
 This, needless to say, is a time of unrest. And one of the things that would seem to be bringing people together is the fact that black lives matter. May it be a steppingstone to a new appreciation that all lives matter, and that life is a precious gift. But when you take a look at the Black Lives Matter website, you read an agenda that isn’t quite as unifying. There’s a hostility to the nuclear family — exactly the fundamental unit that I’ve been praying has been undergoing some healing during these pandemic times. The “about” page on the website uncovers a subversive agenda hiding behind euphemisms that somewhat brilliantly — albeit dishonestly — speak to our best intentions.
 And about the president’s Bible photo-op: I can only hope they didn’t think this one through in the White House. Scatter a peaceful crowd so the president could hold “a Bible” (not his, Donald Trump seemed to make clear) in front of historic St. John’s Church, which was set fire to the night before. Where was the black preacher to read from the Psalms? Where was the prayer for divine assistance? Where was the quote from Martin Luther King Jr.? So many things could have been done to help make a step toward peace, but, no. It was clear from social media that some did see it as a statement about religious freedom, but the communication wasn’t universally clear, to say the least.
 Continuing with his awkward-at-best approach, the president went the next morning to one of my favorite spots in the nation’s capital. Back when things were open to the public, I would often make a visit to the John Paul II Shrine to be reminded of the potential of the human person, created in the image and likeness of God. The exhibits there, thanks to the Knights of Columbus who run the shrine, speak to the fact that all lives matter. John Paul II fought for us to see this, traveled the world so people could hear this.

Even with mitigation measures in place, asymptomatic cases make it especially hard to keep the virus away from high-risk residents.
 “I think we’re just fortunate it’s not in every building,” said Patti Cullen, president and CEO of Care Providers of Minnesota. “As everyone knows, it’s a very difficult disease to control because it’s all in the air.”
 Care Providers of Minnesota represents hundreds of facilities across the state, including Oak Terrace Assisted Living in North Mankato. The North Mankato facility has had COVID-19 deaths — some being hospice patients — and recently found asymptomatic cases after testing all residents and staff.
 Oak Terrace’s asymptomatic cases highlighted the importance of testing, which wasn’t as available earlier in the pandemic. Broader testing happened after Oak Terrace staff identified a new positive case in May, said Administrator Drew Hood.
 With the help of the South Central Health Care Coalition, Mankato Clinic staff came to test the facility right away, Hood said. Additional testing took place over the ensuing weeks and will continue.
 The results so far have been 27 residents and 20 staff members being positive, including Hood. He described feeling flabbergasted at his result because he didn’t have any noticeable symptoms and got tested as a precaution.
 As testing picked up in facilities statewide, about 25% revealed asymptomatic positives, Cullen said.
 “That’s a scary thing,” she said. “No one wants to bring it into our buildings, but they have no idea.”
 Oak Terrace’s numbers were the clearest indication yet of the extent of COVID-19 spread in the region’s long-term care facilities. The health department hasn’t released case totals per facility, although lawmakers are calling on the agency to do so.
 The full list of facilities with COVID-19 exposures in the region includes:
 • Pillars of Mankato — Blue Earth County
 • Cottagewood Senior Community Mankato — Blue Earth County
 • St. John Lutheran Home — Brown County
 • Friendship Court — Faribault County
 • Temperance Lake Ridge — Martin County
 • Oak Terrace Assisted Living — Nicollet County
 • Oak Terrace Health Care Center — Sibley County
 • Good Samaritan Society St. James — Watonwan County

The patients were within the age group of 56 to 80 years, out of which 71 percent were men and around 11 people were using vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). VKAs are a type of anticoagulant drugs which prevent the blood from clotting and are commonly called blood thinners.

He didn't shape at all badly when second in a stronger contest than this last week and boasts a solid record in the class of A7, so all looks set fair for a big run. GENTSTOWN MESSI (Trap 2) - 19.51 Swindon Despite boasting experience in Ireland, GENTSTOWN MESSI looked all at sea, but still could hardly have caught the eye any more when runner-up on Swindon debut seven days ago, coming with a challenge only to seemingly lose his bearings and ultimately go down by less than a length. That ought not to have been wasted on the July '18 whelp, and we're hopeful he can sharpen up and go one place better this evening. BEAU JACK (Trap 6) - 21.36 Sheffield BEAU JACK is at his very best when able to build up an early lead and attempt to make every post a winning one, and with those circumstances on the cards this evening we're willing to side with Lisa Stephenson's charge. A comfortable winner in a higher grade in March, he ought to have come forward for his effort six days ago and is fancied to prove tough to peg back.

A variety of organizations, such as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), support the elimination of REMS regulations for mifepristone, which they maintain are medically unnecessary and impede access to medical abortion. The former FDA commissioner, Jane Henney, and physician Helene D Gayle published a perspective arguing that the FDA should reevaluate the REMS regulations, in light of studies that show mifepristone as safe and effective. Some advocates suggest that the REMS process limits the pool of providers and consequently delay care for pregnancy patients, as they must search for certified providers. Finally, some providers are challenging the REMS designation for mifepristone in court.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump and his allies have seized on calls to “defund the police” as a dangerous example of Democratic overreach as he fights for momentum amid crises that threaten his reelection.Key Democrats, including presumptive presidential nominee Joe Biden, are distancing themselves from the "defund" push, which some supporters say is a symbolic commitment to end systemic racism and shift policing priorities rather than an actual plan to eliminate law enforcement agencies. But confusion over the proposal's intent has created an opportunity for the Republican president, who has struggled to navigate the delicate debate over racial justice, risking support from people of color, suburban women and independents less than five months before Election Day. Facing increasing pressure to weigh in, Biden addressed the issue Monday in an interview with "CBS Evening News." "I don't support defunding the police. I support conditioning federal aid to police based on whether or not they meet certain basic standards of decency, honorableness and, in fact, are able to demonstrate they can protect the community, everybody in the community," Biden said. Other opponents of the movement include Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., a former presidential candidate and one of two black Democratic senators, and Rep. Karen Bass, D-Calif., head of the Congressional Black Caucus.NAACP President Derrick Johnson, in an interview, also declined to endorse calls to defund the police."I support the energy behind it. I don't know what that substantively means. As I'm talking to people about the concept, I've gotten three different explanations," said Johnson, who has criticized Trump. "We know there has to be a change in the culture of policing in this country."Democrats are well-positioned to win over the political center this fall, according to Republican pollster Frank Luntz, who said Trump's uneven actions and rhetoric at a time of sweeping social unrest are "killing him."Luntz added, however, that Democrats risk their advantage by embracing policies viewed as radical following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. The handcuffed black man died after a white officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes.Municipal officials in Minneapolis have endorsed the "defund the police" language backed by some civil rights activists and a handful of progressive House Democrats. Protesters over the weekend also painted "DEFUND THE POLICE" in large yellow letters on a street close to the White House. But there was little evidence that the effort was gaining momentum in Congress. Some Democrats described it as bad politics, even if most Democrats shared the desire to overhaul policing.Former Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., a white moderate who lost her 2018 reelection bid, said "defund the police" is "a horrible name" that misconstrues the goal."By starting with the word 'defund,' you've left the impression that you are doing something much more radical than what needs to be done," said Heitkamp, a leader of the One Country Project, which is trying to help Democrats connect better with rural voters.She said the term left her frustrated that "there's going to be somebody who's going to try to find an opportunity in this, especially among the Republican Party, and use it now as an excuse not to address what is a very real problem in America."That's largely what played out as the Trump campaign and congressional Republicans sought to link Democrats to the defund effort."This year has seen the lowest crime numbers in our Country's recorded history, and now the Radical Left Democrats want to Defund and Abandon our Police," Trump declared on social media. "Sorry, I want LAW &amp; ORDER!" The House GOP campaign arm sent out emails condemning "defund the police" and connecting it to Democratic candidates."No industry is safe from Democrats' abolish culture," said Michael McAdams, a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee. "First they wanted to abolish private health insurance, then it was capitalism and now it's the police. What's next, the fire department?"Democrats on Capitol Hill unveiled a sweeping proposal Monday to address police brutality that did not include plans to strip funding from the police. The Justice in Policing Act would limit legal protections for police, create a national database of excessive- force incidents and ban chokeholds, among other changes.Rep. Greg Meeks, a member of the Congressional Black Caucus and a group of moderate House Democrats called the New Democrat Coalition, said Trump's tweets accusing Democrats of seeking to abolish the police are a diversion."It sounds like the guy that's the 45th president is trying to distract from what the real issue is, the brutality and the murder of George Floyd," said Meeks, who represents New York. "And we're not going to allow them to do that."Democratic Rep. Matt Cartwright, who is white and represents a Trump-leaning district in northeastern Pennsylvania, rejected calls to defund the police outright."I don't care how it's named, I'm not for that," he said, while noting he's joined protest marches in his district.Asked if GOP use of the term "defund the police" might erode his support, Cartwright said, "If they can get voters to believe that lie about me, I suppose. Am I afraid of it? No."Trump, meanwhile, is grasping for a strategy that might generate some momentum. A NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll this weekend found that 80% of Americans believe the country is out of control.Some Trump advisers have considered having the president deliver an address on police-community relations and racial injustice, while others believe it would do little good, according to two White House officials and Republicans close to the White House. They also discussed creating a task force featuring Housing Secretary Ben Carson, the only black member of Trump's Cabinet, but that has yet to get off the ground.The people spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.Before the pandemic, Trump advisers believed the president had a real chance of making inroads with black voters, given his support for criminal justice reform and the strength of the economy. They're less confident now. ___Peoples reported from Montclair, N.J., and Lemire from New York.

SEVILLE, Spain (AP) — It’s the one game that divides an entire city. It’s the most passionate rivalry in Spanish soccer. It’s more than a local derby. It’s the “Gran Derbi.” The match between fierce southern rivals Sevilla and Real Betis will be the one to kickstart the Spanish league this week after a wait of nearly three months because of the coronavirus pandemic. Thursday’s game will be the first in the league since it was suspended on March 12 with 11 rounds remaining. The match will be played without fans at Ramón Sánchez-Pizjuán Stadium, the home of Sevilla. Soccer in Spain will officially resume on Wednesday with the second half of a second-division match between Rayo Vallecano and Albacete, which was interrupted last year after fans called a player a Nazi. The Spanish league will be the second top league to return in Europe after the German Bundesliga, which resumed in mid-May. The Premier League and the Italian league will be next in the coming weeks. While the “clásico” between Barcelona and Real Madrid remains Spain’s biggest match, few rivalries compare to the one spurred by the derby in Seville. “Seville is the most soccer-crazy city in Spain,” Sevilla president José Castro told The Associated Press ahead of the match that was originally scheduled for March 15. “The ‘clásico’ is more important because of the clubs involved, but there is no match bigger than the Seville derby. It’s a match that involves a lot of tension and a lot of passion, both on and off the field.” The Andalusian city of about 700,000 people is evenly divided between Sevilla and Betis fans. Both clubs have fanatic and engaged groups of supporters, with nearly 100,000 season ticket holders all together. “It gets crazy here. Everything stops...

The report also noted that there were only six cases of email attacks on NASA in 2019, despite this being one of the most common attack methods in public companies.
 Additionally, in 2019 the company's equipment was lost or stolen 15 times, which Atlas VPN said, may pose "huge security risks since fraudsters have a significant amount of time to infiltrate the device."   However, the company noted that NASA employs more than 17,000 people, and some equipment is bound to get lost or stolen, regardless of cybercrime targeting NASA directly.
 The report also found that while the US government increased its federal cybersecurity spending in 2019 by nearly $2 billion, NASA's cyber security budget decreased by $3.1 million that same year.
 "The fact that NASA had one of the biggest increases in cyber incidents might lead to the conclusion that the decrease in the cybersecurity budget had a direct negative impact," Atlas VPN wrote.

"I'm not one for the dramatic." So says Elisabeth Moss in her Bette Davis-lite portrayal of author Shirley Jackson in the starkly titled "Shirley." That statement is ironic since most of Josephine Decker's follow-up to 2018's "Madeline's Madeline" is a succession of actorly hysterics in service of a Gothic soap opera brimming with lesbian undertones.
 Men! Who needs them? That's the theme driving a script by Sarah Gubbins (TV's "I Love Dick") in which she converts Susan Scarf Merrell's like-titled novel into a dull, plodding fever dream of fact cut with a steady dose of fiction. Yet, her protofeminist approach peculiarly carries as much disdain for her female characters as it does for the feckless, unfaithful men they "love."
 So, what's to like? I'm still kicking that around in my head. Is my ho-hum reaction to "Shirley" due to the underwhelming narrative or the fact that Decker is that rare director whose status as a critical favorite utterly escapes me, a list she's joined on by Benh Zeitlin ("Beasts of the Southern Wild") and Luca Guadagnino ("Call Me by Your Name").
 At least "Shirley" is watchable, praise I'd never foist upon her impenetrable "Madeline's Madeline," although the two works spring from the same idea of real-life trauma inspiring a wicked-brand of artistic expression. In this case, the muse is Shirley's new house guest, Rose Nemser (sinewy Odessa Young), who travels to sleepy Bennington, Vermont, with her aspiring professor husband, Fred (Logan Lerman), to begin married life residing with a couple that's perhaps been wedded far too long. Naturally, the interlopers are catnip for Shirley, a self-proclaimed provocateur, and her pretentious, blowhard husband Stanley Edgar Hyman (Michael Stuhlbarg overdoing the smarm).
 From the get-go, you know the reputable scholars will make quick work of the Nemsers and their newlywed bliss. They never have a chance; which makes the eventual standoff between the elders and the naive kids the equivalent of a lopsided football game. That's assuming the pigskin ever gets tossed around at tony Bennington College, an "all-girls" school where Stanley and Fred teach folklore to a bevy of 1950-era beauties open to a little sis boom bah.
 In turn, Shirley and her new gullible companion, Rose - hired to cook, clean and keep tabs on her reclusive host - conspire to push their men back, push them back, way back. With good reason we learn via Fred's late night dates with bottles of gin and Stanley's countless episodes of passive-aggressive digs delivered on the rare occasion he's not out schtupping the dean's prissy wife.
 The goal, apparently, is something akin to "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf" cross pollinated with "The Shining," as Shirley sneers, swills booze and attacks her typewriter as if it's a stand-in for Stanley's face. I think it's Decker's intent to examine how the outside world directly informs the artist, as Shirley - fresh off her acclaimed short story, "The Lottery" \- draws inspiration for her psychological thriller, 1951's "The Hangsaman," via the real-life disappearance of Bennington College freshman Paula Jean Welden.
 As the novel progresses, the now pregnant Rose - under the heavy influence of smokes and drink - finds herself increasingly identifying with Paula Jean, a woman who had to vanish to finally be seen. As hard as they try, Decker and Gubbins never sell the analogy, despite Moss and Young working their butts off. Both are as excellent as Stuhlbarg and Lerman are unlikable and lifeless. Why did these ballsy women marry such drips? Who knows, and "Shirley" isn't about to tell you. True to most of Jackson's writings, it's a mystery.

Some Trump advisers have considered having the president deliver an address on police-community relations and racial injustice, while others believe it would do little good, according to two White House officials and Republicans close to the White House. They also discussed creating a task force featuring Housing Secretary Ben Carson, the only black member of Trump's Cabinet, but that has yet to get off the ground.

But the more insidious means that are used to maintain the status quo and sweep the conversation “under the rug” are those used to control the conversation. We started out in his country by making it illegal for slaves to read or write thereby excluding them from means of communication on the most basic level. As a result, and here in Texas, that’s how we got away without telling them they were free after the Civil War until two months after the conflict ended. At that point, a Union force landed in Galveston and let the cat out of the bag and that’s where our “Juneteenth” celebration got started.
 Controlling the process of voting — be it through the “citizenship tests” that were administered during the Jim Crow era, the routine purging of voter rolls in certain areas, or the gerrymandering of congressional districts — is also a means of controlling the conversation. We complain that minorities do not fully participate in our democratic system while restricting their means to do so.
 And in the end we look to our leaders for clear communication on the subject but, given the choice between one who readily threatens to employ violence and another who has decided — probably on the basis of the fact that he used to work for a black guy — that he knows what is and isn’t “black,” well, maybe there’s not a lot of help there, either.
 The readiness that others have shown to ascribe the violence to “outside” influences — and I’ve heard that both left-wing and right-wing groups, along with drug cartels, are involved — is also a smokescreen. But if you believe it, by all means talk about that instead of talking about the real root issue and be sure to throw Bigfoot and a Chupacabra into the mix. For heaven’s sake don’t talk about the real reasons for this unrest!
 The characters in Orwell’s story agreed on seven principles for their society and painted them on the barn door. The first principle for their guidance was the notion that “All animals are equal.” Over time, the rules were changed in the dead of night by the pigs and in the end only one dictate remained: “All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.”
 We believe that our freedoms make us a strong society but we can only earn that dignity by protecting the freedoms of others.

Buoyed by the Federal Communications Commission's issuance of a forfeiture order against ABC stations over a nude scene it complained about in _NYPD Blue_ , the Parents Television Council filed an indecency complaint against NBC stations over the Feb. 15 episode of _Las Vegas_ and a scene featuring some naked women running around in the casino with "their buttocks … visible, and only shadows obscure their breasts and groins."
  _Las Vegas_ is a 10 p.m. show, but it airs at 9 p.m. in the Central and Mountain time zones, as did _NYPD Blue_.
 In a statement announcing the move, PTC president Tim Winter, himself a former NBC executive, cited the FCC's recent _NYPD Blue_ action
 “Only less than one month ago, the FCC handed down $1.4 million in fines against 52 ABC affiliates for a 2003 episode of _NYPD Blue_ that focused extensively on an actress’ naked buttocks, a side view of her bare breasts and a full frontal view of her nudity (obscured only by her arm and hand covering her breasts and groin)," he said, "but that didn’t deter NBC from airing barely obscured female nudity during a primetime airing of _Las Vegas_."
 The FCC is expected soon to issue a forfeiture order against Fox for an episode of _Married by America_ , and there could be others in the pipeline as it deals with a five-year statute of limitations on the government collecting civil penalties.

We often worry that asking for help at work is a sign of incompetence or weakness. Plus, in a crisis it might feel safer to keep your head down and not make waves. However, the research finds such worries to be largely unfounded. In one study, asking for help with a simple task had no negative impact on perceived competence. More than that, in the same study, asking for help with a difficult task actually resulted in higher perceived competence. So, not only is it a myth that asking for help makes you look bad, in some cases it can even paint you in a more positive light. While it’s true that seeking help can expose our vulnerabilities and limitations, people are less likely to judge us negatively for revealing our imperfections than we think.

"Under the influence of the cyclonic circulation over east central Bay of Bengal and neighbourhood a low pressure area has formed over the same region. Associated cyclonic circulation extends upto mid- tropospheric levels. It is likely to move west northwest wards and become well marked during next 48 hours," the IMD said.   It said that under the influence of this Low Pressure Area, fairly widespread to widespread rainfall accompanied with isolated heavy to very heavy rainfall is likely over Odisha, north Coastal Andhra Pradesh and Telangana during June 9-10, and over central India during June 11 to 13.   "Due to strengthening of southwesterly flow, isolated heavy to very heavy rainfall is likely along the west coast of India during 10-13 June," it added. (ANI)

Too many academics, commentators and experts have fallen victim to magical thinking regarding our ability to tackle the major societal challenges facing humanity. To wit: many of the signatories to a recent pledge to find societal purpose in business are furloughing employees during the Covid-19 pandemic, paying dividends to shareholders and provoking complaints from workers that they aren't adequately protected from danger. It is time to give up on hopeful stories and get back to basics. If the global pandemic can teach us something, it is to remind us to return to those ideas, like regulation and good governance, that we know work, even if they are obvious or dull. Taxing carbon is not a shiny new idea, but it would redirect investment and effort to low carbon solutions.  Mandating accounting and reporting standards for non- financial measures sounds like an notion from a previous century, but it works. Nobel Laureate James Heckman long ago showed that investing in early childhood education improves social justice and economic productivity. But it has upfront costs. Maybe it is time we listened to him, despite our dislike of taxes. For other global problems, proven interventions are available, but they require effort and sacrifice to deliver results.
