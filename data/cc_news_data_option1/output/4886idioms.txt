The victory not only sealed a first three-point haul in five games but it was the first comeback victory of the Corberan era.
 In fact, the last time Town did so was in their final outing of 2019 in the 2-1 home win over Blackburn.
 That game saw Danny Graham open the scoring for the visitors, only for Jon Gorenc-Stankovic and Steve Mounie to turn the game on its head.
 Naturally, Corberan was pleased with the character shown by his players against Neil Warnock's gritty Boro as they secured a long overdue come-from- behind win.
 Corberan said: "I think we played a very tough game. It was not an easy game against the team that have conceded the least amount of goals in the Championship before the game.

The team started in the spring of 2018 and has consistently competed in events statewide since it began, Josh Sullivan, head coach of the co-ed team, said.
 Sailing programs in Minnesota are not sanctioned by the Minnesota State High School League but governed by the Midwest Interscholastic Sailing Association. The association has three sections and the west division includes 48 teams, mostly Minnesota and Wisconsin schools, though most of the Minnesota teams are based in the Twin Cities. There are two South Dakota teams, Lincoln in Sioux Falls and Dakota Valley in North Sioux City.
 “Our team is very new,” said Sullivan, who is also the waterfront director of the Gull Lake Sailing School. “We’re not a top competing team by any means. Even sailors that have been around for most of that time are still, in the grand scheme of things, novice sailors.”
 The team consists of 16 members, and the team sails April through the first week in June and then the beginning of September through the end of October.

Named after an Icelandic volcano by the Grand Island and Wyoming Central Railroad, the siding for cattle transportation grew into a tiny town that persisted for several decades.
 The Hooker County Historical Society notes the town never exceeded 11 permanent residents. Despite its size, it had a general store, pool hall and school. Those working on the railroad and cattle drives could nearly triple its population -- though they'd often have to sleep in the store or a barn.
 Though the depot closed in the 1930s, Hecla's stockyards operated for another couple of decades. By the 1960s, however, nothing remained at the site where the town had stood. A History Nebraska marker now marks its former location along Nebraska 2.

 “I wouldn’t say that they’re struggling. It’s different conditions, different formats. The pitches in the UAE were way different from the one here. The challenge is to adapt to the conditions quickly... you also have to admit that the opposition batsmen played really well,” said Rahul at the virtual media interaction on Sunday.
 “We haven’t done a whole lot wrong. It’s a learning curve for us... we have to think how we can do better when we play on such good batting wickets.”

İkinci yarı bazı oyuncuların yerini değiştirerek daha üretken olduk, pozisyon ürettik ancak bir türlü golü bulamadık. Golü bulsak belki de buradan puanla dönecektik.

It was around the same time that the army came to Verulamium.
 It’s thought that during the three attacks they killed and tortured thousands, and completely destroyed Verulamium.
 However, despite what historians have long thought about the scale of the destruction, in excavation work carried out between 2010 and 2013, a Roman writing tablet mentions contracts between Verulamium and Londinium, in 62 AD - indicating the towns were back in business within a year.
 Some historians even believe that Boudica’s destruction of the iron age settlements actually pushed Verulamium forward as it could be rebuilt along conventional Roman lines.
 Boudica has, of course, become an iconic figure of the Roman period, and folk hero since the 16th century when works of Tacitus were rediscovered and her story uncovered.
 Even if the story is new, you might recognise the name and imagery - most likely from the statue Boadicea and Her Daughters that sits on a plinth next to Westminster Bridge that was erected in 1902 after being designed by Thomas Thornycroft - who died in 1885 before he could see it take a final form.
 There’s also another statue depicting Boudicca at Colchester Town Hall, which was erected in the same year.

Now, the reality has dawned on us - no thanks to the Buhari government - that Nigeria is one of the most unsafe countries on earth to live in. We got confirmation of this last Wednesday. In a new report published by the Global Terrorism Index (GTI), Buhari's Nigeria is ranked the third most terrorized country in the world. The report said that the number of insurgency deaths in the country increased by 25 per cent from 2018 to 2019. Indeed, said the report, Nigeria was only bested by Afghanistan and Iraq while war-torn Syria, Somalia and Yemen were ranked fourth, fifth and sixth respectively. Not unbeknownst to us, GTI also said that since 2015 when Buhari took over, Nigeria has ranked, for six consecutive times, the third country, all over the world, with worst impact from terrorism. Shortly, the Buhari/Osinbajo campaign office vultures, paid to launder Buhari's blood-soaked apparel, would go to town to devour into unrecognizable carcass the meat of this GTI report.

In his mind's eye, Shekwo must have believed that he and his family were in the clear of bandits' strike as a state party chairman of the Almighty Nigerian president's ruling party. Recently however, Shekwo was abducted at his residence along Dunamis Church, Bukan Sidi, in Lafia, the state capital, by bandits. Last Sunday, he was found murdered. Again, Buhari dusted up one of his feeble crocodile tears leaflets: "I strongly condemn the killing of Philip Shekwo. He was kind and jovial. His contribution towards strengthening the party in Nasarawa State will not be forgotten. May his soul Rest in Peace," the President said again. He "strongly ordered" the Inspector General of Police (IGP) to do the "needful." I am sure the IGP must have enjoyed a good laugh and ordered his best wine to celebrate the mutual absence of spine in him and the president. Then, everything went calm, as usual. I can tell you - pardon my assault on the dead - no one would be apprehended for killing Shekwo. It is a lesson in why, if we fight for and achieve collective, community good, rather than narrow, personal interest, our individual good would be protected and assured.

The guns fell silent to undoubtedly the bitterest local body elections in Hyderabad at the conclusion of campaign on Sunday evening.
 As never in the past, the campaign for GHMC polls witnessed communal polarisation to the maximum extent with the BJP and All India Majlis-e- Ittehadul Muslimeen throwing challenges freely at each other. Close on the heels of its victory in Dubbak Assembly by-election, the BJP was on the upswing compared to previous polls but how much its strength would reflect in end-result was premature to predict because there were 45 eligible ex-officio members who could call the shots in the indirect election of the Mayor. In the direct election by public, of course, the BJP would have won a moral victory if it could not wrest the Mayorship. The rise of BJP was also attributed to the decimation of the Congress.
 The ruling TRS found itself on the defensive in the matrix as, hitherto, its hand of friendship to AIMIM, though not in this election because both their candidates were in fray in over forty divisions, yielded space for the BJP to consolidate the majority vote bank. Barring a common charge against the BJP and AIMIM for trying to vitiate a peaceful atmosphere, the TRS did nothing to distance itself from the latter party. It, therefore, appeared that the battle was between TRS and AIMIM on one side and the BJP on the other. Also, the distribution of flood relief of ₹ 10,000 which was suspended without covering all families could impact its fortunes. The freebies given by TRS government, mainly drinking water and property tax relief, were neutralised by the communal divide of people, sources said.

The way it is, kidnappers have taken over the Nigerian government while Buhari is just a titular head.

The guns fell silent to undoubtedly the bitterest local body elections in Hyderabad at the conclusion of campaign on Sunday evening.
 As never in the past, the campaign for GHMC polls witnessed communal polarisation to the maximum extent with the BJP and All India Majlis-e- Ittehadul Muslimeen throwing challenges freely at each other. Close on the heels of its victory in Dubbak Assembly by-election, the BJP was on the upswing compared to previous polls but how much its strength would reflect in end-result was premature to predict because there were 45 eligible ex-officio members who could call the shots in the indirect election of the Mayor. In the direct election by public, of course, the BJP would have won a moral victory if it could not wrest the Mayorship. The rise of BJP was also attributed to the decimation of the Congress.
 The ruling TRS found itself on the defensive in the matrix as, hitherto, its hand of friendship to AIMIM, though not in this election because both their candidates were in fray in over forty divisions, yielded space for the BJP to consolidate the majority vote bank. Barring a common charge against the BJP and AIMIM for trying to vitiate a peaceful atmosphere, the TRS did nothing to distance itself from the latter party. It, therefore, appeared that the battle was between TRS and AIMIM on one side and the BJP on the other. Also, the distribution of flood relief of ₹ 10,000 which was suspended without covering all families could impact its fortunes. The freebies given by TRS government, mainly drinking water and property tax relief, were neutralised by the communal divide of people, sources said.
 On the other hand, the Congress and the Telugu Desam left their winning chances to the potential of their candidates to swim against the tide.
 The BJP roped in its national president J.P. Nadda, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and Union Ministers Amit Shah, Prakash Jawadekar and Smriti Irani besides a few other national leaders realising that the TRS politics in this election could be a game changer in future. By making deep inroads in Hyderabad, the party saw an opportunity to capture power in the State in next general elections.
 Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao minced no words in criticising the presence of top guns from the BJP. The BJP threatened to convert the old city into Bhagyanagar even as its leaders, including Amit Shah, offered prayers at Bhagyalaxmi temple beside Charminar.

Tua Tagovailoa is inactive for the Miami Dolphins with a left thumb injury, so Ryan Fitzpatrick will start at quarterback against the winless New York Jets.
 Tagovailoa was downgraded to doubtful Saturday after he hurt the thumb on his throwing hand in practice Wednesday. He was limited at practice throughout the week. Reid Sinnett was elevated from the practice squad to serve as the backup to Fitzpatrick, who'll make his first start since Oct. 18. That previous start also came against the Jets.
 Fitzpatrick is 3-3 as a starter this season, while Tagovailoa is 3-1.
 New York is getting its starting quarterback back. Sam Darnold is playing after missing the past two games with a shoulder injury. Darnold was first hurt against Denver on Oct. 1, when he sprained the AC joint in the shoulder on a hard tackle to the turf. He reinjured it at Kansas City on Nov. 1 on another hard hit and missed the next two games. Joe Flacco has started in Darnold's place.

After a prolonged shutdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, theatres have received a lukewarm reception from audiences when they opened their doors on November 10.
 A senior executive of a well-known multiplex chain in India said only 25 tickets per show were being sold on average in Chennai, while several single- screen theatre executives reported that the footfalls had been as low as 20%-25% of the total seats allowed to be sold by the State government.
 “We could only sell 25 tickets per show on average. We hope that the release of Christopher Nolan’s _Tenet_ and _Wonder Woman_ in December and the positive news about the arrival of vaccines will make a difference in the coming months,” said the executive of a multiplex.
 While producers and theatre owners agree that only movies starring big stars can bring back audiences, the fact that actor Nayanthara’s _Mookuthi Amman_ and actor Suriya’s _Soorarai Pottru_ released directly on OTT (over-the-top) platforms to favourable reviews did not help matters.
 Now, the spotlight is on actor Vijay’s _Master_ , which is ready for release, though many in the industry admit that releasing the film in the present situation would not be economically viable.
 ## ‘Catch-22 situation’
 G. Dhananjayan, vice-president, Tamil Film Active Producers Association, said, “It is a catch-22 situation for us. Movies starring big stars cannot be released unless the present occupancy rate of 50% is increased. It wouldn’t be economically viable. We hope that by Pongal, the situation becomes normal and the occupancy is increased by the government.”
 While there were rumours on Friday that _Master_ would release on an OTT platform, the producers of the film, in a statement, said they prefer to release the movie in theatres.
 Hariharan, the manager of one of the oldest and well-known cinema houses in Ashok Nagar, said, “The theatres could have planned the reopening better. If we had opened with a movie starring somebody big, it would have brought back audiences. Now, we are selling anywhere between 80-100 tickets out of the 400-odd tickets in our main screen. People also don’t seem to spend money in the canteen”
 While the producers of big-budget movies are in a fix, this situation could be used by small and medium budget movies, say theatre owners. Ruban Mathivanan, managing partner, GK Cinemas, said, “Smaller movies would anyway struggle to bring in more than 50% of the crowd. They should release their films when no big movies are lined up. The argument made by the producers of big-budget movies that they will not be able to recoup the money invested with 50% occupancy does not hold true for smaller movies.”

Despite India’s bowling unit conceding 763 runs in the first two games, vice- captain K.L. Rahul backed it to the hilt.
 “I wouldn’t say that they’re struggling. It’s different conditions, different formats. The pitches in the UAE were way different from the one here. The challenge is to adapt to the conditions quickly... you also have to admit that the opposition batsmen played really well,” said Rahul at the virtual media interaction on Sunday.
 “We haven’t done a whole lot wrong. It’s a learning curve for us... we have to think how we can do better when we play on such good batting wickets.”
 ## Pandya bowls again
 The only bright spot was Hardik Pandya’s performance with the ball. The all- rounder, who bowled for the first time after recovering from back surgery, got the important wicket of Steve Smith.
 “Refreshing, isn’t it! He starts bowling, takes a lot of load off the skipper and the team,” Rahul said. “Knowing Hardik, he loves to get into a contest and contribute for the team. It sets up the rest of the series well.”

Not all ghost towns stay dead and buried forever -- Meadville is proof of that.
 The town on the north bank of the Niobrara River in Keya Paha County, named after Civil War veteran and early settler Merritt Mead, was never large, despite its early role as a stop for travelers heading west.
 But it endured all of the hallmarks of communities that long ago faded from the map. First, it lost its post office -- twice. Then, its general store closed, too. (We'll get back to that.)
 The toughest blow was the rerouting of Nebraska 7, which connected Ainsworth to Springview, that came straight through Meadville. Though what's known as Meadville Road still exists, it's no longer the major route it once was after being largely replaced by U.S. 183 a few miles to the east.
 Meadville was all but abandoned for some time. But local businessmen resurrected the general store in the 1990s. Though the facility recently changed ownership, it remains open.
 With a park containing a popular river access point, too, Meadville remains on the map despite being a ghost town for many years.

The cluelessness and incompetence of Buhari's government, according to Dr. Uche Igwe, a Senior Political Economy Analyst and Visiting Fellow at the London School of Economics Firoz Lalji Centre for Africa, "has impacted disproportionately the poor in a country that is said to be already hosting a high population of the world's poorest citizens. Considering the increasing prices of food commodities, Nigeria's decision to close its borders, despite being a signatory to the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA), may have been considered as something done in the country's best interest, with the intent of improving local production and agriculture. But even with the continued closure of the border and huge investments in domestic agricultural production, nothing seems to have changed substantially." In the last five years, the price of food items has risen steadily, with rice that used to sell for 9,000 naira per bag in 2015 now tripled up to about 26,000 naira. Everything sells for a lot more under Buhari, consequently impoverishing more Nigerians that he promised to help.

One man dared bite the bullet, for the sake of the wellbeing of the people of Osun. It was former governor of the state, Olagunsoye Oyinlola. In a statement he issued, he went into recent history of amity in transition of power in the state; how Governor Bisi Akande, whom he took over office from, never attempted to set the state on fire and how he, for the eight years of Aregbesola's rule, never attempted the kind of pregnantly weird celebration he planned. Oyinlola had, in the statement, appealed for calm over the tension generated in Osun state by Aregbesola's plan to hold that parallel event to Oyetola's second anniversary celebrations, both scheduled to come up on Friday, November 27. How that appeal to Aregbesola not to fight his brother became an excuse to launch a vicious attack on Oyinlola beats imagination. If you are accused of repeatedly cursing your neighbours and your response to the charge is a curse, how do you want the whole world to view you?

In Nebraska's northwestern corner, a single building remains where a town once existed.
 Immaculate Conception Catholic Church, built in 1887, has stood alone for years, and the occasional Mass is celebrated there. Without the church and its adjacent cemetery, though, no tangible reminder would mark where Montrose -- which peaked at 24 residents in 1910 -- had been in the present-day Oglala National Grassland.
 The town's enduring claim to fame happened before it had even been platted.
 Just north of the future townsite, a U.S. Army guide shot, killed and scalped a Cheyenne warrior named Yellow Hand in an ambush during what became known as the Battle of Warbonnet Creek. It was purported to be the man's first kill, coming shortly after Gen. George Custer's forces were massacred at Little Bighorn.
 The scene would play out time and again during stage shows later hosted by that soldier, who had a prominent residence in the state when he wasn't touring the world. His name was "Buffalo Bill" Cody.
