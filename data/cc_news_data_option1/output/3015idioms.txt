When we're underwriting loans today, not only do we have those reserves, but you're underwriting to a flat rent growth and a different environment. And you can proceed with a lot of caution. So I think the environment is very strong, but you go market-to-market and you proceed with a lot of discipline. But I do believe that for the time being, we can proceed in a very conservative way, probably lower loan to values with interest reserves and conservative underwriting.

We however urge, that given the seeming tenacity of the perpetrators of these evils, our armed forces and other security agencies must up the ante of the fight to ensure our collective, sustainable security.”

By now, you likely have seen the forecast cone from the National Hurricane Center - the track remains just offshore of Florida, comes north and makes landfall in outer North Carolina and then heads straight for New England. A few things to note regarding the track: First off with any hurricane or strong storm in the Bahamas, the entire East Coast needs to be on alert and ready for anything. While the forecast has been fairly steady over the last 24-48 hours, a small change in atmospheric conditions can lead to big shifts in track and consequently large changes to impacts along the Coastline.

Yeah. Thanks, Kennen. At a high level, we started strong in part because a lot of the filings and initial approaches to the site took place before the heavy onset in mid to late March. And so, we were a little bit ahead of the curve. But what we observed during the quarter was a slowdown in terms of the responsiveness, particularly at the site level, as they were closing sites access to people other than essential personnel and the like. And so, that's really what we saw over the course of the second quarter.

Then, Surae tells us how to peep out of windows around the globe, and shares beautiful chalk art a viewer sent in to us. Deena tells us the best time and day to shop at Trader Joe's, and a secret fact you'll be excited to learn! In the exciting finale, we discuss the new "Twilght" book. Deena shares her love for Edward, Surae asks if there's a wolf in the story, and Brian stumps Deena by asking her to do math far too early in the morning.

Covid-19 cases rose in tandem with customers entering restaurants, according to data provided to Bloomberg by Zenreach, which uses wireless signals from cell phones to monitor traffic. But after reports of rising cases emerged, walk-in traffic turned down, the data show. That doesn’t necessarily mean going to restaurants is sparking more coronavirus spread, but it does show how comfortable customers in those markets feel about leaving the house in general.

Engelberger Monche in Übersee
 Das Kloster Engelberg expandierte mehrfach, in die USA und nach Kamerun. Das hatte mit der Überpopulation von Schweizer Monchen zu tun. 1951 waren sie 129 Bruder im Kloster Engelberg. Zu viele, sagt Abt Christian.
 Auch die Gebaude und Betriebe des Klosters seien damals zu gross geworden. Sie gelte es jetzt weiter zuruckzubauen, sozusagen «reduce to the max». Als Benediktiner denkt Abt Christian unsentimental und wirtschaftlich.
 Mit heute 20 Monchen liegt die Belegung im Kloster Engelberg sogar uber dem Durchschnitt der letzten 900 Jahre. In keinem anderen Kloster der Schweiz leben so lang ununterbrochen Monche. Noch eine Superlative.

In 2011, Taapsee had seven releases and five of them were Telugu movies. She had arrived much before she debuted with Jhumandi Naadam, actually. The actress had three films in her kitty by the time her first released. Her popularity soared. Taapsee didn't use South Indian films as a means to enter Bollywood. In fact, in an interview, she did mention that she chose the film not the language. Soon enough Bollywood came calling in 2014 in the form of Chashme Baddoor. A remake of a classic movie by the same name, the movie did quite well at the box office. But it didn't quite open the floodgates for the actress in terms of Bollywood offers until Baby happened.

L'incidente e accaduto verso le 20.20: la tragedia ha colpito la famiglia di uno dei piu noti acconciatori del paese. Padre e madre si trovavano nel giardino della loro villetta, che si trova nelle vicinanze dello storico parco di villa de Reali. Con loro i due figli piccoli, il minore di appena due anni e il piu grande, di quattro, che giocava in cortile, riparato dalla strada grazie al grande cancello scorrevole che cinge il giardino di casa. Gli e arrivato vicino e li si trovava quando, in un attimo, il gigante metallico e piombato a terra. Un cedimento, partito dalla base, che ha fatto precipitare la struttura proprio addosso allo sfortunato bambino.

Homebuilders have seen below-average demand for almost a decade now. From 1959 to 2008, annual housing starts in the U.S. have averaged around ~1.5 mn homes. But after 2008, they have remained below this level for almost a decade. The demand for new homes wasn't lost - the population was still growing and households were still getting formed - but it was postponed. Recent action by Federal reserve has catalyzed this demand and we are likely to see above- average housing starts for the next several years to compensate the under- build during the last decade.
 Most of this demand is coming from first-time home buyers. Behind PulteGroup's 50% increase in total new orders in June was a 77% increase in first-time buyer category, a 48% increase in first move-up category and 21% increase in active-adult category.
 Looking forward, I expect the company to continue posting good net new orders growth. However, it might be slightly lower than 50% y-o-y growth seen in June as some of the pent-up demand vanishes. Also, I believe as the coronavirus scare eases, more existing home inventories could come to the market. Right now homeowners and prospective buyers are not comfortable with the sales process of already occupied homes due to social distancing reasons. At the end of May, the total housing inventory was 1.55 million units, which were down 19% from the prior year. As the situation normalizes and the coronavirus scare decreases, I expect more existing home inventory to hit the market. But even after considering these factors, I expect the new home sales to be significantly above their pre-coronavirus levels over the next couple of years.
 PulteGroup ended the quarter with a backlog of 13,214 homes, which is a 12% increase over the prior-year backlog of 11,793 homes. The total value of homes in backlog was $5.8 billion, an increase of 13% over last year, reflecting a favorable geographic and product mix. Management talked about continued strength in new orders in July which I believe will further help the backlog going into the back half of this year.
