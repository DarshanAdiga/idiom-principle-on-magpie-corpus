How can that even be mentioned in the same breath as sport when real life sports people are sculpted, gifted, fleet-footed creatures who mesmerise us with their sublime talents?

The city alone said it needs 65,000 beds by the end of the April in anticipation of peak infections. To help reach that number, field hospitals at locations like the Javits Center, Central Park, USTA tennis center and the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal will be able to house thousands of non-coronavirus patients. At least 20 hotels in NYC, which have seen business grind to a halt since the outbreak began, have been leased out by city hospitals to house 10,000 beds. The city hopes that in the next phase of leasing hotels and converting large venues, as many as 39,000 beds could be created, in addition to on-site and off-site hospital facilities.

Most communities that have already scheduled town-wide property revaluations will stay the course, but have suspended interior inspections because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Based on the recommended social distancing protocols established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Nashua recently amended its contract with Vision Government Solutions for its 2020-2022 full revaluation and postponed interior inspections of properties.
 Exterior inspections are still taking place as part of the citywide revaluation, said Kim Kleiner, administrative services director for Nashua.
 When arriving at residences or businesses for exterior inspections, Kleiner said the representatives from Vision Government Solutions will be following a select process to inform residents that they are on their property.
 “Obviously it is concerning if you see someone walking on your property nowadays,” Kleiner said.
 She said the worker will knock on the door of the property, step at least six feet away from the door and inform the property owner that they are there as part of the mandated revaluation process.
 “This is considered a legally mandated exercise, so we had to take that into consideration,” Kleiner said of the full, citywide revalution, which was ordered by the New Hampshire Board of Tax and Land Appeals.
 She has received about six phone calls from constituents expressing concerns about the exterior inspections still taking place in light of the governor’s stay-at-home order. Although the interior inspections have been suspended, Kleiner said Vision Government Solutions does not anticipate a delay in the overall revaluation.
 “We understand people’s concerns. The continued health and safety of our residents is always our number-one priority,” she said, stressing the recommended protocol for social distancing is being followed.
 When it is safe, Vision Government Solutions will be mailing letters to property owners asking to schedule interior inspections, according to Kleiner.
 The town of Litchfield is also undergoing a town-wide revaluation process.
 “I think we are still going to be on schedule,” Chad Roberge of Avitar Associates of New England told town officials recently.
 Most of the work will be completed in vehicles and in home offices, and Avitar representatives will not be dealing much with the public, he said.
 “The reval is still on schedule,” said Roberge, adding interior inspections will not be taking place during the COVID-19 situation.
 Any individual property hearings that may be necessary in June will be scheduled via the telephone instead of the town offices as originally planned, he said.
 Avitar employees will also be knocking on doors and then stepping away from property owners when they arrive on-site for exterior inspections, added Roberge.

 The man who once graced the greatest venues in Britain and America walked away after only drawing with Corfield – an opponent he had beaten with ease five years earlier – in Stalybridge, Cheshire.
 He bowed out with an official record of 22 wins and three draws in 31 contests – I have uncovered many, many more. And those statistics were compiled against the very best in the land. Even George Dixon – considered one of the greatest of them all, a pioneer of ring science – couldn’t beat a prime Plimmer.

For the Morales family, the coronavirus outbreak has meant a loss of income as well as schooling. In February, a crane fell at the Los Angeles Rams stadium construction site, where LaQuan Morales had worked as an industrial painter for two years. The accident resulted in workers being placed on temporary standby.
 Morales was laid off in late February. He has applied for unemployment but has not yet gotten benefits with the system overwhelmed by claims. Finding another job in this economic climate has been difficult.
 For now, the family is relying on their savings and Brianna’s income from preparing tax returns. The couple also have an 18-year-old son in high school and a 2-year-old daughter.
 Morales, 36, tries to keep a positive attitude, especially for his family. “If you’re stressed out and upset, your kids feel that ... and it can weigh on them,” he said.
 Sherri Bell, a state employee, has also been attempting to focus on the bright side. The 39-year-old single mother is trying to take advantage of the extra time she has with her 13-year-old daughter as they work and study from home.
 After work and school assignments are done, the two will watch TV or play games of Uno together.
 “Let’s do things that we would probably be too busy to do … on our normal schedule,” Bell said. “We’re at home. We might have a little more energy. Let’s spend it together.”
 She’s had to reassure her daughter that it’s OK to go outside while practicing social distancing. Once, when Bell announced that she was going to the store, her daughter pleaded with her not to go.

The individual instances are petty enough. The Association of Convenience Stores, which represents the country’s corner shops, complained that over- zealous environmental protection officers had been warning store owners against selling Easter eggs – saying that these were “non-essential”.
 Sure enough the officials were enforcing an imaginary law, and an imaginary piece of guidance, and weary press officers at 10 Downing Street quickly batted it down, stressing that if a shop had been deemed ‘essential’ and so could remain open – which corner shops had – it could sell whatever it usually sold.
 Similar over-zealousness abounds. In Edgware, footage emerged of a police officer berating a shop worker who was chalking the pavement to mark how customers could queue while remaining appropriately distanced from one another. The retailer reasonably noted it was chalk, would wash out, and was serving to enforce government guidelines to keep people safe. The officer rebutted with the fact there is a law against chalking pavements, and what would happen if we ignored laws like that at a time of crisis? Sadly for him even his own superiors were not impressed by that reasoning when the footage emerged, and no ticket for criminal damage was issued.
 There will always be problems with individuals when they are given new powers or a new rulebook. Some are fussy and pedantic, sticking to the letter of what is in front of them instead of its purpose.
 Some – very reasonably – will be confused by the complexity of the government guidance, and how it often goes further than, or even contradicts, what’s in the actual laws they have passed, though it is of course their job to know the letter of the law. And a small minority appear to simply enjoy enforcing rules and imposing power on others.
 That is sad enough at an individual level, but can quickly become disturbing when it rises to the level of becoming institutional. This seems to be happening with Derbyshire police, who first posted social media footage taken from a police drone of citizens doing such nefarious things as walking their dog, or stopping to take a photo while walking.
 The force’s reasoning in that instance was that these groups were breaking a law Derbyshire police seem to have imagined, against driving to exercise – which at the time wasn’t even against government advice.
 The force then compounded their weird behaviour by posting that they had dyed a natural beauty spot – an azure blue pond – black, to dissuade people from swimming in it, during the coronavirus crisis. Given the pool is actually alkaline run-off from an old quarry and dangerous to swim in, the force has actually been dyeing it for years, why pretend now it’s a quarantine measure?
 Most police forces aren’t behaving anything like Derbyshire – they understand the need for a calm approach, appealing to reason and to people’s better nature.
 We will need those types of officer to prevail if the UK is to sustain a lockdown that will save lives.
 One week shut in at home is almost a treat. It becomes something quite different as people are forced to live off either diminished earnings or none at all, with no social releases, cooped in with the same people, having to queue 40 minutes every time they need to go to the supermarket. The honeymoon phase of quarantine is rapidly coming to its end.
 Sustaining it beyond that needs a sense of shared purpose, that we’re doing this for each other, and that we’re all in it together. Fostering that has, in theory at least, been at the core of policing since its earliest days. Policing by consent has been codified in the UK’s system since at least 1829.
 Even back then, new constables were handed a set of nine principles, including that “the power of the police to fulfil their functions and duties is dependent on public approval of their existence, actions and behaviour and on their ability to secure and maintain public respect”.
 Police are never supposed to be our overlords – they are supposed to be citizens in uniform, representatives of the people, not of government.
 Trying to live up to this perhaps impossible standard is more important now than it has been for decades. If quarantine is something that feels imposed on us, first by diktat and then by force, it will fail – and coronavirus will surge.
 We all need to remember what, and who, we’re doing this for. Police should be helping to remind the public of that – not the other way around.

In a bid to help fight against the new coronavirus pandemic, Microsoft-owned professional networking platform LinkedIn on Thursday said it is offering free job postings, promoting urgent jobs and hiring resources to companies from industries in critical need.
 LinkedIn is offering companies and organisations in healthcare (including medical device, medical practice and mental health care), supermarket, warehousing and freight delivery, as well as disaster relief non-profit organisations the ability to post jobs for free on the platform — from April 1 to June to 30 — and hire people needed to fill these mission-critical roles.
 “We are hearing heroic stories of how those on the frontlines are working around the clock to protect the public. It’s clear, however, that more help is needed to fill the most urgent open roles,” Ruchee Anand, Director of Talent and Learning Solutions, India at LinkedIn said in a statement.
 “That is why we are bolstering our efforts to help accelerate the hiring of people with relevant skills that are most needed in India right now,” Anand added.
 According to the professional networking platform, the company is helping job seekers with the right skills to quickly find open roles by promoting them on our Jobs page.
 For instance, frontline healthcare roles, such as doctors and nurses, will be automatically added to a list of ‘urgent’ jobs, which will be surfaced to LinkedIn members with relevant skills.
 LinkedIn members that have relevant skills that fit these open roles will receive automatic real-time alerts and emails that inform them so that they can apply immediately.
 The company has also heard from its healthcare staffing customers that they need help hiring for critical healthcare roles.
 To help support their surge hiring needs, LinkedIn is offering access to ‘LinkedIn Talent Insight’s for three months to give our customers real-time data and insights to identify critical healthcare professionals efficiently.
 They have expanded its ‘Recruiting For Good’ programme to deploy its own team of recruiters to help source and screen talent for organisations on the front lines so that these organisations can fill urgent paid and volunteer positions.

The other major component of fish oil, DHA, is unhelpful and might even be bad for you. So Amarin removed DHA from fish oil, and created a purified version of EPA.

The American Medical Association has a long list of guidelines for how doctors can stay in business. None addresses what doctors do when they run out of money.

Aerogen® Solo vibrating mesh nebulizer (VMN) is a high performance, highly efficient aerosol drug delivery device.  Unlike traditional jet nebulizers, vibrating mesh nebulizers have been demonstrated to have significantly reduced fugitive emissions due to the combination of low or no airflow requirement. The use of the Aerogen® Ultra chamber, or even a T-piece with mouthpiece which can be used with a filter, greatly reduces fugitive aerosol emissions. In addition, the VMN product design prevents contaminated fluids from entering the medication reservoir both on and off the mechanical ventilator.  For more information, please go to www.aerogen.com.

"Le imprese associate VéGé, donando complessivamente 900.000 euro, intendono così agire in favore dei luoghi in cui operano. A titolo di esempio ricordiamo donazioni in favore degli ospedali di Treviso, di Licata, di Agrigento, di Polla, di Avellino, donazioni alle Asl della Campania. Parte dei contributi sarà devoluto alla rete ospedaliera delle province siciliane maggiormente colpite dall’epidemie, come l’ospedale Umberto I di Enna, Cervello di Palermo, Policlinico di Messina e le Aziende Ospedaliere Cannizzaro e Garibaldi di Catania, così come, in Sardegna, a 4 Comunità Sociali di Cagliari. A livello nazionale, invece, 600.000 euro saranno devoluti direttamente alla Croce Rossa Italiana che è in prima linea dall'inizio dell’allerta Covid-19 in modo capillare su tutto il territorio nazionale attraverso migliaia di volontari e operatori che stanno lavorando senza sosta per sostenere la popolazione. La CRI sta intervenendo con i suoi mezzi, le sue donne e i suoi uomini per garantire soccorso, supporto sanitario e logistico in questa emergenza e sta gestendo in sicurezza i trasporti sanitari dei casi potenzialmente sospetti con mezzi ad alto biocontenimento. Con il numero verde CRI PER LE PERSONE 800 – 065510 attivo h24 sta fornendo supporto psicologico e informazioni corrette a centinaia di migliaia di cittadini, oltre all’aiuto diretto a tutte le persone più vulnerabili e con maggior fragilità sociali e sanitarie, che hanno bisogno della spesa a domicilio, il trasporto sociale, la consegna dei farmaci e dei beni di prima necessità".

The swabs for Covid involved a deep back of throat cotton bud swipe; I gagged, but whatever. And a nasal swipe which made me cry out – the thing is thrust right up your nose and seemingly (as a doctor later put it) into your mind. Whatever. You know you’re up shit creek. A little discomfort is neither here nor there, but still, you wouldn’t want that again in a hurry.

RED WING -- The Big Turn Music Festival was launched in 2018. Before the third annual event Feb. 21-23, the planner took a rare break to attend Red Wing Area Chamber of Commerce’s annual business of the year awards... and they won the Red Wing Area Chamber of Commerce’s Arts & Entertainment, Lodging, Recreation & Tourism Business of the Year.
 Sam Brown is the creator of Big Turn. After working to co-create a festival in Oregon and then starting the Midwest Music Fest in Winona, Minnesota, Brown returned to his hometown to try and bring excitement to the dark and cold months .
 “It’s just a great way for us to showcase Red Wing in the winter and the unique things it has to offer,” said Chris Warrington, one of the Big Turn staff members
 The “music crawl,” as Brown describes it, brings in hundreds of bands and dozens of volunteers for the two-day event each year. And thousands of people
 As anyone who lives in Red Wing or has attended the festival knows, the Friday and Saturday of Big Turn are filled with musicians who pack into a variety of venues to share their tunes. People from near and far are attracted to the variety of talent.
 While this event is citywide, it begins in a small office space above Red Wing Corner Drug. There the team makes plans for the festival and coordinates which groups will participate and where they will perform, along with the numerous other details that need to be considered to ensure that the two day event goes smoothly.
 During the annual event, the offices are pushed to the maximum capacity with bands and solo artists checking in, volunteers picking-up various items, reporters claiming their press passes and Brown and other team members solving any day-of issues that arise.
 When planning the first Big Turn, Brown was very specific about which weekend would host the festival.
 “I wanted it to be a true winter event, not a pseudo winter event like the Midwest Music Fest,” Brown explained.
 The event was not held a week earlier because Brown did not want to impose on Valentine’s Day.
 “You can’t mess with Valentine’s Day,” he explained to the Republican Eagle.
 If it were the last weekend of February, it would be close to and possibly spill into March, creating more of an early spring festival than an authentically winter event. (And he couldn't have known three years ago, but also would have collided with the rise in the U.S. of the COVID-19 pandemic this year.)
 The ultimate goal for the festival is to help people have a good time. Brown explained, “The vision for the festival is to create an atmosphere of fun and creativity where everyone can be themselves and have an amazing time while doing so.”

With many states, counties, and cities issuing various stay-at-home orders, that run the gamut from mild to extremely strict, dealers have been left with few good options. They are living the pandemic nightmare, right alongside millions of small businesses. Many of those businesses won't survive. Some of our auto dealer clients might not survive this, but many will, because auto dealers are a resilient and a resourceful bunch of entrepreneurs.

Speaking to CNN, Pence said, "We think Italy may be the most comparable area to the United States at this point." Italy, which has already recorded more than 13,000 deaths, has issued a nationwide quarantine, shutting down almost all industrial production and offices and largely prohibiting residents from leaving their homes. The U.S. has recorded more than 5,000 deaths, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University.
