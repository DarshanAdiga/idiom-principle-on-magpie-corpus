Corrects to show loan amount $700 million, not $700 billion in headline and first paragraph)
 WASHINGTON, Dec 10 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Thursday he will recommend that his successor next year consider selling to a third party the $700 million emergency government loan made to trucking company YRC Worldwide at a profit to taxpayers.
 Mnuchin, speaking to a congressional oversight commission on federal coronavirus aid programs, said the loan to YRC, which hauls goods for the Defense Department, "was a risky loan."
 "We've been fortunate that the economy recovered, and that the equity is doing well and I am going to recommend that next year, whoever is Treasury secretary seriously look at selling this loan and recovering what I think will be a profit to taxpayers because this was a success," Mnuchin said.

The first COVID-19 vaccine doses will soon land in Santa Clara County, with 17,550 doses from Pfizer Inc. set to arrive Dec. 15 and 39,300 doses from Moderna Inc. later this month.
 The Pfizer doses will only be available to a small sliver of the population. Only those in the highest risk categories — a subset of health care workers and employees in long-term care facilities — will initially be eligible to receive the vaccine.
 Moderna Inc., the second drug manufacturer in the pipeline to receive a possible Food and Drug Administration emergency use authorization for its COVID-19 vaccine, plans to release 39,300 doses later this month to Santa Clara County, the county's Public Health Department announced on Wednesday night.
 The Moderna vaccine would be in addition to an anticipated 17,550 doses of vaccine the county would receive from manufacturer Pfizer Inc., totaling 56,850 for the county's first allotment. Two doses of the vaccine must be given weeks apart (21 days for the Pfizer vaccine and 28 days for the Moderna vaccine), meaning 28,425 people would receive the first round of vaccine doses.
 "While these initial allotments will not provide vaccinations for everyone in the priority groups, more doses of both vaccines are expected to become available in the coming weeks and months. The County is prepared to rapidly and equitably distribute all vaccine doses it receives according to a required vaccine plan submitted to the state earlier this month," the Public Health Department said in its statement.
 The department will help allocate the vaccine doses to hospitals in the county.
 Widespread vaccinations are an essential part of the county's plan for preventing the spread of COVID-19 and eventually lifting public health restrictions. At a county Health and Hospital Committee meeting Wednesday, Health Officer Dr. Sara Cody said very few people will be immunized at first, and that it will take at least a 70% immunization rate to reach herd immunity. Until then, the county won't be easing up on the countywide health order.
 "All the current prevention measures we are doing need to stay in place while this vaccine rolls out," Cody said.
 Per federal guidelines, the first round of vaccine doses must go to health care personnel, with the local allocation going to workers in acute care, psychiatric and correctional facility hospitals. Workers in long-term care facilities, including nursing homes and assisted living facilities, will also be eligible.
 Residents of long-term care facilities make up only 5% of the county's total COVID-19 cases, but account for 44% of the deaths. There are no visitors allowed at these facilities, meaning the virus is likely getting into these facilities through the workers, said Dr. Marty Fenstersheib, the county's COVID-19 testing officer.
 Other health care staff ranging from paramedics and EMTs to dialysis center workers are eligible to receive the vaccine, but there's simply not enough to go around, Cody said. The county has nearly 75,000 acute care hospital personnel, which greatly exceeds the first round of doses.
 "We hope if everything works out that by the end of the year, or soon into the next year, we will have all those acute care hospital employees vaccinated," Cody said.
 Pfizer's vaccine is the first in line to receive approval from the FDA through what's called emergency use authorization, which the federal agency is expected to grant on or soon after Thursday, Dec. 10. From there, California will receive 327,000 doses, of which 17,550 will be sent to Santa Clara County. The hope is that the vaccine will arrive in the county on Tuesday, Dec. 15 and be ready for distribution.
 Moderna is expected to receive approval on Dec. 17, with no clear date for when it could arrive in Santa Clara County, according to county health officials.
 Though Pfizer is the first in line, its vaccine is cumbersome to handle. It comes in 975-dose containers that cannot be split, which makes scaling down to small health clinics difficult, and requires "ultra" cold storage of below 70 degrees Celsius. Moderna's vaccine comes in orders of 100 doses, and only needs to be held at below 20 degrees Celsius.
 Fenstersheib said the county will be getting new rounds of vaccine doses on a weekly basis, with California slated to receive nearly 1 million vaccine doses between Dec. 21 and Dec. 27. The county allocations for that week's doses has yet to be determined, he said.
 County officials are taking a laser-like focus to vaccinating health care workers, but what about residents? As it stands right now, Cody said the federal government is making doses available to commercial pharmacies who are charged with vaccinating the residents of long-term care facilities, but the county has no details on how that would work.
 Earlier this month, county health officials filed a formal COVID-19 vaccine distribution plan to the state detailing how they would get doses out to the public. The plan designates the Santa Clara County Fairgrounds in San Jose and nine county-run health clinics as "points of distribution," making them critical locations for people to access both doses of the vaccine.
 At the Dec. 9 meeting, county Supervisor Joe Simitian hammered county officials for leaving out a huge chunk of Santa Clara County in the plan. His district, which encompasses 400,00 residents in North County and West Valley cities, has no county health clinics, which could force residents in the area to travel long distances to get the vaccine.
 Simitian said it's hard to believe that the county crafted the vaccine plan with two task forces, one composed of health care providers and another composed of community stakeholders, and neither named a single North County or West Valley location as a priority spot to distribute the vaccine.
 "How did we get to a Dec. 1 plan sent to the state that overlooked 400,000 people in the North County and West Valley in the fifth supervisorial district?" Simitian asked. "I really am thinking now — how is it everyone sat around a table and neglected to reference distribution to 400,000 people?"
 Cody said the language of the plan was inclusive, specifically referring to "other clinics serving low-income, high-risk populations in other parts of the county." Simitian pushed back, calling that a "patently inaccurate reading" of the plan. He said his district has tens of thousands of people on Medi-Cal, many of whom lack transportation, and that it's a stretch to think shuffling to and from San Jose twice is enough access.
 "The notion that they are going to get, not once, but twice, to a remote location on public transportation three weeks apart strains credulity," Simitian said.

 WASHINGTON/PALO ALTO, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Facebook Inc could be forced to sell its prized assets WhatsApp and Instagram after the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and nearly every U.S. state filed lawsuits against the social media company, saying it used a "buy or bury" strategy to snap up rivals and keep smaller competitors at bay.
 With the filing of the twin lawsuits on Wednesday, Facebook becomes the second big tech company to face a major legal challenge this year after the U.S. Justice Department sued Alphabet Inc's Google in October, accusing the $1 trillion company of using its market power to fend off rivals.
 The lawsuits highlight the growing bipartisan consensus to hold Big Tech accountable for its business practices and mark a rare moment of agreement between the Trump administration and Democrats, some of whom have advocated breaking up both Google and Facebook.
 The complaints on Wednesday accuse Facebook of buying up rivals, focusing specifically on its previous acquisitions of photo-sharing app Instagram for $1 billion in 2012 and messaging app WhatsApp for $19 billion in 2014.
 Federal and state regulators said the acquisitions should be unwound - a move that is likely to set off a long legal challenge as the deals were cleared years earlier by the FTC.
 "For nearly a decade, Facebook has used its dominance and monopoly power to crush smaller rivals, snuff out competition, all at the expense of everyday users," said New York Attorney General Letitia James on behalf of the coalition of 46 states, Washington, D.C. and Guam. Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina and South Dakota did not participate in the lawsuit.
 James said the company acquired rivals before they could threaten the company's dominance.
 Facebook's general counsel Jennifer Newstead called the lawsuits "revisionist history" and said antitrust laws do not exist to punish "successful companies." She said WhatsApp and Instagram have succeeded after Facebook invested billions of dollars in growing the apps.
 "The government now wants a do-over, sending a chilling warning to American business that no sale is ever final," Newstead said.
 Newstead also raised doubts about alleged harms caused by Facebook, arguing that consumers benefited from its decision to make WhatsApp free, and rivals like YouTube, Twitter and WeChat did "just fine" without access to its developer platform.
 In a post on Facebook's internal discussion platform, Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told employees he did not anticipate "any impact on individual teams or roles" as a result of the lawsuits, which he said were "one step in a process which could take years to play out in its entirety."
 Comments were turned off for Zuckerberg's post, as well as for other posts on the lawsuits shared by Newstead and Chief Privacy Officer for Product Michel Protti, according to copies viewed by Reuters. Newstead also warned employees not to post about the cases.
 Facebook did not immediately respond to questions about the posts.
 PROTRACTED FIGHT
 Zuckerberg told employees in July 2019 that Facebook would "go to the mat" to fight a legal challenge to break up the company, calling it an "existential" threat, according to audio of internal company meetings published by The Verge.
 Although breakup remedies are rare, some antitrust experts said the case was unusually strong given damning statements by Zuckerberg plucked from Facebook's own documents, like a 2008 email in which he said "it is better to buy than compete."
 Other experts such as Seth Bloom of Bloom Strategic Counsel said the FTC complaint was "significantly weaker" than the DOJ's lawsuit against Google.
 "We're talking about acquisitions that are six or eight years old and it will be difficult for a court to order divestitures of many years ago," Bloom said.
 Investors echoed similar concerns.
 "I do not know if the FTC or DOJ will be successful in breaking Facebook up. I'm assuming this will be dragged out in the courts as FB defends itself," said Daniel Morgan, a portfolio manager at Synovus Trust in Atlanta, Georgia.
 The lawsuits are the biggest antitrust cases in a generation, comparable to the lawsuit against Microsoft Corp in 1998. The federal government eventually settled that case, but the yearslong court fight and extended scrutiny prevented the company from thwarting competitors and is credited with clearing the way for the explosive growth of the internet.
 Last month, Facebook said it was buying customer service start-up Kustomer, in an acquisition that the Wall Street Journal said valued Kustomer at $1 billion.
 Facebook also bought Giphy, a popular website for making and sharing animated images, or GIFs, in May. That acquisition has already drawn scrutiny from the United Kingdom's competition watchdog.
 Facebook shares fell as much as 3% after the news before paring losses to close down 1.9%.

Epstein argued that western countries have been equally at fault when it comes to the rule of law, but have come under less scrutiny from EU institutions than Hungary or Poland. “Brexit was not framed as a violation of the rule of law, but the decision was predicated on mass misinformation,” she said, highlighting the racist tropes used to try to mobilise the vote to leave. “The policy toolkit with respect to immigration is not just East European; we see it across the board. This set of attitudes was mobilised and elevated in US, Brazil and India, far beyond the European sphere. The salience of identity politics seems to have a renewed power and has become a source of mobilising political action.”
