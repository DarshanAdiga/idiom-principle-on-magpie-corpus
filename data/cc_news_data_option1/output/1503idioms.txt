No, that we did some hiring, but we've also got automation coming in. We would expect those costs to go down substantially, almost any way forgetting about cutting costs because of the COVID thing. We're in a position where we staff up expecting a big growth year and then of course this isn't going to happen. So we've got some issues to work through. Plus we’ve put in some new technology that'll take root over the next probably quarter or two. That'll allow us to really keep the overheads down as we grow, assuming we get to grow. So we're a little bit in a tough spot because we expected 2020 to be very good growth year and we were set up for it and we thought the technology would actually help that make it easier. The fact that we're looking at what we're doing now, we're going to have to look at that depending on how long this lasts and whether we get some real benefits within the industry from what happens.

Well, we're edging in pricing to see. I think once we get a handle on what the volume levels will be, again -- and obviously if we want them to go lower, we can raise the price a little bit and see whether we get the business with the price or whether it goes away. So, remember that, the easiest way to look at this sort of issue is March was great, all the way through the end of March, we either had enough inventory or enough volumes and we couldn't even tell anything was going on. So, now we're two weeks into sort of the new world and it's just too early to tell. But on the one hand maybe we’ll get some more volume from other folks not playing. Maybe we could get that volume with a price increase. It's that we’re just two weeks in, we just don't know yet. All we know right now is volumes have slowed significantly in the first two weeks, which is exactly what we expected. Whether they stay that way, they go down further, they pick up, we just don't know yet.

Leicester headed to Selhurst Park on the back of an incredible 5-3 victory over Manchester United last Sunday.
 However, last season's second-tier champions were undone by second-half goals from Fraizer Campbell and Mile Jedinak against Neil Warnock's side.
 Leicester arguably edged the early stages and could have gone ahead in the 13th minute when Jamie Vardy saw a shot from inside the area saved by Julian Speroni.
 A dogged Palace defence kept Leicester at bay, though, and manager Pearson believes his team must take their chances when they come.
 "No doubt in the first half we looked pretty comfortable. It was about half an hour before they had a serious threat on our goal," he said.
 "In the second half we didn't have enough control. It illustrates we have to take the chances when they come along. We had good opportunities but couldn't convert them and sometimes you pay the price for that.
 "We didn't take the chances that came along and you have to give Palace a lot of credit, they defended their goal with numbers and the match didn't go our way."
 Both of Palace's goals came from set-pieces and Pearson rued the number of soft fouls conceded by his team.
 "We didn't defend the set-plays as well as we have done in previous games," he added. "The quality of the delivery was pretty good, they have some big players and we didn't quite deal with it.
 "There will be individual errors but for the most part what you have to do against sides who put high emphasis on set-plays is not give them away.
 "I thought at times we were guilty of giving away a couple of cheap ones, we could have taken pressure off ourselves by not giving them away."
 Leicester remain in the top half and face fellow top-flight newcomers Burnley next Saturday.

So, first off, the quarter was great. We actually had a very good quarter, certainly the end of the quarter got interesting. But we'll go through the specifics of the quarter, but we were very pleased with how everything worked. Originations has functioned great, collections is great. So generally it was a tax season. So, you would expect the first quarter to be good as much as the COVID problem started sort of halfway through March, it really didn't have an effect on the first quarter, which is why the numbers were good and we had good results in terms of the operations.

Periods of adversity have been a hallmark of human existence. Wars, natural disasters, and past pandemics have shown that our lifetimes are rarely without challenge.
 Yet it is in those challenges that we define our humanity. Such is the case with the COVID-19 pandemic. With so many unpredictable variables, these uncharted waters are being navigated literally hour by hour. A true damned if you do and damned if you don’t scenario for our leaders.
 How do we respond to this threat? At present, we are trying to mitigate the effects of this contagion on billions of people while at the same time trying to prevent a self-induced global economic collapse. In the United States, we have partially shuttered the greatest economy in the world.
 In Congress, we have now passed three specific pieces of legislation purposed to fight the effects of COVID-19 on this nation, the last of which, the $2 trillion Coronavirus Aid Relief and Economic Security, or CARES, Act, was meant to stabilize the economy while we ride out this crisis.
 The CARES Act is not a stimulus package but rather a stabilization measure designed to keep businesses financially viable so that, when we do get through this crisis, and we will, we have an intact structure to restart the economy.
 This leaves the most difficult questions. At what point do we take our foot off the brake and let the economy come back? What does the other side of the curve look like? Poverty, as a social determinant, is known to be a leading cause of death.
 Many are not seeking routine medical care they should be. As we push in one side of the balloon, the other side bulges, which may lead to an increase in deaths due to untreated mental health disorders, nascent cancers, and heart disease.
 We have now worked to flatten the curve not only to save lives but also to buy time for our hospitals to gather resources. So, what should the future look like?

“My shtick is I send Penelope emails, usually very late at night when I’ve gone down a rabbit hole, and they have one word with an exclamation point,” says Becker. “I started with, like, ‘Caught on Tape!’ (a series of surveillance paranoia, like Francis Ford Coppola’s “The Conversation”) or ‘Heist movies!’”
 Becker declined to share subscriber numbers for the Criterion Channel, which is available in the U.S. and Canada. But he said he couldn’t be more pleased with its growth, and he’s happy for it to occupy a humble space amid much larger streaming-service battles. When WarnerMedia, which is preparing the launch of HBO Max, canceled Filmstruck, the company deemed it “a niche service.”
 “We are still very niche. Being niche is not something that huge corporations necessarily want to be,” says Becker. “But we wear it as a badge of honor in certain way. We’re sticking with what we believe in.”
 For Becker, the Criterion Channel also works in tandem with movie theaters. Movies are meant to be seen on the big screen, he insists — an unusual perspective for a DVD and streaming company. But it’s that passionate affection for cinema that makes Criterion what it is.
 Like Filmstruck did, the Channel features documentary portraits of arthouse theaters nationwide. Support of them is essential during the pandemic, Becker says, which is why the Criterion Collection helped launch a crowd-sourced relief fund for arthouse theaters. In two weeks, it’s raised nearly $400,000.
 Bartlett says the Channel is weighing other measures, possibly hosting films that had their festival premieres canceled or the planned series of shuttered arthouses. It's one more way that Criterion is fulfilling its role as a lifeblood for the movie lover.
 “The whole point of being a good curator is to suggest some stuff that may light up some of your audience and infuriate other parts of your audience,” says Becker. “You have to risk failure to qualify for discovery. So we’re trying to encourage people to be bold and exploratory.”
 The ideas keep coming. The other night, Becker, contemplating the trials of the housebound, sent Bartlett another one-word email. Its headline: “Roommates!
