NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has instructed the 32 teams to close their facilities to all but a select few employees by 6 p.m. Wednesday.
 In a memo to the teams, Goodell said the restrictions meant as a safeguard against the new coronavirus will be in force until at least April 8, when the league will re-evaluate, using advice from medical experts and health authorities.
 Goodell told the teams only the following employees can be at team facilities for the next two weeks:
 • Trainers or doctors who are providing ongoing medical treatment to players.
 • Directors of facilities, security personnel and independent contracts who maintain physical security of the facilities.
 • Technology personnel necessary to maintain security and operational capabilities of a team’s IT network that enables remote work by team staff.
 “During this time,” Goodell wrote, “clubs are free to conduct all normal business operations, including signing players, evaluating draft-eligible prospects, selling tickets and other activities to prepare for the 2020 season.”
 Chiefs ink Pennel, Sherman — The Kansas City Chiefs have agreed to one-year deals with defensive tackle Mike Pennel and full-back Anthony Sherman, continuing their trend of keeping low-cost valuable contributors to their Super Bowl run on the roster.
 The cash-strapped Chiefs have been relatively quiet in free agency, though they have retained several of their own. That includes franchising defensive tackle Chris Jones and signing backup quarterback Chad Henne on a two-year deal.
 Vikings add Sharpe, Zettel — The Minnesota Vikings agreed to contract terms with wide receiver Tajaé Sharpe and defensive end Anthony Zettel, adding two fifth-year veterans at positions vacated by star players.
 Sharpe played his first four NFL seasons for Tennessee, a fifth-round draft pick in 2016 out of Massachusetts. Zettel was a sixth-round draft choice by Detroit in 2016 out of Penn State. He has since been with Cleveland, Cincinnati and San Francisco.

The IOC had income of $5.7 billion for the last four-year Olympic cycle (2013-2016). Almost three-quarters of the income is from selling broadcasting rights, with another 18 percent from sponsors.


  The IOC also has a reserve fund of about $2 billion, and insurance to cover losses.


  Bent Flyvbjerg, an author of “The Oxford Olympics Study 2016: Cost and Cost Overrun at the Games,” in an email to the Associated Press, said the IOC should share more of the costs and termed it a “monopoly.”


  The study found the Olympics have the “highest average cost overrun of any type of mega-project.”


  Flyvbjerg said the IOC should “pick up a larger part of the bill for the games, which the IOC profits from.


  “Tokyo and Japan will pick up the added cost, unless the IOC makes an exception and expands the reserve fund, which is what the IOC should do from an ethics point of view.”


  Tokyo was planning to use 42 venues for 33 sports. One extra venue was planned for the Paralympics.


  Muto said it was not clear how many venues would be available a year from now.


  “Some venues we might have to keep renting until next year,” he said, “because at some venues it takes about a year to get them ready. We can’t take them down and then set them up again for the Olympics. That also means added costs.”


  The biggest headache could be the Athletes Village, which is to house 11,000 Olympians and staff, and 4,400 Paralympians and staff.


  The sprawling site on Tokyo Bay, 5,632 apartments, is to be sold off after the Olympics and reports say one-quarter have already been sold.


  Some cost more than $1 million.


  One of the developers, Mitsui Fudosan Co., said it has suspended sales at the complex, which will include 23 buildings.


  Even lining up 80,000 unpaid volunteers again could be expensive and create more work.


  The city of Tokyo was also planning to use 30,000 added volunteers to help fans find train lines or street addresses, and dish out general help for non- Japanese speakers.


  Ticket demand has also been unprecedented with 7.8 million available, and demand exceeding supply by 10 times. Ticket sales are expected to raise about $1 billion for local organizers.


  All tickets have a force majeure clause, which might get organizers off the hook of paying refunds if the coronavirus is deemed to be “beyond Tokyo 2020’s reasonable control.”


  “We don’t have a final conclusion about what our policy will be,” Muto said. “As much as possible, we want to make sure that people who have already bought tickets will get special consideration.”

  Salina


  John Schmidt, went to be with the Lord on March 23, 2020 after a long battle with Multiple Myeloma and ultimately complications from pneumonia.


  John was an adoring husband and devoted father. He loved the outdoors and shared his passion for hunting with his children, grandchildren, family and friends. He could often be heard singing to his favorite Doo-Wop tune or performing in a barbershop quartet. John had a quiet disposition but was a pillar of strength and his presence was larger than life. There's not a dessert he didn't love and was a lifelong Bronco fan. He travelled the world as an avid hunter but also enjoyed the relaxation of a beach vacation. John, a true gentleman and man of character and wisdom, was an incredible example to all who knew him.


  John lived in Salina, Kansas and is survived by his wife, Betty Tallman Schmidt, his son and daughter-in-law Willi & Sherry Schmidt, 3 step-children and their spouses Tracy & Dave Newman, Lisa & Mike Foley, Amie & Stephen Gulick, 13 grandchildren, 5 siblings, nieces and nephews, great nieces and nephews and his previous wife, Tschudy Griffith Schmidt. He was predeceased by his daughter Katherine Schmidt.


  John was born on September 19, 1943 to Clarence & Nora Schmidt. He grew up in McPherson, Kansas on the family's Hilltop Turkey Farm. After graduating from McPherson High School in 1961 he received his undergraduate degree at Ottawa University and his doctorate degree in wildlife biology from Colorado State University. John spent 40 years of his career in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado and Montana and the plains of Kansas. He was a faculty member at Colorado State University and later worked to connect people \"interested in supporting a cause\" for Ducks Unlimited, RMEF and then with the Land Institute from which he retired. A novice author, John was in the process of writing a book about the hunting club he proudly founded along the Platte River in Colorado - Drakeland Farms.


  A strong supporter of its mission, John served as a member of Rotary International for more than 40 years and was the President of the Salina Noon Rotary Club. In addition, throughout his lifetime, John was involved in many other philanthropic conservation endeavors.


  John loved our Lord Jesus Christ, bringing comfort to his loved ones in knowing that he is in God's everlasting kingdom. John was the love of Betty's life and a precious gift and he will remain in her heart forever. He was loved and adored by so many and will be greatly missed by all who knew him. John's family will celebrate his life at a later date. In place of flowers, donations can be made in his honor to the Land Institute https://landinstitute.org. 2440 E. Water Well Rd. Salina, KS 67401. For more information or to leave condolences go to www.ryanmortuary.com

 ## Relief measures
 At this challenging and uncertain time, she said it was imperative for each one of us to rise above partisan interests and honour our duty towards our country and indeed, towards humanity.
 “It is in the spirit of solidarity and cooperation therefore, that I would like to suggest some measures that I believe will help us address the massive health crisis we are about to face and to ameliorate the immense economic and existential pain that vulnerable sections of our society will soon be subjected to,” the Congress chief said.
 She stressed on the need to arm doctors, nurses and health workers with personal protection equipment, including N-95 masks and hazmat suits.
 “Let us ensure the opening and scaling up of manufacture and supply of these items so that not a single health professional faces the predicament of contracting or passing on COVID-19 owing to unavailability of ‘Personal Protection Equipment’,” Gandhi said.
 Announcing a special “Risk Allowance” for doctors, nurses and health workers for a period of six months retrospectively from March 1 was imperative, she added.
 Noting that many businesses and companies were laying off and retrenching large numbers of regular and temporary employees, Gandhi said, “It would be in order for the Union Government to immediately put in place broad-based social protection measures, including direct cash transfer, to these sections to tide over the period of difficulty.”
 She also sought a deferment of all loan recoveries up to six months, including those for farmers and the salaried class.

 Commissioners considered reopening county beaches but ultimately did not do so.
 Last Friday, the commission voted to close the county’s beached through April 13 to encourage tourists to leave in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 During a discussion of restricting county parks, commission Chairman Mike Browning suggested opening the beaches for residents.
 Commissioner Peter Murphy supported Browning, saying the commission should open the beaches for a limited period in the mornings and evenings.
 Several commissioners opposed the move.
 “If it’s overkill, so be it ... At least we can say we did what we possibly could to keep this virus away from healthy people,” said commissioner Bob Coleman.
 He said it was time to “draw a line in the sand” and take a strong stance by keeping the beaches closed.
 “What we’re trying to find is a balance between the draconian shelter-in-place (orders imposed on other cities) and an absence of restrictions,” Murphy said. “‘Let’s not overdo it right now would be my only message.”
 Commissioners David O’Quinn and Allen Booker were against reopening anything and possibly adding more establishments to the list of closures, such as picnic areas and golf courses.
 “If we do too little people will die and people will suffer, but if we do too much we’ll just get criticized for doing too much,” O’Quinn said.
 Booker said opening even for limited hours would attract people from all over, not just locals but residents from surrounding counties as well.
 Commissioner Bill Brunson voiced concerns about unnecessarily exposing law enforcement officers to possibly infected persons in the process of opening or closing the beaches.
 O’Quinn referenced a letter from the Southeast Georgia Health System encouraging the county to impose more strict restrictions on public activity.
 “We’ve got a letter from the hospital telling us to move forward and not move back,” O’Quinn said.
 O’Quinn also threw out some numbers he received from an individual who claimed to have researched rates of infection and death in other areas of the country.
 “Of the 85,000 (people) we may have in our community, if we look at no social distancing, 65 percent of (county residents could contract the illness), 55,000 (could be) infected. Of those, 20 percent, about 11,000 showing severe symptoms. Of that, 2,700 would need medical care,” O’Quinn said. “We don’t have the healthcare infrastructure for those kinds of numbers.”
 Murphy and Browning continued to make their case. Browning saw it as away to prevent too many people from gathering elsewhere. He didn’t believe opening the beach for a few hours a day would attract many out-of-towners.
 They were unable to convince a majority of commissioners, however.

All England Lawn Tennis & Croquet Club (AELTC) has said that it is continuing a detailed evaluation of all scenarios, including postponement and cancellation of the Wimbledon due to the coronavirus pandemic and has called for an 'emergency meeting'. The meeting is scheduled for next week and AELTC said they are working closely with the UK government and public health authorities.


  "The AELTC has been contingency planning since January, working closely with the UK government and public health authorities to follow their advice and understand the likely impact of COVID-19 and the government's emergency measures on The Championships, and our thoughts are with all those affected by this crisis at this time," Wimbledon said in a statement. "An emergency meeting of the AELTC Main Board is scheduled for next week, and in preparation we are communicating closely with the LTA, and with the ATP, WTA, ITF and the other Grand Slams. The build for The Championships is due to begin at the end of April," the statement added.


  It further stated that playing behind closed doors has been 'formally ruled out'. "At this time, based on the advice we have received from the public health authorities, the very short window available to us to stage The Championships due to the nature of our surface suggests that postponement is not without significant risk and difficulty. Playing behind closed doors has been formally ruled out," the statement read.


  Commenting on the current situation, AELTC Chief Executive, Richard Lewis CBE, said: "The unprecedented challenge presented by the COVID-19 crisis continues to affect our way of life in ways that we could not have imagined, and our thoughts are with all those affected in the UK and around the world. The single most important consideration is one of public health, and we are determined to act responsibly through the decisions we make.

“Think about all the sports you would be competing against at that time of year,” Michael Phelps, who retired after 2016’s Rio Games as the most decorated athlete in Olympic history, said. “You have these gung-ho Olympic fans who want to watch the Games in the summer.


  “What if ratings plummet because of a change they make?”


  A spring Olympics would compete for U.S. television viewers against not only baseball, which would have just opened its season, but the NHL and NBA playoffs. Also, many major domestic soccer leagues around the world would be in the homestretch of their seasons.


  The sport that would be hurt the most by a spring Olympics is basketball.


  Most NBA players would not be able to compete (except, perhaps, those whose teams didn’t make the playoffs) and it would be a short turnaround from March Madness for many of the top men’s and women’s college players.


  When taking the athletes needs into consideration — which, of course, should be the primary goal though it rarely is — Phelps believes the Games should be rescheduled for the summer of 2021.


  “I think that’s best way to do it,” he said. “Then the athletes actually have a full year to go back to the drawing board, figure out what they have to do between now and the trials.


  “If you try to do it sooner, you’re almost lost in limbo.”


  Rick Burton, a professor of sports management at Syracuse University, wonders if the Olympics could even be staged safely next spring.


  “It would be impressive to kind of shoehorn something as big as the Olympics into March or April and not have it throw off the global calendars of the 33 sport federations,” Burton said.


  “It’s certainly a roll of the dice to believe that people may be able to attend sporting events a year from now, and that the athletes are going to be comfortable with one another in sports where there’s physical contact.”


  Tour de France champion Vincenzo Nibali, expected to be one of the favorites in Tokyo’s cycling road race, said he’ll be prepared for the rescheduled Olympics, no matter when that might be.


  “The postponement of a year does not change my aspirations,” the Italian rider said. “From now on, I can say that I will plan my preparation to arrive at the event in the best condition possible.”


  Kudos again to the IOC for making the prudent call to postpone the Games.


  Now comes the really difficult decision.


  “I’ll be ready for whatever date they name,” Murphy said. “I really just hope the games can move forward like we’ve always known it to be.”

Even before I looked in the mirror, I knew my face was puffy. It might have had something to do with the fact that I could feel my cheeks touching my eyebrows or maybe that my lips felt like they were the size of eggplants. I knew some women paid good money for lips that looked like mine, but at that moment, I suspected it was probably not a good look for me.      When I finally did take a peak in the mirror, I realized it wasn't just regular old, "I probably slept on my face" puffy. It was more like, "I look like the Pillsbury Doughboy" puffy. It was clear, something dramatic had happened while I slept. It was like the Tooth Fairy had taken out a hit on me.      "What happened to your face?" said my husband when I emerged from the bathroom.      "What do you mean?" I said, feigning ignorance.      "You're all, um, puffy."      "Oh?" I said. "I hadn't noticed."      "Really?" he said.      "OF COURSE NOT," I boomed. "How could I not notice that I woke up looking like a popover?"      He backed up slowly out of the bedroom, realizing this was one land mine he did not want to step on.      "Call the doctor," he shouted from the other room.      I should mention that this wasn't the first time I've had a puffy face. I experienced something similar years ago when I had my kids. When most women get pregnant, their feet swell. For me, it was my face. Of course, this may have had more to do with all the donuts I ate while I was pregnant than the pregnancy itself, but for arguments sake we'll just say it was pregnancy.      However, I was not pregnant now, and unless, by some miracle of middle age magic, wouldn't ever be again, so it clearly wasn't a hormonal thing. I also didn't recall eating anything the day before that I might have had a reaction to, such as blowfish poison, which could leave you looking like an actual blowfish, assuming you didn't die first.      Realizing I couldn't figure this out myself, I scheduled a televisit with my doctor.      "Your face is very puffy," my doctor said to me when she came on screen.      "See, that's why I chose you as my doctor," I said. "Because of your keen observational skills and masterful assessments."      "It's my superpower," she said. "So, what did you eat last night?"      "Nothing out of the ordinary."      "New cosmetics?" she said.      "Nope."      "Well, I'd say it definitely looks like an allergic reaction." She stared at my face in silence for a few moments.      "What did you wear yesterday?" she said.      "Um, a new wool sweater. A Turtleneck."   "Is your neck itchy?"      "Yes, actually, it is." I said. I had been so busy fretting about my puffy face that I hadn't noticed my itchy neck.      "You had an allergic reaction to the wool," she concluded.      "Wow. Okay," I said, recalling how uncomfortable I'd been at the end of the day. "So, that's something new. Are you sure?"      "Did you snore last night?" she asked.      "Actually, I did."      "Well, that's that," she said. "You either had a reaction to the sweater or your husband tried to smother you with a pillow."

Roy Cooper announced on Wednesday that a person from Cabarrus County died Tuesday and another person from Virginia who was traveling through the state also died from COVID-19 complications. More local governments issued stay-at-home orders for residents on Wednesday. North Carolina has gradually reduced allowable gathering sizes and ordered some nonessential businesses to close.

He said he and his son had returned recently from a long-planned trip but didn't say where they went. Folwell is a Repubilcan who was elected treasurer in 2016 and is seeking reelection this fall.

The Rev. Darius L. Swann was 95. Swann's wife, Vera, said her husband died on March 8 of pneumonia. His lawsuit filed against the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education in 1965, stemmed from his efforts to enroll his son in a predominantly white school closer to their home instead of a predominantly African American school further away. In 1971, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld court-ordered busing in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg school district, clearing the way for the use of busing as a means of desegregation.BODY FOUND- TRACTORMan found dead in tractor at North Carolina recycling siteHIGH POINT, N.C.

Event organizers announced Wednesday that the Menuhin Competition originally scheduled for mid- May in Richmond, Virginia, would instead be held in May 2021. The event is known as the “Olympics of the Violin." It was founded in 1983 by violinist Yehudi Menuhin, one of the great musical talents of the 20th century.

A company spokeswoman says all of its stores should have the barriers installed within the next two weeks. Publix has joined its competitors Kroger and Walmart in installing the so-called “sneeze guards.” Grocery stores are seeing their business soar as authorities urge people only to go out for essentials, prompting them to stay inside and cook more at home. Publix has more than 1,200 locations spread across Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia.BODY FOUND-SUSPECT SHOTSheriff's office links chase, shooting to body found at homeCLEMMONS, N.C.

The Winston- Salem Journal reports that the Forsyth County Sheriff's Office said a body was found at the home of 46-year-old Toni Renee Handy, who had been reported missing just after midnight Tuesday by Winston-Salem police. In the afternoon, a sheriff's deputy spotted Handy's pickup truck, which had been reported stolen. Authorities say 45-year-old Christopher Joel Mock drove the pickup truck through a shopping center parking lot and crashed into another truck before he was shot.BLUE RIDGE PARKWAY-SECTION CLOSED14 miles of Blue Ridge Parkway closed in North CarolinaRALEIGH, N.C.

Officials said they would continue to monitor conditions in the region. The announcement comes as popular national parks across the country, including Great Smoky Mountains, closed their gates Tuesday as visitors continued to flock to the sites.

  for the Daily Ledger


  One of the most memorable lines in the play "Our Town" comes when one of the characters describes the village's attitude toward charity.


  "We help those who can't help themselves, and those who can, we leave alone."


  It's a bedrock American feeling. Welfare is good for those who really need it, but only just enough to help them get by, and many people who get welfare don't really need it. They just want to take advantage of the system and get as much as they want without having to do anything. And instead of being grateful, these welfare cheats only demand more and more, trying to guilt trip hard-working Americans about their terrible situation without trying to do anything themselves to improve it.


  Yes, there are some people who scam the system, but studies have shown the main recipients of welfare are the disabled, the elderly and, especially, children.


  That's awful, we respond, but why aren't their parents taking care of them instead of just having more. And doesn't starting them out so young make them dependent on the system.


  We talk a lot about helping the deserving poor. But who decides who is deserving?


  While no one every talks about it, that is one of the big questions hanging over the parable of the Good Samaritan (Luke 10:30-37). We find it horrible that the two religious leaders simply passed the injured man without offering any help.


  But what if we were the ones who were walking on the road? What would we have done?


  I remember a friend of mine who told the story about growing up in Chicago and being attacked by a gang when he was a teenager. The attack was done on a busy, street in broad daylight in full view of hundreds of other people. Not one person helped him, either during the attack or after. Were they afraid they would be hurt? Were they feeling they didn't want to be inconvenienced? Did they feel he probably deserved the attack?


  And what about the Samaritan himself? If the story were being told today, the Samaritan would be an illegal immigrant or a hijab covered Muslim woman. What would we say about that person if we saw them helping the injured man to a hospital.


  Probably something like, I wonder if they picked his pockets before they brought him in. Maybe they were really in cahoots with the people who mugged the man, or possibly he or she was the one who did it. Maybe it's just another Jussie Smollett case, with the victim staging the "attack" to get more attention.


  But after over 60 years of hearing that story told in one form or another, I can honestly say I don't recall any sermon or message given from the point of view of the victim.


  What was he thinking or feeling? How did he see the situation? What were his feelings about the ones who attacked him, the ones who refused to help him or the Samaritan himself?


  As far as the attackers, his feelings were probably much like our own. Just another case of criminals who don't fear the law. They are coddled by the courts and take advantage of every loophole. They do what they want and never suffer any consequences. Maybe they are poor, but they are using that as an excuse to commit criminal activities without trying to really work and be good citizens and good people.


  And as far as the two religious leaders who passed him by? Well, it's like I've always said. Those religious people are hypocrites. They talk about justice and mercy but, boy, when push comes to shove, they don't really mean it. That's why I don't go to church.


  Sadly, though, many of us would have made excuses for them. Jewish laws at the time were very strict as to who religious people could come in contact with and what they were allowed to do. What if the victim were an unclean, unholy person? And they could have seen the victim as asking for what he got. After all, the road between Jericho and Jerusalem was known to be dangerous. What was he doing on that road, anyway?


  Of course if you asked them why they were on that road, they would have said it was none of our business. It's my right.


  Sadly, many of us would probably still fawn over the two religious leaders, even thanking them for what they did. A lot of people vote for politicians who actively work against their interests because they don't like the other guy (or gal). And, often, they identify with the politician harming them because they blame "those other guys" for the problems facing the voters.


  Studies have shown people will accept being put down by another person as long as they have someone to lord it over themselves. That's why many poor white southerners during the Civil War supported slavery, even when they didn't own slaves themselves and were actually hurt economically by that "peculiar institution," because they were able to look down on black people.


  And what did the victim think about the Samaritan?


  Often people who are helped don't feel any gratitude to the one who helped them. Part of it is embarrassment for needing help in the first place. Part of it is the condescending nature of many of those who help the less fortunate (in other words, people who are not as good as I am).


  But what if the victim was one of those people who didn't like Samaritans in the first place? Would he have used the situation to reevaluate his feelings about the people who he previously despised? Or would he have felt violated even more because the person helping was "beneath" him?


  When it comes down to it, the victim in the story is really us, even though we like to identify ourselves with the Samaritan. We are the ones who are in need and God is the One Who helps us in the crisis. But how does that makes us feel about God?


  "Well, if He really loved us we wouldn't be in this situation."


  God wasn't the one Who made us walk that road between Jericho and Jerusalem. God wasn't the one Who forced us into those sins of which we are guilty. God wasn't the one who directed the robbers to attack us.


  And don't we demand our individuality our freedom be respected? God did not make us robots.


  "I thought God was in charge of everything. If He allowed it to happen to me even though he could have prevented it then He is responsible."


  We live in a fallen world because we caused it to fall. It's not that sometime in the past some stupid man and woman ate an apple. It's because we demand our own way even when it isn't good for us. Sometimes we demand our own way because we know it isn't good for us.


  God doesn't have to make us sin. We are perfectly (or imperfectly) capable of doing that on our own.


  "Well, that Samaritan (illegal immigrant, Muslim, right-winger, abortionist) was different from all the rest of them. But one good apple doesn't mean the entire basket is wholesome. And maybe he was doing it to show off."


  Of course when we do something good, it's because we don't have any ulterior motives. That's the difference between "us" and "them."


  When you get right down to it, the person in the story who is most like us is the victim. We need help, we deserve help and we want it with no strings attached. Of course, when we are asked for help we have to make sure it is a deserving person who gets it.


  What does anyone do to merit God's Grace? Nothing. It wouldn't be Grace if it came with a price tag. And it wouldn't be Grace if we deserved it.


  Which means God is the Samaritan.


  Think about it.

Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal on Thursday said that all shops selling essential commodities in Delhi will be allowed to remain open round the clock to prevent crowding and rush by the people. He further added that the police department has been asked to allow e-commerce companies to function in the state.


  "Online service providers and e-retailers delivering essential services and goods to be allowed. All essential services shops can remain open 24 hours so that there is no rush of people," Baijal said at a press conference which was also attended by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal. He further added that the police department has finalised a list of e-commerce companies which will be allowed to function in the national capital.


  Briefing the media, Kejriwal said that Delhi till date has 36 confirmed cases of coronavirus. "Out of these, 26 are people who had come from foreign countries and the rest 10 people got infected from them. Therefore, the situation is currently under control and disease is not spreading amongst the people. We, however, do not need to sit back but to take more measures to stop its spread," Kejriwal said.


  The Delhi CM further urged all the people to stay indoors and not venture outside their homes unless it was for essential services. "People have mostly stayed in the last couple of days but some are still getting out. I urge all people to stay indoors unless it is for getting essential commodities like milk, vegetables or fruits," he said.


  He said that the government will provide passes to ration shops, medicine shops, vegetable vendors and other essential service providers via WhatsApp. "We are providing E-passes to all those involved in essential services. All you need to do is to call on 1031, following which the directions for getting the pass will be conveyed. The passes will be sent to them via WhatsApp," Kejriwal said.


  He further said that all police personnel have been urged that vendors selling milk, vegetables etc should be allowed to carry on their activities even if they do not have passes. He further said that Mohalla clinics in Delhi will not be closed and all precautions will be taken at the respective locations and said that regular testing of healthcare workers will now take place in the national capital.

ARLINGTON, Texas — There will be no hot dogs on the grill, no beer on tap, no vendors in the stands selling peanuts and Cracker Jack.
 The shiny new stadium deep in the heart of Texas will still be waiting for its first Rangers game. Instead of warming up for his debut with the New York Yankees after a record $324 million, nine-year contract, Gerrit Cole is playing catch with his wife at home.
 With the start of the Major League Baseball season indefinitely on hold because of the novel coronavirus pandemic, ballparks will be empty today on what was supposed to be opening day.
 “You’re used to seeing people run all over the place. We have over 200 people (who work) at the park,” said Roger Bossard, the groundskeeper in his 54th year with the Chicago White Sox. “Certainly, it’s eerie when no one’s around. You walk around the hallways or underneath the stands there, and there’s nobody there — but understandably.”
 From Baltimore to Miami in the east, San Diego to Seattle in the west — and 11 other cities that would have hosted season openers today — there will be no games, or at the remaining 15 MLB stadiums, for at least a couple of more months.
 By then, when the weather will be warmer, the Rangers will be able to stay out of the heat by closing the retractable roof at their $1 billion-plus stadium, the only new major league ballpark opening this season.
 After the postponement of a Chris Stapleton concert that was to be the inaugural event at Globe Life Park on March 14, only three days after an open house that went on as scheduled, the Rangers were supposed to play an exhibition game there this week. Their home opener was set for next Tuesday after a season-opening series in Seattle.
 “The stadium was 100 percent ready to go,” said Casey Rapp, GM of the new Rangers stadium for Delaware North Sportservice, which also oversees concessions for 10 other MLB ballparks. “It’s the little things that we were trying to make perfect.”
 While there was plenty of time to finish construction of Globe Life Park, Rapp and his group haven’t yet been able to serve people during a full-scale event at the stadium.
 Concessionaires start planning months in advance of the openers. That means a lot of products, such as hot dogs, bottled beverages and frozen foods, had already been delivered to many ballparks before the season was put on hold.
 “It’s definitely different … it’s kind of unheard of (that) all the major sports inside the United States would be closed at the exact same time,” said Ken Gaber, vice president of operational excellence for Delaware North Sportservice. “Personally, it’s difficult. I think everybody feels the exact same way.”
 Delaware North has donated to local charities more than 41,000 pounds of food, including perishable items already sent to MLB stadiums it operates, and concessions from its other venues, including some NBA and NHL arenas suddenly shut down in the middle of those seasons. There were also several spring training venues at the peak of their schedules.
 The World Series champion Washington Nationals have reduced staff at Nationals Park, where a facilities group is still maintaining the ballpark and putting on the finishing touches for the season.
 “Prior to every baseball season, you’re always working very aggressively to get ready for opening day. That’s a fixed date and time and you just have to be ready,” said Frank Gambino, Washington’s senior vice president of ballpark operations. “We had been working very diligently, and continue to work diligently, to try and get as close as we can to ready for whenever opening day eventually comes.”
 Gambino said the Nationals were able to defer many of the concession deliveries and stocking of the stadium while monitoring the COVID-19 situation.
 There have been no reports of any MLB players testing positive for the novel coronavirus. Two minor leaguers in the Yankees system did, and the Red Sox closed down their entire spring training complex in Fort Myers, Florida, this week after saying that one of their minor league players had tested positive.
 For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks.
 The Baltimore Orioles were scheduled to open at home Thursday against the Yankees, likely with a clean-shaven Cole on the mound for the visitors. Camden Yards will be ready whenever the season finally starts, and the Orioles hope to maintain the enthusiasm that was whipped up for the team throughout a now- extended offseason.
 “The bright spot in this sort of cloudy day is that our fans will be craving baseball,” said Jennifer Grondahl, the Orioles vice president of community development and communications. “If we can put together a season and the entertainment that we have planned and add to that, I feel like we’ll be able to continue that momentum.”

The majority of those asked were positive about their experiences at Courtfield Lodge, however, with one family member saying their relative “has never been so looked after in their life, I cannot fault the place”.
 The home continues to be in special measures, meaning another inspection will take place within six months and if insufficient improvements are made, the CQC can begin the process of closing it.
 Over the course of the inspection, breaches were found in respect of people’s safety, medicines management, person-centred care, safeguarding people from improper treatment, safe recruitment, dignity and respect and governance.
 A spokesman for Courtfield Lodge said: We would like to apologise to all our residents, their family and friends for having fallen below the standard of care that we expect all of our care homes to provide.
 "The wellbeing of our residents is of paramount importance to us and since the previous inspection in May and June 2019, improvements have been made.
 “We have taken on board everything that CQC have stated in their inspection report and are working closely with CQC to address the remaining shortcomings in an open and transparent manner.
 “Since the inspection in January and February 2020, we have already addressed some of the concerns raised and further progress has been made.
 "We will continue to make improvements and will monitor the progress, to ensure that it is maintained.”

Now that spring has arrived, delightful thoughts come to mind as I think of the magnificent plants that illuminate the garden. I love large shrubs that take center stage but I also adore those early perennials and minor bulbs that brighten smaller spaces. These are ones that are not grown as often, those rarer jewels that need to be lauded. I do not have as many as I would like but some of those that I do grow, I want to sing their praises.      One of the first to break the ground is Ranunculus ficaria "Brazen Hussy," a plant I first saw when visiting a garden in eastern Virginia. This deer- resistant spring perennial emerges with glossy dark burgundy foliage that contrasts well with the cheerful daffodil-yellow flowers. The stark contrast between the foliage and the flowers sets this plant apart and makes it stand out from a distance. I have had it for about 10 years and it comes back each February like clockwork and then it disappears, as the temperatures get warmer. I have read it is invasive but I still have the two plants that I purchased from Plants Delights and it is not invasive where I have them growing.      Bloodroot, (Sanguinaria) is a charming woodland plant that emerges and quickly shows off white flowers that stand out against the brown leaf litter. I also am attracted to the shape of the leaves and find them to be quite attractive and interesting. The leaves grow larger as the summer progresses, sporting deeply cut lobes that are quite eye-catching. This is a North American woodland perennial that is called bloodroot because it has a red sap that oozes from the roots when cut. Native American basket makers used the sap as a source of red dye. However, they did not use it as face paint because it is toxic if rubbed onto the skin.      Many of my gardening friends grow Virginia Bluebells, (Mertensia virginica), a cherished native that delights us in spring with nodding clusters of pink buds that open to sky blue flowers. These charming bell-shaped flowers have cool, soft green foliage making a beautiful display in a shaded area of the garden. You need to enjoy them quickly because as the flowers fade, so does the foliage and, before you know it, they disappear and go dormant until the following spring.      Brunnera has also become a favorite of mine for the shade garden. This trouble-free plant has dainty blue flowers that resemble forget-me-nots. The flowers stand high above the foliage on thin stems that sway in a gentle breeze. The one I grow is called Brunnera "Jack Frost" and was chosen the perennial of the year in 2012 by the Perennial Plant Association. This hardy plant is grown not only for the flowers but also for the veined heart-shaped leaves that are green and white and, if it does not get too hot and dry, they look pretty all summer long. My husband thinks these leaves are caladiums leaves in the summer, a plant he wants me to grow. I do not tell him that those variegated showy leaves are not what he thinks. What he does not know will not hurt him.      Phlox divaricata, a perennial with delightful blue or white flowers, is another woodland native which forms mats of foliage with stems that typically reach 12 inches tall. My friend Pat Burton introduced me to this plant and told me to be sure and purchase the variety called "Blue Moon." It is a lovely native phlox groundcover featuring clouds of rich violet-blue blooms that float above green foliage. It has a slight fragrance to wake up one's senses, and it flowers in March and April where I live. It is a perfect addition to a rock garden or any shady spot where it can slowly naturalize. I have it by a stream and I am hoping that one day, the mats will become large enough that they drape over the rocks lining the stream.      If you like to plant bulbs or corms, you should try planting Erythronium, which is also called Trout Lilies or Dogtooth Violet. I grow one called "Pagoda" which bears graceful sulfur yellow flowers with a reddish-brown ring at the center. The flower is shaped like a tiny lily and the leaves are a beautiful bright green. I grow mine in part shade with rich woodsy soil. These deer and rodent resistant plants only last for a short time because, by late May, the Dogtooth Lilies have gone dormant for the summer.   Think about planting some to brighten up a small space where you want a little something extra. Many of them are called spring ephemerals because the plants last only a brief time. They bloom and die back and go dormant and disappear from view shortly after they stop flowering. I enjoy them and I hope I always have a place for a few in the garden. These early charmers are a joy to grow.      Betty Montgomery is a master gardener and author of "Hydrangeas: How To Grow, Cultivate & Enjoy," and "A Four-Season Southern Garden."

The statement came a day after Pompeo spoke to Mohamed Bin Salman, the country’s Crown Prince. As such, the statement shows that the Trump administration will put more pressure and likely use tools in its position to force Saudis to act. For example, Trump could easily place sanctions or remove US troops from the country. Meanwhile, there is a concern in the oil market that the world could run out of storage space as a sharp decline in demand coincides with rising supplies.

VIRUS OUTBREAK-INDIANAIndiana not detailing ICU capacity as coronavirus cases growINDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Indiana health officials aren't providing details on hospital capacity around the state as its number of confirmed coronavirus-related illnesses continues to grow quickly and two more deaths were reported. The state health department says Indiana’s number of confirmed COVID-19 cases jumped by 115 to reach a total of 477. Indiana has seen 14 total deaths as a statewide stay-at-home order took effect Wednesday aimed at slowing spread of the virus. State Health Commissioner Dr. Kristina Box says state officials are keeping confidential information provided by hospitals about their intensive care unit capacity and equipment availability. She said she’s seeing “positive movements” in availability of ICU beds and ventilators.VIRUS OUTBREAK-INDIANA PRISONSIndiana's inmates still eating meals together amid pandemicINDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Indiana’s prison populations are still eating meals together in large groups and mixing during outdoor recreation even as Hoosiers are keeping their distance as a stay-at-home order took effect Wednesday aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus. The Indiana Department of Correction has suspended visitation at Indiana's 20 correctional facilities and taken other steps in a recent directive.

After a fortnight living in a mobile home compound built in just three days by his employer, Italian gas company Snam, Guido Debattisti is returning home. The 37-year-old is part of a team of engineers sealed off during two-week shifts to make sure gas taps stay open - and buildings warm - during a coronavirus epidemic that has killed more than 7,000 Italians and is sweeping Europe.So far, the hastily-assembled plan at Snams control center in Milan, which remotely operates 33,000 kilometers 21,000 miles of gas pipes across Italy, is working. The team working in the dispatching center - made up of six people for each shift, as well as two colleagues connected remotely via Skype video-conferences - has succeeded in carrying out all activities related to grid control, Debattisti told Reuters, before heading back to his home in nearby Pavia.With countries across Europe in lockdown to try to contain the virus, gas and power grid operators are scrambling to roll out emergency plans to make sure their control rooms are safe from infection and can keep critical infrastructure running. Potentially at risk are more than 12 million kilometers km of networks, or 31 times the distance to the moon - Europes energy nerve center on which hundreds of millions of residential and commercial customers depend.Adding to the headache is a plunge in demand as economies grind to a halt. Because renewable energy has priority in supplying power grids, this has meant wind and solar generation providing a greater proportion of electricity than ever before.But these intermittent sources of power make it harder to keep grids stable, increasing the risk of blackouts. Debattisti, like the rest of his team, is screened before starting his shift to make sure he is not infected.After that, it is a lockdown in the compound with a kitchen and a small canteen for eating. In his 16 years at Snam, he has known nothing like it.ISOLATIONAbout 500 km to the north in Germanys motor city of Stuttgart, utility EnBW is considering a similar move to house key staff at the network control center. So far theres been no need to do that, a spokeswoman said, adding all the accommodation preparations had still to be made.Johannes Teyssen, chief executive of Europes largest networks operator E.ON, said hundreds of employees were prepared to live and work in dormitories and be kept in de-facto isolation to keep grids humming. Its not going to be pleasant, he told journalists on Wednesday.Italys power grid manager Terna has a plan B and C to keep the electrons flowing on its 74,000 km high voltage network. The company has six regional control rooms across the country and two central ones in Rome, each of which operates three shifts. Plan B involves shuffling around the business should any of the rooms go down, while plan C is triggered if two of the three regular shifts are grounded - in which case a team is segregated in a centralized control room for 15-day periods living in camper vans.The system means that with just 20 of staff, Terna should be able to guarantee continuity of service. At Austrian utility Wien Energie, measures have been particularly drastic. There, 53 employees have agreed to live apart from their families for potentially several weeks to make sure plants can run smoothly.They were checked before going into isolation at the power stations, where they will live separated from the outside world, Wien Energie said. Polands power grid operator, PSE, is also taking radical steps to try to prevent workers from getting contaminated and to keep supplies flowing.The level of security, especially regarding the employees movements within the premises of PSE, is analogous to the level that is launched during a high terrorist threat, a spokeswoman said. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, access to control rooms is being minimized and teams split to reduce the risk of cross-infection to keep energy flowing, according to the Energy Networks Association.NEW TESTS Alongside the risk of contagion, grid companies are having to cope with a slump in energy demand.Many industrial companies, most notably carmakers and suppliers, are suspending production, hitting demand and putting a strain on grids at a time when they are already struggling to cope with a high proportion of intermittent renewable supplies. The drop in demand is robbing markets of a key source of flexibility industrial plants often act as grid stabilizers by using their own power generators to help balance less reliable wind and solar inflows.System operators have developed ways to manage these challenges, but extraordinary developments such as lockdowns of entire countries during global pandemics create new tests, Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, said earlier this week. In Germany, Europes largest economy, energy consumption on March 23 was about 5 lower than the average for the same day over the past three years, industry association BDEW said.People typically think of power outages as happening when demand overwhelms supply, Birol said. But in fact, some of the most high- profile blackouts in recent times took place during periods of low demand.

 The film was all set to premiere at this year’s South by Southwest film festival too. They planned to take full advantage of the barbeque options in Austin, Texas, as a perfect tie-in. But the festival was canceled even before much of the country was being told to stay at home.
 “In my mind I understand it, but my heart breaks,” Penny said. “Obviously there are things a million times more important going on in the world right now. But you want to watch it with an audience and see it with people.”
 Still, he’s “happy people will get to see it in their homes.”
 As for what wine to pair with the viewing? Penny said not to stress.
 “They should crack open any wine they have closest to them and enjoy it,” he said. “Whatever you like, crack it open, crack open two of them and go to town.”

Eight and a half years into its grand tour of the solar system, NASA's Voyager 2 spacecraft was ready for another encounter. It was January 24, 1986, and soon it would meet the mysterious seventh planet, icy-cold Uranus. Over the next few hours, Voyager 2 flew within 50,600 miles (81,433 kilometres) of Uranus' cloud tops, collecting data that revealed two new rings, 11 new moons and temperatures below minus 353 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 214 degrees Celsius). The dataset is still the only up-close measurements we have ever made of the planet.


  Three decades later, scientists reinspecting that data found one more secret. Unbeknownst to the entire space physics community, 34 years ago Voyager 2 flew through a plasmoid, a giant magnetic bubble that may have been whisking Uranus' atmosphere out to space. The finding, reported in Geophysical Research Letters, raises new questions about the planet's one-of-a-kind magnetic environment.


  A Wobbly Magnetic Oddball Planetary atmospheres all over the solar system are leaking into space. Hydrogen springs from Venus to join the solar wind, the continuous stream of particles escaping the Sun. Jupiter and Saturn eject globs of their electrically-charged air. Even Earth's atmosphere leaks. (Don't worry, it will stick around for another billion years or so.)


  The effects are tiny on human timescales, but given long enough, atmospheric escape can fundamentally alter a planet's fate. For a case in point, look at Mars. "Mars used to be a wet planet with a thick atmosphere," said Gina DiBraccio, a space physicist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center and project scientist for the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution, or MAVEN mission. "It evolved over time" - 4 billion years of leakage to space - "to become the dry planet we see today."


  Atmospheric escape is driven by a planet's magnetic field, which can both help and hinder the process. Scientists believe magnetic fields can protect a planet, fending off the atmosphere-stripping blasts of the solar wind. But they can also create opportunities for an escape like the giant globs cut loose from Saturn and Jupiter when magnetic field lines become tangled. Either way, to understand how atmospheres change, scientists pay close attention to magnetism. That's one more reason Uranus is such a mystery. Voyager 2's 1986 flyby revealed just how magnetically weird the planet is.


  "The structure, the way that it moves ... ," DiBraccio said, "Uranus is really on its own." Unlike any other planet in our solar system, Uranus spins almost perfectly on its side - like a pig on a spit roast - completing a barrel roll once every 17 hours. Its magnetic field axis points 60 degrees away from that spin axis, so as the planet spins, its magnetosphere - the space carved out by its magnetic field - wobbles like a poorly thrown football. Scientists still don't know how to model it.


  This oddity drew DiBraccio and her coauthor Dan Gershman, a fellow Goddard space physicist, to the project. Both were part of a team working out plans for a new mission to the "ice giants" Uranus and Neptune, and they were looking for mysteries to solve. Uranus' strange magnetic field, last measured more than 30 years ago, seemed like a good place to start.


  So they downloaded Voyager 2's magnetometer readings, which monitored the strength and direction of the magnetic fields near Uranus as the spacecraft flew by. With no idea what they'd find, they zoomed in closer than previous studies, plotting a new data point every 1.92 seconds. Smooth lines gave way to jagged spikes and dips. And that's when they saw it: a tiny zigzag with a big story. "Do you think that could be ... a plasmoid?" Gershman asked DiBraccio, catching sight of the squiggle.


  Little known at the time of Voyager 2's flyby, plasmoids have since become recognized as an important way planets lose mass. These giant bubbles of plasma, or electrified gas, pinch off from the end of a planet's magnetotail - the part of its magnetic field blown back by the Sun like a windsock. With enough time, escaping plasmoids can drain the ions from a planet's atmosphere, fundamentally changing its composition. They had been observed at Earth and other planets, but no one had detected plasmoids at Uranus - yet.


  DiBraccio ran the data through her processing pipeline, and the results came back clean. "I think it definitely is," she said. The Bubble Escapes


  The plasmoid DiBraccio and Gershman found occupied a mere 60 seconds of Voyager 2's 45-hour-long flight by Uranus. It appeared as a quick up-down blip in the magnetometer data. "But if you plotted it in 3D, it would look like a cylinder," Gershman said. Comparing their results to plasmoids observed at Jupiter, Saturn and Mercury, they estimated a cylindrical shape at least 127,000 miles (204,000 kilometres) long, and up to roughly 250,000 miles (400,000 kilometres) across. Like all planetary plasmoids, it was full of charged particles - mostly ionized hydrogen, the authors believe.


  Readings from inside the plasmoid - as Voyager 2 flew through it - hinted at its origins. Whereas some plasmoids have a twisted internal magnetic field, DiBraccio and Gershman observed smooth, closed magnetic loops. Such loop-like plasmoids are typically formed as a spinning planet flings bits of its atmosphere to space. "Centrifugal forces take over, and the plasmoid pinches off," Gershman said. According to their estimates, plasmoids like that one could account for between 15% and 55% of atmospheric mass loss at Uranus, a greater proportion than either Jupiter or Saturn. It may well be the dominant way Uranus sheds its atmosphere to space. How has plasmoid escape changed Uranus over time? With only one set of observations, it's hard to say.


  "Imagine if one spacecraft just flew through this room and tried to characterize the entire Earth," DiBraccio said. "Obviously it's not going to show you anything about what the Sahara or Antarctica is like." But the findings help focus new questions about the planet. The remaining mystery is part of the draw. "It's why I love planetary science," DiBraccio said. "You're always going somewhere you don't really know."


  The twin Voyager spacecraft were built by and continue to be operated by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. JPL is a division of Caltech in Pasadena. The Voyager missions are a part of the NASA Heliophysics System Observatory, sponsored by the Heliophysics Division of the Science Mission Directorate in Washington. (ANI)

Salina


   


  John Schmidt, went to be with the Lord on March 23, 2020 after a long battle with Multiple Myeloma and ultimately complications from pneumonia.


   


  John was an adoring husband and devoted father. He loved the outdoors and shared his passion for hunting with his children, grandchildren, family and friends. He could often be heard singing to his favorite Doo-Wop tune or performing in a barbershop quartet. John had a quiet disposition but was a pillar of strength and his presence was larger than life. There's not a dessert he didn't love and was a lifelong Bronco fan. He travelled the world as an avid hunter but also enjoyed the relaxation of a beach vacation. John, a true gentleman and man of character and wisdom, was an incredible example to all who knew him.


   


  John lived in Salina, Kansas and is survived by his wife, Betty Tallman Schmidt, his son and daughter-in-law Willi & Sherry Schmidt, 3 step-children and their spouses Tracy & Dave Newman, Lisa & Mike Foley, Amie & Stephen Gulick, 13 grandchildren, 5 siblings, nieces and nephews, great nieces and nephews and his previous wife, Tschudy Griffith Schmidt. He was predeceased by his daughter Katherine Schmidt.


   


  John was born on September 19, 1943 to Clarence & Nora Schmidt. He grew up in McPherson, Kansas on the family's Hilltop Turkey Farm. After graduating from McPherson High School in 1961 he received his undergraduate degree at Ottawa University and his doctorate degree in wildlife biology from Colorado State University. John spent 40 years of his career in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado and Montana and the plains of Kansas. He was a faculty member at Colorado State University and later worked to connect people "interested in supporting a cause" for Ducks Unlimited, RMEF and then with the Land Institute from which he retired. A novice author, John was in the process of writing a book about the hunting club he proudly founded along the Platte River in Colorado - Drakeland Farms.


   


  A strong supporter of its mission, John served as a member of Rotary International for more than 40 years and was the President of the Salina Noon Rotary Club. In addition, throughout his lifetime, John was involved in many other philanthropic conservation endeavors.


   


  John loved our Lord Jesus Christ, bringing comfort to his loved ones in knowing that he is in God's everlasting kingdom. John was the love of Betty's life and a precious gift and he will remain in her heart forever. He was loved and adored by so many and will be greatly missed by all who knew him. John's family will celebrate his life at a later date. In place of flowers, donations can be made in his honor to the Land Institute https://landinstitute.org. 2440 E. Water Well Rd. Salina, KS 67401. For more information or to leave condolences go to www.ryanmortuary.com

Gold edged lower for the second straight session and retreated further from two-week tops. The downtick seemed limited amid persistent USD selling bias and concerns over coronavirus. Gold edged lower for the second straight session on Thursday, with bears awaiting a sustained break below the $1600 round-figure mark. The precious metal extended the previous day's intraday pullback from two-week tops and was being weighed down by the latest optimism over the passage of a massive $2 trillion US economic relief package. However, a combination of factors extended some support to the commodity and helped limit losses. The prevailing cautious mood around equity markets amid worries over the spread of COVID-19 continued underpinning the commodity's perceived safe-haven demand. This coupled with persistent selling bias around the US dollar further benefitted the dollar-denominated commodity and cushioned the downside. The greenback remained depressed for the fifth straight session on Thursday in the wake of the Fed's unlimited QE, which helped ease concerns about tightening liquidity conditions. This comes on the back of mounting fears over an imminent global recession and might strengthen the commodity. Moving ahead, market participants now look forward to the release of the highly anticipated US initial weekly jobless claims for the week ended March 20. Economists are looking for claims to soar to 1,000K as compared to the previous week's reading of 281K. The US economic docket also features the release of the final GDP print, which is expected to confirm that the economic growth stood at 2.1% annualized pace during the final quarter of 2019 and might fail to provide any meaningful impetus.

A lack of adequate information, financial support and medical care could see new arrivals and refugee populations isolated in Australia as the COVID-19 pandemic escalates.


  The Refugee Council of Australia released its key priorities this week after the federal government issued new coronavirus social distancing guidelines.


  Those priorities include providing a financial safety net and Medicare access to all, a simplified process for granting and renewing visas, moving people out of crowded detention centres and potentially placing families in regional areas.


  Council chief executive Paul Power wants the federal government to extend supplementary crisis payments to everyone in need in Australia - including those on non-permanent visas.


  "It's clearer than ever before that the health of everybody in the community is a concern because COVID-19 doesn't discriminate on the basis of people's citizenship or their visa status," Mr Power told AAP on Thursday.


  "With the international movement of people grinding to a halt, we need to take care of everyone now in Australia.


  "We cannot collectively afford to have people destitute, homeless and with no access to affordable medical help. The risk to public health is too great."


  Mr Power says the government's bridging visas policy encourages "insecure casual work" which has now dried up.


  Unable to gain government support, people are turning to charities that are also struggling to meet demand.


  "The situation is quite challenging and chaotic at the moment in terms of people getting access to assistance," he said.


  The Refugee Council of Australia wrote to a number of federal government agencies last week asking for a review of immigration detention centres in light of the COVID-19 outbreak.


  The council suggests people should be released on bridging visas or detained in the community, in accommodation selected by the government.


  Mr Power said this could benefit accommodation providers struggling due to the collapse of international and local tourism.


  "The refugee council and its member organisations are ready to work with the government to help develop strategies to extend this support to people who most need it," he said.


  New arrivals are struggling to access relevant and factual information in their own language because health messages are changing almost daily.


  But, Mr Power said, discussions did take place with Multicultural NSW on Thursday to address the issue.

SYDNEY -- Two cruise ships were ordered to leave Australian waters on Thursday, after a liner that docked in Sydney Harbour last week became the primary source of infection for the country's coronavirus outbreak.
 While remaining well below the levels seen elsewhere in the world, the number of cases in Australia is starting to pick up speed, rising to nearly 2,800 infections and 12 deaths nationally.
 Cruise ships have become a flashpoint after 147 of 2,700 passengers who were allowed to disembark from Carnival Corp's Ruby Princess later tested positive for COVID-19, a blunder that has highlighted official tensions in the handling of the crisis.
 State authorities have clashed with the federal government over who was responsible for the oversight, adding to tensions and conflicting public advice over matters including virus testing and school closures.
 Some state leaders have also flagged they are willing to push for tougher restrictions on social activities if Prime Minister Scott Morrison's government does not move fast enough.
 "Because of the lack of consistent messaging, because people had been flouting the earlier advice regarding social distancing measures, we need to move further and quickly to ensure that what we're seeing around the world doesn't mimic and occur on front doors," Australian Medical Association president Tony Bartone told reporters.
 The discrepancies echo similar tensions elsewhere. In Brazil, state governors on Wednesday defied President Jair Bolsonaro's call that strict restrictions be lifted. Bolsonaro, who has described the coronavirus as a "little flu" had called for schools and businesses to reopened.
 In Australia, The Ruby Princess outbreak sparked anger over why passengers, more than a dozen showing flu-like symptoms, were cleared to disembark without basic health checks.
 The West Australia state government on Thursday said that nobody would be permitted to disembark the German-operated MV Artania after seven of 800 foreign passengers on board tested positive for COVID-19 unless there was a "life threatening emergency".
 "This ship needs to leave immediately," Premier Mark McGowan said. "Our position is clear, we are not going to have a Sydney Harbour fiasco on our watch."
 Germany's Phoenix Reisen, owner of the Artania was not immediately available for comment.
 McGowan said a second cruise ship, the MSC Magnifica, which was refused permission to dock in Perth earlier this week, was headed out of Australian waters. MSC Cruises declined to comment on the destination of the vessel, which it has said has no unwell passengers.
 Western Australia is preparing Rottnest island, a former prison island turned tourist attraction, to quarantine some of the 800 Australians on board a third cruise ship, the British-operated Vasco de Gama. More than 100 other passengers, from Britain and New Zealand, will be quarantined on the ship when it docks on Monday.
 Ship owner Britain's Cruise & Maritime Voyages said it was carrying no unwell passengers or staff.
 JOB LOSSES
 With the number of COVID-19 cases rising quickly, Australia has introduced a series of restrictions, including the forced closure of pubs, restaurants and cinemas.
 Long queues have continued to spool around welfare offices across the country, while more than a quarter of a million Australians registered for financial help on Wednesday, according to the government services minister.
 Further job losses are also expected, with some economists expecting Australian unemployment rate to double this year to more than 11%.
 Flight Centre on Thursday said a third of its 20,000 strong workforce faced temporary or permanent redundancy, while retail tycoon Solomon Lew's Premier Investments Ltd temporarily closed all stores in Australia.

“At the moment we are reducing density everywhere we can, and for good reason,” observes Richard Sennett, a professor of urban studies at MIT and senior adviser to the UN on its climate change and cities programme. “But on the whole density is a good thing: denser cities are more energy efficient.

 TOPEKA -- Kansas Army National Guard Col. Lee Norman said the military prepares for war in times of peace.
   
 And, to a degree, so do civilian hospitals.
   
 Norman, who also leads the Kansas Department of Health and Environment, said crisis standards for care would guide medical decisions as the new coronavirus infection surged in Kansas. This playbook of sorts will assist physicians whenever demand spikes for intensive-care beds, ventilators and medicines, even drugs not yet clinically proven effective against COVID-19.
   
 What should a Kansas doctor do with two seriously ill patients and access to one ventilator?
   
 "We know, for example, that an 80-plus-year-old that gets on a ventilator with coronavirus is very unlikely to survive," Norman said. "Does that mean we abandon that patient? Heavens, no. We try to do the best we can with the most people. We've not gotten into that bad situation, yet. I'm optimistic we won't."
   
 On Wednesday, Kansas health officials said the state had at least 130 confirmed cases of COVID-19, up from 98 on Tuesday. KDHE estimates Kansas infections could double every three or four days and reach about 400 by April 1, which would put greater strain on personnel, equipment and supplies at hospitals in Kansas. The totals won't decrease "anytime soon," the KDHE secretary said.
   
 Health facilities in urban centers -- more than half Kansas' known infections are in Wyandotte and Johnson counties -- would become magnets for the sick.
   
 "We think we're two to three weeks away from really accelerating," said Steven Stites, chief medical officer of the University of Kansas Health System in Kansas City, Kan.
   
 Norman said Kansas officials were making an argument to the Federal Emergency Management Agency that sparsely populated states should receive medical gear and equipment needed to counter the virus in amounts proportional to the population base. For example, he said, the 4.5% positive-test result in Kansas with 2.9 million residents was similar to the percentage in California, which has 39.5 million people.
   
 Meanwhile, Gov. Laura Kelly signed a state budget bill allocating $65 million to support the coronavirus response in Kansas.
   
 Follow instructions
   
 Norman said part of the problem in Kansas appeared to be a willingness of people to circumvent calls and orders by health officials to stay at home, avoid social interaction and adhere to sanitation advice. He urged people to take home isolation seriously.
   
 "Unfortunately, people are looking at this stay-at-home order as, 'OK, what are the exceptions and how can I wiggle around them?' " Norman said. "That is exactly the wrong approach."
   
 He said it was "unlikely" incidence of the coronavirus in Kansas would drop off to a point that people could safely fill church pews in April on Easter Sunday as suggested by President Donald Trump.
   
 KDHE has 125 pages of requests from counties and health care organizations for medical supplies, Norman said, and the agency is unable to meet all requests. However, the state received two truckloads of supplies earlier this week from FEMA. Additionally, KDHE is working with various care providers to obtain ultraviolet light and other sterilization devices so medical personnel can reuse masks five or six times.
   
 Testing remains restricted, Norman said, because materials are in short supply, sometimes down to "just the gnat's eyebrow" before new supplies arrive.
   
 On Tuesday evening, Wyandotte County/Kansas City, Kan., health officials reported the county's second death related to COVID-19. The third fatality in Kansas was identified as a man in his 70s. He tested positive March 18, was discharged from a hospital Friday and entered the hospital again Sunday. He died Monday.
   
 "We offer our prayers and thoughts to the family and friends of the deceased. Their sadness is our sadness. Our own family and friends are precious to us, and so I call on each one of us to protect one another and stop the spread of COVID-19," said David Alvey, mayor of the unified government of Wyandotte County and Kansas City, Kan.
      
 Fiscal restraints
   
 Kelly on Wednesday signed a state budget passed by the Legislature last week that includes $65 million in funding for dealing with the coronavirus.
   
 Kelly warned against adding unnecessary spending when the state returns at the end of April. Already, the budget is $100 million more than the one she proposed at the start of January. A compromise package agreed upon by House and Senate negotiators before the Legislature adjourned calls for an additional $100 million in obligations from the state general fund to be added after lawmakers return at the end of April.
   
 "Practically overnight, the coronavirus pandemic caused upheaval in the stock market, shuttered businesses, disrupted supply chains, and cast uncertainty on our economic future," Kelly said. "We've never experienced anything this sudden and severe in our lifetimes. As we get a handle on our new reality, I urge the Legislature to join me in showing fiscal restraint when they return for the annual wrap up session. It is critical that we act with utmost caution until we get a better sense of what the true budget implications of coronavirus will be."
   
 The governor chose not to veto any line items in the budget.
   
 Senate President Susan Wagle, a Republican from Wichita, praised the governor for taking swift action to unlock aid appropriated to combat COVID-19.
   
 "Our working families, small businesses, healthcare providers and hospitals are facing unprecedented hardship," Wagle said. "Remember our state motto, ad astra per aspera, means 'to the stars through difficulty.' United, we will conquer adversity."
   
 Meanwhile, the Kansas Department of Transportation announced it was extending the deadline for local communities to submit applications for a cost share program to receive state assistance on local infrastructure projects. The new deadline is May 18.
   
 "Given the impacts of COVID-19 on communities across Kansas, we want to give our partners more time to develop and submit their cost share applications," said KDOT Secretary Julie Lorenz. "Getting infrastructure investments into the Kansas economy and putting people back to work will be a top priority of COVID-19 recovery."
   
 Plaquenil in spotlight
   
 Surgeon and former Kansas Gov. Jeff Colyer and physician Daniel Hinthorn, director of infectious disease at the University of Kansas Medical Center, made the case in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece for treating coronovirus with the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine, also known as Plaquenil, and the upper-respiratory infection drug azithromycin, with the brand name Zithromax Z-Pak.
   
 The combination showed promise in a small number of patients in France that were reportedly cured with a six-day treatment, the Kansas doctors said.
   
 "One lesson that should inform the U.S. approach: Use this treatment cocktail early, and don't wait until a patient is on a ventilator in the intensive-care unit," Colyer and Hinthorn said.
   
 They said hydroxychloroquine, with or without a Z-Pak, should be a first-line treatment of patients testing positive or presumed to be infected. The federal government should contract with manufacturers to ramp up production because the drug is in short supply, they said.
   
 Both were pleased that Trump touted hydroxychloroquine as a potential treatment.
   
 "We don't want to peddle false hope," they said. "We have seen promising drugs turn out to be duds. But the public expects an answer, and we don't have the luxury of time. We can use this treatment to help save lives and prevent others from becoming infected."
   
 Dana Hawkinson, director of inpatient critical care at the KU hospital and an infectious diseases specialist, said there was anecdotal evidence in the Kansas City area of rapid growth in demand for Plaquenil.
   
 He said coronavirus patients at KU were receiving the drug in a "very regimented manner," but expressed concern about potential shortages.
   
 "I need to stress. These are not benign drugs," Hawkinson said. "There are still people who are really sick with conditions for which they are approved and need these drugs."

Agriculture and other natural resource industries had some success in the 2020 Idaho Legislature session, which adjourned March 20, but bills legalizing hemp and changing the makeup of the Idaho Potato Commission were left behind.
 Social-issue legislation and an increased need to adjourn amid COVID-19 concerns dominated the late stages of the session, which started Jan. 6.
 Earlier action focused on an update and streamlining of all the state's administrative rules, reducing the volume from 8,000 to 6,000 pages, and revamping property tax policy in light of higher home values in growing population centers.
 The Idaho Farm Bureau Federation said in a post-session report that despite pressure from urban homeowners, “we were successful in avoiding any shift in property taxes onto farmland or other commercial properties.” Lawmakers voted to form an interim committee on property taxes.
 Food Producers of Idaho Executive Director Rick Waitley said the effort to streamline regulations greatly altered the session’s traditional schedule but will benefit agriculture and natural-resources sectors.
 “Even in our narrow corner, it is very advantageous,” he said.
 Ag and resource agencies’ budget appropriations passed mostly unaltered from pre-session recommendations. So did the budget for the University of Idaho agricultural research and extension system.
 Lawmakers this year restored the state Wolf Depredation Control Board’s budget to historical levels after reducing it a year ago in light of a surplus. Idaho's Fish and Game Department received additional wolf-related resources.
 Lawmakers also approved various proposals presented as benefiting production agriculture or related businesses.
 Some, like a bill on aerial pesticide application, reduce regulatory burdens. Others, like a new authorization for bonded wine warehouses and an expansion of inmate employment opportunities in agriculture, address recent needs.
 One successful bill clarified the method by which agricultural land is assessed, emphasizing the use of local data rather than aggregated statewide information.
 Planes used mainly in production ag and conservation were added to the list of commercial aircraft exempt from the state’s 6% sales tax. Lawmakers passed a stock-water rights bill benefiting ranchers.
 However, some bills considered important to agriculture did not pass.
 The legislature for the second consecutive year rejected a proposal to legalize industrial hemp in keeping with the December 2018 Farm Bill. The House State Affairs Committee narrowly voted to hold the bill instead of sending it to the floor.
 That left Idaho and Mississippi as the only states where the crop is illegal. Farmers supported the bill. Law enforcement expressed concern it would increase exposure to marijuana-related issues.
 Another bill that did not advance aimed to provide farmers and others with the same access to parts and diagnostic tools that equipment dealers and authorized repair providers have.
 A bill that would increase proportional representation on the Idaho Potato Commission, and make other changes, did not receive a committee hearing. For more than two years, some potato growers in eastern Idaho have supported increasing representation from that high-production region. But the bill seemed to lack industry consensus.
 Waitley said the rules review and some legislation showed there has been some confusion about commodity commissions, which are quasi-state agencies that collect an assessment from industry and spend it on marketing, research and producer education.
 “The message to our industry was that there is a real need for education,” he said. This is important as Idaho’s demographics change due to growth and as new lawmakers are elected this year.
 Food Producers has tracked at least 13 seats in the 105-member legislature that will turn over next year because incumbents chose not to seek re- election, not counting those aspiring to switch from the House to the Senate.
 House and Senate members from both parties this year formed a Farm, Ranch and Timber Issues Caucus, also focused on rural issues.
 Waitley expects the new caucus to raise awareness and “become a statement of pride for a lot of legislators eventually.”

The article, titled, “How Medical ‘Chickenpox Parties’ Could Turn The Tide Of The Wuhan Virus,” argued that a “controlled voluntary infection” programme could allow young people to return to work after contracting and recovering from the virus.
 Such a strategy, the article stated, could promote “herd immunity” and help save the economy.
 Many figures on the right have expressed concern about the toll on the economy from prolonged social distancing and from the closing of businesses. President Donald Trump said Tuesday that he would “love to have the country opened up, and just raring to go, by Easter,” a timeline that top health professionals said was far too soon.
 Twitter said the article posted by the conservative website, The Federalist, as well as a tweet about it, violated the company’s rules, which ban content that flouts the recommendations of public health officials on the coronavirus.
 The company’s policy requires the removal of tweets that encourage people to disregard social distancing guidelines or that describe “harmful treatments or protection measures which are known to be ineffective.”
 The action comes as misinformation about the virus has spread rapidly on social media, frustrating companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter that have worked aggressively to stop the promotion of “miracle cures” and other false information.
 The Federalist promoted the article to its more than 230,000 followers with a tweet that read it was “time to think outside the box.”
 Twitter then locked The Federalist’s account until the tweet was removed. The article was still posted on The Federalist’s website as of Wednesday night.
 Benjamin Domenech, the publisher of The Federalist, and Mollie Hemingway, a senior editor, did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment Wednesday.
 Dr Douglas A Perednia, who wrote the article, said he disagreed with Twitter’s action.
 “I don’t think they read the article,” he said. “They may be reacting to the headline, but they’re not reading the article itself.”
 Perednia, of Portland, Oregon, described himself as a recently retired medical internist who also trained in dermatology.
 Perednia’s article was published a day after Gov Andy Beshear of Kentucky announced that a young person in that state had tested positive for the virus after attending a “coronavirus party” held in defiance of social distancing guidelines.
 Perednia’s article suggested “allowing people at low risk for severe complications to deliberately contract COVID-19 in a socially and medically responsible way so they become immune to the disease.”
 Such a strategy, the article stated, “could be a powerful tool for both suppressing the Wuhan coronavirus and saving the economy.”
 “It could reduce the danger of passing COVID-19 to vulnerable populations, drastically reduce the amount of social isolation needed, reopen businesses and even help achieve the level of ‘herd immunity’ needed to stop the spread of the disease within the population” Perednia wrote.
 Some medical professionals strongly disagreed.
 Dr Arthur L Caplan, a medical ethicist at New York University’s Grossman School of Medicine, said that so little was known about who was truly at low- risk for infection and why that such a programme could lead to a surge in deaths.
 “It is dangerous and irresponsible,” he said. “To run around saying, ‘I’m going to take a lethal virus and deliberately infect you to build your immunity’ not only makes no medical sense, it gets pretty close to advising homicide.”
 Dr Andrew A Lover, an assistant professor of epidemiology at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, called the article “exceedingly ill-advised, and not evidence-based in any way shape or form.”
 But some doctors said it might be worth exploring strategies other than social distancing to combat the spread of the pandemic.
 Dr Daniel J Morgan, a professor of epidemiology and public health at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, said he would not endorse intentionally infecting people, but added that it was worth considering ways to increase herd immunity while protecting vulnerable patients.
 “I think that we do need to be open-minded about all potential ideas if we don’t see a great effect from social distancing,” he said. “What do we during the next phase of this?”

Evapotranspiration data has historically been limited in scope and expensive to access. A new project seeks to change that.
 Researchers from NASA, the Desert Research Institute and the Environmental Defense Fund, with support from Google Earth Engine technology, are working to create an online platform with free, accessible, satellite-based water data open to anyone.
 Farmers have expressed both excitement and concern about the prospect. Industry leaders and water experts say the project will have a profound impact on water management in the West.
 “The implications are tremendous,” said Andrew McElrone, professor and research plant physiologist at the University of California-Davis. “This will impact growing decisions, water usage, water rights and trading.”
 The project, called OpenET, will launch in 2021.
 OpenET’s leaders say its purpose is to improve “sustainable water management” for communities, rivers, wildlife and agriculture. It is funded by charitable foundations, NASA, agricultural companies and irrigation management districts.
 OpenET is so named because it measures evapotranspiration, or ET, the process by which water moves from ground to atmosphere through both evaporation from the land and transpiration from plants.
 Forrest Melton, a senior research scientist with the Cooperative for Research in Earth Science and Technology at NASA Ames Research Center, said consistent information on evapotranspiration “is probably the biggest data gap for water management.”
 ET technology isn’t new. According to Maurice Hall, who leads EDF’s Western Water program, universities and other groups have used ET data for years, but the existing approach is “piecemeal at best.”
 “Given the importance of water, it’s surprising how archaic many of our tools are for actually managing water resources,” said Buzz Thompson, a natural resources law professor and faculty director for Stanford University’s Water in the West program. “OpenET could be revolutionary.”
 Draw a line from North Dakota to Texas, and those 17 states to the west will be included in the initial project, according to Robyn Grimm, OpenET project manager for EDF. The model, Grimm said, may spread to remaining states and other countries.
 OpenET will not make private data public, according to Melton of NASA. Instead, OpenET will choreograph fragments of already-public information, such as weather data sets and field boundaries, into one coherent platform.
 “Water management agencies and others already have access to this type of information,” said Melton. “But because in the past it’s often been limited and expensive, not everyone who needs the data has had access to it. I think having equal access to information can lead to better decisions, especially for water management.”
 Some farmers are enthusiastic about greater data access.
 “Right now, we use aerial imagery and infrared technology,” said Don Cameron, vice president of Terranova Ranch in Helm, Calif. “And we pay for it. If we had another tool, it would be really helpful.”
 Don Parrish, senior director of regulatory relations at the American Farm Bureau, said he predicts OpenET will cut farmers’ costs while increasing productivity and efficiency.
 “Saving water saves farmers money, so they have a strong incentive to conserve,” said Parrish. “If a program like OpenET makes cents — as in dollars and cents — then make it available to farmers, move out of the way and they’ll adopt it.”
 But other farmers told the Capital Press they fear the data could be used against them.
 “With the data going open and public, are growers going to have environmental groups sue their pants off for perceived overuse of water?” said a Washington state viticulturist who did not wish to be identified.
 The data may also be used to enforce water rights and enable water trading.
 According to Thompson of Water in the West, ET data has been used for at least a decade in regulatory and legal conflicts.
 “This kind of data will help police and enforce water rights,” said Thompson.
 In civil cases, he said, the standard of proof is essentially “more probable than not.” So even if data accuracy is imperfect — OpenET will have a 15% margin of error, according to Melton — it can be used as case evidence.
 But, said Thompson, a landowner always has other options to gather more fine- tuned data, such as hiring water consultants.
 OpenET has limitations, such as monitoring in areas with cloud cover over extended periods. But no system is perfect, said Grimm of EDF, and OpenET is meant to complement rather than replace existing systems.
 Other methods, such as well metering, continue to be important.
 Meters measure what is being pumped or extracted, while ET reveals what is leaving the system. Both factors, Grimm said, are important for water management.
 Grimm said because ET estimates are cheaper and less time-consuming, OpenET may allow farmers to use other technologies less frequently, saving them time and money.
 “I’ve talked to farmers who are eager to get their hands on this data,” said Parrish of the American Farm Bureau.
 Melton said OpenET users will access data through an easily navigable web interface — with maps, zoom options, irrigation district information, water use history features and more.
 The research team is working to make data available continuously, within 48 hours of measurement.
 According to Tyler Erickson, developer advocate for Google Earth Engine, users can request specific reports: for example, of aggregated water use for a watershed, administrative boundary or agricultural field.
 Those who want to dig deeper, he said, can access a programming database. OpenET will use optical and thermal satellite imagery with a resolution of 30 by 30 meters, allowing farmers to compare field to field, but not likely row to row, said Erickson.
 Farmers can also create their own secure OpenET accounts in which they can submit information such as property maps that will not be shared but will increase the accuracy of their own data, said Melton.
 “But we don’t want to just throw information at people,” said Robyn Grimm, OpenET project manager for EDF. “We want to contextualize the data.”
 Grimm said OpenET will provide videos, manuals and in-person trainings.
 “I’m optimistic OpenET will turn out to be more positive than negative,” said Parrish of the American Farm Bureau. “I know this makes some farmers feel uneasy, but overall, I think this could be a good thing for agriculture.”

Biden was once faulted for being too handsy in his interactions with women; now he was being criticized for losing his temper and insulting people during campaign stops.
 Biden dived in the polls.
 Democratic candidates such as Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Julian Castro, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren had all wounded the septuagenarian Biden, portraying him as too moderate and out of touch with contemporary green and diversity issues.
 Meanwhile, rival Bernie Sanders in the new year took over the lead in the polls. He focused on evil corporations, an unfair America and a rigged system. His populism drew crowds even as his socialism terrified the Democratic Party establishment.
 By early 2020, Sanders was feared to be unstoppable.
 Multibillionaire former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg jumped into the race with a storm of endorsements and paid ads. Bloomberg was supposed to save the Democratic Party from Sanders’ socialism in the wake of Biden’s implosion.
 Then the unanticipated happened.
 Sanders began praising Cuba and other Marxist countries, thereby confirming criticism that he really was too soft on communism.
 Bloomberg entered his first two debates and performed dismally. Almost overnight, he nullified his $500 million investment in a radio, television, social media and mailing campaign.
 But Biden just stayed Ol’ Joe Biden — occasional bewilderment, gaffes and all. As others sank in the polls, Biden seemed a known quantity in comparison.
 Other events lined up in Biden’s favor.
 The primaries headed to the South and West, where there were more moderate voters. On Super Tuesday, Biden was seen as less risky than Sanders and won a majority of delegates.
 Bloomberg dropped out of the race, as did Biden’s younger rivals — and most of them endorsed Biden.
 At no time did Biden cease his bloopers or embarrassing moments of forgetfulness and confusion. The field changed, not Biden himself.
 After Super Tuesday, Biden was, by process of elimination, suddenly the front- runner again in one of the more amazing comebacks in primary history.
 Democrats may have dodged the Sanders socialist bullet and united the party behind Biden, but how will Biden beat Trump?
 Biden’s threefold strategy is obvious.
 First, Biden will copy the Bloomberg playbook and avoid campaign appearances as much as possible, instead relying on ads, endorsements and the occasional short, teleprompter-aided speech.
 Biden also will name administration officials in advance and use a dozen or so of them as surrogates and anti-Trump attack dogs on the campaign trail.
 The subtext will be that the abstract idea of Biden is preferable to the concrete reality of hearing him speak or seeing him in action.
 Second, Biden’s running mate, with a wink and a nod, will be sold as the likely future president sooner than later.
 Diversity candidates who did not run effective campaigns and dropped out of the race now have a chance to be revived as Biden’s running mate — with a real shot to be president or at least to have a more influential role than past vice presidents.
 Such a running mate could help Biden win over the base. And he or she could solve the Democratic Party’s embarrassing dilemma of damning white privilege while ending up with two elderly white men as finalists for the nomination.
 Third, no one knows the trajectory of the coronavirus, but the economic damage it is inflicting on the economy is already considerable.
 Democratic strategists are demagoguing it in a way that seems analogous to the freak storm Katrina, which wrecked the second term of George W. Bush, or the 2008 financial meltdown, which ruined the Republican brand and, with it, the candidacy of John McCain.
 In 2020 we will hear a lot from candidate Biden — but less frequently will we see him in person, speaking to or mixing with crowds. His running mate will be advertised as the future of the Democratic Party, with the subtext of soon becoming president. And the 24/7 message won’t be collusion or impeachment, but the coronavirus.
 There are problems with all of these strategies. But for now, the Democratic Party has gone from ruin in late February to hope in late March — even as gaffe-prone Joe Biden just stayed the same all along.

Schockemoehl was a three-year varsity starter for the Golden Eagles and led the team in scoring both his junior and senior years. He also led the team in rebounds his junior year, and finished second on the team his senior season.
 “Coach told me that I was going to need to continue to step into that leadership role this season, both on and off the court,” Schockemoehl said. “I knew on offense I was going to need to score more and do work on the boards because we didn’t have a lot of size coming back.”
 Schockemoehl had been used more as a shooting guard during his previous seasons, but spent the offseason working in the post.
 “I spent a lot of time in the weight room working on getting stronger, and I worked with a personal trainer as well,” Schockemoehl said. “I also did a lot of ball handling and drills on getting to the rim.”
 Schockemoehl finished his senior season shooting 40 percent from the floor, while leading the MVC in free throws made with 92.
 “Getting to the line was important for us this season, so I had to be more aggressive in the post and made sure I took advantage of the free throws I was given,” he said.
 Schockemoehl also finished with 106 rebounds, 41 assists and 18 steals.
 “Jacob’s biggest improvement this season was his ability to get to the rim,” English said. “He did a really nice job getting into the lane and drawing contact.”
 Perhaps his biggest moment of the season came on an overtime game-winning 3-pointer against West Delaware in the Iowa Class 3A substate opener.
 “I’ve hit some game winners before, but never in the postseason,” Schockemoehl said. “That was a huge shot, and one that I’ll never forget.”
 Schockemoehl received second-team all-Mississippi Valley Conference honors and plans to continue playing basketball at the collegiate level. He recently announced his intentions to stay in Dubuque and play for Loras College of the American Rivers Conference.
 “It means the world to me that I will be able to continue playing basketball next year,” he said. “Basketball has been a passion of mine since I was a little kid, and playing in college will prove that all the hard work I’ve put in has paid off.”

Singapore said on Thursday it was planning for a deep recession due to the coronavirus pandemic as its economy suffered the worst contraction in a decade in the first quarter, reinforcing fears global activity will slump sharply this year.Singapore is among the world&amp;rsquo;s most open economies and one of the first to report growth data since the virus spread from China earlier this year, portending more pain for other countries as they impose increasingly strict anti-virus measures.Even though Singapore has so far avoided the lockdowns seen in other nations, its economy still shrank 2.2 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier, with heavy hits to services, construction and manufacturing, preliminary readings from trade ministry showed.The small Southeast Asian city-state is a major financial center and port, making it a bellwether for global trade, and is a popular tourist destination.The contraction was the biggest since the 2009 financial crisis and was below economists&amp;rsquo; expectations for a 1.5 percent decline. On a quarterly basis, gross domestic product (GDP) shrank 10.6 percent, the lowest since 2010 and below expectations for a 6.3 percent decline.The data prompted the trade ministry to cut its 2020 GDP forecast range to &amp;ndash;4 percent to &amp;ndash;1 percent, from a previous range of &amp;ndash;0.5 percent to 1.5 percent, and firmed up investors&amp;rsquo; bets for imminent fiscal and monetary stimulus.&amp;ldquo;This could well be the worst recession ever on record for Singapore,&amp;rdquo; said Irvin Seah, senior economist at Singapore&amp;rsquo;s biggest bank DBS, predicting a 2.8 percent full-year contraction.Economists polled by Reuters last week showed more than three- quarters believed the global economy is already in recession as the virus continues to spread, ending the longest expansion on record.Highlighting the suddenness and severity of the shock, separate data on Thursday showed Singapore&amp;rsquo;s industrial output plunged 22.3 percent in February from the previous month&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; the biggest contraction in official records going back to 1983, and far more than a forecast 11.5 percent fall.Just weeks after announcing multi-billion dollar schemes to offset the impact of the outbreak on businesses and households in its annual budget, the finance ministry is set to announce more relief packages later on Thursday (0730 GMT).The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), meanwhile, has brought forward its semi-annual monetary policy statement to Monday, March 30, and many economists are expecting drastic easing not seen since the financial crisis as global central banks pull out all the stops.&amp;ldquo;The extent of the first two months already tells you...how bad it is going to get,&amp;rdquo; said Selena Ling, head of treasury research and strategy at OCBC Bank.&amp;ldquo;The likelihood is that they will bring out a very big bazooka this afternoon, and come next Monday, MAS will also do what&amp;rsquo;s necessary.&amp;rdquo;Singapore has been battling the virus outbreak which has killed more than 21,000 globally since mid-January. It has seen a surge in mainly-imported infections in recent days, prompting it to order the closure of bars, discos, and cinemas and limit gatherings.On Wednesday, it recorded its biggest daily jump in cases, bringing its total to 631 with two deaths.&amp;ldquo;Singapore&amp;rsquo;s growth estimate is like the canary in the mineshaft and warns of further economic pain to come for other Asian economies as well,&amp;rdquo; analysts at OCBC said.Also, catch all the latest coronavirus pandemic related updates with CNBC-TV18.com's blog

A leading sports lawyer has warned the NRL and their clubs face the prospect of sponsors walking away in droves during the coronavirus pandemic.


  Sponsorship represents the second biggest form of revenue for each of the 16 clubs following NRL grants, and is worth millions in apparel, player partnerships and hospitality streams.


  A working group has been set up by the NRL and clubs to combat the issue but Brisbane-based sports lawyer Tim Fuller warned sponsors would be within their rights to stop paying clubs, particularly if the 2020 competition does not resume.


  "I think we're going to see terminations in the days ahead, weeks to come," Fuller warned.


  "They probably would be prepared to basically comply with their obligations under the contract as long as there's light at the end of the tunnel.


  "Otherwise they're going to walk away in droves.


  "The NRL have got to walk their way through with all these sponsors.


  "The next few days will be fascinating because there is potential for sponsors to leave en masse, and that'll leave a huge hole in club and game funds."


  Fuller said most sponsorship contracts would centre around the 24 games for each club, or the full 25 rounds plus finals.


  It's understood the NRL's major sponsor Telstra is in discussions with a number of sporting codes in relation to the impacts of the virus on the regular season and the agreements they have in place.


  Third-party player deals could also fall over if the game's stars are unable to fulfil their obligations.


  Staff at clubs have spent this week trying to find ways to keep sponsors involved and offer them some kind of exposure during the suspension.


  The Wests Tigers announced on Thursday they would stream video games against their respective opponents each week, with players wearing club merchandise.


  Other clubs were also looking at social media activations and streamed interviews that would still show players in team kit with sponsors displayed.


  Fuller said one option for the league and its clubs was to offer sweeteners to companies to stay on.


  "There could be some sort of negotiation between the sponsor and the game where there might be an extension of the sponsorship agreement," Fuller said.


  "Say for example Telstra's contract was due to terminate or expire this year, they might get an extension on that and be contracted for the next 18 months."


  Other concerns for clubs could be if the corporate partners fell into financial trouble, with most companies set to feel the pinch of the virus and economic slowdown.

Trainer Matt Cumani and his staff have been workshopping ideas about what may happen if racing is shut down because of coronavirus.


  Apart from a lone meeting at Narromine in western NSW, racing in Australia is currently suspended with jockey Mark Zahra potentially exposed to the COVID-19 virus after travelling on a commercial flight on March 12.


  Racing Victoria is awaiting the result of Zahra's test and if it is negative, it is hoped racing can resume on Friday.


  Cumani said it was a difficult task to work through given the different scenarios if racing was shut down.


  "Does a racing shutdown mean a training centre shutdown also?" Cumani said.


  "If we can continue training then it's a completely different story to if we can't train.


  "And do they set a timeline on the shutdown like they did with the AFL.


  "All those different things change the picture so much, so we are trying to work through the different scenarios."


  Cumani said the worst case scenario was having to put horses out for a spell which would in turn force the trainer to let staff go.


  "We're hoping at the very least we can continue to train because then the staff have a job," he said.


  "We try and take a family approach and a lot of our staff are full time which would make it a lot harder.


  "If we have to lay off staff then you need an awful lot of cash for redundancy payments and that might make it prohibitive."


  Cumani also questioned whether there were enough safe spelling properties to send horses and was unsure if that system could cope, which may then lead to a horse welfare problem.


  He also asked how long would it take to get racing back up and running.


  "There could be a lot of horses out for a spell and when racing is ready to resume there might not be the horses to race for a couple of months," he said.

Eight and a half years into its grand tour of the solar system, NASAs Voyager 2 spacecraft was ready for another encounter. It was January 24, 1986, and soon it would meet the mysterious seventh planet, icy-cold Uranus. Over the next few hours, Voyager 2 flew within 50,600 miles 81,433 kilometres of Uranus cloud tops, collecting data that revealed two new rings, 11 new moons and temperatures below minus 353 degrees Fahrenheit minus 214 degrees Celsius. The dataset is still the only up-close measurements we have ever made of the planet.Three decades later, scientists reinspecting that data found one more secret. Unbeknownst to the entire space physics community, 34 years ago Voyager 2 flew through a plasmoid, a giant magnetic bubble that may have been whisking Uranus atmosphere out to space. The finding, reported in Geophysical Research Letters, raises new questions about the planets one-of-a-kind magnetic environment.A Wobbly Magnetic Oddball Planetary atmospheres all over the solar system are leaking into space. Hydrogen springs from Venus to join the solar wind, the continuous stream of particles escaping the Sun. Jupiter and Saturn eject globs of their electrically-charged air. Even Earths atmosphere leaks. Dont worry, it will stick around for another billion years or so.The effects are tiny on human timescales, but given long enough, atmospheric escape can fundamentally alter a planets fate. For a case in point, look at Mars. Mars used to be a wet planet with a thick atmosphere, said Gina DiBraccio, a space physicist at NASAs Goddard Space Flight Center and project scientist for the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution, or MAVEN mission. It evolved over time - 4 billion years of leakage to space - to become the dry planet we see today.Atmospheric escape is driven by a planets magnetic field, which can both help and hinder the process. Scientists believe magnetic fields can protect a planet, fending off the atmosphere-stripping blasts of the solar wind. But they can also create opportunities for an escape like the giant globs cut loose from Saturn and Jupiter when magnetic field lines become tangled. Either way, to understand how atmospheres change, scientists pay close attention to magnetism. Thats one more reason Uranus is such a mystery. Voyager 2s 1986 flyby revealed just how magnetically weird the planet is.The structure, the way that it moves ... , DiBraccio said, Uranus is really on its own. Unlike any other planet in our solar system, Uranus spins almost perfectly on its side - like a pig on a spit roast - completing a barrel roll once every 17 hours. Its magnetic field axis points 60 degrees away from that spin axis, so as the planet spins, its magnetosphere - the space carved out by its magnetic field - wobbles like a poorly thrown football. Scientists still dont know how to model it.This oddity drew DiBraccio and her coauthor Dan Gershman, a fellow Goddard space physicist, to the project. Both were part of a team working out plans for a new mission to the ice giants Uranus and Neptune, and they were looking for mysteries to solve. Uranus strange magnetic field, last measured more than 30 years ago, seemed like a good place to start.So they downloaded Voyager 2s magnetometer readings, which monitored the strength and direction of the magnetic fields near Uranus as the spacecraft flew by. With no idea what theyd find, they zoomed in closer than previous studies, plotting a new data point every 1.92 seconds. Smooth lines gave way to jagged spikes and dips. And thats when they saw it a tiny zigzag with a big story. Do you think that could be ... a plasmoid Gershman asked DiBraccio, catching sight of the squiggle.Little known at the time of Voyager 2s flyby, plasmoids have since become recognized as an important way planets lose mass. These giant bubbles of plasma, or electrified gas, pinch off from the end of a planets magnetotail - the part of its magnetic field blown back by the Sun like a windsock. With enough time, escaping plasmoids can drain the ions from a planets atmosphere, fundamentally changing its composition. They had been observed at Earth and other planets, but no one had detected plasmoids at Uranus - yet.DiBraccio ran the data through her processing pipeline, and the results came back clean. I think it definitely is, she said. The Bubble EscapesThe plasmoid DiBraccio and Gershman found occupied a mere 60 seconds of Voyager 2s 45-hour-long flight by Uranus. It appeared as a quick up-down blip in the magnetometer data. But if you plotted it in 3D, it would look like a cylinder, Gershman said. Comparing their results to plasmoids observed at Jupiter, Saturn and Mercury, they estimated a cylindrical shape at least 127,000 miles 204,000 kilometres long, and up to roughly 250,000 miles 400,000 kilometres across. Like all planetary plasmoids, it was full of charged particles - mostly ionized hydrogen, the authors believe.Readings from inside the plasmoid - as Voyager 2 flew through it - hinted at its origins. Whereas some plasmoids have a twisted internal magnetic field, DiBraccio and Gershman observed smooth, closed magnetic loops. Such loop-like plasmoids are typically formed as a spinning planet flings bits of its atmosphere to space. Centrifugal forces take over, and the plasmoid pinches off, Gershman said.

“It’s a little bit tough because at the end of the day my contract, that’s my salary,” Crouser said. “That’s where I make the majority of my money.”


  Right now, of course, it’s hard enough just to stay in shape amid a stay-at- home order because of the coronavirus pandemic, but the Oregon native, who is training in Arkansas, knows he has to use this time to his advantage in order to secure his future.


  “It will hopefully put me in a position where I could throw far and prove myself going into re-signing a contract,” Crouser, who is sponsored by Nike, said. “Just to say I wasn’t really sitting on the couch this whole time.”


  The sponsorship executives in the Olympic world can’t afford to slouch around either as they navigate the ramifications of an unprecedented delay to the Games caused by the virus.


  Marketing plans for an Olympics that was meant to start in Tokyo July 24 are now in flux. Promotional material and ads that have already been shot may have to be discarded and remade at great costs, potentially with different athletes.


  Then there is the delicate matter of renegotiating contracts, from all those individual endorsement deals to the top-tier Olympic sponsors who were only signed up through 2020.


  “These games are called the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020,” International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach said Wednesday, “therefore for me it’s a logical consequence that the sponsors ... keep their rights even if the Games are organized in ’21.”


  For big conglomerates like General Electric and consumer goods firm Proctor and Gamble, it might seem like getting an additional year added to their association with the Olympics should be of great value.


  That could be offset by the costs of the virus wiping out so many planned sponsorship events and commercials that would soon have been appearing across the world.


  “I don’t think there’s a fair claim to say you should suddenly pay more,” former IOC marketing director Michael Payne, who now advises Olympic sponsors, said. “I think whatever is due to be paid in 2022 could be split 50-50 so half is in 2020 and the other half in 2021.”


  Securing funding as an athlete is more complex, and uncertain.


  Olympic hopefuls will be relying on the budgeted funding through 2020, from sponsors and domestic Olympic funding programs, and now need to finance the extended buildup to a games in 2021.


  The lawyers will be busy poring over contracts.

“We’re so grateful you have our backs. People talk about the pressure sportsmen and women are under to perform, but the truth is we get to do something we love every day for a living. We play games,” he noted.
 In New Zealand, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases stands at 262 but there hasn’t been any deaths so far.
 “Real pressure is working to save lives. Real pressure is going into work each day while putting your own personal safety on the line for the good of others,” Williamson observed.
 The right-handed batsman, one of the most revered modern-day cricketers who leads a team admired for its grace and fairplay, said he wants his country’s health workers to always know that the entire nation is firmly standing by them in this crisis.
 “It’s an enormous responsibility that can only be carried out by the best kind of people: those who put the greater good ahead of all else. As Black Caps, we know how amazing it feels to have the support of a country behind you.
 “In that same vein, we need you to know you’re not alone. We want you to know that there’s a whole country behind you,” he said.
 “We will get through this and you are a big reason why,” he added.
 Williamson led New Zealand to the final of the ODI World Cup in England last year. The side lost the final to the hosts in an unprecedented boundary count- back after scores were tied even after the Super Over.
 Williamson and his team were lauded for showing grace in what was a crushing defeat.

Now that the Tokyo Games are officially on hold until 2021, the next big issue that must be decided is when to reschedule this mammoth, 2½-week-long event.


  “That’s a loaded question,” American swimming star Ryan Murphy, who won three gold medals in Rio, said Wednesday. “There’s so many factors.”


  The International Olympic Committee says the Games will be held no later than the summer of 2021, which could mean simply pushing it back to roughly the same spot on the calendar as this year. The opening ceremony had been set for July 24, but those plans were officially scrapped Tuesday because of the worldwide virus pandemic.


  While the postponement was a jarring, unprecedented decision, that might wind up being the easiest call for the IOC.


  The suits in Lausanne face a much trickier issue in the next few weeks — nailing down exact dates for staging the Olympics so everyone can start adjusting their plans.


  Cornel Marculescu, who runs the powerful FINA, overseeing international water sports, says the IOC is pondering two options — the normal window in the middle of summer and earlier spring dates, perhaps slotted right after the Masters golf tournament but before tennis’ French Open.


  That could mean, for instance, the opening ceremony April 16, with the games running through May 2.


  The various sport federations are likely to favor a spring date because it would cause less disruption to the 2021 summer sports calendar, highlighted by the rescheduled European men’s soccer championship and world championships for two of the biggest Olympic sports — track and swimming.


  If the Olympics are held earlier than usual, those events in Eugene (track and field) and Fukuoka, Japan (swimming and other aquatic sports), could stay in their current slots.


  The biggest appeal of a spring Olympics is the weather.


  Summers are hot in Tokyo, with temperatures climbing well into the 90s Fahrenheit accompanied by stifling humidity. Worries about the heat pushed the IOC to order the marathon and race walks moved to the northern Japanese city of Sapporo, despite angry opposition from local organizers.


  There were also calls to shift open water swimming out of Tokyo Bay because of high water temperatures, though the IOC has insisted that no other sports would be moved.


  If the Olympics were held in spring, the marathon could move back to Tokyo and there wouldn’t be any worries about the humidity affecting any of the athletes competing in outdoor venues.


  The cooler temperatures would make things more pleasant for the more than one million fans expected to attend.


  Still, the idea of staging the Olympics in the spring comes with plenty of drawbacks.

Prominent players such as Dibyendu Barua, Swati Ghate and Abhijit Kunte have joined hands to form a Chess Players Forum with an aim to protect interest of the players and take up their issues with the government and other authorities. "Welcome to a new chapter in the History of Indian Chess! The Chess Players Forum has been founded to give a voice to the chess players of India for their own welfare and rights, as well as duties," the Forum wrote on its website.


  "We are a democratic and transparent organisation to empower chess players to play a part in their own destinies and in the growth of the game. "The Forum aims to present the chess players’ voice to the governing bodies of the game as well as to the Government of India, and to liaise with them on various issues involving chess players." The founder members and current office- bearers are: IM Varugeese Koshy (President), GM Dibyendu Barua (Vice President), IM V Saravanan (Secretary), WGM Swati Ghate (Treasurer), GM Abhijit Kunte, IM Neeraj Mishra and IM (Correspondence) N R Anil Kumar (all Managing Committee members).


  The forum is registered in Pune as an association, as well as under the Income Tax department, thus under the ambit of legal and financial laws. The forum Secretary Saravanan told PTI that they will reach out to legendary Viswanathan Anand, P Harikrishna and the women's ace Konery Humpy to have them on board "We will be contacting everyone. We want all to join. We kept the formation of the Forum away from the public eye so far, due to the registration process. Now that we are ready, we shall propagate ourselves in a big way," he said.


  The forum on its website said that there will be democratically held elections between three to six months of its initial registration and office- bearers will be elected by a defined voting process. "We have ambitions to get affiliated with national and international sports/chess bodies and thus work for the growth of the game," it said and appealed to all chess players in the country to become a part of it.

The 2019-20 season was to be the last for former Kalamazoo Wings defenseman Kyle Bushee.
 The 35-year-old native of Otsego joined the K-Wings for the 2016-17 season and played for his hometown team for a total of three years. During that time, Bushee played in 192 regular season games and 13 playoff games where he racked up 28 goals and 87 assists.
 In January 2018, Bushee was named as the K-Wings representative to the ECHL All-Star Game.
 "Making the All-Star game at the age of 32 was pretty special," Bushee said. "That was my one and only. I was just married and my family was around for that and to be able to experience that with them was really nice."
 For Bushee, who spent countless hours at what was then Wings Stadium, watching the K-Wings as a young boy and then playing on the same ice as a member of KOHA (Kalamazoo Optimist Hockey Association), being able to come full circle and play for the team he grew up cheering for was an honor.
 "It's such a storied franchise," Bushee said of the K-Wings, "I'll always cherish my three years here. It's very unique to go from a kid that goes to every game and I was out there in my KOHA jersey to then actually playing for them."
 Looking back on all of his memories on the ice at Wings, Bushee recalled an interesting fact.
 "I scored a goal when I was five or six during the intermission of a K-Wings game as a member of KOHA and it was my first goal at Wings Stadium," Bushee reminisced. "And in my last game as a professional at Wings, I scored a goal in the playoffs."
 While the ECHL season was cut short due to Covid-19, it was not the virus that ended Bushee's 12 year pro career. Rather, it was a change of direction.
 During the 2018-19 season, Bushee made a decision regarding his playing days.
 "My plan, after talking to my wife throughout that year, was that I was going to play one more season, my final year," Bushee said. "I was really looking forward to it. I was having a great summer of training and skating. Obviously, that plan didn't go according to plan."
 During his exit interview with the K-Wings at the end of last season, Bushee said they didn't give him any indication that he would not be asked back.
 "My meeting went well," Bushee said. "They told me I was everything they wanted in a K-Wing and appreciated my effort during the year and felt I had another good year."
 It wasn't until the middle of August that Bushee learned of his fate with the K-Wings. After a meeting with the team, Bushee was told they decided they weren't going to bring him back.
 "They gave some reasons, which in my opinion, I didn't feel were warranted," Bushee said.
 However, Bushee admits, that is just how things go sometimes.
 "They have every right to do that," he said. "That was the decision they made. It sucks being on this side of it, but it just wasn't meant to be this year."
 For Bushee, the timing couldn't have come at a worse time, professionally speaking. Planning to remain in the Kalamazoo area, the Bushees had just purchased a home in the area and were expecting their first child.
 Other teams came knocking, but with the situation being what it was and the fact that Bushee's wife has a career of her own in Kalamazoo, the logistics of signing with another team just didn't work out.
 "It would have been a lot to put on my family," Bushee said. "I wanted to play my last year as a K-Wing. The thought of driving to Fort Wayne and back every day (two hours each way), just wasn't appealing, given our circumstances."
 Bushee said he was honest when other teams called.
 "I wanted to play, but it pretty much had to be Kalamazoo," Bushee said. "It was nice that other teams were interested, but it just wouldn't work."
 Bushee admitted tears were shed between himself and his family, but things are better now.
 "I felt like I had three really good years (in Kalamazoo)," Bushee said. "From being a local kid playing here, loved coming to that rink every day, loved that friends and family could come and watch...it was disappointing. It was just not the way I envisioned my career ending. But life goes on. It's alright now."
 One perk of not being a professional hockey player anymore is being able to be home on a regular basis.
 "I guess you don't really realize when you are playing, but it was a lot of weight on her (his wife) shoulders to handle the day to day duties and make sure everything was up and running," Bushee said. "It's nice to be able to take some of the burden off her and help out. It's actually been a real blessing to be home."
 Now that his playing days are behind him, Bushee has had time reflect on his 12-year professional career.
 He has fond memories of his time with the Wheeling Nailers and Elmira Jackals, among others. The goals he scored in overtime or in the playoffs are highlights.
 But most of all, Bushee misses the little things that were taken for granted then.
 "It's funny," Bushee said. "Now that I am a little more removed, you think of all the highlights of playing, but you miss the team dinners, and bus trips, sitting in the locker room and chewing the fat with the guys you played with."
 Bushee may not be on the ice as a player any longer, but he is still lacing up the skates as a coach for KOHA. As his career was winding down, he knew that he wanted to be involved in hockey after his playing days here over.
 "The plan was always to be involved," Bushee said. "And I still get my hockey release. I just love hockey and it is a lot of joy to see how much the kids love hockey and light up when playing."
 As a player in KOHA, Bushee said many of his coaches were former players that gave back by giving their time to help develop the young players.
 "For me to be able to give back and be with the kids for an hour or so on the ice is the highlight of my day," he said.
 The future may hold even more time on the ice for the one-time player as he has turned his focus toward becoming a referee. Bushee isn't sure where this journey will take him, but the dream, as they say, is kind of the same as when he was a hockey player.
 "I am hoping to see where it takes me," Bushee said. "Obviously every kid's dream is to be in the NHL."
 According to Bushee, the NHL has a program set up where they invite former players to come to an "exposure combine" where they try to identify potential referee candidates from the group. Bushee hopes to take part in the combine this fall.
 Bushee wished things would have turned out differently and that he could have ended his career on his terms, but he doesn't have any hard feelings regarding the situation.
 "I was privileged to call myself a professional hockey player for 12 years and I am excited about what is next," Bushee said. "There are no regrets, no ill- will towards anyone there (K-Wings). It just wasn't meant to be this year, and it is what it is."

“It’s an important enterprise and is of course particularly helpful right now,” McPherson said.
 The stimulus funding will be critical for small and independent institutions that do not have the huge endowments of Ivy League schools or the government backing of large public universities.
 The New Haven Independent reported this week that Quinnipiac University announced that it would temporarily cut pay for faculty and staff, citing “significant additional expenses for our university and lost revenues from programs that were canceled.”
 Roger Casey, the president of McDaniel College in Maryland, which serves 3,000 students, said refunds and credits for food and housing would take $4 million from its budget of about $60 million.
 “We’re hoping Congress can plug that hole for us, so that we can do right by our students and get that cash back in these families’ hands,” he said.
 But Casey said the budgetary effect of the virus was only one concern, describing the last two weeks as “trying to put together a jigsaw puzzle, on a roller coaster in a hurricane.”
 Small colleges with less affluent student bodies have “sent students back to digital deserts — and you can’t write papers on your smartphone,” he said.
 Even larger institutions are feeling the strain. Elite universities worry that they cannot possibly charge tuition of $50,000 or more if all they can offer is distance learning.
 Brown University announced a freeze in faculty hiring for the current and next fiscal years.
 “The financial consequences resulting from the increased expenditures and the dramatic reductions in revenue provoked by the current pandemic demand prompt attention,” its leaders wrote in a letter to the community.
 Harvard, whose president, Lawrence Bacow, tested positive for the coronavirus, is under pressure to continue paying employees, although many of their facilities, such as dining halls, will be closed through the end of the semester. The university, which has a $40 billion endowment, agreed to pay some employees for 30 days. In a statement to The Harvard Crimson newspaper, it said “the economic impact of this rapidly evolving public health crisis is one that is hitting employers of all sizes, not just higher education institutions.”
 Duke University has promised to continue paying through May 31 all of its full-time employees, including contract workers in its food service facilities and in two hotels that the university owns but that are operated by vendors. As part of that effort, Duke officials said, they might have to assign some of them to new jobs.
 Last week, the university issued a call to Duke employees asking for volunteers to work in its health system. In the first hour, 650 employees had agreed; by Friday, the number had risen to more than 1,000.
