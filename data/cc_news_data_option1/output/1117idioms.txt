In so many words, Ohio High School Athletic Executive Director Jerry Snodgrass made something painfully clear during a news conference Thursday:
   
 The spring sports season, in limbo because of the statewide closure of schools during the COVID-19 pandemic, is in serious jeopardy. Meanwhile, the future is even more dire for the remaining winter state tournaments - boys and girls basketball, wrestling and ice hockey - that were postponed last week.
   
 Snodgrass on Thursday stopped short of making any official cancellations before a limited gathering of media members, but emphasized that many of his decisions will be hastened by those of Gov. Mike DeWine and Ohio's health authorities.
   
 "Governor DeWine said (Wednesday) that this is a severe virus that we must go to war with and defeat," Snodgrass said. "It's not just that I'm waiting for his recommendation. If it's obvious - and he's used that word regarding school closure - it's an overriding factor."
      
 Off the record, an OHSAA member said the news conference initially was scheduled for last weekend because Snodgrass believed DeWine was on the verge of shutting down schools for the remainder of the year. That move, obviously, would mean the end of sports, as well.
   
 Since the onset of the coronavirus threat, which has prompted the stoppage of college and professional sports worldwide, Snodgrass said he and his staff have carefully examined all the "what-ifs" regarding resumption of play.
   
 Currently, a three-week "no contact" policy involving athletics is in place until schools are slated to resume April 6.
   
 Regarding the rest of the winter state tournaments, Snodgrass indicated that a decision may be coming within 48 hours.
   
 "The window is rapidly closing on the winter sports tournaments," he said. "Off the top of my head, I'd say that those couldn't be resumed until mid-May and I doubt if we could pull that off.
   
 "A lot of factors enter into how, when and why and, believe me, we've examined every angle. The bottom line is, any decision overnight by the governor could dramatically change any schedule or timeline."
   
 Citing the number of participants (621), availability of a facility and potential weight management issues, Snodgrass said that rescheduling the wrestling tournament would be "very difficult … almost impossible."
   
 With college facilities shut down for the rest of the school year, the OHSAA reportedly reached out to some high schools to gauge interest in hosting the event and were met with resistance because of the sheer number of competitors and fans in close proximity.
   
 "My initial thought would be that if one of the winter tournaments would be canceled, all of them would be," Snodgrass said.
   
 The status of spring sports, he added, would hinge on how soon, or if, classes resume. Snodgrass conceded that it's possible spring sports could essentially return in early- to mid-May - about the time postseason tournaments are set to begin.
   
 "We have a little bit of wiggle room there and we've kept that window open for what-ifs," he said.
   
 As a former teacher, coach and administrator, Snodgrass is in tune with the emotions of athletes and fans. He said he has heard from plenty of them via social media and email.
   
 Snodgrass estimated that the OHSAA, a nonprofit organization, will lose in the neighborhood of $1.5 million by canceling its winter tournaments.
   
 "This is emotional for everybody but this is about a larger purpose," he said. "Our No. 1 priority is to fight this pandemic and keep our kids, parents and officials safe."

Montgomery had even been beaten in the race to cross the Rhine by the Americans taking the bridge at Remagen on 7 March and Patton securing a bridgehead south of Mainz. Once 21st Army Group was across the Rhine on 24 March, Montgomery lost the American 9th Army from his command, and the British were sidelined in the north. All his hopes of leading the advance on Berlin from the west were dashed. He was ordered to head for Denmark via Hamburg. Churchill’s desire to reach Berlin and “shake hands with the Russians as far to the east as possible,” was ignored. Eisenhower, who had started to believe in an Alpine Redoubt to which the remaining German forces would withdraw, intended to send the bulk of his forces across central and southern Germany.

Een donderslag bij heldere hemel was het toch een beetje. El Kababri maakte op 28 juli zijn debuut in de Jupiler Pro League en mocht meteen starten in de basis tegen KV Oostende. Het was zijn eerste en meteen ook zijn laatste wapenfeit bij Anderlecht.
 De 20-jarige back/ verdedigende middenvelder verdween daarna geleidelijk naar het achterplan bij paars-wit, maar Dortmund hield de belofte ondertussen klaarblijkelijk wel nauwlettend in de gaten. De Borussen zetten een opmerkelijke constructie op poten met Zulte Waregem.
 ## Symbolische euro
 Essevee mocht El Kababri kopen, maar Dortmund kan hem op elk moment terughalen voor een symbolische euro. Dat beweert _Sport/Voetbalmagazine_. De Borussen wilden aanvankelijk de youngster bij Greuther Furth stallen in de 2. Bundesliga, maar El Kababri wou in Belgie blijven.
 Ondertussen wacht het jeugdproduct van Anderlecht nog op zijn debuut bij de fusieclub. Francky Dury zal hem ongetwijfeld willen uitproberen in Play Off 2, als die er al komt natuurlijk.

Currency traders, who spoke off-the-record because of fear of reprisal from the Central Bank of Kenya, said the shilling was also feeling the heat from a deteriorating risk appetite globally that is pushing investors to buy the greenback, considered most liquid and safest.
 “Demand side (for the dollar) is more at the moment, and this is happening everywhere – not only to us,” said a forex dealer at one of tier-one banks.
 “It has come as a result of global forces and generally everything follows in line whereby the dollar is strengthening.”
 A weaker shilling will see the cost of imported commodities like cars, machinery, pharmaceutical products and clothing rise and traders pass on the additional shipment costs to consumers.
 It will also cut the benefits expected from the fall in crude prices, hurting motorists and households that use kerosene for cooking and lighting.
 The weaker shilling will also put pressure on the foreign exchange levy in electricity bills, which changes monthly based on dollar transactions by power generators and distributor, Kenya Power.
 The shilling had closed Wednesday’s session at 104.10/30 per dollar and traders said it had also been hit by pressure from foreign investors after global markets slumped.
 “The local clients are on the same page with global clients... Everyone wants cash and they want that cash in dollars,” a trader told Reuters.
 Kenya confirmed its first case of the coronavirus last Friday, causing the shilling to weaken and forcing trading on the Nairobi bourse to be halted after a steep drop.
 The confirmed cases have since jumped to seven and the government has shut down schools indefinitely, banned large public gatherings and limited entry into the country for people from countries with high cases of the virus.
 The travel restrictions, which has affected about 88 percent of foreign travellers, is hurting tourism that earned Kenya Sh163 billion last year.
 Hotels are reporting occupancy of about 20 percent compared to about 75 percent this season last year.

For most people, the measures required to cope with the coronavirus epidemic are inconvenient and stressful. But for restaurants and bars, the effect is severe and quite possibly disastrous. Being forced to close their doors to patrons through not only will cost them revenue, but is likely to put some at risk of closing for good.  
 That would be bad for their owners, bad for their employees, bad for their suppliers, bad for neighboring businesses and bad for their customers. The economic repercussions of this mandate, necessary though it is, will be far- reaching. So if you value that mom-and-pop diner and lively corner tavern, look for ways to help ensure that they will still be around once the crisis passes.  
 You could hardly blame those who own or work at these businesses if they're gripped by panic. "Right now, first and foremost we're in a fight for our survival," Rob Katz, co-owner of Boka Restaurant Group, told the Tribune. "Fixed expenses are incredibly high in our industry. And if cash flow ceases to exist, things get critical very, very quickly."  
 Some dining establishments have pledged to help their workers get through the crisis. But others have had to reduce hours or cut staff, at least temporarily. Employees who depend heavily on tips will be especially hurt. The kitchen workers, bartenders and servers deprived of their usual income may be unable to pay rent or buy groceries.  
 What can you do? A couple of solutions come to mind. The first is to order from those places that stay open offering food for via delivery, takeout or curbside pickup. Those orders will keep their kitchens busy and their income from vanishing. It will allow some workers, if not all, to keep working. It will keep managers from having to destroy -- that is, to waste -- fresh food as it spoils.  
 Buying out in lieu of dining out also allows you to save for another time all the rice, beans and frozen pizza you've stockpiled. And maybe you could use an excuse to get out of the house in a way that doesn't violate the social distancing rules recommended by public health authorities.  
 Another recourse is to buy gift cards from these places for future use. That way, they get the money now, when the need is dire, and you get to look forward to a good meal or night out later -- with the tab already paid. This option could be particularly useful for places that normally do a brisk lunch trade from workers in nearby buildings, which may be far away from those workers when they're staying home.  
 It's not only bars and restaurants that are affected by this disruption. Any small business or nonprofit that caters to the public and is shut down will also be deprived vital revenue during this period. If your favorite music venue is closed, you might order tickets online for a show that's weeks or months away. If there's a theater you like that can't stage plays, you might make a tax-deductible donation.  
 Once all of us start thinking about all the people we normally encounter who are being hurt by the crisis, we'll come up with our own ideas. Then let's put them to use.

Using again the argument that Poland was in the rear of his armies attacking Germany, he compared the situation to France, where he was restraining the communists from causing trouble in the rear of the western Allies. Churchill soon realised that he was out on a limb. Roosevelt, suffering from extreme ill-health, showed little interest. To Churchill’s horror, Roosevelt even announced without warning him that American forces would be withdrawn from Europe. The Americans simply wanted to finish the war. They showed little interest in the postwar map of Europe. All Churchill could ask for was free elections in Poland, but Stalin’s insistence on a government “friendly to the Soviet Union”, suggested it would be under Moscow’s control.

M.E.N. Sport asked supporters: “Who should be Man City's second-choice goalkeeper next season?”
 The overwhelming winner with 60 per cent of the vote was American ‘keeper Zak Steffen, who arrived in Manchester last summer from Columbus Crew but was then immediately sent on loan to German side Fortuna Dusseldorf.
 Steffen was instantly made first-choice and quickly started stringing together a series of impressive performances, showing that he’s capable of making great saves and comfortable on the ball.
 Sadly, the 24-year-old hasn’t played since the Bundesliga winter break due to a knee problem and Fortuna have keenly missed him, having conceded 17 goals in 10 games, slipped to the relegation places in the league and lost a penalty shoot-out to a fourth-tier side in the cup without him.

South Africa: 4IR Could Help Save the Day Amid the Devastation of the Coronavirus Outbreak - allAfrica.com


--DocBreak--
Former India captain Sunil Gavaskar believes the BCCI has taken the right decision to suspend the 13th edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) amid the ongoing coronavirus outbreak.
 "The decision by the BCCI to suspend the IPL till April 15 is a laudable one. The health and safety of a nation are more important than sport and it's wonderful that the usually much-maligned BCCI has put that before anything else," Gavaskar wrote in a column for Sportstar.
 The BCCI, on March 11, earlier put the IPL on hold till April 15 even though the tournament was set to start from March 29 after the government issued a travel advisory which made it clear that foreign players wouldn't be issued visas to come into the country.
 Gavaskar also said that the fate of the IPL depends upon how quickly the spread of coronavirus is controlled in the country.
 "Whether the IPL will be played at all depends on how quickly the spread of COVID-19 is controlled. Till April 15 overseas players won't get a visa so it may take a bit longer for the tournament to take off. Foreign players bring a different flavour to the tournament and add to the excitement, so it's important to have them," he said.
 The former Indian skipper also lashed out at a BCCI official for the suggestion that they did not want IPL to be like a Mushtaq Ali tournament without the participation of foreign players.
 "Having said that, for a so-called top BCCI official to comment that "the BCCI has to ensure the quality of the game is not poor. We did not want a Mushtaq Ali tournament," is an incredibly insensitive statement if indeed it is true," wrote Gavaskar.
 "Firstly, it's insulting to the great man after whom the tournament is named and secondly begs the question that if it's such a "poor" tournament, then why have it at all? Also, can light be shed on why the quality of the tournament is poor? Surely it's not simply because there are no international players in it, but also because there are no Indian internationals in it! That is a scheduling issue that the BCCI has to look at," he added.
 On Thursday, the Sports Ministry made it clear that the fate of IPL 2020 can be decided only after the government comes out with a fresh advisory after April 15, keeping in mind the situation with regards to the coronavirus outbreak.
 Sports Minister Kiren Rijiju reiterated that while it is the BCCI which decides on cricketing matters, the pandemic is something which has a direct effect on the loves of the citizens of the country.
 "After April 15 the government will come up with new advisory and guidelines according to the situation. BCCI is a body that looks after cricket which is not an Olympic sport. But here it is not the question of the sporting event alone but a question of the safety of the citizens. In an event there will be thousands of spectators. So it is not just for the sports bodies or sportspersons it is for every citizen of the country," he said.
 The Sports Ministry on March 12 made it clear that all sporting events should be cancelled in the wake of the coronavirus, which has so far claimed four lives in the country. And if it is unavoidable, the events should be held behind closed doors so as to avoid mass gatherings.
 The Delhi government went a step further and said that there would be no IPL matches in the national capital till March 31.
 BCCI President Sourav Ganguly also informed the media after the meeting with IPL franchise owners last Saturday at the BCCI HQ in Mumbai that all calls would be taken keeping in mind the advisory from the government.

Louth GAA take drastic action in light of Covid-19 outbreak

The Republican-controlled state Senate has one more shot this year to do the right thing and pass a smart package of bills to help the homeless across Wisconsin.
 The Senate has no excuse for inaction.
 All of the proposals have plenty of bipartisan support to clear the Legislature, if only Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, R-Juneau, and a handful of his stubborn colleagues would allow votes.
 We know the bills would pass because they cleared the Republican-dominated Assembly by wide if not unanimous margins. All of the proposals have Republicans co-sponsors. Even some critics of the bills who have raised vague concerns have said they support most of the ideas.
 So let’s finally get this done. The public can help by calling their state senator and demanding action this month before the Senate adjourns its regular business for the year.
 When Assembly Bill 119, which steers $500,000 more per year to homeless shelters, was taken up last month, the Senate approved it unanimously. Seven more bills remain, all of which have funding in the current state budget, which the Legislature approved last summer.
 The remaining bills would help desperate people find and keep stable housing, help the homeless develop skills for employment, and assist landlords with repairs to low-cost housing. Fitzgerald and others have questioned the cost, which is $6.5 million over two years. But that’s an infinitesimal part of the state’s $81 billion budget.
 Even if the entire package is approved, Wisconsin would continue to spend far less than what cold-winter states such as Minnesota commit to the problem. In some cases, the bills would save money by helping more people to improve their lives and become more self-sufficient. If the state can’t afford these bills, then why are the names of Senate Republican budget committee leaders Alberta Darling, R-River Hills, and Luther Olsen, R-Ripon, on several of them?
 Moreover, all of the bills are the result of hard work by former Republican Gov. Scott Walker’s administration, with Assembly Majority Leader Jim Steineke, R-Kaukauna, and former Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch championing the cause.
 The State Journal invited three GOP senators—Devin LeMahieu of Oostburg, Chris Kapenga of Delafield, and Steve Nass of the town of La Grange—to meet with our editorial board and explain their concerns. They didn’t respond.
 Fitzgerald was happy to rush a sweetheart deal through the state Senate to lure Foxconn to Wisconsin. Taxpayers could be on the hook for as much as $3 billion in direct payments from the state treasury to the Taiwanese-based manufacture if its plant lives up to its hype, which so far it hasn’t.
 Compared to the Foxconn splurge, the seven remaining homeless bills are bread crumbs. They would provide a modest hand up, not a handout, for struggling people including many single mothers with children.
 If Fitzgerald and a few of his colleagues want to snub this noble cause, that’s their prerogative. They can vote “no.” But they should at least allow an honest vote so those with more compassion can have their say, too.
