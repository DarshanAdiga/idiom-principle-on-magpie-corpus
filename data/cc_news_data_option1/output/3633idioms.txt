Entering year two leading the Lady Charger volleyball squad, Coach Shelly Smith is looking for contributors. Five of the team’s six starters graduated this summer, leaving room for new faces to play important roles.
 Devyn Nanomantube and Tommi-Anne McAfee are both back after putting in significant varsity time a year ago. Smith calls Nanomantube a strong middle and all-around player whose leadership will be a great asset. Madison Stirton, Carley Hammersmith, Taytum Hooper, Kelcie Lowe and Dalaine Molt have all worked their way up through the junior varsity squad and are ready to compete for minutes, while the team also gains Maliyah Soto, a junior all-around good athlete that joined the team this season.
 In a rebuilding season, Smith is angling for a winning year, and hopes her squad works as a team on and off the court and gives 100% effort at all times. To get there, the Chargers will need to put in the work on the court, and that is area where the coach says her team shines. “Our biggest strength is the athletes’ drive to learn and do better along with the amount of effort they dedicate in practice.”

As a student, you likely paid thousands of dollars to attend university online this year — and an additional several thousand more if you’re an international student. You’re facing invasive proctoring software every time you take a midterm and risking exposure every time you step in a grocery store.
 Whether you’re on campus, in your student rental or your childhood bedroom, your productivity and safety now rely on how cautious your roommates are.
 You’re facing a lot of choices as you embark on this new path, and a lot of difficult decisions.
 To match the strangeness of the past six months, we’ve made our annual frosh issue a little different too. This year, it’s like everyone is frosh: not sure how to get around campus, confused about how to access school services and figuring out a new study system with a brand new type of course delivery.
 The _Gazette_ is working (remotely) around the clock to publish stories students care about — because we are students.
 We’re facing the same questions as you are — is it a good idea to bring that friend into you social bubble? How vigilant you should be about wearing a mask outdoors? And will you even be able to stay sane after staring at the same wall above your home desk for eight months straight?
 We’re tracking London’s daily case count and providing student-specific news and updates. We’re concerned about your quality of education, especially given the hefty ticket price, and if the school is maintaining your privacy in the process. We’re questioning housing policies and emergency planning, because everything is up in the air right now — it’s like we’re all first-years trying to figure out where the Health Sciences Building is if it isn’t next to the Natural Science Centre.

For 32 years, I've been reporting on moving pictures. It's been a blast. But the advent of COVID-19 has taken a lot of the fun out of it. It's also left me more time to idle around the house, shut in because I carry the high-risk factors of age and chronic disease -- cancer, four bouts. My wife, Kate, also working from home, has many a time wished for me to find something to do other than pester her. "If you want to be productive, why don't you scan all our old photos and sort them into folders. Anything that will keep you out of my hair!"
 In the interest of self-preservation, I heeded her command, emptying the closets and depositing dozens of photo packets beside my PC. What followed was the epitome of rote. Grab two or three snaps, scan 'em, edit 'em and save. During the process, I started thinking of Paul Anka's "Times of Your Life." Then, at a certain point, the guy who writes about moving pictures was moved by the pictures of his life. Memories came rushing back, catching me unaware. Some elicited smiles, laughter. Others -- pictures of my deceased mom and dad; my high-school sweetheart, Sue; long-lost friends; and most especially Kate and me -- unleashed the waterworks.
 Where had all the time gone? And why does it seem I relish those seminal moments more now than when they occurred? Is it merely age and experience? Who knows? All I was certain of was how I wished I could relive every second the camera captured. It was impactful, existential even.
 It began with a picture of me surrounded by all of my closest friends from Omaha, shot in the middle of the driveway of my BFF, Bill, during a break between pickup basketball games. I thought about the divergent paths each of us would take over the ensuing 45 years. Life's usual trajectories: careers; marriage; divorce; kids; and, yes, misfortunes. Next was a group photo of my colleagues and me at our student newspaper, The Gateway. It amazed me how successful each of us had become. We literally covered the world. Some had penned books, others winning rewards for what they've written or photographed. Suddenly, I realized how lucky I'd been to know them all.
 I wanted to share the experience. I sent a few of the pictures to my childhood pal Ed in Colorado. Then, out of the blue, a Facebook message from Bill's wife, Cheree, in San Francisco. She loved the "driveway" photo I had posted and sent me her email address. This was major. Not just because I was back in touch with an old friend, but because I was finally able to express my hopes and prayers to Bill in the midst of his long, difficult recovery from a fall that left him paralyzed. The next day, Cheree's sister Michele in Chicago contacted me. She too loved the old photo of "our gang." Soon, she and I were catching up. Bliss.
 This was so great and cathartic, why not expand the circle? Kate looked to see if she could find an email address for my old girlfriend Kathy, whose photos I had kept. Simple enough, but why was Kate crying?
 "She's died," is all she could muster through her tears. "Who?" I asked, never imagining she could be referring to my Kathy. But, sadly, she was gone. I started shaking, tears streamed; memories of our years living together in Boston and Brookline came flooding back. I was stunned. Time truly waits for no one. I went on Facebook in an attempt to find her brother to offer my belated condolences. No luck.
 During the search, though, memories of my ex-fiancee Sue began to surface. I had lots of photos of her, too, that I knew she'd like to have. I looked her up on Facebook in hopes of sending them, as I'd planned to do with Kathy. Thank God, Sue was very much alive. I never liked the way things ended with us more than 45 years ago.
 So do I dare send a "friend" request her way? Would she reject me and make me feel even worse? Happy to say, no. Turns out she was thinking of me too. We exchanged emails before hanging a sharp right onto Memory Lane. The laughter surged; so did the tears and "what ifs." It was more transcendent than I ever expected. It had been 42 years since we last talked, but within seconds it felt as if we'd never been apart.
 Yet, it was the many pictures of my beautiful wife impacting me the most. What was it about seeing her in her youth again that evoked such adoration? Is it possible I was falling in love with her all over again? Yes, it was. And it couldn't be more well-timed, as I stare death in the face. As is the case with my friends and lovers, I have lots of pictures of my cancer, be it in my colon, liver, or lung. They're as much a part of my life as all those other photos. But excuse me if I don't place them among my keepsakes. And don't let the Big C know I'm having the last laugh, basking in the joy of renewed friendships and a profound new perspective on life. All of it because of a few hundred photographs. They are echoes of my past and a map to my future. Perhaps there's a similar encounter awaiting you in your closets. Take my advice and open up to see what develops. It just may well change your life for the better.

The Melbourne Vixens have secured the 2020 Super Netball minor premiership after a 61-53 victory over local rivals Collingwood Magpies.
 The Vixens overcame a slow start at Brisbane's Nissan Arena on Saturday to record their 10th win of the season and lock in top spot on the ladder with two rounds left to play.
 Star midcourter Liz Watson was unavailable after falling awkwardly on her ankle in round 11 and the Vixens struggled early with their connections without the league's goal-assist leader.
 But the Vixens had too much experience and versatility for the injury-hit Magpies, captain Kate Moloney the driving force with 36 feeds, 23 goal assists and two intercepts.
 Moloney said the depth of their squad has been a key factor in their rise to the top of the standings.
 "We've seen in our shooting circle or down at our defensive end, whoever we chuck on they're stepping up and it really is seamless," Moloney told the Nine Network.
 "We definitely need it in such a condensed season as well."
 Looking for just their second win of the season, Collingwood did not make life easy for their cross-town foes as they scored the first eight goals of the match on their way to a 17-12 opening-quarter win.
 But Melbourne found some momentum after Caitlin Thwaites and Mwai Kumwenda combined for three Super Shots in the first Power Five period, clicking into gear in the second quarter to outscore the Magpies 18-9.
 Leading 30-26 at halftime, the Vixens controlled the tempo in the second half to complete a season sweep against the struggling Magpies, late Super Shots from Gabi Sinclair and Nyah Allen helping keep the final margin in single digits.
 Defender Emily Mannix made her return for the Vixens having missed two games due to calf soreness and with the minor premiership in their possession, coach Simone McKinnis has the option to manage her squad's playing time heading into the semi-finals.
 The Magpies will close their season with clashes against the Sunshine Coast Lightning and Queensland Firebirds as they look to build for the future behind defensive duo Geva Mentor and Jodi Ann Ward.
 Collingwood's 2021 roster took another hit with Nat Medhurst joining Madi Browne in retirement during the week, the former Australian Diamonds goal attack calling time on her 17-year career having spent the current season on maternity leave.

Pepe Lacazette Aubameyang
 Without jumping to conclusions of a formation change, which I wouldn’t be surprised to see happen some time in the second half when Willian could well come off the bench to make his Arsenal debut, The defence more-or-less picks itself if you take into account the little time that new signing Gabriel Magalhaes has had to integrate into the squad.
 While some could argue that Martinez deserves to hold onto his role in the first-team after his heroics last season and in the Community Shield, The Guardian states that he is not part of the squad for today’s fixture, supposedly as he looks to secure a move away from the club.
 Will Willian get the nod to start over Pepe? Do the injuries in defence make a formation change more likely?

La spinta per la riapertura è forte. «Il governo dice che bisogna aspettare l’apertura delle scuole e solamente dopo si penserà agli stadi; non è possibile fare le due cose contemporaneamente?». Le parole del presidente del Coni, Giovanni Malagò, trovano l’appoggio della classe politica. «Certo che si possono fare tutte e due le cose – dice l’ex ministro dello Sport Luca Lotti, deputato Pd –, come si pensa giustamente alla scuola, si può e si deve pensare a far riaprire gli stadi. In sicurezza e con i protocolli necessari, come già accade per i palazzetti e negli autodromi. Ritardando l’apertura andremo incontro a problemi economici per buona parte delle società e non parlo solo di quelle professionistiche. Il calcio è composto da un mondo dilettantistico enorme. Spero che i ministri Spadafora e Speranza ripensino bene ai protocolli dei dilettanti dove ci sono diversi problemi. Il Covid-19 è lo stesso da combattere, ma le capacità economiche sono diverse. Comunque, iniziare le competizioni è stato già un bel segnale, ora cerchiamo di aprire al pubblico. Nel rispetto del Cts e della politica che alla fine deve decidere». Le prime tre giornate di Serie A saranno a porte chiuse visto che il dpcm scade il 7 ottobre. «Questo è un errore – dice il deputato Simone Valente, riferimento per le politiche sportive dei 5 Stelle –. Capisco che da una parte dobbiamo garantire ogni tipo di sicurezza ai cittadini ma allo stesso tempo va pure garantita la sopravvivenza dei club che senza ticketing sono a rischio scomparsa. Credo che si possa partire con capienze ridotte, anche in B e in Lega Pro serve subito il pubblico. Siamo un Paese strano: la sera possiamo giocare a calcetto e avere contatti fisici, ma poi non possiamo andare allo stadio con il vicino a 3-4 metri di distanza e con la mascherina. Davvero un paradosso, bisogna avere più coraggio».

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) — Relative unknown James Robinson has a chance to make NFL history Sunday. If Robinson starts for Jacksonville against Indianapolis, as expected, he would become the fourth undrafted rookie running back to do so in a season opener since the AFL-NFL merger in 1970 and the first in the last 30 years. If he runs for 45 yards, he would break the record for the most by an undrafted rookie in Week 1. Either way, don’t expect much reaction from the former Illinois State standout. He’s the quietest guy in Jacksonville’s locker room and among the least talkative in years. “I feel good about him,” offensive coordinator Jay Gruden said. “I’m excited to watch him play and I know he’s excited. He won’t show it, though. I haven’t seen him smile but twice the whole time he’s been here. He’s a very focused guy and I think he’ll be ready. I know he’ll be ready.” Robinson became Jacksonville’s featured back over the last two weeks, getting to the top of the depth chart after the team waived three-year starter Leonard Fournette and then lost backups Ryquell Armstead (COVID-19) and Devine Ozigbo (hamstring). Truth is, the 5-foot-9, 220-pound Robinson looked as good, if not better, than any of them in training camp. His emergence was the main reason general manager Dave Caldwell and coach Doug Marrone believed they could seamlessly move on from Fournette, who had been a disappointment on and off the field for most of three seasons. Robinson’s vision, cutting ability, burst and blocking turned heads from Day 1. His pass protection caught Marrone’s eye, and his professionalism and demeanor really sucked the coach in. His approach was the opposite of Fournette’s playful attitude. “You watch the way someone goes about their...

PITTSBURGH — The Pittsburgh Pirates spent the day honoring Hall of Famer Roberto Clemente. The organization participated in acts of community service. The players all wore Clemente's famous No. 21, the first time a Pirates player donned that number since Clemente's death 48 years ago. There was an extended pregame introduction featuring members of the Clemente family, a nod to a player who was an icon both on and off the field.

Austin-based health technology company Everlywell has seen its business boom during the coronavirus pandemic. The company's revenue has surged, and employee headcount has jumped from 80 to about 200.
   
 To help steer that growth, the company is bringing in a veteran health-care industry executive to serve as its first president. Andy Page -- who will be second-in-command to Everlywell CEO and founder Julia Cheek -- previously was president of biotech firm 23andMe and consumer digital health company Livongo. He was most recently CEO of medical tech company Caption Health.
   
 Cheek started Everlywell in 2015 in Dallas, and moved the company to Austin in 2016. Everlywell focuses on home health care diagnostics, including tests for food sensitivity, allergies, thyroids, hormones and vitamins. The company has also recently received authorization for an at-home test kit for COVID-19.
   
 Page spoke with the American-Statesman about his vision for Everlywell, and what it's like leading a company through a pandemic.
   
 How does your background at 23&Me, Livongo, Caption Health and other companies compare to this new role?
   
 I've switched industry and function fairly often over the years, starting with banking and then consumer companies, and then I switched to health care. I love the complex business models, I love brand building or brand challenges. I love trying to pull it together and mapping finance and strategy is interesting to me. It's a challenge getting up to speed in new industries, but the common theme is passion, for the consumer, and passion for the customer. Working in hyper growth environments like Everlywell is super fun.
   
 What's the biggest thing from these roles you bring into Everlywell?
   
 Responding to rapid change, and how to take lots of opportunities and prioritize, streamline and communicate. This has all of the raw materials from something quite special. We have incredible people, unbelievable market opportunity, we have a mission that we believe in, that is helping people, which is really inspiring and motivating. It has all those ingredients that I believe will be critical to driving success.
   
 What does your new role as president entail?
   
 I've learned, being the No. 2 person to a founder for the fourth time now, my role is to take on challenges. In this case with (Cheek), what are challenges and opportunities I can take on to free up her time? Where are the areas where I can provide some additional focus?
   
 It's already a highly functioning team, with great teamwork and mission. My job is to provide them experience where I can, help scale, and to look around those corners based on experience I've had or my gut instinct on what is needed. There isn't a playbook. I just try to apply judgment and experience and work with the people that are already extremely capable here.
   
 What's it like growing a company during a pandemic?
   
 It's really important to stick to our core mission. We will continue to be customer focused, and there's just so many different opportunities there.
   
 The trend of moving healthcare out from the four walls of hospitals into the home had already started, and its now being accelerated by years and years as a result of the pandemic. We're navigating those trends. And we believe that we can support our customer base even better, even faster, even more significantly as a result. We have the capacity to do it and we have a vision. We're providing additional products and services that we think will round up the offerings and make Everlywell a household name for healthcare in the home.
   
 What is your vision for Everlywell?
   
 I think that you will find that Everlywell, during and post the COVID pandemic, is leading the trend in health care for the home. We will be leading not just in testing, but in other areas as well. I believe it will be the first stop for people to say "what is it that I can do at home that furthers my health and curiosity and wellness and the journey I'm on?" That's something we're very proud to be able to provide today.
   
 In our health care system... as a result of COVID, everything started happening, much faster. The mission is being achieved sooner. And now, the brand having permission to do more things, additional services capabilities, and provide services to more people.
   
 What is it like joining and leading a company that is fully remote, and doing work directly related to the pandemic?
   
 It's important to constantly monitor and assess, evaluate and pivot around the way in which people are communicating, and the constant video calls. Normally there is a break in the day. Normally there are opportunities to have that in person interaction, which is so important for relationship building and for assessing a situation and that personal dynamic and so forth. All of that is squeezed out to the days are actually highly concentrated and intense, and people's commute is usually only about 15 feet.
   
 You just have to constantly think of ways of doing things differently, so that we don't experience burnout, or fatigue. We're trying really hard, but there is no playbook for that either. I think that it's a position of listening and trying to be attentive and empathetic.
   
 It's challenging but there's such a sense of mission. It's all just a constant reminder of why we do what we do.

Frances McDormand's Oscar-tipped road movie "Nomadland" raced from Venice to Toronto to California on Friday as major global festivals joined forces to jump-start the pandemic-struck film industry.
 The movie about a community of elderly, nomadic idealists who roam across America in worn-out vans was greeted by raucous honking horns and flashing headlights at a drive-in US premiere in Pasadena, on the outskirts of Los Angeles.
 Hours earlier, double Oscar-winner McDormand had received loud applause in Venice for her role as a widow forced to take to the road after a mine closes, wiping her tiny community from the map.
 "I told my husband... when I turned 65 I was gonna change my name to Fern, start smoking Lucky Strikes, drinking Wild Turkey and hit the road in my RV. I got to do that four years early," McDormand told the California screening.
 Speaking to an audience of Hollywood industry and press -- unable to travel to foreign festivals this year due to coronavirus -- McDormand said living on the road in basic conditions during filming had taught her humility.
 "I didn't know how to take a dump in my five-gallon bucket," she joked.
 The movie has received glowing reviews, with the Hollywood Reporter calling it "a unique portrait of outsider existence" and Variety a "tender ode to American independence."
 It's fast-rising director Chloe Zhao will oversee next year's Marvel superhero epic "Eternals."
 In regular years, movie festivals compete to host world premieres of such buzzy titles.
 But a truce has been struck in 2020, with Toronto festival co-head Cameron Bailey telling AFP it "didn't make sense to be competitive this year, with so much at stake."
 The night's California screening was organized by the Telluride festival -- one of several forced to entirely cancel its regular screenings due to a pandemic that has delayed the Oscars and halted filming across Hollywood.
 \- 'Heartbreaking' -
 Also debuting in multiple timezones this week was "One Night in Miami," an adaptation of a play imagining a heated 1964 motel room conversation between Malcolm X, Muhammad Ali, Sam Cooke and Jim Brown.
 Director Regina King ("Watchmen") told a Toronto festival virtual press conference she "wanted to do a film that was a love story with a historical backdrop."
 As well as depicting the four men's real-life friendship, the movie examines how each coped with the hostility faced by successful African-American men in the civil rights era.
 Completed in the wake of George Floyd's killing and mass anti-racism protests this summer, the movie's themes are "just as relevant now as they were 60 years ago," added King.
 Halle Berry, another Academy Award-winning actress showing her debut feature as director in Toronto, said it was "heartbreaking" no other black woman had won the best actress Oscar since her triumph for "Monster's Ball" almost two decades ago.
 She stars as a former martial arts fighter struggling to regain custody of her son in "Bruised," reportedly purchased by Netflix Friday, hours before its Toronto premiere.
 The Venice film festival concludes Saturday, while Toronto runs through September 20.

SAN MARCOS -- After a one-year hiatus, the Texas State-UTSA "I-35 Showdown" returns on Saturday, and second-year Bobcats coach Jake Spavital is eager to see what it's all about.
   
 "In my short time here, I've had more conversations with people about this game," Spavital said. "I've had more conversations about the I-35 Showdown than the SMU game."
   
 UTSA owns a 3-0 lead in the series. The two schools aren't scheduled to play again until 2023, but that will be the first of nine consecutive seasons the teams will play. It will be the season opener for the Roadrunners.
   
 "This year, (UTSA has) talent," said Bobcats senior linebacker Gavin Graham, who was a freshman and sophomore on the losing end of the rivalry in 2017 and 2018. "They are a good team. We respect them. But at the end of the day, we know it's a rivalry and we want to win.
   
 "To me this year, individual performances, everybody has their individual goals, but for me I just want to win as a team and do something that has never been done here before."
   
 Eight UTSA players will miss the game because of contact tracing. All four Bobcats who missed last week's season opener -- Tyler Vitt, Tory Spears, Jackson Lanam and Seth Caillouet -- returned to practice this week.
   
 UTSA, which went 4-8 last year, has a new head coach -- Jeff Traylor, a former assistant at Texas -- and a new staff. New defensive coordinator Tyrone Nix, who previously coached linebackers at Ole Miss, has changed the base defense to a 3-4 alignment and moved two defensive ends, Solomon Wise and DeQuarius Henry, to linebacker. Wise led the team last year with nine sacks.
   
 The Roadrunners' top three rushers return, but the team isn't settled at quarterback; Traylor has said UTSA may use multiple signal callers.
   
 "What I think they are going to do offensively is going to make them a lot better," Texas State defensive coordinator Zac Spavital said. "They were more of a two-back, bleed (the clock) out, run the ball and play-action. Now I think they are going to be an up-tempo, spread, RPO driven team."

Horse lovers can take heart to know their equine friends were not forgotten by those who made up star patterns, and chose which would be on the official constellation list. We have two celestial horses, and both are well in view on late summer and autumn evenings.      They include Pegasus, the Flying Horse, and Equuleus, the Colt or Little Horse. That's only two out of the 88 constellations. You can stretch things by adding Centaurus the Centaur, but in Greek mythology, the centaur is half horse and half man.      Pegasus is very large and prominent in the night sky. Since all constellations appear to pass over the sky as the Earth takes its daily spin, it may seem obvious that Pegasus is indeed a "flying" horse. Of course like the other ancient constellations, they were based on mythological stories and immortalized among the stars for future generations to remember.      The most well-known feature of this constellation is the "Great Square" asterism, a pattern within the constellation formed by four stars marking the corners. This is a stellar landmark.      Interestingly, the Great Square is not entirely in Pegasus. One of the stars is in the neighboring constellation Andromeda. Astronomers have plotted the constellations with defined boundaries marked on star atlases. In any case, Pegasus and Andromeda appear forever linked due to the Great Square.      Most constellation patterns hardly resemble what they are supposed to represent. The brighter stars of Andromeda and Pegasus, however, happen to be placed so that, together, it is not hard to picture more or less a complete horse, with the Great Square as the body. One problem: this extended "horse" pattern, as viewed from the Northern Hemisphere, is upside down in the sky!      Andromeda, the Maiden, is mainly seen as two strands of conspicuous stars. Imagined as part of this "horse," they become the equine's back legs.      Andromeda is on the eastern side of the Great Square (to the left as seen from northern latitudes). To the west (right) of the square are the stars we may imagine as the horse's front legs, neck and head.      As it is seen rising in the east, the Great Square appears standing like a great "baseball diamond" of sorts. There are only two stars easily seen with unaided eyes on a fairly dark night inside the Great Square; these might be thought of as "home plate."      Here are the names of the stars marking the corners of the Great Square. The star within the Andromeda constellation is Alpheratz. Going clockwise, the next corner star is Scheat, then Markab and finally Algenib.      Using Scheat and Markab as pointers, extend a line far down to the southeast to find the bright bluish star Fomalhaut.      The leading star in Pegasus, the one furthest to the west (right) can be imagined as the animal's snout. The star's name is Enif (or Epsilon Pegasi).      Enif is an orange supergiant star, about 690 light-years away. It shines at magnitude +2.4.      Going a bit deeper in the hobby of amateur astronomy, telescope users enjoy exploring Pegasus to track down several dim galaxies. Double stars are colored stars are also worthy prizes in any part of the sky.      A small telescope will also locate a fine globular star cluster, M15, just west of the star Enif. It appears as a small, dim, hazy patch in binoculars. Depending on the size of the telescope and magnification, you may easily resolve this hazy patch into a concentrated ball of faint stars.      Equuleus, the Little Horse, is a small constellation of dim stars, right next to Pegasus - to the west (right) of Enif and below M15.      While talking about starry horses, check out the handle of the Big Dipper, in the northwest on September evenings, The middle star, Mizar, is a fine double star, which you may be able to resolve with just your eyes. A faint star right next to it called Alcor. These have been nicknamed as the "Horse and Rider" (Mizar is the horse).   Then there's the Horsehead Nebula in the constellation Orion. Nebulae are vast interstellar clouds of dust and gas. The Horsehead appears very much like its name, a black silhouette superimposed on a more distant nebula that shines by reflected starlight. The Horsehead is very difficult to detect in a telescope, without taking a long-exposure photograph.      Be sure to see the red planet Mars, which this month (Sept. 2020) is very bright leading up to closest approach in October. Mars is dominating the eastern sky on September evenings, well below the Great Square.      Meanwhile brilliant Jupiter shines in the south in the evening, with Saturn about 10 degrees to the east (left). Look about an hour before sunrise for brilliant Venus in the twilight glow of the eastern sky.      New moon is on Sept. 17.   Keep looking up at the sky!
