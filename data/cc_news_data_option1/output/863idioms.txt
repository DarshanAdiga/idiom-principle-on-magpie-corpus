Buoyed by his win in the South Carolina Democratic primary, former Vice President Joe Biden appears to be gearing up for a tough battle with Sen. Bernie Sanders (S-USSR) for the chance to face President Donald Trump in November. The case for Biden rests on two claims: he is the most likely to defeat Trump and he is the "return to normalcy" candidate. His electability argument picked up steam in South Carolina, but this return to normalcy claim is deceptive.


  The "return to normalcy" theme dates back at least to the election of 1920 when Warren G. Harding won the presidency after the tumultuous — and in many ways disastrous — years of Woodrow Wilson. Harding promised to restore America, returning it to a time before Wilson's war socialism, before the devastating 1918-1919 Influenza pandemic, and before Wilson had proposed the unpopular international body that would become the United Nations. Harding won a landslide victory, with 60 percent of the vote and carrying 37 out of 48 states (Alaska and Hawaii would become states in 1959).


  Biden appears to be adopting a version of Harding's strategy. In slamming Sanders during his South Carolina victory speech, the former VP said, "winning means uniting America." He launched his campaign with a promise to restore the "soul of this nation." Biden is running on nostalgia for the first black president and he has insisted that Trump's presidency is an "aberrant moment in time." He warned that if Trump were to be re-elected, the president would "forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation, who we are."

After many years of manufacturing metal blades, Erickson has invested in the future of the S-64 rotorcraft by designing, certifying, and building composite main rotor blades that will bring many dramatic benefits. Erickson began the process of designing the new blades in 2008, working closely with the FAA and various industry partners. In 2013 Erickson collaborated with Helicopter Transport Services (HTS), so the blades could be utilized on CH-54 rotorcraft as well. To maintain close control of blade manufacture, Erickson built a composite manufacturing facility from scratch in 2015. After thousands of hours of design, testing, and analysis by Erickson's engineers and partners, the new composite main rotor blades are now approved by the FAA for the S-64E with an initial life that will increase as fatigue testing continues. Certification for the CH-54A is expected to follow quickly in the coming weeks, and certification for the S-64F and CH-54B is expected this summer.

Morris Knolls' David Turner (138) beat West Essex's second-seeded Darren Jones in the third-fourth consolation bout at Region 2, 3-2, and will enter Boardwalk Hall as a sleeper to make some noise. Turner won his first match but lost his second by getting pinned by Jones in 59 seconds. But in the wrestlebacks, he beat Lenape Valley's Eric Falleni in overtime, 10-8, and Antonio Cuffari of Cedar Grove, 13-4, in the consolation semifinals to qualify for the states.


  "David put forth an unbelievable effort to wrestle back for third," coach Joe Barchetto said. "David was pinned in the first period by Darren Jones Friday night and it just looked like the atmosphere got to him. We talked that night about just letting go and wrestle, and boy did he respond Saturday with one of the toughest roads back to third I have seen in a while. You could see the confidence in David grow and it was like a landslide. He just kept a relentless pace scoring points to punch his ticket to AC. Most kids knowing they were going to wrestle a kid that just pinned them the night before for third place already qualifying for states would have been content, but not David. You could now visibly see the confidence coming out of him and that made him extremely dangerous. To pull out that last match the way he did against a kid who is slated to place in the state tournament should give him the confidence to go down to AC and not just be happy but make some noise and put a stamp on his season."


  Montville had four wrestlers reach Atlantic City out of Region 2 in Mike Conrad (first at 182), Noah Fox (second at 170), Aaron Kurzer (second at 113), and Brandon Teresa (third at 152).


  "My three senior captains Mike Conrad, Noah Fox and Brandon Teresa did a tremendous job this season bringing the team together and making sure everyone was doing their part to make their teammates better," coach John Krip said. "They work so hard for one another that it feels they are more like brothers than teammates. One brotherhood that can’t be overlooked is how Mike Conrad has looked after Aaron Kurzer all year. He is always in his corner at matches and tournaments and that support makes you work harder. You don’t want to let your brothers down, so you do whatever it takes to get the edge.


  "Aaron Kurzer has been improving all season. Coming into this season he was a solid wrestler placing in tournaments advancing to the regions but that wasn’t good enough for him. He put a lot of work in the off season and was determined to improve on his successful freshman season. The hard work paid off. He won his first high school tournament at the start of the season has improved drastically as the year went on by placing in the top three of the Morris county tournament and finishing off the season as a District 6 champion. He has 32 wins on the season and isn’t finished yet. He is excited about the opportunity to wrestle in AC but he wants to earn himself a spot on the podium when it’s all over Saturday. His work ethic is tremendous and it not only shows in his performance it reflects on the guys he practices with."


  Boonton saw two wrestlers qualify for the state tournament out of Region 2 in Jason Smith (third at 145) and Joe Fongaro (fourth at 126).


  "Both Joe and Jason had excellent tournaments," coach Dave Hughen said. "Joe wrestled in a very tough and experienced weight class. I felt that he came out aggressive and was prepared for his matches. He came up with big points when he needed them most in critical spots throughout the tournament. It’s amazing that as a sophomore he wrestles like a veteran out there and with confidence. I am really excited about what next weekend will bring for him. It’s nice that he has been there and knows how to adjust to the pressures of Atlantic City.


  "Jason has really been on fire this postseason. He has wrestled his style and has used his excellent conditioning to put constant pressure on his opponents. He was 1-1 late in the semis before falling just short of the finals (losing 5-1 to Paramus Catholic's Nicholas Franco) but bounced back in a big way to grab two victories on his way to third place. It was big for him as this will be his first trip to Atlantic City and it will help that his finish will get him seeded a bit higher. As a sophomore, Jason shows outstanding composure on the mat and you are going to get his best for six minutes.


  "I could not be more happy for both guys. They are outstanding team leaders and work so hard to prepare to compete at such a high level. More importantly, they do things the right way and represent our program in the highest manner."

BOSTON -- The state Department of Public Health Monday night announced a presumptive positive case of COVID-19, known as the coronavirus, contracted by a woman who recently traveled to Italy.


  The woman, in her 20s and who lives in Norfolk County, had recently traveled to Italy with a school group, according to a statement issued Monday night by the state agency.


  The woman was recovering at home. According to the agency, the woman's test results came back positive Monday evening.


  Specimens will be sent to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and, if confirmed, it would be the second confirmed positive coronavirus case in Massachusetts since the outbreak started in the United States in January. In its statement, the agency said the risk to COVID-19 remains low in the Bay State.


  "We are grateful this individual is recovering," said Public Health Commissioner Monica Bharel. "We understand the concern this new virus is causing, and our state's ability to quickly test for the virus is a positive development."


  As of last week, 608 people have been subject to self-quarantine in Massachusetts because of the coronavirus. Of those, 377 people have completed monitoring and are no longer quarantined, while 231 are currently quarantined.


  Gov. Charlie Baker and state health officials on Monday reiterated that the risk for the virus remains low in Massachusetts.


  "Part of the reason we're here today is to let you know that we are thinking ahead and will continue to do everything we need to do to keep Massachusetts safe and prepared," Baker said. "Reading some of the news and the headlines can be stressful and everyone should do their part to stay healthy and prevent the spreading of germs."


  Secretary of Health and Human Services Marylou Sudders urged that all residents should take steps to fight off the illness, including hand washing, cleaning frequently-touched surfaces and staying home when feeling ill.


  Material from the State House News Service was used in this report


  On Friday, the state public health laboratory received a green light from federal officials to perform diagnostic testing for the virus.


  "This is good news for Massachusetts, as testing at the state public health lab enables us to speed up obtaining the test results and expediates ongoing testing of any confirmed cases that are recovered," Bharel said.


  Bharel said the state lab has an adequate supply of test kits from the CDC, and the anticipated turnaround time for test results here is 24 hours, depending on volume.


  A midyear spending bill state lawmakers sent to Baker on Monday included $95,000 for coronavirus-related expenses at the state lab. Sudders said that money will pay for overtime for staff to conduct testing.


  "It's one of the few times I can say to an agency, whatever resources she needs, she is to spend it," Sudders said, referring to Bharel. "And we will work with our colleagues in the Legislature to ensure that the Department of Public Health has the money in the state lab to do the work that it needs to do."


  Bharel said the department is providing hospitals and health systems with clinical and infection control guidance, and monitoring supply chains for personal protective equipment like gloves and face masks.

Wisconsin’s D’Mitrik Trice went 5-for-6 from 3-point range and seemingly answered every one of Michigan’s second-half runs with a momentum-stopping 3. Ohio State’s Duane Washington Jr. finished 5-for-7 from deep and made two second-half 3s when Michigan was making a push.


  “He played well, shot the ball extremely well,” Howard said of Washington. “We just didn’t give him enough resistance that he needed to make everything hard for him.”


  Freshman wing Franz Wagner didn’t feel the quality of looks Ohio State got was much different than Wisconsin. Aside from “two bad shots that just went in,” Wagner said the Buckeyes, and Washington in particular, got too many open shots.


  As frustrating as the past two games have been, Wagner couldn’t pinpoint just one thing the Wolverines need to do differently to fix the issue.


  “Everything has got to be better,” Wagner said. “Everybody has to be closer to their man, more in his face and more ready to close out to the shooter.


  “Last game they (Wisconsin) got a lot of open shots because we just didn’t talk, and our minds weren’t where they were supposed to be. Mostly Washington’s shots I think is where we messed up defensively and him coming off screens and he’s been making us pay for that. We weren’t ready, we weren’t communicating and not everybody was aware of that what was happening on the floor. If I had an explanation for this, I wouldn’t let that happen. Nobody would on the team.”


  Brooks said the team didn’t do a good job taking away early looks and preventing Wisconsin and Ohio State from getting comfortable. While the Buckeyes made some tough shots, including a couple banked-in 3-pointers, Brooks added the Wolverines could’ve limited most of their long-range attempts.


  “We’ve got to communicate better,” Brooks said. “A lot of the open 3s were off switches or not being in the right position, so just talking your position and knowing where you’re supposed to be (needs to happen). Coach always talks about talk your position, so you can talk your way into it.”


  Michigan’s own 3-point shooting hasn’t helped matters either. The Wolverines shot 26.9 percent (7-for-26) from 3-point range against the Buckeyes, marking the fourth straight game they’ve shot 30 percent or worse from beyond the arc.


  Outside of Wagner, who went 4-for-8 from deep, nobody was able to dial it in from distance.


  Junior forward Isaiah Livers and Brooks, the team’s top two 3-point shooters, finished a combined 3-for-12. That dropped their shooting number down to 22.2 percent (6-for-27) from 3-point range over the past four games.


  “They were open shots,” Howard said. “Isaiah had some really clear, open shots that unfortunately didn’t go in. ... I’ve trusted all season long. Same song and dance.”


  And even though Howard has carried a similar tune in his last two postgame pressers, it hasn’t shaken the Wolverines’ belief in their abilities.


  “The confidence is at same point it was during the five-game win streak (last month) because we know we can do it,” Wagner said. “We know we have everything we need. It’s just a matter of if we’re able to show what we can do. I’m very confident about my team and about everybody in the locker room. I’m sure everybody feels the same way.”

Power forward Krystal Freeman had game highs of 21 points and 10 rebounds, and Tulane came up with a gutsy performance on Senior Night to edge Temple 53-50 Monday in the season's final regular-season game.


  The Green Wave (13-16, 8-8) ended a seven-game losing streak in salvaging the American Athletic Conference season with a .500 mark. Tulane came into the game tied with Temple (15-14, 7-9) and Wichita State for fifth place in the conference.


  “Our two seniors (guard Kayla Manuirirangi and forward Maddison Wells) mean so much to this program, and to get the win for them means so much for them and us,” said Freeman, who had 13 points and seven rebounds in the second half. “We were down 11 at halftime, and we said we'd just chip away.”


  The Green Wave overcame a 35-24 halftime lead by taking off its press and settling back into a tough half-court zone defense. Temple missed its first 10 shots of the third quarter and shot 2-of-18 in the quarter.


  Also key was the play of freshman point guard Salma Bates, who ran the offense well and played sticky defense against guard Marissa Mackins. Mackins scored 10 points but shot just 1-of-7 in the fourth.


  The lead changed hands seven times in the fourth quarter. Guard Arsula sank two free throws with a minute, 45 seconds left that gave Tulane a 51-50 lead. Freeman, who scored six of the Wave's 12 fourth-quarter points, hit a turnaround 10-foot jump shot with 14.2 seconds left that pushed the lead to three.


  Temple guard Lena Niang missed a 3-point try from the corner under duress as the shot clock expired.


  “We knew their bigs were in foul trouble, so we just attacked,” Freeman said.


  Tulane had a miserable start to the game and fell into a deep hole. On its first seven possessions, the Green Wave missed three shots, had three turnovers and an offensive foul. All of that led to a 9-0 lead by Temple, which attacked the basket.


  Temple led 18-7 at the end of the first quarter by shooting 8-of-16. When the Owls weren't scoring on drives and post-ups, they got the ball in the basket on put-backs. Tulane, meanwhile, shot 3-of-16, obviously struggled defending, and Coach Lisa Stockton substituted feverishly to find some combination that would work and not let the game get out of hand.


  The Wave had a much better second quarter, matching the Owls' 17 points but did not cut into the lead, which was 35-24 at halftime. Central to the Temple lead was a 22-4 advantage in points in the lane.

  “Reinig, an experienced skier, tumbled and struck a tree, breaking several ribs and his right leg,” the afternoon newspaper reported. “First aid was administered by the ski patrol and he was taken immediately to St. John’s Hospital, where he was listed critical last night, but improving today.”

His last bow      While the social media keeps us updated about the glitzy life of the A list stars, there's a whole section of the industry about which the common masses remain unaware of. The actors who play bit roles too are as much passionate about acting as their better-known peers. Their passion perhaps is more deep- rooted, as it's purely the gambler's instinct which propels them to try out their luck every day in the hope of striking it rich. All they are looking for is one good camera angle, one punch dialogue, one quirk or mannerism that'll turn them into household names.      Sudheer (Sanjay Mishra) is one such character actor who has acted in bit roles all his life but never made it to the big league. He has retired after completing 499 films. Circumstances force him to come out of retirement in order to complete the 500 mark and the chance to finally make a name for himself after all these years. He's largely based on the late Viju Khote. The film is dedicated to Khote, who also appears in it as himself. Viju's chief claim to fame was playing Kaalia in Sholay. His dialogue, "Sardar maine aapka namak khaya hai," is still remembered today even after all this while. Likewise, Sanjay Mishra's character Sudheer too has a famous dialogue, "Enjoy life, choice hi kya hai," after which he's shot by his boss in a film. This dialogue is his calling card of sorts, remembered by fans decades down the line. There is a scene where Sudheer and other character actors like Birbal, Manmauji and Viju Khote are celebrating Manmauji's success of being mentioned in the Limca Book Of Records for playing bald characters the maximum number of times. The scene has the veterans reminiscing about old times. There is much laughter in the scene, much camaraderie. There is also lament about not getting their due, also of not getting paid on time. One can say that the scene is the film in microsome.      Sudheer has been luckier than most. He has a house of his own, as also a small shop on whose rent he survives. He has a loving daughter, a granddaughter who dotes on him and a son-in-law who cares about him. The daughter is a bit angry as she feels he has neglected his family by giving preference to his passion. She wants him to let go of his romance of the limelight and rest and relax, spend time with his loved ones. He finds a kinship of sorts with a young neighbour (Isha Talwar), an actress who is trying to find her feet in the new media. They become friends because their struggles seem the same, despite their age difference. He's shown to have a running rivalry with Avtar Gill, who is said to have cemented his place because he's part of the Bhatt camp. Gill is in full flow here as a hugely territorial actor. Deepak Dobriyal acts as a casting agent who has his philosophy sorted out. He likes to do the best for his actors by and large, though is as cunning as they come nonetheless. He too is fabulous, as always, to say the least.      The film dives deep into the lives of bit players, acquainting us with the not so glamorous side of the film world. We see popular actors reduced to doing infomercials. But their love for their craft still remains strong despite all the hardships. It's not just a means to secure a living that drives them. It's rather the rush of putting on the greasepaint and facing the arc lights that keep them motivated.      Sudheer is shown to have a drinking problem. He also fails to connect with his family. There's latent frustration within him that he has kept a lid on. He has learnt to live with his regret. All that comes across through Sanjay Mishra's quicksilver expressions. The triumph for both Sudheer and Mishra comes in the film's climax where the principal of his granddaughter's school asks him to entertain the audience as the chief guest, a popular star, has been stuck in traffic. Sudheer acts out his most popular scenes, creating a '70s potboiler live on stage for the audience and feeling justified in his choice of career as they collectively recall his lines. It's such a fluid scene that you never make out where the actor ends and the character begins. The film is an ode to all the mostly-famous people associated with our film industry. Watch it for its tragi-comic story, as also for Sanjay Mishra's superlative acting.

WATERLOO -- A spending plan boosting city property taxes by more than 8.5% remains alive this week.


  Waterloo City Council members voted 6-1 Monday to approve a "maximum levy" for the fiscal year 2020-21 budget, which could boost property taxes by $2.8 million and bump the property tax rate from $17.55 to $18.88 per $1,000.


  Mayor Quentin Hart said he's been called some "flowery names" based on the size of the potential tax increase. But he noted the actual tax hike, if any, won't be approved until the second budget hearing scheduled for March 19.


  Chief Financial Officer Michelle Weidner said this week's council action simply sets a ceiling.

MANKATO, Minn. (KEYC) - The Mankato Public School Board heard an update on the two-tiered bus system Mankato.Plans for the two-tiered system are moving forward and Monday’s meeting addressed updates on the system that’s set to take effect next school year.With recent reports of bullying and violence on school buses, community members addressed their concerns for students’ safety to which the school district says the two-tiered system will address.“When we talked with other school districts that have gone to this two-tier it does help create a more calm environment because there are fewer transfers, we have peer groups on the buses and that does seem to be one of the positive advantages of going to a tiered approach,” says Director of Business Services Tom Sager.About 60 percent of the bus routes have been established so far and the plan going forward is to still pick up elementary- aged students first and then grades six through 12 next.“We’re going to be going to the same neighborhoods we do now. I mean the school district boundaries have remained the same, so it’s just a matter of not such much changing the actual route, but in so much as who’s going to be one the bus at which time,” says Sager.Feedback from the community given to the school district shows parents are concerned about the supervision of their children after school before they’re bused home, and how schools will handle this.“So we as a school district, and as a school in general, will provide supervision, staff availability for students at that time. So they play on the playground or they might see some of their teachers, finish their homework or maybe just hang out in the cafeteria, but we’ll have adults present,” says Sager.Still in the planning stages are inclement weather protocols, student drop-off time and necessary staffing adjustments for after-school supervision.The next update on the two-tiered system is planned for later this spring.Copyright 2020 KEYC.

During the run Junda, scored his 1,000th varsity point with 1:12 left in the contest on a steal and a layup. He finished with 1,0003. The game was stopped to acknowledge the honor. He is the fifth Hanover Park player in the last five years to reach the milestone.


  When it was over the Dodgers were breathing a sigh of relief while the Hornets although disappointed with the loss, were happy with their fourth- quarter exploits.


  “We came out with a win,’’ Madison coach Joe Reel said. “Obviously it wasn’t pretty. Hats off to those (Hanover Park) kids…. I was glad that Kyle Junda got his 1,000th point today. It was a very weird time.’’


  The Hornets agreed but their ability to come close in the end took the sting off of losing a little bit.


  “A loss is never good but just to see how we responded is positive,’’ Junda said. “If we would have played a couple more minutes, who knows what would have happened.’’


  Despite Hanover Park’s pressure defense and uptempo style the Dodgers controlled the tempo of the game for three and a half quarters. A. J. Gupta drew a couple of charges on Junda on drives to the basket to get the Hornets scorer in early foul trouble. Meanwhile Brendan Mariani and Paul Saurer were strong in the paint and got plenty to rebounds and putbacks to help Madison build a lead.


  “Our whole game was taking charges and showing the toughness that we have,’’ Mariani said. “Their idea was to play and press the whole game. We moved the ball well and got up and down and played our game.’’


  Madison started the game on a 10-2 run. Sauer had eight points early to help the Dodgers build a 28-16 first quarter lead. The Hornets and Junda worked their way back into the game. The Hanover Park guard focused on perimeter play instead and had 12 second-quarter points to help cut into the Madison lead. The Dodgers had a 46-39 advantage at the half.


  The Hornets cut the deficit to 48-44 but then it was the Dodgers turn to get hot. They went on a 21-4 third quarter run that included an offensive burst from Cy Bowen. The junior forward came off the bench to score eight of his points including back-to-back threes to give Madison a 69-48 advantage late in the third quarter.


  Madison had a lead as large as 22 points inside of four minutes, but Hanover Park would not give up without a final burst.


  “We have these periods where we look like we have no idea what we are doing. Then we have these flashes of unstoppable brilliance,’’ Hanover Park coach Todd Hartman said. “We’ve had a lot of bad luck and injury and illness and every day at practice the kids show up and work hard. I never once had to tell them to get going and work hard. They show up for me and they show up for each other.’’


  Hanover Park uses a lot of players to keep up their pressure defense and play an uptempo style that can wear down opponents late in the game. Madison suffered from a combination of fatigue, inexperience and foul trouble. Gupta, who anchors the defense with 36 drawn charges, would eventually foul out and Saurer was sent to the bench in spurts as the Hornets started working their way back into the game.

Set in the present day, the mood of ‘Kaamyaab’ is 90s – big wigs, flashy clothes, caricature-ish characters, a lot of ‘buddy time’ on sets and some serious loud theatrics. The film’s music, by Rachita Arora, balances the otherwise blaring depiction of the industry with its soothing numbers and barely-there background scores; a perfect fit. Sure, this drama has used Sanjay Mishra’s fall from grace and his subsequent redemption (or the lack of it) as a metaphor for the good-old saying – it’s never too late to chase your dreams – but not once do the writers get preachy about it. The writers deserve brownie points for some witty writing, and keeping things real, too.

These are hugely important recommendations. It is of course highly unlikely that Xi's repressive rule, grandiose ambitions and pervasive censorship will allow any such transparency or investigation. But that fog of repression and lies is where the spotlight belongs: China's refusal to come clean on the origin of this virus. Or -- if China's authorities truly don't know -- China's refusal to allow access to expert investigators whose agenda is scientific truth, not Communist Party propaganda.

The same perimeter defense that had been a strength of Michigan’s throughout the season once again showed cracks in its foundation and drew Howard’s ire.


  “It’s very disappointing,” Howard said shortly after Michigan dropped its second straight contest with Sunday’s 77-63 loss at Value City Arena.


  Over the first 27 games of the season, Michigan (18-11, 9-9 Big Ten) didn’t allow a single team to make more than nine 3-pointers as opponents averaged 5.1 made 3s on 30.3 percent shooting.


  During that same span, the Wolverines had allowed the fewest made deep balls during Big Ten play and ranked among the nation’s best in limiting 3-point attempts.


  That changed against the conference’s top two 3-point shooting teams. The streak came to an end last Thursday when Wisconsin reached the double-digit mark with 11 3-pointers. The list doubled when Ohio State repeated the feat just three days later.


  The Badgers and Buckeyes combined to make more 3s (22) than the Wolverines allowed during their recent five-game win streak (21).


  “You can’t win the game that way,” junior guard Eli Brooks said matter-of- factly.


  After the Badgers shot 47.8 percent (11-for-23) from deep, Howard used words like poor, lazy and disappointing to describe his team’s defensive effort. And after the Buckeyes followed with a 52.4-percent clip (11-for-21), Howard was just as displeased.


  Same words. Same topic. Same difference in the game.


  “We have to do a better job of having a certain level of focus and making sure that we close all the way to those 3-point shooters,” Howard said. “I’d rather see a lot of these stickers (3-point shooters) be able to shoot the ball with no air space with a hand-ball contest. But we will improve in that area. I trust we will.”


  For second straight contest, it was a trio of players who combined to deal the bulk of the long-range damage against Michigan.


  But it was a guard who got hot and couldn’t be cooled off from beyond the arc that ultimately tipped the scales.
