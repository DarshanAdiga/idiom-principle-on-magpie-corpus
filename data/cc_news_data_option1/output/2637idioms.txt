It's not been uncommon in recent years to find instances where Berkshire Hathaway has had more than 80% of its invested assets in three sectors, or where close to two-thirds of the company's invested assets are tied up in four or five companies. But given the unprecedented volatility that's occurred in 2020 due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, these concentrations have really been thrown out of whack.

Meanwhile, half of businesses do not expect to reach break even until the end of next year.
 An open letter from hospitality bosses to the Government has called for tax bills to be deferred and for VAT to be slashed to give the sector a boost.
 The bosses said with the right support from ministers they could help create a wave of new jobs in the coming years.
 They wrote: 'In the decade that followed the financial crisis hospitality consistently created around one in six new jobs thanks in part to the VAT cuts and investment in youth employment and training introduced in the immediate aftermath. We can do so again.'
 It came as a group of former advisers to five Tory prime ministers and chancellors called for Mr Sunak to invest £30 billion in struggling firms.
 Economic advisers to George Osborne, David Cameron, Theresa May, Philip Hammond and Sajid Javid penned a new report for the Onward think tank.
 The former advisers suggested the money should be invested directly into high- growth companies through the British Business Bank, British Growth Fund and British Patient Capital to ensure firms can access capital.
 Meanwhile, union leaders have warned there could be a return to 1980s levels of mass unemployment unless Mr Sunak takes urgent action to support workers and businesses.
 Leaders of the TUC, Unite, Unison, GMB and Usdaw warned there is only a 'very short window' to prevent hundreds of thousands of workers from losing their jobs.

Russ Matulich, RTI's CEO, said, "JGA North's on-time completion is extraordinary. The subsea cable experts on the ground and at sea overcame obstacle-after-obstacle by closely collaborating - an art that has become a standard practice over many years. It resulted in JGA North's remarkable on- time, and under budget, completion. This exceptional outcome - against all odds - confirms what the industry already knows: money doesn't get cables built, relationships do. RTI is extremely grateful to our many friends that rose up to the challenge, especially the engineering teams, marine experts, and other subject matter experts who are often overlooked. JGA North's success is yours!"

MILAN, July 6 (Reuters) - Unbeaten since the restart of the season and with their players finally performing to their potential, AC Milan seem to be on the right track -- yet the coach who has sparked the revival still faces an uncertain future.
 Stefano Pioli has carried on against a backdrop of reports, which have carried on for months, that he will be ditched at the end of the season and replaced by Ralf Rangnick, who as sporting director has masterminded RB Leipzig's rise in Germany.
 Milan, who dropped to 14th in Serie A at one point this season, have lost only twice since the start of the year and climbed to sixth, putting them on course for a Europa League place which has become their target for this season.
 They impressively thumped second-placed Lazio 3-0 away on Saturday and on Tuesday hope to throw a spanner in the works of leaders Juventus, who are seven points clear of the field with eight matches to play.
 Lazio, meanwhile, visit relegation-threatened Lecce, also on Tuesday.
 Pioli, a veteran of the Serie A coaching circuit, has been remarkably philosophical about the situation, insisting that uncertainty is part of his profession.
 "I don't know what the future holds for the squad and for me but we're working very well as we have done all season," said Pioli, appointed in October as a replacement for Marco Giampaolo.
 The 54-year-old has helped talented but inconsistent players such as Hakan Calhanoglu, Lucas Paqueta and Ante Rebic find a new lease of life this season and has also been helped by the arrival of 38-year-old Zlatan Ibrahimovic as a reinforcement.
 "They players have been working very well in training -- this is a very responsible squad, aware of the importance of the shirt they wear," said Pioli.
 "The players are continuing to give 110 percent, even those who signed contracts to the end of the season and probably won't remain here after that. They are determined to prove they are still strong players at this level and to give their best for Milan.
 "We think we deserve a better positing in the table -- we can't qualify for the Champions League any more but at least we have to get the club back in a European competition." (Writing by Brian Homewood Editing by Christian Radnedge)
