A battery conviction has landed a 39-year-old Montegut man behind bars for the rest of his life.
 Following a hearing Jan. 15, District Judge David Arceneaux sentenced Donald Dardar Jr. to life in prison without parole, probation or suspension of sentence after ruling him as a habitual offender.
 Dardar has a lengthy rap sheet that includes convictions for sex crimes and crimes of violence, prosecutors said. He was convicted of burglary in 1999 and three counts of carnal knowledge of a juvenile in 2001. Dardar was also convicted of simple burglary in 2004 and contributing to the delinquency of a juvenile. He was most recently convicted of aggravated second-degree battery on Aug. 16, 2018.
 Prosecutors charged him as a habitual offender on Oct. 4, 2018.
 The judge had to sentence him under the habitual-offender law as it was in 2015 when he committed the battery, prosecutors said.
 Dardar's battery conviction stemmed from a fight that left another man severely injured, authorities said. After getting jealous of the victim for talking to his now late wife at a bar, the defendant followed him home and started a fight. Dardar grabbed a chunk of concrete out of the back of a truck and threw it at the victim, striking him in the head. The victim suffered severe brain trauma that left him unable to walk and limited the function of his arms.
 The victim, in his early 30s, will likely live out the rest of his life in a nursing home, Assistant District Attorney Amanda Mustin said.
 "I don't get any enjoyment out of Donald Dardar spending the rest of his life in prison," said Mustin, who prosecuted the case. "I am very aware that he has young children who now have lost both their mother and father. My heart aches for those children. However, my heart also aches for (the victim) and his two young daughters."
 Although Dardar was sentenced to life, the victim has also been given a life sentence, Mustin said.
 "The night that Donald Dardar chose to follow him home and launch a concrete chunk into his skull, Donald Dardar gave him a life sentence," she said. "He will miss all of his daughters' life events. He will never walk his daughters down the aisle at their weddings. He will never hold or play with his children again nor ever hold or play with any future grandchildren. He is imprisoned in his own body, all because of Donald Dardar. I am not joyous that Donald Dardar will live the rest of his days in prison, but, in light of what he did to (the victim), justice is served by him doing so."
 Dardar's court-appointed attorney, Dustin Pellegrin, could not be reached for comment.

After spending the fall learning about Louisiana's coast, four environmental science classrooms in Terrebonne will start constructing community adaptation projects around the high schools.
 The students developed project proposals that were ranked before selecting one from each class that stayed within the $10,000 budget.
 The program, called Project Resilience, is the first of its kind, enabled by the local South Louisiana Wetlands Discovery Center in Houma and the Colorado- based University Corporation for Atmospheric Research.
 For H.L. Bourgeois and South Terrebonne high schools, that means adding more water-bottle-refilling stations to cut down on single-use plastic water bottles, said Jonathan Foret, the Discovery Center's director.
 This will build on a project started by students who worked with another environmental agency, the Thibodaux-based Barataria-Terrebonne National Estuary Program.
 South Terrebonne students will also complete a beautification project by creating an outdoor classroom space in its quad filled with native plants that will also hold water.
 At Ellender High in Houma, students will develop a garden to collect rain water from the building, limiting flooding and try to give new life to an old deck that's fallen into disrepair by adding an overhead cover.
 Terrebonne High students will work with engineers to develop a way to divert water from a portion of the school bus turnaround area that fills up during heavy rain.
 Students from all four classes will come together April 7 for a youth summit to present and discuss their projects.
 The teachers and students have been excited throughout the process, said Terrebonne Parish STEM Curriculum Specialist Nathan Cotten and Becca Hatheway with the research organization.
 "The exciting part is it's something new, it's something different, it's authentic. They love that," Cotten said. "It's something to better their school and their community. ... It's not just one and done for this year they'll be a letter to come back and see it in the future."

The local chapter of Girls on the Run is in desperate need of help from the community, not necessarily with money, but with time.
 The program needs volunteer coaches to be able to sustain itself in its ninth year.
 Girls on the Run is an international program that seeks to inspire girls in third through eighth grade to be joyful, healthy and confident. The 10-week program teaches critical life skills, encourages personal development and fosters physical activity, team building and community service.
 Girls on the Run Bayou Region serves girls at multiple school sites in Terrebonne, Lafourche, St. Mary and St. Charles parishes.
 Local Director Ashlee Laiche said the program leads up to participating in a 5K run, not to compete against each other but to support each other.
 "All the girls in the program and their running buddies run in a celebration 5K as the culmination of the season," Laiche said.
 Organizers do not keep track of times or reward medals for the fastest runners. However, they will have clocks at the end of the race for individuals who want to personally keep track of times for goal-setting purposes.
 "We focus on inspiring them to be joyful and healthy in a fun, experience- based curriculum," Laiche said. "Every practice starts with a lesson, some value or skill that they can use for the rest of their life. Then they do physical activity to encourage a healthy lifestyle and counteract negative body image."
 Emma Thibodeaux, a fourth-grader at Mulberry Elementary in Houma, said the program has helped her self-esteem.
 "One of the things I like most about Girls on the Run is that it builds self- respect by teaching us to believe in ourselves and stand up for ourselves," she said. "We support and encourage each other to be the best version of ourselves that we can be."
 But all of that is in danger of going away without boots -- or running shoes -- on the ground.
 Volunteer coaches facilitate lessons to small teams of girls who typically meet after-school twice a week for 75-90 minutes. Individuals must be at least 18 years old to serve as an assistant coach or at least 21 years old to serve as a head coach. Volunteer coaches do not need to be runners but must complete a background check and participate in on-line and in-person training.
 Girls on the Run Bayou Region's spring coach registration is now open. For information or to sign up to coach, visit gotrbayouregion.org/coach or call 647-5472.

BATON ROUGE -- Gov. John Bel Edwards said he wants to push teacher pay to the regional average over the next four years, but education groups aligned with the governor say it needs to happen much quicker.
 Leaders of the Louisiana Association of Educators and the Louisiana Federation of Teachers, longtime allies of Edwards, as well as the Associated Professional Educators of Louisiana say teacher pay needs to rise faster than the governor's timetable.
 "We're confident we'll be able to work with Gov. Edwards and the Legislature to secure additional pay increases this year for all Louisiana teachers and school support professionals so they make on par with their colleagues in surrounding states," Tia Mills, president of the Louisiana Association of Educators, said in a statement.
 Federation President Larry Carter made the same point. "It is important to be competitive now, not later," he said.
 Teachers in Louisiana trail the regional average by $1,819, according to the latest tally.
 Pay here averaged $50,359 per year compared with $52,178 in the 16 states monitored by the Southern Regional Education Board.
 Louisiana ranks 11th. Average pay nationally is $60,642.
 The figures are from 2017-18, the latest available for comparison purposes.
 Edwards pushed through a $1,000 teacher pay raise last year, the first of its kind in a decade.
 However, average pay in other states has risen, too.
 Texas boosted teacher salaries by up to $9,000.
 Lawmakers in Florida boosted pay by $2,000 and Georgia raised salaries by $3,000, according to the regional board.
 The governor, who has long said it would take several years to reach the regional average, reiterated that view in his inaugural address on Jan. 13.
 "So over the next four years, we're going to continue increasing classroom funding and give educators additional pay raises that will get them at least to the Southern regional average," he said.
 Some allies of the governor said privately they were surprised by the timetable and that 2020 should be the target.
 Others said faster action is needed so that Louisiana is no longer among the lowest in the nation for teacher pay.
 "We feel the same as everyone else," Carter said. "We want it to happen more quickly than four years."
 The state has about 50,000 public school teachers.
 Last year's increase was seen in part as a way to answer the sort of teacher pay complaints that sparked walkouts in other states in 2018, including Oklahoma, West Virginia and Arizona.
 A 2018 survey among Federation members showed that 60% favored a statewide walkout or strike in order to get a "significant" pay raise.
 How much was not specified.
 "We got at least a bump, but it certainly wasn't enough," Carter said of the $1,000 increase.
 The 2020 regular session begins March 9 and ends June 1.
 Edwards will spell out his budget priorities ahead of the opening of the session.
 Keith Courville, executive director of the Associated Professional Educators of Louisiana, noted his group backed $3,000 teacher pay raises last year.
 "We should have reached the average last year," Courville said. "We had the money to do more than a $1,000 raise."
 During a meeting last year of a key education advisory board, Courville made a motion for $3,000 teacher pay increases.
 Representatives of the two teachers unions on the same panel then abstained amid complaints that the proposal was unrealistic.
 "Teachers need the money," Courville said last week. "They needed it yesterday."
 Any teacher pay raise depends in part on the state's financial outlook.
 Also, Edwards has said repeatedly that early childhood education is his top education priority in the second term for new state dollars.
 Higher education advocates and others will be pressing for funding hikes as well, especially after state aid for colleges and universities was sliced by nearly 50% over 10 years.
 Another unknown is how well Democrat Edwards works with a GOP-controlled Legislature, which has more Republican members than it did during the governors' first term.
 The Senate has a new president -- Sen. Page Cortez, R-Lafayette -- and the House has a new speaker -- Rep. Clay Schexnayder, R-Gonzales.
 Sen. Cleo Fields, D-Baton Rouge, will be chairman of the Senate Education Committee. The new chair of the House Education Committee has not been announced.
 Carter said teacher pay raises should be a priority.
 "One of the things we certainly talked about in the past year is that we believe that to be competitive in our state we have to pay teachers and school employees at least what the Southern average is," he said.
 "Too many of our young men and women are leaving this state to get that pay," Carter said.

The Southeastern Community College men's basketball team got off to a great start to the season, winning eight of its first 10 games.
 Yet there still was something missing for the Blackhawks, the elements of toughness and grittiness, someone willing to get down and dirty, do the hard work in the paint.
 Enter Aaris Bonds, a 6-foot-6 sophomore forward who comes from the tough streets of Denver, Colorado and has fought his own battles every step of the way.
 Aaris, who sat out the first 10 games of the season while waiting for his redshirt to be cleared after sustaining a shoulder injury at Lamar Community College last season that limited him to two games and required season-ending surgery, has been a force to be reckoned with since joining the lineup.
 Aaris is averaging 12.5 points, 8.2 rebounds and 1.1 blocks in the 10 games since Bonds joined the lineup, going 8-2, including a 73-69 victory over fourth-ranked Indian Hills last week.
 Bonds brings the elements of toughness and grittiness that have taken the 22nd-ranked Blackhawks to a whole new level.
 "It's all about being tough. If you've seen a game you know we play small. Size doesn't really matter. It's all about being tough and trying to go through them," Bonds said. "It was a big team win. It showed that we can bounce back from anything. It showed that we played together for 40 minutes and that's really what it takes. We have to believe in each other and we got the job done. Clearly rankings don't matter. Numbers don't mean anything. We could be No. 22 and you could be No. 4, but if you come into this house you're going to lose."
 "Aaris brings a lot of energy and that's what we need," SCC coach Lorenzo Watkins said. "He does all the tough-man stuff, all the dirty work line rebounding, defending and guarding bigger guys. He's tough to guard one-on- one. he is so quick down in the post and he can face up and shoot the 12 to 15-footer. That's part of his game we haven't really seen yet is his ability to shoot from the outside."
 Bonds, who grew up on the rugged streets of Denver, avoided all the traps and pratfalls that caught many of his friends and neighbors. Instead, Bonds stuck to athletics and academics as his means to escape.
 A lot of Bonds' toughness and grittiness comes from his days as a wide receiver and free safety for the Montbello High School football team. As tough and athletic as the day is long, Bonds develop a reputation for being a tough, hard-nosed player on the gridiron, traits that carried over to the basketball courts when he started playing that game in earnest in high school.
 "I was a football player. I didn't start playing basketball until high school. I just kept with it," Bonds said. "Growing up out there was tough. I really didn't do much. It was either sports or it was home. It was tough. You don't want to be in the streets too much. There are some pretty bad areas out there. We try to stay away from those areas. I took care of my little brother and sister and that was really it."
 Bonds suffered an injury in the season game at Lamar Community College last season and applied for a redshirt year. He transferred to SCC, but didn't find out about his redshirt eligibility until the end of November. So he had to sit and watch his teammates play the first month of the season without him. That, for Bonds, was tough.
 "It was a long story. I got injured. I couldn't get my redshirt year back at Lamar Community College. Coach Wolf had called me. They watched my film and they said that they could help me get my redshirt year back. I came and I sat for 13 games. I cheered my team on. I never missed a game. I sat for 13, 14 games. I was just waiting for them to get it and they got it. I'm thankful for that. I'm really thankful," Bonds said. "It was really tough just watching, but still practicing and making sure I stayed in condition. But just watching the game? Man, that was tough for me, especially the ones that we let slip away. I felt like I could have been in there and helped."
 "I told him that regardless of what happens, you have to go to class and do all the other stuff away from basketball," Watkins said. "I am very proud of him for fighting through some tough adversity."
 Bonds has played a vital role for the Blackhawks. A tenacious player in the post, he often draw double and sometimes triple-teams, leaving teammates open for shots from the perimeter. And when defenses loosen up to focus on the 3-point shooters, that leaves Bonds room to weave his magic in the paint.
 "It's great. I love my teammates. I wouldn't trade them for anyone," Bonds said. "It's a great feeling, especially when they get hot. They go into a zone. I told them at halftime we need some shooters, somebody to start knocking down shots. The whole team just started making shots."
 Bonds has found a new home at SCC. Bonds and his teammates have formed friendships, learned to trust in one another, learned to work together toward a common goal. He is loving every minute of being in a small community, where he feels like part of a family.
 "With this team it's a movie. With this team something new is going to happen. I got used to living here with these guys every day. I wouldn't trade it for nothing. This is my family now," Bonds said. "I love it here. I feel like the community embraces us as a basketball team as a whole They look at us like we're a symbol, a figure for the other guys. My host parents are great. They take care of me and they come to every game. I just really appreciate all the support SCC brings."

Another questioner was concerned about when the comprehensive master plan became a governing document. The panel members responded that the governance committee discussed that; it passed by a majority and the board adopted it as a governing document in July or August last year. Medica commented, "The CMP wasn't totally bad. People got bogged down in building a town center, which wasn't considered at all."   A lively discussion among Villagers and the panel concerned deterioration of some commercial buildings and what could be done. One concern was how those buildings might adversely impact visitors' impressions of the Village and their decisions on relocating to the Village. Another concern was safety due to mold and potential accidents on those properties.   Medica said that there had been a lot of discussion by the board about this and noted that owners of such properties had been told of the deficiencies. Beyond assessing fines related to building conditions, there was little that the Property Owners' Association could do about the properties, he said. Fines had been assessed and were being paid. Podawiltz commented, "Arkansas has some really weird property laws. Short of litigation, we've done about all we can." She added, "Cleaning up commercial properties is a goal for operations," noting, however, "the board doesn't have control over operations."   Podawiltz said, "We're going now to try to sell lots to people who will build houses." The Siega neighborhood, located off DeSoto just west of the Ponce de Leon Center, is an example of that. "They are smaller homes," Medica said, adding, "some will be bought by people who want to downsize."   Podawiltz said that one of the target markets was military retirees, because members of the military were not rooted to a home state due to their frequent reassignments.   A Villager reported that she had compared the building permit fees in the Village to some nearby areas and noted that the Village's fees were sometimes twice the fees of other areas. It was noted that the Village fees charged only cover the costs of putting the required infrastructure, including roads, into new neighborhoods. Those fees had not been raised for several years, while the costs had increased. Podawiltz noted that the fee is passed on to the home buyer.   People are buying homes in the west end, Medica said, and renovating them for short-term rentals such as through Airbnb. Podawiltz added, "There is money to be made here. We have a lot of challenges facing us, but we'll come through it."   Another Villager was concerned about accountability regarding the golf surcharge of $2.50. Podawiltz said it goes into a reserve account that can only be used for renovating and repairing golf courses and cannot be used for any other purpose. Medica noted that some of the courses are 50 years old, and all the courses will need to be repaired. Podawiltz added, "Every time you let a fix go undone, you jack up the day-to-day costs of maintenance."   The CMPAC's actions were questioned. One concern was whether the board was aware of whether the advisory committee's subcommittee on marketing's recommendations had been discussed by the board. They had not, Medica said, although the recommendations might be part of the presentation that advisory committee chair, Nikki Choyce, would make to the board at the board meeting Jan. 15.   Another Villager said she had learned that the advisory committee had discussed commercial growth during its last meeting. Her concern was that the board was saying that town centers were a non-issue, yet, the advisory committee was talking about it. A Villager who had attended the advisory committee's meeting Jan. 10, asked, "So why is there talk about a town center?" Medica responded, "I have discussed a medical town center." He would like to see a comprehensive medical services center inside the Village, he said. He added, "Some parts of the CMP are very good."   See the Jan. 14 issue of the Voice at www.hsvvoice.com for a report on the CMP advisory committee's Jan. 10 meeting. In that meeting, Murray Claassen had discussed traffic concerns that the Village could be facing in 20 years. Because the CMPAC chair had yet to provide a report to the board, the panel was unable to fully respond to the Villager's concerns.   Additionally, several attendees were curious about the third-party marketing services contracted by the POA. Medica reported that the POA had sent a request for proposals to 7 marketing firms. Of those, 2 had indicated they were not interested, 2 did not respond, and 3 responded with proposals. A brief discussion followed. See the article by Lewis Delavan on page 3A, for a discussion that Medica said would be had at the board meeting on Jan. 15.   The next Let's Talk will be in February; the date, time and location will be announced in a weekly Village Digest e-blast from the POA. Reserve an opportunity to ask questions by registering through the link in that announcement. Reservations are not required to attend and observe the sessions, and all Villagers are encouraged to attend, as the floor is opened to questions after all registrants' queries have been addressed. Regular board meetings and Let's Talk sessions are recorded and posted on the POA's YouTube channel.

One of my favorite holiday movies is "Home Alone." In the 1990 comedy, the McCallister family is planning a trip to Paris for the holidays, but oversleeps on the morning of their departure, which causes havoc. In their rush leave, the family accidentally forgets their youngest child, 8-year-old Kevin, and leave him home alone.      Chances are, you've seen the movie and you probably know the antics that ensue as Kevin protects the family's Chicago home from burglars.      But a scene I've always loved is the one of the large family rushing through the airport and barely making it on the plane. They get settled and after the plane takes off, the mother gasps "KEVIN!"      Now, I've never forgotten a child at home while on vacation, thank God. Vacations are stressful enough.      And while I've always loved the scene of the family rushing through the airport, trying to get to the gate on time, it's recently occurred to me how simpler things must have been for airline passengers in a pre-9/11 world.      The McAllister family obviously wasn't delayed by security. They didn't have to take off their shoes and their jackets. They didn't have to go through a full body scan machine. You don't see Kevin's family dragging carry-on size suitcases through the terminal in their rush for the gate. Today, the cost of checked luggage is so high, but back then then it was free.      And chances are, the parents didn't have to worry about what food options there were in that terminal because in 1990 most flights still provided food other than pretzels. (Although, I suppose, a transcontinental flight to Europe still provides meals.)      Last month, my family of five flew to California for New Year's. It was part family vacation - we took the kids to Disneyland and the San Diego Zoo. But it was a serious trip too, as we finally had a memorial service for our dad and spread some of his ashes at sea. We also finished emptying out the family home of the last 50 years.      We spent every second of that trip trying to make memories and enjoy the time with the kids, which meant the last day was rushed. Thirty minutes after our original "leave" time for the airport, I was still trying to cram everything into our carry-on size suitcases.      There were five of us, including our 10, 8 and 4-year-old kids. And there were six suitcases, five which were carry-on size (I'm not paying a fortune to check suitcases), three backpacks, a purse, my grandmother's ashes in an urn and a Star Wars robot from Disneyland. We looked like a herd of bogged-down camels, rushing to get to the airport.      Despite leaving later than planned, we returned the rental car and got to the terminal in decent time. We exited the rental car shuttle, entered an elevator that took us to the ticketing section of Terminal 4 at LAX airport, and then headed for the American Airlines desk. When we got to the self-help kiosk to get our boarding passes, I stopped to count my children. There were two - but we have three children.      "Where's Eliza?" I asked my two oldest kids, referring to their 4-year-old little sister. They shrugged. I asked my husband, in panic, "Where's Eliza?" He looked at our kids, then looked down the terminal where we had just dragged all of our belongings.      I shouted. "ELIZA?!?" which reverberated against the terminal's two-story ceilings. People turned around to look. I shouted again. My husband then dropped the bags and ran.      I told our older kids not to move and to stay with the bags, and then also ran down the ticketing hall, shouting Eliza's name.      She wasn't even in the building.      She was only gone a couple of minutes at most. A kind stranger saw my panicked husband and pointed him outside, where our scared pre-schooler stood on the sidewalk outside the airport next to the traffic. An airline attendant noticed our daughter all alone and was holding her hand. For that, I am so grateful.      Apparently, when we boarded the elevator as we first entered the airport, there were two doors, one that led inside the airport, and the other, which led back outside. As we exited the elevator toward the ticketing hall inside LAX, our daughter thought we were going back outside, and had walked through the wrong door.      Unlike "Home Alone" it was no comedy situation. It will probably be one of those moments I'll tell my grandkids about one day, the time we lost a kid in LAX. Hopefully by then we'll be able to laugh about it. For now, I'm still trying to calm my nerves.   Lydia Seabol Avant writes The Mom Stop for The Tuscaloosa News in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.

Other militaries have already had success migrating to the cloud. The United Kingdom has implemented a “cloud-first approach” which mandates that all purchases of IT products and services must first be considered through the cloud. Private firms helped the Australian Department of Defence move various systems to the cloud, including its non-material procurement, material procurement, and other acquisition programs. This process involved linking 13 different, non-interacting systems into a transparent and interlinked procurement program accessible by all users.
