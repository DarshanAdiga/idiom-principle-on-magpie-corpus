Sherman’s sympathies at the time were decidedly Southern, but more importantly, throughout his career, Sherman always sided firmly with law and order and legitimate authority. In May 1856, he believed that a show of overwhelming force by the militia up front would head off bloodshed. Johnson and Sherman met with the commander of the Mare Island naval base, David Farragut, who insisted that he could not directly aid the militia without orders from Washington, but agreed to dispatch a ship “for moral effect.” Believing that General John Wool, the local Army commander, had agreed to supply arms and ammunition to Sherman’s militia, Johnson then declared San Francisco to be “in a state of insurrection.” Sherman met with members of the Vigilance Committee, who warned of “terrible” consequences, and he bluntly ordered them to “remove your fort; cease your midnight councils; and prevent your armed bodies from patrolling the streets.” But Wool got cold feet and informed Johnson and Sherman that he could offer no assistance without a direct order from President Franklin Pierce.

Asked about his role in the team, Rahane said: "I don't know. We have to wait and watch as we start our practice sessions, then only we will have that communication."
 "I have opened throughout my career and I have enjoyed that. But (it is) completely up to the team management as to what role they want to give me in the team. I will 100 per cent do that," the 32-year-old told mediapersons in a web conference on Thursday.
 So, does he think that a finisher's role in T20 can work for him? The senior batsman said he is open to the idea.
 "If I am told to bat at No 5 or 6 , I will definitely take it as it will be a new role for me and help me explore my game. So if you ask me, my answer is yes, I am ready," said Rahane, who is only 12 runs short of career 5000 runs in T20 cricket (4988 from 196 games).
 But will two to three weeks of net sessions be enough to help him acquire the mindset of a finisher?
 Rahane said five to six sessions along with proper communication from the team management about the assigned role should be enough.
 However, he agreed that field restrictions work to the advantage of top-three in white ball cricket.
 "Frankly speaking, when you have two fielders outside the circle, you have the freedom to express yourself. Also the field is completely spread in T20 cricket (after first six overs). Till no.3, you can play with freedom...You get 15 to 20 runs and you are on," he said.
 He is still not over the pain of missing out on last year's World Cup and didn't hide his disappointment about not being India's no.4 in England.
 "I was actually thinking I would be there at the World Cup as no.4. That's gone now and the goal is to make a comeback into the ODI team and do well in white ball cricket."
 "People talk about strike rates and averages. Before getting dropped, my record in 50-over cricket was good. I believe in having faith in myself rather than what people are saying. I am sure I will be back," he asserted.
 It will be Rahane's first stint under Ricky Ponting, the DC head coach, and he is sure that the tips from the legendary former Australian captain will help him become a better cricketer overall.
 "For any player, growth is important. Playing under Ricky Ponting (is something) I am excited about. As a player you want to grow and learn. This is the best opportunity to take my game one step forward." Rahane said.
 "Because of this COVID-19, you can't spent too much time together but we can call him and discuss cricket," he said.
 On Ponting, he was also asked about the difference of opinion between the coach and senior spinner Ravichandran Ashwin on the contentious topic of running out non-strikers who back up too far.

 "Ashwin can answer that better and Ricky has already answered that question. The news is all over," Rahane responded.
 "Let's keep it that way. We are playing for the same team now, so it is important that we stick by each other and back each other," added Rahane, who was the Rajasthan Royals skipper when Ashwin had ran Jos Buttler out at the non-striker's end last season.

Minister Fitzgibbon discouraged investors. Six of the seven qualified bids were abandoned. At the end of the day, the offer from Investissement Québec and Pallinghurst to buy the assets and dismantle Nemaska was the last one standing. Promises were betrayed, Quebec shareholders are cheated. Not only did individual shareholders lose everything, although they collectively represented the majority of the stock at around $ 100 million (more than Investissement Québec), but the offer also denies existing individual shareholders' participation in the "new Nemaska". The offer announced on Monday will give Quebec a bad reputation. Investors will refuse such political interference.

Manchester City have refused to comment on reports linking them with wantaway Barcelona star Lionel Messi.
 Messi sent shockwaves through world football when he informed Barca via burofax on Tuesday that he wanted to leave, putting several clubs on high alert.
 A reunion with Pep Guardiola at City has been mooted, but the club declined to comment when contacted by Stats Perform News. It is believed they do not want to take a public position on such a high-profile story.
 Guardiola has previously stated his belief that Messi would, and indeed should, see out his career at Camp Nou, where he is the all-time leading goalscorer.
 "He is a player from Barcelona and he will stay there, that's my wish for him to stay there," he said in February.
 "I'm not going to talk about players playing for other clubs. I think he will finish his career there, that's my wish."
 However, the notion that Guardiola would turn down the chance to sign arguably the world's greatest player following a season in which his side lost out to Liverpool in the Premier League, and again failed in the Champions League, seems absurd.
 With his reputation at Barca still firmly intact following a fine playing career and a spell at the helm during which the club were twice crowned champions of Europe, Guardiola will not want to be seen to be actively pursuing Messi.
 That would explain any outward reticence, but it is unlikely the Etihad Stadium club would not be considering an approach.
 Chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak has only recently outlined a new transfer policy expanding the club's search beyond the usual age range of 20- to 25-year-olds, putting a 33-year-old Messi firmly on the agenda.
 City are not the only club to have been linked to Messi, with Champions League runners-up and fellow financial heavyweights Paris Saint-Germain said to be in the mix, along with Inter.
 Staying at Barca remains an option, but Messi is clearly unhappy and there has been no indication that Josep Maria Bartomeu is willing to step aside, with the president having overseen a staffing overhaul that brought Ronald Koeman to the helm this month.
 Quite what the Dutchman will be making of this transfer saga in the early days of his reign is anyone's guess.
 With or without Messi, Koeman has a rebuilding job on his hands, the scale of which was underlined by Barca's humiliating 8-2 Champions League loss to Bayern Munich, a result that probably hastened the talisman's decision to send that now famous fax.

"You’re hoping to see parts of that again, and realizing that he’s been there, done that, there’s a lot to that as well. The experience, the stuff, the competitive nature in what they’re seeing in his pitch execution right now. You’re getting a guy that’s highly motivated to show the baseball world the pitcher that he still is. You always look for those guys with those traits.”

Lionel Messi has informed Barcelona of his desire to leave but new arrival Francisco Trincao hopes the club captain remains at Camp Nou.
 Barca agreed a €31million move for Trincao in January, with the 20-year-old attacker spending the remainder of the 2019-20 season at Braga.
 He was presented to the media on Wednesday but much of the attention was focused on Messi, who wants to make use of a break clause in his contract.
 Fans gathered outside of club offices on Tuesday to call for the resignation of president Josep Maria Bartomeu, who was present for a ceremonial contract signing with Trincao but left newly appointed sporting director Ramon Planes to face questions from the media.
 Planes said the club were still intending to build their squad around Messi and were doing their utmost to retain his services.
 Trincao expressed his excitement at joining Barca and hopes he will get the chance to play alongside the six-time Ballon d'Or winner.
 "Of course I want him to stay. We'll see what happens," said Trincao.
 "I arrived two weeks ago and I'm here to do my job and be a benchmark for this club.
 "I am very happy to be here and I hope to be able to have many games, goals and assists.
 "Everyone has had their story and I want to create mine and make history."
 Messi's decision came after his close friend Luis Suarez was reportedly told by new coach Ronald Koeman he should find a new club.
 Trincao is yet to speak to Koeman to find out what sort of role he can expect in his first season in LaLiga.
 "I have to talk to the coach first, but I can play in all of the attacking positions," said Trincao.
 "I feel comfortable in all of them and I am here to help. We'll see what the coach wants from me."

erhaps no economic idea has penetrated the American mainstream more successfully than “the manufacturing jobs aren’t coming back.” It’s a high- status position to hold, shared by public intellectuals of all stripes, from _New York Times_ editors to Ivy League economists to American presidents, trickling down to a thousand armchair policy wonks. Prestigious publications churn out article after article repeating this position, and the numbers appear to back it up: American manufacturing employment has been declining for 30 years, even as we produce more manufactured goods than ever before.

Avevamo chiesto più tamponi ma la nostra regione risulta sempre tra le ultime. Perché?? Avevamo chiesto a marzo, a maggio e a luglio, quando ci sono state le varie aperture nel nostro Paese, di fare tamponi a chi viaggiava, ma solo da pochi giorni si comincia a fare qualcosa. Perché?? Abbiamo chiesto di sapere se in questi mesi siano state rafforzate le reti territoriali sanitarie, i medici e gli infermieri in prima linea, ambulatori, presidi ospedalieri e di prossimità, dispositivi di sicurezza. Tutto tace. Perché?? Avevamo chiesto di sapere che fine avesse fatto la proposta di scioglimento per camorra dell'Asl Napoli 1 che sta gestendo prevenzione della salute in città e fiumi di denaro pubblico. Ma evidentemente il tema non è prioritario per il Governo. Eppure sarebbe interesse anche delle tante donne ed uomini che lavorano con competenza e coraggio nella più grande azienda sanitaria del Sud. Perché questo silenzio?? Ebbene, sono in tanti evidentemente ad essere troppo impegnati a fare liste elettorali bulimiche dove si saggia il disgusto di una macedonia andata a male. Ormai è noto a tanti che la pandemia serve anche per fare campagna elettorale e fare voti, sulla pelle della gente e sfruttando le paure delle persone.

For, though I understand and half-share Hazony’s pessimism, I think we should both acknowledge that a conservative resistance would itself exert an influence across the entire spectrum. My one quarrel with him is his argument is that the ideological refugees are always from liberalism to Marxism, never the other way round. When the flag of conservative resistance is raised — and it’s usually raised late in the day — we witness a flight of refugees not only from liberalism to conservatism but also from Marxism itself to conservatism. Few ex-Marxists stop at liberalism not because they despise it — quite the contrary, they generally value its liberties and conventions — but because they doubt its ability to preserve those things against future attack. They go straight to conservatism because they sense a formidable determination to protect what are not only virtuous liberal freedoms but also prized national traditions. Burke in his day, Thatcher, De Gaulle, and the neo-conservatives 50 years ago resisted the assaults of revolution and soon found themselves welcoming converts from radicalism. But such revivals need resistance in the first place.

Russian President Vladimir Putin says there is a reserve of Russian law enforcement officers prepared to enter Belarus to stop the protests in that country.
 This reserve will be used only if the situation gets out of control, "if extremists, hiding behind political slogans, cross certain boundaries and start looting, setting fire to cars, homes, banks, attempting to seize administrative buildings, and so on," Putin said on Thursday.
 He said the reserve had already been formed upon the request of Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko as part of the close alliance between Russia and neighbouring Belarus.
 "I hope there will be no need to use this reserve," Putin said in a state television interview, according to a transcript posted on the Kremlin's website.

As the world's largest cruise line, Carnival can't be written off entirely in the long run. Consumers may embrace different vacation modes next year (or possibly just stay closer to home), but sea cruises will inevitably come back. This is just a recovery process that will take years, and Carnival stock isn't likely to bounce back until the industry's prospects improve.

Well, our 18 launches were diverse, as always, led of course by Posaconazole, which was a breakthrough launch for us. We want to do more of those, obviously. But we had a lot of other medium-sized launches over the course of the year, whether it's the Amphetamine IR salts, whether it was some of the BAC products that we launched early in the year, Propranolol, what have you. So by and large, our products are single-digit millions for our portfolio. We've talked about trying to get out 20-ish products a year that generate $70 million. That's just an average of around three or so. But we'd like to get that mean or median up to a higher number, which is what we're doing now as we discussed just a few moments ago relating to some of the in-process R&D that was terminated.

Got it, got it. And then let me talk about the pipeline a bit, so obviously you gave us both the weighted and non-weighted color in the pipeline. I guess -- I had a couple of questions there. One, when you look at that pipeline, and you're trying to normalize and this maybe a question you can't answer but normalized for what COVID has lengthened. How is that percentage -- can you give us any sense of that? So if I take all the deals that should, of course were moving from the pipeline, what does that look like? Do you have -- I mean, I'm sure you have that sense. I wonder if you can share some of that color with us.

Drugmakers want to avoid even that modest change by voluntarily lowering prices on the same drugs by 10%.
 “This is something,” Mattingly observed. “But neither proposal comes close to addressing prices of major drugs like insulin that many people use.”
 It’s infuriating, particularly in light of the fact that we know from the example of our economic peers how drug prices can be brought to reasonable levels.
 First, you allow a large-scale government insurance program to negotiate prices with manufacturers. Medicare, representing about 60 million U.S. beneficiaries, is prevented by law from doing that.

Iannucci, who fired curare-tipped arrows of hate in every direction on his BBC political series _The Thick of It_ , its big-screen spin-off _In the Loop_ , and its American cousin _Veep,_ later proved able fluently to translate his putdowns into Communist in _The Death of Stalin._ But now he has put down his weapons, wiped his bloody hands on his shirt, and set about trying to bake us all a nice sponge cake: His latest is a more or less earnest adaptation of Dickens’s most delightful novel, here called _The Personal History_ of _David Copperfield_. Does it work? In the words of one of Iannucci’s characters, it goes about as smoothly as a sweaty octopus trying to take off a bra.

 She continued: "This Morrisons box had a family size chicken pie, two microwave carbonaras, mushrooms and cheesy chicken breasts.
 "It also had bacon, cook in the bag chicken, lettuce, microwave mash, vegetable medley, sausages and a microwave fish and chips.
 "If I paid full price for all of that I reckon it would have cost around £25 to £30."

In the players' auction which was held in December last year, Cummins became the most expensive foreign player as he was bought by Kolkata Knight Riders for a whopping price of INR 15.5 crore.
 "We wanted somebody who is probably world-class and there is no one better than Pat Cummins in the world right now, he is the best bowler in the world, it is an absolute privilege to have him on board," Dinesh Karthik said in a video posted on the official website of IPL.
 "The little conversations I have had with him shows that he is a gem of a guy and this matters a lot to me. He will come into the team and impart knowledge to the younger guys and this will hold everyone in good stead," he added.
 All eight IPL franchises have reached UAE for taking part in the upcoming tournament.
 All players and team personnel are required to undergo a six-day quarantine period after landing in the UAE and everyone needs to be tested for Covid-19 thrice.
 Once, they all test negative for Covid-19, the players can start training in the UAE with their team-mates.

First, a note about the title. Why all the extra words? Why isn't it just called "David Copperfield?" You should be grateful. The Charles Dickens novel, published serially beginning in 1849, was known as "The Personal History, Adventures, Experience, and Observation of David Copperfield the Younger of Blunderstone Rookery (Which He Never Meant to be Published on Any Account)."
 Second, an explanation of my relationship with "David Copperfield." I've never read it (isn't it something like 900 pages long?) and, until now, I'd never seen any feature film or made-for-TV movie based on it. So, there'll be no comparisons of the work by Mr. Dickens to the screenplay by Simon Blackwell or the direction by Armando Iannucci.
 It's quite obvious that cuts have been made, that scenes and (I've been told) even characters have been eliminated, in that the film comes in at a comparatively compact two-hour running time. But to the questions: Is it a good story and is it well told?, the answers to both are a resounding yes.
 I did check out the Project Gutenberg Ebook of "David Copperfield" and can attest to the fact that the first line of both the novel and the film is, "Whether I shall turn out to be the hero of my own life, or whether that station will be held by anybody else, these pages must show."
 I'll only know of other similarities if I one day sit down to read the book. For now, here's what you've got in store in this wonderfully entertaining film.
 It's jam-packed with characters, and I use that word in an imaginative, expressive manner. Our titular protagonist, played with compassion and energetic zest by Dev Patel, is one of the film's few "normal" people, and is joined in that category by possible love interest Agnes (a glowing Rosalind Eleazar). Pretty much everyone else around David goes over the top in displaying some sort of odd personality, whether it be pushy Betsey Trotwood (Tilda Swinton), evil Murdstone (Darren Boyd), rascally Mr. Micawber (Peter Capaldi - "Dr. Who" fans rejoice!), slimy Uriah Heep (Ben Wishaw), addled Mr. Dick (Hugh Laurie), or bubbleheaded Dora Spenlow (Morfydd Clark).
 The story - the autobiography, really - is told from the point of view of David, looking back on the freewheeling, troubled, rewarding, ultimately happy life he's been living. He's introduced as a storyteller in the opening frames, and that's no surprise, as he's seen, throughout the film, jotting down notes on scraps of paper - whether they be his own thoughts or words that others have said.
 So, we learn of his widowed mother marrying the awful man Murdstone, and Murdstone's dastardly plan to send young David off to the city to work in a dreadful bottling factory. And we find out early on that no matter what misfortunes the young lad - and later the young man - faces, he is a kind and generous soul who just wants to help others.
 No matter how bad things get for David, and a few other individuals, one of the reasons that Dickens' book has been and this film should be so popular is that it also boasts a terrific sense of humor, which is put across here with dialogue, line delivery, body movements, and even a bit of slapstick.
 Changes in David's life come flying at him with regularity. After too much emotional abuse at the bottle factory, he runs off to live with demanding Aunt Betsey, who appears to be the guardian of poor, mixed up Mr. Dick, both of whom turn out to be kindly. Then David heads off to school, where he meets up with enigmatic fellow student Steerforth (Aneurin Barnard), one of many people from whom David feels a need to hide what he considers his lowly family background. Then there's the accountant Wickfield (Benedict Wong) and his lovely daughter Agnes and, best of all, hiding from every debt-collector in town, the colorful Mr. Micawber.
 So many people, so much storytelling, such a winning performance by Patel of a character I'd like to know even better. Perhaps it's time for me to read the book.
 "The Personal History of David Copperfield" opens theatrically on Aug. 28. Please check the website of your local cinema for safety guidelines during the pandemic.

Celtic were stunned by Ferencvaros in the second round of Champions League qualifying on Wednesday, losing 2-1 in Glasgow.
 Tokmac Nguen's second-half goal sent the Hungarian side through and consigned the Scottish champions to a third season in a row without reaching the group stage.
 A superb strike from David Siger put Ferencvaros ahead after only seven minutes with what was their only shot in the first half.
 Celtic, who finished the game with 70 per cent of the possession and 28 shots to the visitors' seven, were level after 53 minutes thanks to a powerful effort from Ryan Christie.
 Olivier Ntcham rattled the crossbar with a half-volley and Mohamed Elyounoussi had a goal disallowed for a marginal offside before Ferencvaros' sucker punch.
 Nguen ran onto a long clearance, held off a tame challenge from Hatem Elhamed and squeezed a shot beneath Vasilios Barkas.
 Celtic will now drop into Europa League qualifying, while Ferencvaros head into Monday's draw for the next round.

NEW ORLEANS - Fifteen years ago this week, a Coast Guard helicopter pulled Webster Rainy from his niece's rooftop in the Lower 9th Ward as floodwaters swallowed his neighbors in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.
 Monday, Rainy, 68, calmly cleaned his car and smoked through a pack of Kools, undaunted by the prospect of two storms - one nearly broken up, the other growing and unpredictable - headed in his general direction.
 "I feel safer in the 9th Ward than anywhere else," Rainy said in front of his home two blocks from where flood walls failed in 2005, sending water into the neighborhood. "It'll take more than water to break through those walls now."
 Saturday, New Orleans residents will observe the 15th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, the storm that unleashed deadly floods throughout the city in 2005 after man-made levees and flood walls failed. More than 1,800 people died along the Gulf Coast, many of whom drowned in the Lower 9th Ward. Images of residents rescued from rooftops became searing reminders of the storm's cataclysmic aftermath, and the lack of local preparation and national response.
 After Katrina, Congress approved nearly $15 billion in projects to protect the greater New Orleans region, including massive floodgates, storm surge barriers, rebuilt flood walls and rearmored levees, and a mammoth pump station designed to carry massive amounts of water away from homes and into wetlands.
 The system is designed to resist surge from a 100-year storm, one with a 1% chance of forming in any given year. It eased the nerves of residents who remember the chaos and death of Katrina.
 Though the system offers greater protection than the flawed levees and flood walls that guarded the city before Katrina, the area still needs better protection, given rising sea levels and vanishing wetlands that act as speed bumps against storm surge, said Mark Davis, director of the Tulane Institute on Water Resources Law and Policy.
 The region needs at least a 300- to 500-year storm protection system to stand a chance against rising seas and stronger, more punishing storms, he said.
 "The system is not evolving to keep pace with evolving risk," Davis said.
 Monday, New Orleans received a reprieve when Marco, one of the storms headed its way, largely disintegrated as it neared the coast. The other, Laura, was about to enter the Gulf of Mexico and was forecast to make landfall near the Texas-Louisiana border, far enough away not to menace the city.
 City officials voiced relief about being out of forecasters' "cone of probability" for both storms but cautioned residents not to let their guard down. Laura still has miles of warm water in the Gulf to travel over.
 "Just because we're out of the cone doesn't mean we can't be significantly impacted," New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell said at a news conference. "Do not let up."
 Residents, anxious about a double-storm wallop hours before, awoke Monday to blue skies and a calming breeze. Most of the French Quarter remained as closed as it has been under the coronavirus pandemic, though business owners, residents and visitors milled about, mostly unconcerned with the offshore storms.
 A four-piece brass band entertained morning diners at Cafe du Monde, the iconic beignet eatery. Revert "Peanut" Andrews, the group's trombonist and a well-known musician in town, said he evacuated from his 9th Ward home during Katrina. It took him years to return to the city. Today, he lives in Uptown, a neighborhood that didn't flood as badly after Katrina.
 His confidence in the city's hurricane protection system has risen over the years, he said, though he still believes New Orleans could be blindsided by a major storm. He's sticking around for Marco and Laura.
 "I'm quite sure it'll happen again," Andrews said, "but I don't think it'll be as bad."
 Cliff Ocheltree, 70, rode out Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Gustav, Ike and Isaac from his second-story French Quarter apartment, all without incident. Monday, he fiddled with a crossword puzzle on his balcony overlooking Ursulines Avenue. He prepared for Marco and Laura, he said, by restocking the rows of water, Gatorade and breakfast bars in his hurricane closet.
 "Katrina was not a storm issue. It was a levee failure issue," he said. "And there's been a lot of work done on that."
 Much of that work consisted of armoring levees with concrete, including those that failed in Katrina's wake. Hurricane preparation and response must be carefully coordinated between the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, meteorologists and local and state officials, said Bob Jacobsen, a consultant and engineer who has reviewed the flood protection system.
 If a storm the size of Katrina hit the city, the complex system of levees and flood walls would probably hold, he said. But the system is designed largely to protect property - not lives - and to keep flood insurance premiums down. A direct hit on New Orleans by a large storm could cause widespread deaths if the most vulnerable parts of the city were not evacuated, Jacobsen said.
 "It's like having a sprinkler system in a building," he said. "You're supposed to evacuate, not sit around watching the building burn."
 In the Lower 9th Ward, one of the neighborhoods devastated by the flooding after Katrina, residents biked around or lounged on porches, blocks away from where a flood wall collapsed and inundated the neighborhood 15 years ago.
 Rainy said he remembers wading through chest-high water after Hurricane Betsy flooded the neighborhood in 1965. He's survived Hurricanes Andrew, Katrina, Rita, Gustav, Ike and Isaac here, too. He's seen the teams of workers strengthen the nearby levees and flood walls after Katrina. This is the most confident he's ever been in the neighborhood.
 Still, if a Category 3 or 4 hurricane aimed at New Orleans, he wouldn't stick around to see if everything worked. "Been there, done that," he said. "We'll be ready to go."

We're not the only people out there searching for those assets. But as you talk about the sort of run of the mill generics that can create nice value, we do very well in that space. That's distinct and apart from a drug device combination or a biologic insulin where I think those are more challenging for us, but we don't need very many of them to get to where we want to go. But for the core generic markets, we still find ourselves doing extremely well, even Levorphanol we launched this quarter is another example of a great generic product that we're able to bring in-house and get some substantial share shortly after starting that conversation. So we see a BD flow of products to remain healthy. We have a few things we're working on that we hope will make additional impact for us this year and beyond. And don't see any real material challenges to what that looks like going forward.

Secrets that could destroy the world.

Gamescom is generally the last major hurrah for new games and indie titles to make a splash before the holidays and, this year, the release of the next gen consoles. COVID-19 forced the event to go virtual, but as always, the German convention had plenty to reveal.

Once the countries complete their flights tests, the Joint Operational Evaluation Board, which includes regulators from Canada, Europe and Brazil, will run simulator exercises to evaluate proposed changes to pilot training.
 If reviews of the 737 MAX's safety upgrades and accompanying training protocols do not raise new concerns, the FAA will issue an order rescinding the grounding of the plane.
 Boeing told analysts in late July that 737 MAX deliveries would resume in the fourth quarter, a timeline that raises the prospect that the aircraft's U.S. return to service could slip into 2021.

Since Seth Whiting was hired as head football coach, Alliance has gradually built a winning culture.  
 Under Whiting, the Aviators have gone 28-15 the last four years, qualified for postseason play the last three seasons and claimed three straight conference championships, going undefeated in the league all three seasons.  
 "Our goal was to become a football program with sustained success," Whiting said. "We think we've raised the expectations from our kids and community, but we want to keep building on it."  
 Heading into his fifth season as Alliance head coach, Whiting believes his current team has a different identity than any of his four previous squads.  
 "We feel we have great depth," he said. "We think we're two-deep at every position."  
 Alliance, which finished 7-4 overall and 6-0 against Eastern Buckeye Conference competition in 2019, returns to Division III after a one-year stay in Division II and a competitive region featuring Massillon, Akron Hoban and Perry. However, the return to Division III won't make it easier for the Aviators, even though they don't have to worry about qualifying for the playoffs this year after the state approved an open postseason tournament.  
 "There excellent teams in Division III, especially in our region," Whiting said. "There also is quality depth."  
 When it comes to position depth, Alliance is loaded at quarterback, with two returning starters and a talented young prospect. Seniors Brandon Alexander (6-3, 220) and Braidyn Hartsoe (6-1, 190) split time taking snaps last season. Both were dual threats. Alexander, who gave a verbal commitment to Youngstown State this summer, was 59 of 113 passing (52%) for 671 yards and five touchdowns, and he added 468 rushing yards (4.3 avg.) and two scores. Hartsoe, who was inserted as the starter after Alexander was injured in the sixth game at Canton South, was also productive, finishing 43 of 69 (62%) for 964 yards with eight touchdowns, and he added 200 rushing yards and four scores. In addition to the two veterans, freshman Brendan Zurbrugg (6-2, 165) adds depth at quarterback.  
 While the quarterback spot is led by two veterans, the running back spot is loaded with sophomores, headed by Kayden Davis (6-2, 190), Ex'Ziriaun Williamson (5-9, 140) and Jaxson Cooper (5-10, 165). Junior Marqwayil Greer (5-9, 190) also is in the mix for playing time.  
 "We're a spread team that wants to be able to run and throw the football, but we want to be a run-first team, so we need good backs," Whiting said.  
 Complementing the offensive backs are the receivers, headed by senior tight end Andrew Datz (6-2, 240) and senior wide receiver Dylan Bugara (5-7, 150). Datz, who also has given a look at running back, was a playmaker last season, finishing with 14 receptions for 329 yards (23.5 avg.) and four touchdowns. Bugara, who possesses good speed, added eight catches for 131 yards (16.4 avg.) and also averaged 13 yards on three carries. Seniors Tre Hawkins (5-11, 200) and Jhon Howard (5-9, 165), junior Jordan Simms (6-1, 190), and sophomores Carter Bugara (5-9, 165) and Ovie Jones (5-8, 150) are the other wideouts. Alexander looked comfortable at wideout after returning late in the regular season and is another candidate. Junior Tyriq Mason (5-9, 170) brings depth to tight end.  
 During Whiting's time as head coach, he favors rotating offensive linemen and Alliance has both the personnel and depth to continue that philosophy. The tackles are senior Blayne Reith (6-2, 210) and junior Thomas Butt (5-10, 210), two returners. Senior Cody Thompson (5-10, 255), another veteran, moves to center. Senior Markell Davis (6-1, 300), junior Jahkai Martin (5-11, 260) and senior Rico Curry (6-2, 275) are good-sized guards which could make the zone running game sparkle. The other two offensive linemen in the rotation are senior Kyle Daniel (5-10, 200) and junior Hunter Berlin (6-0, 200).  
 Many of the offensive starters are projected to play on defense, which is a 3-4 base with multiple looks.  
 Datz, who accrued 44 tackles, six tackles for loss and 1 ½ sacks, returns at one end, with Daniel, Reith and Berlin at the other end. Markell Davis, a returner, and Curry, are the top two nose tackles.  
 Howard, who is solid run stopper and is versatile and quick enough to rush the quarterback or drop in coverage on pass plays, returns at outside linebacker. Senior Dewayne Davis (6-4, 190) will get the nod at the other outside linebacker spot. Hartsoe, an impact player with 90 tackles, 12 tackles for loss, six sacks and two interceptions, and Martin are active inside linebackers, with Greer, Mason and senior Corey Prendergast (5-11, 205) supplying depth.  
 Dylan Bugara, who registered 42 tackles and three interceptions, returns at cornerback. Jones and senior Jabril Gilmore (5-9, 140) are vying for the other starting cornerback spot. Senior Grant McGeehan (6-0, 165), another veteran, is back at safety. Kayden Davis, Alexander and Carter Bugara are the prominent candidates to join McGeehan at safety.  
 "Our defensive [mentality] is the same," Whiting said. "We want to be aggressive, yet disciplined."  
 Dylan Bugara returns at punter and return specialist. He averaged 39.1 as a punter on 25 attempts, and averaged 15 yards as a kickoff returner and 13 yards as a punt return specialist. Carter Bugara and Zurbrugg are two candidates for the vacated placekicking spot.  
 "We've had a good summer," Whiting said. "We're taking things day by day, getting ready for the season, and controlling the things we can control."

Commercial roll out of the ambitious 5G technology in India has been in a hang for years now with the delay seemingly stretching over and beyond 2020 as well. While the industry has been in conflict with the government over what it contends as high pricing and scanty availability of the spectrum in the 3.3-3.6 GHz bands, the financial knockout on account of AGR has effectively made the operators incapable of bidding within this fiscal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Even though Airtel, Vodafone Idea, Jio and BSNL submitted applications to conduct field trials with DoT on January 15,  industry experts still see 5G coming to India by 2022 since telcos having their balance sheets badly bruised lack monetary headroom to bid for the final auctions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   In contrast, just two days before the new year, on December 30, the government allowed Chinese player Huawei (read all vendors) to conduct field trials in partnership with the telecom players. The move came after India’s prolonged silence over Huawei’s participation in 5G deployments in light of the United States pressing India to bar Huawei from deploying the network. India, however, finally took a position on the issue as it juggles to maintain strategic balance with two of its major trade partners--China and the US.

As the coronavirus crisis flooded Instacart with a surge of new customers, the company added more than 300,000 hourly and contract shoppers and said it would stop penalizing those who fall short of speed and efficiency requirements. Shoppers such as Hartson, however, continue to be graded on other metrics and could still face reprimand for reliability incidents. And they still receive regular reports on whether they meet speed and efficiency targets.
 “They’re tracking all this data,” Hartson said. “Will they go back and use this as a pretense to fire people?”
 Montalvo said such data is for now “purely a personal guide.”
 “We believe it’s important that shoppers are aware and understand the significant role they play in delivering a great customer experience, which is why we focus on the details related to each order,” Montalvo said.

A járvány kirobbanásakor az új világrend egyértelműen a home office volt. A nyár végével azonban ez visszarendeződni látszik, egyre többen térnek vissza az irodai környezetbe. Ennek legfőbb oka a humán faktor, ugyanis egyre hangosabb az igény a személyes találkozásokra és az élő kapcsolattartásra. A munkarend kialakítása terén a cégek jelenleg többféle modellt követnek az otthoni munkavégzéstől az irodába való teljes visszatérésig. Van, ahol hibrid megoldásokat alkalmaznak, félig online, félig személyes működéssel. Egy közös pont azonban kirajzolódik: a legtöbb cég az irodai teret sokkal rugalmasabban kezdte el értelmezni, mint eddig, a munkáltatók pedig fontos feladatot kaptak – eljött az ideje az „out of the box” megoldásoknak, a megváltozott körülmények között is a legmegfelelőbb feltételeket biztosítva.

"Hurricane Laura is an extremely dangerous storm that continues to strengthen as it moves through the Gulf," said EEI President Tom Kuhn. "Electric companies in Laura's path are mobilized and ready. They have activated their emergency response plans and the industry's mutual assistance network, are staging equipment, and are coordinating preparation and response efforts with federal, state, and local officials. Based on the intensity and destructive nature of this storm, power restoration efforts could be slowed by prolonged high winds and dangerous and extreme flooding and surge conditions. Safety is our industry's number one priority, and crews will work around the clock to restore power when and where they can, provided it is safe to do so."

I do think there are some consequences that create some conflict relative to overseas inspections, which is already a bit of a unleveled playing field to begin with and it's exacerbated by the difficulty in travel now to do on-site inspections. The FDA has spoken about doing more remote work in that space as well. But that's the one area where we see certain opportunities perhaps not moving as quickly as we might like them to because they may be tied up with some form of a site inspection. Again, our plants here in the U.S., those sites can be inspected so that can actually work OK for us for today. But by and large, we think the FDA is doing a great job in conjunction with where we see what we're all managing against in the marketplace.

A poco de tan bárbaro suceso comenta el historiador F. Palma comenzó la repoblación lenta e inorgánica de esa región. Retornaron algunos vecinos indios fueron muy pocos en busca del hogar perdido y otros arraigaron en El Hormiguero, un tanto a trasmano del viejo pueblo, cuyo trazo se iba desdibujando por la vegetación que crecía incontroladamente, ahogando y recubriendo casas y calles.

Most of these products, as you know from a generic perspective, you can't get to over time. And it's less to do about your risk on development elements and it is about who else shows up when you get there. And so trying to do a more precise job considering our strengths. And the competitive context is something we're looking to do more and more. We feel really excited about the out year portfolio from internal development. We obviously feel very excited about the business development portfolio from those efforts. But it takes time on the internal side, and we're just starting to bear fruit on those efforts.

Motorola Solutions Inc. (MSI) shares on Wednesday's trading session, dropped -0.94 percent to see the stock exchange hands at $153.33 per unit. Lets a quick look at company’s past reported and future predictions of growth using the EPS Growth. EPS growth is a percentage change in standardized earnings per share over the trailing-twelve-month period to the current year-end. The company posted a value of $4.80 as earning-per-share over the last full year, while a chance, will post $8.59 for the coming year. The current EPS Growth rate for the company during the year is -4.10% and predicted to reach at 15.14% for the coming year. In-depth, if we analyze for the long-term EPS Growth, the out-come was 30.20% for the past five years and the scenario is totally different as the current prediction is 10.32% for the next five year.

Mooi verhaal van Grapperhaus, lekker kort ook. Kraakt aan alle en deugt van weinig kanten. Mensen hebben voor heel wat minder een boete (+ strafblad) van een BOA frusti aangesmeerd gekregen of mogen hun toko (op last van nog forsere boetes) op slot houden. Ondertussen neemt de bereidheid - tot het opvolgen van de maatregelen - alleen maar af, zwalkt het regeringsbeleid all over the place en beginnen OMT en RIVM een soort van Deep State houding aan te nemen en orakelt Yasser dat er nu een soort van basisinkomen moet komen. Over de vraag hoe we dat gaan betalen moest Yasser het antwoord schuldig blijven (surprise, surprise). Het is tijdens zwaar weer (of zelfs storm) dat je de kwaliteiten van kapiteins leert kennen.

"Miami invited the world to come LIVEITMIAMI and we can confidently say we delivered one of the best Super Bowl's the world has ever seen," said Rodney Barreto, Chairman Miami Super Bowl Host Committee. "In a town where big events are par for the course, we are grateful that both the private and public sector stepped up to help us deliver this huge win. We last hosted a Super Bowl in 2010 and we showed the world how much we have grown and flourished as a diverse, multicultural city".

Finally, the software update really shines in personalization. An entire house can be segmented into different zones, and a personal schedule can be uploaded. With the push of a button or a voice command, Roomba can be told to clean the baby's room twice a day (but not during nap time, of course), or Braava can be sent to mop under the table after every meal.

Officials said at least 150 people refused pleas to leave and planned to weather the storm in everything from elevated homes to recreational vehicles in coastal Cameron Parish, which could be completely covered by ocean water.

“Continueremo ad aggiornare puntualmente i cittadini sui dati che ci pervengono, perché è fondamentale che conoscano l’evoluzione del Covid-19 in maniera corretta e veritiera, visto che molto spesso sono circolate notizie che non erano vere, ma si sono propagate velocemente”, ha puntualizzato il sindaco, nel ringraziare l’Usl Umbria 1 “per le informazioni e la collaborazione che ci assicura”. Ancora una volta il primo cittadino ha invitato a tenere nella dovuta considerazione che “ci stiamo avvicinando a un momento delicato, importante e significativo come quello della riapertura delle scuole, sul quale dovremo lavorare con grande attenzione, consapevoli che alcuni rischi inevitabilmente ci sono, ma consapevoli anche che è una scelta che va compiuta con la massima determinazione e con il più grande senso di responsabilità”.

COAI, the body that represents telecom players and vendors recently said that Indian operators are likely to push back 5G network deployments by at least five years due to exorbitant base prices, insufficient spectrum, and unavailability of newer bands. COAI’s Director Rajan Mathews said that not only is the price tag of the spectrum is expensive for the industry, but even the quantum of airwaves was also insufficient since the industry was seeking 100MHz per operator. Against the 300 MHz that was originally intended to be made available, space and defence departments have been seeking to stake a claim on cumulative 125 MHz possibly leaving only 175 MHz for all 5G aspirants. Additionally, the body had earlier pointed out that 5G is overpriced by at least 30% to 40% compared to international standards and auction in other markets such as South Korea and the U.S.

In this environment, the Bank is continuing to deploy efforts to support its employees, its clients, and the community," said Louis Vachon, President and Chief Executive Officer of National Bank of Canada. "While it's still too early to predict how the COVID-19 pandemic will affect the economy in the long term, the Bank is in a strong position with a solid balance sheet, defensive positioning, quality credit portfolios, and a prudent approach to provisioning.ʺ

So the vast majority of that to go number are products which we are either developing or has in-house relative to BD relationships. We don't have any inorganic in terms of acquisition of assets of any note. We do of course have some products that we're working on next year that we haven't started or identified that we'll have to have some value to justify the R&D investment next year and the year beyond that could still impact 2025. By and large, when we talk about that $1 billion aspiration, it is anchored on products that we have identified, have signed agreements or internally developing. But of course do require the success in some of those larger and more durable assets with the partners that use more sophisticated technologies, and therefore, fewer players in the market.

Readily available data regarding inflation projection in Nepal suggest that the rate of inflation will average around seven to eight percentage till 2021. Although food-price inflation has increased as a result of the pandemic, overall inflation is forecast to remain steady as decline in non-food price inflation is expected to offset food-price inflation. The premia is calculated based on the difference between the actual exchange rate of the dollar and the exchange rate of the dollar in the black market. Data to this extent pertinent to the black market premia are not available readily. However so, inference of low black market premia can be drawn from the relatively low number of restrictions (with regards to the private sector) in Nepal as compared to episodes of high black market premia in African nations. Likewise, the availability of adequate exchange facilities and mechanisms to curb the existence of black markets for consumer goods itself can be a factor from which such inference can be made.

Josep Maria Bartomeu is treated as a "black sheep" and gets unfair criticism at Barcelona, Ramon Calderon has said.
 Bartomeu is under fire at Camp Nou after Lionel Messi asked to leave the Blaugrana at the end of a hugely disappointing season.
 The six-time Ballon d'Or winner's transfer request followed Barca's humiliating 8-2 Champions League defeat to eventual winners Bayern Munich.
 But Calderon, who previously served as president at rivals Real Madrid, has sympathy for Bartomeu, whose position is up for election in March.
 "Being sat in this chair is very difficult," Calderon told Stats Perform News. "It is much more difficult than what people can imagine.
 "There are so many critics and yet, when things go well, the praise is for players and managers. It is normal that the president is the black sheep.
 "This is the person who is accused of not signing a player or letting a player who fans consider important for the team leave. I don't like it.
 "I don't have the information [to properly analyse], but I think Bartomeu has been a good president. From what I see and from what I know of him, I think he is a good president.
 "It is very complicated. Even more so in this time when the team start to lose and get that humiliating defeat. The fans don't forgive."
 Attempting to explain Bartomeu's actions, Calderon added: "As all presidents do, he has looked for the best for the club.
 "Whatever he has done or said, I am sure it has always been for good and trying to get the best for the club he represents."

First up, a movie fan and LEGO builder at the YouTube channel Joebor1777 took a memorable scene from _Knives Out_ and recreated it with LEGO minifigures and bricks. The scene in question follows Chris Evans as Ransom as he informs the rest of his despicable family that he'd been removed from the will of their father before his death, and then proceeds to tell them to eat shit.

"We could see storm surge heights more than 15 feet in some areas," Stewart said. "What doesn't get blown down by the wind could easily get knocked down by the rising ocean waters pushing well inland."
 Laura grew nearly 70% in power in just 24 hours to reach Category 3 status, with maximum sustained winds around 115 mph (185 kph) on Wednesday morning. It was about 280 miles (450 kilometers) out from Lake Charles, Louisiana, moving northwest at 15 mph (24 kph).
 Top winds of 130 mph (209 kmh) are now predicted before landfall, pushing water onto more than 450 miles (724 kilometers) of coast from Texas to Mississippi.
 "Heed the advice of your local authorities. If they tell you to go, go! Your life depends on it today," said Joel Cline, tropical program coordinator at the National Weather Service. "It's a serious day and you need to listen to them."
 Hurricane warnings were issued from San Luis Pass, Texas, to Intracoastal City, Louisiana, and reached inland for 200 miles (322 kilometers). Storm surge warnings were in effect from Freeport, Texas, to the mouth of the Mississippi River.
 A Category 4 hurricane can cause damage so catastrophic that power outages may last for months in places, and wide areas could be uninhabitable for weeks or months, posing a new disaster relief challenge for a government already straining to deal with the coronavirus pandemic.
 "We need to be concerned about the federal capacity to respond to a major hurricane disaster, particularly in light of failings that are all too obvious in the public health area," said Kathleen Tierney, former director of the Natural Hazards Center at the University of Colorado. "I really worry: Who's minding the store?"
 In the largest U.S. evacuation during this pandemic era, more than half a million people were ordered Tuesday to flee from their homes near the Texas- Louisiana state line, including the Texas cities of Beaumont, Galveston and Port Arthur, and the low-lying Calcasieu and Cameron parishes in southwestern Louisiana, where forecasters said storm surge topped by waves could submerge whole communities.
 A National Weather Service meteorologist in Lake Charles, Louisiana -- in the bullseye of Laura's projected path -- took to Facebook Live to deliver an urgent warning for people living south of Interstate 10 in southwest Louisiana and southeast Texas. "Your life will be in immediate and grave danger beginning this evening if you do not evacuate," Donald Jones said.
 Laura also is expected to quickly dump massive rainfall as it moves inland, causing widespread flash flooding in states far from the coast. Flash flood watches were issued for much of Arkansas, and forecasters said heavy rainfall could move to parts of Missouri, Tennessee and Kentucky late Friday, Laura is so powerful that it's expected to become a tropical storm again, menacing the northeastern United States, once it reaches the Atlantic Ocean.

First off, it's important to note that a stock split will not, by any means, make Apple's stock more attractive. While shares will be one-fourth of the price they were before the stock split, they will also each have one-fourth of the business ownership they had previously. Investors, therefore, shouldn't buy Apple stock after the split on the premise that shares will be "cheaper" or because they think shares suddenly have more upside potential than they did before.

And so when we look at those deferral clients, as Neil said, they have a very high FICO, which indicates just a strong willingness to pay and they have a very low LTV on average. So we have an LTV in the kind of mid-50%. And so the clients having -- being distressed is going to be a critical challenge, but our ability to work with them and work with the equity that they have in their homes, work with the income they have, even it is diminished to make sure that we can reset and reprofile kind of a lending situation that works for them, but is also still consistent with our lending standards and appetite. Really, it's going to be critical to helping prevent kind of the pieces I think you're really worrying about and concerning yourself, which I think we all worry about at the end of the day.

"Ironically, Investissement Québec, to win the sale & investor solicitation process, must extend an additional $ 300 million!"

The “American carnage” for blue-collar workers in the post-manufacturing economy proves that the decline of the manufacturing sector is nothing to celebrate. But for many, this doesn’t matter, because automation and offshoring will sap American jobs from the factory floor regardless, even as the remaining factories are highly productive. Many economists and policymakers think that these processes are inevitable, and so, while celebration is inappropriate, we must resign ourselves to our fate.

Think of white dots as a different type of split end, or perhaps even a precursor to your "standard" split ends: They may not be your classic “Y” frays, but they signify just as much damage has been done to the strand, and runs the risk of continuing the split further up the shaft. If you do notice some white dots speckling your ends, best to snip them off and reevaluate your hair care habits. At the end of the day, damage is damage, and no treatment but a trim can mend the strands.

On the same day, the Civil Service Race Forum, a group which coordinates BAME networks across the civil service, tweeted an official statement giving its “unequivocal support for the global Black Lives Matter movement”. For good measure, the Civil Service Race Forum also quoted Marxist academic Angela Davis enjoining people to fight their “racist society” by being “anti-racist”, blamed systemic racism for disparities in UK policing and Covid-19 lockdown fines, and retweeted #BlackLivesMatter on 28 June. Another civil service network for boosting the careers of BAME staff, called “Race to the Top G6/7“, used its Twitter feed to endorse #BlackLivesMatter on 29 May, 13 June, 23 June, 13 July and 17 July.

SC in a closed hearing on January 16 dismissed Airtel, Vodafone Idea and Tata Teleservices' plea that they had filed back in November asking the court for a review of its October AGR ruling. Airtel and VIL have said they are likely to file curative petitions with January 23 due date impending in sight. The rejection to extend any help to carriers could potentially lead to a two player industry, analysts believe. VIL being left in the lurch could be seeing exiting the industry as KM Birla has previously said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Tariff revisions are believed to take the sector towards recovery, however, more clarity on where exactly the industry will be headed to will come post January 23 deadline of paying AGR compensation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Additionally, ahead of the Union budget coming on February 1, the industry which is being weighed down by multiple taxes and levies has reportedly asked the government for aid in the form of reduction of regulatory levies, taxes and license fees with lower interest rates to access credit. Demands for removal of GST from license fee and spectrum usage charges have also been made.

“We’re honoured to be part of the Summit and excited about teaming up with GFX & lablaco, our shared love of clothes and the importance of keeping them in the loop for longer is a common goal we are both striving for,” said Salwa Alireza, Senior Global Brand Manager Home Care at Unilever. “Comfort has been caring for clothes for over 50 years, so it’s no surprise that we care how clothes are treated and where they end up ‘Not in landfills’, but back into the fashion cycle to either be loved again by someone new or to be redesigned.

Hours after landfall, Laura was still a Category 2 hurricane, with maximum sustained winds of 110 mph (175 kph). Its center was past Lake Charles, moving north at about 15 mph (24 kph), but with damaging winds that stretched over much of Louisiana and parts of eastern Texas.
 More than 580,000 coastal residents were ordered to join the largest evacuation since the coronavirus pandemic began and many did, filling hotels and sleeping in cars since officials didn’t want to open mass shelters and worsen the spread of COVID-19.
 But in Cameron Parish, where Laura came ashore, officials said at least 150 people refused pleas to leave and planned to weather the storm in everything from elevated homes to recreational vehicles. The result could be deadly since forecasters said the parish could be completely covered by ocean water.
 “It’s a very sad situation,” said Ashley Buller, assistant director of emergency preparedness. “We did everything we could to encourage them to leave.”
 Becky Clements, 56, didn’t take chances; she evacuated from Lake Charles after hearing that it could take a direct hit. With memories of the destruction almost 15 years ago by Hurricane Rita, she and her family found an Airbnb hundreds of miles inland.
 “The devastation afterward in our town and that whole corner of the state was just awful,” Clements recalled Wednesday. “Whole communities were washed away, never to exist again.”
 Forecasters expected a weakened Laura to cause widespread flash flooding in states far from the coast. After turning eastward and reaching the Atlantic Ocean, it could again become a tropical storm and threaten the Northeast.
 Laura hit the U.S. after killing nearly two dozen people on the island of Hispaniola, including 20 in Haiti and three in the Dominican Republic, where it knocked out power and caused intense flooding.
 Laura was the seventh named storm to strike the U.S. this year, setting a new record for U.S. landfalls by the end of August. The old record was six in 1886 and 1916, according to Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach.

Ramon Calderon expects Barcelona to agree a reduced fee for the transfer of "priceless" captain Lionel Messi.
 Messi has asked to leave Barca - his only senior club - after a difficult season at Camp Nou in which they failed to win a trophy amid tension between the board and the talismanic forward.
 The 33-year-old has a clause in his contract that allows him to terminate his deal and leave the club for free at the end of each season.
 It is claimed Messi intends to activate this clause, yet Barca reportedly believe the option has already expired for this year, despite the 2019-20 season having been prolonged by the coronavirus pandemic.
 Rival clubs would otherwise have to pay €700million to release Messi from his contract, a fee that would appear beyond any suitor between the demands of Financial Fair Play and the impact of the global crisis.
 But Calderon, the former Real Madrid president, is confident Josep Maria Bartomeu will accept a compromise.
 "I am pretty sure they will reach a friendly agreement," Calderon told Stats Perform News. "They have had 20 years together.
 "Messi has given his best for Barcelona, and Barcelona have given their all to Messi. They have won many titles together. He has won six Ballons d'Or.
 "I am convinced they will not go for a legal fight and they will solve it in a friendly way. It would be what I would try, and I am sure Bartomeu [as Barcelona president] will do the same.
 "I know him. He is a calm man, and he will look for the best solution for both. There is no need to go for any legal fight or any controversy."
 Messi's significant wage packet represents another stumbling block, but Calderon believes the forward offers value for money – even if a cut-price deal with Barca might be required.
 Juventus paid just €100m to Madrid for Messi's great rival Cristiano Ronaldo two years ago, a fee Calderon considers a relative bargain.
 "Obviously, I would be enthusiastic if I was the president of any club who can sign [Messi]," Calderon said. "It is true he is 33, but I am sure he has still three or four years at his best level ahead of him.
 "Having said that, how can you pay for him? Real Madrid gave a gift selling Cristiano Ronaldo for €100m because he is showing he is still really valuable and will be for another couple of years.
 "I don't know – [the fee] is something that has to be fixed. I am sure nobody will pay €700m, but that will not be the point.
 "I am also sure Messi will try to get any fee for Barcelona. How many million? I honestly don't know.
 "The club who sign him will be lucky but also will have a huge salary to be paid. He really deserves it, though. The value he adds to a team is priceless."

Both party conventions are taking place against this background of ideological politics. The Democratic National Convention (at least as seen from a beach in Croatia via the Internet) was a marvelous exercise in deception and distraction. Its policy proposals are a wish-list of progressive panaceas, from lax border control to a $2 trillion program for closing down America’s energy industries in the faint hope of halting and reversing climate change. (That’s correct: 2 _trillion_ , not 2 billion.) But it was staged as a homespun gingham fellowship program of good feelings that united all Americans and all immigrants against the pantomime villain Donald Trump, with the added bonus that the immigrants were even more American than the Americans. To place it in ideological terms, a Marxisant progressive program was presented as a conservative one fronted by an amiable unthreatening liberal. A brilliant concept for a great show, but the early returns suggest that it hasn’t convinced the hicks in the sticks.

Hi, guys. It's David Haberle on behalf of Chris Rolland. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess to dig in a little further on the 5G base station side, we appreciate the magnitude of this opportunity for you guys. We wanted to ask how the current attach rate is for CDRs in 5G and what sort of revenue you're generating from CDR versus PMD at this point? Do they like sort of go hand in hand? Or are we still waiting on some of the CDR ramp? Any color there would be great.

ATLANTA — How to rebuild trust in Georgia communities between police officers and local residents was a focus of talks Tuesday between representatives from metro Atlanta law enforcement agencies, the U.S. Attorney’s Office and the state chapter of the NAACP.
 Spearheaded by U.S. Attorney BJay Pak of the Northern District of Georgia, the virtual town hall-style talk touched on how officer-involved shootings are investigated, what can be done to improve officer training and the impact of calls for reduced police funding in local communities across the country.
 “We have to acknowledge that right now we’re hurting,” Pak said. “We have to show some empathy and some patience, condemn the violence and talk to each other to find a common solution that all of us can agree with and buy into.”
 The talk was held amid a backdrop of continuing protests against police brutality and racial injustice sparked by the officer-caused killing of George Floyd in Minnesota in late May and the local arrests of two men involved in the February shooting death of Ahmaud Arbery near Brunswick.
 Protesters have also decried the fatal shooting of Rayshard Brooks by an Atlanta police officer in June shortly after nationwide protests gained steam. His killing prompted the resignation of Atlanta’s police chief at the time.
 And new protests broke out in Kenosha, Wis., Sunday night after 29-year-old Jacob Blake was shot in the back by police while trying to get into his SUV as his three children inside the vehicle looked on.
 Several communities nationwide have pressed for reducing funds for local police departments in recent months, marking a policy that has drawn sharp denouncement from many politicians including President Donald Trump.
 James Woodall, president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People’s Georgia chapter, said the conversation around police funding requires more nuance than a wholesale call for fewer law enforcement dollars.
 He said funding should be driven by local decisions based on the needs of individual communities, not by political talking points on either side of the partisan divide.
 “We have to be having these conversations about what’s happening on the ground and not listen to the national voices and the national movements that are trying to underwrite what’s actually happening at the grassroots level,” Woodall said.
 Chief Rodney Bryant, who now heads the Atlanta Police Department in an interim capacity, said he disagrees with efforts to reduce police funding given the increased resources departments like his will need to improve training. But he agreed funding decisions should be kept strictly at the local level.
 “I think it’s important to recognize that it should lie with the community itself to make that determination,” Bryant said.
 Bryant added he aims to have Atlanta officers evaluated more regularly to identify potential training shortcomings and to incorporate peer intervention in training programs so that it is ingrained in officers to report misconduct from their colleagues, rather than turn a blind eye for fear of being ostracized.
 “You will have to do it,” Bryant said of peer intervention. “And if you don’t, you will be held accountable.”
 Bryant also backed efforts by state lawmakers to evaluate whether Georgia’s citizen’s arrest law should be changed, calling it “a very dangerous situation for both parties, especially when it goes wrong.”
 Chief James Conroy, who heads up the Roswell Police Department, echoed remarks from others during Tuesday’s talk that local jurisdictions need more recourse to assist persons with mental health issues via professional services, rather than by calling police.
 To that end, Conroy also highlighted the importance for citizens to involve themselves more in community engagement in order to better partner with law enforcement agencies and identify specific, local points of improvement for police to make.
 “Relationships are the key to successful and effective law enforcement,” Conroy said. “If we don’t have strong relationships with our community built on trust and transparency, we’re going to fail.”
 Cobb County District Attorney Joyette Holmes, whose office is prosecuting the two men arrested in the Arbery fatal shooting, noted communication between law enforcement and many different community groups is critical to build trust between officers and residents.
 “It really takes all of us recognizing what our blind spots are,” Holmes said.      ---

Abbott Labs has become the focus of Thursday's rolling coronavirus coverage, as the FDA's approval - coming just days after the whole patient plasma approval controversy - of Abbott's 15-minute rapid COVID-19 test - which will be priced at just $5 a pop - has quelled fears about falling testing numbers along the sun belt. Now, parts of the country where test turnaround times still lag finally have a solid chance of getting up to speed.

Penn meets the latter criteria. Amid uncertainty as to when a Covid-19 vaccine will be available and airlines will restore routes, Las Vegas is in a rough spot for the time being. However, that doesn’t mean folks aren’t gambling. Companies that operate many casinos in the U.S. outside of Las Vegas, including Penn, say those venues have been performing well in recent months. In other words, if gamblers can drive to casinos, they’ll go to them.But most people won’t visit casinos if they have to fly to do so.

Good afternoon, guys. I have a few. I want to start with glargine. Tim, what are your thoughts on interchangeability for glargine as a gating factor for success? I know Mylan is seeking it, we don't know if they'll get it. Lilly is doing a great job with the product, but that's because they have branded infrastructure and contracting, etc. So it remains to be seen how important interchangeability would be for success and achieving numbers like you suggested. So can you talk about the importance of interchangeability and how that's factored into your thinking and whether you believe it to be important or not?

So we've noted before that we've been quite impressed with the FDA's ability to maintain their engagement and review of products in particular. I think that has been undeterred by the crisis. They have successfully moved much of their work remote as have we and as much of the industry has and that continues fairly unabated. In fact, they seem to be making a point of getting more approvals out than ever, which is good at the end of the day when you're a company like us that's trying to launch a lot of new products to our portfolio.

For all the disasters that Peronism has left in its wake, there are no signs that it will be disappearing from the Argentine political system anytime soon. For Peronism, power is a business that has enriched leaders and trade unionists for more than 70 years. It’s too good a business to give up, at least for as long as so many Argentines are, for one reason or another, still prepared to support it -- and they are. In 2019, they voted against the reelection of Mauricio Macri, who had tried to take the country down a different route, and opted instead for the election of Alberto Fernández and his vice president, none other than, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner. This was despite, in the latter’s case, charges of massive corruption and a preliminary judicial finding that a memorandum of understanding that Kirchner had signed with Iran had in effect been an agreement to cover up Iranian involvement in a 1994 terrorist bombing. The deal was struck, allegedly, in exchange for access to oil and, supposedly, other benefits. As vice president, she will be immune from prosecution.

Moreover, one of the leading COVID-19 vaccine candidates in the U.S. is an mRNA vaccine, a type of vaccine never before approved anywhere in the world. Using the EUA pathway on such previously untested and unproved technology would be risky. This is even more concerning in light of the FDA's recent track record of issuing EUAs with little or no data and recasting test results as wholesome without proper support.

“He always -- him and my mom -- helped out,” she said. “He was a humble man never wanting recognition from the faith he passed on.”
 Helping others, however, led to his death on Oct. 26, 2018 after his schizophrenic grandson, Jonathan Weaver, kidnapped, attacked and killed him.
 “My daddy lost his life doing what he was called to do and that was helping others,” Dial said. “It was and still is a struggle, but I just get up and this has helped me get back my faith.”
 Dial said she had a tough time reconciling the aforementioned events with her faith, even saying it almost pushed her over the edge. Helping others, like her father, brought her back.
 She said her father was of Christian faith and helped others out the kindness in his heart and the biblical admonition to honor thy father. Taking a tip from him, Dial is honoring her father through her generosity.
 “I just want to keep his memory alive and this is going to do that for me,” she said.
 Dial is already preparing for another donation, this time to the Serenity House. She also makes bags for homeless people which includes necessities like toothpaste, toothbrushes, deodorant, water, etc. -- things they could use.
 “My kids at one time were homeless so that kind of hit home for me,” she said. “My daddy was a full believer that you don’t walk away, you help.”
 Her goal right now is to also find some families by Christmas time who don’t normally get to enjoy the holiday, and give them that luxury.
 “Whatever I can do -- I mean it’s not a lot — but it’s going to put a smile on a kid’s face,” she said.

“We had planned for a three-month break even. Under normal circumstances, it would have been a one-month break even, but we extended it to three. We figured that we knew what the circumstances were when we closed the deal. We made a few changes and could float for three months, but at the end of June, we were out of money. We made an 11th hour deal with the landlord to go through July and into August. If we could have broke even, we could have kept going.”

Messi’s first contract with the club was signed on a napkin after a lunch between his representatives and club officials nearly 20 years ago, but it was with a burofax — a certified communication method commonly used in Spain, similar to a telegram — that Messi told the club he wants to leave.

Okay. And then, Tim, understanding that you just announced a restructuring to generate $15 million of cost savings that was mostly at the Seymour plant. If the business continues to see pressure on the top-line, how much additional flexibility do you have with opex or any of your other facilities? Did you go down to the bone or do you think that there is still room potentially to cut If you need to?

The resin of micronized PTFE is employed in a broad range of industries such as grease and lubricant, elastomers, ink, coating, and thermoplastic. The demand for coating is expected to gain momentum in the coming years owing to rising expenditure in infrastructural development and growing disposable income of the middle class consumer. This, in turn, is expected to benefit the global micronized PTFE market in the long run. The top drawer companies can also capitalize on the opportunities arising from the developments in terms of technology and infrastructure taking place in the Asia Pacific region.

"We are floating with love and wonder from the safe and healthy arrival of our daughter," Katy and Orlando told us.? ? "But we know we're the lucky ones and not everyone can have a birthing experience as peaceful as ours was. Communities around the world are still experiencing a shortage of healthcare workers and every eleven seconds a pregnant woman or newborn dies, mostly from preventable causes. Since COVID-19 many more newborn lives are at risk because of the increased lack of access to water, soap, vaccines and medicines that prevent diseases. As parents to a newborn, this breaks our hearts, as we empathize with struggling parents now more than ever.? ? "As UNICEF Goodwill Ambassadors, we know UNICEF is there, on the ground, doing whatever it takes to make sure every expecting mother has access to a trained health worker and access to quality healthcare. In celebration of the heart we know our daughter already has, we have set up a donation page to celebrate DDB's arrival. By supporting them, you are supporting a safe start to life and reimagining a healthier world for every child. We hope your [R] can bloom with generosity.? ? Gratefully-? ? Katy & Orlando."? ?

I'll say that we have certainly been concentrating on SAP right now because there is a change there and change creates opportunities. The other company that we, it was kind of for up for grabs and we see a lot of replacements and against would be the in-force we are looking at on those is getting old and ready to getting replaced and taking competitive opportunity against them. The market is certainly a lot smaller and competitive than it used to be. Thanks.

One of the most effective ways to stand out in a saturated market is by doing something few others are doing. VR and AR are new technologies that the majority of social platforms are encouraging. This is a great opportunity for early adaptors to take advantage of a way to not only stand out from the crowd, but also embrace its advantages. Our company started placing GoPro MAX devices around our production sets to give clients the experience of being physically there during the shoot without having to leave their home or office. We are giving them unprecedented access to move around as they please without interfering with our production and taking up space. In this day and age, I can't imagine a better value-add for our clients that is also embraced by our crew internally. Welcome to the future! - Jacob Tanur, Click Play Films

Incorporating AR and VR in your branding strategy is more important now than ever before. As everything moves virtual (like conferences, networking events, etc.), it's important to develop the right virtual presence that can be equally immersive for your audience, and a simple landing page won't do that. Brands are beginning to explore the creation of virtual conference booths, interactive 360-degree viewing rooms and AR experiences that clients can share around the globe. One high-impact way to get on board would be to add a VR experience or 360-degree viewing room to your own website so that you can be ready to participate in the next virtual exhibit hall that most notable conferences are already spinning up. - Amy Balliett, Killer Visual Strategies

Bănel Nicoliță (35 ani) a confirmat, după mult timp, zvonul despărțirii de soția sa. Fostul star de la FCSB a anunțat că divorțul s-a produs în februarie, deși el și Cristina erau separați de doi ani. Zvonurile divorțului au apărut în 2019 și erau alimentate de faptul că cei doi nu mai fuseseră văzuți împreună de o lungă perioadă de timp. În plus, se pare că soția lui Bănel Nicoliță ar fi fost deranjată de comportamentul partenerului ei. La vremea aceea, mai multe publicații tabloide susțineau că fostul fotbalist stă mai mult la distracție decât acasă, cu familia.”Ne-am cunoscut în Brăila, acum 6 ani de zile. Mi s-a părut un băiat cumsecade. Eu nu știam că joacă la Steaua. Mi-am dat seama că e cineva cunoscut, după reacția celor din jur”, mărturisea Cristina, fosta soție, în ziua nunții, în 2013.Bănel Nicoliță și Cristina au împreună doi copii.

So in Japan, the reimbursement based on pharmacoeconomics and the healthcare costs is sort of as a rule of thumb for most drugs of the order, say, 50% of what one would expect to see in the U.S. And having seen that and having seen the market adoption that has occurred in the last three years in Japan, which has ultimately resulted in the requirement for JCR to expand their manufacturing capabilities, in other words, they underestimated the demand. Putting those two together gives us pretty clear line of sight around how we see the rollout and the revenue generation, and the number of patients that are likely to adopt this treatment for which if we get approval, we'll be the only approved therapy for children under 12. I'm not sure how specific I can be beyond that, but I think that's the way we see the rollout for pediatric GVHD.

According to Pro Football Focus, Savage allowed a reception every 33.3 coverage snaps last season -- which was the lowest rate for Green Bay. He's a rising star in this league, and I expect him to make his first Pro Bowl appearance this year. The pass rush the Smith brothers provide coupled with his talented teammates in the secondary -- I really do believe you're going to see Savage make a big jump in Year 2.
 ## 3\. Packers go 11-5, repeat as NFC North champions
 Earlier this offseason, I predicted all 16 games on the Packers' 2020 schedule. I think we all can agree that Green Bay's docket is a bit tougher this season, so an 11-5 record would be a huge success. If you think this win total prediction is high, you are not alone. Sure, I guess you could say I'm higher on the Packers than Vegas or other NFC North fans are, but if this team can remain healthy, build on what they accomplished last year and find success with Brown, they should be right back in the postseason. With nine wins being the over/under, I'm going to go ahead and take the over. The Packers went undefeated in the NFC North last season, and I believe they go 5-1 in 2020 -- which is still good enough for a division title. LaFleur will again be in the running for AP NFL Coach of the Year -- and I think he has a good chance of winning it as well.

But this course of affairs is _not_ inevitable. Both automation and offshoring have been fundamentally misunderstood by a large section of the commentariat. In reality, despite the pundits’ resignation, the American manufacturing sector can meaningfully increase its share of employment.

But in Cameron Parish, where Laura came ashore, Nungesser said 50 to 150 people refused pleas to leave and planned to weather the storm in everything from elevated homes to recreational vehicles. The result could be deadly, since some houses weren’t raised high enough to withstand the massive storm surge.

Singer Madison Beer has opened up to fans about her past struggles with self harm. Posting on her Instagram Stories late last night, Beer showed followers that she was marking a year "clean of self-harm," with a screenshot of the date marked in her calendar, commenting that "No one around me really knew I was struggling".
 Beer posted a series of pictures to her Instagram Stories on Wednesday night marking the milestone, starting with a picture that showed the date marked in her calendar, along with a trigger warning she wrote;
 "As of today I am officially one year clean of self harm. I never thought I'd be able to say this & I am so proud of myself, it has been a uphill battle, so whether you think you might b one day, one week, one month, or one year clean - I'm so proud of you."
 In another story she said, "i'd also like to add... no one around me relly knew i was struggling when i was. i hid not only my self harm, but my pain from the world."
 She continued, "please please please do not ignore the signs if you think someone you know might be struggling. reach out to your friends. u truly never know what does on behind closed doors."

 He retired from Case International where he worked in sales management.
   
 He was an active member of Grand View United Methodist Church in Dubuque, where he volunteered on a regular basis. Bill enjoyed hit & miss engines, farming, breakfast with the men's church group, joking around, and spending time with his family and friends. He was also a proud Republican.
   
 Survivors include his wife, Barb; two daughters, Sarah (Bradley) VanZee of Farmington, MO, and Stephanie Yager of Dubuque; two grandsons, Arie VanZee, and Elias VanZee; one brother, Alan (Connie) Yager of Geneseo, IL; one sister, Kathryn Brown of Chicago, IL; and several nieces and nephews.

Richmond landed a blow over an AFL premiership rival by securing a 27-point win over West Coast at Metricon Stadium on Thursday night.
 The Tigers flexed their muscle in the third quarter with a decisive four-goal burst to claim a hard-fought 14.4 (88) to 9.7 (61) win.
 The victory was the third-placed Tigers' fifth from their past six matches, while defeat ended an eight-game winning run for the Eagles.
 "It's really coming into the fire in the belly time of the season we're you've just got to start to consolidate your spot in the eight," satisfied Tigers coach Damien Hardwick said.
 "I thought we probably did that a little bit tonight.
 "What I will say is West Coast are a great side.
 "Did they play their best tonight? No, they didn't, and we're probably a little bit the same.
 "I think both of us have got significant areas of improvement that we'll look at, and we'll continue to get better."
 Richmond forward Tom Lynch kicked three goals but it was a moment of inspiration by Dustin Martin which sparked a third-quarter surge.
 The superstar midfielder kicked a remarkable banana from the pocket after West Coast youngster Jarrod Brander's awful shank out on the full gave the Tigers possession.
 After Martin's goal, Richmond kicked three more unanswered to open up a 29-point lead.
 Jack Darling's three goals in the third quarter kept hope alive for the Eagles, including a kick after the siren which was his 400th AFL major and reduced the deficit to 14 points.
 The Tigers halted the Eagles momentum with the first two goals of the final term, including a long bomb from Noah Balta from outside 50 to seal the battle of the winners of the past three grand finals.
 "I thought we had a swing," Eagles coach Adam Simpson said.
 "We played a really good side in Richmond and they pressured us really well ... I thought the endeavour and spirit was there with our players and unfortunately we weren't good enough tonight but we got beaten by a pretty good side."
 Liam Ryan also kicked three goals for the Eagles in somewhat of a lone hand in the forward line.
 His performance was telling after Josh Kennedy was ruled out in the first quarter with a concussion - the key forward caught a knee in the head from Balta as the Tigers utility rose to spoil a ball.
 Richmond had their own injury concerns with Dylan Grimes limping out of the match in the second quarter with a hamstring problem.
 Martin finished with two goals and 17 possessions, while Bachar Houli (23 possessions) and skipper Trent Cotchin (26 possessions) were busy for the Tigers.
 Eagles midfielder Andrew Gaff topped the disposals tally with 32 while captain Luke Shuey had 27 disposals.
 The Tigers take on Fremantle on Wednesday while fifth-placed West Coast's next match is on Tuesday against Essendon.

 “He has stolen her innocence. A four-year-old should not even know about these things and I felt powerless to stop it.
 “I feel embarrassed and humiliated that I let him look after my daughter. I thought about moving away but why should I uproot my child?
 “This has been the longest 11 months of my life and I need to find some justice and closure. It will take a long time to get over this.
 “I feel guilty and I’ve been blamed for what happened.”

He was also in charge of the India U-13 and the Pailan Arrows from 2011 to 2012.
 "Sukhi-sir is one of the most deserving coaches to win the award. Congratulations Sukhvinder Ji! He was also the one to give me my first match as India captain. I will always be grateful to him for that," former captain Bhaichung Bhutia said.
 Former India star Renedy Singh, who made his international debut under Sukhwinder, said the coach from Punjab was "arguably one of the most successful Indian coaches for the national team".
 "Sukhwinder sir was the coach under whom I made my national team debut. He really turned our team around from one that used to lose by a big margin against sides like Malaysia to a team that could give a tough fight to some of the best Asian teams like UAE and Uzbekistan," said Renedy.
 The former India winger said Sukhwinder made the players see the bigger picture, no matter whether the team wins or loses.
 "Even after the famous win against UAE in Bangalore, he said we should stay calm and not go overboard with our celebrations. We had a crucial game coming up against Yemen, and we needed to focus on that," said Renedy.
 "That was a really great quality in him. Once the game is over, you shift your focus to the next one. He used to tell us that football is always about getting ready for the next game."

 Another former India captain Bruno Coutinho believes that India''s performance improved when Sukhwinder was at the helm of affairs.
 "The Dhyan Chand Award is a great honour for someone like him. He was a great coach, technically very sound. What was great about him was that he enhanced our performance, and under his guidance, we did really well," said Coutinho.

The toys and stuffed animals will be put into a closet for children to pick from after finishing a forensic interview. For most of the children, this chance to pick a toy is a powerful experience, Dismuke said.
 “When a child comes here, it’s normally because of a traumatic experience that they had to go through,” she said. “When they leave with something, it’s a comforting item that they find [and] leave here with.”
 It’s something to take home, to have in their hand -- to cherish -- as they deal with issues they may face behind closed doors. At times, it can be a saving grace.
 “People don’t think about it, but these animals are their security,” Dismuke said. “It’s almost like a weight lifted off their shoulders when they leave.”
 And that’s what Dial is looking to give to others. Her efforts, under the name “A Rose From An Angel,” is not to become a non-profit, rather to give from her heart.
 It’s inspired by her father’s philosophy “Just one rose will do.”
 Her father, Billy May, used to bring a freshly cut rose from his garden to each of the patients at a local nursing home, she said. He always said, “Just one rose would do,” in order to bring a smile to someone’s face.
 But through May’s actions, the rose became more of a symbol for helping others. When a young girl couldn’t afford glasses, he put her family in touch with the Lion’s Club to get them.
 He catered to and took care of his grand- and great-grandchildren who have special needs, Dial said.

With consumers apprehensive about going to physical stores and fitting rooms closed, contactless and touchless innovations have accelerated as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on retail. Virtual dressing rooms are growing in popularity as retailers attempt to re-create the try-on experience and give an added boost of confidence for online shopping decisions. The beauty world was an early adapter that successfully implemented virtual try-on technology with leading brands like Mac Cosmetics and Sephora. And while we’ve seen innovation in fitting rooms like interactive mirrors over the past several years, it’s gone from a nice-to-have to a need in the dawn of contactless apparel shopping. Israel-based tech firm Zeekit is proving to be a leader in augmented reality technology, allowing users to upload a full-length body photo to try on clothes. Zeekit is working with Macy’s, Adidas, and Modcloth and they’ve also extended their capabilities with ASOS to provide virtual photo shoots. True Fit is another data-driven personalization platform for retailers including Levis and Ralph Lauren that maps fit, style preference, and size for millions of shoppers. Even mall developer Brookfield Properties is getting in on the action as they attempt to lure shoppers this Fall with the body scanning capabilities of Fit:Match. American department store chain Kohl’s dipped into virtual tech this Spring by teaming up with Snapchat on an augmented reality virtual closet. Kohl’s smartly shifted their virtual assortment to loungewear in the midst of the pandemic. While some of these innovations were in the works prior to COVID-19, it’s clear that leveraging touchless fitting advancements provides a way for consumers to feel secure and more confident in online purchases.

Welcome to the world, Daisy Dove Bloom! We are honoured to introduce Goodwill Ambassadors @KatyPerry and @OrlandoBloom’s new bundle of joy.⠀ ⠀ “We are floating with love and wonder from the safe and healthy arrival of our daughter,” Katy and Orlando told us.⠀ ⠀ “But we know we’re the lucky ones and not everyone can have a birthing experience as peaceful as ours was. Communities around the world are still experiencing a shortage of healthcare workers and every eleven seconds a pregnant woman or newborn dies, mostly from preventable causes. Since COVID-19 many more newborn lives are at risk because of the increased lack of access to water, soap, vaccines and medicines that prevent diseases. As parents to a newborn, this breaks our hearts, as we empathize with struggling parents now more than ever.⠀ ⠀ “As UNICEF Goodwill Ambassadors, we know UNICEF is there, on the ground, doing whatever it takes to make sure every expecting mother has access to a trained health worker and access to quality healthcare. In celebration of the heart we know our daughter already has, we have set up a donation page to celebrate DDB’s arrival. By supporting them, you are supporting a safe start to life and reimagining a healthier world for every child. We hope your ♥️ can bloom with generosity.⠀ ⠀ Gratefully-⠀ ⠀ Katy & Orlando.”⠀ ⠀ Please tap the link in our bio to support the most precious gift: a healthy child.

Packaging of pharmaceutical products is considered to be a very crucial element for the pharmaceutical industry because such packaging ensures the quality and safety of drugs that it contains. As such, it is estimated that there will be a constant requirement for pharmaceutical packaging equipment in the industry of pharma. As opposed to the packaging systems that are available in the world today, pharmaceutical packaging equipment are flexible, modern, and automated and it comprises secondary and primary packaging equipment, and serialization and labeling equipment. This helps in the reduction of the time for packaging thereby boosting production.

Now that automation and offshoring are no longer credible culprits for the historic collapse in American manufacturing employment, policymakers have no more excuses. This decline isn’t inevitable -- it’s a choice. The next time you hear that “those jobs aren’t coming back,” hear it for what it is: an abdication of our duty to the millions of Americans who have watched their middle-class aspirations slip away.

PLYMOUTH - Meg Marcel didn't hit a softball until she was 13-year-old but she's quickly made up for lost time. The Plymouth native and recent Archbishop Williams graduate will put her powerful swing up against the top power hitters in the state as part of the inaugural A Shot for Life Home Run Challenge.
 The event will take place over the weekend of Sept. 12 at the Austin Prep School in Reading. Money raised from the event will be donated for ongoing cancer research being conducted by the Dr. Curry Research Laboratory at Massachusetts General Hospital.
 A similar ASFL charity challenge to crown the top boys and girls basketball shooters in the state has been a successful event for the last eight years under the direction of ASFL CEO Mike Slonina. This year 16 softball players and 17 baseball players are in this event two-day event. Each participant was asked to raise $1,000 to compete.
 Plymouth South senior Amelia Freitas, a teammate of Marcel on the Mass Drifters Showcase AAU softball team, will also take part in the contest.
 "I'm honored that I've been asked to take part in this competition," said Marcel, who was settling in over the weekend as an incoming freshman at Bryant University. "It's raising money for a great cause and I get to play the game I love. I jumped at the chance to be a part of this."
 Speaking of jumping, the softball has a tendency to jump off the bat of the 18-year-old, 5'8" right-handed hitter.
 "I can hit the ball with some power," said Marcel, who had a legitimate shot at breaking the Bishops' career home runs record if her senior season had not been canceled by the Coronavirus pandemic. "I've learned that you cannot swing for home runs. You need to make a good swing and get solid contact with the softball and then let the pitcher provide the power."
 That hitting philosophy has served Marcel very well. She was a three-time Central Catholic League All-Star as the starting shortstop with Archbishop Williams and is now a member of the NCAA Division I Bryant University softball program. She will major in Business and carry a minor in Sports Management.
 "I love the campus and everyone was very nice to me when I came here for my visit," Marcel said about the Smithfield, RI university where classes started on Tuesday. "One of my teammates is my roommate and the rest of the softball team is coming in this week. I think we've got a couple weeks of conditioning practices to start and then they'll add on more in a couple weeks as long as everything remains safe."
 Marcel grew up playing baseball in the Plymouth Youth Baseball and Softball league before switching over to softball at the age of 13. The angle the ball comes to you at the plate is one of the bigger differences she encountered in her switch from one sport to the other because the softball comes at you from a lower spot than a baseball, which is thrown over the top.
 "You meet a softball and a baseball at different points in the swing so that was something I had to make some adjustments for," she said.
 The adjustments she made worked out very well for Marcel. She batted .463 as a freshman and came back as a sophomore to club eight homers and 20 RBI. She saw her batting average continue to climb as a junior when she was named a Patriot Ledger, Boston Globe and Boston Herald All-Scholastic.
 Along with choosing a college, Marcel also had to pick what sport she wanted to play at the next level. She played four years with the Bishops girls basketball program, making it to four Division 3 South title games, winning three of them, and she was also a part of two state championship hoop teams.
 "I was playing basketball as soon as I could walk. I thought I was going to be a basketball player when I started high school but softball came along and I grew to love it," Marcel said. "I have some great memories of playing basketball for Archbishop Williams. I'll miss my teammates and (Head Coach Matt Mahoney) was the best to play for but I think it will be better for me now that I can concentrate on playing just one sport."
