There were forced to open on Gold Street, she said, in order to leave the main drag open to white-owned businesses.

So when it comes to Osman, and the Cavaliers as a whole, it’s best to remain patient. Now, that’s asking a lot out of Cleveland fans but this rebuild will be a slow burn for the team. As cliche as it sounds, Cleveland hasn’t been able to land the player to lead them out of the shadow of LeBron James after missing out on Luka Doncic, Trae Young and Zion Williamson due to bad draft lottery luck. That’s totally fine, though since the organization has drafted intelligently and assembled a promising foundation for the future. Osman is a key part of that foundation. No, he isn’t the starting small forward of the future but he is still vital to the team’s future success.

Several large drugmakers including Merck & Co Inc and Pfizer Inc on Thursday unveiled a $1 billion fund to bolster struggling antibiotic companies and sustain a pipeline for new treatments.
 Antibiotic makers have struggled with anemic investment and bankruptcies, even after the approval of new drugs, as fears of drug-resistant microbes force hospitals to adopt a more conservative approach toward such treatments.
 Public health authorities have raised alarms about a looming health crisis, saying deaths from antibiotic-resistant bacteria could dwarf that from the COVID-19 pandemic.
 The fund, led by the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations, seeks to serve as a temporary solution until new legislation can offer a more permanent fix in the market.
 It aims to help shore up investment in smaller biotech companies after several large drugmakers, such as Sanofi SA bowed out of the antibiotics space.
 "The fund is being developed to buy time for the future," said Eli Lilly and Co CEO David Ricks. "We are probably buying 4-5 years of time with this initiative."
 Other companies participating in the fund include Johnson & Johnson, Novartis and GlaxoSmithKline.
 The initiative "gives these biotechs access to the kinds of capabilities that large pharmaceutical companies have, such as manufacturing and regulatory," said Silas Holland, head of external affairs for the fund and director of global public policy at Merck.
 An independent scientific panel will review and recommend funding for companies developing promising novel antibiotics, Holland said. The group's goal is to bring two to four new antibiotics to patients within a decade.

But the celebrity president does not object to having another celebrity on the ballot in November 2020 and then again in November of 2024. “If he did it,” Trump said, “he would have to view this as a trial run for what’s going to happen in four years.”
 It was retweeted more than half a million times, and liked more than a million times.
 But presidential campaigns take time and planning, not just viral moments. Usually candidates begin laying the groundwork years before formally announcing a run. West would have just four months, and for that reason many are tempted to dismiss his political flirtation as a stunt. But his money and his name recognition, combined with political arithmetic, could make him a factor.
 As some have already noted, Trump won his first term with a straight flush and by narrow margins in midwestern states. He won Michigan by 10,000 votes, while election officials recorded nearly 9,000 write-in ballots there. He also won in Wisconsin by 23,000 votes. Meanwhile, voters wrote in the name of another candidate 35,150 times.
 If the rapper actually means what he tweets, then those numbers should make campaigns nervous. The president seemed relaxed Tuesday morning though, and likely with good reason.
 While West has publicly backed Trump in the past, he isn’t likely to steal away many voters on the right. He said in a May 2018 interview with radio host Charlamagne Tha God that his presidency would be a mix of “the Trump campaign, and maybe the Bernie Sanders principles.”
 “I think both are needed,” the rapper added.
 At least in theory, an independent bid by West could also throw the youth vote into flux. While Millennials generally skew Democratic, a vocal contingent has made known its unhappiness with Joe Biden. This bloc could find an alternative in the popular musician, sapping votes away from the left in a close election.
 This would certainly please the president, though he didn’t address any strategic details other than to say that a Kanye West candidacy in 2020 “would be a great trial run.”

 The Rolling Stones have announced a deluxe edition of their 1973 album "Goats Head Soup," a 4-CD boxed set with 10 unreleased tracks and a full concert from the same year. The set is due on Sept. 4.
 The unreleased tracks include the long-bootlegged outtake "Criss Cross" -- which you can hear now below -- as well as several little-known songs like "Scarlet," featuring Led Zeppelin's Jimmy Page on guitar (interestingly, Scarlet is his daughter's name) and Blind Faith bassist Ric Grech, and "All the Rage." It also includes alternate versions and mixes of album tracks "100 Years Ago," "Hide Your Love" and others. The song "Through the Lonely Nights," released as a B-side in 1974, also features Page and seems likely to be included.

Neither writer Mark Bomback, Tyldum nor Simmons had any intention of making Barber out to be “not that bad a guy.” Simmons’ opinion is that Barber is battling for his own soul and for the soul of his son and his grandson. Then again, he’s not completely altruistic either. Barber may be stuck behind bars, but there is a delight in being able to screw with the system through other means.
 “I’ve played some nice guys, and I’ve played some horrific guys, but I’ve never played a character that I couldn’t at least understand on some level what it is that motivates him, and what it is that makes him a human being,” Simmons says. “I’m not saying other actors can’t, but I can’t just play a character if I don’t have some way into understanding his point of view, his perspective. I don’t have to like it or agree with it, I didn’t have to become a sympathizer for the Aryan Brotherhood when I was doing ‘Oz,’ but I had to understand where this guy was coming from, and why he believed what he was doing was right, and that certainly is the case with Billy Barber.”

Unless you're being beckoned by the siren call of Florida or Arizona, the best place to retire might be close to home.
 A new study found that Munster, Highland, Crown Point, LaPorte, Valparaiso and Merrillville ranked among the best places in the state to retire.
 The New York City-based financial technology company SmartAsset ranked Munster as the best place to retire in Indiana. The study looked at tax friendliness, the number of doctors offices, and recreation and social opportunities.
 "First, we looked at state and local tax rates, considering two types of taxes: income and sales. We calculated effective rates based on a retiree earning $35,000 annually from retirement savings, Social Security and part- time employment. We subtracted income taxes paid from the gross income to determine disposable income. Sales taxes paid were calculated based on the disposable income being spent on taxable goods," SmartAsset said in its study. "Next, we determined the number of doctors’ offices, recreation centers and retirement centers per thousand residents in each location. Finally, we measured the number of seniors in each city as a percentage of the total population."

  Coach Ron Rivera said last week he has been speaking with Snyder about Washington's nickname, and the two have even discussed possible replacements. Rivera has mentioned he hopes a new name will honor the military in some way. (As the Post notes, the D.C.-based franchise has long had close ties to the military.)


  "Redtails" would do the trick in that regard, too.

If you've been keeping a healthy distance from other people because of COVID-19, you probably feel smart. But if you're also feeling lonely and stressed, it doesn't mean anything is wrong. It could simply mean you're human.      The need to be around people is hard-wired into our brains, researchers say. We crave company in the same way we hunger for food or thirst for water. When that craving isn't satisfied, the long-term health consequences can be serious.      Luckily, the need for togetherness can be met even at a distance.      The idea that our brains drive us to be around one another has gained popularity in recent decades, said Louise Hawkley, senior research scientist at NORC at the University of Chicago.      We evolved to be around those we know and trust, she said. "Our security was in numbers. We had our safety by being around other people. We weren't particularly fast runners. We couldn't defy what nature threw at us just by speed. We had to be smart about it. Well, one of the smart things we did was we capitalized on each other's brains. We worked together."      As Lane Beckes, an associate professor in the department of psychology at Bradley University in Peoria, Illinois, put it: "We absolutely need other people."      Brain studies have shown how deeply this need is woven into our biology. A study in the journal Science found subjects who were excluded from a virtual ball-tossing game had more activity in the part of the brain that processes physical pain. Recently, researchers published preliminary findings on the preprint server bioRxiv that suggest loneliness triggers chemical responses in the brain similar to what's prompted by hunger.      Other research has shown serious long-term health consequences from chronic loneliness. "It turns out that being socially connected is associated with approximately a 50% reduction in the risk of early death," Beckes said. "In effect, it's similar to the reduction of risk that somebody with coronary heart disease has if they quit smoking."      A 2016 study in the journal Heart linked loneliness and social isolation to a 32% increased risk of having a stroke or developing coronary artery disease.      Beckes was part of research published in the International Journal of Psychophysiology that showed how people facing a threat have lower stress responses when they're physically touching their partners or close friends. But here's an important point for those of us sitting home during the pandemic - it's not the physical company of others that defines loneliness. What matters most is that you feel as if someone has your back.      "It's not being alone," Hawkley said. "It's feeling alone" - a mismatch between what you want and what you need.      Not everybody needs the same level of connectedness, she said. "And it's a good thing, because we need those brave souls who are willing to break away from the group and be the explorers, (who) break new ground, get out there and go where no one has gone before. But there's always got to be this backstop, this return to the safe base that even the explorers need."      That sense of having a base can come in many ways, even without face-to-face contact.      "A lot of people can even live alone and be perfectly fine in part because they do things like they talk to their friends on the phone, they have Zoom conversations, they feel like other people will come to their aid" if they need help, Beckes said.      But there are limits. There's a reason those Zoom conferences feel awkward. Stress, he said, arises when our brains don't know what's happening next. Usually, we're absorbing all sorts of cues from those around us to try to anticipate what's going to happen. The absence of those nonverbal signals makes online connections more stressful.      Which is why he recommends trying to arrange in-person social contact with physical distancing - perhaps a small gathering of friends outside at a park with space between people.      Just don't ignore safety to socialize. "The health effects of loneliness and social isolation probably pale in comparison to an acute outbreak of the COVID-19 virus," Beckes said.      If in-person meetings aren't feasible, improve digital get-togethers. Try playing games online.      "When they have a shared focus, players are thinking about something besides those missing cues," he said. "Anything that sort of reduces the awkwardness and stress of interacting with other people is going to be more rewarding and, ultimately, a better source of satisfying your social need."      Hawkley said taking initiative is key. A review she helped conduct about anti- loneliness techniques that was published in the journal Personality and Social Psychology Review suggested the brains of lonely people get "hijacked" by negative thoughts.      She suggested making a list of people to connect with, perhaps a long-lost friend or a family member. But be deliberate about the decision.      "It may not be the be-all, end-all the first time around," she said. "But you have to find a way of feeding your social need bit by bit. And as you have successful experiences you gain more confidence. And you think, 'Yes, I can do this.'"

Justin Verburg, head brewer at Windmill Brewing in Dyer, came up with the name for the Single Double Tripel before he even made the beer.


  His idea was for a single hop, double IPA, Belgian-style Tripel. The results were better than expected. The beer is now Windmill's best seller.


  The Single Double Tripel is brewed with citra hops, Belgian candy sugar and a Belgian yeast for fermentation.


  "Citra has really good fruit and floral notes without the harsh bitterness," said Verburg, a former homebrewer.


  That's why it goes down remarkably smooth for a beer with 9 percent alcohol. It has notes of tropical and stone fruits on the nose, with a hint of banana and cloves. It finishes sweet with lots of fruit flavors.


  Windmill Brewing, which opened in July, is at 2121 Gettler St. in Dyer. For more information, call (219) 440-2189 or visit windmillbrew.com.

The Seattle district known as CHOP, Capitol Hill Organized Protest, has been occupied by demonstrators and is starting to break up. This is a small community in a City. All successful societies think of the well being of their children 50 to 100 years down the road. The CHOP zones may be the wave of the future and could be a factor here in Utah. Think of the implications of this. In a survey 1 in 3 Californians wish to secede from the U.S. All they need to do is to organize into CHOP zones.
 Now, let’s consider the implications for our Great state of Utah if the CHOP movement craze were to take hold here.
 If Provo wants to become a CHOP theocracy, let it. If the Midvale CHOP wants to have Spanish as its official language, let it. If the Salt Lake CHOP wants all electric cars or no cars at all and Vernal CHOP wants polluting pre-2006 diesels, let them both have their separate ways.
 As the Seattle CHOP has a warlord for its President, this also would produce a great variety of Presidents for the CHOPs of Utah. The Avenues could draft Jim Dabakis as their President. Provo could have whoever is the President of the Church. Vernal may well want oilman Rex Tillerson.
 Seriously, the anger on both sides is so great I’m wondering when the first shot of the second civil war will be fired. The CHOP zones could relieve this stress. Every four to eight years one side abuses the other side and it has become psychologically damaging to us. As in an abusive marriage the health of the children (us) should be of ultimate importance. As in any divorce there would be pain during CHOP’s custody battle and the dividing up of assets. A long and painful process. Every CHOP of the country could share in the assets and debt.

  The citrus-forward, medium-body American pale ale is "very smooth" and made exclusively with hops from Howe Farms in Crown Point, Four Fathers co-owner Colin Oswald said.

  "You tell people, 'These hops are from Crown Point,' and they're like, 'Oh, really?'" he said. "It's a really nice selling feature."


  Using locally grown hops also saves on transportation costs, he said.


  Dr. Terminus got its name from the movie "Pete's Dragon," Oswald said. In the movie about a boy and his dragon, Dr. Terminus is a traveling salesman peddling a magical tonic.


  Lacny came up with the name, Oswald said.

One ruling means that the subpoena issued to Trump's long-term accounting firm, Mazars LLP, for various financial records to be turned over to a grand jury as part of a criminal investigation can be enforced.But the court sidestepped a major ruling on whether three House committees could also obtain Trump financial documents under subpoena, in what is a short-term win for Trump. Litigation will now continue in lower courts.In both rulings, Roberts was joined by the court's four liberals as well as Trump's two conservative appointees to the court, Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch.Unlike other recent presidents, Trump has refused to release his tax returns and other documents that could provide details on his wealth and the activities of his family real-estate company, the Trump Organization. The content of these records has remained a persistent mystery even as he seeks re-election on November 3. Thursday's rulings represent another milestone in Trump's tumultuous presidency.House committees issued subpoenas seeking Trump's financial records from his longtime accounting firm Mazars LLP and two banks, Deutsche Bank and Capital One.As part of a criminal investigation by the office of Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance, a Democrat, subpoenas were issued to Mazars for financial records including nearly a decade of Trump's tax returns to be turned over to a grand jury in New York City.The investigation launched by Vance's office in 2018 into Trump and the Trump Organization was spurred by disclosures of hush payments to two women who said they had past sexual relationships with him, pornographic film actress Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal. Trump and his aides have denied the relationships.In the litigation over the House subpoenas, Trump argued that Congress lacked a valid purpose for seeking his records and that disclosure of the material would compromise his and his family's privacy and distract him from his duties.In the New York case, Trump's lawyers argued that under the Constitution he is immune from any criminal proceeding while serving as president. They also cited Justice Department guidance that a sitting president cannot be indicted or prosecuted.In a lower court hearing, Trump's lawyers went so far as to argue that law enforcement officials would not have the power to investigate Trump even if he shot someone on New York's Fifth Avenue.The House Oversight Committee in April 2019 issued a subpoena to Mazars seeking eight years of accounting and other financial information in response to the congressional testimony of Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer. Cohen said Trump had inflated and deflated certain assets on financial statements between 2011 and 2013 in part to reduce his real estate taxes.The House Financial Services Committee has been examining possible money laundering in US property deals involving Trump. In a separate investigation, the House Intelligence Committee is investigating whether Trump's dealings left him vulnerable to the influence of foreign individuals or governments.

The Wisconsin laws curtailed powers of both the governor and attorney general, but the case ruled on Thursday dealt primarily with powers taken away from Kaul. The Supreme Court previously rejected a lawsuit that challenged the legality of the lame duck session itself.
 Thursday’s ruling involved a case filed by a coalition of labor unions led by the State Employees International Union. The coalition argued that the laws give the Legislature power over the attorney general’s office, a violation of the separation of powers doctrine in the state constitution. The doctrine grants each branch of government core powers: the Legislature writes laws, the executive branch enforces them and the judicial branch interprets them.
 The laws at issue prohibit Evers from ordering Kaul to withdraw from lawsuits; let legislators intervene in lawsuits using their own attorneys rather than Kaul’s state Department of Justice lawyers; and force Kaul to get permission from the Legislature’s Republican-controlled budget committee before setting lawsuits.
 That last provision has proven the most divisive. Kaul has said settlement discussions are confidential and has refused to share details of cases with the committee, putting tens of millions of dollars in potential settlement revenue in jeopardy. In recent months the committee has signed off on a handful of settlements after the litigants allowed Kaul to share details of the deals, however.
 The court ruled 5-2 that the attorney general derives his powers from state statutes, not the constitution, and his role is not a core function of the executive branch. The Legislature clearly has an interest in joining lawsuits independently and signing off on settlements because it's responsible for spending the state's money, Justice Brian Hagedorn wrote for the majority.
 "While representing the State in litigation is predominately an executive function, it is within those borderlands of shared powers, most notably in cases that implicate an institutional interest of the legislature," Hagedorn wrote.

Some startups may emerge from these programs newly equipped to address needs that have arisen during the pandemic.
 The 2020 Visa Everywhere Initiative started with five “challenge questions” that are meant to help fintechs focus on an area where they can improve on payments. After the pandemic started affecting businesses worldwide, Visa added a sixth: _How would your startup help support small businesses to recover from the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and accelerate deployment, since timely access is so critical right now?_ (The finals for this particular challenge question will take place virtually on September 9, and a single winner will earn $50,000.)
 The startups in Financial Solutions Lab’s cohort all focus on advancing the financial health of underserved workers and students — a population that has already been severely impacted by the pandemic.
 One company, Summer, has tweaked its product to assist borrowers who are collecting unemployment or who have had their hours cut, and incorporated new options under the federal coronavirus rescue package. It also partnered with Steady, an app for hourly and gig workers, as well as the states of Connecticut, Rhode Island and Pennsylvania to offer its services to impacted students.
 The current situation has also given organizers food for thought as they plan for future cohorts.
 “As we start to think about areas we want to focus in the future, those are heavily influenced by what’s happening in both the crisis related to pandemic and what we’re seeing in terms of social injustice and inequality,” Thompson said. “What we are seeing in the world today tells us to push ourselves even further and faster.”

While in New York, Abe and Shirley raised four children. Sharrell Haygood (m. Bernard Haygood), the oldest of their children, retired from the District Attorney’s office in Atlanta, GA. Sherry Harrell (m. Lawrence Harrell), their second daughter who passed away in 2017, was the Vice President of Regions Bank in Montgomery, AL and later managed all four Walmart Woodforest banks in Montgomery, AL. Sheila Shelton, their youngest daughter who passed away in 2016, worked for the Department of the Navy in Virginia Beach, VA. Sean Shelton (m. Nicole Shelton), their only son and youngest child, is a retired New York City Corrections Captain who worked at Riker’s Island.
 During his time in New York, Abe worked as a janitor and as a letter carrier and special delivery messenger for the United States Postal Service. He resumed his college education at Queens College where he continued as a participant in the college band, the choir, and the prestigious Queens College vocal ensemble. Abe graduated from Queens College and began his teaching career in the New York City Public School System. He began his career as a classroom teacher, music teacher, and band director. Abe also spent time as the director of the Evening Community Night Center for teenagers at August Martin High School and P.S. 123. After receiving his master’s degree in education, Abe was promoted to assistant principal, and finally became the principal of P.S. 96 in Queens, New York. In 1995, Abe retired from the New York City Public School system after 32 years of dedicated service. Soon after, he and his wife returned home to Alexander City, Alabama.
 Abe’s love of music was not only evident in his career, he was also invited to perform with the Max Roach Jazz Choir and the Carr-Hill Singers. His participation in both choral groups afforded him the opportunity to travel to Europe, sing on a recorded compilation entitled “To the Max, with Max Roach and Jazz Choir” and sing in the choral version of the Broadway musical “Porgy and Bess” where he received a standing ovation for his rendition of “It Ain’t Necessarily So.” With his wife, Shirley, Abe was an active member of the National Association of Negro Business and Professional Women’s Clubs Inc. His role as an ombudsman (President of the “HoneyDo” club) allowed him to continue to play his music at various community events as his wife was the president of the Baisley Park Club NANBPW chapter in New York and the Central Alabama Club chapter in Alabama. He attended the Alexander City Presbyterian Church where he sang tenor in the choir.
 As a renaissance man and world traveler, Abe was also an avid tennis player and snow skier. He was an active member of the American Tennis Association winning numerous trophies and accolades. He was also a member of the National Brotherhood of Skiers and traveled all over the United States (accompanied by his son Sean Shelton) enjoying his love of the sport.
 Abraham’s legacy lives on in his grandchildren. His oldest granddaughters, Atisha and Latisha Burks, both hold master’s degrees. Atisha is a Senior Accounting executive with the Navy. Following in her grandfather’s footsteps, Latisha Burks is a high school teacher and instructional mentor. Keeyanna Haygood worked for the Atlanta Marta Transportation system for over 8 years. Keehlan Haygood received his bachelor’s degree in criminal justice and is now working for the Fulton County District Attorney’s Office in Atlanta, Georgia. His youngest grandchildren, Brianna and Samantha Shelton, both attend Rutgers’s University where they are studying Veterinary Science and Chemical Engineering respectively.

Another thing about Easter eggs: Dean sees that movie while standing beside Syd Barrett — one of many rock star cameos. The stars look very different today, but in “Utopia Avenue,” they’re young and charismatic. Brian Jones is the nicest of the bunch, and there are walk-ons by David Bowie, Janis Joplin, Leonard Cohen, Jimi Hendrix, Frank Zappa, Harold Pinter and many more. If at times their dialogue is a little too on the nose, if occasionally someone drops their own lyrics in conversation, it’s forgivable. Not every reader will be obsessive about ’60s lyrics, just as not everyone who reads this book will be obsessive about the Mitchellverse.
 That Mitchell is braiding reality into his fiction in this book does give it a different glow. Brian Eno called Britain’s ’60s musical universe “The Scenius,” Elf explains. “Right now, the scenius of London, and Soho, is pretty perfect. We’ve the venues, studios with multi-track recorders, the radio stations, the music papers and magazines … We made our album, sure. But it emerged from the scenius.”
 With his huge electric brain, Mitchell has written his own solo scenius, one that draws connections between Edo-era Japan and a distant, post-human- collapse future. It’s a grand project, brilliantly executed and deeply humanist. “Utopia Avenue” is the most fun stop along the way and aptly named. In 2020, there is something utopian about the idea of people gathering together to make and record and play music, to create a scenius together. We’ll get back to the garden someday.

Pat Vigliorolo, co-president of Cape Cod Hydrangea Society surrounds herself with flowers. A New Jersey native, she visited the Cape part-time from 2005-2012, joined CCHS in 2007 and moved from Texas to the Cape permanently in 2013.
 And from state to state, year to year, there were always flowers.
 "Every house we've owned -- I've gardened in one way or another," says Vigliorolo, a resident of Yarmouth Port.
 After serving as vice president of CCHS (which has about 200 members) for three years, Vigliorolo took over as co-president with Linda Coven in September 2019. The two share the same love for a particular plant. Coven's home garden, for instance, features 200 hydrangeas in the ground and 20 planters with hydrangeas. Her garden has grown year to year, but this year, a limit was reached; there'd be too much upkeep with more, she says.
 The role of CCHS co-president involves a lot of work, Vigliorolo explains, and the annual Cape Cod Hydrangea Festival (CCHF) is a culmination of much of that work -- it's the society's biggest fundraiser of the year. In 2019, the festival raised $50,000 for the society and local nonprofits according to Greta Georgieva at the Cape Cod Chamber of Commerce.
 And though the pandemic might have reduced participation this year, the flowers will be more plentiful than ever. The number of gardens and non- profits are lower than previous years as a result of coronavirus concerns, and a few related events have moved online.
 In 2019, there were 70 open gardens and 17 participating non-profits. This year, 28 gardens will be open and 10 non-profits will participate, and a couple of additional programs -- Hydrangea University (with keynote speaker Joan Harrison, founder of CCHS) and workshops by Hyannis Country Gardens -- will be virtual this summer.
 Hydrangea buds set in August/September and remain until spring, and since there wasn't a sustained temperature below 32 degrees this past winter, the buds will be fabulous, Vigliorolo says. Her own garden won't be in the festival since, but she's looking forward to being a docent alongside Coven at the Heritage Museums & Gardens CCHS display garden.
 •••
 The CCHF was created six years ago by local "plant geek" C.L Fornari. The speaker and author was inspired by Garden Walk Buffalo and remembers talking with friend and horticulturalist Marcia Chapman about implementing a similar festival on the Cape.
 The hydrangea festival is meant to celebrate Cape Cod gardens (specifically the blue hydrangea), to serve as a space for local nonprofits to raise funds, to promote plants themselves and to support Cape Cod businesses, Fornari says.
 This year, due to the pandemic, some businesses weren't able to be as involved as in years past; the CCHF Cocktail Trail -- bartenders across the Cape put together their own signature hydrangea cocktail -- cannot happen. Artists are still expected to show up announced at some gardens to create their impressions of plants and landscapes, but some other past elements can't be incorporated this year. Fornari is philosophical about those changes, and is looking forward to next year when she hopes elements can be reintroduced.
 And in the meantime, she's excited about sharing her garden -- which has been in the festival since its inception -- with visitors. Fornari remembers one particular time a couple of years ago when a young woman walked down her driveway and stopped by the entry of her garden.
 "Her hands kind of went to her chest, and she said…(gasps), 'I didn't know this was possible,'" Fornari recalls. "And that, is like everything to me, to show people what is possible."
 She says she likes how by visiting gardens, guests can take ideas and inspiration to their gardens at home.
 Fornari resides in Sandwich on a property she's named Poison Ivy Acres, which hosts a cheerful and realistic meaning.
 "It's kind of a zen thing. It's a little reminder that life contains not only the beautiful flowers that we want to grow, but the unwanted and itchy. And if you can embrace the total experience of all of it in life, you're better off," Fornari says.

 Marcia Chapman and her husband George have lived on the Cape for 35 years and have worked in horticulture for years. George is now retired but works part- time as a Landscape Director at Highfield Hall & Gardens and is a gardening consultant for landscape companies and homeowners. Marcia manages at M.R. Soares Flower Garden Nursery in East Falmouth.
 "I tell everyone I don't boat, I don't golf, I garden," George says. "I mean it's what I do. It's my hobby. It's what I love. Marcia and I, it's our passion. It's our thing."
 For George, it's difficult to pick a favorite flower. In July and August, he says it's probably the hydrangea, but it shifts depending on the time of year.
 This marks the sixth year that the Chapmans' garden has been a part of CCHF, and George says the festival is special to guests because it's a place for ideas to be shared. This year, there were concerns regarding whether the festival would happen due to the pandemic, and luckily, of course, it will, offering a place for guests to explore and enjoy nature.
