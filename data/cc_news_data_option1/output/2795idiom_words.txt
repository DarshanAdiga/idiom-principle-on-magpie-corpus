And, beautifully, she recalled her days with Sushant. "Sushant and I started out by workshopping together in a theatre group. I was sharing a 700 sq ft apartment in Andheri West with a friend from Delhi. Sushant would pick me up on his bike and we would head to the rehearsal, for which I was grateful. I wasn't poor or broke. But I can't say money was not a consideration when I had to head out to do an ad audition for a skin brand. I would worry about my make up melting in the auto rickshaw before I even arrived. This was would NEVER happen with a 'star-kid', and if it does, they will be lauded for being humble enough to take the rickshaw in the first place."

Richa revealed that filmmakers "have run down movies of their peers pre- release, have replaced actresses who refused to sleep with them at the last minute and several have in fact repeatedly forecasted ‘iska kuch nahi hoga’."

For starters, Richa criticised the way media has covered the death. "The reporting around Sushant’s demise has been so disastrous, there have been a spate of suicides in it’s aftermath. Who then decided to write a fictional account of his struggles with mental health (sic)?" She called out the media for circulating pictures of Sushant's dead body on media groups on WhatsApp.

Then, of course, unlike ever before, Sushant's death has also triggered the debate about nepotism, which was sparked off by Kangana Ranaut on an glamourous episode of Koffee With Karan, years ago.

Then she did not spare the so called fans who are on a crusade to harass everyone related to Sushant - from his girlfriend he wanted to marry to his friends, whom they accuse were not there. Who are these 'fans'? I checked out a few profiles online. The same gutter mouths that abused Sushant when he took a stand on the 'Padmavat' issue are now abusing his loved ones for 'not being there' for him. Several of these are fake fan profiles that have emerged overnight, they're using his images to get their daily fix of online validation," Richa rightly pointed out.
