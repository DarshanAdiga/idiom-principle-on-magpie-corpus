A year ago, Google tweaked Chrome so that it can fill out your credit card details even if you don't switch on the browser's sync feature. Now, the tech giant is making it even easier to access your logins and payment details without having to sync across devices, so long as you're signed in. Google says in its announcement that Chrome on Android will "soon" give you a way to sign in with a single tap using any of the accounts you've previously used on the device. That said, you'll also be able to sign in without saving your account, or go straight to Incognito mode. Google If you do choose to sign in, you'll get quick access to payment details stored in that particular Google account -- you only have to confirm a card's CVC or authenticate your identity with biometrics to be able to use it. You'll also be able to use a new card and save its details on that account. Google is making it easier to access and save passwords, as well. Chrome will be able to autofill passwords on websites that you previously saved to your account in the near future-- again, even if sync isn't switched on. And yes, you'll also be able to save new passwords to your account and be able to access them on the device you're using or across all your devices. This feature will be rolling out to all users over the next couple of months. Google

SINGAPORE (AP) — A passenger on board a Royal Caribbean “cruise to nowhere\" has been diagnosed with the coronavirus, prompting the vessel to return early to Singapore on Wednesday. Royal Caribbean said in a statement that a guest on the Quantum of the Seas ship “tested positive for coronavirus after checking in with our medical team.\" “We identified and isolated all guests and crew who had close contact with this guest, and each of those individuals have subsequently tested negative for the virus,\" it said. The ship returned to port in accordance with government protocols, and will allow guests to leave after a review of contact tracing is completed, it said. Singapore recently began a “safe cruising” pilot program allowing cruise ships to make round trips to Singapore with no port of call in between. Strict safety measures were imposed, including reducing capacity by half and pre- boarding testing for passengers. Royal Caribbean is one of two operators licensed to run such trips. The Singapore Straits Times reported that the patient on the Quantum of the Seas was an 83-year-old Singaporean. It said the vessel, which has 1,680 guests and 1,148 crew members on board, returned on the third day of a four-day trip. Annie Chang, director of cruise at the Singapore Tourism Board, was quoted by the Straits Times as saying that the passenger had tested negative for COVID-19 before boarding. When he reported to the online medical team with diarrhea, he was tested again and found to be positive, she said. All leisure activities ceased immediately, passengers were asked to stay in their cabins and emergency response plans were activated including immediate isolation of close contacts, contact tracing and deep cleaning of the ship, she added. Calls and emails to the...

Asian shares logged strong gains on Wednesday after another round of record highs for major indexes on Wall Street. Benchmarks rose in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Seoul. Shanghai edged lower after China reported that its consumer price index slipped 0.5% in November compared with a year earlier. Economists said the country’s first slip into deflation since 2009 was no cause for alarm. The overall measure was dragged down by falling food prices due to improvements in supplies of pork, which have been disrupted while authorities fight outbreaks of African swine fever, while other prices gained as economic activity recovers from the coronavirus pandemic. “Looking through the recent volatility in food and energy prices, the inflation data are less downbeat than meets the eye,\" Capital Economics said in a commentary. It noted that core consumer price inflation, excluding volatile food and energy prices, was steady at 0.5% from a year earlier. Strong demand was also driving a recovery manufactured goods' prices, it said. Japan released data showing strong machinery orders in October, adding to signs its economy is on the mend.
