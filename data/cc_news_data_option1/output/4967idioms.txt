Employers will prioritise the needs of their workers and take steps to ensure a safe return to the workplace by putting protocols in place to limit potential exposure. In tandem, employees will be looking for support to help them adapt and grow amid changing working conditions. ADP surveyed employers with 1,000+ employees at the onset of the pandemic and found 39% of employers reported that employees' health fear was a top concern. As employers prioritise the health and safety of their workers, the nature of the workplace itself will evolve.

But Microsoft too will eventually see the fruits of its labor when its new first party studios start producing their own titles. And for hardware? It seems destined that PS5 is _always_ going to outsell Series X/S in the long run, but there’s really no avoiding that now, and Microsoft really isn’t even trying to pretend that won’t happen. Both consoles also seem likely to release an upgraded “Pro” version like we saw last generation, so we’ll see if there’s a PS4 Pro/One X size performance gap there when that does happen, not that it really changed things all that much for Microsoft.

The FAI have been forced to abandon the League of Ireland U-13 and U-15 seasons following health advice from the Irish Sports Council. Better news is expected from government agencies that will facilitate the green-light for U-17 and U-19 fixtures to resume but there will be disappointment about the younger national leagues.They had managed to progress their schedule up to October 16 without any confirmed Covid-19 cases among players and staff.The resurgence in cases prompted the government to suspend all underage leagues at that point but clubs had received fixture lists for their last three series of games, starting this Saturday.National league clubs were given the option on whether to participate in the resumption of the underage national leagues.Bray Wanderers, having originally signalled their intention to withdraw, eventually agreed to complete the season but Derry City and Longford Town opted out.The FAI revealed on Tuesday, following the national switch from level five to three, that they were &quot;awaiting clarification regarding how the restrictions will impact underage elite national league football and would update affiliates at the earliest opportunity.&quot;The association have now conceded defeat in their bid to resume all of their leagues, based on the latest health and safety advice.The U-17 and U-19s, as is the case for the minor GAA and hurling championships, should be back in action over the coming days. They have two series of matches remaining, along with cup finals.The FAI&rsquo;s medical director, Dr Alan Byrne, was in May appointed to the Government&rsquo;s &lsquo;Return to Sport&rsquo; medical expert group.They were tasked with finalising &quot;Return to Training and Return to Football protocols&quot;. All five underage national leagues, the SSE Airtricity underage leagues and women's national U17 league were postponed with all other elite underage football games being suspended. As with adult amateur and underage grassroots football, underage elite teams are only permitted to train in a non-contact environment and in pods of 15, subject to current Government guidelines. Schoolboys/girls leagues are planning to have fixtures up and running in mid-January.
