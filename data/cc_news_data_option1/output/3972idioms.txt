Sobre un terreno de gravilla frente las aguas turquesas del mar Mediterráneo, Jean-Claude Calcagno se prepara para una ronda de petanca, la versión francesa del juego de bolos y el deporte favorito de los jubilados. Su club situado en el área de Niza de la costa francesa normalmente está repleto de gente, pero Calcagno dice que muchos de sus miembros prefirieron quedarse en casa, espantados por la reaparición de brotes de COVID-19. “Están un poco renuentes”, dijo Calcagno sobre sus compañeros, la mayoría de ellos ancianos. “Si siguen teniendo dudas, no vendrán”. Tras una disminución de los casos en el verano boreal, la pandemia de coronavirus está ganando terreno nuevamente en muchas partes de Europa y este sector del sur de Francia es un punto de riesgo. El Gobierno francés designó a la región alrededor de Niza como una zona de alerta. Los bares y restaurantes deben cerrar a las 10 de la noche y no se permiten reuniones de más de diez personas en un solo lugar. El sector también tiene una concentración inusual de jubilados. Las personas con más de 60 años componen el 29.6% de la población de Niza, de acuerdo a la agencia de estadísticas estatal, en comparación con el 20.5% de nivel nacional. A los retirados les atrae el buen tiempo durante gran parte del año y las recreaciones y servicios para personas mayores. En el club de petanca pueden verse una tienda de equipos de apoyo auditivo y la consulta de un cardiólogo en un radio de 200 metros. Pero la combinación de casos más agudos de coronavirus y una población importante de adultos mayores ha hecho que muchos jubilados de la ciudad se muestren temerosos. “La segunda ola está en camino, hay que estar alertas”, dijo la semana pasada el alcalde de Niza, Christian Estrosi. La vida ha cambiado para la comunidad que rodea al club de petanca, justo frente a la localidad de Promenade des Anglais. El presidente del centro deportivo, Jean Sanchez, dice que solo un tercio de los miembros han llegado a los juegos. En el terreno de gravilla, los jugadores tratan de que la pelota toque el boliche. Usualmente, la ronda termina con varios de los jubilados tirando la pelota cada vez más cerca del boliche, calculando quién ha llegado más cerca. Ahora, una sola persona puede observar a los otros desde una distancia segura, dice Annie Saudin. Saudin, que tiene más de 70 años, dice que empezó a jugar petanca porque necesitaba la interacción social. Pero ahora prefiere quedarse más tiempo en casa. Solo utiliza el tranvía si es estrictamente necesario y se mantiene alejada del centro de la ciudad para evitar aglomeraciones. Ya no visita más a sus amigos. “Este asunto no se ha terminado todavía”, dijo sobre el virus. “Necesitamos estar alertas, especialmente los mayores”.

CONNEAUT LAKE — Conneaut Lake is traditionally home to aquatic life such as pike, bass and bluegills. Now a new form of wildlife has been spotted in the body of water, one not native to this country.
 Freshwater jellyfish in Conneaut Lake were seen by employees of Nye’s Marina at the end of August. An Aug. 31 video uploaded to the marina’s Facebook page shows the diminutive jellyfish swimming near the marina’s docks.
 Dustin Eaton — sales manager for Nye’s Marina, and the person who filmed the video — said the jellyfish were first spotted by another employee, Jesse Nye, while he was underwater working on a ramp. The spotting occurred sometime between 11 a.m. and noon.
 “They look just like jellyfish in the ocean, but they’re much smaller,” Eaton said.
 The marina staff continued seeing the jellyfish for four or five days after the first appearance, but haven’t seen them since. Eaton said the workers noticed the jellyfish were only visible when the sun was out. He called it “the most surprising” creature he’d ever seen in the lake.
 Freshwater jellyfish, also known as craspedacusta sowerbii, are native to China, according to Sara Stahlman, extension lead at the Pennsylvania Sea Grant. However, they made their way to the United States in the early 1900s and have spread to many, but not all, states.
 “They actually are fairly common,” Stahlman said. “They’re mostly found in the eastern United States, but populations have popped up all over the place.”
 Despite their name, freshwater jellyfish are not true jellyfish, instead belonging to a related family called hydras. In fact, most of the time they do not look that similar to jellyfish at all.
 Stahlman explained that freshwater jellyfish have two stages of life — a juvenile polyp stage and an adult medusa stage. The jellyfish spend most of their life in the polyp stage, only developing into the medusa stage under certain conditions, and the species will even regress to the polyp stage if those conditions are no longer available.

Rose Williams, program coordinator, said Getting Ahead in the Valley falls under the auspices of the CommUnity Zone of Lewisburg.
 David Temple, of Milton, one of the program participants, said the graduates learned of community resources that are available to help lift them out of poverty and other unfortunate situations. They also learned the importance of sharing those resources with others in need.
 “I love this group,” Temple said. “I have already shared it with 13 people who have filled out applications to be in the next one.”
 Williams said this year’s graduating class met weekly, starting Feb. 25.
 “We tried to remove every barrier for attendance,” she said. “We provided child care (so parents could attend).”
 While the program organizers initially thought they had removed all barriers to attendance, the COVID-19 pandemic soon hit.
 “We had to think outside the box,” Williams said.
 When the pandemic first struck, the weekly sessions were held via phone or virtually. Participants were provided with a weekly food box.
 As soon as conditions allowed, Williams said in-person meetings resumed.
 “We met in a relatively large space so we could socially distance,” she noted.
 When selecting applicants to participate in the program, Williams said it was important for her to make sure the class was s diverse one, incorporating men, women and individuals from various ethnic backgrounds.

SELINSGROVE — The last time Max Moyers played a home game on a Saturday night at Selinsgrove, he tore his ACL, which ended his junior season last year.
 This time, Lewisburg’s Saturday night home game at Harold Bolig Memorial Stadium ended much sweeter. With the game against Midd West tied, 90 seconds remaining and Lewisburg backed up at its own 17-yard line, Moyers took control.
 He caught a pass for 7 yards, then after a personal foul against Midd West gave the Green Dragons an extra 15 yards, Moyers took off for runs of 32 and 29 yards, the latter of which went for a touchdown, and Lewisburg earned a 35-28 win over the Mustangs for their first victory of the season.
 “That was Max literally saying, ‘I’m not losing.’ Their defensive tackle had him by his chest, and he just ran through it and shoved him off,” said Lewisburg coach Marc Persing. “I think it was good for his confidence that he can still break off those runs. When you’re playing us, you’re going to try to stop Max, but when things get rocking and rolling, that’s a three-headed monster with Ethan (Dominick), Max and Cam (Michaels). We just need to get rolling more consistently.”
 Prior to Lewisburg’s final drive, Moyers had been somewhat contained by Midd West, rushing for 70 yards on 19 carries. He scored the first touchdown of the game to give Lewisburg a 7-0 lead late in the first quarter, but from that point, it was a back-and-forth game, with neither team able to pull away.
 “Moyers is a good back and we knew that, but I’m really pleased with our defensive front tonight. (We) did a good job containing their running game, but they got those two plays and that was the killer for us,” said Midd West coach Brad Hatter.
 On Lewisburg’s next drive after Moyers’ initial touchdown, the Green Dragons put together a six-play, 43-yard drive capped by a Michaels 12-yard touchdown run on the first play of the second quarter.
 Midd West put together a five-play drive that took nearly seven minutes, and was capped by Hunter Wolfley’s 13-yard touchdown catch in the corner of the end zone.
