This revelation is nothing new. Gum and tooth health supplements are prevalent in the alternative health industry.

With that in mind, there’s not a lot of evidence supporting the claims made regarding Steel Bite Pro. Also, it doesn’t help to honestly assess this supplement’s worth, let alone its safety because individuals are not provided with the complete nutritional facts. Hence, paying close to $70 for a one- month's’ worth of supply seems somewhat over the top. To add to this, there are no details regarding the company that brought Steel Bite Pro to market, and this lack of transparency needs to be addressed with customer service.

Groban has been nominated for a Grammy, Emmy and Tony. His last album was 2018′s “Bridges,” with original music, and he was on Broadway in 2017 for a run in “Natasha, Pierre & The Great Comet of 1812.” The pandemic hit after Groban’s tour and interrupted his planned string of concerts at Radio City Music Hall.
 Making an album of originals and touring with it “refilled my tank to be an interpreter. My tank kind of ebbs and flows. There are times where I really want to craft from scratch,” he said. “And then there are times when I am reminded just how much I love just simply interpreting and how universal these classic songs can be.”
 Groban is pushing himself to work, even though the pandemic has taken away some of his discipline. He does his scales daily and sings regularly, though video games are a constant background temptation.
 The virus has forced Groban to work differently. Before the pandemic, he'd bring a bunch of ideas to a co-writer or a producer he had recorded on his iPhone and the two would flush out a tune. Now he's alone.

Diminished trust
 This refers to ‘MSMEs tripped by trade credit collapse’ (August 17). The main external sources of funding for the business operations of MSMEs are financial institutions, informal money-lenders and material suppliers. The permissible quantum of funds from financial institutions, especially from the banking sector, is subject to the cash inflows of the units from other sources. Despite the government’s credit-oriented packages to accelerate the flow of formal credit to MSME units, vulnerable micro and small units still turn to the local money-lenders and or small NBFCs for their credit needs. The lack of trust towards small units shown by the market constrains them from using the credit to buy materials.
 Honouring commitments in respect of servicing the debts and meeting contract obligations are critical in building trust in the market. The deteriorating repayment and compliance cultures adversely affect the growth of trust in the system. The timely realisation of receivables enables the seller to liquidate his liabilities towards the creditors and thus smoothen the rotation of the working capital.
 There must be a mechanism to incentivise sellers to sell goods and services to MSMEs, more particularly to those micro and small units who are unable to raise credit purchases. At a time when the economy is seeing chaos, it is essential to further strengthen the support to MSMEs to accelerate economic activities and speed up the growth of jobs and exports of goods and services.

 Reputation risk management
 This has reference to ‘Independent directors and brand reputation’ (August 17). The brand reputation of a company is independent of its directors and is built because of quality of its products and services, ethical practices and adherence to laws of the land. The independent director cannot build the reputation of the company on his own, but his presence in the board can add to the organisation’s credibility.
 Corporate groups, growing companies and those dealing in finance must approach corporate reputation management as a regular function. This involves weeding out unscrupulous characters in the company, internal control, avoiding litigation, controlling frauds and treating reputation risk as part of risk management. Companies having a strong whistle-blower policy will be able to manage reputation risk well, as warning signals will be highlighted in the complaints. For independent directors, this is a useful tool as they will get a feel of internal problems through such complaints easily.

 Dhoni’s ad career
 Apropos ‘Retired, but Brand Dhoni still on a strong advertising pitch’ (August 17). No other cricketer in the sport’s history can boast of three ICC trophies and top global Test rankings, such was the aura of MS Dhoni’s achievements that made him a great captain. He could have extended his shorter-format international career had it not been for Covid-19. Dhoni’s journey from a small-town boy to one of the most astute team leaders the world has seen is no short of a fairytale.
 Even though he has retired from international cricket, and will only be present during the IPL season, his brand will continue to have a strong recall value. Since calmness and reliability define Dhoni, all those brands which associate with him and these values will still bear fruit.

 Right to criticise
 The All India Lawyers’ Union’s concern over the Supreme Court holding senior advocate Prashanth Bhushan in contempt is genuine. It will create a bad precedent, hampering the Constitutional right of free speech. In a democratic country like India, nothing or nobody is exempt from fair criticism. The judiciary commands respect but never demands it. Respect and dignity can not be demanded from citizens on the threat of contempt.
 The best way to sustain dignity and respect for the office of the judge is to continue striving to deserve it from the public.

Browns owners Jimmy and Dee Haslam admitted they learned a lesson last season: Don't get caught up in the hype.
   
 The Browns had huge expectations in 2019 because they loaded up on talent, but the team flopped and underwent another regime change after going 6-10.
   
 "I think we probably, all of us, including ownership, learned a lesson last year about tempering expectations, and I don't think we managed that as well as we should have," Jimmy Haslam said Sunday during a Zoom video conference after the second full-squad practice of training camp. "I think you've got to be realistic. This team hasn't been to the playoffs since [2002].
   
 "We're in a tough division. Baltimore and Pittsburgh are arguably two of the best teams and best franchises. So I think you have to be realistic there. We're still a young team. On the other hand, we feel really good about [General Manager] Andrew [Berry] and [first-year head coach] Kevin [Stefanski], our coaching staff, our personnel group and the talent that we've been able to assemble. So we're excited going into the year, but realistic."
   
 The Browns will have a good chance to live up to their potential if their headliners play like the stars they're often advertised as.
   
 Quarterback Baker Mayfield, defensive end Myles Garrett and wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. are at the top of the list.
   
 Jimmy Haslam expressed confidence Mayfield and Garrett will bounce back from disappointing 2019 seasons, and Dee Haslam believes Beckham is more at ease in Cleveland a year removed from the New York Giants trading him to the Browns.
   
 Mayfield showed great promise as a rookie No. 1 overall draft pick in 2018, but he regressed last season.
   
 "He came back in great shape," Jimmy Haslam said. "I think he's taken a really good leadership role, and we appreciated what he said [recently] about owning up to, hey, last year he wasn't himself. But I think he's going put that behind him.
   
 "He had a really good practice today. We're really excited to see what he can do both in terms of being the quarterback, but also being one of the leaders of the team."
   
 Garrett's 2019 season ended when the NFL suspended him for the final six games because he hit Mason Rudolph over the head with the Steelers quarterback's helmet on Nov. 14. Garrett, the 2017 No. 1 overall pick, had 10 sacks through 10 games, but no one knows exactly how he'll play in the aftermath of the controversy.
   
 Still, the Browns signed Garrett a month ago to a five-year contract extension worth $125 million in new money, securing him for the next seven seasons.
   
 "We spent a lot of time talking about Myles and his situation, a lot of time. That's a huge contract," Jimmy Haslam said. "But I think most of y'all know Myles, and Myles did something that was unbelievably out of character, unfortunately.
   
 "He paid for it dearly, and we paid for it dearly, but we know him and his family well. We know the kind of person, the kind of man he is. At the same time, we know the kind of player [he is]. So we spent a lot of time thinking about it. But we're excited that he's going to be a Cleveland Brown for a long, long time."
   
 Garrett has sat out the first two practices of training camp with a hamstring injury.
   
 "I think he'll be back on the field in a few days, and it'll be good to have [No.] 95 out there because he makes a hell of a difference when he's out there," Jimmy Haslam said.
   
 A three-time Pro Bowl selection, Beckham has said being traded from the Giants provided a shock to the system last year, and his first season with the Browns didn't meet his expectations. He had 74 catches for 1,035 yards and four touchdowns in 16 games, but he never consistently got on the same page as Mayfield. He also played the entire season hurt and had surgery Jan. 21 to repair a core muscle injury.
   
 Dee Haslam shared what Beckham told her in their recent exchange of text messages.
   
 "I just feel like he's just so much more comfortable here, and he said that," Dee Haslam said. "He says, 'I'm in my home. I'm more comfortable.' I think it was a transition, but I think he's doing really well and love the fact that he's talking about how happy he is to be here and how comfortable he is. I think it's a great improvement. So we're really excited that he feels that way."
   
 Jimmy Haslam added Beckham is healthy now.
   
 "I think that's made a big difference, too," Dee Haslam said. "He's healthy this year, and he feels confident."

Formerly the club&rsquo;s head of football, Sanllehi&rsquo;s exit means managing director Vinai Venkatesham will sit at the top of the new hierarchy, with head coach Mikel Arteta and technical director Edu to make the footballing decisions.Here, the PA news agency takes a closer look at the work Arteta and Edu have ahead of them in the coming weeks.Announce Aubameyang A new deal for captain and talisman Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is key for Arsenal – especially given the forward could leave for free next summer. The PA news agency understands a contract agreement is in place and an announcement could be made by the end of the week. Making sure they retain the services of such an important part of Arteta&rsquo;s side will be a boost for the coming years and show potential new recruits that the club mean business.A case for the defence Speaking of new recruits, Arteta said towards the end of last season that signing a defender will be important given the number of injuries he has in that position. Pablo Mari, Calum Chambers and Shkodran Mustafi all missed the FA Cup final win over Chelsea and, while William Saliba has now linked up with the first team following a season on loan at Saint-Etienne, Arsenal are likely to bring in more reinforcements. Lille&rsquo;s Gabriel Magalhaes has been strongly linked with a move to the Emirates Stadium, with the likes of Malang Sarr and John Stones outside bets, while strengthening midfield options is also high on the agenda.The Ozil poser Despite being the highest-paid player in the club&rsquo;s history, Mesut Ozil has fallen out of favour in north London. The 31-year-old did not feature for Arteta&rsquo;s side since the season restarted following the halt due to the coronavirus pandemic. Despite that, Ozil insisted last week in an interview with The Athletic that he will decide when he leaves the club – but can Arteta and Edu find a solution that either brings the former Germany international out from the cold or clears at least some of his salary from the wage bill?Clear the decks While supporters will quite rightly be focused on incomings this summer, Arsenal also have a number of players they need to offload – if only to balance the books. The likes of Sokratis Papastathopoulos, Lucas Torreira, Ainsley Maitland-Niles and Mohamed Elneny could all find themselves plying their trade elsewhere next season if the right offers come in. Then there is the future of Matteo Guendouzi, who has not been selected in a matchday squad since a post- match incident in June&rsquo;s defeat at Brighton led to further-reaching questions about the midfielder&rsquo;s mentality.Keeper conundrum Bernd Leno came second only to Aubameyang in Arsenal&rsquo;s official player of the year poll for the 2019/20 season. But his place as Arteta&rsquo;s first-choice goalkeeper heading into the new campaign is by no means certain following the fine form of Emiliano Martinez, who stepped in when Leno was injured at Brighton. The Argentinian excelled having finally been given his chance and the tough call on who will don the gloves is one that will have to be made – with the potential for the one who misses out to push for a move before the transfer window closes on October 5.

UPS driver David Brady unlocks mysteries all the time.
 On a route that requires him to deliver more than 200 packages daily from Seaside to Falcon Cove, Brady constantly must match unknown addresses and correct doorsteps in the least amount of time as possible.
 The friendly driver, who is well-known throughout South County, recently received an award of excellence from the CEO of UPS. The company’s northwest district president called him an “amazing ambassador.”
 Brady, however, said he didn’t feel he had done anything special.
 “I was pleasantly surprised,” he said. “I was just working to help my people.”
 It was around dinnertime two months ago — Brady works 12 hours a day — when he was heading down U.S. Highway 101 toward Arch Cape and turning onto Buena Vista Drive. He spotted some keys in gravel near the highway.
 “I thought, ‘Somebody is going to be wanting these,’” he recalled. “It wasn’t just one key. It was a lot of keys.”
 At first he thought about taking them to the Cannon Beach Police Department, but he noticed they were keys for a Subaru. Some of his Arch Cape customers owned Subarus, so he set out to solve the mystery.
 At the first house, he saw a Subaru in the driveway. He asked the person standing next to it if she had lost the keys. The woman, a Realtor looking at the house for a potential sale, said "no."
 Down the road was a regular customer who owned a Subaru. He didn’t have a package for her, but he stopped anyway. The keys weren’t hers.
 He turned onto the next road and kept looking. Finally, at the end of the cul- de-sac, he saw a Subaru Forester. He rang the doorbell and asked Bill Campbell if he had lost his keys. Campbell pushed the fob button, and his Subaru unlocked.
 “He almost broke into tears,” Brady said. “He didn’t know he had lost them. The Lord brought me to his place. The keys weren’t close to his home.”
 Campbell said his family had just sat down to dinner when Brady arrived with the missing keys.
 “I didn’t even realize they were gone,” Campbell said. “Because of him I never have to replace the keys that belong to the many locks in our lives.”
 Earlier that day, Campbell moved his car and put the keys in the back while doing chores. He forgot to pick them up, and when his wife, who later used her key to drive, accelerated to get onto the highway, Campbell figured his keys must have slipped off the back.
 “David is usually overwhelmed with packages to deliver, but he’s also observant,” Campbell said. “Even with all his work, he still decided to stop at every house until he got to the end of the cul-de-sac … It was the ultimate in customer service; the CEO had to know.”
 So Campbell wrote a letter to CEO David Abney saying that Brady went “above and beyond any expectation” to “make life easier for someone unknown." Campbell recommended that Brady be officially recognized for the “greatest act of customer service I could ever imagine.”
 Abney had a plaque engraved honoring Brady for excellent service. “This may be the last employee compliment that I receive as CEO,” wrote Abney, who was retiring. “It certainly ranks among the top of the list.”
 Brady, 59, used to own the Cannon Beach Bakery and was a fitness manager at a local gym before joining UPS 19 years ago. After working in the office, he became a driver in 2008. Since the coronavirus pandemic, Brady has seen a dramatic increase in packages to be delivered. His fitness watch clocks 38,000 steps — almost 20 miles — a day.
 While his job is physically demanding, Brady still takes time for “three- minute conversations” with his customers and distributes treats he keeps in his truck to local dogs. Campbell, who receives packages regularly, calls it the “David experience.”
 Brady said he has been offered easier routes, but he considers this route his home.
 “I love all my customers,” Brady said. “I love them all.”

So will Agee and his bandmates be rusty after such a long, uncharacteristic layoff?
 “Anything that you don’t run for a while might pop a little smoke. But you oil it up good and it will still do what it needs to do.”
 Rebirth has been doing what it needs to do for 37 years and counting. Tuba player Phil Frazier and brother Keith Frazier, a bass drummer, founded Rebirth with trumpeter Kermit Ruffins in 1983 as students at Joseph S. Clark Senior High School. They played for change in the French Quarter, aspiring to be the next Dirty Dozen Brass Band.
 They paid their dues in social aid and pleasure club parades and late-night gigs at neighborhood bars. Their "Do Whatcha Wanna" and "Feel Like Funkin' It Up" are now Carnival season standards.
 After Hurricane Katrina, Rebirth’s name and music embodied the city’s recovery. The band's 2011 Basin Street Records album "Rebirth of New Orleans" won a Grammy Award.
 The band has carried on even though Phil Frazier hasn’t been able to perform since suffering a stroke in late 2018, his second in a decade. But Phil and Keith, who commutes from his post-Katrina home in Dallas for shows, still lead the band.
 “At the end of the day, regardless of what illness Phil has, we can still understand ‘yes’ and ‘no,’” Agee said. “It’s his baby. The band has been his baby from Day 1 and it will be to Day Zero.”

_Art matters in our lives. In this series, Lagniappe presents a different work each week from the collection of the New Orleans Museum of Art,_ _with commentary from a curator._
 2020 has been a year of incessant illumination which has forced us all to reflect in revolutionary ways. Part of this journey has propelled the reconsideration of what we celebrate through public sculpture and other displays.
 While New Orleans was (somewhat) ahead of the curve by removing four racist monuments in 2017, the world is now doing this _en masse_ from Itta Bena, Mississippi, to Bristol, England.
 Teresita Fernández’s Viñales is an elaborate example of what a more righteous and culturally reflective public sculpture can look like. As a 51-foot long landscape, this site-specific piece’s majestic effect can be seen from almost any point in NOMA’s Besthoff Sculpture Garden expansion.
 Additionally, the piece’s exploration of the historic connections between Africa, Cuba and New Orleans stimulates conversations around the underdiscussed roots of New Orleans’ identity.
 In 1809 the city’s population doubled with the migration of nearly 10,000 Haitians, with many coming from Cuba — bringing with them foodways, architecture and customs that remain part of New Orleans today.
 Viñales captures the viewer with beauty and command to provide an entry point into learning about these buried histories in New Orleans along with other deeply African-influenced capitals of the Caribbean and Americas.

 The middle portion of the leaderboard is crowded.
   
 Things are crowded at Firestone. Except in the gallery, of course.
   
 Saturday is regarded as moving day and several players got out the two- wheelers and the vans to get themselves into contention in the Bridgestone Senior Championship at Firestone Country Club.
   
 Woody Austin and Scott Parel made the biggest moves on moving day with rounds of 3-under 67 that kept them close to tournament leader Jerry Kelly, who remained in sole possession of the lead despite making bogeys on two of his final four holes to close with a second consecutive round of even par and a 54-hole total of 2-under 208.
   
 Austin, Parel and Colin Montgomerie share second place at 1-under 209 and Miguel Angel Jimenez, one of the first-round leaders and one of six winners in this abbreviated season, was alone in fifth place at 211.
   
 Heading into Sunday's final 18 holes there are 14 players within 6 shots of the lead and some of them carry dangerous credentials. Guys like Ernie Els, Fred Couples, Bernhard Langer and Steve Stricker. Austin, Els, Couples and Langer are in the top five of the Tour Champions scoring leaders this season. Langer, second on the money list, won the Cologuard Classic in early March and Els won the Hoag Classic one week later.
   
 Austin, seventh on the money list, began the day 4 shots behind Kelly but got within 1 shot with nines of 33-34 with just one 3-putt bogey and four birdies.
   
 "I really played good today," he said. "Reminded me of a 30- something kid that used to hit it pretty good. I drove it really well. And all my good irons kept going and I hit it really close. I actually to a point, that's probably the worst score I could have shot. I mean, I really played solid."
   
 Parel, winner of this year's Chubb Classic in February and in the hunt in this event last year until the final four holes, had an up-and-down round with five birdies and three bogeys to make up for his 4-stroke deficit at day's outset. He admitted a love of the South Course.
   
 "Because it's tough," he said. "I did get some lucky breaks, but you're not going to get a whole lot of luck out there. You really have to strike the ball well. I haven't driven the ball that great. I missed a bunch of fairways, but I put myself -- even when you miss the fairways if you miss them in the right spot to where you can at least run it up -- that's what I think is fair about this place. It is penal if you miss off the tee, but it usually gives you a chance to recover if you miss it in the rough in the right spot."
   
 Despite there being just four of 78 players under par, Kelly feels someone is capable of going low.
   
 "There's a 5, 6 or 7 under out there, no question," he said. "It just hasn't been done yet but I definitely can see it."
   
 Kelly had three birdies and one bogey on the front nine to get to 4 under for the tournament at the turn but the back nine wasn't as productive.
   
 "I got a little loose on the backside for the second day in a row and got out of position and made some bogeys," he said. "I'm glad I made at least one birdie back there. I could have made two or three more birdies, I was burning some edges. You're going to make mistakes out here, I know that. I just need to make birdies to counteract the mistakes and live with the mistakes."

Live the life of a marauding Viking: sail, trade, manage armies and fleets of boats, and then get stuck into some third-person combat when the need arises. It's The Viking Way, an upcoming sandbox sim that looks on the surface to be a lot like Mount and Blade but with a lot of axes and extra pillaging.
 The game promises "groundbreaking naval combat" in addition to detailed trading systems and, of course, lots of conquest. There is a story mode that involves completing missions for NPCs to become "the most powerful Viking leader", but it looks as though you can freely sail around the world building a Viking empire, via peaceful means or otherwise.
 There are RPG elements too as you build your chief into the best Viking he can be. You can "attribute skill points" and "loot legendary medieval weapons". There are also hidden questlines that can lead you to ancient loot, just be sure to tip the bartenders well to get the best rumours.
 The game is due to arrive on Steam Early Access soon, and the developers plan to keep it there for 18 months so they can gather feedback and tweak accordingly.
 According to Ice Lava Games "the full version will have a complete campaign mode with numerous NPC characters, quests, an extended overworld map, more weapons, units, and naval vessels. The final version will also have improved skirmish, naval and siege combat."
 For more, take a look at the official site.

Browns veteran offensive lineman Joel Bitonio might be the man in the middle during the early part of the season, but even with center JC Tretter sidelined, he won't be playing that position.
   
 Bitonio, a two-time Pro Bowl left guard, finds himself mentoring two rookies -- center Nick Harris and left tackle Jedrick Wills.
   
 Tretter had knee surgery Thursday. He has a good chance to return in time for the Browns' Sept. 13 season opener against the Baltimore Ravens, though that remains uncertain, a league source said.
   
 "He's seen a lot of defenses and a lot of fronts. He knows how to make those calls and, you know, bring that experience," Bitonio said of Tretter. "You bring that rookie center in like Nick, he has talent, he can move and do that well, but he just hasn't been exposed to as many of the looks that we're going to see. So it's up to me and [right guard] Wyatt [Teller] and [right tackle] Jack Conklin and those guys and [quarterback] Baker [Mayfield] to help him along as much as possible."
   
 Harris, a 6-foot-1, 302-pound fifth-round draft choice, currently fills Tretter's role with the first-team offense, and, barring injury, that is unlikely to change.
   
 "So far, so good. All of these young players, it is never perfect, and they are constantly learning." Browns coach Kevin Stefanski said via Zoom after practice Sunday. "It is going to be a tough go early for these guys just as they are taking in all of the information and then the physicality picks up. I would not single Nick out from anybody else. Just know that those guys, there are growing pains to this. We totally understand that. It is our job to push them and make sure he is ready to roll if he is the guy."
   
 Bitonio said he considers it a good sign Tretter has been at team headquarters since having surgery, but the Browns are preparing for the worst-case scenario should his recovery be delayed. And Bitonio will be the linchpin should he be forced into the role of tutor.
   
 Wills' preparation would certainly be helped if defensive end Myles Garrett were not currently out with a hamstring injury.
   
 "Jed's going to have a big test," Bitonio said. "Right now, he still has guys like [defensive end Olivier Vernon] out there, who's a great player in his own right, so he's still getting challenged. It's good because practice is going to be faster than the game. It's already faster than the game. Then you get Myles, too, and then it's really going to step up. And once we get to the games, hopefully it slows down for him a little bit."
   
 Stefanski understands what having Garrett in there can do for Wills, but said he has confidence Vernon can challenge the rookie from the University of Alabama, who is transitioning from right to left tackle.
   
 "I think that is great when you get good against good. I think that will only help Jedrick in his development," he said. "I talked to Olivier today, and we're pushing Jed and he's part of that. He's getting his work in, but we definitely like the idea that Jed is facing off with a good, veteran player."
   
 Stefanski acknowledged the importance of Bitonio's presence.
   
 "Joel is a pro. Very impressed by Joel on a personal level, as well. I think he's an outstanding teammate, and he has some pelts on the wall," he said. "He has played in a bunch of games, so I think that always helps when you are breaking in a rookie next to him at left tackle.
   
 "I think that Jed is very lucky to have a player of Joel's caliber but also just the type of person he is. I think that's going to be a really good relationship. I really think that group as whole, with [offensive line] coach [Bill] Callahan and how he runs that group, they have to play together. ... It's the old 'five of them make up a fist,' and Joel is a very big piece of that in making sure we have the right mentality for that group."
   
 Bitonio on Mayfield
   
 As a seven-year veteran, Bitonio's opinion carries significant weight among his peers. It's likely they will take note of what he's had to say about Mayfield, who recently confessed to having lost himself last season.
   
 Mayfield said he spoke with his teammates about that, pledging to do better, something Bitonio confirmed.
   
 "And then from a leadership perspective this year he has done everything right," Bitonio said. "He's trying to lead by example. Just looking at him when he showed up, he looked a lot better. His body looked better. He looked like he was moving really well. He looked strong. All the things you want to see in a quarterback."
   
 Bitonio said the body change and other things could have just been offseason talk.
   
 "But he really did take those steps. That is the first arc, lead by example, and then as a quarterback you automatically lead with your voice because you are the quarterback of this team," he said. "Just taking that step, you see him talking to some of the young receivers, or even Odell [Beckham Jr.] and Jarvis [Landry] and Nick [Chubb] and guys that have been around. We have a standard here now and that standard can change, and as the quarterback of this team, you are the standard. You are what people follow, and I think he understands that now. We are ready to help him push that standard."
   
 Under the lights
   
 Stefanski said getting in practices at FirstEnergy Stadium is a priority for the team, and he plans to do so later on in training camp.
   
 "We do want to get down there. We have two of them planned in the stadium later in camp. I think that is going to be important for us," he said. "We will put the players through a lot of game-like situations. That will be one of the ideas in getting to the stadium, getting used to the locker room and making it as much game-like as we can."
   
 Roster moves
   
 The Browns waived undrafted rookie guard Jovahn Fair and signed center Casey Dunn on Sunday.
   
 Fair is an Akron native and Firestone High School graduate who signed with the Browns on Aug. 10. Fair played at Temple University and signed with Kansas City Chiefs this offseason before being waived and signing with the Browns.
   
 Dunn appeared in two games for Washington in 2018 and finished the 2019 season on the practice squad of the New Orleans Saints. Dunn was with new Browns offensive line coach Bill Callahan in Washington.
      
 Hair club for men
   
 Bitonio returned to the Browns with a beard that would make members of the blues-rock group ZZ Top envious. He grew the jungle of hair while enduring the coronavirus pandemic and assorted restrictions on daily life.
   
 "I'm going to keep it," Bitonio said. "I don't have to keep it. It's good right now. It hasn't bothered me too much. We'll see what happens."

Facebook said in a statement Monday that it prohibits hate speech and content that incites violence and enforces these rules globally “without regard to anyone’s political position or party affiliation.”
 Modi’s party leaders have come under scrutiny for running online campaigns laced with false claims or with vitriolic attacks on India’s minority Muslim population, posting videos or images that range from accusing Muslims of converting Hindu girls to Islam to intentionally spreading the coronavirus.
 A 2019 analysis by Equality Labs, a South Asia research organization, showed that groups sharing anti-Muslim content on Facebook were supporters of Modi’s party or were linked to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, a Hindu nationalist paramilitary volunteer organization and the ideological parent of the BJP.
 The controversy comes as Facebook and Jio, India's cheapest and most popular phone service provider, await a green light from India's Supreme Court to roll out WhatsApp Pay, an e-commerce and digital payments platform poised to help the social media behemoth further penetrate India's trillion-dollar digital market.
 Facebook invested $5.7 billion in cash in Reliance Jio, a subsidiary of Reliance Industries, whose chairman, Mukesh Ambani, is India’s richest man.
 “They’re pandering to the ruling party in India because they see this as a good business opportunity. They’re not concerned about the ethics of what is put out on Facebook. They’re in it for making money,” said political commentator Paranjoy Guha Thakurta, the author of a 2019 book on Facebook in India.

He might be the only man in the field -- heck, on the entire grounds of Firestone Country Club -- to be wearing a Kent State University visor.
   
 And, it's a safe bet to say he's the only man in the field with KSU head covers on several of his clubs, compliments of a visit to the annual tent sale at Windmill Lakes Golf Club on Wednesday.
   
 If this were any other time, meaning without the coronavirus and the ban on spectators, there is no doubt David Morland IV would have had a strong gallery behind him during the Bridgestone Senior Players Championship.
   
 Kent State guys are like that.
   
 "I passed up full scholarship offers to take a half-scholarship to Kent and it was the best decision I ever made," Morland said. "I'm still in contact with a lot of my former teammates."
   
 Yep, that's a Kent State guy, all right.
   
 Alas, bans happen and Morland has maneuvered his way through 54 holes with only his caddie, playing partners and scorekeeper alongside.
   
 Morland, 51, was part of one of the greatest teams in KSU history. It began in the fall of 1991 and each member of the starting five went on to become professionals after becoming one of coach Herb Page's 17 teams to qualify for the NCAA Tournament.
   
 "That was the team that really put us on the national map," said Page, now the university's director of golf. "They were really good and David was the ultimate team player, the ultimate grinder and super competitive."
   
 Morland's professional career has followed that path. He continues to chase the dream, surviving the ups and downs.
   
 Coming out of North Bay, Ontario, he turned pro shortly after graduating in 1991 and has been grinding ever since. He played four years on the PGA Tour and had his best season in 2002 when he had three top-10 finishes, including a tie for fifth in the Canadian Open. He spent time on the Nationwide Tour and the Canadian Tour.
   
 He has three professional wins on his resume and gained entrance into the Players Championship thanks mostly to a tie for seventh -- after an opening 61 -- in the Hoag Classic in Newport Beach in March.
   
 His round on Saturday mirrored his career. His first two rounds were 76-75, leaving him at 11-over 151 and in a tie for 52d. Starting the third round on the back nine, he reeled off 13 consecutive pars before bogeys on the 200-yard fifth and the 482-yard eighth dropped him to 13-over 223.
   
 The names of his former teammates are familiar to golf fans in Northeast Ohio:
   
 Brian Bridges grew up in Columbus, played on several tours and now is the general manager and head professional at Chapel Hill Golf Course in Mount Vernon.
   
 Rob Moss grew up in Broadview Heights and had success on the Asian Tour, has been a major force in the Northern Ohio PGA as a three-time winner of the Ohio Open. He and is now in his 12th year as head professional at the Pepper Pike Club.
   
 Steve Parker grew up in West Akron and is in his fifth year as the head professional at Portage Country Club after one year at Firestone and several years at Wanakah Country Club in Buffalo, New York.
   
 Rob Wakeling also grew up in West Akron, played professionally for several years in the United States and overseas and served for several years as Page's assistant. He has regained his amateur status and competes locally.
   
 So, it has been a good week for Morland, who leads the field in fairways hit. He visited with Page and had dinner with a few of his ex-teammates. He has shaved strokes off his score every round and will earn a paycheck tomorrow.
   
 The grind continues.

Sokoto has an estimated population of 5.3 million people with about 4.5 million without health insurance. In efforts to ensure the actualization of universal health coverage for the indigent, poor and vulnerable, the scheme has been a life saver and makes the state the only in the whole of the north with a contributory health insurance programme. According to Dr Shehu Balarabe Kakale, commissioner for health (2015 – 2019), “establishment of SOCHEMA Agency with a legally binding Bill is the greatest achievement under this present administration led by Rt. Hon. Aminu Waziri Tambuwal CFR. It is a legacy that I am proud to live behind as the commissioner of health, I believe it is a machinery of reforming and a revolution of healthcare services towards minimizing out of pocket spending to the barest minimum for the attainment of a sound Universal Health Coverage in our Communities”. The Scheme has since expanded to cover students of tertiary institutions in the state. To deeply position the health systems in the state for quality and quantum performance, Governor Tambuwal launched a streak of quality assurance initiatives within the health sector of the state. It included strengthening of Disease Surveillance and Emergency Response Unit, akin to what is obtainable in advanced societies with emphasis on diseases prevention rather than on curative. The activities carried out through a system of networking between Federal, State and Local Government Areas, has been very useful in curtailing the spread of Gastro-Enteritis, Measles, CSM and Malaria in the state. Malaria an endemic disease in the tropical zone to which Nigeria belongs got additional attention under the quality assurance initiatives with the establishment of Malaria Control Agency, the first of its kind in the North West geo-political zone.

In fact, when looking at the Anadarko deal I noted that the strategy was dangerous given the commitment to "win" the deal, leverage assumed and high break-up fee being offered. As has happened in the past, focus on a deal and size was more important to executives than the actual underlying economics, certainly regarding risk.
 ## The Thoughts
 Shares of Occidental have fallen from levels in the $60s when the Anadarko acquisition was announced in 2019, to $40-$50 at the start of the year, only to fall to levels in the mid-teens in mid-March. In fact, shares lost nearly three quarters of their values in just a few weeks' time.
 Occidental reported 2019 results late February as it reported a net debt load of $35 billion, excluding other multi-billion liabilities as well. The nearly 900 million shares represented an equity value of less than $15 billion by Mid-March, for an enterprise value of $50 billion, less than the valuation of both Occidental or Anadarko when the deal was announced a year earlier.
 The company cut capital spending and the dividend in response to the turmoil, yet quite frankly I would have welcomed a complete dividend elimination and further capital spending cuts in March. In the meantime, investors were given the opportunity to invest alongside prominent investors (which can be wrong as well) such as the likes of Warren Buffett and Carl Icahn who invested in the company, largely on the back of the fact that Occidental itself was a strong operator with low cost of production.
 Given the degree of uncertainty, I noted that the outcome would be uncertain, other than that volatility should be expected, yet debt could easily result in a scenario in which equity holders could be wiped out (which is still possible).
 What happened ever since? Later in March the company cut capital spending budgets further and reached an agreement with Carl Icahn. The company reported dismal first quarter results and a deal for Anadarko's assets in Africa by Total (NYSE:TOT) broke apart.

NEW DELHI (AP) — Members of India's governing party on Monday rejected allegations that Facebook had chosen to turn a blind eye to partisan hate speech on its platform to protect its growing business interests in India.
 As usage has spread across India, Facebook and its subsidiary WhatsApp have become fierce battlegrounds for India’s political parties, but spokesmen for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party denied a newspaper report that asserted Facebook officials chose not to take action against party members whose posts violated rules against hate speech.
 The party members instead accused Facebook of censoring pro-India content.
 Opposition Congress party lawmaker Shashi Tharoor said the information technology committee he heads in Parliament will take up the findings of the Aug. 14 report in The Wall Street Journal. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi accused the BJP of “controlling” Facebook and demanded a joint probe by Parliament's two houses.
 The Wall Street Journal report said Facebook India's head of public policy, Anhki Das, “opposed applying hate-speech rules” to at least four individuals and groups linked with the BJP even though they were “flagged internally for promoting or participating in violence.”
 Tejasvi Surya, a BJP lawmaker and a member of the parliamentary committee on IT, rejected the idea that Facebook was showing favoritism to the governing party, and instead charged it was “censoring pro-India and pro-Hindu voices.”
 “There are millions of posts mocking Hindu gods and abusing right-of-center leaders. But Facebook’s advanced algorithms and community standards fail to catch them. However, unsuspecting common people running pro-right-of-center pages are suspended with no right to appeal,” fellow BJP lawmaker Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore wrote in an op-ed in the Indian Express newspaper.

 An egg timer is difficult to find but is perhaps the most important. It helps students manage time but also allows you to set a limit on work sessions. It is very helpful with a student that has difficulty focusing for long periods of time. Three short work sessions with breaks in between are more productive than 30 minutes of arguing and threatening. A good rule of thumb, the shorter the attention span, the shorter the work period.
 Arm yourself with these tools of the trade. Keep them handy and ready. Your work sessions will be more productive and enjoyable. The end result is less stress, and we all can use less stress.

From 1997 to 2001 Danny Sahl built a reputation as one of the many multi- talented golfers to come out of Kent State.
   
 Today he is building a reputation as a valued caddie on the Professional Golfers Association tours.
   
 For the past three years he has carried the bag of Vijay Singh and has been at Singh's side this week in the Bridgestone Seniors Players Championship at Firestone Country Club.
   
 Sahl, one of the numerous Canadian players recruited by Canadian native Herb Page, enrolled at KSU out of Alberta, joining a lineup that included Ben Curtis, current KSU coach Jon Mills and Mike Simpson among others.
   
 "That team won a lot of tournaments," said Page, now the director of golf at the university. "They were a great team, one of our best."
   
 And, Sahl was arguably the best at the time. He won the Mid-American Conference championship as a sophomore. Curtis won the following year as a senior and Mills the year after that, also as a senior.
   
 "So, how good was Danny Sahl?" Page asked rhetorically.
   
 Page first saw Sahl compete at the Hudson Junior and got another look at another big-time junior event. Less than one year later Sahl committed to KSU.
   
 "So, after Danny committed I went to the Junior Nationals to watch him again," Page recalled. "I went down to the range and there's a bunch of college coaches watching Danny pound balls and trying to get a look at his bagtags to see who he is. I just smiled."
   
 Page said he has been told by several people that Sahl should give playing professionally another try. Sahl did not downplay the idea.
   
 "You know, the older we get, the wiser we get," he said during the two-hour weather delay that plagued Sunday's final round. "I've finally been able to get back in shape. I'm probably stronger than I've ever been and I'm hitting it far. I am going to try and play in some tournaments back home. We'll see how it goes."
   
 Sahl, 40, credits Singh for his rejuvenation. They frequently work out together and play golf together. Sahl lived in Singh's Ponte Vedra Beach condo during the last four months of the pandemic.
   
 "We have our routine," he said. "Vijay likes to work hard and he's always been a workhorse. And, I like to work hard as well. So, that has been a benefit for me."
   
 Sahl says Singh's reputation of being difficult to work for has not been the case.
   
 "That's old news," he said. "First off, he is a really good guy. He respects me for what I know. He realizes that I have a good understanding about the game. I really enjoy it," Sahl stated of working for the 54-year-old. "He is so knowledgeable. I've learned a lot just by being around him."
   
 Singh and Sahl arrived in Canton about two weeks ago and have played plenty of golf together.
   
 "We played 176 holes last week," Sahl said.
   
 They played Firestone's three courses several times, as well as Canterbury and Canton Brookside.
   
 Sahl turned professional shortly after graduating and played the Canadian Tour several years. His best season came in 2011 when he won the Syncrude Boreal Open in Fort McMurray, Alta., and finished ninth on the tour's Order of Merit.
   
 Then came the slide and Sahl turned to caddying as a way to stay connected.
   
 "I practiced but I didn't practice the way I should have," he said. "Now, I have a much better understanding of the way I should practice. Becoming a caddie gave me the chance of staying with the game at its highest level."
   
 Sahl caddied for Curtis when he finished 12 th in the Western Open, which got him into the Open Championship. The lack of a passport prevented Sahl from traveling to Royal St. Georges and being there when Curtis shocked the world.
   
 He eventually hooked up with fellow Canadian Mike Weir and spent three years with the lefty before switching to Corey Connors.
   
 A mutual friend led to linking up with Singh.
   
 It has been a great ride. He has caddied in five Masters, three PGA Championships, one U.S. Open, one Players Championship and four Senior Players Championships. He was on the bag when Singh won the 2018 Seniors Players. That's 14 majors.
   
 "Life is good for me," he said reflectively. "I've traveled all over and have been able to stay connected to the game I love. Yeah, life is good."

“We are going back to school,” Block said. “So some of the traditions that I think we've probably all grown up with, whether it's cleaning out our kids' rooms, whether it's deciding how to organize our schoolwork, getting a few new school supplies, getting haircuts, I would really encourage people to do those things. It's a ritual that we understand that helps us frame the fact that we are going back to school. It sets the tone.”
 Setting the tone is an apt description. It’s up to parents to help kids select the right attitude about work. After a summer of more relaxed rules and perhaps unregulated screen time, it would be easy for those summer habits to bleed into school time. What’s the harm in playing a video game during that busy Zoom class? Plenty.
 “I think we need to help kids recognize this is their work right now,” Block said. “It’s no less important and it’s no less serious even though we’re doing it from home. You have expectations that you will do their homework, that you will turn it in. Your goal is to learn stuff.”
 Enforcing a structure — for the day, for school, for free time and chore time — will make things easier, for adults and kids. But it also comes with some steep hurdles that not everyone will want to clear.
 “Anybody who's worked from home realizes that your workday kind of bleeds into evening and you're never really done,” Block said. “And screens are on all the time. I feel like it's going to be important for us to decide as individuals and families when to turn off the screens. Like, this is your work time and this is play time — screens off, outside — to keep up the energy.”
 Outside? You remember that concept. It will be no less important this year. School-age children need to move at least 60 minutes a day. Be creative in the way you tick off those minutes and your daily routine might not be so onerous.
 “If they're tethered to a computer for six hours, maybe dance for lunch breaks or use that as an opportunity to get outside,” Block said. “There are ways to be social and to be safe. Take a weekly hike or a walk with friends or kick a soccer ball around. That's the sort of thing that would be helpful to us to stay healthy throughout this year.”

Against that background, it’s unclear how heated things may get between now and November, while the provocations mount:
 The Trump administration on Friday approved the sale of F-16 military jets to Taiwan, and the president ordered the Chinese owner of the TikTok to sell its U.S. assets after a review of the national security dangers posed by the popular music video app. The president earlier this month moved to ban WeChat, a popular social networking and mobile payment app developed by Chinese Internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd.
 Trump on Saturday boasted about the actions he’s taken against Huawei Technologies, including jawboning other countries into avoiding the Chinese firm’s products, and didn’t rule out actions against other companies. While he didn’t elaborate, those comments are sure to keep markets on edge. The President’s Working Group on Financial Markets this month said U.S. stock exchanges should set new rules that could trigger the delisting of Chinese companies.
 The administration has also taken a markedly tough stance against Beijing’s crackdown on political and press freedoms in Hong Kong, including the recent sanctions on a range of officials, and China’s treatment of ethnic minorities. Although bilateral trade talks seem to be on hold for now, Trump said China is buying large amounts of U.S. corn, soybeans and cattle. "China has been buying a lot of — a lot of things, and they’re doing that to keep me happy,” he said Saturday.
 Even so, he said, China’s government would prefer that he lose in November to Democrat Joe Biden. On Sunday he retweeted a Twitter post from a Republican aide noting that Biden and running mate Kamala Harris "didn’t mention China a single time” in their joint announcement last week.

Jimmy and Dee Haslam hope Gov. Mike DeWine will allow some fans to attend Browns home games amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
   
 And no matter who's watching and where, the owners of the Browns vowed to support their players if they decide to kneel during the national anthem to protest social and racial injustice.
   
 The Haslams said Sunday during a Zoom video conference they have yet to receive a final answer from DeWine about whether fans will be permitted in the stands at FirstEnergy Stadium.
   
 The Browns are scheduled to open the season Sept. 13 in Baltimore, then face Cincinnati on Sept. 17 in the home opener on the lakefront.
   
 "Is there a way to make this work?" Jimmy Haslam said after the second full- squad practice of training camp. "We get it that not having 65,000 people down there eight games is a major blow to a lot of people that work at the stadium and all the businesses around there. Dee and I had dinner with another couple last night and his office is downtown. He just talked about how there's nobody down there.
   
 "So the sooner we can safely get people back to work, the better off we're going to do. We're going to do everything we can at the Browns and would encourage other businesses to do the same. At the same time, at the end of the day, it's not our call about how many fans we have in the stands on Sunday or if we have fans in the stands. We want it to happen for our players and for those fans."
   
 Jimmy Haslam used his annual training camp media availability to implore Browns fans to wear masks, practice social distancing and wash their hands to combat the coronavirus.
   
 "If everybody will do that, we have a chance at having an NFL season, a high school season and all of the other things we want to see happen," he said. "If we're not smart about it, then it will not happen.
   
 "None of us know if there's going to be a full season, but we're going to do everything we can [as an organization] to get a season in, but do so in a safe manner."
   
 The seating capacity at FirstEnergy Stadium is 67,895.
   
 "We've put a lot of time, effort and resources into ensuring that if we did have quote 20% fans, it could be a safe experience," Jimmy Haslam said. "We feel good about that opportunity. Obviously, the final decision is up to the governor, but we're ready and excited to go, and I think the city of Cleveland feels the same way."
   
 Dee Haslam described the atmosphere at training camp as "really strange" because fans aren't permitted.
   
 "We really missed the fans," she said. "It has made a big difference not having them out there with us."
   
 Speaking of fans, the Browns are prepared for any negative reaction they might receive from their followers who disagree with players kneeling during the anthem. Quarterback Baker Mayfield has already vowed to kneel, something many Browns players did in 2017.
   
 "One of the great things about this country, one of the many great things, is the ability to have freedom of speech and being able to express yourself, so we're going to support our players," Jimmy Haslam said. "At the same time, I think all too much attention is called to whether somebody kneels or stands or what their statement is and not nearly enough attention is called to what they do afterward.
   
 "Dee and I can issue some great statement, but what you all really ought to look at is what ourselves, our coaches and our players are doing the rest of the week, if you will, to make this country a better place to live, work and raise a family."
   
 Dee Haslam commended General Manager Andrew Berry for developing the team's #BeTheSolution campaign, which encourages people to educate themselves on social and racial justice issues before taking action aimed at positive societal change.
   
 "One of the unfortunate things in the country today is that there's not enough thoughtful dialogue like, 'Baker, tell me why you think it's important?'" Jimmy Haslam said. "Or if so-and-so is not kneeling, 'Tell me why you're not kneeling.'
   
 "There's just all of this condemnation from one side versus the other, rather than everybody trying to understand, 'Well, why is that important to you, Baker? You're a thoughtful young man. You understand the ramifications.' We're going to be fully supportive of our players, no matter what they decide to do. We just ask that, as a country, we have a lot more thoughtful dialogue."
   
 Since being hired in January, Berry and coach Kevin Stefanski have not only had to guide the Browns through the nation's reaction to the killing of George Floyd, but also a global health crisis.
   
 Jimmy Haslam mentioned that two people who worked for his family's business, Pilot Co., died of COVID-19. The Haslams stressed the Browns have done everything in their power to keep everyone safe at team headquarters in Berea and praised Berry and Stefanski for adapting during an unprecedented offseason.
   
 "They're both like really calm, really calm. Their EKGs are [steady]," Jimmy Haslam said. "Second of all, they're really organized, really organized. They're good at processing. They're both smart.
   
 "What I appreciate the most is neither of them use COVID as an excuse. Kevin can easily do that, right? First-year head coach, new staff, new offense, new defense, et cetera, and he has not used it as an excuse."
   
 The Haslams said Berry, Stefanski and Chief Strategy Officer Paul DePodesta have demonstrated the organizational alignment ownership sought. Previous regimes have been plagued by infighting and dysfunction.
   
 Jimmy Haslam said "it's a lot more fun" when team brass works well together.
   
 "It has been particularly important during this COVID season," Dee Haslam added.

COLOGNE - Manchester United have little time to dwell on a third semifinal defeat of a 13-month season after Ole Gunnar Solskjaer admitted they let Sevilla "off the hook" to miss out on Friday's Europa League final.
 Solskjaer was desperate for a trophy, United's first since 2017, as tangible reward for the improvement the Red Devils have made in 2020 and to cement his status as the man to lead the club forward.
 A 2-1 defeat in the heat of Cologne on Sunday night was just United's second in 25 games, a run which has at least ensured a return to the Champions League next season.
 The much-needed income that will bring, even for a commercial behemoth like United, is especially welcome given the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic and will help as Solskjaer aims to build a squad capable of taking the Premier League title fight to Liverpool and Manchester City next season.
 United’s progress and problems were on show in equal measure in their 59th game of the season.
 Bruno Fernandes continued his perfect record from the penalty spot since his January signing turned United's season around to give the English side an early lead.
 Even after Suso levelled for Europa League specialists Sevilla, United should have been out of sight early in the second half as Bono denied Anthony Martial three times in one-on-ones, while Fernandes and Marcus Rashford also saw chances come and go.
 When Sevilla knocked United out of the Champions League two years ago in a tie that signalled the beginning of the end for Jose Mourinho's reign at Old Trafford, it was David de Gea who was the busier goalkeeper.
 That Bono was Sevilla's hero with eight saves shows that on another night United would have won comfortably.
 But after the Spaniards struggled to get out their own half in the first 10 minutes of the second half, Julen Lopetegui turned to his bench to change the game.
 Luuk de Jong and Munir El Haddadi offered more physicality and pace as an out ball to release the pressure and De Jong ghosted in behind Victor Lindelof to net the winner 12 minutes from time, provoking Fernandes to point the finger at the Swedish defender on the pitch.
 Despite the energy-sapping conditions, a long season and the need for a goal, Solskjaer did not make his first change until three minutes from time.
 The Norwegian admitted afterwards United "need to strengthen the squad depth" ahead of what will be an unprecedented season with four competitions plus internationals crammed into an eight-month schedule.
 United will be back in pre-season training in two weeks and could begin their Premier League campaign in less than a month.
 "I cannot say when or if transfers are going to be done, but we are looking at it. It is a quick turnaround. We just have to be 100 percent sure when we do those deals," added Solskjaer.
 Initial talks over the signing of Jadon Sancho have stalled with Borussia Dortmund insisting the England international will remain in Germany next season after United failed to match their reported asking price of 120 million euros.
 Lindelof's error highlighted the need for a more reliable centre-back partner for Harry Maguire, while Solskjaer seems to have little faith in Dan James, Juan Mata or Odion Ighalo to deputise for Rashford, Martial or wonder kid Mason Greenwood.
 "We know what it means to play for this club: losing isn't acceptable. Getting to semi-finals isn't acceptable. We've got to now really concentrate on taking it further, taking another step," said Maguire, who cost a world record £80 million for a defender a year ago.
 United have not been shy in spending money in recent years, but have not always done so wisely.
 Smart and speedy recruitment is now needed to ensure a promising few months does not fizzle out into another false dawn in the club's decline since Alex Ferguson retired as manager in 2013.
