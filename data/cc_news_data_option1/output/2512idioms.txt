NEW BEDFORD -- Discontent with how budget decisions are impacting the New Bedford Fire Department has spread beyond the New Bedford Firefighters IAFF Local 841 to a neighboring firefighters' union.
 On June 12, after the Fairhaven Fire Department provided mutual aid for two fires in the city within three days, Fairhaven Firefighters Association Local 1555 posted a statement to Facebook criticizing New Bedford Mayor Jon Mitchell.
 "The Mayor cuts NBFD staffing and apparatus and the Town of Fairhaven ends up supplementing the City. Costs associated with mutual aid come out of our budget," the post reads, "We're always willing to help our neighbors. But when that assistance is due to the [Mayor's] lack of proper funding for his Fire Department, it's not really fair to our own taxpayers."
 Local 1555 President Edward Freitas said whenever Fairhaven responds to mutual aid calls, the department has to call people in from home to man their stations and that has an added cost for the town's department.
 The city of New Bedford announced it would decommission Engine 11 in the South End in March and Freitas said shortages like that and underfunding NBFD's budget leave surrounding department's to pick up the slack.
 "We end up supplementing NBFD's budget," Freitas said, "As far as mutual aid goes, the surrounding communities provide more coverage than what they receive. In fact, Fairhaven, Dartmouth and Acushnet provide more coverage than what they receive combined and then some."
 But Fairhaven Fire Chief Timothy Francis said at the end of the day costs from mutual aid balance out, noting that the NBFD provided mutual aid during the Jackson's Variety fire on Sconticut Neck in February and other community's departments offer mutual aid on a weekly basis with ambulances.
 "We're always depending on other communities to help us... every city and town relies on [mutual aid]," Francis said.
 When asked if his department has provided more mutual aid to New Bedford this year than in the past, Francis said he wouldn't say they've provided any more than normal.
 Francis did say New Bedford, as a city, has more fires than the town of Fairhaven, but that the city doesn't call them to every single fire.
 Francis also said while the FFD provided mutual aid twice in one week, they hadn't needed to come into the city for a long time before that.
 "Mutual aid is a common arrangement," New Bedford Public Information Officer Jonathan Carvalho said in an email. "The New Bedford Fire Department also provides aid to surrounding towns, including Fairhaven. New Bedford has a population of 100,000 and Fairhaven is a small town with about 15,000 residents; it is more common for larger cities to require coverage due to their larger populations and thus more frequent incidents."
 Both fires Fairhaven provided mutual aid for last week were two-alarm fires.
 According to Carvalho, in the event of a two-alarm fire, there will be a need for mutual aid assistance, which has been the case as far back as when the NBFD had 10 companies.
 Local 841 president Billy Sylvia said New Bedford is cutting the fire department's budget to save money, all the while putting the burden on surrounding communities to spend money to help cover fires in New Bedford.
 Sylvia described cuts to the fire department's budget as "passing the buck to everybody else" and said he brought up the pressure the cuts would put on surrounding department's before.
 Following a general alarm fire at Sid Wainer and Son in March, Sylvia put out a statement that said when the general alarm was called it left no other fire apparatus available to respond to other emergencies in the city and other departments had to come in and cover the city as a whole.
 "This action takes the issue of not having a fully operational department and shares that with the departments that come in to help while leaving their own town with less Emergency Services available," Sylvia wrote.
 Freitas said during the Amanda Avenue fire on June 10 he was providing mutual aid at New Bedford Fire Department's headquarters.
 "I was shocked to learn that we were covering the whole downtown area, all the way to engine 8's coverage area and we were also covering the entire South End, Buttonwood Park and up to the Dartmouth line," Freitas said, "One engine as well as a Dartmouth ladder was covering that entire area. The citizens of New Bedford were terribly unprotected during that fire."
 Fire Chief Paul Coderre has said in the past that response times in the South End are still within National Standards following the decommissioning of Engine 11.
 While he was providing mutual aid, Freitas said they were called to respond to a motorcycle accident and while they were initially responding to it, though they ended up being canceled by New Bedford EMS, the nearest coverage station for the South End was Downtown.
 Freitas said they had one Fairhaven engine and one ladder truck from Dartmouth at station 2.
 "Any fire you have, you want to have two pumpers there, we didn't have that," Freitas said, "The South End used to be covered by two pumpers and a ladder now its being covered by one pumper ... I don't think citizens understand how bad the coverage is for them right now."
 When the city initially announced it would be decommissioning Engine 11 the city's CFO Ari Sky said it would cost the city $2.7 million to fully fund all 10 fire companies and the cost is beyond the city's financial means. This was before revenue loss due to the coronavirus restrictions put added pressure on the city's finances.
 A public safety center is scheduled to open in the South End in spring of next year.

Howard told _The Wolverine_ that Hinton is "night and day" a different player now than he was one year ago.
 How did he get there?
 Good old fashioned hard work.
 Hinton was making strides in winter conditioning and was ready to show more of what he can do in spring practices, which were set to begin on March 17. During spring break at the beginning of that month, while other students were vacationing or relaxing at home, Hinton was preparing.
 "We worked his whole spring break," Howard said. "That’s the difference between some guys and him. That’s why I believe he’s going to make it. As soon as he came home for spring break on Friday, he was with me in the gym on Sunday."
 Just two days after classes resumed following spring recess, the world was flipped upside down due to the coronavirus outbreak. U-M classes were moved online, the football building was shut down and spring practices were cancelled.
 Soon after the news hit and players headed home, Hinton picked up the phone to call Howard. It was time to get back to work down in the Atlanta area.
 "He hit me up at the end like later on that week and said I’m 'bout to come back home to work some more," Howard said.

In the annals of Hindi film music, maestros are a plenty but no music composer has held such a sway over minds and hearts of Indians as Rahul Dev Burman. Son of equally legendary film composer Sachin Dev Burman, Rahul is a rare example of how sons of famous fathers can be just as successful and, like Pancham, as he was popularly called, stay on in public memory for much longer.The only son of Sachin and Meena Dev Burman (Das Gupta), Pancham was born in Kolkata (then Calcutta) on June 27, 1939. Not just his father, his mother too was a singer and dancer, having studied music at Shanti Niketan. Pancham was nicknamed so because as child he would cry in the fifth degree of the musical scale.Pancham is unique in modern Indian musical history as he stands at the crossroads of the Indian and the Western styles. While AR Rahman would take this to another level, the man to blend this seamless marriage of the east and the west was Pancham. From late 1950s onwards, Pancham began assisting his father but it was in Chhote Nawab (1961) that he first composed music, independent of his father. While the music was appreciated, it didn't cause major ripples in the industry. Then in 1966, came Shammi Kapoor, Asha Parekh starrer Teesri Manzil. It is said that though in the past Shankar Jaikishan were the favoured music directors for Shammi Kapoor starrers, at the behest of Majrooh Sultanpuri (also the film's lyricist), director Nasir Hussain agreed to try out RD Burman. Needless to say, all the songs from the film turned out to be superhits, thus giving Pancham his first hit. A lull would follow but all the time he was busy assisting his father in films with hit music such as Prem Pujari and Jewel Thief. However, after the success of Teesri Manzil, Nasir Hussain would work with Pancham in as many as six films including hits such as Baharon Ke Sapne (1967), Pyar Ka Mausam (1969) and Yaadon Ki Baaraat (1973).   The best of Pancham was waiting the explode - the combination of RD Burman, Kishore Kumar, lyricist Anand Bakshi and Rajesh Khanna - would alter the music landscape completely. In fact, Pancham and Rajesh would collaborate in no less than 32 films. With hits in films like Kati Patang, Amar Prem, Namak Haraam, Aap Ki Kasam, Mere Jeevan Saathi, Mehbooba and Kudrat, the duo was an unbeatable combination.Tune in to any FM radio in the late night slot and Pancham's songs with dominate. A combination of melody, youthful fervour, frenetic pacing and foot-tapping rhythm meant Pancham has stayed in the hearts and minds of millions of Indians. Pancham was perhaps the first Indian musician to experiment with different genres and instruments. Think of sounds you will catch in his music - guitar, violin, santoor, sitar, cello, mandolin, tabla, dholak, bongo, chenda (percussion instrument from Kerala), pakhawaj, piano, accordion, electric organ, saxophone, trumpet, clarinet and shehnai to name a few.  Pancham was known to blend electronic rock into Indian melodies, mix disco and rock with Bangla folk music. In his music, he would bring in Latin, Oriental and Arabic music into Indian music systems with ease. What is magical about Pancham was his ability to find music in the most unmusical of things - he could make music by rubbing sandpaper, use cups and saucers to create the tinkling sound, knocking bamboo sticks or rubbing comb on rough surface, to name a few examples. As much as Pancham was the toast of the crowds in the '70s, come the '80s, the downfall as just as dramatic. The films for which he composed music flopped badly at the box office. It is said that Nasir Hussain, with whom he worked in no less than 6 films, dropped him from Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak. Subhash Ghai promised to take him for Ram Lakhan, only to pick Laxmikant Pyarelal later. It wasn't as if Pancham had stopped making good music--he was on the last leg of his musical journey, creating the most amazing melodies with Gulzar. But these were considered art-house music. The mainstream music lovers had changed gears and turned to Bappi Lahiri and other disco-oriented musicians.Pancham died of a heart attack aged only 54. He went in a flash but only after creating a splash in the pond - after his death his swan song, Vidhu Vinod Chopra's 1942 A Love Story's music was a super hit.Follow @htshowbiz for more

_Deadpool_ and _Deadpool 2_ co-star Morena Baccarin, who plays Wade Wilson's (Ryan Reynolds) fiancee Vanessa, says there have been "no conversations" on her end about _Deadpool 3_. Star and producer Reynolds first confirmed a threequel was in development at Marvel Studios in December 2019, months after parent company Disney acquired the _Deadpool_ and _X-Men_ properties as part of its $71.3 billion Fox purchase. Franchise scribes Paul Wernick and Rhett Reese previously admitted bringing the red-suited mercenary into the shared Marvel Cinematic Universe made scripting the third movie a "little more complicated than when we were at Fox," but added they're "ready to go" when given the green light by Reynolds and Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige.


  "I have no idea," Baccarin told _EW_ 's _Couch Surfing_ when asked if she has a bigger role in _Deadpool 3_. "Apparently, they're still writing it. I genuinely don't know. I have not been asked, or approached. There's been no conversations yet, so I'm waiting with bated breath."


  Baccarin had substantially less screen time in _Deadpool 2_ , where Wade fell into a dark depression after Vanessa was murdered by a vengeful drug lord (Thayr Harris). Wade would later prevent Vanessa's death with the use of a time-travel device stolen from Cable (Josh Brolin).


  If Vanessa is included in _Deadpool 3_ , Baccarin hopes the role is "as big as possible." Saying Reynolds "will always be the lead," she added, "I would love to be right by his side."


  Shooting the Tim Miller-directed first movie was "one of the best times of my life," Baccarin said. "It was so fun to be on that set, and it was creative, and fulfilling, and enjoyable all around. [Reynolds] is the best person to work with, and so sweet, and so damn funny it hurts."


  In 2018, Reese said the writers would consider evolving Vanessa into a super- powered character. In the Marvel Comics, Vanessa Carlysle is a shape-shifting mutant codenamed Copycat who joins X-Force, a team of militant mutants who are more lethal than their X-Men counterparts.

  "We're leaving that option open," Reese told _Entertainment Weekly_, where he confirmed Vanessa is alive at the end of _Deadpool 2_. "We certainly haven't made any decisions along those lines. But we always thought that might be a fun twist for her at some point."


  "The question is how to give her those powers without it feeling too coincidental. You have to iron out the logic if we go there," Reese added. "But why not? I think people would love to see Vanessa kicking ass."

PRATT-Every year, teams of wheat harvest crews come to Kansas to bring in the harvest from the nation's bread basket. Crews come to Kansas from states like Texas, Nebraska, Colorado to Iowa, North Dakota, Kansas and even Canada. Many crews make their way down U.S. Highway 281 through Pratt in May as harvest starts in Texas then move their way up through Oklahoma and into Kansas to spread out and bring in the wheat.


   


  Last week Greg and Sandy Beck, a husband and wife crew from Malcolm, Iowa, along with their constant companion "Tug" a miniature pincer started their harvest run in Pratt. When done in Pratt County they will head for the Jetmore area, then move north to Hermingford Neb. and end their run in either South Dakota or North Dakota, depending on the weather, Sandy said.


   


  Making the harvest run is relatively new for the Becks. They started in 2013 and stayed in South Dakota and North Dakota.Their children were grown and out of the house so they decided to give harvesting a try, Greg said.


   


  Outside of harvest, Sandy is an operations manufacturer for a soybean company. She produces many soybean based products including bread, handle bars, glass cleaner, grease cleaner, wheels for fork lifts and roller coasters and more. Greg manufactures pallets.


   


  Before becoming custom harvesters, they raised a lot of pigs. For a time, they were selling 1,000 head a week. The family did all the work with hardly any outside help. They also had crops and raised cattle in Iowa.


   


  Finding customers has always been the hardest part of the job. They used to start their harvest run in Vernon, Texas. But over the years, their customers in Texas were gone. One customer died, another switched to livestock and another planted everything to grass. So they decided to start in Kansas and not deal with finding new customers.


   


  The Becks started this years harvest in Pratt on June 15, working for Gary Barker. Harvest was going pretty good with moisture at 12 percent and wheat at 63 pounds a bushel with the benchmark at 60 pounds. Recent rain storms have caused delays in finishing cutting wheat.


   


  Greg said he loves farming and enjoys meeting the people along the way. That is why he likes going on the harvest run.


   


  "It gets in your blood. Every year its different," Greg said. "It's just something that grows on you."

With New York City crashing and burning in the late-1970's due to an exploding crime rate, the local tourism bureau brought Glaser and Wells Rich Greene on board to design a logo in an effort to bring more people to the city -- that project would lead to the brand which would become the ever-popular "I Heart NY" logo you've seen countless times throughout your life. In fact, one could say fewer brands have become more ingrained in pop culture than Glaser's creation.


  Due to the state of New York at the time, Glaser offered his services pro- bono to the state. According to the _Village Voice,_ the licensing of the logo made upwards of $1.83 million for the city in 2010.


  "I'm flabbergasted by what happened to this little, simple, nothing of an idea," Glaser told the _Voice_ in 2011. "It just demonstrates that every once in a while you do something that can have enormous consequences…it was a bunch of little scratches on a piece of paper! I am just astonished by the amount of money it's brought in. I went to Chinatown a few months ago, and it had been transformed to a gazillion "I Love New York" T-shirts on every building and facade. It amazes me."

  He added, "I'm also amazed by how indifferent the state is to all of that. When I did "I Love New York More Than Ever" [after 9/11], the state threatened to sue me -- they said I was infringing on the copyright. You realize when you're dealing with any bureaucracy that they're so indifferent to anyone but themselves."

KINGSTON - After deciding to skip her sophomore season of high school hockey to play junior hockey, Alyssa Murphy seemingly had little reason to return to the Whitman-Hanson/Silver Lake team in the following year. The Panthers hadn't won a single game in her absence. But she came back anyway, motivated by the opportunity to rejoin her friends.


  "I really missed the experience you get from playing high school sports and hanging out with my friends," she said. "Junior hockey is not quite the same. But junior hockey definitely helped my speed and my quickness, and shaped me into a better player."


  With Murphy as their captain and catalyst, the Panthers reached the state tournament this winter. A three-time Patriot League all-star, Murphy scored 32 goals last season and ended her career with 78 goals and 124 points.


  "She was one of the best players in our league," Head Coach Kevin Marani said. "She has a cannon of a shot, is a great stick-handler, a strong skater and a great leader. She's just a coach's dream."


  Murphy, who attended Silver Lake, called her final game with the Panthers "so emotional" and was thrilled to help them reach the state tournament. "We had to win two of our final three games to get into the tournament, and we were all on the same page. Everyone was so motivated," she said.


  "She just carried us on her back every game," Marani said. "Every team knew that if they shut her down, they had a pretty good chance of beating us, and she would just fight through it."


  It had long been her dream to play for the Panthers. Murphy remembers helping her parents raise money for the upstart program when she was in middle school. "I always loved hockey and I always wanted to play in high school," she said.


  As team captain the past two years, she took her role seriously. "I just tried to influence the younger players," she said. "We had a large group of younger kids on our team, and with just a couple of seniors, it was very important to step up and show them what to do in the future."


  Murphy was also a league all-star midfielder on the Silver Lake lacrosse team last spring, and she will play both sports at Western New England University in Springfield. A National Honor Society student who plans on studying engineering, she is confident she'll be able to balance academics and athletics.


  "I talked to graduates from Western New England and they said that it's manageable at the Division 3 level," she said. "It's definitely going to be a lot of work, but I'm good at time management skills. I'm up for it."

Jesus said, “Remain in me.” The phrase can also be “abide in me.”


  Perhaps Jesus is even holding a branch in his hands at this point. Picture the place where the trunk of the vine meets the branch. This is the touch point between the two. This is the place of abiding. Here is the connection where the life giving nutrients in the sap can flow from the vine into the branch. The only limitation on the flow is the circumference of the branch. The branch with the largest, least obstructed connection with the vine is abiding the most and will bring forth the most fruit.


  Jesus said the key to a life of much fruit is this — abiding in and staying closely connected in relationship to Him. As we grow and bear fruit, God invites us to abide more deeply in Him that we might become even more fruitful. Jesus lets us know that the real key to bearing fruit for Him is found not in activity, but in walking in deeper relationship with Him.


  Abide means to stay closely connected, to dwell, or to settle in for the long term. Jesus is saying that an ongoing deep connection and union with him will ultimately determine the flow of his supernatural power and life into yours.

Menuda sorpresa se llevaron los agentes de la Policia Local cuando se trasladaron por la mañana a un bloque de viviendas situado en la calle Tarongers de la capital de la Plana donde, alertados por una vecina del edificio, encontraron una serpiente piton de tres metros que habia caido desde la ventana abierta de un quinto piso al patio de la finca. «Nunca habiamos recogido un animal de ese tamaño», reconocen a Mediterraneo.


  En un primer momento, tras comprobar que el descomunal reptil no sufria daños graves y que su actitud no era amenazante, requirieron la presencia de los bomberos, que trasladaron la piton a las dependencias policiales. Tras comprobar que no portaba chip, pudieron localizar al dueño, que prometio llevar su mascota al veterinario para comprobar su buen estado pese al porrazo, ademas de presentar parte de la documentacion, aunque a expensas de aportar una licencia de estar al cargo de una especie potencialmente peligrosa y, por el mismo motivo, un seguro de responsabilidad a terceros.

  Ademas, la Unidad de Proteccion Animal de la Policia Local de Castello, a raiz de las diligencias abiertas, verificara si el domicilio del propietario reune las condiciones para que una serpiente de tres metros pueda vivir alli, porque aunque la legislacion si permite la compraventa de este tipo de especimenes, no dice nada sobre las caracteristicas de su habitat entre los humanos como mascota.

PLYMOUTH - Coaches want someone like Alexis Muratore as part of their program. Not only has she proven herself to be a strong athlete and a great teammate, Muratore's also something of a good luck charm.


  In 11 athletic seasons with the Panthers golf, basketball and softball teams Muratore was a part of four different league title winners as well as a South Sectional championship. And she has enjoyed every single step of it along the way.


  "I've had so much fun playing high school sports. I loved every second of it," Muratore said. "It's not just about playing the games. The things I think I'm got to remember from the last four years are the times you spent with the team and all the things you did together as a group. That's what I think high school sports are really are about.


  "Sports have always been a special part of my everyday life," Muratore said. "I love keeping busy and I've made so many of my best friends because of all the sports that I've played."


  Muratore's dipped her toes into many different sports over the years. She played lacrosse and did gymnastics as youngster and she was also a pretty strong baseball player.


  "I played a lot of sports growing up but I actually never played youth softball. I always played with South Plymouth Youth Baseball while I was growing up and then I made the switch over to softball when I was a freshman at Plymouth South," she explained.


  The experience of playing on a team made up entirely of boys helped Muratore prepare for four years as a member of the South golf program.


  "I've played golf since I was around eight and it was great to have everyone just accept me as another member of the team despite the fact that they were all boys and I'm a girl," Muratore said. "Everyone treated me like I was another member of the team and were all great teammates to me."


  Muratore did her part to make things work, too. She played some varsity matches her junior year and by her senior season she had moved up to the fifth spot in the playing order.


  "She worked hard and became a good golfer. Alexis proved she belonged as a member of the team. She's a solid golfer and a competitive person who fit in well with the team," Plymouth South Golf Head Coach Tom Hicks said. "She was a pretty consistent hitter and I always knew she was going to come back with a pretty good score after her round of golf."


  Muratore averages a 42 for a nine-hole score. Standing at 5-foot-1 she's not really a big hitter off the tee but she tries to make up for it with a consistent short game. "I can hit the ball pretty straight and my short game is okay," she said.


  Each spring for the last four years Muratore's been a big part of the Plymouth South softball program that's worked its way into being one of the top squads in the region during that time. But switching from baseball to softball had a couple of obstacles that needed to be overcome.


  "I think we had to work on her swing a little bit as a freshman but she picked up on the changes right away. She was a two-year captain for me and super-coachable as a player. Always up-beat and positive," Panthers softball coach Stephanie Finn said. "The place where she's really excelled was defensively as the starting second baseman her sophomore and junior seasons. She's quick, really strong defensively and the competitive type of a player who would do everything she could to get to every ground ball that came her way."


  "I had so many great times with the softball team," Muratore said. "Hannah Masterson and I both came in as freshmen and the older players made us feel so accepted as teammates right away. We all got along as a group so well."


  A National Honor Society and Honor Roll student, Muratore was also a member of Student Council. She will attend the Isenberg School of Management at UMass Amherst.

“We understand that what happens five months before the election and what happens at the election can be very different things,” Whitmer said.


  Michigan was one of the Midwestern states that Trump carried by a razor-thin margin in 2016, helping him win the Electoral College even as he lost the popular vote. Other Democrats in the state say the strength of the president's support shouldn't be underestimated.


  “If the election were held today, I think Biden would win Michigan,” said Michigan Rep. Debbie Dingell. “But the Trump supporters are out there, and they’re still intense.”


  Obama underscored that point this week during his first joint fundraiser with Biden.


  “We can’t be complacent or smug or suggest that somehow it’s so obvious that this president hasn’t done a good job,” Obama told thousands of donors who gathered online. “He won once, and it’s not like we didn’t have a good clue as to how he was going to operate the last time.”


  Democrats have reason to be cautious. Four years ago, Hillary Clinton was leading by wide margins nationally and in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania -- the very states that ultimately put Trump over the top. But in the final weeks before the election, Republicans coalesced around their nominee, leading to his upset win.


  Trump is aiming for a repeat this year. He is stoking culture wars on health care and race relations. After warning that the 2016 election would be “rigged” against him, Trump said without evidence this week that the fall campaign would be the “most corrupt election ever.”


  Trump and many of his GOP allies, meanwhile, are working to squelch the expansion of absentee voting, which they worry would hand Democrats an advantage, despite no evidence supporting that.


  Many Republicans are quietly grim about the trends. But some are comforted by the same factors that give Democrats pause.


  “I’ve always thought it was going to be razor-thin in Wisconsin, and in turn, across the nation,” said former Gov. Scott Walker, who survived a bitter 2012 recall election and 2014 reelection before losing a third nail-biter in 2018.


  Trump’s fundraising and organizing still dwarfs those of Biden, who has named state-based staff in just three battlegrounds: Wisconsin, Arizona and North Carolina. When Biden announced his Wisconsin team Wednesday, Trump’s campaign retorted that its 2016 operation there never closed and already this year has trained 3,200 volunteers, held 750 “MAGA Meet-ups” and made 6 million voter contacts, which means their targets have been reached multiple times already.


  Still, the current dynamics don’t fit seamlessly with 2016.

Infrastructure term lender IFCI Ltd has reported widening of its consolidated net loss to Rs 584.19 crore for the quarter ended March 2020. The lender had posted a net loss of Rs 86.15 crore during the corresponding January-March period of 2018-19. Income during the quarter, however, rose to Rs 858.99 crore from Rs 637.61 crore on the back of healthy interest income, IFCI Ltd said in a regulatory filing on Friday. However, there was loss on account of fee and commission income, which was nearly at the same level of FY19. For the full fiscal 2019-20, the company narrowed its net loss to Rs 223.21 crore as against Rs 475.99 crore in FY19. Income during the year fell to Rs 2,905.68 crore from Rs 3,134.49 crore a year ago. IFCI further said the company board at its meeting held on Friday approved Resource Planning Policy for borrowing up to Rs 25,000 crore excluding temporary loans obtained from bankers in ordinary course of business at any point of time through loans bonds debentures. Also, during FY20, the company realised Rs 904.25 crore by sale of equity shares of National Stock Exchange of India Ltd NSE, which was valued at fair value as per Ind-AS norms in earlier financial statements. This resulted in a net loss of Rs 1.46 crore, which has been accounted for in the financial statements for the quarteryear ended March 31, 2020. On the COVID-19 outbreak, it said the impact will not be significant on its business and financial position.

The only show in the town of Adel Thursday night was the battle between the ADM High School and Woodward-Granger High School baseball teams.
   
 For the ADM fans, the Tigers did not disappoint as five second-inning runs helped propel the team to a 10-1 victory over a Hawks squad that gave up just 2.8 runs per game entering the contest. ADM tied their season-high in hits with eleven total and six of those eleven came within the first two innings of action. Following two singles to kick off the offensive action for the Tigers, ADM touched up the scoreboard first as Tate Stine-Smith drove in the first of three runs for the game as part of a big night for the junior. When all was said and done. Stine-Smith led ADM with three runs driven in, increasing his team-leading RBI total to eight on the season. It marked the seventh first- inning run that the Tigers have produced this season and it quickly gave ADM a 1-0 advantage.
   
 ADM really had two breakout innings which included the second inning where they posted five of their ten runs. It also marked the most runs given up in a single inning by Woodward-Granger this season. Overall, four Tigers drove in two runs for the contest, and that included Grant Garton. The junior followed up his game-winning hit on Tuesday with two hits and two RBI to wrap up the week Thursday. His first at-bat for the contest in the second inning produced his first RBI on a single to right field which in turn increased the ADM lead to a 2-0 mark. Stine-Smith also joined in on the second inning scoring action with a single to right field, scoring fellow junior Ethan Juergens from second base. Kaden Sutton's third double of the season, an Juergens RBI, and a Woodward-Granger error rounded out the second inning action for ADM, giving the Tigers a six-run lead after two innings.
   
 The rest of ADM's five hits would be spread out across the final five innings of play. The theme of scoring in bunches this season for ADM continued on yet again in the fifth inning Thursday night. With three runs in the inning, it marked the sixth such inning this season where ADM scored three or more runs in a single inning. Against the Hawks, that began with Zach Fuller's fourth double of the season to plate one run. Garton's second RBI of the game came in the inning and coupled with a score on a passed ball, that rounded out the scoring efforts on the night for the Tigers.
   
 "This group is very capable of scoring in bunches," said Tiger head coach Jason Book earlier this season. "It's not out of the question because once this team gets going, they are hard to stop."
   
 On the mound, ADM deployed Chase Anderson as the starting pitcher and he didn't disappoint. The senior tossed nearly six innings of work and suffered just four walks and four hits allowed. His seven strikeouts Thursday night now gives Anderson a Raccoon River Conference second-best mark of 17 total strikeouts on the season. Anderson also showed that his approach to the strike zone is hard for hitters to master as five out of his seven strikeouts came on swings and misses.
   
 The win gives ADM their sixth straight victory overall and fourth victory against a team holding a record above .500. The Tigers end their first of what looks to be several unblemished weeks of action in 2020. The next event on the docket for the Tigers will be perhaps their toughest test yet in the Winterset Huskies on Monday, June 29. The Tigers will once again be back home for that battle as they seek their 14th win over the Huskies since the 2009 campaign. The battle will begin with the first pitch at 7:30 p.m.

ACUSHNET -- Struggling to breathe, Patrick Liberty rolled down the car window, hoping his lungs would capture some of the cool spring air as his son hurriedly drove to waiting caretakers at St. Luke's Hospital.
 Only moments earlier, Liberty, who turns 69 next month, nearly fainted from acute shortness of breath at his Acushnet home.
 He came home from work between 4 and 5 p.m. on April 2, wasn't feeling well "at all" and doesn't remember eating, he said.
 Then it happened.
 "I started to fall at home. I couldn't catch my breath," he said, describing the scary moment. "I almost passed out." He would have hit the floor if his wife, Margaret, who was at his side, had not caught him.
 Liberty said he had pain in his lungs that would not quit. "It was so bad I couldn't breathe. It felt like someone's knee was pressing down on my lungs. It just wouldn't go away," he said.
 His family called ahead and emergency personnel were waiting for he and his son, Joshua, when they pulled up to the hospital's ER entrance around 5 p.m. They placed him on a stretcher and took him into the intensive care unit with a suspected case of COVID-19.
 Liberty would spend the next 25 days in the hospital, including a 15-day stretch where he was in a medically-induced coma, he said.
 A hard-working, self-employed plumber who has made his living with his hands for nearly 50 years, Liberty was ready to give up because the pain in his lungs was excruciating. He even told the emergency room personnel he wanted to die.
 "I was ready to give up. It hurt so much," said Liberty, who has also survived two bouts with cancer.
 But his daughter, Erica McGuire, acting like an angel on her father's shoulder, would have none of it. "Make sure he is going to live. He's a fighter. Don't listen to him," she said she told the doctors over the speakerphone of her father's cellphone.
 McGuire, who works at Southcoast Terminal Cancer Center, remembers that night clearly. She said her father is a strong man, but this was one time she had to be strong for him, while privately tearing up inside. "He never gives up. He's strong," she said, adding she and other family members cried every night for 3 1/2 weeks he was in the hospital.
 "She's my rock," Patrick Liberty said of his caring daughter who always seems to know what is best for him.
 The ER staff induced the coma and Liberty doesn't remember a thing until he came out of the coma on April 17, he said. "I was in La-La Land. I had crazy dreams about someone dying in my room. It was like an out-of-body experience," he said. "I didn't know what happened to me. People had to tell me when I woke up."
 Liberty was admitted on April 2 for acute respiratory disease due to the COVID-19 virus, according to Shawn Badgley, a spokesman at Southcoast Health. He was admitted to the ICU and intubated for the majority of his stay and was extubated on April 17. Liberty signed a media/HIPAA release, allowing his story as a COVID patient at Southcoast hospitals to be told. The Standard- Times, in turn, contacted Liberty.
 He is a regular guy and proud of his blue collar background. He owns Pat Liberty and Son Plumbing and does plumbing for new homes, commercial properties as well as gas piping. He is in business with his oldest son, Scott Liberty, a master plumber and a sergeant in the New Bedford Police Department.
 Pat Liberty is a working class hero -- a tough guy, with a good heart and a positive attitude, his family says. He's smart and knowledgeable about what he does. He likes to engage people and help them with their household problems.
 "The fact that someone is happy is all I need," he said of helping a customer with a plumbing problem.
 He's also a workaholic, loves getting up in the morning and going to job sites and has no plans to retire anytime soon. "I'll be working until the day I die. I love my job," he said.
 He stands 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 175 and maintains a somewhat healthy lifestyle that includes eating fish, pasta, sushi, scuba diving and running, he said. He also enjoys a few glasses of his favorite -- B and B Brandy -- on the deck of his home at night with family members and friends. "I do my best to be a healthy person," he said.
 He has had his share of medical issues the last few years, especially in 2017, he said. He had job-related shoulder surgery in early 2017, followed by hip replacement surgery in May of that same year.
 He had 47 radiation treatments for Level 3 prostate cancer that same year and he had two procedures to remove colon polyps. He had a second shoulder surgery in January 2018.
 When Liberty awoke from his coma on April 17, he was ready to get out of his hospital bed and get back to his life. "I didn't want to be there. I wanted to get home," he said. "I just didn't want to be there after the coma."
 But his lungs weren't strong enough and he was unsteady on his feet, he said. "Every time I tried to get out of bed the alarms went off," he said.
 Still he was determined to leave and his daughter had to intervene. "Dad, don't get out of bed. You might fall and break a hip and then you'll be there for another month," Erica said.
 He remained one more week in ICU before being transferred to a private room with another patient, he said. He had "to learn to walk again" with a walker and the aid of a therapist.
 While hospitalized, he grew a full beard, which he thought was strange considering he is bald. The hospital staff shaved it off. Always a jokester, he thought he was in the perfect place (a hospital) in case they accidentally cut him while shaving off his beard.
 A cardiologist checked him out and found he had a heart murmur, he said. "I've never had one. Never had one in my life," Liberty told the doctor.
 "Well, you have one now," the doctor told him, he said.
 A friend of his who was in the hospital at the same time died of COVID-19, he said. Liberty said it is sad thinking about his friend's death, saying he hugged the man's widow and offered her his condolences.
 Liberty was released from the hospital on April 27 and treated like a hero as he walked out the doors.
 The staff played Survivor's "Eye of the Tiger," from Rocky III and about 50 nurses and doctors lined the aisle, clapping in recognition of his victory over COVID-19, he said.
 "It was pretty cool. It was pretty emotional. I thought it would never end," he said in appreciation of their care. "It was pretty amazing."
 The outpouring of support by the staff cemented the bond he established with the staff. "I can't thank them enough for helping me. I can't give them enough accolades," he said.
 Liberty said he wants to go back to the hospital and meet all the nurses and doctors who cared for him. "They were all wearing masks," he said.
 Badgley said all of Liberty's acute problems "gradually resolved" and he was discharged on April 27 and has not been readmitted.
 Asked to comment on why he thinks he survived when so many, including his friend, have not, Liberty believes his healthy lifestyle paved the way to his recovery. "My strength got me through it," he said.
 After a 25-day hospitalization with the coronavirus, Liberty said he has heard people say the virus is "fake," which he said is just not true.
 "If they knew someone who had it, they would be afraid," he said.
