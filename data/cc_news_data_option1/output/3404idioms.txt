Enquanto na maior parte dos estados brasileiros houve melhora nos indices de mortalidade violenta juvenil, na faixa entre 15 e 29 anos, o Estado do Rio contabilizou aumento de 4,2% em 2018, segundo o Atlas da Violencia 2020, divulgado ontem. Em todo o pais, os jovens representaram 53,3% do total de homicidios naquele mesmo ano -- 30.873 vitimas. Conforme o estudo, feito pelo Instituto de Pesquisa Economica Aplicada (Ipea), em parceria com o Forum Brasileiro de Segurança Publica (FBSP), o homicidio foi a principal causa de mortes entre homens jovens.                 No total, 91,8% das vitimas foram homens, e o pico aos 21 anos. Entre homens e mulheres, a pesquisa verificou baixa escolaridade, com, no maximo, sete anos de estudo. O Atlas evidencia ainda a disparidade social no Brasil. Enquanto a taxa de homicidio de negros (soma de pretos e pardos, segundo classificaçao do IBGE) subiu 11,5% entre 2008 e 2018, entre nao negros (soma de brancos, amarelos e indigenas) reduziu 12,9%.                 No Brasil, 75,7% das vitimas assassinadas sao negras, mostrou a pesquisa. E para cada nao negro assassinado no pais em 2018, 2,7 negros foram mortos. Ao comparar as taxas entre negros e nao negros, a diretora-executiva do FBSP, Samira Bueno, adverte. "É como tivessemos falando de paises diferentes, porque tamanha a disparidade quando a gente olha para o fenomeno da violencia segmentando negros e nao negros", avalia.                     *[CET]: Central European Time

Advertising                     Kotnis’ medical assistance during the difficult days of the Chinese revolution was praised by Chinese leader Mao Zedong. His statues and memorials were also set in some of the Chinese cities in recognition of his services.                     He is married to Chinese national Guo Qinglan, who died in 2012.                     Apart from the school named after him as the Shijiazhuang Ke Dihua Medical Science Secondary Specialised School, there are memorials of Kotnis in both Shijiazhuang, the capital of Hebei province, and Tangxian county where he once worked.                     Late Chinese leader Mao Zedong was deeply affected by his death, the report said.                     Mao wrote in his eulogy that “the army has lost a helping hand, the nation has lost a friend. Let us always bear in mind his internationalist spirit”.                     According to Liu Wenzhu, an official of the Shijiazhuang Ke Dihua Medical Science Secondary Specialised School, since the founding of the school in 1992 more than 45,000 medical professionals have graduated from it.                     Each of the new students and staff must swear in front of a stone statue of Kotnis that they would work like him, he said.                     Liu hopes that Kotnis will be remembered not only as a symbol inspiring medical students to work hard, but also an eternal bond between the people of China and India.                     “We are the world’s two most populous countries ...

The Ajaokuta Steel Company Limited was started in 1979, and envisaged to launch Nigeria into the steel development realm in a few years. But 41 years later, it remains mere dream, with billions of dollars gone down the drain. The steel mill became a cesspool of corruption for many decades. Each government came, made false promises, pumped dollars and more dollars into the sinking hole, officials pocketed the rest, yet the steel mill, built on 24,000 hectares of land remains uncompleted. The Buhari administration took up the gauntlet. Last year, the President held talks with the original builders of the mill in Russia, and the project is set to roar to life before 2023. And Buhari’s name would remain indelible in the annals of the country, without the man setting out to achieve anything personal.                     *[CET]: Central European Time

In the immediate aftermath of the violence, countless researchers, NGOs, international bodies and governments condemned Myanmar for its treatment of the Rohingya, with some deeming the coordinated attacks on the Muslim minority ‘a textbook example of ethnic cleansing’.
 A year later in August 2018, in a scathing 444-page report based on 875 in- depth interviews with victims and witnesses, satellite imagery and authenticated documents, the United Nations investigators exposed the unilateral and deliberate nature of the violence for everyone to see and called for Myanmar military leaders to be prosecuted for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.
 Despite all this, today, on the third anniversary of ‘the Rohingya genocide’, the survivors of Myanmar’s ethnic cleansing campaign are still waiting for justice. Not only Myanmar’s military and political leaders have not been held to account for their murderous actions, but almost nothing has been done to ease the suffering of hundreds of thousands of Rohingya living in limbo in Bangladeshi refugee camps.
 Today, the conversations surrounding the fate of the Rohingya are curiously focused not on Myanmar, but Bangladesh. The international community, seemingly convinced that Myanmar cannot be forced to change its ways and accept the Rohingya, are putting pressure on Bangladesh to ameliorate the living conditions of the refugees it hosts and counter the growing intolerance against them in the country.
 It is undeniable that the relations between the locals and the Rohingya refugees are rapidly deteriorating in Bangladesh. Nevertheless, it is hypocritical to expect a developing nation that has been hosting hundreds of thousands of refugees with little help from the international community for many decades to continue to do so with enthusiasm for the foreseeable future.
 The first group of Rohingya refugees arrived in Bangladesh back in 1978, after the government of Myanmar branded them ‘illegal immigrants’ and launched ‘Operation Dragon King’ to push them out. As more than 200,000 Rohingya entered Bangladesh with little more than the clothes on their backs, Bangladeshi communities living near the border welcomed them with open arms.
 In 1991-92, the Myanmar military launched another operation, named ‘Operation Clean and Beautiful Nation’, to expel so-called ‘foreigners’. This second episode of state-sponsored violence pushed a further 200,000 Rohingya into Bangladesh. This time they were not received as warmly, as the increasing number of refugees exacerbated the economic struggles of the local population. Nevertheless, Bangladeshis still saw it as their duty to help their neighbours, and the refugees settled in the country without much pushback from the host community.
 When a further 700,000 Rohingya arrived in Bangladesh in 2017, however, the hospitality of Bangladeshis seemingly reached its limits. As 34 temporary refugee camps were built to house the newly arrived refugees, the local population started to complain about the unprecedented strain this massive influx has put on the local economy and infrastructure. Claiming that the refugee influx has led to labour insecurity, food inflation, water shortage, environmental damage and also more crimes, they started demanding the Rohingya to swiftly return to their own country.
 Since the influx in 2017, several attempts have been made to repatriate the Rohingya refugees to Myanmar. In November 2017, Bangladesh and Myanmar signed an ‘arrangement’ on ‘Return of displaced Myanmar persons sheltered in Bangladesh’. There have been two consequent attempts to repatriate the refugees (in November 2018 and August 2019), but both attempts proved unsuccessful as the Rohingya refugees refused to move, citing security concerns.
 Indeed, since the episode of violence in 2017, Myanmar authorities did nothing to ensure the safe return of the refugees. The state not only failed to accept responsibility for the atrocities and punish the perpetrators, but also refused to give citizenship rights to the returning Rohingya. Moreover, the conditions that led the Rohingya to flee their homeland did not change in the last three years.
 The Myanmar military not only continued to commit atrocities against the few remaining Rohingya, but also launched a new operation in Rakhine state against the Rakhine Buddhists, flaming further instability in the region. The Buddhist citizens of Myanmar, meanwhile, repeatedly made it clear that they do not want the Rohingya, who they view as ‘terrorists’, to return.
 All this has left the Rohingya refugees stuck in a foreign country they are no longer welcome. The Bangladeshi authorities, meanwhile, are caught between a rock and a hard place, as they cannot force the Rohingya refugees to return to Myanmar to face more violence, but also cannot afford to create the necessary conditions for them to live in harmony with the local population.
 In the last three years, just a handful of nations and international organisations took steps to help resolve the Rohingya crisis beyond issuing empty statements of concern or sending aid to the refugees in Bangladesh. The Gambia, for example, filed a case against Myanmar at the International Court of Justice to bring the perpetrators of the 2017 violence to justice. The ongoing case helped carry the issue to global headlines once again, however, it made little difference on the ground.
 Today, as we commemorate the third ‘Rohingya Genocide Memorial Day’, we need to understand that the Rohingya problem cannot be resolved merely by sending aid to Bangladesh and pressuring it to do more to help the refugees it hosts. Aid can give the refugees temporary relief, but it cannot help them build their lives back. It cannot fulfil their yearning for their homeland either.
 The international community needs to stop focusing on temporary fixes and start looking for a way to help the Rohingya refugees return home to Myanmar safely. If it fails to do so, there will be no end to the suffering of the Rohingya.

Pyramid Hill Sculpture Park and Museum in Hamilton, Ohio, is all that and more. It is a park filled with art and can be seen in a variety of ways. It is a safe-distancing outdoor adventure suitable for the entire family.                The best way to see the unique 300-plus-acre sculpture park is by golf cart, or "art cart," as those at the park refer to it.                Many opportunities await visitors to park their cart and take a hike. With miles of hiking trails, lakes, meadows and forests, there is a lot to explore. It is a place to take a picnic, let the kids run and give them a little art education as well. Among the rolling hills and in the museum, visitors will find ancient Greek, Roman, Etruscan, Syrian and Egyptian sculptures that date back to 1550 B.C., as well as many modern art pieces.                 The park was a vision of local attorney and philanthropist Harry Wilks, who in 1987 purchased 40 acres in the foothills to build his home. He continued to acquire more land as time went on and began clearing it, building roads, lakes and hiking trails. Because of his desire to preserve the land for future generations, he created a non-profit sculpture park accessible to the public.                 In 2007 the Ancient Sculpture Museum opened, and it holds models of ancient Roman homes and Wilks' collection of ancient sculptures.                 While cruising the grounds visitors will find gardens and more than 80 outdoor sculptures. The pioneer house that dates back to the 1820s has an arched ceiling, which was very unusual at the time.                 Pets are welcome, as long as they are on a leash. Watch out for the wild turkeys and other wildlife often visible in the park.                 The Pyramid House on the property was Wilks' home. It is an underground home designed by Wilks and architect Luke Schelly. It is a one-of-a-kind home and today is used for private parties and meetings. The home has been featured in Better Homes & Gardens, Architectural Digest and other magazines and newspapers. The patios offer great views of the park.                 The sculptures can be enjoyed by cart, on foot or by car. Visitors can take as much time at the sculptures as they wish. Pack a picnic, bring a snack, or stop by one of Hamilton's restaurants and pick up some food to go.                 During the holiday season, the park hosts the Holiday Lights on the Hill drive-through light display.                 Check pyramidhill.org for current information on hours and programs. Pyramid Hill, about 30 miles north of Cincinnati, is open 365 days a year as weather permits.

The number of patients being tested positive for coronavirus illness has been on significant decline particularly in Rawalpindi district as a total of 102 new patients have been tested positive for the disease from the district in the last four weeks yet the threat of the spread of another deadly infection, dengue fever seems to be on the cards.            The first four confirmed cases of dengue fever in 2020 have already been reported from the district that may set a stage for a possible outbreak of dengue fever in this region of the country bringing into existence one of the most important risk factor for the appearance of seasonal dengue fever, the infected traveller or native. The positive cases of the infection from a region prove the existence of adult mosquito ‘aedes aegypti’, the vector that causes dengue fever.            Studies reveal that the confirmation of infection in a traveller or native increases the chance of spread of dengue fever in a region as the female dengue fever mosquitoes, ‘Aedes Aegypti’ or ‘Aedes Albopictus’, carry one of the four types of dengue viruses from the dengue patient to the healthy person and transmit the disease.            It is worth mentioning here that the population in the district faced the worst ever dengue fever outbreak last year, in 2019 when the three teaching hospitals in town tested over 12,000 patients positive for dengue fever setting a new record as the number of confirmed cases reported in one year alone, in 2019 at allied hospitals was equal to the number of patients confirmed positive in the previous 13 years, from 2006 to 2018. Also the number of deaths caused by the infection in 2019 crossed the total number of deaths due to dengue fever reported in the previous 13 years at the allied hospitals.            According to experts, the only best method to reduce the transmission of the dengue virus is to control vector mosquitoes and avoid mosquito bites.            Data collected by ‘The News’ on Thursday reveals that 16 more patients have been tested positive for COVID-19 from ICT in the last 24 hours whereas from Rawalpindi, only six new cases of the illness have been reported.            From Rawalpindi district, as many as 6019 patients have so far been confirmed positive for COVID-19 of which 5653 have already recovered while 280 have lost their lives. On Thursday, there were less than 85 active cases of the disease in Rawalpindi.                                                     *[CET]: Central European Time

Amy Perrett made history Friday by becoming the first woman to referee a men's Super Rugby game, a move she hopes will open the door to other females.
 The Australian took charge of the clash between the ACT Brumbies and Western Force in Canberra after reguarly running the sidelines in other Super Rugby AU matches this season.
 "I've been really fortunate to already achieve a lot, so everything now is all a bit of a bonus, and it's just a case of taking any opportunity as it arises," she told rugby.com.au ahead of the game.
 Perrett was already the first woman official in Super Rugby, having been appointed assistant referee for a showdown between the Melbourne Rebels and Western Stormers in 2016.
 She officiated the 2014 women's World Cup final and is a regular at the women's Six Nations, but is not the first female to control a men's professional game.
 That honour went to Ireland's Joy Neville, who took charge of a Challenge Cup pool game between France's Bordeaux-Begles and Russian club Enisei in 2017.
 Perrett, a mother, said she hoped her achievements would spur on other women to greater sporting achievements.
 "It's an old cliche, but if you can't see it, you can't be it," she said.
 "However, I do hope now that I've done it, anyone else can."

            Pyramid Hill Sculpture Park and Museum in Hamilton, Ohio, is all that and more. It is a park filled with art and can be seen in a variety of ways. It is a safe-distancing outdoor adventure suitable for the entire family.            The best way to see the unique 300-plus-acre sculpture park is by golf cart, or \"art cart,\" as those at the park refer to it.            Many opportunities await visitors to park their cart and take a hike. With miles of hiking trails, lakes, meadows and forests, there is a lot to explore. It is a place to take a picnic, let the kids run and give them a little art education as well. Among the rolling hills and in the museum, visitors will find ancient Greek, Roman, Etruscan, Syrian and Egyptian sculptures that date back to 1550 B.C., as well as many modern art pieces.             The park was a vision of local attorney and philanthropist Harry Wilks, who in 1987 purchased 40 acres in the foothills to build his home. He continued to acquire more land as time went on and began clearing it, building roads, lakes and hiking trails. Because of his desire to preserve the land for future generations, he created a non-profit sculpture park accessible to the public.             In 2007 the Ancient Sculpture Museum opened, and it holds models of ancient Roman homes and Wilks' collection of ancient sculptures.             While cruising the grounds visitors will find gardens and more than 80 outdoor sculptures. The pioneer house that dates back to the 1820s has an arched ceiling, which was very unusual at the time.             Pets are welcome, as long as they are on a leash. Watch out for the wild turkeys and other wildlife often visible in the park.             The Pyramid House on the property was Wilks' home. It is an underground home designed by Wilks and architect Luke Schelly. It is a one-of-a-kind home and today is used for private parties and meetings. The home has been featured in Better Homes & Gardens, Architectural Digest and other magazines and newspapers. The patios offer great views of the park.             The sculptures can be enjoyed by cart, on foot or by car. Visitors can take as much time at the sculptures as they wish. Pack a picnic, bring a snack, or stop by one of Hamilton's restaurants and pick up some food to go.             During the holiday season, the park hosts the Holiday Lights on the Hill drive-through light display.             Check pyramidhill.org for current information on hours and programs. Pyramid Hill, about 30 miles north of Cincinnati, is open 365 days a year as weather permits.             Contact CR Rae at crraetravel@gmail.com.            "         *[CET]: Central European Time

The peace agreement signed between the US and the Taliban on February 29 clearly mentioned that the Taliban and the Afghan government would swap prisoners to pave the way for intra-Afghan dialogue envisaged to start on March 10. But surprisingly Afghan President Ashraf Ghani refused to release the Taliban prisoners and said that the issue could be discussed during the intra-Afghan dialogue. He even asked the Taliban to tell him when they would sever ties with Pakistan, notwithstanding the fact that it was due to the efforts of Pakistan that the Taliban had agreed to engage in dialogue with the US and also talking to the Afghan government with whom they have been refusing any engagement.
 The reluctance on the part of the Afghan president created a situation which could have scuttled the agreement between the Taliban and the US, leading to a relapse of the country into conflict and instability. However, the US, Pakistan and other regional powers who have a stake in peace in Afghanistan continued their efforts to make sure that the peace process was not derailed.
 The US particularly employed pressure on the Afghan government to abide by the peace agreement. These efforts finally produced the desired result when on the weekend, the Afghan grand assembly of elders approved the release of the 400 Taliban prisoners accused of "major" crimes which the authorities had initially refused to set free. They included some 44 insurgents who were of particular concern to the United States and other countries for their roles in high-profile attacks.
 Among the regional countries, Pakistan undoubtedly has the highest stake in peace in Afghanistan. Pakistan’s support to an Afghan-led and Afghan-owned solution of the conflict in Afghanistan is dictated by the country’s own strategic, security and economic interests as well as its innate desire of peaceful co-existence with its neighbours. That is why it has been making relentless efforts for the dialogue between the US and Taliban, eventually paving the way for the much needed intra-Afghan negotiations.
 Now that the obstacles to intra-Afghan dialogue have been removed and both sides are poised for first ever engagement with each to resolve the issue, Pakistan invited the Afghan Taliban to Pakistan for an exchange of views on the current status of Afghan Peace process and the way forward.
 Pakistan has also held meetings with the Afghan Taliban in October 2019 at the Foreign Office and in Doha in February this year. The purpose ostensibly is to make sure that the Taliban show flexibility in their stance to level the ground for finding an amicable solution to the conflict in Afghanistan and impressing upon them the desirability of success of the process.
 The ensuing intra-Afghan dialogue probably would be the most arduous undertaking to find permanent peace in that country and build a consensus on the future political structure. It will require extreme caution, flexibility from both sides and unswerving commitment.
 Reportedly, Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi in a meeting with the delegation of the Taliban on Tuesday cautioned them of the ‘spoilers’ who do not want to see the return of peace in the region. He was right on the money in pointing it out to the Taliban. Surely there are some elements within Afghanistan as well in the region, which would like to sabotage the peace process.
 This is a now or never opportunity both for the Taliban and the Afghan government to end the conflict and give peace to their people which they deserve. Few would tend to differ with Qureshi’s reiteration that all the Afghan stakeholders must seize this historic opportunity to secure an inclusive, broad-based and comprehensive negotiated political solution. He rightly emphasized that there is no military solution to the conflict in Afghanistan and that political settlement was the only way forward.
 While calling for the implementation of the peace agreement, he also re- affirmed that Pakistan would continue to support an Afghan-led and Afghan- owned peace process for durable peace, stability and prosperity in the region and beyond. Pakistan and Afghanistan have historic, cultural and religious affinities.
 It is encouraging to note that the Taliban delegation affirmed support for efforts for peace, security and development in Afghanistan and also thanked the Pakistan government for its consistent support to the people of Afghanistan, including for graciously hosting Afghan refugees.
 It is pertinent to mention that Pakistan has not only been in contact with the Afghan Taliban but also with the Afghan government to iron out mutual differences and urge upon it the desirability of peace in the interest of Afghanistan and the whole region.
 The Afghan government must act wisely in the greater interest of peace and tranquility in the country. As they say there is many a slip betwixt the cup and the lip, it would not be an easy undertaking to agree on the future political arrangement in Afghanistan due to the existence of conflicting interests within the country as well the regional environment. It is really going to test the political acumen, foresight and unwavering commitment on both sides to achieve the desired objective.
 Afghanistan faces an uphill task in not only returning to peace but also to rebuild the destroyed infrastructure and economy. The redeeming factor is that regional powers including Pakistan and China are also committed to help Afghanistan in the rebuilding phase– provided the Afghans are able to end the conflict in the country and pull it out of the quagmire that it is stuck at the moment.

A former Defiance High School runner will now take the reins of the Bulldog cross country program this season with 2001 DHS grad Jennifer Stinnett leading the charge following Scott Saner's 17-season tenure as DHS mentor.


  The Bulldogs do lose their top two runners from last season in Shay Soukup (eighth at WBL championships, third at districts, state qualifier) and Abby Horvath (regional qualifier, sixth at WBL championships and Division II districts) but a talented core remains.


  With the preseason affected by a lack of stability due to the coronavirus, a full opportunity to get acquainted with the runners and the program wasn't available for Stinnett but the wheels are turning and optimism is abound.


  "I feel like it seemed at the time that it was a disruption," said Stinnett of the uncertainty regarding contact or non-contact status from the Ohio Department of Health and the OHSAA ahead of an early-August decision for the latter. "But the girls kept running on their own and I had a lot of confidence in them to take the initiative. I wanted to accommodate for the stress factor of it too, I didn't want the girls to be overwhelmed with all that stress on top of the running.


  "They all really pushed forward, though, and they were rearing to go when we resumed practice."


  One runner that has made an early impression is sophomore Mira Horvath. The DHS youngster finished in the top-25 at the Division II regionals last season and has been named a team captain to start this year.


  Juniors Emily Wahl, Kameron Burkhart and Olivia Moats also will don Bulldog Blue in 2020, joined by senior Joanna Schlatter and sophomore Sunny Lloyd as runners with postseason reps from last season.


  Gauging the Bulldogs' talent and competitive spirit has been the one task that Stinnett is looking to complete as the annual Defiance Early Bird Invitational will provide an early test and a barometer for the Bulldogs to start the fall season.


  "That really is the key thing here, we haven't really had the competition," said Stinnett. "We've had time trials but that only tells you so much. Competition and races are way different and that's what sets things apart in terms of who fights through, how people handle those events. The girls all seem really positive and that's what I'm encouraging and hoping."


  The Early Bird Invitational, featuring a bevy of teams from across the area scene, will set some squads apart. The Bulldogs will compete in the opening race of the day at 9 a.m. on Saturday, joined by Archbold, Bryan, Delta, Liberty-Benton, Napoleon, Paulding, Perrysburg, Toledo St. Ursula, Sylvania Southview and Wauseon.


  "The girls are really looking forward to getting the season started," noted Stinnett. "They've been extremely motivated this week. It's been so hot, school's started so that's a whole other stress and they've showed up and worked as hard as ever. I've got no doubt on Saturday they're going to do very well, at least on a personal level. We'll see how it goes on the competitive side but I'm just excited to have this season started."

“There have been a few wrinkles, but we do know that the books made it to Ariel, and we’re still working out the details at Reavis and Kozminski,” said Gruber.             The meeting also included a presentation from Caroline Bilicki, a representative from the nonprofit advocacy group Illinois Families for Public Schools, on the graduated income tax amendment on the ballot this November. The amendment, which requires 60% approval to pass, would raise taxes on those earning more than $250,000.             At the meeting, Bilicki tied the proposal to inequities in school funding, noting that Illinois ranks below the national average in terms of how much funding for a given school district comes from the state. Instead, the majority of funding for each district comes from local sources, predominantly property tax revenue.             “Why this is the problem is that the poorest communities have the least ability to raise revenue to cover costs for the students with the greatest needs, and communities with greater resources are able to spend more per student,” said Bilicki.                      *[CET]: Central European Time

Plunged in this fire were demons and souls in human form, like transparent burning embers, all blackened or burnished bronze, floating about in the conflagration, now raised into the air by the flames that issued from within themselves together with great clouds of smoke, now falling back on every side like sparks in a huge fire, without weight or equilibrium, and amid shrieks and groans of pain and despair, which horrified us and made us tremble with fear. The demons could be distinguished by their terrifying and repulsive likeness to frightful and unknown animals, all black and transparent. This vision lasted but an instant._

The RSPCA said animal welfare officer Steve Donohue was dispatched to the scene when a heifer was reported to have plunged into a tributary of the River Exe in Exeter.
 "The heifer had fallen into the river and been washed downstream along the River Exe tributary," Donohue said. "Debris from the storm had pinned her against the bank so she was struggling to get out and couldn't keep her head above the 6-foot-deep water."
 Donohue arrived at the scene and summoned the local fire and rescue service, which sent a crew to the scene. The crew sent for a specialist water and animal rescued team.
 "I got into the water in my drysuit and managed to get a line around her. Then we performed a front assist rescue by pulling her free and up the bank," Donohue said.
 He said it took the team of 12 rescuers about two hours to get the Friesan heifer back to dry land.
 "She was absolutely exhausted but, thankfully, wasn't injured. We took the fence down and got her back into her field before building the fence again and contacting the farmer to let him know what had happened," the rescuer said.

  Pyramid Hill Sculpture Park and Museum in Hamilton, Ohio, is all that and more. It is a park filled with art and can be seen in a variety of ways. It is a safe-distancing outdoor adventure suitable for the entire family.


  The best way to see the unique 300-plus-acre sculpture park is by golf cart, or \"art cart,\" as those at the park refer to it.


  Many opportunities await visitors to park their cart and take a hike. With miles of hiking trails, lakes, meadows and forests, there is a lot to explore. It is a place to take a picnic, let the kids run and give them a little art education as well. Among the rolling hills and in the museum, visitors will find ancient Greek, Roman, Etruscan, Syrian and Egyptian sculptures that date back to 1550 B.C., as well as many modern art pieces.


  The park was a vision of local attorney and philanthropist Harry Wilks, who in 1987 purchased 40 acres in the foothills to build his home. He continued to acquire more land as time went on and began clearing it, building roads, lakes and hiking trails. Because of his desire to preserve the land for future generations, he created a non-profit sculpture park accessible to the public.


  In 2007 the Ancient Sculpture Museum opened, and it holds models of ancient Roman homes and Wilks' collection of ancient sculptures.


  While cruising the grounds visitors will find gardens and more than 80 outdoor sculptures. The pioneer house that dates back to the 1820s has an arched ceiling, which was very unusual at the time.


  Pets are welcome, as long as they are on a leash. Watch out for the wild turkeys and other wildlife often visible in the park.


  The Pyramid House on the property was Wilks' home. It is an underground home designed by Wilks and architect Luke Schelly. It is a one-of-a-kind home and today is used for private parties and meetings. The home has been featured in Better Homes & Gardens, Architectural Digest and other magazines and newspapers. The patios offer great views of the park.


  The sculptures can be enjoyed by cart, on foot or by car. Visitors can take as much time at the sculptures as they wish. Pack a picnic, bring a snack, or stop by one of Hamilton's restaurants and pick up some food to go.


  During the holiday season, the park hosts the Holiday Lights on the Hill drive-through light display.


  Check pyramidhill.org for current information on hours and programs. Pyramid Hill, about 30 miles north of Cincinnati, is open 365 days a year as weather permits.

At this stage in the pandemic, she said health officials are relying less on individual models and more on actual disease data in combination with a full body of evidence covering what's known about the disease, the novel coronavirus and school openings around the world.
 "School settings are not expected to be major drivers of community transmission," she said.
 Dan Coombs, a mathematician at the University of British Columbia, said his own kids are set to return to high school in the fall.
 "It's sobering when you look at numbers like that," he said in reference to the SFU figures.
 Overall, he said school transmission should reflect wider transmission within the community, so COVID-19 cases in schools should vary across the province.
 There's no "magic number" that would indicate schools should be closed, he said, but school districts should prepare plans for when that might happen.
 At this stage, the evidence suggests children are less likely to develop severe symptoms from COVID-19 but the harmful effects of closing schools is well known, he said.
 "I think it's very important that we do reopen schools and we do what we can to make that happen and make it happen as safely as possible."
 Fleming said Wednesday there are guidelines for what happens if and when a case should present itself at schools, including what to do and when it warrants a public health investigation.
 Broadly speaking, the ministry has asked school districts to prepare to move to fully remote or hybrid models of learning if there is a significant second wave.
 "We'll be able to move forward as well as we can move back," Fleming said, depending on public health orders.
 In an article titled "Ethics of COVID-19-related school closures" published in the Canadian Journal of Public Health on Aug. 7, Michael Silverman, Robert Sibbald and Saverio Stranges argue for a regular re-evaluation of the need to open or close schools as new data emerges.
 They call for at least a partial reopening because of the apparent low risk of the virus to children and negative consequences of a closure.
 There's very limited evidence that school closures have any impact on coronavirus outbreaks, they write.
 Silverman is with the division of infectious diseases at Western University in London, Ont., Stranges is a professor at Western's department of epidemiology and biostatistics, and Sibbald is with the London Health Sciences Centre.
 Modelling studies suggest school closures have the greatest effect if the virus has low transmissibility and if attack rates are higher in children than adults, neither of which they say are likely true for COVID-19. Although high school students may have higher rates of infection, preschool and elementary students have an especially low infection risk and do particularly poorly with distance learning, the article says.
 "Reopening schools for these younger children is an urgent priority," it says.
 Children kept at home have higher rates of anxiety and depression, more screen time and are at greater risk of physical abuse. For vulnerable families, the loss of access to school services like counselling, special education and nutritional support is concerning. And the economic effects of parents being kept home to provide childcare are particularly severe for disadvantaged families, the article says.
 "Although the long-term effects of our current COVID-19-related schooling policy are largely unknown, it is safe to say that there are likely to be several unintended consequences which we will recognize only after the data are compiled."
 This report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 28, 2020.

Ulcerative colitis causes inflammation and sometimes polyps in the bowels. People with the condition can have a normal life expectancy but serious cases can involve life-threatening complications.
 After his recent hospital visits were reported, top officials from Abe’s Cabinet and the ruling party said he was overworked and badly needed rest.
 His health concerns came as his support ratings plunged due to his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and its severe impact on the economy, on top of a stream of political scandals.
 There are a slew of politicians eager to replace Abe.
 Shigeru Ishiba, a 63-year-old hawkish former defence minister and Abe’s archrival, is a favourite next leader in media surveys, though he is less popular within the governing party. A low-key former foreign minister, Fumio Kishida, Defence Minister Taro Kono, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, and economic revitalization minister Yasutoshi Nishimura, who is in charge of coronavirus measures, are widely mentioned in Japanese media as potential successors.
 Abe was often upstaged in dealing with the coronavirus pandemic by Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike, a former governing party conservative who is seen as a potential prime minister candidate by some. But she would have to first be elected to parliament to be in the running for the top job.
 The end of Abe's scandal-laden first stint as prime minister was the beginning of six years of annual leadership change, remembered as an era of “revolving door” politics that lacked stability and long-term policies.
 When he returned to office in 2012, Abe vowed to revitalize the nation and get its economy out of its deflationary doldrums with his “Abenomics” formula, which combines fiscal stimulus, monetary easing and structural reforms.
 Perhaps Abe’s biggest failure was his inability to fulfil a long-cherished goal of his grandfather to formally rewrite the U.S.-drafted pacifist constitution. Abe and his ultra-conservative supporters see the U.S.-drafted constitution as a humiliating legacy of Japan’s World War II defeat.
 He was also unable to achieve his goal of settling several unfinished wartime legacies, including normalizing ties with North Korea, settling island disputes with neighbours and signing a peace treaty with Russia formally ending their hostilities in World War II.

"The state is ready to proceed to a trial in the event the defendant wants it," Noll said. Asked whether Buckner could plead guilty to a lesser charge as part of a plea deal, Noll said anything is possible and that his office can amend charges at any time, though he said they have not done so at this point.            Buckner faces one charge of driving under the influence of alcohol, a Class A misdemeanor. Should Buckner continue to plead not guilty, a trial would be held, likely beginning on Oct. 20. Penalties for Class A misdemeanors range from a fine and court supervision to 364 days in jail and a $2,500 fine.            Police arrested Buckner after they found him asleep at the wheel of his vehicle in the state capital during his freshman legislative session, saying his breath smelled like alcohol. He failed field sobriety tests and refused a blood alcohol test at the scene. The case has bounced from one pretrial date to the next since then.

Watch out for the wild turkeys and other wildlife often visible in the park.      The Pyramid House on the property was Wilks' home. It is an underground home designed by Wilks and architect Luke Schelly. It is a one-of-a-kind home and today is used for private parties and meetings. The home has been featured in Better Homes & Gardens, Architectural Digest and other magazines and newspapers. The patios offer great views of the park.      The sculptures can be enjoyed by cart, on foot or by car. Visitors can take as much time at the sculptures as they wish. Pack a picnic, bring a snack, or stop by one of Hamilton's restaurants and pick up some food to go.      During the holiday season, the park hosts the Holiday Lights on the Hill drive-through light display.      Check pyramidhill.org for current information on hours and programs. Pyramid Hill, about 30 miles north of Cincinnati, is open 365 days a year as weather permits.      Contact CR Rae at crraetravel@gmail.com.
