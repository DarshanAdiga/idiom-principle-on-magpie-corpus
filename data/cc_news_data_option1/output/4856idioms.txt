Holiday safety is becoming a big issue now, especially during the on-going COVID-19 pandemic and for those who are the most vulnerable. Between November and mid-January are when many families gather together and travel spikes across the nation. However, this year could be different, as many families take extra precautions, especially when visiting elderly loved ones. Whether you are traveling or not, there are some basic precautions to ensure your family remains safe throughout the season.


  The Transportation Security Administration recently reported the highest number of people traveling through checkpoints in a single day since the COVID-19 pandemic brought the country to a halt. During the second to last Sunday of November, over one million people were screened by the TSA. This year, families must toe the line of mitigating their own risk and adhering to local and state directives.


  The Centers for Disease Control outlines some travel recommendations to consider this holiday season. The CDC notes that travel may increase your chance of getting and spreading COVID-19 and they recommend postponing travel and staying home is the best option to protect yourself and others.


  However, seeing family and friends this holiday season may look different for some seniors, whether you are living in the same state or a different one. You may have to consider virtual celebrations or family gatherings outdoors and arranging visits that keeps everyone safe.


  Although, if you are unsure, there are some questions you can ask per the CDC:


  Is anyone in your household or someone you visit at an increased risk of getting extremely sick from COVID-19?


  What are the case numbers within the community or your final destination?


  Are the hospitals in your community or destination overwhelmed?


  What are the local restrictions within your state or the county or state you are visiting?


  Nothing about 2020 has been ideal for anyone, and the entire year has caused significant issues for individuals, families, and businesses. However, the risk for seniors, especially those with underlying health conditions, is high.


  According to Excellent Care, Decency, and Optimal Living, the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the senior population. If you are living in a retirement community or assisted living, there could be some restrictions and or health guidelines for family visiting. Despite everything that is going on, it is important to stay connected with your family over the holiday season.


  If you do travel, check the travel restrictions, get your flu shot, wear a mask when you cannot socially distance and socially distance when you can. Continue to maintain good hygiene with hand washing and hand sanitizer. Avoid touching your mask, eyes, nose, and mouth, and make responsible decisions if you have to delay your travel.


  Whichever decision you end up making, take steps to stay safe, maintain the spirit of the holidays, and keep connected with your family. Whether this is virtually or in-person, everyone should be involved with the planning. Voice your concerns and ideas about celebrating and making time for each other over this holiday season. Social distancing should not mean social isolation.

Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve staff exhibited less concern this month about the risks that rising asset prices pose to financial stability, even as the stock market continued to gain ground.
 At the Federal Open Market Committee’s Nov. 4-5 meeting, staff judged that asset valuations appeared “moderate,” after accounting for the low level of interest rates, according to minutes of the gathering released on Wednesday.
 That was a change in wording from their last published appraisal in July, when they characterized asset valuation pressures as “notable.” The different description came despite a roughly 7% rise in the S&P 500 stock market index and a 20 basis-point increase in the yield on 10-year U.S. government notes between the two meetings. Stock prices have risen even further since then, reaching record levels this week.
 The Fed’s assessment of financial stability risks can play a role in determining the stance of monetary policy. Some policy makers might be reluctant to provide more stimulus to the flagging economy through bond purchases if they thought it would lead to price bubbles and extreme leverage that could hurt output even more in the future.
 In an attempt to combat the damage to the economy from the pandemic, the Fed has cut short-term interest rates effectively to zero and brought trillions of dollars of bonds -- an ultra-loose monetary stance that some investors identify as a key reason behind the stock market’s meteoric rise since March.
 At this month’s meeting, Fed policy makers discussed providing more guidance on their bond-buying strategy “fairly soon,” though they didn’t see a need for immediate adjustments.
 Events since the gathering have continued to keep the case for action in the spotlight, even if officials have declined to clearly signal it is in the cards next month. The economy is enduring surging Covid-19 infection rates and the Trump administration last week declined to extend several Fed emergency lending facilities that the central bank publicly lobbied to keep on the books.
 Fed Chairman Jerome Powell in the past has flagged the dangers that excessively elevated asset prices and other financial vulnerabilities can pose to the economy. In 2007, it was the bursting of a housing market bubble that took the economy down. In 2001, it was a collapse in stock prices that helped lead to a recession.
 Lately though, Powell has sounded less concerned. In a Sept. 4 interview with National Public Radio, Powell declined to comment on the level of the stock market but did argue that low interest rates don’t necessarily lead to asset bubbles.
 Noting that rates are depressed in part because of increased savings by an aging population and muted inflation, Powell said, “To that extent, there’s no reason why that would lead to, you know, excessive asset prices, for example, in stocks.”

  However, he remained defiant and continued to work behind the scenes. Arteta continued to tell him that his chance would arrive.


  Duly, Nelson came on in the goalless draw at Leeds last weekend for his first league appearance of the campaign, doing a solid job as a half-time substitute as the 10-man Gunners held on for a point.


  Afforded a start against Molde on Thursday night in the Europa League, Nelson impressed, scoring as a much-changed lineup ran out 3-0 winners.


  And Arteta was full of praise for the player’s attitude post-game, admitting that he and his staff have been working individually with Nelson, in extra meetings and sessions requested by the player.
