 "I have always been attracted by the connection between man and nature," Arrechea told _T &C_. "The texts in the installation are from Santiago's soliloquy while at sea, battling with the sharks. My intention is to connect his resilience and strength of spirit to inspire in these times."

The Center Square) – Maine Gov. Janet Mills announced late Tuesday she is quarantining after being exposed to the coronavirus.
 In a news release from her office, Mills said she felt well and wasn’t experiencing any symptoms, but for safety’s sake she would be staying at Blaine House, the governor’s residence, until Dec. 12.
 “I am feeling fine and not experiencing any symptoms whatsoever; but as we have said all along, no one is immune from exposure to this virus,” she said. “I am going to continue working as hard as I can on behalf of Maine people during this quarantine.”
 The news release said that a member of Mills’ protective detail began showing symptoms of COVID-19 on Monday and is awaiting the results of testing to confirm the diagnosis. Mills and the person in question were last in proximity Saturday, when they were both in a car, wearing face coverings, for about 10 minutes.
 Mills worked from her office Monday, and the news release insisted that she and her staff observed social distancing and face covering protocols.
 “Governor Mills will take a PCR test on Thursday, December 3, 2020, which will mark five days since the likely exposure which is within the recommended time period for testing after potential exposure given the number of days it can take the virus to reproduce and be detected, if present,“ the news release stated. “The Office of the Governor will announce those results when they are available.”
 The Maine Republican Party argued that Mills needed to be more forthcoming about who she might have infected Monday, if she contracted the virus from the security staffer.
 "Given the timeline, it is possible that the Governor and her staff may have exposed Democrat Leadership and the Democrat caucus to the virus.” Republican Chair Demi Kouzounas said in a statement. “The possibility of the Governor infecting legislators from all corners of the state is a major public health risk that must be dealt with at once. We call on Janet Mills to immediately provide additional information so the public can understand who may be impacted and if proper protocols were taken."
 As a result of the exposure, Mills is not taking part in the swearing in of the new Legislature Wednesday. Acting Chief Justice of the Maine Supreme Judicial Court Andrew Mead took her place for the proceedings.

Law360 (December 1, 2020, 11:58 PM EST) -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday issued a warning letter to Frito-Lay about conditions at chip factories that led to recalls of its barbecue chips and mislabeled bags of cheddar and sour cream chips.      The FDA said that it had inspected facilities in Washington and California in September after the recalls. The barbecue chips were recalled because of an undeclared milk allergen because the wrong seasoning was used. The other recall was issued because chips labeled as "Ruffles Original Potato Chips" actually contained cheddar and sour cream-flavored chips, according to the letter.      The barbecue chips were made in California...

When I was starting _Before the Storm_ , I was enraptured by the idea--that really came from talking to these guys directly--that they were a scrappy band of underdogs. But then I realized that these are--literally or figuratively-- the same people who Richard Nixon gets on board when he wants to break into offices. Nixon thought that if you want a job done, get a “healthy right-wing exuberant” to do it. The idea that, somehow, they sanded the rough edges off of conservatism is just nonsense. It becomes a different story when you realize that something a lot more cunning and subtle is going on.

_In his podcasts_ Slow Burn _and_ Fiasco _, Leon Neyfakh and his team have covered Watergate, the Monica Lewinsky scandal, the Iran-Contra affair, and more, making seemingly familiar stories feel both fresh and suspenseful. In the third season of_ Fiasco _, Neyfakh turns his attention to the battle over school desegregation in Boston in the 1970s, during which white Northerners took pains to distance themselves from racist Southerners while fighting against school integration in their own city. An activist and two-time mayoral hopeful named Louise Day Hicks led the opposition to Judge W. Arthur Garrity Jr.’s 1974 mandate to desegregate schools. She did so, in large part, by tapping into the sense of grievance many whites felt when presented with the prospect of progressive reforms._
