Leto’s Joker was not in the original _Justice League_ , __ but now Snyder has free rein to execute his truest vision for the film, and that vision involves Leto in grills. Leto’s version of the Joker appearing in _Zack Snyder’s Justice League_ also means that _Suicide Squad_ and _Birds of Prey_ exist in its universe. Snyder’s really going to give the fanboys everything they want in 2021.

Growth away from the field is what Smith hopes will fuel increased success on it, building off a 3-8 debut campaign. With the principles in place from last year, and a bevy of underclassmen thrust into prominent roles, Smith believes he’s got a solid foundation in place.
 Last year’s mark included some unsightly results, including lopsided shutouts at the hands of Strath Haven, Haverford and Garnet Valley. The two Central League wins came against Lower Merion and Harriton. But Penncrest also stuck within one point of Springfield and dropped a 16-7 Thanksgiving Eve decision to Marple Newtown, improving on a 35-8 losing margin from Week 8.
 Continued growth is the mantra across the board. Jimmy Cage returns under center after getting the lion’s share of the snaps last year, going 74-for-135 for 628 yards, five touchdowns and seven interceptions. Kamrin Vaughn, last year’s second-leading receiver at 22 catches for 204 yards and two touchdowns, is back, as is leading rusher Brennan Kaut (328 yards, three scores). Backup quarterback Nick Chelo will likely find a place to contribute in the offense, and Mike Burke offers a platoon option at running back. Dylan McDougall, a 6-2 tight end, presents a big target, and Devian Hartage-Fitzgerald should get some looks in the passing game.
 Many of those players got significant run last year. That was more by necessity than design, but it could pay off this season.

This shared idiom and base of reference is among the factors that allow Yaycı, Erdoğan, and others to find common cause in the service of the Turkish state. That is not to say that partisan or personal differences within this circle are irrelevant. Erdoğan, for example, may part company with Yaycı in leaning closer to Gürdeniz’s animosity towards the United States. In the long term, the common ground shared between these various camps will likely remain critical to the future of Turkish foreign policy. It is for this reason that Yaycı’s vision of a more combative and self-aggrandizing Turkey is likely to endure, if not grow more entrenched, for some time to come.

“Losing isn’t fun,” added junior cornerback/receiver Frank Tropiano. “Putting everything you have into it and still coming up short. It’s not the best feeling in the world.”
 As for Chris Britton, who is entering his seventh season as a head coach, he has a different view on a season that has been turned upside down due to the coronavirus pandemic. First, the season was moved to the spring and then switched back to the fall in an abbreviated six-game format that does not include participation in the playoffs. The Central League has split into two divisions, one with the six Class 6A schools and one with the six Class 5A members. There is a five-game season against teams within the respective divisions and then a final game against the team that finishes in the same spot in the opposite division. No. 1 in 6A plays No. 1 in 5A and down the line.
 “This year it’s not about the playoffs or the wins and losses,” said Britton, whose team opens the season Friday night at Penncrest. “That will all come again when things return to normal. The goal is to play every game on the schedule and have fun with it. Nothing’s been normal and it’s still not, so let’s enjoy it and not take it for granted and get in what they can get in.”
 What Britton does see is a team that has a lot of experience returning. Britton played eight sophomores last year and a number of juniors.

Another reason why we have to put the Chriscourse to bed once and for all is that Chris Pratt isn’t actually that much of an outlier in the assumed conservatism with which some fans take issue. Contrary to popular conservative conspiratorial belief, Hollywood isn’t one big liberal cesspool; as Katharine McPhee, Ice Cube, and Kirstie Alley have demonstrated, there are many Republicans and Trump supporters in their ranks. It’s great that Chris Evans is an outspoken Democrat, but the job of all of these guys is to be a himbo onscreen and a millionaire off, and it’s weird to want more from them instead of amplifying the voices of actual activists who do politics as their _job_. That’s not to say we should just remain silent when celebs are being actively harmful, dumb, or fascist-adjacent. When it comes to the Chrises, it’s fine to ponder how the once-dopey puppy poster boy Andy Dwyer managed to take the Star-Lord role away from Glenn Howerton, thus setting us on a different, darker timeline where Glenn Howerton is not a movie star and instead, we have Trump and COVID and the lame _Jurassic_ reboots. But do we need to have a twice-yearly referendum on whether or not this solidifies him as the worst of his tribe? I’d argue “no.”

"I'll have to reevaluate where I am," Graham said. "I want to be fair, but it's kind of silly to play a game nobody else is playing."          Illinois Democratic Sen. Richard Durbin lamented how the Senate once confirmed liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and conservative Justice Antonin Scalia on overwhelmingly bipartisan votes.          "I don't know how we get this train back on the track. But this nomination at this moment in time, is not usual, not normal, and it's beneath the dignity of this committee," Durbin said.          When McConnell moved forward with Barrett's nomination so close to a presidential election, Durbin said, "it was clear that all bets were off. We are going for this nominee at any price, at any cost. And one of them is the integrity of this committee."          Graham has raised similar concerns about the partisan votes on Supreme Court nominees, but blamed Democrats for focusing on policy fights during confirmation than the nominee's qualifications.          The Barrett nomination comes on the heels of other changes to traditions and norms of the Senate's judicial confirmation process in the past four years that have allowed Republicans to fill the nation's appeals courts with Trump nominees at a record pace. Republicans, for example, ended a Senate rule that would require a Supreme Court nomination to get 60 votes to proceed to a confirmation vote.          Committee Democrats appear to have no appetite for reinstating those if Democrats take control of the Senate in the next Congress that starts in January. And even Delaware Democratic Sen. Chris Coons, known for reaching across the aisle to help maintain Senate courtesy, has signaled that Barrett's confirmation could lift reservations about proposals such as adding justices to the Supreme Court.          "Like Joe Biden, I'm not a fan of expanding the court, but we have a few weeks here to see whether there are four Republicans who will step back from this precipice," Coons told CNN on Sunday. "If we happen to be in a fact pattern where we have a President Biden, we'll have to look at what the right steps are to rebalance the federal judiciary."          And Rhode Island Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse hinted at last week's confirmation hearing for Barrett that pleas from Republicans to not use their power would not resonate.          "There are Republican members on this committee of whom I am very fond. But don't think that when you have established the rule of, 'Because we can,' that, should the shoe be on the other foot, you will have any credibility to come to us and say, 'Yeah, I know you can do that. But you shouldn't, because of X, Y, or Z,'" Whitehouse said.          "Your credibility to make that argument, at any time in the future, will die in this room and on that Senate floor if you continue to proceed in this way," Whitehouse said.          Whitehouse this week said there probably is a way to repair the relationships at the Senate Judiciary Committee after this. "But the problem with rule breakers is that it's hard to trust them that they'd follow the new rule that you agreed to," Whitehouse said. "So, it's not going to be an easy task."          New Jersey Democratic Sen. Cory Booker said Wednesday that Republicans would pause Barrett's confirmation process now "if they listen to their conscience and what was right."          "This is a time that they should be showing the restraint of power. This is the time that they should be waiting and trusting the American people," Booker said. "This is the time that they should be doing what is right."

Health Commissioner Lisa Piercey told reporters in a briefing that the plan is subject to change based on priorities as they emerge and the number of vaccines that initially become available. Tennessee will receive 2 percent of the national allocation from the federal government, which could vary in volume based on how drug candidates perform in clinical trials and manufacturing capabilities.
 Vaccines likely become available on a rolling basis over the course of weeks or months and in “very limited quantities,” according to health department officials. They will not be administered to special populations such as children and pregnant women.
 "We assure Tennesseans that safe, effective and approved COVID-19 vaccines will be released in Tennessee when they are available," Piercey said in a press release detailing the plan. "Our vaccine distribution plan will be modified as more is understood about the virus and the availability of approved vaccines currently in development."
 Several vaccine candidates have begun stage-three clinical trials but none so far have been, or are scheduled to be, authorized for use by the federal government. A committee within the Food and Drug Administration that will be responsible for vetting the efficacy of vaccine candidates — Meharry Medical College President James Hildreth was appointed to serve on it last week — will meet for the first time Thursday.

Freshman starter Cade Ballard -- he had that one snap in the first game of the season -- only rushed three times for 5 yards, but after the Roadrunners pulled within 21-16 early in the fourth quarter Ballard responded like a veteran on the ensuing possession, guiding the Black Knights to a touchdown that put UTSA back on its heels. The drive featured Ballard's first college completion and the only one for Army in the game -- a 53-yarder to senior wide receiver Cam Harrison that put the ball at the UTSA 5 -- and his first career touchdown run on the next play. Ballard's partner, sophomore Tyhier Tyler, gained 95 yards on 19 carries, did not attempt a pass, and scored the lone touchdown of the third quarter on a 37-yard run, the only blemish on his performance a lost fumble in the fourth quarter that gave UTSA a chance.

The $225 million civil settlement announced Wednesday resolved allegations that board members including Richard Sackler, David Sackler, Mortimer Sackler and other family members urged Purdue executives find a way to pump up OxyContin sales in 2012 when the legitimate market for opioids had contracted, the Department of Justice said.          Under a plan the family members approved,          titled "Evolve to Excellence," Purdue sales reps stepped up their OxyContin marketing to high-volume prescribers, which resulted in the addictive pills being used in ways that were "unsafe, ineffective and medically unnecessary," the government said.          As part of its 2019 bankruptcy case, Purdue is proposing a opioid settlement deal worth more than $10 billion, calling for Sackler family members to hand over the company and all its assets to a trust controlled by the states, cities and counties suing it. As part of that proposal, members of the Sackler family would contribute $3 billion themselves.          Joe Rice, a lawyer for state and local governments suing Purdue, said the federal deal was a step in the right direction. "This should help us get the most value possible for Purdue's assets and provide more funds to address this country's opioid problems," Rice said in an interview.          But numerous state attorneys general, led by Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey and New York Attorney General Letitia James, oppose the Sackler's bankruptcy offer. They want the family to dig into their own pockets for additional billions, and they pledged to continue their own investigations.          "DOJ failed," Healey said in an emailed statement on Wednesday. "Justice in this case requires exposing the truth and holding the perpetrators accountable, not rushing a settlement to beat an election. I am not done with Purdue and the Sacklers."          A bankruptcy audit last year uncovered $10.4 billion in company transfers engineered by family members since 2008. Some of that money went to offshore trusts and holding companies controlled by the Sacklers. On the eve of the plea's announcement, Justice Department lawyers urged Drain to limit creditors' investigations into billions of dollars some members of the Sackler family took out of Purdue.          Prosecutors argued in an Oct. 19 letter that forcing family members to hand over to creditors files produced during the Justice Department's OxyContin marketing probe would provide a disincentive in future cases for targets to cooperate with the government.          It's not the first time Purdue agreed to plead guilty to criminal charges over OxyContin. In 2007, the drugmaker and three of its top executives pleaded guilty to "misbranding" the painkiller, resulting in more than $630 million in civil and criminal penalties — one of the largest pharmaceutical settlements in U.S. history at the time.          As part of that accord, Purdue specifically acknowledged it trained its sales representatives to mislead physicians about OxyContin's addiction risks. The executives were sentenced to community service and served no jail time.

It has been estimated that anywhere from 14% to 20% of American adults experience seasonal mood changes. Here are some things that you can do to beat the ‘winter blues’ this year. Hot weather during the summer meant that it was easy to socialize in a safe, socially-distanced manner. It is very important to maintain a level of social connection during the colder months as well. If you can, try to dress warmly and go for a walk with family or friends. If this is not possible, stay in touch with your friends and family using social media or video conferencing platforms. Try to get as much natural sunlight as you can, as well as at least 20 minutes of vigorous activity four times a week. When our skin is exposed to sunlight, our bodies produce vitamin D, which can help to combat seasonal depression. The mornings might be getting darker, but it is still best to set an alarm and stick to a regular sleep schedule. It is also very important to be kind to yourself and take breaks when they are needed
