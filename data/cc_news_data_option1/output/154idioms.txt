Once again, we lament that sacrifices of our soldiers and commoners haven't been appreciated, acknowledged and applauded. US, on the other hand, blames that we’ve been in it to mint dollars and dollars alone while shielding, even actively abating the ‘good Taliban’ who weigh the lives on our side of the border differently than Afghan ones where they wreak havoc. It reminds one of the word ‘frenemy’-A friend who is an enemy, an apt word to summarize the recent sparring between Pakistan and USA. If Pak-India relation resembles the ‘Saas-Bahu’one then Pak-US relationship graduated from friends with benefit to a marriage of convenience gone stale.

A falling out between twitter-happy Mr. T and his Pakistani counterparts inauspiciously happened on the very first day of 2018. Allegations of a double game by Mr. Trump were countered by naming the sins on part of US by Pakistani gentlemen from the civilian and military side (Yes, both are on the same page. Whose page this is, we don't know). America had suspended security aid to Pakistan entirely and put it on a watch list for violations of religious freedom. Both countries have been to similar places before. The Pak-US relations, as old as Pakistan itself, have braved the betrayals (Read 65 and 71 wars) and outlived bonhomie (Read Ayub’s initial tenure, Musharraf’s era and Afghan War) multiple times.

In America, anyone can become President. That’s the problem.’ remarked the legendary comedian late George Carlin known for his scathing wit, piercing humor and ability to mock the failings and foibles of the so-called high and mighty. Carlin, who died a decade back in 2008, is not around to witness first hand and ridicule the rise and ravaging of Mr. Donald Trump’s (Mr. T) presidency and is desperately missed. The problem Carlin pointed out has become the real, orange-faced, and straight out of reality TV predicament. Not only the US but the entire world looks gape mouthed at the shenanigans and silliness of Mr. T.

The United States has made progress in residential desegregation since the passage of the Fair Housing Act in 1968. Segregation between whites and blacks, as measured by demographers, declined by roughly a third between 1970 and 2010, according to statistical analysis by University of Michigan sociologist William Frey. Nevertheless, there is still a long way to go toward the ideal of discrimination-free housing. To cite just one example, a recently published undercover investigation by the Long Island, New York-based newspaper Newsday found that real estate agents subjected 40% of minority "testers" posing as homebuyers to disadvantageous treatment relative to whites.
   
 Recognizing the unfinished business, the Obama administration in 2015 promulgated a new regulation pursuant to the Fair Housing Act's requirement that the federal government "affirmatively . . . further the policies of" the 1968 law. The regulation would have put teeth into that long-underenforced provision by requiring cities and towns to examine housing patterns for evidence of unlawful discrimination, then formulate plans to overcome it, as a condition of eligibility for federal housing and development aid.
   
 Now, however, the Trump administration has formalized plans to undo the Obama- era rule. On Tuesday, it released a draft rule that would water down the definition of "affirmatively furthering fair housing." The 2015 rule called for "meaningful actions" that "replac[e] segregated living patterns with truly integrated and balanced living patterns"; now merely "advancing fair housing choice within the program participant's control or influence" will pass muster with the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
   
 This is disturbing, but not at all surprising, in light of previous Republican opposition to President Barack Obama's policy, specifically that of current Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, who, as a presidential candidate, denounced the 2015 rule as "social engineering" akin to other "failed socialist experiments." Already in 2018, Carson had delayed implementation of the 2015 rule's tough new reporting requirements and got rid of a computer tool that was supposed to help communities comply with it.
   
 A federal judge upheld Carson's authority to take those previous steps -- which is not the same as saying he was wise to do so, much less to issue the Tuesday pronouncement. The history of housing discrimination in this country is in significant part a history of deliberate government policy, not market forces or individual choice. Ghettos such as those in Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland and Baltimore, in fact, reflect federal policies of the mid-20th century that made segregation a condition for federal support of various kinds. That was social engineering of the most shameful sort.
   
 Enacted in the aftermath of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination and the violent urban uprisings triggered by that killing, the Fair Housing Act represented a decision by Congress and then-President Lyndon Johnson that the federal government would, at last, join the battle for fair and equal access to living space in this country, after decades in which it had fought on the wrong side. Under President Donald Trump and Carson, Washington is sounding a retreat.
