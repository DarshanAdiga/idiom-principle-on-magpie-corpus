After an eight-week programme of sleeping on a VeSTIM mattress, every participant who took part in the study had an increase in blood flow.


  But the study concluded that future research is now required to explore the potential of active mattress use in the treatment and management of diseases and conditions.


  This could include heart diseases: the biggest cause of death worldwide. Until now, the methods to prevent these diseases have been focused on exercise and diet. The research monitored cardiovascular health by measuring blood flow, blood pressure and the repair of damaged blood vessels.


  It focused on measuring the function of the Endothelium, which lines all blood vessels. Problems here can lead to multiple disorders including diabetes, deep vein thrombosis, heart failure and skin damage. Participants experienced an average improvement in endothelial function of 197% during the eight week programme.


  A common circulatory disorder is cold feet. After the Squirrel VeSTIM® programme, participants reported having warmer feet whilst in bed. The measurements confirmed an increase of 3.5°C, at the big toe, in the laboratory, just hours later. This showed that more blood was flowing to the edges of the body.


  An increase in blood flow during sleep is also a major discovery for the sports industry, the research said. The majority of athletes focus on improving their fitness, which coincides with an increase in cardiovascular health. Participants, who were all healthy, showed an average blood flow increase of 336%.

 # Boonville falls to Odessa in three sets in Class 3 District 14 championship game
 Chris Bowie
 Boonville Daily News
 It wasn’t meant to be Wednesday night for the Boonville Lady Pirates volleyball team.
 Facing the top-seeded Odessa Bulldogs for the title in the Class 3 District 14 Tournament at Odessa, the Lady Pirates couldn’t seem to get anything going offensively while falling in three straight sets 15-25, 9-25 and 16-25.
 Boonville closed out the season at 15-10 overall.
 “This didn’t end the way we wanted,” said Boonville coach Dina Herzog. “I’ve watched this team grow and work hard to achieve goals we set. We played well at times tonight but our inconsistency against a good team shortened our season. Our offense had trouble scoring and defense couldn’t withstand Odessa’s threat at the net. Our seniors were such great leaders all season. I’m proud of their contribution.”
 Odessa, 15-3 on the season, will now face the winner of Maryville-Savannah-the winner of District 16-on Saturday, Oct. 31 at the site of the District 15 winner.
 Needless to say, the match between Boonville and Odessa had the makings of another five-set thriller between two evenly matched teams on paper.
 The first set was true to form as Boonville and Odessa played to five ties at 1-1, 3-3, 6-6, 7-7 and 8-8. Only one point also separated the two teams at 14-13 with the Lady Bulldogs leading. However a string of errors paved the way for Odessa to reel off five unanswered points to go up 19-13-a lead they would never relinquish for the rest of the match.
 Odessa picked up where they left off in the second set by reeling off three straight points. But again the Lady Pirates battled to tie the set at 4-all and even took the lead at 6-5 after a hit out of bounds by Odessa. However it was pretty much all Lady Bulldogs after that as Odessa came back and outscored Boonville 9-0 to go up 14-6. The Lady Pirates would score only three points for the rest of the set as Odessa again took advantage of Boonville errors to win 25-9.
 Down two sets in the best three out of five, the Lady Pirates opened up the third set with a service point by senior Sophi Waibel. However, errors and miscommunication on the floor by Boonville allowed Odessa to extend its lead by as much as 12 at one point at 22-10. The Lady Pirates never got any closer than eight after that as Odessa closed out the match with a Boonville hitting error to secure the win.
 Kennedy Renfrow and Lillian Rohrbach led the team with four service points. Nora Morris and Madison Smith each had a team-leading five kills while Waibel led the team with four blocks. Renfrow also had a team high 20 digs while Addi Brownfield finished the game with 11 assists.
 Brownfield also finished the match with 13 digs, 16 attack attempts and two service points while Morris added 22 attack attempts, three blocks and two assists, Waibel with four digs, two kills on 16 attack attempts and two service points with three aces, Jodie Bass with six digs, two kills on 21 attack attempts and one assist, Renfrow with four service points and three attack attempts, Madison Smith with five kills on 15 attack attempts and one block, Genae Hodge with 11 attack attempts, four digs and two service points and Rohrbach with 10 digs and two attack attempts.

"I am entirely satisfied that Sean Emmett was violent to Abigail at times and it may be that the violence was sometimes mutual."


  Mr Emmett also had convictions for breaching a domestic violence protection order in 2014 made to protect his third wife Lana Saoud and was convicted of battery against her in 2015.


  Despite the evidence of violence, the coroner resisted suggestions made by Ms Elson's family that Mr Emmett could be responsible for her death, instead making a neutral "open conclusion."


  Ms Hewitt stressed that although she believed Mr Emmett had beaten his wife, this did not prove he had attacked her before she fell or that he was responsible for the death.


  Concluding the inquest, Ms Hewitt said: "I do not consider that Sean Emmett has provided me with a full and truthful account.


  "My conclusion that I cannot rely on Sean Emmet's account of what happened simply leaves me unable decide what happened and where the truth lies.


  "An open conclusion is the appropriate conclusion, if the evidence has failed to satisfy me to the required standard of proof for any other conclusion."


  Abigail's parents, the Rev. Christopher Elson and his wife Carolyn, refused to comment after the inquest and left the court via a back door.

Pucovski has scored all four of his Sheffield Shield hundreds batting at number three and the 22-year-old was adamant this week he would be batting there again as the Vics began their summer against South Australia in Glenelg. But after the inexperienced Victorian bowlers ran through a limp Redbacks batting line-up, rolling them for just 200 on a green pitch with three players making ducks, Pucovski went in to open late in the day with former Test batsman Marcus Harris. Rogers, a former Test opener himself, moved last summer’s leading Shield run scorer Nic Maddinson, to number four promoting Pucocski who was unbeaten on 18 and the Vics 0-38 after surviving 14 final session overs. “I just felt it’s the right team balance for a challenging year, with young bowlers, and Will has the skills to be an excellent opening batsman,” Rogers said. Before Pucovski went out to bat the next gerenation of Australian fast bowling talent stepped up to the plate and Victoria’s youthful attack put South Australia to the sword. Curators turned the tables after 12 hundreds were scored in the opening two rounds and green wickets were the order of the day as a trio of young Vics with just five first class matches to their name shined. Will Sutherland, who boasted all five of those games was part of a frontline attack for Victorian which included first- gamers Mitch Perry and Zac Evans who ran through the Redbacks with even Test number six Travis Head struggling, making just nine off 45 balls. Sutherland took 3-26 and only some lusty late hitting from tailender Wes Agar, who took 14 off four balls form Perry before the young Victorian had him caught behind, got the Redbacks to 200. It was some effort first-up for the Vics who started their season two weeks after all the other teams after a hard-quarantine in Adelaide. “It wasn’t the ideal preparation but having that delayed start to the season allowed our young quicks to get ready and that showed,” Sutherland said. “I thought it was good for a few of our debutantes to be bowling first. They could have had two or three wickets each. I think we’ve already clicked pretty well.” Rogers lauded the potential of his new bowlers declaring 20-year-old Perry, who took 2-35, could be a leader of the attack. “The one thing I had heard about when I joined the squad and from what I have seen he has a really good ability to make the ball swing,” Rogers said. “He’s very much ready to be one of the leaders of our attack already.” Spinner Jon Holland also took two wickets and Rogers said he was the second-best spinner in Australia behind Nathan Lyon, “And if you needed someone to bowl fourth- innings, in tandem with Nathan Lyon at the SCG in the third Test you might want to consider him,” he said.

The other reason I feel the Dolphins will fade from potentially the playoffs is the schedule. The Dolphins will have to be sharp. They play the Kansas City Chiefs, Los Angeles Rams, and Los Angels Chargers all at home. Then have road games against the Arizona Cardinals, Denver Broncos, Las Vegas Raiders, and Buffalo Bills. It's not an impossible schedule, but a tough one to say the least. The Bills they play in the season finale and if they could stay within a game of the Bills that game could be for the division title. I feel the Bills right now are the best team in the AFC East as hard as it is for me to say that. I feel they will win the division and it's a matter of how by many games. I know the Bills are 5-2 and the Dolphins are 3-3, but the Bills already beat us in our backyard. The Bills schedule is just as tough, but they were in the playoffs last year and the Dolphins are still learning how to win. If the Dolphins win the AFC East, it would be because they grew up faster or the Bills aren't that good.

Funded with £1 million from AHDB, Dairy UK, Defra, as well as the devolved governments, the campaign aimed to address the drop in liquid milk demand caused by the closure of foodservice outlets due to Covid.


  Processors helped to bring multiple retailers on board with the campaign and drove additional engagement on social media through dairy brands and industry organisations.


  Paul Flanagan, AHDB Dairy strategy director said the campaign was an example of industry and government pulling together during a crisis, with 'fantastic results'.


  "Every £1 spent on media, turned into £13.99 of retail sales," he said, “It shows just how much can be achieved when industry and government are all pulling in the same direction.”


  ‘Milk Your Moments’ was created to inspire moments of connection as people were forced to stay apart due to the coronavirus crisis.


  It highlighted the role dairy plays during difficult times, with people visiting the campaign website to receive a ‘inspirational moment of connection’ to share on social media with £1 donated to mental health charities. £100,000 was raised overall.


  Consisting of social media, website, billboards outside supermarkets and, for the first time in 20 years, television advertising, the campaign contributed £6.6m of milk sales, equivalent to 11.2m litres, to the overall uplift.


  Dr Judith Bryans, chief executive of Dairy UK said: “Everyone involved in the development of this campaign went into it with a very positive mindset wanting to reassure them that dairy has always been with them and would continue to be with them through this crisis.


  “The uplift in sales that was achieved and the positive behaviour changes evidenced by the results reflect the fact that the campaign’s messages resonated with consumers.”
