Ideal zum Abschluss der Feiertage, die Bibelfilmparodie der britischen "Monty Python"-Anarchisten. Weil sich die drei Weisen im Stall irren, huldigen sie nicht Jesus, sondern Brian. Von nun an ist dieser Opfer von Irrtum und Verwechslung. Nach einer aberwitzigen Odyssee endet der vermeintliche Messias am Kreuz – und singt: "Always Look on the Bright Side of Life"… Gotteslästerung? Nö, hier bekommen nur Fanatiker ihr Fett weg!

It must be noted that staying injury free since his stint at Churchill Brothers in 2017 has been one of the major factors behind Brandon's emergence. Before that season, Brandon was always troubled by injuries. He had injury- ridden stints Sporting Clube de Goa and Mumbai City FC before that. But the season with Churchill is where it all started to turn around for him.

Bucks County is awaiting a last-minute decision on whether or not the mail-in ballot deadline will be extended for Tuesday's primary election.
   
 The county on Thursday filed an emergency petition in the Court of Common Pleas to allow ballots postmarked by June 1 to still be counted if they arrive as late as 5 p.m. June 9. Under current state law, ballots must be received by the Board of Elections by 8 p.m. Tuesday, regardless of their postmark.
   
 Judge James M. McMaster heard the petition Friday morning. Bucks County Clerk Gail Humphrey said Friday that McMaster would hold his decision until 1:30 p.m. Tuesday. He instructed the county Board of Elections and Bucks County officials to reach out and notify all candidates on the ballot.
   
 Humphrey said McMaster felt the candidate should have the ability to voice their opinion on the topic, should they choose to.
   
 The petition also asks the court to set the extension no sooner than June 4, if approved.
   
 County Commissioner Chairwoman Diane Ellis Marseglia Marseglia said a combination of issues factored into the county's petition, including the coronavirus pandemic and a surge in mail-in and absentee ballots.
   
 This will also be the first time the county has used new voting machines that use hand-marked paper ballots in a countywide election. They were used in March during a special election in Bensalem for the 18th district state house seat.
   
 The petition adds that social distancing restrictions from the pandemic also slowed the county from processing mail-in ballot applications the same day they were received, a goal set prior to the pandemic.
   
 Humphrey said Thursday that about 3,000 mail-in ballot applications came into the county on May 28 alone, the last day to register.
   
 While the county is expected to have finished mailing out all the recently applied-for ballots by Friday, the U.S. Postal Service has indicated previously it may take up to seven to 10 days to reach those voters.
   
 The Pennsylvania Department of State has recommended voters hand deliver their ballots to their county offices if they have not mailed them as of May 28.
   
 Voters who have already mailed in their ballots, but aren't sure the county will receive them in time, should go to their polling place to cast a provisional ballot.
   
 In the event a voter has cast both a mail-in ballot and provisional ballot, the provisional ballot will be discarded, according to the state department.
   
 Barring an approval of the county's petition, ballots with postmark dates prior to June 2 will not be counted.
   
 Nearly 100,000 Bucks County voters have requested mail-in ballots in recent months, with the state reporting about 22% of those ballots returned to the county as of Wednesday.
   
 Nearly 70,000 Democrats and 30,000 Republicans have seen their mail-in applications approved.
   
 About 22% of Democrats and 20% of Republicans have returned their ballots in Bucks County, according to the state data.
   
 Montgomery County attempted a similar petition this week, but was ultimately denied on Wednesday.
   
 Attorneys in that case claimed an unknown number of ballots had been mailed incorrectly using Pennsylvania's Statewide Uniform Registry of Electors information.
   
 A change to the system caused apartment numbers to not be included in address labels, resulting in many ballots being returned to the county and resent.
   
 That petition is now being appealed in state court.
   
 Humphery said Bucks County was able to avoid that missing apartment issue when election staff reviewed each voter's information before mailing the ballots.

Selling houses when people are supposed to shelter at home is a paradox that Pennsylvania real estate professionals have come to know so well this spring.
   
 "We were looking for a phenomenal market. We were thinking this spring would be the best," said William Festa, president of the Pennsylvania Association of Realtors.
   
 Then the coronavirus came to town.
   
 Sales that were flowing smoothly suddenly dropped to a trickle when the Gov. Tom Wolf issued an order in mid March that labeled the real estate industry a nonessential casualty of the pandemic. Only transactions that could be conducted without home showings could be completed.
   
 Scott Geller, president of the Bucks County Association of Realtors, said home showings dropped 90% across the state.
   
 Now there's a glimmer of hope the spring selling season won't be a total washout.
   
 Earlier this month, Wolf issued new guidelines that will allow in-person home showings and sales to take place as long as strict social distancing and other protections against the virus are carried out.
   
 "The economic impact of a typical home sale in Pennsylvania is over $65,000," Geller said, citing the income generated from real estate industries, expenditures related to home purchases, new home construction, and multiple service providers. "You can see why opening up real estate is so important to our overall economy."
   
 Now, as businesses are gradually allowed to resume, Pennsylvania's 35,000 Realtors are finding they are facing a new normal. Will homes start to sell again?
   
 "We're cautiously optimistic," said Kim Shindle, PAR spokeswoman.
   
 The National Association of Realtors' chief economist Lawrence Yun predicts home sales will decline 10% to 15% this year but increase 13% to 18% next year, as home prices increase up to 3%, Geller said.
   
 With so many people having been furloughed or laid off from their jobs over the past two months, Festa said it's vitally important for potential home buyers to know whether they will qualify for a mortgage and for what amount before they begin shopping for a home. He said most mortgage companies require a person to be working for a company for two years, but under the present circumstances, if someone is furloughed and then hired back, exceptions may be made.
   
 Festa said rebooting the industry won't come soon enough for some people who may be experiencing "financial struggles or personal difficulties," like a divorce, and who need to make a move soon.
   
 "There's so much anxiety," said Realtor Frank Blumenthal, of Kellers Williams Real Estate in Abington. "Managing the chaos is where Realtors are finding their business right now. You have to have a degree in psychology."
   
 Blumenthal, who labels his business Real Estate Solutions Provider, has had a few settlements close in the past month and even has people wanting to buy a house in Lower Moreland sight unseen because they want their children to go to school there.
   
 He's also worked with a doctor who was furloughed and then hired back a day later, just as she was supposed to go to settlement. Her mortgage lender allowed the deal to proceed.
   
 Mortgage broker Stan Reinford, of Quaint Oak Mortgage in Southampton, said that mortgage rates now are very low, in the 3% to 4% range, for 30-year mortgages, and even lower for 15-year loans. He has handled many refinances during this time as people who aren't moving still want to lower their interest rate or take out an equity loan to improve their home.
   
 If someone who was furloughed "gets their job back and they verify employment, we should be able to close (on a house)," Reinford said.
   
 Pam Croke, CEO of the Bucks Realtors association, said that real estate agents now, more than ever, need to know how to pivot if they're trying to help someone buy or sell a home and a problem arises. Sometimes a new approach will work.
   
 "We are going to be looking at best practices to incorporate social distancing," she said. "Our association has been very busy to make sure Realtors have everything they need to get up and running," when they can start showing homes again.
   
 There are so many variables, depending on each buyer's and seller's needs. "We're all in the same storm, but not in the same boat," Croke said, quoting a saying she finds apropos.
   
 "It's unprecedented. That word is used so much but it's the truth," she said.
