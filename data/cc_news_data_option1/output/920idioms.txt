As billing and invoice maker is crucial for every business, a good invoice maker app should allow the user to enter the buyer’s, products and services data and payment terms. As a business rule of thumb, the buyer is given 60 days at max to pay. This information is vital to the seller as he or she can keep track of payments received and defaulters. You might be selling goods on installments, and whenever the buyer sends you an installment payment, it should be recorded and updated. When a buyer makes a payment to the seller, the receipt generator app should generate a receipt for this transaction. Like this, both the seller and the buyer can track payments received and made against an invoice.

A lack of debt, Palmer said, sets the tone.
 “I think it gives you a clean slate with regards to expansion of programming, expansion of structure, expansion of membership,” he said. “It kind of gives you that forthrightness in regards to getting into the community and saying, 'Look we can do this now and we haven't been able to do this in the past. We are completely debt free.'”
 It can also a bit of pressure, Palmer said.
 “There is that sense of excitement, but also at the same time that sense of failure where you have to be responsible with what you're going to do to maintain that line of debt free,” he said.
 In his first 90 days as CEO, Palmer wants to do an analytical review “of what the facility should look like, what it does look like and what it will look like.”
 He said there are facilities issues that likely need to be addressed. He also noted the unique programs the Blair Family YMCA offers, including the bingo program and the youth leadership academy.
 “I think there are some little things that can be done in regards to the sports and rec programs and some of the senior programs,” he said.
 Palmer said he is most excited about leading the existing staff and making changes to the facility into a team that best benefits Blair.
 “I believe my leadership characteristics are second to none to be very honest with you,” he said. “The respect level of my staff historically has been very high. I support them, I appreciate them and I think I'm looking forward to that most as working as a team and establishing this Y in the Blair community for what it can be, not necessarily what it is right now.”
 A reception for Palmer will be 5 to 7 p.m. March 31 at the Heartland Tasting Room. The community is invited.
