Peripheral manufacturer 8BitDo is best known for making retro- inspired controllers, but for its latest act the company is doing something different. Instead of yet another Switch-focused controller, 8BitDo is releasing a new Bluetooth gamepad designed for use with Microsoft's Project xCloud game streaming service. The $45 SN30 Pro for Xbox adapts the same underlying design as the company's SN30 Pro+, symmetrical analog sticks and all, but won't be out of place in your Xbox controller collection. 8BitDo says it's compatible with all Android devices, with battery life coming in at about 18-hours on a single charge. The SN30 Pro also comes with the company's Ultimate Software, which allows you to customize button mappings, as well as adjust the sensitivity of the stick and triggers. You can also create multiple controller profiles and switch between them on the fly. The included clip can accommodate phones with a width as wide 86mm, making it compatible with chubby devices like the Galaxy S20 Ultra and OnePlus 8 Pro. If you want to push the clip to its limit, you can even mount something like the Mate 20 X with its big 7.2-inch display. 8BitDo Alongside the new SN30 Pro, 8BitDo is releasing a separate set of smartphone clips that you can attach to one of your existing Xbox controllers. The $15 collection comes with multiple clips that work with the standard and Elite variants of the Xbox One controller. There's also a clip you'll be able to use with the new Xbox Series X gamepad when it becomes available later this year. Like the clip that comes with the SN30 Pro, the set can accommodate phones between 49mm and 86mm wide. Both the SN30 and Xbox Gaming Clips are available to pre-order today. They'll start shipping on September 21st.

Surely the people of Scotland, Wales and Ulster have every right to protest when they hear the expression "British exceptionalism". As the former MP Phillip Lee insisted on a recent Channel 4 Dispatches, the source of the government's disastrous mishandling of the Covid-19 crisis is English exceptionalism. Current scientific opinion would appear to suggest that thousands of deaths could have been avoided if the lockdown had been introduced a week or two earlier. Was the failure to do so the result of a stubborn refusal to learn from other countries' experiences? How much was this due to the mistaken belief in English exceptionalism, initially and cynically promoted by Boris Johnson in the 2016 referendum campaign? Where will this ridiculous and dangerous illusion take us in the post-Covid world, apart from down a very slippery path to further national humiliation and economic disaster? Anthony WestAlastair Campbell is right in his latest column, it is weird right now. Hearing people who are running the government's programmes because they are, allegedly, a genius, making apparently serious statements about going for a long drive to test their eyesight; watching the prime minister's excruciatingly embarrassing and evasive defence of such statements; and yes, seeing the health secretary, and others use obfuscation and evasion in attempts to conceal the truth, which is that they made mistakes and did not manage coronavirus well. The use of lying by the government became routine before, and subsequent to, the referendum to leave the EU. Preposterous lies about the positive gains from Brexit were flaunted on buses and elsewhere. This, I believe, has led to large sections of the public not caring. The message is, "it's ok to use whatever means to get what you want". This may explain the extraordinary public response to the lockdown relaxation, the invasion of the beaches in Dorset, apparently uncaring of the potential for infection and uncaring for the environment by littering, and barbecuing in forests. One answer for Alastair may be that, because governments have a duty to lead by example, being honest about their motives, admitting mistakes (we all make mistakes) and setting standards that the public can respect, and, the present government does none of these, there should be a cross party opposition response whenever the government uses lies or evasion. Keir Starmer cannot do it alone. Pat Brandwood BroadstoneI empathise with Alastair Campbell. Watching ministers consistently getting away with not answering the question, being economical with the truth and creating successes out of obvious failings was laughable to begin with but rapidly became even more depressing than the crass antics of a few Burnley supporters. The only answer to the utterly depressing state of our politics and our government is to join the rest of the world in laughing at us. That's one thing we used to be quite good at that. Admittedly the fact that we need to do this is in itself depressing, but at least from July 4 we can all do what the ministers clearly want us to and go down the pub. Come to think of it, isn't that even more depressing? Phil Green• Have your say by emailing theneweuropean@archant.co.uk.

China just recently imposed a new national security law on Hong Kong, a region not subject to the country's restrictive "Great Firewall" that censors the internet throughout the country. However, legal experts believe the new law gives police the power to order individuals and companies to remove content. But despite the law, it sounds like Facebook isn't immediately going to comply. According to the Wall Street Journal, Facebook's WhatsApp will pause any processing of requests for user data from Hong Kong police while it reviews the new regulation. WhatsApp was the first Facebook company to confirm it wouldn't process these government requests, but now it sounds like all of Facebook will hold off on reviewing data requests.A WhatsApp spokesperson told the Wall Street Journal that the company was looking at the impact of the new law specifically focusing on "formal human rights due diligence and consultations with human rights experts." Legal experts believe the new law doesn't let Hong Kong fully block services or website, which China's notorious "Great Firewall" does -- but Facebook's refusal to comply with the law could certainly put the company at odds with the Chinese government. Given that Hong Kong has long lived with an open and free internet, it'll be worth seeing if any other companies follow suit with Facebook's refusal to comply with the new regulation. It'll also be significant to see how China's responds to Facebook's decision, particularly if other companies join Facebook and push back against the new law. Last year, Apple eventually complied with China's demands for it to remove a Hong Kong protest-tracking app, a move that was criticized as the company bowing to governmental pressure. Whether Facebook will do an eventual about-face remains to be seen.

JANESVILLE, Wis. — At first Jennifer Drach thought someone was playing a trick on her.
 The curator at the Rock County Historical Society was looking through a recently donated book when a photo of Abraham Lincoln fell out.
 Not just any photo.
 But an original Lincoln photograph taken in 1861.
 “The rare photo is a once-in-a-lifetime find,” Drach told The Janesville Gazette. “You hear stories about things like this happening.”
 Drach learned from her uncle that, years ago, people often put photos, notes and cards in books to preserve them and to keep them flat.
 But she had no idea what a treasure awaited her when she flipped through the 19th-century “Abraham Lincoln: Man of God” by John Wesley Hill.
 Drach immediately called Bob and Gay Yeomans of Janesville to tell them what was in the book they donated.
 “They didn’t miss a beat,” Drach said. “They said, ‘We are so happy you found it. Keep the photo. Now thousands of people can enjoy it.’”
 The accidental gift was among many donations to the Rock County Historical Society from the Yeomans family this spring.
 Angie Yeomans, through her son, Bob, and daughter-in-law, Gay, donated 120 items, including furniture, silverware, a silver bread warmer, an English print, linens and books.
 The well-cared-for items have not been appraised, but historical society Executive Director Timothy Maahs called them priceless.
 Most of the pieces date from 1860 to 1880 and were handed down in the Yeomans family.
 Many items already have been incorporated in the Lincoln-Tallman House.
 Drach said it will be mid-summer before the Lincoln photo goes on display, maybe in the Lincoln bedroom of the 1857 mansion. She explained that it will be properly matted, framed and put under museum-quality glass.
 “The photo is so well-preserved,” she said. “There was no image transfer of ink into the book where we found it.”
 Other treasures
 A carriage blanket from the Yeomans family also has ties to the 16th president of the United States.
 Lincoln visited Janesville from Oct. 1 to 3, 1859, and stayed with the Tallman family.
 So it is fitting that society historians draped the red blanket with shades of tan and green on the bed in the Lincoln bedroom.
 “It’s in impeccable condition,” Maahs said, adding that the Yeomans family did an amazing job of preserving it.
 The donation included a handwritten letter documenting that the circa-1850 blanket belonged to Asahel Gridley, who practiced law with Lincoln and became his good friend.
 “It is extremely difficult to find items with documentation and a connection to Mr. Lincoln,” Maahs said.
 Most likely, the carriage blanket came through Asahel’s daughter, Mary Gridley Bell, to the Yeomans family.
 In addition to the blanket, the family’s donation includes a number of period furniture items.
 An ornately carved settee sits in the main entry hall, where visitors might have waited for the Tallman family.
 A large bureau with a mirror reflects stylish Victorian taste in the dining room.
 And the mansion’s dumbwaiter now holds period serving pieces.
 “The best compliments I have received while doing private tours is that the items literally make it look like the family just got up and walked out of the room,” Maahs said.
 He is eager to share the donations, which he hopes will “inspire folks to learn more about the rich history of the area and the people who have come before us.”
 Maahs called his interaction with the Yeomans family heartwarming and authentic.
 “This is exactly how local historical societies are able to survive,” he said, “through the generosity of people who care about these things. I can’t say enough. I feel so blessed for the historical society to have gotten such a beautiful gift.”
 Bob Yeomans explained how the donation happened.
 His mother, 99-year-old Angie, recently moved from a 160-acre farm north of Janesville to Cedar Crest. His father, Floyd or “Bud,” died in 2010.
 “My parents lived a wonderful life at the farm,” Yeomans said. “They had a fairly large house filled with antique furniture handed down for generations in the family and other pieces of interest.”
 After family members took some items, Yeomans contacted Maahs to see if the historical society was interested in the rest.
 “He was like a kid in a candy store,” Yeomans said. “It made me so happy to see someone excited about these pieces. There’s great joy in giving, particularly where there is great joy in receiving. Emotionally, it is of great value to us to know the pieces are in a good home and many people will enjoy them.”
