DETROIT (AP) -- For the second time this month, Hyundai is telling some SUV owners to park outdoors because an electrical short in a computer can cause vehicles to catch fire. The Korean automaker is recalling about 180,000 Tucson SUVs in the U.S. from 2019 through 2021 to fix the problem. The company says corrosion can cause a short circuit in defective anti-lock brake circuit boards that can start a fire. Hyundai says it knows of a dozen engine fires from the problem but no injuries. Hyundai will notify owners around Oct. 30. Dealers will replace the anti-lock brake control computers.

NEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. national security concerns about the world's dominant consumer drone-maker, China-based DJI, have upended the market for small drones. Bans on the use of DJI drones by some government agencies have opened the door to lesser-known companies pitching applications for government agencies and big businesses. Some of those companies are also tapping into a technological revolution that could do away with the need for human pilots to put drones through each one of their paces. Instead, advanced artificial intelligence is starting to power drones that can follow humans and other targets on their own.

Leicester are set to play as guests to West Bromwich Albion in their 2020-21 league opener on Sunday.
 "James [Maddison] and Fuchsy [Christian Fuchs] have been training this week, so that’s good news. It’ll be brilliant to see them back on the pitch," Rodgers told pressmen in his team news ahead of Sunday's fixture, his club's official website reports.
 "Dan Amartey has just come back in. He played 45 minutes of the friendly game last weekend. It’s been nearly two years since his last game, so you always have to be careful when a player’s been out for such a long time, but he’s progressing well.
 "Wes [Morgan] has rejoined the training group today. We have another 24 hours to assess them all. Ricardo is still a number of weeks away but he’s making good progress.”
 Amartey signed for Leicester from Danish side FC Copenhagen in January 2016, helping The Foxes win the Premier League title that season.

Apple is permitting these services to stream games to players, meaning they can host the game in cloud-connected servers and send videos of the gameplay back to users so that players can access games that they haven’t downloaded or play games that their phone or tablet hardware wouldn’t otherwise support. You could, for instance, play Red Dead Redemption 2 on Google Stadia on an iPhone or iPad. The advantage is that players could play games on mobile that would otherwise require a PC or a game console.

It’s hard to say whether this is good news as there are a lot of hoops to jump through, and the game-streaming companies have to decide if it is worth it to them. It’s not clear what happens if you have already paid for a subscription directly to Google and simply want to play a streamed game on your iPhone. It sounds like you would have to pay for that game over again, giving Apple its 30% cut.
