Yes. That first question is really insightful because we think, certainly, the secured funding strategy has been the right one for us to date. Again, we're inventing a business from scratch, and we're inventing the liability structures from scratch. It's a difficult task to ask the agencies on an unsecured basis to go first with no data and no real industry benchmarks to look at. So the secured financings have helped us start to create that benchmark dialogue. So they can see how private market participants are evaluating the risk to safety. I think the fact that we've gone through COVID with 100% rent payments is also a helpful fact. So certainly, part of our long-term plans would be to continue to think about unsecured as a great part of our liability strategy, but it was not really realistic coming out of the box. As time passes and certainly 3.5 years in, we certainly feel like that can be start that conversation as part of our dialogue with the agencies. Your second question was what again?

Washington County will extend its program to provide financial assistance for businesses in the county that have been negatively impacted through additional expenses or lost revenue due to closures during the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and extend assistance to hospitals and schools, and provide assistance to chambers of commerce and food shelves within Washington County.
 The Washington County Board of Commissioners approved the expansion of the county’s COVID-19 financial relief programs Oct. 20.
 The county received $31.7 million from the CARES Act/Coronavirus Relief Fund. More than half has been allocated to provide financial assistance to county residents and businesses. The county will use a portion of the funding to reimburse itself for expenditures made to manage the pandemic, and modifications made to county facilities to allow county business to continue safely.
 Using CARES funds, the County Board created a Small Business Relief Fund to provide grants of up to $15,000 to small businesses in need of support. There have been two rounds of applications; Tuesday’s action extends that program through Nov. 4. The county is also providing assistance to homeowners and renters who have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
 The program for the Small Business Relief Fund is being administered by the Community Development Agency (CDA). Recipients must be a locally owned and operated for-profit business in the county; Multiple individual businesses in the county that are owned by one owner are eligible to apply; to receive up to the maximum $15,000 funding limit, businesses must have at least one full-time equivalent employee, in addition to the owner as of March 1, and not more than 75, and generate less than $5 million in annual revenues; have been operating Jan. 1 and demonstrate a significant loss in revenue since March 15.

When Zendaya won last month’s Emmy Award for top drama series actress, her triumph seemed to underscore the TV industry’s progress toward inclusivity.
 The “Euphoria” star became the second Black winner in the category in five years, following Viola Davis’ drought-ending win for “How to Get Away with Murder” in 2015.
 But such success contrasts with the lag in diversity in behind-the-camera jobs and among TV executives regarding race and gender, according to a new University of California, Los Angeles, study released Thursday.
 “There has been a lot of progress for women and people of color in front of the camera,” Darnell Hunt, dean of the school’s social sciences division and the study’s co-author, said in a statement. “Unfortunately, there has not been the same level of progress behind the camera.”
 That’s most notable in Hollywood’s executive suites, where little has changed since the UCLA study tallied the numbers five years ago, he said.

The Melrose High School golf team is making the most of its 2020 season. This was a season that was in doubt due to COVID-19. No one knew if high school sports would be allowed this fall, especially considering Massachusetts shut down high school sports in the spring.
 But they're playing, and they're playing well. In fact, really well, and that's well, as in historical.
 Melrose is 7-0 entering the last stretch of the season. They have a rematch at home at Bellevue against Wilmington on Thursday, Oct. 22, a team they crushed earlier this week in North Reading.
 Melrose has Wakefield on the schedule for two matches next week, but those matches are in doubt, because Wakefield is coping with an uptick in COVID-19 cases and may have its season suspended.
 So if the Red Raiders wrap things up with a win against Wilmington on Thursday, and the Wakefield two-match series is canceled it will have its first undefeated season since the late 1980s, when a team coached by current 36-year mentor Rick McDermod went 9-0. The following year, his Melrose team went 8-1, capping off a terrific 17-1 two-year run.
 That would be similar to the run by the Red Raiders throughout the past three seasons. They won league titles in 2018 and 2019, and are now finishing off a potential perfect season this fall. There are no official league champions in the Middlesex League this fall, nor is there a postseason (Melrose was a Division 2 state finalist last year), but let's just call it three league titles in a row, shall we?
 Ok, sure, Melrose is only playing Freedom Division matches this fall, two against each of its five divisional foes, and does not have the larger, Middlesex League Liberty Division teams on its schedule like Lexington, Reading, Woburn, Belmont, defending state champion Winchester and Arlington.
 The last two league champion Melrose teams had to go up against its Liberty Division counterparts.
 "We have a nice blend of kids, even looking ahead to next year," McDermod said. "It's been four terrific years, and the last three have been stellar. Even the year when those (seniors now) were freshmen we lost a lot of matches by one point or a point and a half as a result of a lucky bounce. At the end of season, our record wasn't that good, but we were right there. We've really built this team. This is our second year beating all the Freedom teams. These kids went about their business getting better, and last year they made it to the state finals. There was a determination to really step up their play."
 Everybody won against host Wilmington on Monday.
 Senior Quinn McCarthy at No. 1 had two birdies to remain undefeated. Senior Will Pierce at No. 2 won, and is also unbeaten.
 Senior Brendan Fennell shot an even par, and is undefeated alongside fellow football player and senior Charlie Haggerty after their season got postponed until February.
 "They are really contributing. They are great pickups," McDermod said of his football players now making noise on the links. "When their sport folded up, they came onto golf, but they're not just playing, they are impact payers. They have just been a delightful addition. I had been tipped off about them, and I went looking for Brenden, and he had already signed up. Charlie then came on. They are just two terrific young men. It was a lucky break for us."
 Patrick Cotter is an undefeated sophomore, who transferred over from the Northeast Voke in Wakefield. Brian Healey is a junior, who has been on the team since freshman year. Anthony DelGenio is 3-0, and is a senior who came over last year from Malden Catholic. Another veteran, Thomas Brodeur, is undefeated.
 Roddy McGillicuddy is a freshman alternate, who has looked promising. Andrew Izzy is a junior rookie, who has a couple of wins.
 Brodeur's father Nate was on that last McDermod team to go undefeated in the late 1980s. He was also a state individual finalist back then.

The median selling price of a home also climbed to $311,800, up 15% from a year earlier, according to NAR. This is largely because of low inventory of existing homes. Housing inventory fell to only 2.7 months of home inventory on the market. That's a record low for that metric since NAR started tracking that data in 1982. Homes are moving off the market quickly as well, due to the lack of inventory, with a median home on the market only 21 days.

Yes. I think the hotel industry is definitely right in the line of fire here. We have seen some recovery in a number of the sectors, but I think this is still a long road back for many hospitality assets. Our largest asset is in Hawaii, which is tourism-dependent. Hawaii has been for the most part, in lockdown mode, full quarantine mode. They've recently relaxed that a little bit. We've talked to other major owners on the other islands in Hawaii. I think everybody remains optimistic that this is a temporal issue and that the long-term values of what Hawaii has always offered as a hospitality market will continue to be -- come back with a vengeance when this COVID impact is eliminated. So everybody is -- so far, as you see from our rent payment that everybody is paying, waiting for that better day. And as Marcos said, we're safe enough in the capital stack that unless this was to go on for 5, 6, 7, eight years, I don't think people are going to throw in the towel based on 12-month operating results.

Sure. I mean, as we've said, this is a business we had to invent from scratch. So we've enjoyed being the front-runner with really very little competition. I think as we've showed people the power of the concept, why it is radically different than what a lot of people used to think about the ground lease industry. We certainly expect copycats to show up. But what I'd tell you, Stephen, there hasn't been a lot of transaction activity. So we don't expect to see that competition still until there's a little bit more recovery in the market activity. So right now, we feel really good about the pipeline we're building, but it's not like there's billions of dollars of transactions lying around. We're having to fight for each one. So I think there's still a period of time here where we'll see competition for sure. And somebody is going to try to copycat us here, but we've learned a lot in 3.5 years that is not so easy to learn on your own. And we keep a few secrets to ourselves. So we'll keep pressing ahead. Again, the more efficient we get, the more we can provide benefits to our customers, including driving price. That should keep us in the clear lead, no matter who shows up.

During Northwood's scheduled outage, the mill's recovery boiler number one ("RB1") was assessed by Management to be in stable condition. Regarding the mill's recovery boiler number five ("RB5"), the previously announced capital upgrades to the upper furnace are ongoing and progressing well. In mid- October, Management made the decision to extend the outage on RB5 to enable the replacement of the lower furnace, in order to ensure the safe and reliable operation of the boiler. The estimated capital cost of the lower furnace upgrade is $30 million, with the work anticipated to take between 70-80 days during the fourth quarter on one production line, which will reduce NBSK pulp production by 60,000 to 70,000 tonnes. This lower furnace replacement, in conjunction with the upper furnace upgrades, is projected to ensure RB5's continued operation for another 15 to 20 years. In light of the assessments made by Management with regards to RB1 and RB5, the previously considered option of a new "super" recovery boiler ("RB6"), at an estimated cost of $400 million, will now not be required.

The Seattle Seahawks are one of just three unbeaten teams remaining in the NFL.


  None of their victories came against a team in the tough NFC West, however.


  The Seahawks, whose 5-0 start is the best in franchise history, will open division play Sunday when they travel to Arizona. The Cardinals (4-2) are above .500 this late in the season for the first time since 2015, which was the last time they made the playoffs.


  The Seahawks had a bye last week while the Cardinals come into the game on short rest following a 38-10 victory at Dallas on Monday night. The game will mark the second consecutive prime-time game for the Cardinals. The NFL on Thursday moved the game in Glendale, Arizona, to Sunday Night Football after an outbreak of COVID-19 on the Las Vegas Raiders, who were originally scheduled to play Tampa Bay in prime time.


  Seattle coach Pete Carroll said his team might have had its most productive bye week during his decade-long tenure.


  "It just seemed more connected than normal," Carroll said after players were forced to remain in the Seattle area for daily COVID-19 screenings. "I don't remember going on the practice field after a bye with the guys all fired up like they were.


  "We were just out there just as a regular 'Bonus Monday' for us and get back in action, start moving around. And they're all out there standing in line ready for us to stretch them out over five minutes early. ... It was a really good response to coming out of this thing."


  Three of Seattle's victories have come down to the final 15 seconds. In a 27-26 win against the visiting Minnesota Vikings in Week 5, Russell Wilson engineered a 94-yard drive in the final two minutes, throwing a 6-yard touchdown pass to DK Metcalf on fourth-and-goal.


  Wilson is widely considered the front-runner for the NFL's MVP award a third of the way through the season. He leads the league with 19 touchdown passes and a 129.8 quarterback rating.


  Cardinals second-year quarterback Kyler Murray completed just 9 of 24 attempts against the Cowboys but two went for touchdowns, including an 80-yarder to Christian Kirk that gave Arizona a 21-0 lead. Murray also rushed for 74 yards and a TD.


  "It wasn't as good as it should have been," Murray said. "Wasn't as accurate as I should have been. Wasn't up to par for my standards, so I've got to be better."


  Murray and DeAndre Hopkins are already in sync during their first year together -- even though the television cameras showed friction between the two on Monday. The veteran wide receiver leads the NFL in receptions (47) and receiving yards (601).


  "When those situations arise, I know how to deal with it," Murray said. "I understand and he understands. There are never any hard feelings. It's all love at the end of the day.


  "That's my guy. If yelling and fighting happens, it happens. At the end of the day, we're on the same team. It's just a thing you see on the football field. We're trying to be great."


  Arizona pounded out 261 rushing yards against Dallas, with Kenyan Drake running for 164 and two touchdowns, including a late 69-yard score.


  The Cardinals' defense, which gave up the most total yards in the league last season, forced four turnovers against Dallas, and safety Budda Baker was named the NFC's Defensive Player of the Week. That was without All-Pro pass rusher Chandler Jones, who is out for the season due to a torn biceps.


  "They played great," Murray said of the defense. "Great's not even the word. I don't even have a word for it."


  The Seahawks hoped to have All-Pro safety Jamal Adams back following the bye after he sat out the previous two games with a groin injury, but he has missed practice time this week. Fellow safety Lano Hill (back) was placed on injured reserve and veteran Demarious Randall was promoted from the practice squad.

For all its energy of renewal, Springsteen himself was in a mournful place when he began writing “Letter to You,” much of which he’s said tumbled out of him as he pondered the 2018 death of his old friend George Theiss, with whom he formed his first band, the Castiles. “Last Man Standing” pays specific tribute to Theiss in his “snakeskin vest and a sharkskin suit / Cuban heels on your boots”; the song recalls sweaty teenage gigs at the “black-leather clubs all along Route 9.”


  Theiss’ death made Springsteen the only surviving member of the Castiles, which got him thinking about music and about mortality; neither is a rare topic for Springsteen, who’s spent the last couple of decades alternating still-revved E Street tours with wizened acoustic solo stuff.


  But he’s unusually focused on the subjects this time. “House of a Thousand Guitars” describes a concert as a place to “tally my wounds and count the scars”; “The Power of Prayer” depicts a bar where “‘This Magic Moment’ drifts across the floor / As Ben E. King’s voice fills the air.”


  In “Ghosts” he again addresses a departed bandmate whose guitar is “coming in from the mystic far,” telling him, “I’m alive and I’m out here on my own / I’m alive and I’m coming home.” And he ends the album with one more journey to the other side in the shimmering “I’ll See You in My Dreams.”

  OTTAWA, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has a window for a snap election that could give him a majority government and free him of his dependence on opposition parties to govern - if only they would cooperate and withdraw their support.


  On Wednesday Trudeau's Liberals, doing well in polls due to their handling of the coronavirus pandemic, sought to capitalize on that boost before an emerging second wave worsens and expensive financial aid programs begin to wind down.


  The government called a surprise confidence vote which, if lost, would have triggered a snap election. But the left-leaning opposition New Democrats backed Trudeau, allowing the government to survive.


  "I'm convinced that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was looking for a way to go to an election," New Democrats leader Jagmeet Singh told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp after the tense vote on Wednesday.


  "We're not going to let them go to an election just because it suits them," Singh said.


  Trudeau, who has been in power since 2015, lost the popular vote last year after struggling through an ethics scandal and the emergence of old pictures of him in blackface, leaving him with a minority government. That means Trudeau must negotiate all legislation to win opposition support. A majority government is independent.


  But his handling of COVID-19 has put wind in the Liberals' sails, and there is no way to predict how long it will last.


  "If we look at the 6-, 12-, 18-month horizon, there are an increasing number of uncertainties related to the state of the economy and what happens with the pandemic," said pollster Nik Nanos, founder of Nanos Research.


  "(Liberals) are starting to see a window that's open today and that they know will be open 60-90 days at the very least. Why try to extend the mandate when they can have a smash and grab majority?" Nanos said.


  The Liberals would win 38.5% of the vote today, according to Nanos Research, 6 points more than their main rivals, the Conservatives, which could be just enough to secure a majority.


  Getting there needs the New Democrats to stop backing the government, including the pre-Christmas fiscal update, which Liberals have said will include major spending plans.


  KINGMAKER


  The New Democrats have said they want to use their kingmaker position to force the Liberals to incorporate more social safety-net measures into the spending package. The party is also wary of an expensive election campaign.


  But this week, as it negotiated with the Liberals for its support to quash a Conservative motion that led to the confidence vote, it got no concessions. The Liberals abruptly cut off talks on Tuesday morning, an NDP source said.


  "It's hard to sit across the table and negotiate with somebody who wants to lose (the negotiation)," the source said.


  Trudeau has insisted he does not want an election. Instead, he wants to pass pandemic aid and the fiscal package to stimulate an economic recovery.


  "We don't want an election. We didn't want one yesterday. I don't think Canadians want one," a government source said on Thursday.


  Another government source said it is now up to the Liberals to illustrate they want to work with opposition parties, but if the parties want to "derail (the government's work), then we need a new mandate."


  Three provincial governments have sought early votes to capitalize on a bump in their popularity during the pandemic. One incumbent won and two more are expected to win over the next few days.


  Frank Graves, president of polling company EKOS Research, sees risks of a snap election this fall during the worsening second wave of the pandemic.


  "The dominant issue is the pandemic and we've reached a crisis stage. That factor could weigh heavily on how voters make their decisions," Graves said. "If you do (an election) in the spring ... the worst is behind us, and I think Trudeau would be in a strong position to win."

Gap joins other clothing retailers in trying to reinvent themselves during the COVID-19 pandemic. The outbreak forced many non- essential stores to temporarily close in the spring and early summer.

The coordinating partners of the Parks and Trails Legacy Plan, which include the Metropolitan Council, the Greater Minnesota Regional Parks and Trails Commission, and the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, are seeking applicants to serve on the Parks and Trails Legacy Advisory Committee.
 The committee champions the 25-year Parks and Trails Legacy Plan by making recommendations that aim to connect more people to the outdoors and help enhance and improve its outdoor recreation opportunities across Minnesota.
 Since its inception in 2012, the committee has improved collaboration among partners, provided guidance on the implementation of the Legacy Plan, and communicated with the public through state and regional events to ensure all Minnesotans are aware of opportunities to enjoy the state’s beautiful outdoors.
 “The committee plays a critical role in helping to achieve the vision Minnesotans have for use of the Parks and Trails Legacy Fund,” said May Yang, chairwoman, Parks and Trails Legacy Advisory Committee.
 Eight seats on the 17-member committee are open for applications. The deadline for applications is Nov. 21. Among the desired expertise and perspectives for prospective committee members are backgrounds in youth programs, natural resource and outdoor skills building education, resource management, marketing, new technology, tourism, and business.
 Terms are two years; members can serve a maximum of three terms. The committee typically meets every two months at locations throughout the state, with an option to attend remotely.
 Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the committee is currently holding remote meetings only. Meetings have historically included tours of state and regional parks and trails and provided members with opportunities to learn onsite and in-person about projects and programs supported by the Parks and Trails Legacy Fund.
 Interested individuals should complete the application form online on the Parks and Trails Legacy Advisory Committee membership application page or print it out and return it to Gratia Joice, Department of Natural Resources, Box 39, 500 Lafayette Road, St. Paul, MN 55155.

Adds details, background)

  WASHINGTON, Oct 22 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump and his intelligence chief have pushed for quick declassification of a document disputing the 2017 intelligence community finding that Russia acted to help Trump get elected in 2016, three U.S. government officials familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday.


  But their effort faces strong objections from inside the intelligence agencies, two officials said on condition of anonymity given the sensitivity of the matter. One reason for their opposition is the proximity of the Nov. 3 election.


  An Oct. 15 letter written by Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe to the inspector general for the intelligence community, reviewed by Reuters, confirmed he was seeking the declassification of the document at the request of Devin Nunes, the senior Republican on the House Intelligence Committee.


  "I have requested that the document undergo a formal declassification review in response to a request" from Nunes, Ratcliffe wrote, noting that Republicans on the committee first requested that it be declassified in December 2018 when they controlled the House.


  A former U.S. intelligence official familiar with the issue said that the CIA and the National Security Agency - which monitors worldwide communications - were trying to stop Ratcliffe from releasing the document "because it would damage national security assets and jeopardize sources and methods."


  Ratcliffe and others had been pushing to have the intelligence declassified by Thursday night, one of the officials said. If successful, that would allow its release around the time that Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden square off in their final debate.


  Declassification by Thursday night was highly unlikely, according to a fourth official.


  The White House, the Department of Justice and the CIA did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The National Security Agency declined to comment.


  Ratcliffe, a former Republican congressman who defended Trump against his impeachment by the House of Representatives last year, promised in his confirmation hearings that he would be "apolitical" as the coordinator of all the U.S. intelligence agencies.


  Democrats and some former senior U.S. intelligence officials have since accused Ratcliffe of politicizing intelligence by selectively declassifying materials that favor the president as Trump wages a tough fight for re- election.


  It would not be the first time that Ratcliffe has declassified material that questioned the 2017 intelligence community assessment over the objections of U.S. intelligence agencies.


  Last month, he released to Senate Republicans unverified Russian intelligence that may have been fabricated. That material contradicted the 2017 assessment and the bipartisan findings of a Senate Intelligence Committee investigation that Russia used hacking and other means in a bid to sway the 2016 election to Trump over Democrat Hillary Clinton.


  On Wednesday night, Ratcliffe called a hastily arranged news conference to say that Russia and Iran have both tried to interfere with the 2020 presidential election, drawing swift denials from Moscow and Tehran. He said Iran's efforts were aimed at damaging Trump.


  The document he is working with now is believed to be two or three years old and was originated in Congress by Republicans who support Trump's assertion that Russians did not intervene to help him defeat Clinton, one of the officials said.


  Russian President Vladimir Putin has also denied that his government helped Trump, a stance that Trump accepted in front of Putin when they met in Helsinki in 2018, putting him at odds with the findings of his intelligence agencies.

The newly-formed BitTorrent X ecosystem will contain storage through BitTorrent File System, distribution through BitTorrent, and streaming through DLive. The company hopes that this will help in “establishing a truly decentralized internet” by driving “blockchain-related tools to billions of devices.” With the current streaming landscape fragmented among several major platforms, we’re sure DLive — with new ownership to boot — will be looking to step up, especially after the collapse of Mixer. More information on the newly-formed BitTorrent X is slated to be unveiled during a live event in November.

The ratio change here doesn't actually change anything about TuanChe, and investors shouldn't take too positive a view of the massive price advance. In fact, second-quarter results, released in mid-September, were terrible, with revenues off by 73% year over year. That's not surprising given the impact of COVID-19, but it is really far more telling about the company's business than today's technically driven price change. That said, the business headwinds that TuanChe is facing today might help explain why what should have been viewed as a 1 for 4 reverse split only led to a 100% share-price gain. When all is said and done, that could actually be the more important takeaway from today's action for long-term investors.

When I said kind of, this -- it's a good question. I look through that and I think you have to look at things on a year-to-date basis and move things out and then ask the question. So year-to-date the U.S. residential market, our business is up 8% and as virtually no price in that. So that's simply machines breaking the same number. We're going to break, no matter what is going on in the economy or COVID machine don't know. So you have an 8% growth rate, largely driven by a healthy replacement market, contractor confidence to go and install the right thing or upgrade the right thing and get the work done. And that type of growth rate is above average, but not so far out and -- out of the space that it doesn't seem sustainable, because again I think homeowner, contractor, distributor, even OEM is feeling this kind of health in the market. And if we stay at home, added something time, but I think in big picture 8% sustaining itself is not out of the question or out of the ordinary and some of the short-term choppiness you need to look through it I think.

During the scheduled outage at CPPI's Northwood NBSK pulp mill ("Northwood"), the mill's recovery boiler number one ("RB1") was assessed by Management to be in stable condition. Regarding the mill's recovery boiler number five ("RB5"), the previously announced capital upgrades to the upper furnace are ongoing and progressing well. In mid-October, Management made the decision to extend the outage on RB5 to enable the replacement of the lower furnace, in order to ensure the safe and reliable operation of the boiler. The estimated capital cost of the lower furnace upgrade is $30 million, with the work anticipated to take between 70-80 days during the fourth quarter on one production line, which will reduce NBSK pulp production by 60,000 to 70,000 tonnes. This lower furnace replacement, in conjunction with the upper furnace upgrades, is projected to ensure RB5's continued operation for another 15 to 20 years. In light of the assessments made by Management with regards to RB1 and RB5, the previously considered option of a new "super" recovery boiler ("RB6"), at an estimated cost of $400 million, will now not be required.

The CBD itself comes from local producer Half Day, and it has a mild flavor profile, Gabriel said, making it ideal for infusing a variety of different dishes with different flavors. The Ayalas said last year that they were intrigued by the long-term possibilities of cooking with CBD.


  “We don’t really think it’s a fad,” Gabriel said. “We think that’s only going to expand people’s minds to different alternatives in food and eating, so we just want to jump on that bandwagon before it’s all built.”


  The Half Day tinctures will also be for sale at Wake ’N Bacon’s retail counter.


  The grand opening will begin at 7 a.m. Thursday. If you’re around, the restaurant also boasts a pretty cool fixture: a full-length mirror that’s essentially a nonenclosed photo booth that’s perfect for souvenirs or posting to the ’Gram.
