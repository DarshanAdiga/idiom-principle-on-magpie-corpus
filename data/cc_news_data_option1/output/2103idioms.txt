“It will take about 70 months to break even on the cost of the new equipment. Based on the information received from the proposed equipment manufacturer, this equipment will reduce the number of cardboard loads hauled to Hall County by a factor of up to 20 to one. Also, the material will be sorted as it is put into the compactor which will result in clean materials which will generate revenue for the county,” he said.

Lili (right) and her daughter Madeline on the day of their half marathon runCourtesy Lili Wright
 Sunlight dapples the trees as we set off to the soundtrack of “Wooo!!” Such peace. Empty roads in the new light of morning. The steady plod of our sneakers in sync. I do not miss the _real_ Mini-Marathon with rocks bands and Batman, snack tables and potties. Our humble version fits the zeitgeist. One of the rare pleasures of this crazy, miserable pandemic is the chance to spend time with Madeline, to attempt the impossible, together.
 Mile two, three, four, I am beset by technical difficulties. I wore too many clothes and must stop to disrobe, which throws off Spotify and Run Tracker and my earphones stop working, forcing me to run without Bruno Mars, a man no woman should be without. Walmart appears. Then, the soccer fields. I feel like a turd on the side of the road.
 To summon strength, I remember Jennifer.
 Her sister died a few years after her brother in the same hospice. When someone passes, the staff shifts the butterfly that hangs on each bedroom door, a symbol the patient has flown off, soared. On race days, Jennifer wears butterfly earrings and a necklace with two butterflies to honor her siblings. “When I start feeling I want to quit, I touch my earlobes or the pendant and it’s my reminder: _Who the hell am I to say this is hard?_ I watched my brother die in agony when cancer spread from his esophagus to the lining of his brain and lungs to the degree it almost forced an eye out of his socket. _And I think this is tough? It’s not tough. This is easy._ I need to get over myself, kick it into another gear, dig deep, and fight for what I want. I am on this earth. I can do this if I want to.”
 I wonder if the same holds true for me.
 Peter agrees to meet us at mile five with water and snacks. The promise of sugar keeps me going, but when we reach the park, no Peter. He is behind schedule with his weekly shop at Walmart.
 I groan something unprintable.
 We lap the fields. My head soars over the maples like a lost balloon. Lap two, Peter finally drives up in his Toyota and offers us blue gummies. We drink. We chew. With a kiss for each of us, he wishes us courage and strength and promises to be at the finish line. I am so very grateful.
 On the second lap, mile-seven euphoria buoys me. I sprint past Madeline, though she soon catches up. Walmart winds blow us, but we do not break. Madeline’s legs hurt. She massages her hip. Mile eight. Mile nine. On dreaded high school hill, we flatten the curve. Dogwoods blossom. Dandelions toss back their heads. Before us, our yellow house, where a chair, a bed, and chocolate ice cream await. With two miles remaining, we settle for water.
 “We need to add a little distance to reach 13.1,” Madeline says, checking her phone. “Let’s circle East College.”
 My toes burn with blisters. My hamstrings ping like cello strings. But add on we do, circling DePauw’s empty campus. I whimper. Madeline beams. She is beautiful, confident. “We’re so close!” she cheers. And we are. On Wooo!!, Alexander Hamilton vows to not throw away his shot.
 The final miles, we ride gravity downhill. We have been running for more than two hours. Peter films our arrival. Lincoln smiles under his cap. Who needs the support of 30,0000 runners? We have two precious fans. Am I running? Barely. Picture an empty beer can bobbing off the bumper of a newlywed’s limo. We cross the finish line a tenth of a mile short and so have to keep going, pivot, cross the line a second time, victory arms high. We beam, hug, pose for photos, stagger into the car in our damp sports bras. High. Gonzo. Incredulous. Done.

The USPS remains a critical part of our country's communication, supply and security infrastructure. Our mission is to bind the nation together by providing reliable, affordable and universal service to all Americans. The post office pre-dates the founding of our nation, and our Founders considered postal services so essential that they enshrined it in the Constitution.


   


  We deliver more than 140 billion pieces of mail to 160 million addresses six and sometimes seven days a week. We deliver medication, checks, ballots, personal and business communications, and online goods and merchandise. We perform this indispensable service in good times and bad, through natural disasters and national emergencies, and yes, during pandemics.


   


  Businesses large and small rely on our affordable rates and we remain a lifeline to rural communities and seniors.


   


  The USPS has not received taxpayer funding in 40 years, but the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a sharp drop in business mail and revenue, despite delivering more parcels. Without funding, the post office may soon run out of money. Some suggest that reductions in service, drastic rate hikes or privatization are the solution. This would be a terrible mistake.


   


  Diminishing the Service would devastate the $1.6 trillion national mailing industry, which employs 7 million Americans in the private sector, including 80,000 Kansans. The USPS itself employs 630,000 workers, 100,000 of whom are military veterans.


   


  Please let our elected representatives know of the need to protect and strengthen the USPS now and for the decades to come. The women and men of the USPS have always been there for our country; now we need our country to be there for us.

Earlier this week, the Stevens County Sheriff's Office posted a heartbreaking story about a 23-year-old woman killed in a car crash. The Sheriff's Office noted that in the backseat at the time of the crash was a 6-month-old baby in a car seat. The baby survived the crash thanks to a properly secured rear- facing car seat.
 It is absolutely worth noting that an on-duty UPS driver came upon the crash and was able to cut the child out of the car and take them to a location that had cell service so medical helicopter could transport the child to Spokane for precautionary treatment. The child was expected to be released from the hospital. Had that baby not been properly secure, the crash could've become even more tragic than it already was.
 My heart goes out to that family for their loss, that young baby, and the UPS driver who heroically stepped in.
 The story hits close to home for me. I have a 3-year-old boy and 9-month-old twin boys. I drive them all around regularly in my pickup and up until I read that tragic story out of Stevens County, believed that I had their car seats installed correctly.
 The weeks prior to the birth of a child are hectic, as any parent can tell you. There's a lot to do, including installing car seats so that you're ready to take your new bundle (or bundles, in my case) of joy home. And I read the manuals, I installed the seats, but did I do it correctly? The safety of my children is paramount and I wanted to know if I had done all I could by installing their car seats correctly.
 For the answer, I turned to the Spokane Police Department's resident car seat safety expert: Sgt. Teresa Fuller.
 As a Certified Car Seat Technician, Sgt. Fuller has been checking car seats for parents and grandparents in the Spokane area for roughly 16 years. She became involved in car seat safety after taking a course early in her career and finding her own son's seat wasn't properly installed.
 "Had we been in a significant enough crash, it would've caused a lot of injury to him, maybe even killed him," Sgt. Fuller told me on Friday. "That to me was a big eye opener. if I'm getting it wrong as a police officer and a relatively well educated person, how many other parents are getting it wrong?"
 The answer to that question shocked me. Sgt. Fuller said 80-90 percent of car seats checked in Spokane are installed incorrectly for "catastrophic misuse".
 I like to fancy myself smarter than your average bear, but bears don't know how to properly install car seats and as it turns out, I don't either.
 "I think I have them installed correctly, but I feel like you're about to pick it apart" I timidly told Sgt. Fuller.
 "We'll see," she chuckled.

There are still several virus hot spots around the world causing concern, said a top World Health Organization official on CNN’s Global Town Hall earlier tonight. The WHO is keeping a close eye on very large increases in case numbers in Russia, Africa, the Americas, some countries in South Asia and a few countries in Europe, said Maria Van Kerkhove, technical lead for the WHO’s coronavirus response. She said she hopes a vaccine could be deployable by the end of the year -- but that’s if everything goes right. Scientists are working around the clock on more than 100 vaccine candidates, she said, but the accelerated schedule cannot compromise on safety or efficacy.

Boeing is cutting more than 12,000 U.S. jobs through layoffs and buyouts as the coronavirus pandemic seizes the travel industry. And the aircraft maker says more cuts are coming.
 Shortly after disclosing the job cuts, Boeing announced Wednesday that it has resumed production of the grounded 737 Max jetliner. Two deadly crashes of Max jets pushed Boeing into a financial crisis months before the coronavirus squeezed global air travel to a trickle.
 Boeing, one of the nation's biggest manufacturers, said it will lay off 6,770 U.S. employees this week, and another 5,520 workers are taking buyout offers to leave voluntarily in the coming weeks.

La situazione è più concitata all’interno del Partito popolare europeo. Il suo presidente, il polacco Donald Tusk, sta cercando di rilanciare quello che potrebbe essere un suo obiettivo politico personale: espellere tout-court Fidesz dal PPE. Tredici partiti nazionali hanno effettivamente chiesto a Tusk di votare l’espulsione degli ungheresi – ma con le ingombranti assenze dei membri del PPE di Germania, Italia, Spagna e Francia, il processo si preannuncia complesso, e di certo divisivo. La Romania ad esempio non ha voluto sottoscrivere l'appello, per scongiurare tensioni ai confini dei due paesi. La Slovenia non sembra interessata a calcare la mano, dove il Premier Janša pare non avere particolari problemi con i metodi Orbán. La Croazia invece, che è di turno alla presidenza del Consiglio dell'Unione europea fino alla fine di giugno, non ha unito la sua voce a quanti chiedono di prendere provvedimenti a causa del declino dello stato di diritto Ungherese, attirando a sé diverse critiche. Al contempo Orbán ha chiesto sostegno ai suoi alleati in Europa, dichiarando sprezzantemente che ”non ha tempo per queste fantasie”.
