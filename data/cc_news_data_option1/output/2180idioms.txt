The week was ending, and here Savage was uniting all of the week’s disparate threads into a tapestry of resentment. He talked about Twitter, which is “controlled by a psychopath who edits and modifies everything on my Twitter feed.” He suggested that the Floyd protests were influenced by residual anger over the COVID-19 lockdowns. He raged against “a demonic media that needs to be curtailed the way Lincoln curtailed the media during the Civil War.” He read an ad for a mask retailer, urging listeners to use the code SAVAGE20 and save money at checkout, and then later proceeded to announce that “masks don’t work.” He called Elon Musk “Elton Musk,” which made me laugh very hard.

Around the world, there are 365 days in a year. Yet in China, one of those days is purposely forgotten each year. In Taiwan, there were once days missing from our calendar, but we've worked to bring them to light. I hope one day China can say the same.

Also, you're more likely to need optics on the MP5 because of the increased recoil and more restrictive iron sights. However, given the size of the Verdansk map, optics on the MP7 could help you hit your shots too.


  ## Which one should you use? MP7 or MP5


  Finally, we're going to give you our recommendations for which you should use, as well as when you should use it. The MP7 is more of an AR/SMG hybrid thanks to it's larger magazine size and more manageable recoil.

  While its damage range does fall off at longer ranges, the FSS Recon and Monolithic Suppressor will give you enough fire power to hold your own at medium ranges. The MP5, on the other hand, is far better up close and personal, but will struggle at medium to longer ranges.


  So your choice will come down to how you intend to play and what other weapons you have. If you're going to use a sniper rifle as your second weapon, we'd recommend the MP7 as it is generally more versatile. If your secondary weapon is an AR, however, we'd recommend going for a MP5 to give you more power up close.

Thousands gathered on Sunday, but what they demonstrated was their willingness to obey all the rules, to not step out of line. Evidently property is sacred, life is not. Action, resistance is needed!

New Delhi The Centre is committed to restarting industries and reviving the economy, the central government's top law officer, attorney general (AG) KK Venugopal, told the Supreme Court on Thursday during the hearing of a case challenging the home ministry's March 29 directive to employers to pay workers in full for the lockdown period.The directive had been  intended to alleviate human suffering and will not come in the way of employers and employees negotiating the payment terms, the AG said."Government of India is interested in economy restarting, industries restarting. It is for employers to negotiate with employees as to how much wage could be paid for lockdown period, we will not interfere," Venugopal said.Industries, traders and their associations, which are the petitioners before the apex court in the case, countered by arguing that workers will not come to the negotiating table as long as the government notification mandating payment of full wages is in operation."With the March 29 notification in place, no negotiation will be possible since workers will not come to negotiating table. We are as much citizens as the workers are", senior counsel KV Viswanathan, who was appearing for the company B4S Solution Ltd, told the bench headed by justice Ashok Bhushan.The bench also seemed to share the concerns of the employers, stating that mandating payment of full wages during the lockdown could have an adverse impact on the industries."The notification directs payment of 100% of salaries. It could have been around 50 to 75%. Do you have the power to ask them to pay 100%," justice Bhushan asked.The bench, which also comprised justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and MR Shah, reserved its verdict, which will be delivered on June 12. The court also granted interim protection to employers directing that no coercive action be taken against them until the court delivers its verdict."List for orders on June 12. In the meantime, no coercive action, against the employers shall be taken pursuant to notification dated March 29," the order said.The contentious notification issued by the ministry of home affairs on March 29 stated that employers must pay wages in full to all their employees even if their establishments are closed because of the lockdown."All the employers, be it in the industry or in the shops and commercial establishment, shall make payment of wages of their workers, at their work places on due date, without any deduction for the period their establishments are under closure during the lockdown", clause (iii) of the MHA order said.Companies and associations approached the Supreme Court ,stating that the obligation to pay employees arises only when work is actually done."An employer and employee have reciprocal promises whereby the right of an employee to demand salary is reciprocal to performance of work by such employee. The employer has a right to not pay if no work is done", the plea by Hand Tool Manufacturers Association, an association of around 52 firms based out of Punjab, said.The AG told the bench that the directive was to ensure that workers in industries stayed put instead of migrating to their home towns/ villages during the lockdown. "The humanitarian grounds on which this order was issued should be considered. People were migrating in crores. They would have stayed put only if they were paid", he said in defence of the government notification.Senior counsel Indira Jaising, who appeared for Angmenhanti Kashtakari Sangarsh Samiti, an umbrella coalition of informal workers, also supported the government directive, arguing that it was intended to protect workers who had been prevented from going to work by the authorities because of the pandemic."If an authority prevents me from going to work, then that authority should ensure that I am protected. We have honoured the lockdown", she said.

She says, “If you are not into going to a training and talking to other people, black people can see you don’t know from 5,000 miles away.” The city “can put stuff in place, but black folks won’t come because you are faking the funk.”

A third of the 32,594 non-functional industrial units in Punjab are unable to restart manufacturing due to a shortage of raw material and labour.


  Of the total 2.59 lakh registered industrial units in the state, 2.27 lakh, or say 87%, have commenced their operations after the coronavirus-induced restrictions were eased during the lockdown 4.0 about three weeks ago. The remaining factories are still in lockdown and grappling with non-availability of raw material, shortage of working hands, working capital crunch, and slump in demand for finished products, revealed a survey carried out by the state industries department.


  About half of these non-functional units - to be precise, 15,598 - are in the state's industrial hub of Ludhiana. As per the data collected by the department through the district industry centres, the non-availability of raw material is the primary reason for the inability of 5,637 industrial units to resume production and 5,288 are facing labour shortage as a large number of migrant workers have returned home.


  Another 4,548 and 3,587 factories have been held back by the poor demand for their products and finance problems, respectively, whereas 4,427 units are located in containment areas where activities are still not allowed. The industries department has not received information from districts Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar (earlier known as Nawanshahr), Barnala, Gurdaspur, Sangrur, and Pathankot.


   


   


  Industries director Sibin C said some industrial units were having issues related to raw material, labour and finance and are still not able to resume operations, but things would stabilise soon. "The shortage of labour will end sooner than later as passenger trains have resumed. The raw material movement from some parts of the country and abroad remains a matter of concern for some sectors, though," he said, citing the examples of textiles and bicycle sectors, which source their raw material from China.


  Sibin said the department would also set up a helpdesk at the state headquarters to facilitate industrial units get funds from the ₹20,000-crore subordinate debt announced by the centre for stressed micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) for which the guidelines were awaited. But this is half the story. The industries, which have resumed production, are also no less worried due to rising cost and demand slump. Badish Jindal, president of Federation of Punjab Small Industries Association said power and labour costs had gone up as units were operating less than 50% capacity.


  "Migrant workers are demanding more money and two-part power tariff means we have to have to shell out a lot more for per unit of electricity consumed due to high fixed charges and low consumption. Another problem is delayed payments," he said. The industry associations requested industries minister Sunder Sham Arora, who was in Ludhiana on Thursday, to do away with fixed charges for electricity to industrial consumers for the time being.


  PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PHDCCI) chairman, Punjab, Karan Gilhotra had also last week termed labour shortage, disruption in supply chain and decline in demand as a serious challenge for the state industry. The factories were shut down after curfew was imposed in the state on March 23. Though the central and state governments later allowed industries, only 7% restarted operations till March 16 but there has been a spurt in their number since.

"This is the fourth iteration of guidance from FDA and the agency continues to move the goalposts," Cooper said. "It is good to have finally some specific impurity limits. because we were kind of flying blind before, but we're concerned that this new guidance is not going to do anything to alleviate the shortage of hand sanitizer because those limits remain too restrictive for most us ethanol producers to meet."

Many java connoisseurs find espresso to be the ultimate expression of coffee, but the difference between a truly great brew and one that's just so-so comes down to finding the best espresso machine in your price range. It's easy to fall hard for espresso, which is concentrated, complex and intensely flavorful. But to be your own top-level barista and create and enjoy good coffee drinks at home, you'll need to be willing to spend big bucks for an espresso maker.


  The best home espresso machines have an advanced brewing process and handy bells and whistles like a double portafilter basket for double shot drinks and a milk frother and steam wand for a cup of cappuccino or a latte. These automatic machines don't come cheap, and you can expect to pay at least $600 for something that whips up legit cafe-caliber espresso drinks (or an espresso shot, if that's your thing). But when in doubt, try to remember how much you'll be saving on all the lattes, cappuccinos and double shots you get from your coffee shop thanks to your espresso and cappuccino maker.


  Of course, you _can_ also drop as little as $100, if you're willing to settle for a mediocre espresso, but I urge you not to pounce on products that cost less, especially if you plan on drinking espresso regularly. TA seemingly affordable espresso machine may look like a bargain at first blush, but they're often a waste of money and counter space, too.


  For those on a budget, "espresso brewers" (in the $30 to $50 price range) typically lack motorized pumps and are powered by steam pressure alone. What they produce is really moka pot, the sort of coffee made by simple stovetop brewers; it won't taste quite like the espresso you're used to from the barista at your local coffee shop or cafe. That's not inherently bad -- it's just not really espresso.

Risponde - spiegano i curatori dell'iniziativa - all'esigenza di confrontarsi con figure professionali e specialisti che non sempre vengono consultati, o spesso limitati a visite periodiche. Non è raro che il paziente, accompagnato da familiari, provi inoltre imbarazzo a rivolgere domande considerate "poco opportune", che invece meritano attenzione e necessitano di risposte puntuali. SMAspace vuole essere dunque quel luogo virtuale dove accorciare le distanze tra paziente e medico, consentendo di fare anche domande in anonimato tramite la piattaforma. Aperto a tutti, ma principalmente rivolto alle persone con SMA e le loro famiglie, prevede la richiesta di partecipazione tramite la mail accrediti@osservatoriomalattierare.it (oggetto: "Richiesta partecipazione SMAspace 5 giugno").

A 4-3 loss to Minnesota in Sutherland’s debut brought the Jets to the brink of tying the longest winless streak in NHL history – 27, set by the 1975-76 Kansas City Scouts. To avoid such a fate, they would have to beat the defending Stanley Cup Champion New York Islanders, and with Mike Bossy notching a hat trick on the night, it just wasn’t going to happen. The Jets fell 5-4, and set a new record two nights later when they were hammered by the same Islanders in New York to the tune of 6-2.

O'Neill, indeed, seemed certain to sign him on transfer deadline day in January, only for Bruno Martins Indi's exit to stall and all bets called off.


  The manager explained the following week: “It was an option. We had explored the potential of bringing Chris in.


  “It was more on the basis of potentially Bruno going out, to be honest, and when that deal didn’t materialise, we felt that we would be one player too many in that situation. That’s the nature of the transfer window."


  Brunt has written a personal message to West Brom supporters to say goodbye, hoping he can sign off by sealing a third promotion to the Premier League.


  He has nine games remaining but they will be played out behind closed doors.

En Corrientes, en la época de la guerra de la Triple Alianza, de la peste amarilla y de disputas armadas entre gauchos desertores y paisanos dispuestos a la lucha sin cuartel se destacó Antonio Mamerto Gil Núñez quien, desde su juventud, necesitó enfrentarse a las injusticias sociales y a la ley establecida por los militares. Este hombre solitario y siempre dispuesto a tender su mano a los necesitados vuelve de esa guerra en la que la Argentina, Brasil y Uruguay se enfrentaron al pueblo paraguayo y lo hace con el deseo de asentarse en sus pagos de Mercedes, pero la violencia vuelve a llamar a su puerta. Bautizado "Gauchito" Gil por quienes lo consideran un cálido sanador de niños y de mujeres, este hombre de honda ternura se convierte en un perseguido por el Estado, quienes ven en él a un peligroso enemigo.

There is an ongoing investigation into a shooting that was reported in Poplar Bluff on Tuesday. The Poplar Bluff Police Department says the shooting occurred in the 1000 block of North 11th Street, where a 55-year-old man was shot in the arm while standing on a porch. He was transported to a Poplar Bluff hospital for treatment, before being flown to another hospital. Several bullet casings were on a nearby vehicle, and several were found on the house the victim was standing under. No suspect has been identified, and the investigation is currently ongoing. If you have any information on the shooting, you are asked to contact the Police Department by calling 573-785-5776.

There are several observations that the comrades noted about the march and the violent repression it faced at the end of the evening. All along the march route, the most prominent forms of damage that were noted was simply some graffiti tagging. Most commonly these tags said “BLM”, “FTP”, “ACAB”, “FUCK 12”, “FUCK KKKOPS”, etc. However, there were several tags of a more revolutionary character such as “Fuck Profit,” “The Guillotines are Coming,” “Amerikkka must pay for its crimes against black lives,” and others. Hammer- and-sickles and the anarchist Circle A were often tagged too. While the most direct outlet of the anger was targeted specifically at the police and the racial injustice wrought against black and brown Americans, there was a definite layer of inherent feeling that it isn’t just an issue of racist cops, but an issue of a deeply flawed and outdated capitalist system that law enforcement protects. This was shown most clearly at one of the most significant points of the march, where it was stopped on Rodeo Dr. in the absolute heart of Beverly Hills. The crowd spontaneously erupted into chants of “Eat The Rich”.

Taking cognizance of the petition filed by BJP MLA Ashish Shelar which raised concerns over an incident at Sion Hospital where Covid-19 infected patients were being treated next to the bodies of patients who had succumbed to the virus, the Bombay high court has directed the BMC and the state government to explain the process of handling and cremating bodies of those who have died due to the infectious disease.The division bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice A A Sayyed while hearing a clutch of public interest litigations filed by various individuals, organisations and politicos was informed by advocates Rajendra Pai and Ameet Mehta that several videos from the hospital wherein bodies of deceased Covid-19 victims kept on beds or on the floor adjacent to people taking treatment for coronavirus had emerged. He sought a direction to the government and BMC to immediately stop the practice of keeping bodies of Covid-19 infected victims in wards where people are being treated for the infection. Shelar's advocates further argued, "Retention of the bodies in active wards in Sion Hospital as recently reported is a matter of serious concern. It gives rise to medical as well as humanitarian issues. No civilized society can afford to repeatedly witness such incidents."In light of these submissions, Shelar sought directions to the authorities to initiate a probe into the incident and register cases against the hospital staff responsible for letting the bodies of the deceased remain in active wards and to follow procedure laid down by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and Central government for disposal of bodies of Covid-19 victims.After hearing the submissions, the court directed the state government and the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to respond with details about how bodies of Covid-19 victims were handled and disposed and posted the matter for hearing next week.

When the studio closed March 17 due to the COVID-19 crisis and state mandates, Trax began offering virtual classes. “Dee Gard and the staff adapted quickly to the online world,” Hajdukovich said. “It was a real bonus in a time of change.”


  But he was thrilled to see people on Saturday and get to teach a live class again. Inviting the goats just made it more fun, he said.


  Goat owner Jenney Hughes brought 11 kids (baby goats) and four adult animals to the yoga class.


  “It’s fun,” she said. “I get to share the fun with everyone.”


  Throughout the class, children scattered grain on yoga mats to attract the animals to interact with the people.


  Kirsten Dick had done goat yoga in Arizona and was willing to pay $20 to do it again. “It’s the best thing you could do,” she said. “Get outside and have some laughs.”


  Jabrai Trueluck said he attended because his wife signed up the whole family. “I like getting out and about, especially if it’s fitness,” he said.


  Lisa Wright Currie said she has been missing being able to practice yoga with others these past few months.


  “I’ll do anything to do yoga,” she said. “The goats make it more attractive than ever.”

It’s the time of the year when Supreme Court justices can get testy. They might have to find a new way to show it. The court’s most fought-over decisions in its most consequential cases often come in June, with dueling majority and dissenting opinions. But when a justice is truly steamed to be on a decision’s losing side, the strongest form of protest is reading a summary of the dissent aloud in court. Dissenting justices exercise what a pair of scholars call the “nuclear option” just a handful of times a year, but when they do, they signal that behind the scenes, there’s frustration and even anger.

We at Arcules approach the end-user relationship a little differently, staying in constant communication as a means to assess how our service is performing and allowing us to gather information about a customer's pain points - or more appropriately, risk points. We go as far as to host co-design sessions with our customers, encompassing a couple of days to truly focus on a specific problem and build on these concepts for a broader audience. The customer gets what feels like a custom solution. We are getting insights and validation at speed. These aren't new concepts, but in this industry that has trouble with velocity, we're finding that they are welcomed with open arms.

Dorkatron starts things off with one of the catchiest songs on the record, “Robotic Love”. This was my first time hearing both bands, so I was happy that it caught my attention immediately. But truthfully, any of the songs on this record would have grabbed my curiosity just as quickly. The band plays around with the nerd rock image, as evidenced in their promo shots, the song titles and lyrics , and even the album art (a pretty clever combination of both band names). The lyrics seem to be purposely elementary, a wise little trick. But their sound is far from nerdy. The first three tracks (“Robotic Love”, “Custodians”, and “Shopclass”) are 2-minute blasts of heavy toned guitars, rapid drumming, Ramones progressions, pop-punk melodies, and sweet harmonies. “Hall Monitor” continues the sound and theme, but slows the tempo down a bit. “My Girl” could have fit perfectly on _Short Music for Short People._ I love the simple, yet profound lyric, “She’s my girl, not your girl”. And “Pills”, which rounds out Side 1, is arguably the best song on the Dorkatron side. Maybe because the song structure is slightly different. Or maybe because the sound skews a bit from the rest of the record, particularly during the chorus. Either way, it’s a clever way to end the first side, forcing us to pay more attention the second time around.      On the flip side, 7 Years Bad Luck come out swinging right away on “Comatose”, with a hardcore-esque opening, gruff vocals, and a catchy chorus. The next track, “Out”, changes the feel slightly, adding some skatepunk to the mix, without straying too far from the overall sound of the album. This track, as well as “Milk Teeth” (track 11), which remind me a little of NOFX, are a welcomed change. “You, The Ocean And Me”, slows down the tempo and is reminiscent of some Wizo songs (the songs they sang in English). “Better Joke”, probably my favorite song on this side with it’s killer opening, combines a little bit of everything on both sides of the record. It’s a pop- punk song at heart that’s rough around the edges, enough so that it doesn’t cower at all from the punk rock sound. And “Movie Star” closes the record, forcing us to be patient, making sure that we’re still paying attention.      I love when I’m able to listen to a band for the first time and get sucked right in. And it’s even better when it’s 2 bands! This split has made me a fan of both groups and I’m definitely going to check out their back catalogues. And this is undoubtedly a must have for fans of either band.

“I think the administration is going to find itself in a very difficult position. It is the anniversary of the massacre at Tiananmen Square and normally the US is in a position to really make… and I think it will, it will remind international audiences of what happened then, especially in light of what’s going on in Hong Kong right now,” said Trubowitz.

Both Season 1 and Season 2 of Narogami were released in 2014 and 2015, individually. While Season 1 had 12 episodes, Season 2 was included a sum of 13 episodes. Thus, based on past seasons, it very well may be viewed as that Season 3 of Narogami will comprise of 12-13 episodes. Precise data will be out just when authorities will make any declaration of the Noragami Season 3 release date. Yet till at that point, we can just think about this. Stay tuned with us for additional updates on Season 3.

No amount of warnings could have prepared me for the fact that mom life is 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. I suppose it's one of those things you have to experience to fully understand. There are no days off and it gets quite intense. My decision to be a stay-at-home mom and eventually, a work-from-home mom, only heightened the intensity. With the exception of a two-day training I was once required to attend for work, my daughter and I haven't spent more than four hours apart since the day she was born. I do virtually everything -- including working a full-time job and using the restroom -- with her either directly by my side or somewhere close by. We live in a different state from the majority of our relatives, so with the exception of my parents coming by to visit, we don't really have the option of someone looking after her. At this point, it feels normal because it's literally all we have ever known. For this reason, a meme that recently began circulating on Facebook really hit home with me. The meme was targeted at mothers and read:

For the last few years, our team at Vanderbilt University, Gustavo Goldman's team at Sao Paulo University in Brazil and many other collaborators around the world have been collecting samples of fungi from patients infected with different species of Aspergillus molds. One of the species we are particularly interested in is Aspergillus nidulans, a relatively common and generally harmless fungus. Clinical laboratories typically identify the species of Aspergillus causing the infection by examining cultures of the fungi under the microscope. The problem with this approach is that very closely related species of Aspergillus tend to look very similar in their broad morphology or physical appearance when viewing them through a microscope.

In other games, I managed to outmanoeuvre the enemy pretty decisively, only to have a tooled up nutter with a fancy shield mow his way methodically through all my exhausted units, even as the last members of his own army fled the field. With that said, I don't think the balance issue here is either fun- ruining, or insurmountable. The main issue is once again split attention, as heroes are too powerful not to want to squeeze every last bit of efficiency from, but not so powerful that you can leave them to do their own thing for long.

Reunions are all the rage these days, what with the cast of _Friends_ finally set to get back together, and Josh Gad working to reunite movie franchise stars via Zoom - but one show that currently has no plans for a get-together is _The Big Bang Theory_.


  While fans of the hit American sitcom would love to see likes of Jim Parsons' Sheldon Cooper and Kaley Cuoco's Penny back on the same screen, it doesn't look like it's going to happen anytime soon.


  Speaking to _Metro.co.uk_ , Amy Farrah Fowler actress Mayim Bialik said there's been no talk of a reunion yet, as most of the stars are busy with other projects.

McGregor bounced back from that loss in January when he finished Donald "Cowboy" Cerrone in just 40 seconds in a welterweight bout at UFC 246, but his path back to the lightweight title seemed to be blocked by the host of active contenders for Khabib's title.


  However, following Justin Gaethje's interim title victory over Tony Ferguson at UFC 249, White's comments appeared to install McGregor as the No. 2 contender, behind Gaethje, for Khabib's title.


  But despite his suggestion that McGregor sit tight and wait, White also admitted the mercurial Irishman may still want to get back into the cage earlier, and said the UFC would look to put on an appropriate fight in that situation.


   _"You know him. Maybe he wants to fight before that and if he does, we can figure something out,"_ he said.


   _"But I think that's the move for him right now."_

Later that night I tuned in to Levin, who makes up in bile what he lacks in charm. Though Levin’s show is cut from the same cloth as Limbaugh’s—aging white dude soliloquizing for three hours about his interesting opinions—it is dyed in a different pattern. For all his flaws, Limbaugh is fundamentally an entertainer, a rock radio jock who somehow never gets around to playing any records. Levin is made from much stranger stuff. He reminds me of the person you would least want to sit next to at a dinner party, aggressive and needy and apt to ascribe a moral valence to your menu choices.

The rest of the county offices had uncontested primaries with Greg Graver and Whitney Hein earning the Republican nominations for sheriff and auditor, respectively. Neither had a Democrat running in the opposite primary.


  For state office, there were no contested primaries. Incumbents Lee Hein (R) and Andy McKean (D) are both running for reelection and will face challenges from Everett Chase and Steven Bradley, respectively, come November. Sen. Dan Zumbach (R) also ran unopposed for his party’s nomination. No Democrat was on the ballot to challenge him.


  For federal office, Ashley Hinson was the overwhelming choice for Jones County voters to challenge Congresswoman Abby Finkenauer (D) for her seat in the House of Representatives. Hinson received nearly 82 percent of the vote, handily defeating Thomas Hansen. Across the district, Hinson won the nomination with nearly 78 percent of the vote.


  In a crowded Democratic field seeking the nomination to challenge Joni Ernst for her senate seat, Jones County voters selected Theresa Greenfield as their nominee. Greenfield received 50.7 percent of the vote in Jones County, with Michael Franken being the next closest with 30.5 percent. Statewide, with 69 of 99 counties reporting, Greenfield earned the nomination with 47.7 percent of the vote.


  Due to COVID-19, a push was made for people to vote via absentee ballots. According to the initial numbers, 2,797 of the 3,551 ballots cast were absentee ballots. That comes out to nearly 80 percent of the ballots cast. The previous high for absentee ballots cast in a primary election in Jones County was around 400.


  The primary results will not be official until the canvass of the votes is completed.

Karnal The temple priests, pandas, sadhus, shopkeepers, and devotees of Kurukshetra are eagerly waiting for June 8, when the temples of the holy city will reopen after being closed to the devotees for more than two and half months.Ramji Lal, a sadhu, said, "I have never faced such difficulties in my life. Hundreds of sadhus here have been living hand to mouth as the temples were closed and people could not come out from their homes to do any charity."Reacting to the arrangements made by the government to feed the needy, he said, "They only provide free food to ration or Aadhar card holders. But we are sadhus, we don't have any identity cards. We survive only on the charity of people."It was also a tough time for over 120 pandas living in the vicinity of Sanhit Sarovar as their earnings plummeted to negligible levels."In the past two months, I have earned only ₹1,100 from Yajman (customer). It was very difficult for us to manage as I used to earn above ₹25,000 per month earlier," said Panda Sehal Mishra."Let us see how people react to the government's decision to reopen religious places," he added. People, who run eateries and religious paraphernalia shops outside the temples said that they were eagerly waiting for June 8 but were not sure whether as many devotees will turn up now."Since the morning, I have sold only three cups of tea and one samosa. It will take about six months for this situation to normalise," said Virbhan, a 62-year-old tea vendor at Brahm Sarovar. Amarjit Singh, who sells religious paraphernalia outside the Badharkali Temple, said, "For the past two months, I have been unable to pay rent for my shop and house as my earnings were badly hit owing to the closure of temples amid the lockdown.""My shop is my only source of income. I am facing difficulties in feeding my family of five," he added. Shivani, who sells books and idols of Hindu deities at Brahma Sarovar, said, "We are the biggest victims of this lockdown as we have not been able to earn anything in the past two months." She added, "With the number of cases on the rise, I don't think the devotees will take the risk to come to temples."NO DIRECTIONS FROM DIST ADMNEven though the ministry of home affairs has allowed the state governments to reopen religious places in non-containment zones, most of the priests and shopkeepers fear that restrictions on the movement of devotees may continue. They have yet not received any directions from the district administration in this regard."We know that the union government has allowed us to reopen temples but we don't have any permission from the district authorities yet, let's see what they decide upon," said Karan Dhiman, a clerk at Tirupati Balaji temple.When asked about the plans to reopen the temples, Kurukshetra deputy commissioner Dhirender Khadgata said, "Proper guidelines related to the movement of devotees in temples will be issued as per the directions of the government."

OTTAWA -- The Canadian economy is showing green shoots with reports on home sales, consumer spending and new job postings trending upwards after the coronavirus pandemic forced shutdowns and caused a record plunge in economic activity.


  The Bank of Canada held its key interest rate steady on Wednesday, noting the impact of COVID-19 appears to have peaked and saying it now expects the Canadian economy to resume growth in the third quarter.


  The bank's more positive tone boosted the Canadian dollar to a three-month high against its U.S. counterpart on Wednesday, while Canada's main stock index has rebounded nearly 40% from its March low as investors bet on economic recovery.


  Canada's 13 provinces and territories have been gradually reopening their economies in recent weeks, and while the pandemic continues to weigh heavily on economic activity, the picture is not as dire as it was even a few weeks ago.


  Housing sales in Toronto, Canada's biggest city, jumped by 55% in May from April and the average selling price gained 4.6%, though sales and listings remained well below last year's levels. Bidding wars, too, have returned to hot neighborhoods.


  Home buyer Ashleigh Patterson lost out on one Toronto home in a bidding war in late May. Two days later she snapped up another. Now she is preparing to sell her townhouse and hoping the economic rebound means it too will have multiple offers.


  "If you had told me two months ago you're going to sell your home during a pandemic, I would have told you you were absolutely bonkers," said Patterson.


  Compared with late March, Canadians started spending again in May on things like a round of golf and clothes, and they began driving more, according to an RBC economics report released this week.


  There have been huge line-ups outside stores like TJX-owned Winners and Inditex-owned Zara, which recently reopened in Canada's most populous province of Ontario, according to social media posts.


  And spending on home and lifestyle products has boomed, said Karl Littler, Senior VP, Public Affairs at the Retail Council of Canada.


  "Consumers have not been on vacation. They're not paying commuting costs… And so for quite a number of Canadians there is some more disposable income in play," he said.


  Commercial transport trucks crossing into Canada from the United States each week jumped 15.6% in the third week of May from a low in early April, though volumes are still down 25% from a year earlier, according to Canadian Border Services Agency data.


  New job postings were up 20% on May 29 compared with May 3, according to Indeed Hiring Lab Canada, though trends are subdued compared with last year.


  The country lost a record-breaking 2 million jobs in April and the unemployment rate surged to 13% amid coronavirus shutdowns. The May jobs report is due on Friday.


  And while manufacturing activity contracted for the third straight month in May, the pace of decline was less severe than in April, according to PMI data released this week. (Reporting by Julie Gordon; additional reporting by Fergal Smith in Toronto; editing by Steve Scherer and Chris Reese)

Stay-at-home orders are being lifted and social distancing protocol is being loosened. Stores are opening. Parks are opening. Restaurants are opening. But we are in this weird gray zone in which no official party has said, "It is perfectly safe to resume your usual activities and the risk of infection is zero - the virus has been eliminated." There's no vaccine. There's no cure. We're reopening because the effects of staying closed much longer might have been worse for our country than the effects of opening will be. But it's very much an every man for himself scenario. The risk is still very much there, we've just been given the freedom to take that risk, and choose how and when we take precautions to minimize it. Some individuals see the country opening up as a sign that it's all good. If you aren't one of those people, but you live with one, you could find yourself in a very tense situation. Everything your partner does affects you right now. If he goes out, it's as if you've gone out, too. He can bring the virus back into the home. And your efforts to stay home feel pointless if your partner is making no such effort. But these divisions of opinions are happening. Here is what it's like when you and your partner disagree on social distancing.

The "I can't breathe" campaign, then, also serves as a good reminder of the limits of viral campaigns. Despite the ad being a rare, emotionally effective corporate gesture, raising awareness and urging viewers to get uncomfortable and demand change, it also shows the pitfalls of relying on messaging alone. Racial injustice and police brutality in America don't end by posting a black box on Instagram, or making a one-time donation to a bail fund, or airing a compelling ad on your channels for 1/164th of a day; it also means taking action behind the scenes, too, to ensure a more equal, more just world.

SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (AP) — Organizers have scrapped plans to mandate social distancing during President Donald Trump's appearance at a July 3 Mount Rushmore fireworks display and won't limit the crowd due to coronavirus concerns, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem said Thursday. The Republican governor said the National Park Service is dolling out 7,500 tickets via lottery for the event, which marks the first time in a decade that fireworks will be set off at the memorial in recognition of Independence Day. “There will be no better place to celebrate our independence,” Noem said. “We are excited that President Trump will be joining us for this event.” Event organizers did not reduce the number of tickets due to the coronavirus pandemic, and Noem said she isn't concerned an influx of tourists would heighten the risk. Coronavirus infections are on a downward trend in the state and hospitals are prepared to handle more infections if needed, she said. People who don't get tickets to the event will be able to gather outside the monument grounds to watch the fireworks, Noem said. Secretary of Tourism Jim Hagen said there will be fewer tickets offered than in previous years, but that was already in the works to help with crowd control. The state is actively marketing itself as a summer tourism destination, but Hagen said he expects more people are interested in road trips rather than flying. South Dakota is focused on markets within driving distance, he said.

Pricing, it was in the script, we are seeing increased costs on peanuts and on coffee. There is a number of components, particularly in the coffee, in terms of how we get to a total delivered cost. So to the extent, obviously we're very cautious in monitoring all of the various price gouging laws that are out there, but we do expect to be able to recover in a prudent and very well justified way, those cost increases throughout the year.

As protests rage on in all 50 of the United States (and Puerto Rico) and several other countries throughout the world, it’s hard to believe just two weeks ago, the coronavirus was the number one story on everyone’s mind. While we’ve got more pressing issues to worry about right now, the virus definitely didn’t go away, and businesses that were put into a tough position due to COVID-19 closures are still seeing a steep decline without any opening date in sight.

Hong Kong has long been the only place on Chinese soil where a mass commemoration of the June 4 crackdown is held. This fact has been a litmus test of sorts for the city's autonomy from China, which has shrunk considerably in recent years, culminating in the national security law, which Beijing has said is necessary to prevent the type of violent unrest seen last year.
 That unrest had been resuming as Hong Kong came out of the coronavirus crisis, and social distancing regulations relaxed. But police had responded to earlier protests with overwhelming numbers, and used tear gas and pepper spray to disperse several gatherings in recent weeks.
 Thursday saw a complete reversal in tactics, as police stayed largely out of sight as several thousand people ignored fences and signs to gather illegally in Victoria Park. It was a striking contrast, perhaps a deliberate one, with protests in the US, which Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam on Tuesday pointed at to accuse critics of hers in Washington of "double standards."
 Crowds began dispersing soon after 8 p.m. local time, following the lighting of candles and a moment of silence to remember the hundreds, possibly thousands, who were killed in the Tiananmen crackdown.
 At its peak, the crowd spilled across two football pitches, and while there were considerably more gaps than in previous years, it was a major display of defiance in a city that has seemed somewhat shell-shocked in recent weeks by news of the national security law.
 The next major test, of both the pro-democracy movement and the authorities, will come as early as next week, which sees two key anniversaries of last year's protest movement.
 About 1 million people marched against an extradition bill with China on June 9, 2019, while three days later, protesters blockaded the city's legislature and clashed with police to prevent the law being passed. It was eventually withdrawn in September 2019, by which point the anti-government movement had grown substantially, with its goals expanded beyond a single bill.

The ruling party has said Nkurunziza will have the title "Supreme Guide" after he steps down, and many believe he will wield considerable influence behind the scenes.

Add fellow outgoing senior and goalkeeper Payton Berlin as an All-VVC/All- Vermilion County special mention pick, and that’s a healthy batch of talent Cornjerkers coach Kevin Root will need to replace in 2020.


  Ben Brown, an All-VVC/All-Vermilion County honorable mention selection last season during his sophomore campaign with Hoopeston Area, isn’t too worried about what the future holds, though.


  “People aren’t going to think, losing eight seniors, you’ll be that good,” Brown said. “But I think we will.”


  Even with Root trying to retool his lineup on the fly, confidence remains among the Cornjerkers because of their recent track record.


  Root said his Class of 2020’s last two seasons constituted the most wins recorded by a group in team history during such a timeframe. Hoopeston Area cobbled together 15 victories in 2019 and a school-best 21 last year.


  “What they did in the regular season and what they did for younger kids,” Root said, “shows the work ethic you need to put in to succeed.”


  Now, the Cornjerkers will attempt to create similar results with a different look.


  Brown and fellow juniors-to-be Isaias Diaz, Kamerin Cade, Nick Hofer and Kayden Wallace, as well as senior Will Nogle, likely will be at the forefront of whatever Hoopeston Area achieves in the near future.


  “We only have one senior (Nogle) out this year, so we’re going to be a very young team,” Root said. “A lot of these freshmen and sophomores are going to have to fill spots in the starters. But the one senior kind of hurts us, being overloaded last year with so many seniors and now we’ve got one this year.”


  A good deal of the Cornjerkers’ offense is departing with their recent graduates.

Deux plans sont prévus. Le plan B est simple, si la reprise de la Serie A n’est pas possible le 20 juin, on devrait assister à des playoffs et des playouts pour clôturer l'exercice 2019-2020. Le plan C est plus surprenant. Si le championnat devait reprendre puis être à nouveau suspendu, le classement final pourrait alors être établi grâce à un algorithme sur la base des matchs restant à jouer.

The artists said ...

“It’s really different without the fans, because there is less atmosphere, no screaming after every corner or chance," Kimmich said. "But the positive is you can communicate with each other. You can speak with each other. You can hear what the coach is screaming on the touchline. Maybe the focus is more on the game. It’s not like a show. Also there is no more big show from the players any more, lying on the ground and screaming. It’s more focused on the game."

Después de tanto tiempo, esta pista en Alemania abre una nueva luz.


  Gerry y Kate McCann "están agradecidos y se congratulan por este llamamiento a testigos", dijo su portavoz, Clarence Mitchell, el jueves a la BBC.


  "Solo quieren saber qué le pasó a su hija, averiguar la verdad y llevar a los responsables ante la justicia", agregó.


  "No han perdido la esperanza de encontrarla viva, a pesar del paso del tiempo", sin embargo "son realistas", afirmó.


  "De las miles de pistas y potenciales sospechosos mencionados en el pasado o discutidos en los medios, nunca ha habido nada tan claro, procedente no de una fuerza policial, sino de tres", subrayó Mitchell.

“President Trump’s walk to St. John's was confrontational, at the wrong time of day, and it distracted from his important message in the Rose Garden about our national grief, racism, peaceful protests, and lawful assembly,” added Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., who is not on the ballot this year. “The President’s important message was drowned out by an awkward photo op.”

Taking cognizance of the petition filed by BJP MLA Ashish Shelar which raised concerns over an incident at Sion Hospital where Covid-19 infected patients were being treated next to the bodies of patients who had succumbed to the virus, the Bombay high court has directed the BMC and the state government to explain the process of handling and cremating bodies of those who have died due to the infectious disease.


  The division bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice A A Sayyed while hearing a clutch of public interest litigations filed by various individuals, organisations and politicos was informed by advocates Rajendra Pai and Ameet Mehta that several videos from the hospital wherein bodies of deceased Covid-19 victims kept on beds or on the floor adjacent to people taking treatment for coronavirus had emerged.


  He sought a direction to the government and BMC to immediately stop the practice of keeping bodies of Covid-19 infected victims in wards where people are being treated for the infection.


  Shelar's advocates further argued, "Retention of the bodies in active wards in Sion Hospital as recently reported is a matter of serious concern. It gives rise to medical as well as humanitarian issues. No civilized society can afford to repeatedly witness such incidents."


  In light of these submissions, Shelar sought directions to the authorities to initiate a probe into the incident and register cases against the hospital staff responsible for letting the bodies of the deceased remain in active wards and to follow procedure laid down by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and Central government for disposal of bodies of Covid-19 victims.


  After hearing the submissions, the court directed the state government and the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to respond with details about how bodies of Covid-19 victims were handled and disposed and posted the matter for hearing next week.

However, with very few companies providing 5G hardware, companies, including Telus earlier this year, turned to Huawei. This poses data security concerns, especially in light of increasing tensions over the possible extradition of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou. Telus moving toward using some of the few available competitors to Huawei should be applauded for the future security of internet in the South Cariboo.

They didn’t think it’s a crisis. By the same token, all of this destruction -- the rioting, the looting, the mayhem -- it’s just not a big deal. Mattis says, "We must not be distracted by a small number of lawbreakers. The protests are defined by tens of thousands of people of conscience who are insisting that we live up to our values, our values as people and our values as a nation."

Starting at now, authorities haven't reported the Noragami Season 3 release date. Yet it is affirmed that Season 3 will release in January 2021. The purpose for this is, beforehand, the creators needed more substance to deliver Season 3 of this mainstream anime. However in 2019, the 21st volume of this novel was released, and now the producers have enough material to make its Season 3. That is the reason we are trusting that authorities will before long release its date and different details.

The artists said ...

"Every time I stand with my hand over my heart, looking at that flag, and singing the national anthem, that's what I think about, and in many cases, it brings me to tears, thinking about all that has been sacrificed," Brees said. "Not just those in the military, but for that matter, those throughout the civil rights movements of the '60s, and everyone, and all that has been endured by so many people up until this point. And is everything right with our country right now? No, it's not. We still have a long way to go, but I think what you do by standing there and showing respect to the flag with your hand over your heart, is it shows unity. It shows that we are all in this together, we can all do better and that we are all part of the solution."

That's a long way of saying that the New York Times made a grave error in publishing an incendiary, terrifying take on the protests entitled "Send in the Troops" by Senator Tom Cotton. (We are linking it here but we don't encourage you to click.) In the op-ed, Cotton repeats claims he has made on Twitter that the military should be used against US citizens to end the "riots." He justifies this with horror stories of violence and for good measure brings in the conservative boogie man of "antifa."

Despite its limitations, telehealth is here to stay, and there are some benefits. There’s a lot to learn from seeing a family’s home environment, and the endorsement of my treatment plan by what I call “the voice of God” — the grandmother speaking off-camera — is invaluable. Virtual appointments work for simple health ailments and are convenient for working parents or those recovering from childbirth or surgery. But continuing this service will require more fiscal support for innovative measures such as our vaccine van; infant care videos translated into many languages; more support staff such as social workers and patient navigators with diverse language capabilities; and appropriate reimbursement from insurers for the novel, but not lesser, clinical management involved.

According to Stout, the department collected DNA samples from the bear to test against samples taken from Becwar’s clothing. He noted that the bear was in poor condition but not emaciated and had no injuries. He added that the bear’s gall bladder was full of fluid, as though it had just emerged from its den after months of not eating.


  “When we opened up the stomach, it looked like it hadn’t been eating hardly at all,” Stout said. “There was just a little bit of grass and water in its stomach. That gave us a good clue that it wasn’t a defensive attack. It wasn’t trying to defend prey.”


  In light of this, the department is unsure why the bear appeared to be sticking around the area. Stout said it’s possible that the bear was attracted to a nearby parked vehicle.


  “It obviously wasn’t getting food there, so why it was sticking around, we don’t know,” he said.


  Stout reminded the public that bears have fairly recently emerged from their dens. Moose and caribou are currently in calving season, and some bears will have cubs with them, which can often result in females being more aggressive and protective.


  “You’ve got to be prepared, making a lot of noise, making other animals aware that you’re in the vicinity,” Stout said. “Female bears that are out there are going to be defensive of their cubs, and all bears are going to be defensive of kill sites.”


  Stout said that the Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. has conducted a flyover since the attack and did not see any other bears in the vicinity.

Back in those days, you see, the horse had only just been invented (by the Greek philosopher Peter Horse), and they still hadn't developed any decent batteries for it yet. So while Troy doesn't entirely deny you the innate Total War pleasure of smashing a load of armoured quadropeds into a rectangle of blokes, cavalry units are few and far between. They are a treat, to smash some archers up with after you've had your main meal. Battles are about infantry, therefore. And to make up for this superficial narrowing of unit variety, your infantry types are way more varied in capability than ever. Most importantly, there are three armour classes: light, medium and heavy. Heavy troops are… well, heavy. They plod around and get tired easily. Light troops, meanwhile, will go down like bundles of sticks in the front line, but can be really fast - Achilles' Aeginian runners in the demo, for example, might as well have been horses themselves, given the rate at which they scampered about.

Chicago-based restaurant and entertainment group 16” on Center is known for the Empty Bottle and Thalia Hall music venues, Revival Food Hall in the Loop and restaurants and bars such as The Promontory and Saint Lou’s Assembly.


  The project includes a more than 18,000-square-foot food hall on the ground floor, accessible from the building’s historic lobby and from a large riverfront plaza. That outdoor space along with the lobby and potentially its 3.5-acre rooftop park could be used for live music, culinary events and other arts and entertainment, according to 16” on Center. The events space, as well as the food hall, will be open to the public.

"Non era mai successo prima di avviare i saldi ad agosto – spiega l’assessore alle attivita produttive e commercio Stefano Ciuoffo – ma, a causa della chiusura forzata per l’emergenza Covid 19, la Conferenza delle Regioni, nella riunione dello scorso 7 maggio, ha deciso di posticipare la data di inizio proprio per la straordinarieta della situazione che abbiamo vissuto. Il presidente della Conferenza delle Regioni, Stefano Bonaccini, con una nota dell’8 maggio inviata a tutte le Regioni, ha raccomandato di dare seguito a tale decisione, per una omogenea applicazione su tutto il territorio nazionale, e la Toscana si e adeguata dopo aver sentito le categorie del commercio locali. Contestualmente, preso atto dell’eccezionalita del 2020, abbiamo sospeso il divieto delle vendite promozionali nei 30 giorni antecedenti l'inizio dei saldi. Vendite che quindi potranno continuare anche a luglio, tenendo conto sia delle esigenze dei commercianti che di quelle della clientela”.

NEW YORK -- Expectations that the global economy has dodged the worst-case scenarios for the coronavirus pandemic have led to a dramatic selloff in U.S. government bonds from their record highs, pushing the yield curve to its steepest level since March.


  Investors will get a chance this week to see whether the U.S. Federal Reserve agrees with their optimism. The U.S. central bank is expected to hold a two- day meeting that will conclude Wednesday, the first since a meeting in April in which Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that the U.S. economy could feel the weight of the economic shutdown for more than a year.


  While the Fed could introduce additional bond-buying programs known as quantitative easing or yield-curve control measures to target short-term rates, some fund managers say they expect that yields would need to rise significantly from here to justify any intervention in the bulk of the curve. Instead, they are watching for hints that the central bank believes the worst part of the coronavirus crisis has passed.


  "They are really in this transition phase," said Eric Stein, co-director of global income and portfolio manager at Eaton Vance. "Markets are functioning, if not all the way back to pre-shock levels, with very strong debt issuance and market improvement, even though the real economy is incredibly weak."


  As a result, Stein is looking for signs the Fed believes the economic rebound can support the rise in yields.


  "The Fed will be okay with a slow creep higher, particularly with a backdrop of a recovery, but if it moves too much and destabilizes the recovery, there's a reason for concern," he said.


  Ed Al-Hussainy, senior interest rate analyst at Columbia Threadneedle, expects the Fed to focus on its newly launched Main Street Lending Program, which is meant to support small- and medium-sized businesses facing financial strain because of the pandemic, as opposed to introducing significant new stimulus measures.


  "The Fed is likely to communicate that there is more scope for fiscal measures but that is a very uncomfortable spot to be in," he said. "We won't have a clear sense of direction of the economy until well into the fourth quarter because all the sequential data now is massively positive."


  The manufacturing ISM index rose to 43.1 in May from 41.5 in April, while weekly jobless claims fell to 1.877 million from 2.126 million the week before.


  "Recent economic reports in the U.S. have been uniformly weak, though not any worse than expected," said Kevin Cummins, senior U.S. economist at NatWest Markets.


  Eddy Vataru, lead portfolio manager at Osterweis Capital Management, said the larger risk for the Fed is that rates remain too low, making it unlikely that there will be a significant push for yield curve-control measures. "We can now discredit the worst outcomes of the virus. The sentiment around the risks around the virus have really changed," he said, pointing to declining infection and fatality rates in coronavirus hot spots such as the New York City region.


  As a result, he is moving into corporate debt and mortgage-backed securities and shying away from Treasuries, which he said have "no investment value" at their current yields.


  "At the end of the day, we have a ton of stimulus, both fiscal and monetary, and the markets have reacted to it," he said. (Reporting by David Randall; Editing by Bernadette Baum)

Growing up, my mom would always get a delivery of persimmon cookies at Christmas time and I fell in love. As I became an adult, I missed out on those cookies. So, when the lovely Mrs. Dossi came into my life, I made sure that she learned how to bake those magical treats.


  Now I’ll admit, her first attempt wasn’t great. For whatever reason, the cookies were green, instead of the usual brown. But was I about to forfeit the opportunity to have her ever make me the cookies again by making rude remarks about her less than stellar batch? Nope. I ate every darn one.


  Since that inaugural attempt, she has mastered the art of persimmon cookies and I have to use some restraint to not eat them all in one sitting. But it’s only at Christmas time when I crave those cookies. I think if I was given a plate of persimmon cookies today, I wouldn’t be in any hurry to finish them.


  I grew up with two grandmothers who were excellent bakers. One grandmother was great at baking cookies, while the other could bake anything from cakes, pies, breads, brownies and cookies. And she would make everything from scratch.


  I always knew what was baked special and what was baked for me. Grandma Dossi would often bake things for her church, so those were off limits. But she always baked a little extra, and that’s what I’d be able to have. She made it clear that I was not to eat the good stuff. She was the type of person who felt her baking mirrored who she was. She didn’t want anyone of any importance to taste a subpar baked item.


  While I miss my grandmother’s baking, there is always one thing in my house that I can count on being baked. The lovely Mrs. Dossi makes dynamite banana bread. It’s at the point now where she doesn’t even need a recipe and it is absolutely delicious.


  I know things are hard right now, so maybe a nice slice of cake or batch of cookies can bring some much-needed joy. And you’ll know that I’m happy around Christmas time, because I’d have once again polished off a plate of persimmon cookies by myself. And I’m not ashamed to admit that.

A day that began with hope that New York City was beginning to find a way out of the crisis caused by the coronavirus and a week of angry demonstrations over police brutality ended Wednesday with more violence.Peaceful protests over the death of George Floyd drew thousands of people, but were broken up by police as rain poured down about an hour after the city's 8 pm curfew went into effect.Then, with the streets quiet for the first time in days, police said a man ambushed officers on an anti-looting patrol in Brooklyn, stabbing him in the neck. The attacker was shot by responding officers and was in critical condition.Two officers suffered gunshot wounds to their hands in the chaos, but all three wounded officers were expected to recover.Police Commissioner Dermot Shea called it "a completely, cowardly, despicable, unprovoked attack on a defenseless police officer." While he declined to say what motivated the attack, he drew a line to the heated rhetoric of the past week, in which angry crowds decrying police violence have also hurled insults, and sometimes bottles, bricks and firebombs, at officers and their vehicles."Words matter," Shea said.More protests were planned for Thursday around New York, and Gov. Andrew Cuomo called for a statewide moment of silence at 2 p.m., to coincide with a memorial service in Minnesota for Floyd.Wednesday night's attack came at the end of the day in which the police had drawn praise for bringing a stop to days of pilfering and destruction in some parts of the city, but also harsh criticism for rough tactics used to enforce the city's curfew.About an hour after the 8 p.m. deadline to get off the street, officers began moving in on crowds of demonstrators in Manhattan and Brooklyn, at times blasting people with pepper spray or using batons to shove people who didn't move fast enough.Asked whether those officers had acted appropriately, de Blasio said Thursday that he had not seen videos of officers using batons on peaceful protesters. He added, " if there's anything that needs to be reviewed."The mayor said protesters should observe the curfew that's in place through Sunday. "If at a certain point, officers say, 'It's time, people need to go now,' people need to listen to that," he said.NYPD Chief of Department Terence Monahan said about 60 people were arrested near Central Park for defying an order to go home."When we have these big crowds, especially in this area, especially where we've had the looting, no more tolerance," Monahan said. "They have to be off the street."City Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, who attended a rally in downtown Brooklyn, expressed outrage that police had broken up the peaceful demonstration by shoving protesters and hitting them with batons."I can't believe what I just witnessed & experienced," Williams wrote on Twitter. He called the use of force on nonviolent protesters "disgusting."As the evening deepened, there were few reports of the mayhem that had occurred on several days of demonstrations, when protesters burned police vehicles and showered officers with debris.

With the exception of “Hotel Dusk,” I’d say “999” is the most visually ambitious adventure game on DS (and there are many). In addition to its absurdly detailed character portraits (each with their own ridiculously smooth animation), there are 3D models of items and scores of complex prerendered backgrounds as well as several detailed still images used at different points in the story. This multi-media approach sets “999” apart from the competition; while most DS adventure games tended to use sprite-work (“Ace Attorney,” “Professor Layton”), pre-rendering (“Trace Memory”), or full-on 3D (“Hotel Dusk”), few juggled all three, and even fewer did so successfully.


  The occasional prerendered FMV cutscenes are thrown in for good measure too, and cement the game’s status as one of the most ambitious adventure games on DS. Its soundtrack, while often subdued, adds a lot to the more tense and poignant scenes of the game, and it’s no wonder why the sequel reused so much of it.


  “999” may be on outdated hardware, but it lives up to its cult hype. It’s got style and substance in spades, its writing puts some of the best in gaming to shame, and while its puzzles are generally shallow, there’s nothing quite like it. You can find it cheap online or in most game stores.

The temple priests, pandas, sadhus, shopkeepers, and devotees of Kurukshetra are eagerly waiting for June 8, when the temples of the holy city will reopen after being closed to the devotees for more than two and half months.


  Ramji Lal, a sadhu, said, "I have never faced such difficulties in my life. Hundreds of sadhus here have been living hand to mouth as the temples were closed and people could not come out from their homes to do any charity."


  Reacting to the arrangements made by the government to feed the needy, he said, "They only provide free food to ration or Aadhar card holders. But we are sadhus, we don't have any identity cards. We survive only on the charity of people."


  It was also a tough time for over 120 pandas living in the vicinity of Sanhit Sarovar as their earnings plummeted to negligible levels.


  "In the past two months, I have earned only ₹1,100 from Yajman (customer). It was very difficult for us to manage as I used to earn above ₹25,000 per month earlier," said Panda Sehal Mishra.


  "Let us see how people react to the government's decision to reopen religious places," he added.


  People, who run eateries and religious paraphernalia shops outside the temples said that they were eagerly waiting for June 8 but were not sure whether as many devotees will turn up now.


  "Since the morning, I have sold only three cups of tea and one samosa. It will take about six months for this situation to normalise," said Virbhan, a 62-year-old tea vendor at Brahm Sarovar.


  Amarjit Singh, who sells religious paraphernalia outside the Badharkali Temple, said, "For the past two months, I have been unable to pay rent for my shop and house as my earnings were badly hit owing to the closure of temples amid the lockdown."


  "My shop is my only source of income. I am facing difficulties in feeding my family of five," he added.


  Shivani, who sells books and idols of Hindu deities at Brahma Sarovar, said, "We are the biggest victims of this lockdown as we have not been able to earn anything in the past two months."


  She added, "With the number of cases on the rise, I don't think the devotees will take the risk to come to temples."


  NO DIRECTIONS FROM DIST ADMN


  Even though the ministry of home affairs has allowed the state governments to reopen religious places in non-containment zones, most of the priests and shopkeepers fear that restrictions on the movement of devotees may continue.


  They have yet not received any directions from the district administration in this regard.


  "We know that the union government has allowed us to reopen temples but we don't have any permission from the district authorities yet, let's see what they decide upon," said Karan Dhiman, a clerk at Tirupati Balaji temple.


  When asked about the plans to reopen the temples, Kurukshetra deputy commissioner Dhirender Khadgata said, "Proper guidelines related to the movement of devotees in temples will be issued as per the directions of the government."

One of the most charming things about Troy is its approach to both the aesthetics and the mythic quality of the era. Creative Assembly's Sofia division, for whom Troy is the first standalone Total War outing, are really fond of the idea of "the truth behind the myth", and have tried to make this feel like a historical game wherever possible. If Three Kingdoms was historical by default, but presented through a mythic lens, then Troy is the other way round, taking the stuff of myth and trying to present it with (usually) archaeological sobriety. While part of me would prefer a game that went balls out on gods and monsters, that part of me has Total War: Warhammer 2, and is welcome to play it whenever it likes. As far as the other part of me is concerned, Troy does a really good job of spinning Homer's long and weird poems into something convincingly human, while still feeling larger than life.

A security entrance manufacturer's responsibility to their end user customer is a substantial commitment, extending well beyond the sale with a wide scope of offerings. The goal is to keep all products working smoothly for a decade or more, maximising the owner's investment and enabling hundreds or thousands of people a day to use the entrances safely. To begin with, the manufacturer should offer a preventive maintenance service package. A few visits a year to check on parts, lubrication and software will ensure optimal operation, keeping expensive breakdowns and urgent service requests to a minimum. What if there is a malfunction out of the blue? Interactive, online troubleshooting tools and live assistance by phone or chat can help end users problem-solve until a service technician can arrive. Manufacturers should also have a technical training programme that maintains a solid network of trained technicians. Finally, parts availability is also extremely important.

This trade did not go as either side had hoped. Kesler didn't win the Stanley Cup and is on long-term IR. His demands put Benning in a tough spot due to his short trade list, and the trade resulted in the Canucks ending up with only Sutter and Tanner Pearson in 2019-20, which is pretty underwhelming considering the caliber of player that Kesler was. Although Pearson has been great this season, Sutter has not been impressive over the past five seasons.

According to the governor’s recent order, indoor gyms, fitness centers and recreation centers and skating rinks are on the list to remain closed.
 “We are still not able to open the entire building,” Michaels said. “Indoor swimming and the ice rink are considered a gym.”
 The lifting of limits on these types of facilities is not scheduled to occur until July 4, unless the governor changes the order sooner than that date.
 The Sportsplex had already been taking registrations for swimming lessons to begin on June 15 and a competitive summer swim club to start June 16.
 “We have a number of activities planned (for the pool and rink),” Michaels said. “Please check with us next week on the status. We should know more next week.”
 In the meantime, Michaels said the building will open for sure on June 15 when the Sportplex’s summer day camp begins. Also at that time, the track that circles the ice rink will be available for indoor walkers to come in and use.
 The governor's order allows day camps for children to operate, and Michaels said the camp will go on without the use of the pool or rink.
 All of the outdoor venues on the Sportsplex grounds are open, Michaels noted, including the tennis and pickleball courts, Energy Outlet playground, walking track and the skate ramp park.
 “It has been different,” Michaels said of the recent months during the COVID-19 pandemic. “We kept the ice in and kept thinking we’d be opening, then another two weeks would pass, and another two weeks — this has kind of dragged on.”
 During the closure, Michaels said, “People were in the building, cleaning and doing other odds and ends, but we’re glad to be opening soon.”
 For more information on the availability of activities at the Sportsplex, call (989) 731-3546.
 The Otsego County Animal Shelter remains closed. Melissa FitzGerald, animal control director, said there is no plan in place yet for reopening the building, located at 256 Fairview Road in Gaylord, to the public.
 The shelter, however, began taking applications June 1 for pet adoptions that will be conducted by appointment only.

Chandigarh A third of the 32,594 non-functional industrial units in Punjab are unable to restart manufacturing due to a shortage of raw material and labour.Of the total 2.59 lakh registered industrial units in the state, 2.27 lakh, or say 87%, have commenced their operations after the coronavirus-induced restrictions were eased during the lockdown 4.0 about three weeks ago. The remaining factories are still in lockdown and grappling with non-availability of raw material, shortage of working hands, working capital crunch, and slump in demand for finished products, revealed a survey carried out by the state industries department.About half of these non- functional units - to be precise, 15,598 - are in the state's industrial hub of Ludhiana. As per the data collected by the department through the district industry centres, the non-availability of raw material is the primary reason for the inability of 5,637 industrial units to resume production and 5,288 are facing labour shortage as a large number of migrant workers have returned home.Another 4,548 and 3,587 factories have been held back by the poor demand for their products and finance problems, respectively, whereas 4,427 units are located in containment areas where activities are still not allowed. The industries department has not received information from districts Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar (earlier known as Nawanshahr), Barnala, Gurdaspur, Sangrur, and Pathankot.Industries director Sibin C said some industrial units were having issues related to raw material, labour and finance and are still not able to resume operations, but things would stabilise soon. "The shortage of labour will end sooner than later as passenger trains have resumed. The raw material movement from some parts of the country and abroad remains a matter of concern for some sectors, though," he said, citing the examples of textiles and bicycle sectors, which source their raw material from China.Sibin said the department would also set up a helpdesk at the state headquarters to facilitate industrial units get funds from the ₹20,000-crore subordinate debt announced by the centre for stressed micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) for which the guidelines were awaited. But this is half the story. The industries, which have resumed production, are also no less worried due to rising cost and demand slump. Badish Jindal, president of Federation of Punjab Small Industries Association said power and labour costs had gone up as units were operating less than 50% capacity."Migrant workers are demanding more money and two-part power tariff means we have to have to shell out a lot more for per unit of electricity consumed due to high fixed charges and low consumption. Another problem is delayed payments," he said. The industry associations requested industries minister Sunder Sham Arora, who was in Ludhiana on Thursday, to do away with fixed charges for electricity to industrial consumers for the time being.PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PHDCCI) chairman, Punjab, Karan Gilhotra had also last week termed labour shortage, disruption in supply chain and decline in demand as a serious challenge for the state industry. The factories were shut down after curfew was imposed in the state on March 23. Though the central and state governments later allowed industries, only 7% restarted operations till March 16 but there has been a spurt in their number since.

  “Moreover, factors like dip in business travel due to subdued global macroeconomic environment, increasing use of virtual communication modes by business community and possible continuation of travel restrictions, in some form, by various countries have also significantly influenced the overall scenario,” she said.


  With an almost negligible air traffic in April and May, possible dilemma among travellers to travel amidst continuing pandemic fears and gradual addition of capacities by airlines, passenger traffic at airports is expected to remain under pressure for H1FY2021, with some recovery only likely in the second half, she said.


  Airports in India handled around 345 million passengers in FY2019, with 10-year CAGR of 12% (except for FY2013) over FY2009-2019, driven by strong growth especially in domestic traffic (CAGR of 14% over the same period).


  The top five privatised airports in India (Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Kochi) developed under Public-Private Partnership model have lead from the front, accounting for 55-60% of this passenger traffic.


  Given likelihood of weak traffic for a prolonged period and resultant operations conducted at sub-optimal capacities and at the same time necessity to invest in infrastructure to ensure passenger safety and meet preventive requirements against the pandemic, the airports’ profitability and cashflows are likely to remain under pressure in the near term, ICRA said.


  This risk is further exacerbated in case of the privatised airports, as most of them are in the midst of undertaking sizeable debt-funded capex to expand capacities, it added.


  “Thus far, the underlying business position of the privatised airports has been supported by their strategic importance and sizeable share in the country’s total air traffic; and adequate liquidity profile for most, with sizeable fund availability,” Ms. Arora said.


  “However, a prolonged impact of the pandemic on the operations of these airports, in the absence of any meaningful support from key stakeholders, is likely to result in moderation of their credit profile and liquidity position, which may take some time to restore,” she added.

Not in the loop

A new trailer for Lovecraft Country has dropped. The one-hour HBO show series is an adaptation of the 2016 novel of the same name. With Jordan Peele and J.J. Abrams acting as executive producers, the show has already generated plenty of interest. In light of the worldwide protests against the killing of George Floyd at the hands of a police officer, the themes of racism and bigotry showcased in the trailer feel more relevant than ever. HBO had previously released the following synopsis for the show.

In contrast, macro outlook concerns, low equity valuations and elevated volatility meant companies largely sat on the sidelines when it came to mergers and acquisitions. As credit markets opened up in April, following the significant intervention by central banks, we saw a significant uptick in investment grade debt issuance. Since mid-March, capital markets has been a book run over USD150 billion of global investment grade issuance, and it's led over 80% of corporate debt transactions in the Canadian market.

Another 1.9 million people filed for unemployment benefits for the first time last week, according to data released by the Labor Department on Thursday, marking 11 straight weeks in which millions of Americans have filed claims for jobless benefits.


  But as the economic crisis from coronavirus-related shutdowns continues, it is becoming more difficult to keep track of exactly how many newly out-of-work Americans are receiving or waiting for unemployment benefits, analysts say.


  National "unemployment insurance weekly claims," reported every Thursday by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL), and often referred to as "jobless claims," are a key indicator of the health of the U.S. economy. The figure impacts federal budgets and capital flows, and has been a way to gauge the toll of the pandemic on the country's 160 million workers.


  But the simplest way to calculate that impact - tallying up the number of initial unemployment claims filed each week since a national emergency was declared in March, for a total of 42.6 million - is increasingly flawed, analysts say.


  "The more time goes by, summing up initial claims gets a little dicey," said Heidi Shierholz, senior economist and director of policy for the Economic Policy Institute.


  That's because some people who filed for unemployment benefits early on may have returned to work as businesses reopen, and are no longer receiving them. Other workers who initially filed for traditional unemployment benefits may have switched to a program for independent contract workers and gig workers affected by the pandemic, muddying the waters.


  Another way to figure out who needs jobless benefits could be to focus on the number of people who are currently receiving benefits and those who have applied recently, said Shierholz.


  By that measure, 37.2 million Americans were either receiving benefits or applied over the last couple of weeks, she noted. But this approach can be incomplete, too. Some states, including California, only require people currently receiving benefits, known as continued claims, to file every other week.


  Confusing things even further is the new Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program, which offers benefits to workers like ride-share drivers, who do not traditionally qualify for unemployment benefits. Many states did not get this program up and running until April or May, and there was no data on the programs for 15 states and the District of Columbia in the most recent claims report from the DOL.


  That's despite the fact that many states are tracking how many people have applied for and received these benefits on their public state websites.


  There is typically a lag when states report figures on unemployment assistance programs launched during major disasters, said Michele Evermore, a policy analyst with the National Employment Law Project. "I can see where that would be compounded by dealing with the unusual level of new claims," she said.


  Kansas, for example, started paying out PUA benefits the week of May 25 and said it reported numbers to the DOL. Its figures, however, did not appear in the weekly report. Georgia's labor department said the staff is working on a program to report the benefits to the federal government, while Arizona and Florida said the information has not shown up in the national report because they are only required to report it once a month.


  Nonetheless, the number of Americans filing for jobless benefits each week is still in the millions, suggesting the economy continues to experience fresh shocks from the pandemic.


  "Most of this is new unemployment and that's really striking," said Julia Coronado, president of MacroPolicy Perspectives and a former Fed economist. "It's still really bad." (Reporting by Jonnelle Marte; Additional reporting by Andy Sullivan; Editing by Heather Timmons and Andrea Ricci)

The U.S. National Hurricane Center said it was expected to weaken into a tropical depression on Thursday, but then begin strengthening once it moved back over the Gulf of Mexico on Friday.

There is also need to instill behavior change as an essential part of the ‘new normal’ unfolding in our lives. As we come to terms with a new world unleashed by COVID-19, we must all take greater individual responsibility in rooting out violent extremism from within our borders.

Fangio said he only meant to convey that in his experience, those ills didn't exist in locker rooms or on the playing field where teams rallied behind common goals. “Unfortunately, we don’t live or work only within those confines,” Fangio said. “Outside of those lines -- both in the NFL and society -- there is a lot of work to be done in the areas of diversity and providing opportunities across the board for minorities.”

While Prince Charles stressed in a promotional video accompanying the big reveal that “global warming, climate change, and the devastating loss of biodiversity” are the chief threats facing humanity, the majority of Britons are likely to be more concerned with the devastating recession threatening to engulf the nation completely. The Bank of England warned last month that the UK economy could shrink by 30 percent by the end of the summer. The central bank’s dire predictions – its first official forecast since the pandemic took hold – warned that GDP could decline by 14 percent for 2020, the sharpest single-year drop in over three centuries. And while the Bank of England claimed UK families entered the crisis “in a stronger position than they were before the 2008 financial crisis,” the Office of National Statistics revealed in April that the economy was already headed south even before the lockdown was imposed in March.

Speaking to boxing promoter Eddie Hearn and former world champion boxer Tony Bellew on the "Talk the Talk" podcast, White laid out the scenario that would see McGregor walk straight into another title fight in his very next appearance.


   _"I think that the best thing for him - I'm not saying this is what's going to happen - but in my opinion he lets this Gaethje-Khabib fight play out, then he fights the winner,"_ suggested White.


   _"I think that's the smartest move for him."_


  McGregor has fought just twice at 155 pounds in the UFC. He knocked out Eddie Alvarez at Madison Square Garden at UFC 205 in 2016 to capture the lightweight title and become the UFC's first-ever "champ champ," before switching his attention to boxing, and a megabucks fight with Floyd Mayweather in 2017.


  He was later stripped of both his featherweight and lightweight titles for failing to defend either of them, and eventually made his return to the octagon against UFC lightweight champ Khabib in an ill-tempered matchup at UFC 229 that ended in a huge melee, inside and outside the cage, after Khabib submitted the Irishman in the fourth round.

I'll now provide some highlights of our financial performance. Today, we reported earnings of CAD1.5 billion in a quarter where we recorded a provision of CAD2.8 billion, which I will speak to shortly. We carried our strong momentum from the last quarter into Q2 and North American equity markets hit all-time highs in late February. However, as the COVID-19 pandemic spread, expanding public health crisis led to increased concerns around the global economic outlook, culminating in elevated market uncertainty in March. We supported our clients through these volatile markets as they drew down on their credit facilities in light of liquidity concerns. The severe correction in global markets and widening credit spreads in particular negatively impacted our results this quarter, including unrealized mark-to-market losses in a number of portfolios. This was partly offset by elevated client activity related to significant volatility across asset classes.

Ken, thank you for the question. I would start by just highlighting that -- a couple of things. The team itself, in terms of the people is one of the strongest teams or maybe the strongest team we've ever had, with incredible CPG experience. I would highlight as well, particularly not only the new members of the team, but even those who have been promoted within, have a strong track record of delivering results. And so I couldn't be happier with the team itself. The structure, as you know, hiring a COO and John coming in, had been contemplated for some time. So I think I may have said this before, is that when I became CEO, I wanted to stay closer to the businesses, but had a pretty clear sense that a COO would be required down the road and I'm very pleased, in terms of the way that this leadership team has been structured, it's a little more streamlined. It's going to help drive accountability. And then more specifically to answer your questions, I will tell you the dialog in the room is as rich as it has ever been. There have been a number of -- there's always differing opinions. I will say the conversations always take place with a tremendous amount of mutual respect. And we always get to a place of alignment.

New Delhi [India], June 4 (ANI): Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal has accorded approval to a proposal for setting up a centralised/multifarious testing facility accredited by the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL) in every district so that all test related to agriculture, food, soil, environment, and health, water, etc., can be carried out under one roof.   An official spokesman on Thursday said that at present only four NABL accredited labs are operational in Karnal, Gurugram, Kurukshetra and Kaithal. But labs are conducting testing of potable water quality only. With the Chief Minister's current approval these labs will be upgraded to multifarious testing labs.   The spokesman said that recently a meeting under the chairmanship of Chief Minister Lal was held regarding the discussion on the action plan of 'Jal Jeevan Mission'.   During the meeting, the Chief Minister was apprised that four NABL accredited labs are already functional and the same are to be set up in other 18 districts, while the Chief Minister had instead directed the officers for setting up a centralised/multifarious testing the facility in 18 districts and upgrading these four labs too.

It also adds a new button to press, however. And to be more precise, another button to remember to press in the thick of the action. While also keeping track of a swarm of infantry units who look pretty similar from 100 metres up in the air, and who are just slightly faster than you expect them to be, zooming around after each other like swarms of Total Wasps. Factor in the question of whose flanking bonus is whose, which spear fighters have armour and which don't, who can stalk, and where the mud is, and you're beginning to get an idea of how much there is to bear in mind at any given moment.

And I cannot come up with a good answer to that.”

All passengers and crew will be required to wear masks onboard at all times.  Initially, when flights restart, the Bistro and Boutique service will not be available. Furthermore, all flights will be equipped with spare sanitary equipment including masks, gloves and hand sanitiser to ensure these are available to customers and crew at all times on board if required. easyJet’s aircraft are already fitted with state of art filtration technology. High-efficiency particle arresting filters filter 99.97% of airborne contaminants in the cabin, including viruses and bacteria. These filters are the same as those used in hospitals and through them, the cabin air gets replaced every 3-4 minutes.

The Nasdaq 100 index retreated from an intraday record high on Thursday, with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones indexes also slipping as a rally fueled by hopes of a post-coronavirus economic recovery fizzled out.


  Wall Street's main indexes had gained in early trading as U.S. weekly jobless claims fell below 2 million for the first time since mid-March, bolstering optimism around a pickup in business activity as economies reopened.


  American Airlines Group Inc surged 24.9% after revealing plans to fly more than 55% of its July 2019 domestic capacity and boost its U.S. flight schedule next month. The NYSE Arca airlines index jumped 8.2% to a near three-month high.


  But nine of the 11 S&P 500 sectors were trading lower by midday, with the defensive real estate and utilities indexes leading declines.


  "There's a belief the economy is going to reopen and when you partner that up with the liquidity provided by global central banks, now is a somewhat safe time to be investing in equities," said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York.


  "But (the market is) going to go through periods where it takes a little bit of a pause, especially after seeing the kind of gains we've had in the last couple of days."


  Wall Street's main indexes have recovered sharply from their March lows and the Nasdaq Composite index, which is wider and more closely watched than the Nasdaq 100, is now only 2% below its record high hit in February.


  The rebound has been partly driven by tech-related firms, including Amazon.com Inc and Netflix Inc, deemed "stay-at-home" stocks during the weeks of a lockdown imposed to contain the novel coronavirus.


  The NYSE FANG+TM index, which includes Facebook Inc, Apple Inc, Amazon.com, Netflix, Alphabet Inc, Baidu Inc and Twitter also hit a record high in morning trading.


  "In this market, you need to be selective and technology continues to be one of our favorite sectors," said Larry Adam, chief investment officer at Raymond James in Baltimore, Maryland.


  Meanwhile, nationwide protests over the death of an unarmed black man in police custody dwindled overnight into early Thursday after prosecutors leveled new charges against four Minneapolis policemen implicated in the killing.


  At 12:57 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 97.96 points, or 0.37%, at 26,171.93, the S&P 500 was down 18.33 points, or 0.59%, at 3,104.54 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 75.61 points, or 0.78%, at 9,607.30.


  Jif peanut butter maker J.M. Smucker Co fell 4% after forecasting a decline in full-year sales.


  But Charles Schwab Corp gained 1.9% after it received an anti-trust approval from the Department of Justice for its purchase of TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. TD Ameritrade rose 5.1%.


  Declining issues slightly outnumbered advancers on the NYSE and the Nasdaq.


  The S&P index recorded 13 new 52-week highs and no new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 46 new highs and seven new lows. (Reporting by Devik Jain and Shreyashi Sanyal in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta, Sagarika Jaisinghani and Uttaresh.V)

Integration of TBS biometrics with a variety of third-party access control systems is easy. A "middleware" subsystem is connected to the network. Readers are connected to the subsystem and also to the corporate access control system. An interface with the TBS subsystem coordinates with the access control system. For example, a thermal camera used as part of the biometric reader can override the green light of the access control system if a high temperature (suggesting COVID-19 infection, for example) is detected.

In the long run, the cities will almost certainly bounce back, because in the long run, the cities always seem to bounce back. No matter how unlikely that may seem at the moment. Rome endured through centuries of plague and sackings, even though for some time its population diminished to the point where goats were grazed and vineyards planted inside the Aurelian walls. It’s now bigger than ever. Individual cities can fall, or even vanish, but over the course of human history, The City has only grown, despite the predictions of countless generations of pastoral fantasists.

The local library is taking advantage of the opportunity and will be distributing materials through curbside service beginning at 9 a.m. Monday at the main branch at 700 S. Otsego Ave. in Gaylord.
 The library has been closed to the public since March 16, but offered curbside service for a week before the initial stay-at-home order was implemented March 24 and then extended several times.
 "It was very heavily used when available in March," said Jackie Skinner, library director, in an email.
 To restart the service, Skinner said, “On Monday, we will begin by calling all the patrons that have items on hold and ask if they still would like them. We will then make an appointment for pickup. When they pull up to the front of the library, they can call us, and we will run items out to them. If a patron doesn’t have a cellphone, they can give a description of their car and a time of arrival and we will keep an eye out for them.
 “Any patron who would like particular items may also call in a request, and if the item is available we will make an appointment for pickup,” she added.
 Patrons can request anything in the library’s collection, including books, DVDs, books on CD, “anything we have on the shelf,” Skinner said.
 She also noted that newly returned items would be quarantined three days before being released again into circulation.
 Curbside service hours are from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday and Tuesday; 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. Wednesday; 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Thursday and Friday; 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday; and closed on Sunday. For more information or to request library items, call (989) 732-5841.
 Also, the library’s Facebook page posted the summer reading program will begin Monday as “bingo bags” are ready for pickup during curbside hours.
 The bags contain activities for all ages — preschoolers, kindergarten through sixth-graders, teens and adults. “Complete the activities in your bag. Cross off the squares on your Bingo card and return it to the library to enter to win prizes at the end of summer,” the post reads.
 As for the Otsego County Sportsplex, some areas of the building will remain off-limits despite reopening to the public.
 The facility, located at 1250 Gornick Ave. in Gaylord, is scheduled to reopen June 12, but Bill Michaels, Sportsplex executive director, said the swimming pool and ice rink will probably stay shut down.

This is by far the best espresso machine under the $100 price point that I tried. Despite its modest price, the Mr. Coffee ECMP50 surprised me by belting out satisfying espresso shots. They were nice and strong, with good crema and balanced coffee flavour. I will say, though, that I still prefer shots brewed by the Breville Barista Express and Cuisinart EM-100, which offer a more intense taste. Frothing and steaming milk to the proper temperature on this machine was difficult compared to those products due to its short frother arm. Mr. Coffee doesn't bundle a milk pitcher either, so you'll have to supply one yourself. That said, if $100 is your price limit, this budget espresso machine -- which still has necessities like a removable drip tray and 40-oz water reservoir -- should fit the bill for your cup of the day.

Jeni Mason has been named Principal of the Year for Region 2, by the Alaska Association of Secondary School Principals. She is principal of Cantwell School, Anderson School, and Denali PEAK correspondence school.


  This is the third time she has received the award.


  Mason surprised her colleagues at a recent Zoom meeting by showing up dressed as Batwoman, complete with black mask and a Batman/Batwoman logo in the background.


  “I got what I was striving for,” she said. “Smiles.”


  She made a habit of changing her virtual background for school district Zoom meetings every day during the covid pandemic this spring - from a giant photo of homemade salsa and tacos on May 5 to a table full of vegetables chopped up for the family’s pet bearded dragon.


  “Jeni always gives her all to the kids, parents, and staff throughout the entire district to help our kids become the best learners and people they can be,” said Denali School Superintendent Dan Polta. “It is great to see her recognized for that dedication by her peers in our region and across the state of Alaska. We are all very proud of her and glad she’s a member of our district family.”

“A month ago, it was nurses, doctors and golf pros and we couldn’t do anything wrong,” he said. “Not so much anymore — back to normal.”


  The principal source of consternation, a concern shared mostly by serious not casual golfers, is new health guidelines that have affected the golf hole itself. In an effort to reduce high-touch surfaces from golfers reaching into holes to retrieve their balls or removing the flagstick, course operators have tried various solutions, including raising the white liner cup, which is normally inserted in the hole, to about 2 inches above the green surface. An approaching ball bounces off the cup liner instead of falling into the hole.


  The United States Golf Association, a national governing body, issued a temporary rule amendment in March that qualified such a situation as a holed shot — with caveats (more on that later).

"They are a key element in our city's economy and they've been hit very hard by the pandemic," Tory said Thursday. "And I know that Toronto residents miss having a meal or having a drink at their favourite spots, especially as summer approaches and especially, of course, on our beloved patios in such a short patio season that we do have."


  The mayor said he believes restaurants and bars may reopen as part of Stage 2 of the pandemic reopening plan, and he didn't rule out the possibility that patios may be back in business sooner than dine-in areas as COVID-19 is considered less likely to spread outdoors.


  An exact date for the launch of Stage 2 has yet to be announced by the provincial government.


  Deputy Mayor Michael Thompson said the city has 8,000 restaurants, 660 outdoor sidewalk cafes on public property and 542 on private property.


  CafeTO will allow restaurant owners to open or expand patios by identifying public right-of-way for use as outdoor dining and drinking spaces, and fast tracking the permit process for sidewalk cafes and parklets.


  Guidelines will be available shortly for the new patio spaces, likely to go into downtown and mid-town locations, although suburban areas of the city are eligible to apply too.


  "It will help us recover from the economic gut punch that we received and other cities have received as a result of COVID-19," Thompson said.


  Tory said the plan is to waive all additional fees, subject to city council approval.


  The mayor said he also supports a halt to commercial evictions as the 'for lease' signs popping up all over the city are proof that many landlords are not taking advantage of a federal-provincial program to protect small businesses that can't afford their rent during the pandemic.


  The voluntary Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance (CECRA) would see government compensate landlords for half the rent if they waived 25%.


  The remaining 25% of the rent would still have to be paid by the commercial tenant.


  Premier Doug Ford has warned that he would get tough on landlords if they didn't play ball.


  "I think the time for the hardball has come," Tory said.

"Dangerous MOBS of far-left groups are running through our streets and causing absolute mayhem," the text of one ad running nationwide on the platform reads. "They are DESTROYING our cities and rioting—it’s absolute madness." The ad goes on to point the finger at Antifa, a nebulous "anti- fascist" group known for punching Nazis and otherwise getting physical in response to white supremacist and neo-Nazi agitators. But the president uses the loosely defined group, whose use of violence is widely condemned on the left, as a boogyman to paint the peaceful demonstrators as violent and distract from the disturbing and documented violence perpetrated by some police officers on protesters and journalists. (On Monday, Twitter took down a supposed Antifa account urging violence when it discovered it was actually the work of a white supremacist group.) On Facebook, Trump's campaign has made Antifa a key word in it ads this week.

The country’s construction industry, which mirrors the economy, is expected to take a huge blow from the extended lockdown clamped to check the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic.


  Rating agency CRISIL in a report titled _Construction industry hits a wall_ explains how the lockdown has compounded India’s growth woes.


  Along with external risks such as weak global demand, supply disruptions, and global financial shocks, the economy now faces factory shutdowns, reduced discretionary spending, and delayed capex cycle.


  A CRISIL research analysis indicates a 12-16 per cent contraction in construction investments for the industry this fiscal to ₹7.3 lakh crore from ₹8.6 lakh crore in fiscal 2020.


  The estimate factors lower capex by Central and State governments due to diversion of funds towards healthcare, public welfare and social obligations. This, at a time when their finances are already strained and gross budgetary support to infrastructure, is expected to decline due to lower revenue receipts.


  Budgetary allocation to infrastructure by the Ccentral government for fiscal 2021, is lower compared with fiscal 2020. It also factors the lockdown impacting construction activity and movement of labour in the first half of fiscal 2021. With construction activities deferred, players in the construction sector are expected to log a 13-17 per cent drop in revenue in fiscal 2021. The EBITDA margins are also estimated at 4-6 per cent for the fiscal, down from 7-9 per cent expected in the preceding one.


  With the continuing lockdown, labour issues and supply chain disruptions, the report states the current quarter will be a washout. The government has allowed construction of roads in rural belts and irrigation and renewable energy projects in virus-free zones or regions from April 20.


  However, construction companies face challenges in arranging transportation and accommodation for labour, maintaining social distancing at construction sites, obtaining clearances from district officials for intra- and inter- district projects, and ensuring raw material availability.


  Industries such as transportation, quarrying, steel, cement and forging need to be up and running for meeting the raw material requirements of the construction sector. Add to this the workforce issues and the need to have permits and clearances in place before construction can resume, the sector is likely to take some time to return to normalcy even after the lockdown is lifted.


  The bulk of construction activity, therefore, will likely resume only in the third quarter this fiscal, according to the update.

  Emma Watson has always been one of Hollywood’s most open-minded stars, at the forefront of all atrocities. However, she recently came under fire after her social media feed was accused of lacking the correct information needed in order to appropriately support #BlackoutTuesday.


  The issue arose after Emma reportedly failed to share appropriate words in reference to the matter at hand and instead edited the black square picture to go with her feed.

At a time when public-spirited Coloradans should be rallying together to help our state’s businesses get back into high gear, “progressive” Democrats at the state Capitol are instead practicing opportunism at its worst by slapping a fresh coat of paint on their pre-COVID agenda.


  Just over two months ago, Colorado’s political leaders made a difficult choice that jeopardized the financial stability of its residents to save lives that were vulnerable to coronavirus. Those choices are water under the bridge, so we should charitably presume that officials acted in good faith to choose the lesser of two evils.


  Still, nearly 500,000 Coloradans have lost their jobs, lifting unemployment to a record high. Some unemployed workers have no jobs to return to because their employers are out of business for good. Economists predict a 25 percent reduction in tax revenues to state government, reflecting an unprecedented collapse in real-world commerce.

The idea of keeping schools closed in the fall because of safety concerns for children might be "a bit of a reach," said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. In a phone interview with CNN Wednesday, Fauci noted that children tend to have milder symptoms or even no symptoms when they are infected with Covid-19. What's not yet clear is whether children get infected as frequently as adults, and whether they often pass the infection on to others. Ultimately, he said, the decision to reopen schools needs to be predicated on the level of infection in each community. (Grayer, 6/3)

MLB’s first offer of 82 games was going to invite asterisks. But at least it is half a season. Being in first place at roughly the traditional All-Star break feels relevant, if incomplete. Teams reach 50 games at about Memorial Day, normally the first pitstop to assess the season, not determine everything from ERA titles to championships.

But you have to stop and remember, folks, that there’s a heck of a lot of the American population that is not anywhere near up to speed like you and I. It’s a shame, but they’re not. It’s still a fact that there’s decent size percentage of the population that only knows what they see on things like CNN or their local news or MSNBC or what they read in their newspaper. It doesn’t matter the New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, USA Today, the Washington Post, it’s all one, it’s all the same stuff.

Another rally took place in Union Square at around 7pm. The entire march took the streets but was peaceful. Periodically some marchers would pause and graffiti buildings. Whenever it walked past a bus the bus drivers would honk in solidarity without fail. Some car drivers would honk too, although there was one driver of a BMW who was heckling the protesters.

La lettera sara distribuita domenica con il settimanale diocesano  "La Voce e il Tempo" e raggiungera tutti i destinatari a cui e indirizzata attraverso i canali della Caritas. Nosiglia si rivolge a chi ha fatto fatica a stare a casa perche una casa non ce l'ha. "In molti avete trovato rifugio nei dormitori che sono stati aperti anche per l'intero giorno, qualcuno ha potuto godere della accoglienza di qualche parrocchia durante il giorno, in molti avete trovato il cibo nelle mense pur se con modalita piu spicce e meno accoglienti. Qualcuno non e riuscito a trovare posto o magari non se l'e sentita di accettare l'invito. La strada sara un poco piu in salita ma e ancora nelle vostre possibilita percorrerla. Noi cercheremo di rimuovere le pietre che possono fare da inciampo, o almeno ci proveremo".

Maybe I'll start and I'll hand it to Rod for more detailed balance sheet comments. But if you look at our strategy, Mario, it's a strategy of driving a premium ROE, and we've invested in businesses and in customer franchises and geographic expansion that allows us to drive a premium ROE strategy. And we're not moving away from that. We still think our collection of client franchises businesses, our scale and diversification, technology investments and competitive advantage there allows us to drive a premium ROE in the marketplace, and that continues to be our medium-term objective and will be how we manage this organization going forward.
