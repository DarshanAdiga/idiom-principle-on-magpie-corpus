LONDON (AP) — A British judge will decide Monday whether a tabloid newspaper defamed Johnny Depp by calling him a “wife beater,” a ruling with huge implications for the careers of both Depp and former spouse Amber Heard. Justice Andrew Nicol is due to deliver his judgement in writing, three months after the end of a trial that exposed stark details of the Hollywood couple’s tempestuous marriage. There will be no in-person hearing because of the coronavirus pandemic. Depp sued News Group Newspapers, publisher of The Sun, and the newspaper’s executive editor, Dan Wootton, at London’s High Court over an April 2018 article that accused him of assaulting Heard, an actress whose films include “Justice League” and “Aquaman.\" Both Depp and Heard spent several days in the witness box during the three-week trial in July, giving irreconcilable accounts of their volatile relationship. The pair met on the set of 2011 comedy “The Rum Diary” and married in Los Angeles in 2015. They separated the following year and divorced in 2017. Heard, 34, testified as the main witness for the defense, saying Depp turned into a violent alter ego he dubbed the “Monster” when under the influence of alcohol and drugs. She alleged 14 separate incidents between 2013 and 2016 in which he hit, slapped and shoved her, pulled her hair and threw bottles at her. The alleged assaults took place in glamorous settings including the couple’s luxury penthouse, Depp’s private island in the Bahamas and an executive jet. Depp, 57, branded he allegations “sick” and a “hoax” and claimed Heard was the aggressor during their relationship. He claimed that Heard hit him, even severing the tip of his finger with a thrown vodka bottle during an altercation in Australia during filming of a “Pirates of the Caribbean” movie. Depp...

She also revealed that Eijaz would feel lonely and to make him feel better, she has also sent him home-cooked food. However, she still does not consider him as a friend. Eijaz and Kavita continue to argue and eventually irk Salman.Up next, an activity is introduced wherein the housemates have to tag their fellow contestants with the emotions they most resonate with. Nikki gets to choose who invokes the feeling of ‘Prem’ for which she elects Jaan. Abhinav is asked to choose the contestant who elicits ‘Krodh’ in him, and he chooses Rahul. Rubina tags Pavitra as the contestant who constantly surprises her and she is unsure whether to trust her or not. Pavitra, on the other hand, tags Kavita as someone who she finds disgusting.On a lighter note, Shehnaz Gill enters the Bigg Boss house and interacts with Salman. They both reminise about the good old days. Shehnaz also decides to play cupid in the house and plays a ‘Prem ka Game’ with Eijaz and Pavitra! At the end of the game, she concludes that there is a strong connection between the duo and decides to send them on a romantic date.

The teams’ outlooks for the 2020 presidential race stand at odds with widespread polling that shows the Democratic challenger, former Vice President Joe Biden, out in front generally by significant margins.
 One team used internet and social media searches to gauge interest in the candidate. The other team tweaked an established forecasting system, which is based on economic data and incumbency, by also evaluating a candidate’s charisma.
 “I did feel, seriously, like an idiot being about the sole person on the planet, perhaps one or two other research teams, that also said they think Trump would win [in 2016],” says John Antonakis, professor of organisational behavior at the University of Lausanne. Antonakis, together with and Philippe Jacquart, professor at Emlyon business school in France, predicted the election based on the candidate’s charisma. “I really thought that we had gotten something fundamentally wrong.”
 ## The problem with the polls
 Both groups of researchers say polling, the traditional questioning of likely voters, faces several hurdles in gaining an accurate picture of the electorate. They cite several issues, including difficulty in contacting a representative sample of voters because of the move from land lines to mobile phones; the fact that responders may not answer truthfully; and the fact that people who are polled may not vote.
 “These are serious statisticians,” Antonakis says of the pollsters, “but they have a very wicked problem to solve.”

The stock, which has been on a strong uptrend since March, showed signs of weakness during the week before last week. Following this, the stock weakened and broke below an important support of ₹1,100 last Tuesday and wrapped up the week at ₹1,060.6.
 This has opened the door for further decline. So, in the short term, the stock could trade with a bearish bias. Corroborating the negative outlook, the moving average convergence divergence indicator on the daily chart has turned the trajectory downward and it shows considerable downward momentum and the daily relative strength index has been declining in tandem with the price.
 So, traders can initiate fresh short positions on rallies with a stop-loss at ₹1,100. From the current level, ₹1,025 is the immediate support. At this level liesthe 61.8 per cent Fibonacci retracement level, making it a significant base.
 Below that level is the psychological level of ₹1,000. On the upside, ₹1,100-1,115 can be a resistance band.

Elite lawyers like many of my classmates — with their liberal politesse — are not motivated by their supposed values, but by their ambition. For this reason, they will normalize and in fact celebrate anyone who rises to the highest levels of power. They will cheer on the private and government attorneys who raise the most inhumane arguments, mostly admiring the fact that they brought those arguments to the Supreme Court. They will line up to write opinion pieces in support of judges who will most certainly dismantle civil rights protections — if those judges happen to have employed them. Big law firms will welcome back with open arms the architects of some of the darkest policies in recent U.S. history, rewarding them with salaries many times larger than those of lawyers who choose to let their values guide them.

Bloomberg) -- Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union plans to meet in January as the party prepares to select the leader who will take it into next year’s elections.
 Three candidates are competing for prime position to replace Merkel, who will step down as chancellor after 16 years running Europe’s largest economy. Germany’s ruling party had originally planned to stage an in-person convention on Dec. 4, but delayed it as coronavirus infections surge. The country will start a one-month partial lockdown on Monday.
 The assembly of about 1,000 delegates will take place in the middle of January in person and can be divided into regional chapters or held as virtual meeting as a last resort should infections continue to rise, Secretary General Paul Ziemiak said in a tweet. The announcement came after party leader Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer warned on Saturday that the ongoing internal haggling over the party convention could backfire for the ruling party.
 The move should reassure Friedrich Merz, a longtime Merkel rival who is one of the favorites and opposed delaying the meeting. The conservative politician has accused some of trying to sideline him at a time when his popularity has been rising among the party’s rank and file even though he’s relatively unpopular among the broader electorate. The 64-year-old was pushed out of the CDU inner circle by Merkel nearly two decades ago.
 Armin Laschet, the moderate leader of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, has been pushing to postpone the meeting, which could give him time to lift his profile and to respond to Merz’s challenge. Norbert Roettgen, chairman of the foreign policy committee in the Bundestag lower house of parliament, is also running.
 The extended leadership battle reflects badly on the CDU, which is largely in charge of the country’s pandemic response. A poll published Saturday by the Forsa institute showed the CDU and its coalition partners lost one percentage point while opposition parties gained the same amount. The CDU coalition maintained its lead with 35% in the poll.

It is a conversation that has been on for a long time and it will continue for a very long time. It started before independence. Our leaders went to London many times; Zik, Awolowo and the Sardauna between 1957 and 1959 to talk about the sort of government we will have at independence. Awolowo made it clear that we will only be part of Nigeria after independence if it was going to be a federal government, that there must be a true federation that will give the ethnic groups considerable autonomy to be themselves while remaining loyal to the centre. At the beginning, Zik was for a unitary government, but later he saw that we are too big and complex to be run as a unitary state and at the end of the day, they agreed to a true federation. At independence, the younger generation may not know that every region had its own construction. There were four constitutional documents at independence-federal constitution, western, eastern and northern regions. Every region was a government, not an underling of the federal government. Of course, the federal took precedence over all of them. But each of them was a government with its own constitution, police, coat of arms and armour bearer, it had its own ambassador. That is what we negotiated and got. The military came and scrapped that. In doing so, they scrapped the consensus that was the covenant on which Nigeria is built. No matter what we do, until we return to consensus we are wasting our time.

It is when you are planning that you look at the needs of all you are trying to do. Any President should know that a plan is a major instrument in his hands for knowing what is going on, for controlling what is going on and for influencing the development of the economy. There is no other instrument. It is the plan that he gives to his ministers. For instance, the Minister of Education, read that plan. You duty is to implement it, faithfully, on target and if you have any problems, you come back. These days, the Executive appoints ministers and commissioners at state level. What do you give to guide them? Nothing! He goes to his ministry and the civil servants talk to you about what they were doing before. The question is, what they were doing last year, should they be doing it this year? Did it work well last year? Did it help the people of Nigeria? Who is assessing the impact of what they are doing on the live of Nigerians. It is planning that helps you look at all that. This thing that we have been doing for 10 years, is it delivering the services we expect? Is it improving the lives of Nigerians? It is critical analysis. If not, you need to abandon it and face something else. But there is no review of that kind. Planning brings all that on board. My recommendation is that we need a serious multi-year plan, at least five years. There is what we call perspective, which is between 10 and 20 years. Those are very skeletal kind of projections. You project macro economical aggregate for over 10 years. That was my job when I was in government. No ministry or department can just wake up one day and change the plan. There is a process for plan modification or plan amendment. It is a rigorous process. These days, a contractor goes to a governor or a minister and sells an idea to him. I see an example here in Akure, Ondo State. If you go to the major roads, you find elaborate bus stops, but we have no bus service in Akure. No buses are using those stops, why are they there? Because a contractor persuaded the government that they should build those bus stops and that will raise the contract amount and enable whoever is handling it to have a bigger cut. That is a classic example. Bus stops without a bus service!

Bloomberg) -- The Lion Electric Co., a maker of electric vehicles such as yellow school buses, is in talks to go public through a merger with blank- check firm Northern Genesis Acquisition Corp., according to people with knowledge of the matter.
 Northern Genesis has begun discussions with prospective investors about raising a targeted $500 million in new equity to support a transaction, said some of the people, who requested anonymity because the talks are private.
 The merged entity is set to be valued at $2 billion or more, one of the people said. As with all deals that aren’t yet finalized, it’s possible terms could change and talks could collapse.
 A representative for Lion Electric declined to comment. A representative for Northern Genesis didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
 The Quebec-based company said in September that it’ll deliver 10 battery electric trucks to Amazon.com Inc., a move that will help the e-commerce giant to reduce its carbon emissions.
 Power Sustainable Capital, a subsidiary of Power Corp. of Canada, is Lion’s largest shareholder.
 Battery-makers and other companies in the electric vehicle space have flocked toward SPACs for capital. At least five have agreed to go public by merging with a special purpose acquisition company, including Nikola corp and Fisker Inc.

Bloomberg) -- Nobby Stiles, a member of the team that won England’s only soccer World Cup title in 1966, has died. He was 78.
 Stiles died peacefully after a long illness, according to a family statement on Friday. He’d been suffering from dementia for the past four years and was earlier diagnosed with prostate cancer.
 For millions of soccer fans, Stiles will always be remembered for his gap- toothed victory jig after England’s 4-2 win against West Germany in the July 1966 final at London’s Wembley Stadium. As he told the Guardian newspaper in 2002, “kids of my grandkids’ age, they come up to me and go: ‘Hey, you, you’re the fella with no teeth who danced round Wembley, aren’t you?’”
 Tributes poured in from players past and present, including 1966 teammate Geoff Hurst, who described Stiles as the “heart and soul of the team.” Gary Lineker, top scorer at the 1986 tournament, said he had a heart that was “even bigger than the gap in his teeth.”
 Stiles also won a European Cup and two English League titles during an 11-year stint at his local club Manchester United. His former club and international teammate Bobby Charlton is the only other English player to claim winners’ medals at both the World Cup and the European Cup.
 Born during an air raid in 1942, Norbert Peter Stiles grew up a United fan and used to regularly watch the team at Old Trafford. Despite his short stature -- he was 5-foot-6 -- and poor eyesight, the team signed him as an apprentice at age 15. Three years later, he made his debut against Bolton Wanderers.
 Known for his tough tackling and man-marking, and nicknamed the Toothless Tiger, Stiles played in central midfield to restrict the creativity of opponents and gain possession for more attacking teammates such as Charlton.
 He missed a first chance to claim a trophy with United as manager Matt Busby omitted him from the 1963 F.A. Cup final winning team against Leicester. It was the club’s first trophy since the 1958 Munich air disaster, in which eight players died.
 In 1965, after establishing himself as a regular on the team, Stiles helped United end an eight-year wait for the league title.
 England Debut
 In October that year, Stiles made the first of his 28 England appearances in a 2-2 draw against Scotland at Wembley. The 0-0 tie against Uruguay in England’s opening World Cup game was his 15th appearance and he retained his place throughout the tournament.
 In the semifinals he successfully shackled Portugal’s play-maker and star Eusebio as England won 2-1 -- Charlton scoring both goals -- to reach the final. After England’s victory in the final he did his famous dance, with the World Cup -- known as the Jules Rimet trophy -- in one hand and his false teeth in the other.
 Stiles played in England’s next four games, though was dropped after a defeat against Scotland in 1967. He made an appearance at the 1968 European Championship, played one game the following year, and his international career ended in 1970.
 At club level, Stiles gained a second League championship medal in 1967 and won the European Cup in 1968. He was again given the task of stopping Benfica’s Eusebio as United won 4-1 in the final to become the first English champion of Europe’s premier club competition.
 Canada, West Brom
 Stiles, who played 392 games for United, was sold to Middlesbrough in 1971 and two years later joined Preston. He was the club’s manager from 1977 until 1981, when he resumed playing at age 39 with the Vancouver Whitecaps of the North American Soccer League.
 In September 1985 he started a 21-match spell in charge at West Brom, though was fired five months later after the team won only three games. Stiles later worked as a youth coach at United from 1989 to 1993.
 Stiles was among the final five players from the 1966 team to be made Members of the Order of the British Empire, or MBEs. Alan Ball, Roger Hunt, Ray Wilson and George Cohen also received the honor in 2000.
 In 2010, Stiles sold his World Cup and European Cup winners’ medals at auction to raise money for his family. Manchester United paid 209,000 pounds for them both.

WASHINGTON -- Donald Trump's hold on the Republican Party is something few could have imagined when he launched what seemed an unlikely bid for the 2016 nomination.
 But even if Trump loses reelection Tuesday, his grip on the GOP is now strong enough that it could take some time before the party figures out a path forward.
 "I do not think this is a party that is ready to grapple with what it's been doing or reassess itself anytime soon," said GOP consultant Brendan Buck, who worked for the past two Republican House speakers and does not support Trump.
 Trump's takeover of the GOP was swift. While he was front and center during the 2016 primary debates, Trump was initially slow to consolidate support. Even as late as the convention, the possibility of a floor fight loomed over his nomination.
 Once Trump was elected, however, he reshaped the party in his image and GOP officeholders have been judged - by him and by voters - primarily on their loyalty to the president.
 "Until that changes," Buck said, "it's going to be hard to have a real conversation about changing who we are as a party."
 That's despite the fact that the headlines have been filled with former GOP officeholders who reject Trump - even as the party's base remains passionate about the president.
 Ninety-five percent of Republicans approve of how Trump is doing his job, a figure similar to George W. Bush's standing before his 2004 re-election, according to Gallup.
 But Trump has generally been viewed much less favorably than Bush was among independents and Democrats in the months leading up the election.
 Loss of older voters, women
 Some of the worst erosion has been among older voters, those with a college education and women.
 Such changes could force a long-term political realignment, according to William A. Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who worked in the Clinton administration. Voters who are breaking their ties with the GOP to back Democratic challenger Joe Biden could make a temporary move permanent if they like what they see in a Biden presidency.
 "This could be an extremely significant election in that regard because that would mean a shift in the plate tectonics of politics in the United States," Galston said. "This could be a big one."
 One group of former Republicans who are giving up on reshaping the party is the Lincoln Project, which has run some of the toughest ads against Trump as well as gone after Senate Republicans on the ballot.
 "There are a lot of folks who might be very interested in rebuilding the Republican Party," said Reed Galen, a co-founder of the Lincoln Project who worked for President George W. Bush and Arizona Sen. John McCain. "We are not them."
 Galen sees the Lincoln Project as being a "coalition partner" with a Biden administration.
 "If you want to get the country healthy and back to work and back to school, it's going to take a broad-based, bipartisan, nationwide effort to make it happen," he said. "To the extent that we can be helpful to a President Biden in that regard, we want to do that."
 The Lincoln Project gleefully tweeted recently that its 2.6 million followers had surpassed the Republican National Committee's 2.5 million.
 To Republicans like Buck, that just proves the group won't have a voice at the conservative table.
 "I think they are a bunch of guys who are effectively leading a Democratic political organization and their followers are Democrats who are happy to see them take out Republicans for them," he said.
 Can Trump supporters and Never Trumpers co-exist?
 In fact, it's not clear whether conservatives who have pushed back against Trump and the changes he's brought to the party are a significant force, said Vanessa Williamson, co-author of "The Tea Party and the Remaking of Republican Conservatism."
 "The question I think that remains open is how much support those individuals have either institutionally or in terms of voter support," Williamson said during a recent discussion at the Brookings Institution, where she is a senior fellow. "It is not, I think, at the level where I would describe it as a faction, even, for the Republican Party, in terms of its level of organization or power within the party."
 At the conservative American Enterprise Institute, scholar Yuval Levin has been bringing together policy advisers to politicians to discuss how to change what conservatives are offering voters.
 Levin, who worked on domestic policy for Bush, was among those arguing "well before Trumpism" that base tenants of Reaganism - lowering taxes and letting market forces rule - that drove the party for many years are not delivering for working families.
 "That's very much a debate within the right," he said. "I think that Republican politicians still are deeply perplexed about what happened in 2016."
 Similarly, a new think tank, the American Compass, is trying to make it clear that "post-Trumpism needs to be very different from pre-Trumpism."
 "Trump just proved wrong virtually everything that the right-of-center thought it knew about what its politicians were supposed to be saying, what it's constituents actually cared about," said executive director Oren Cass, a former adviser to Sen. Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign.
 Cass argues conservative public policy became too dominated by libertarian impulses, a hands-off approach that has left a lot of needs unaddressed.
 "We see a much more substantial role for public policy to play in making the market work well," he said.
 A big tent?
 In order to recalibrate, Republicans will have to first wander in the wilderness, said Sarah Longwell, founder of Republicans for the Rule of Law and Defending Democracy Together.
 "It comes down to how tight a grip does Donald Trump retain on the party," she said. "Because one of the things that's really important to understand about Donald Trump is that he cares less about beating Democrats than he does about owning the Republican Party."
 For that reason, Longwell thinks voters have to "absolutely annihilate" Republicans on Nov. 3.
 But the groups she leads aren't actively working to defeat any Republicans except Trump, as the Lincoln Project is.
 For Defending Democracy Together's $30 million campaign aimed at giving Republicans the "permission" to vote against Trump through testimonials of Republicans who are doing just that, Longwell wanted as big a tent as possible.
 "Ninety percent of the people in our project explicitly endorse Biden and are probably going to vote straight ticket," she said. "But lots of others might not. And we wanted to have a project that gave everybody in that space a home."
 John Pudner, a former adviser to Romney who supports Trump, said the "Never Trumpers" lost credibility with rank-and-file Republicans when they started going after senators.
 "I just don't see how a conservative thinks we're better off with every branch being controlled by Democrats," he said.
 Tom Nichols, a senior adviser to the Lincoln Project, said it's laughable to argue that Republicans should keep the Senate to serve as a check-and-balance on Democrats, if they lose the White House.
 "I don't remember, over 40 years, anybody ever saying, `Now we're on the verge of a landslide…but we'd better leave some Democrats in power so that we don't go crazy," said Nichols, author of "The Death of Expertise."
 And since it's "pretty rare for parties to die," he said, the most likely future is some kind of reconstituted Republican Party.
 "But it needs to have new people in it," he added.
 Even if Trump loses, it's impossible to predict what things will feel like after Nov. 3, Levin said.
 But, soon enough, he said, "these conversations will be happening everywhere on the right."
 "I mean," Levin added, "it will be all we have to do."

Tezos recovered modestly after dropping to lowest level in nearly 7months. Technical indicators on the daily chart showa lack of bullish momentum. Tezos could target $2.5 if it manages to clear $2-2.2 area. Tezos (XTZ) closed the first five days of the week in the red and touched its lowest level since early April at $1.7969 on Friday. Although XTZ erased a small portion of its weekly losses on Saturday and gained more than 4%, it seems to be having a difficult time preserving its bullish momentum on Sunday. As of writing, XTZ was down nearly 1% on the day at $1.9650. XTZ technical outlook If Tezos climbs above $2 (psychological level), the price could encounter stiff resistance at $2.2 (20-day SMA/50-day SMA/descending resistance line coming from October October 13th). A daily close above that level could open the door for additional gains toward $2.5, where the Fibonacci 23.6% retracement of August-September downtrend is located. However, the RSI indicator on the daily chart remains in the bearish territory near 40 and doesn't show a bullish divergence yet, suggesting that buyers haven't yet committed to a convincing rebound. On the other hand, the initial support could be seen at $1.8 (multi-month low) ahead of $1.65 (April 6 low) and $1.45 (static support area from April). Tezos daily chart
