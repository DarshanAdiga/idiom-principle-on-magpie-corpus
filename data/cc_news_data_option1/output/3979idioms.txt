While it is encouraging that Long Islanders are witnessing the economic resilience of our downtowns, we are still just learning what the long-term impacts of the coronavirus will be on suburban real estate markets and land- use policy. While there is no denying the longstanding need for more housing options on Long Island, municipalities must not jump the gun by blindly allowing more development. Instead, we must take a more measured approach to growth that balances both the region’s economic and environmental needs. This includes thoughtfully targeting redevelopment efforts in key areas where the appropriate supportive infrastructure is in place, adapting preexisting commercial properties to meet the needs of the 21st century worker, and ensuring the continued preservation of our open spaces. One of the most powerful lessons that the pandemic has taught us is the enduring value of our communities. With thoughtful planning and study, we can ensure that future generations benefit from the lessons we’ve learned from the coronavirus.

Four games into the season we haven't seen that same type of reckless aggression, and that's pretty standard. I can't recall seeing any special teams fakes. I can't recall seeing any wild trick plays. There's a reason why I discount those wins that come once your season is irrelevant. You're playing with house money at a certain point. If you're a bad team under a first year head coach with reasonable job security, there's really no reason to be afraid of losing. Once you're already a bad team an additional loss doesn't really hurt your cause. If you lose doing something aggressive, nobody cares. You were expected to lose anyway. Your decisions weren't under a microscope. But a win can do a whole lot to lend credit to your cause, so coaches pull out all the stops to do so. The benefits of winning far outweigh the almost non- existent costs of losing, so its almost a no-brainer. And while I'm speaking for these specific coaching decisions, it also has an effect on players to play with house money and with less pressure.

The acquisition of this land is another testament to Missouri’s long and proud heritage of conservation. A significant portion of the purchase price back in 2016 came from a lead company bankruptcy that we chased all the way to Texas. As part of that matter, we worked with the federal government to clean up lead contamination and acquire new park lands to compensate for the land the company had ruined.
 Acquiring this land for a state park was not a unilateral decision. The federal court prescribed the use of the trust funds set aside by the lead company’s bankruptcy, and federal partners approved the expenditure of the trust funds in accordance with the court’s mandates. The Oregon County judge gave no consideration to these complex legal realities.
 The Eleven Point is one of our nation’s greatest wild rivers, and it is a priceless gem of our rich natural heritage as Missourians. Coveted by paddlers for the backcountry experience and anglers for the Blue-Ribbon rainbow trout fishery, the Eleven Point belongs to all of us.
 As Missourians, we need to fight for the legacy of our state park system and take this case to the Court of Appeals immediately. Recently, the Missouri Supreme Court unanimously overturned a local decision that deer on hunting preserves are “livestock” instead of “wildlife” to be managed professionally by the Missouri Department of Conservation. Correcting bad decisions is the role of the courts, not managing deer or parks.
 On the day Missourians voted to elect President Donald Trump with 57% of the ballot, 81% of the voters overwhelmingly reapproved the Parks, Soil and Water Conservation Sales Tax to ensure strong and reliable funding for our unparalleled state park system.
 Missourians must rally once again to protect our parks from short-sighted judicial activism. Rangers — not judges — should run our parks.

Manchester United and Liverpool were both handed devastating Premier League beatings today, and could well challenge Arsenal for their key targets.
 If you didn’t already know, tomorrow (Monday October 5) will be deadline day for Premier League teams, and Arsenal amongst many of our rivals appear to have unfinished business.
 We are believed to be desperate to bring in a midfield star to bolster our midfield, with Thomas Partey and Houssem Aouar strongly linked throughout the summer, while Jorginho is a deal which appears more likely at present.
 While we are keen to bring in a top player to bring us closer to our rivals, we may well be joined by Chelsea in their bid to shore up their options, but with both Manchester United, Manchester City and Liverpool have all had their weaknesses exposed this weekend.
 The Red Devils were downed 6-1 at Old Trafford, with Tottenham duo Heung Min Son and Harry Kane embarrassing their whole side.
 City were the best team for the opening 25 minutes against Leeds, before the team found themselves very much on the backfoot for the remainder, and in turn were lucky to escape with a point, while Premier League champions were also utterly embarrassed by Aston Villa.
 These results could well force each of them to reassess their options, and I wouldn’t be surprised to find both Manchester teams and Chelsea in Madrid hoping to do a deal for Partey.
 We will no doubt have to have backup options in the works tomorrow, but with so many teams in desperate need in similar areas, we could well struggle to do what has been needed throughout the summer, and our failure to do the right business early in the window may be our downfall.
 Will Chelsea, United, City and maybe even Liverpool all be forced to bring in a new midfield option tomorrow? Would it makes sense for each side to be considering Partey?

"It is unfathomable that in the midst of a global pandemic which has killed more than 209,000 Americans, and left millions more sick and potentially facing lifelong side effects -- including the president of the United States -- that the US Department of Transportation would outright reject such a simple, science-backed, lifesaving measure," Transportation Trades Department President Larry Willis said in a statement on Saturday. "The DOT's decision is heartbreaking, and in light of yesterday's news, frankly, shocking."


  At a virtual town hall with the Amalgamated Transit Union on Saturday, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden said that the department "stupidly" rejected the petition and said that his administration would have better protections for workers.


  "You wear a mask to protect the person next to you," Biden said. " You wear a mask to protect the bus driver. You wear a mask to protect the person you're sitting next to on the bus. And to reject the chance to do the easiest thing possible to save lives, I find it appalling. I promise you my Department of Transportation will insist on it."


  Last month, when asked at an ABC News town hall about enacting a national mask mandate, Trump suggested that Biden should have enacted such a measure, despite the former vice president currently having no legislative powers to do so.

SAN BENEDETTO DEL TRONTO - Sono tutti minorenni i ragazzi che, nel tardo pomeriggio di ieri, hanno messo in atto nella zona di piazza Nardone, di fronte alla chiesa della Madonna della Marina. Prima hanno sfondato i finestrini di alcune auto in sosta e fatto razzia di oggetti negli abitacoli, poi hanno scippato un'anziana costringendola, tra l'altro, a dover ricorrere alla cure dei sanitari. E' tutto accaduto nel tardo pomeriggio di sabato, in piazza Nardone. Il gruppo di giovani ha prima operato all'interno del parcheggio sotterraneo che si trova sotto la piazza. Hanno mandato in frantumi i finestrini di alcune autovetture che si trovavano posteggiate tra gli stalli per rubare oggetti, di valore e non, all'interno. Quindi, proprio di fronte alla chiesa, hanno preso di mira una donna di 75 anni, che si trovava a passare di lì. L'anziana aveva una borsa con sé e loro hanno messo in atto uno scippo in piena regola. Per portargliela via l'hanno strattonata violentemente facendola cadere a terra e provocandole delle contusioni per le quali si è poi reso necessario l'intervento del 118. La donna è comunque stata subito soccorsa da altri ragazzi che si trovavano in piazza e che hanno assistito a tutta la scena. E sono stati proprio loro, all'arrivo della polizia del commissariato, a riferire agli agenti quanto accaduto riuscendo anche ad identificare quei ragazzi che sono stati tutti raggiunti dagli agenti e denunciati alla Procura dei Minori. Nessuno di loro ha infatti ancora raggiunto la maggiore età.

Patricia Beckford Acheson can empathize with the Secret Service detail protecting President Donald Trump.


  Acheson was among the first women assigned to the agency's permanent protection detail, spending more than three years protecting then-vice president George Bush Sr. in the early 1980s.


  "Our biggest fear was the lone assassin, but things have changed so much," the retired agent told USA TODAY. "Now they are dealing with organized terrorism and with COVID. The threats against a president nowadays are mind- boggling."


  Agents make safety recommendations that generally are accepted. If not, such as in the case of presidents exiting limousines to greet crowds, some kind of mutual accommodations usually are made. But the bottom line is that the president makes the call.


  "Ultimately, our job is not to say 'no,' it is to protect," Acheson said.


  Former Secret Service directors W. Ralph Basham and Lew Merletti say the White House medical office is responsible for providing advice and recommendations on the potential threat posed by disease and other health issues, which are then factored into the overall security plan. But Basham said the security and health challenge posed by the coronavirus is unprecedented.


  "We are in uncharted waters," said Basham, who served as director from 2003 to 2006. "We haven't seen anything like this before."


  And forget those made-for-TV moments where agents hustle a balking president into a bunker. They may push the president out of immediate harm's way, but longer-term decisions are subject to presidential approval. How well they are received often depends on the relationship between the president and his protective detail, former Secret Service director John Magaw says.


  "You have to be careful because you don't want to cry wolf, but you also want to be clear about any concerns you may have," Magaw said.


  Trump invited dozens of politicians and high-profile dignitaries to the White House Rose Garden on Sept. 26 to introduce Amy Coney Barrett as his pick to succeed the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the nation's high court. Many at the gathering did not wear masks, and social distancing was not apparent. Audience members sat in chairs packed next to each other, and some of those gathered exchanged hugs. Now, the president and at least seven others have tested positive for COVID-19.


  The Secret Service declined to comment.


  "I feel so badly because agents have a job and they are sworn to do it and they will do it," Acheson said. "But how do you protect someone from COVID?"


    Not just Trump: US records the most daily infections in nearly 2 months  


  Trump took a three-month hiatus from large public rallies starting in March. That ended with a rally in Tulsa on June 20. But the event drew a far-from- capacity crowd to the 19,000-seat BOK Center, and The New York Times, citing unnamed sources, said two Secret Service agents tested positive in Tulsa. Other campaign events featuring little or no social distancing have followed.


  "If he wants to do something, then we will do everything in our power to make sure that it can be done safely and securely," Magaw said. "The bottom line, it's his call."


  Ogbonnaya Omenka, an assistant professor who specializes in public health at Butler University's college of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, told USA TODAY that in an "ideal world" such gatherings would not take place in the current virus climate.


  "For any public gathering, maintaining the public health guidelines should be a top priority," he said. "However, no matter how sound the public health recommendations are, the key consideration lies in whether organizers ... adhere to them or not."


  While largely a responsibility for medical authorities, Basham said the virus could raise sensitive security questions for the Secret Service. Basham said that if the agency suspected, for example, that the president was ill with COVID-19 during a debate or other joint appearance with his Democratic rival, he said the service would likely have the obligation to take their concerns to the White House medical office so that Joe Biden - another service protectee - could be alerted to the potential risk.


  "These are very difficult situations to be in," Basham said.


  The Secret Service was originally founded to combat widespread counterfeiting of U.S. currency after the Civil War. In 1901, the agency was asked to begin its protective mission after the assassination of President William McKinley.


  Less than two decades later, the "Spanish flu" emerged in 1918. Much like Trump, then-president Woodrow Wilson downplayed it. And like Trump, Wilson became infected, contracting the illness shortly after arriving in Paris in April 1919. Sarah Fling, a fellow writing for the White House Historical Association, notes that a number of members of the Wilson entourage became ill during a transatlantic voyage in February 1919 - including several members of the Secret Service.


  The Secret Service doesn't protect presidents alone, calling upon other federal, state and local agencies to assist on a daily basis. When the president travels, an advance team of Secret Service agents works with the host city, state and local law enforcement, as well as public safety officials to put the the necessary security measures in place.


  When Bush Sr. would plunge into a friendly crowd, Magaw said he often had a hand on the president's belt, so that he could physically move him in the event of an emergency. He said Bush knew of the need for the hands-on protection and accommodated the service by wearing uniformly tailored suits with a single belt loop on the back of his pants so that Magaw had a relatively clear spot to grasp without becoming entangled.


  There was also the time when the agency was moved to act when Bush's penchant for speed boating on the waters near his family retreat in Maine raised concerns. Magaw said he talked to Bush about installing a safety bar near the captain's chair, where the president and secret service agent would attach themselves to guard against an unexpected fall overboard.


  "The relationship and rapport is very important," Magaw said. "That's why you spend time with them and talk through exactly how you are going to proceed."

I hate to admit it, but I finally gave up.
   
 In my early months of retirement I spent some of my idle hours cleaning out my home-office closet. I found shelves loaded with puzzles. At least a dozen jigsaw puzzles my kids (and my grownup grandkids) had gifted to me on Christ¬mases past. Most of them had a note on the box telling us who gave it to me and in what year.
   
 Why not? I said to myself. Here I was for the first time in my life with unobligated hours to kill. So, when the closet cleaning was done, I picked out one of those long-ignored puzzles and poured out the pieces on our indoor patio table which somehow has become "the" place for us to build puzzles in our house.
   
 For several weeks I spent a lot of my retirement hours rebuilding jigsaw puzzles that had been lost on that closet shelf for a decade or two. Some were easy. Others were larger and harder to master. But, with some occasional help from my daughter or from her girls, I brought back to life those long- forgotten scenes--everything from Thomas Kinkade masterpieces to Europe photos a family member sent to a puzzle maker. All of them were fun.
   
 Except for the last one. I put off to the very end a huge 2,000-piece Big Ben puzzle. As I pieced together the border (always where I start), it soon became apparent that our puzzle table was not big enough. So I devised clever extensions to hold up the corners that hung off the round tabletop.
   
 Day and night I labored over that gargantuan puzzle. It was slow going, but I made fairly good progress on the parts that had clear graphic content. But there were hundreds of almost black pieces depicting forest shadows and even more pieces covered with the look-alike branch¬es of two large pine trees that dominated the picture.
   
 To make matters worse, dozens of those same-color pieces also were so nearly the same shape that I kept putting in pieces where they didn't belong and then having to go back and undo hours of past labor. Finally, I conceded that this jigsaw puzzle was an undoable task. I hated to, but I gave up.
   
 For many of us, nothing is harder than quitting. We've been taught to stick with it, to hang tough and get the job done. Then we find ourselves confronted with a mess nobody can fix, but we keep trying. Even when it damages us.
   
 We need to be wise enough to put the impossible into the Lord's hands. In times like that, quitting is not failure. It is an act of faith.

That paired with the increased risk of infection found in cramped trains and buses, makes motorcycles a necessity in order to go about day to day life.

Asked to reflect on his legacy, Everett, who is gay, said he was born “illegal” because homosexuality was not legalised in the UK until 1967.


  “My age group, we’ve been through such a weird spectrum, as a gay person you know I was born illegal if I was gay in 1967,” he said.


  “That whole movement of the 1970s in London and in New York was so incredible and the 1980s was so weird with Mrs Thatcher and Ronald Reagan and Aids.


  “Blair’s Britain, which now seems like Camelot, to me really and it did at the time actually.


  “London was like from 1993, 1995 to 2004 was really quite … the change that came about was really amazing.


  “Then coming to this, the kind of retraction back to Camp Coffee and endless paperwork and everything going wrong and kind of back to being a soon-to-be- bankrupt Banana Republic.


  “It’s just an extraordinary journey and to survive it or to ever have any type of legacy, I think, will be miraculous actually because no-one can remember anything.


  “I don’t know about legacy; I think when you croak now things are moving too fast. No-one knows how to celebrate anything that isn’t happening right now.”


  The right type of gay at the wrong time


  Everett said that after initial early acting success with Another Country, his career stalled and he found the showbusiness world very tough, including being blanked by Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein.


  “I knew I was dead then,” he said.


  He also said he found it difficult to get a break when he switched to directing.


  “I wasn’t the right type of gay, the wrong type of gay at the wrong time, as usual, typical me,” he said.


  “The right type of gay at the wrong time. Now I don’t think I’m the right type of gay. I thought finally being gay is the card you can wave but I’m not sure if I’m the right type of queen now.”


  Asked by interviewer Emma Freud why, Everett replied: “Well, I’m not sure. I don’t know why, really.”

Patricia Beckford Acheson can empathize with the Secret Service detail protecting President Donald Trump.
 Acheson was among the first women assigned to the agency's permanent protection detail, spending more than three years protecting then-vice president George Bush Sr. in the early 1980s.
 "Our biggest fear was the lone assassin, but things have changed so much," the retired agent told USA TODAY. "Now they are dealing with organized terrorism and with COVID. The threats against a president nowadays are mind-boggling."
 Agents make safety recommendations that generally are accepted. If not, such as in the case of presidents exiting limousines to greet crowds, some kind of mutual accommodations usually are made. But the bottom line is that the president makes the call.
 "Ultimately, our job is not to say 'no,' it is to protect," Acheson said.
 Former Secret Service directors W. Ralph Basham and Lew Merletti say the White House medical office is responsible for providing advice and recommendations on the potential threat posed by disease and other health issues, which are then factored into the overall security plan. But Basham said the security and health challenge posed by the coronavirus is unprecedented.
 "We are in uncharted waters," said Basham, who served as director from 2003 to 2006. "We haven't seen anything like this before."
 And forget those made-for-TV moments where agents hustle a balking president into a bunker. They may push the president out of immediate harm's way, but longer-term decisions are subject to presidential approval. How well they are received often depends on the relationship between the president and his protective detail, former Secret Service director John Magaw says.
 "You have to be careful because you don't want to cry wolf, but you also want to be clear about any concerns you may have," Magaw said.
 Trump invited dozens of politicians and high-profile dignitaries to the White House Rose Garden on Sept. 26 to introduce Amy Coney Barrett as his pick to succeed the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the nation's high court. Many at the gathering did not wear masks, and social distancing was not apparent. Audience members sat in chairs packed next to each other, and some of those gathered exchanged hugs. Now, the president and at least seven others have tested positive for COVID-19.
 The Secret Service declined to comment.
 "I feel so badly because agents have a job and they are sworn to do it and they will do it," Acheson said. "But how do you protect someone from COVID?"
    Not just Trump: US records the most daily infections in nearly 2 months  
 Trump took a three-month hiatus from large public rallies starting in March. That ended with a rally in Tulsa on June 20. But the event drew a far-from- capacity crowd to the 19,000-seat BOK Center, and The New York Times, citing unnamed sources, said two Secret Service agents tested positive in Tulsa. Other campaign events featuring little or no social distancing have followed.
 "If he wants to do something, then we will do everything in our power to make sure that it can be done safely and securely," Magaw said. "The bottom line, it's his call."
 Ogbonnaya Omenka, an assistant professor who specializes in public health at Butler University's college of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, told USA TODAY that in an "ideal world" such gatherings would not take place in the current virus climate.
 "For any public gathering, maintaining the public health guidelines should be a top priority," he said. "However, no matter how sound the public health recommendations are, the key consideration lies in whether organizers ... adhere to them or not."
 While largely a responsibility for medical authorities, Basham said the virus could raise sensitive security questions for the Secret Service. Basham said that if the agency suspected, for example, that the president was ill with COVID-19 during a debate or other joint appearance with his Democratic rival, he said the service would likely have the obligation to take their concerns to the White House medical office so that Joe Biden - another service protectee - could be alerted to the potential risk.
 "These are very difficult situations to be in," Basham said.
 The Secret Service was originally founded to combat widespread counterfeiting of U.S. currency after the Civil War. In 1901, the agency was asked to begin its protective mission after the assassination of President William McKinley.
 Less than two decades later, the "Spanish flu" emerged in 1918. Much like Trump, then-president Woodrow Wilson downplayed it. And like Trump, Wilson became infected, contracting the illness shortly after arriving in Paris in April 1919. Sarah Fling, a fellow writing for the White House Historical Association, notes that a number of members of the Wilson entourage became ill during a transatlantic voyage in February 1919 - including several members of the Secret Service.
 The Secret Service doesn't protect presidents alone, calling upon other federal, state and local agencies to assist on a daily basis. When the president travels, an advance team of Secret Service agents works with the host city, state and local law enforcement, as well as public safety officials to put the the necessary security measures in place.
 When Bush Sr. would plunge into a friendly crowd, Magaw said he often had a hand on the president's belt, so that he could physically move him in the event of an emergency. He said Bush knew of the need for the hands-on protection and accommodated the service by wearing uniformly tailored suits with a single belt loop on the back of his pants so that Magaw had a relatively clear spot to grasp without becoming entangled.
 There was also the time when the agency was moved to act when Bush's penchant for speed boating on the waters near his family retreat in Maine raised concerns. Magaw said he talked to Bush about installing a safety bar near the captain's chair, where the president and secret service agent would attach themselves to guard against an unexpected fall overboard.
 "The relationship and rapport is very important," Magaw said. "That's why you spend time with them and talk through exactly how you are going to proceed."

"Execution down in the red zone, that's what it boils down to" Flores said. "When you get down there the throwing lanes are tighter, the safeties are closer.

“Both sides gave their all and they were cramping at the end. On a bad night, both teams went to the wire.
 “Each could have won at certain stages. We nearly had it at the end of 60 minutes and they came back and scored again. It could have gone either way.”
 Having had the best group-stage record, the Haven bypassed the quarter-finals to go straight to the semis but the pay-off was a longer wait. In contrast, the Barrs came in off the back of Wednesday night’s quarter-final win over Newcestown and McCarthy felt that was a factor in his side going 1-3 to 0-2 down early on.
 “Their intensity was way higher than ours and the water break couldn’t come quick enough for us,” he said.
 “The lads got a bit of a rollicking — ‘You’re in a semi-final now, wakey wakey.’ In the group stages, you won’t get that intensity.
 “There were stages where we could have been overrun but we came back and the Barrs were the same. Nobody gave a yard on each other.”
 Steven Sherlock had the Barrs goal on seven minutes, after Eoghan McGreevey had intercepted a loose Castlehaven defensive free kick, but, after the restart, the Haven improved and took advantage of a black card for St Finbarr’s wing-back Colin Hayes to reel off four points in a row.
 They were level as Michael Hurley pointed in the 23rd minute but the Barrs, back to the full complement, moved back in front as Maguire’s strong run set up Brian Hayes for his second point.
 By half-time, Jamie Walsh and Brian Hurley had the Haven in front, with Michael Hurley doubling that lead on the resumption, but a pair of Sherlock frees tied matters again before Denis O’Brien had the Barrs in front with a fine individual effort.
 It was 1-8 to 0-9 after Sherlock’s fourth but the game continued to ebb and flow and Conor Cahalane’s goal, set up by Mark Collins and Cathal Maguire, put Castlehaven back in front. That lead didn’t last long as Sherlock sent over two more, an off-the-ball hit in the wake of the latter sparking a brawl which resulted in a red card for Roland Whelton of the Haven and the Barrs’ Eoghan McGreevey.
 With time running out, Myers Murray almost got a goal to put the Barrs clear but Seymour saved and Cathal Maguire fisted over at the other end to make it 1-10 each. Brian Hurley then looked to have won it with his supreme effort but Sherlock forced extra time.
 When that failed to produce a winner, it was down to penalties and McCarthy reserved high praise for Collins, who had the decisive final contribution.
 “Who else would you want taking a winner-takes-all kick?” he asked.
 “He was outstanding tonight, himself and Maguire went toe-to-toe with each other and that’s what you want to see for Cork football, your best players going on each other and having a good humdinger.”

"
 I hate to admit it, but I finally gave up.
 In my early months of retirement I spent some of my idle hours cleaning out my home-office closet. I found shelves loaded with puzzles. At least a dozen jigsaw puzzles my kids (and my grownup grandkids) had gifted to me on Christ¬mases past. Most of them had a note on the box telling us who gave it to me and in what year.
 Why not? I said to myself. Here I was for the first time in my life with unobligated hours to kill. So, when the closet cleaning was done, I picked out one of those long-ignored puzzles and poured out the pieces on our indoor patio table which somehow has become \"the\" place for us to build puzzles in our house.
 For several weeks I spent a lot of my retirement hours rebuilding jigsaw puzzles that had been lost on that closet shelf for a decade or two. Some were easy. Others were larger and harder to master. But, with some occasional help from my daughter or from her girls, I brought back to life those long- forgotten scenes--everything from Thomas Kinkade masterpieces to Europe photos a family member sent to a puzzle maker. All of them were fun.
 Except for the last one. I put off to the very end a huge 2,000-piece Big Ben puzzle. As I pieced together the border (always where I start), it soon became apparent that our puzzle table was not big enough. So I devised clever extensions to hold up the corners that hung off the round tabletop.
 Day and night I labored over that gargantuan puzzle. It was slow going, but I made fairly good progress on the parts that had clear graphic content. But there were hundreds of almost black pieces depicting forest shadows and even more pieces covered with the look-alike branch¬es of two large pine trees that dominated the picture.
 To make matters worse, dozens of those same-color pieces also were so nearly the same shape that I kept putting in pieces where they didn't belong and then having to go back and undo hours of past labor. Finally, I conceded that this jigsaw puzzle was an undoable task. I hated to, but I gave up.
 For many of us, nothing is harder than quitting. We've been taught to stick with it, to hang tough and get the job done. Then we find ourselves confronted with a mess nobody can fix, but we keep trying. Even when it damages us.
 We need to be wise enough to put the impossible into the Lord's hands. In times like that, quitting is not failure. It is an act of faith.

The total number of lab-confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK has now passed 500,000, as it emerged that thousands of cases were not included in daily reports due to a technical issue with the Government’s Covid-19 dashboard.


  Public Health England (PHE) said its investigation into the technical issue identified that 15,841 cases between September 25 and October 2 were not included in the reported daily Covid-19 cases.


  The majority of these cases occurred in most recent days, PHE said.


  For example, 4,786 cases which were due to be reported on October 2 were not included in the daily total on the dashboard that day, when the figure was given as 6,968.


  The Government’s dashboard said that, as of 9am on Sunday, there had been a further 22,961 lab-confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK, bringing the total number of cases in the UK to 502,978.


  Our analysis now shows that this issue affected a total of 15,841 cases from the period between 25 September and 2 October.


  A note on the dashboard said: “The cases by publish date for 3 and 4 October include 15,841 additional cases with specimen dates between 25 September and 2 October – they are therefore artificially high for England and the UK.”

First of all, I would like to offer my prayers to President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump who have tested positive for the COVID-19 virus. I pray that they get over this virus. This just goes to show you anyone can come down with this virus. Rich or poor, and young or old. COVID-19 infections are increasing worldwide, and that is most troubling. In New York, and especially in Queens and Brooklyn, more people are testing positive. The virus is spreading to dozens of states. It seems this could be a start of a second wave and more people could be infected as winter approaches. And yet maybe some people are getting lazy and not doing the right thing. They should be social distancing, wearing face masks and washing hands frequently. Also, testing for COVID-19 is as important. Some people are not taking this pandemic seriously enough and especially the younger generation, many of whom think they can’t come down with this disease. If you look at the various protests, you will see some people wearing face masks or social distancing. Many of them don’t realize they could bring home the virus. I’m a senior citizen and worry about some of these careless people. So I say, America, get smart and do the right thing. Also, get your flu shot because the flu can kill, too. We all need to practice common sense. And thank you for all those who practice good health habits.

Journalists might seem frazzled for a different reason, however, as another unfortunate trend has developed in 2020.
 A growing problem across the nation is law enforcement officers who have acted unjustly and used excessive force against journalists. In some instances, the press has been arrested on trumped-up charges despite video evidence that clearly contradicts the “official” version of events. There was a particularly heinous example of this in Los Angeles in September.
 This week, Oregon Gov. Kate Brown has asked authorities to review recent incidents involving police at protests against racial injustice in Portland. These include an instance where videos show police grabbing a news photographer and pushing him to the ground as he was trying to document them tackling and detaining a person on a sidewalk, as reported by The Associated Press.
 An Oregon Public Broadcasting journalist also was apparently pushed by police into a tree. “I’d also love to hear elected officials explain why a reporter from my organization was subject to violence at the hands of law enforcement when judges have made it very clear this is not acceptable,” wrote OPB Editor Anna Griffin in a tweet.
 There have been numerous incidents at protests where police roughed up journalists and even cases where they targeted and shot the press with “less lethal” but still extremely damaging rounds at Black Lives Matter protests. These have happened not just in Portland, but in Salem, Eugene and elsewhere across the nation over the past few months.
 In Medford, there was another troubling case recently. On Sept. 22, police arrested 11 people, including Jefferson Public Radio reporter April Ehrlich — a former reporter at The News-Review — during a sweep of a homeless camp that formed after wildfires.

Read that again. Call your folks and tell them. Wake up the neighbors. Write it in your journal so you'll always remember the date.
 "Dear Diary, on Oct. 3rd, 2020, a Florida State quarterback actually played the position well. Isn't that amazing? Can't wait to write to you tomorrow!"
 We can scoff all we want at the competition, we can qualify everything, but the fact remains that Florida State actually got good quarterback play Saturday.
 And the result was an emphatic 41-24 victory that included five touchdown drives in a row for Travis. I don't know the last time that was done around here, but I'm going to go ahead and assume a No. 5 was at quarterback.
 "The way he was able to execute the game plan that we had showed his mental preparation," said FSU head coach Mike Norvell, who admitted that Travis didn't practice much during the week because of ongoing injury issues. "And Jordan told us in pregame that he felt like he could go out and play at a high level. And so we wanted to give him that opportunity, looking for a spark."
 It was a spark all right. And one that was desperately needed after freshman starter Tate Rodemaker threw one of the worst pick-sixes in Doak Campbell Stadium history on his first drive against Jacksonville State.
 Rodemaker's next three drives were missed field goal, punt and punt. And that, my friends, was a wrap on the Rodemaker Era (for the time being at least).
 And that was also the start of the Jordan Travis Era.
 Norvell seemed to make it obvious on Saturday that James Blackman is no longer a part of the quarterback picture at Florida State. You could argue he made that decision a couple of games too late, but in all honesty he didn't have much choice with Travis and freshman Chubba Purdy missing most of preseason camp and still dealing with lingering injuries.
 But when he elected to send Travis out there in the second quarter, instead of Blackman, it proved what we all suspected: That Blackman's days as the starting quarterback at Florida State are all but over.
 Travis went out and made the most of his opportunity.

What a great opportunity.                                                                                                         Queen Street has always been difficult to navigate especially because it is a two-way street, very narrow with parking on one side. Although the case could be made for converting Queen Street to a one-way street, I believe a better case can be made for closing it permanently and making it a pedestrian mall.                                                                                                         It could be a beautiful and bustling business mall, but instead it looks more like a make-shift garage sale. The barriers to entry look more like a police barricade than an invitation to eat and shop. I think the city and the shop owners could do much better. We could have a real showcase on Queen Street.

Dolly Parton is in talks with _Playboy_ to appear in the magazine to celebrate her 75th birthday. She last appeared on the magazine's cover back in October 1978, and could make another appearance if it was in "good taste," the legendary country music star said. Parton turns 75 in January and she just released her 47th solo album on Friday, _A Holly Dolly Christmas_.


  Parton appeared on the _Scott Mills & Chris Stark Show_ on BBC Radio 5 Live this weekend, and she was asked about working with _Playboy_. Mills asked her if appearing in the magazine was part of her 75th birthday plans. "Yeah, I just might do it, if I can do it in good taste and they want it [and] we'll do it along with a really good interview inside. So, yeah, we've talked about it," Parton said, reports _The Daily Mail_.


  In that same interview, Parton opened up about her sleeping habits. She confirmed she is a "very early riser" and wakes up at 3 a.m. every day. "I've always done that. Even if I go to bed late, I just seem to wake up at 3 a.m.," Parton said. "I do some of my best work in the morning between 3 a.m. and 7 a.m. I don't sleep my life away."


  Parton has shown no signs of slowing down, as she released her first Christmas album in 30 years on Friday. A Holly Dolly Christmas includes a collection of Christmas standards and collaborations. She recorded a take on Mariah Carey's "All I Want For Christmas Is You" with Jimmy Fallon and "Christmas Where Are You" with Billy Ray Cyrus. Miley Cyrus also appears on "Christmas Is." Willie Nelson recorded a new version of his song "Pretty Paper" with Parton, and Parton's brother Randy appears on "You Are My Christmas."


  This holiday season, Parton fans will also see the singer in _Christmas on the Square_, a new Netflix movie hitting the streaming service on Nov. 22. The film stars Christine Baranski as Regina Fuller, who returns to her hometown after her father dies to evict everyone during the holiday season. Parton stars as the angel who rekindles Regina's old romance and helps inspire her to change her mind. The film will include 14 Parton songs, including the title track. Parton previously worked with Netflix on the movie _Dumplin'_ and the anthology series _Heartstrings_ , which featured episodes inspired by Parton's songs.
