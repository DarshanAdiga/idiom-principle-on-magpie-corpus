This isn't about principle or consistency or fairness. It's about cold, hard math. Republicans hold a 12-10 majority on the Judiciary Committee, and a 53-47 margin in the Senate as a whole. Even a Covid-19 outbreak in the Senate itself couldn't delay the start of the hearings by a single day. That's how determined Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen. Lindsey Graham, and their Republican colleagues are to get Barrett confirmed.

There are other long-standing issues such as cow smuggling and consumption of beef where there is no consensus between the two communities. Things escalated to such a degree that members of Youth Congress slaughtered a calf in broad daylight in Kerala and consumed its meat. That the leader of such a party claims that India is a symbol of 'Hindu-Muslim unity' is indeed a disgrace.

And it’s for good measure, too, since Black voter participation fell in the 2016 election compared to the historic levels in which they cast ballots for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. It’s a simple math equation: If more Black people vote Democratic, chances of Joe Biden beating Donald Trump increase exponentially. With the inclusion of a growing number of Black folks, the DNC is surely counting on that to be true.

_Napoli, 13 ott 12:42 - (Agenzia Nova)_ \- "Quanto accaduto a Terzigno (Na) circa l'ennesimo tentativo di fuga di migranti in quarantena è grave e riguarda principalmente la sicurezza di ognuno di noi". Lo ha dichiarato il senatore della Lega Francesco Urraro. "Nella vigenza di uno dei momenti più difficili con la pandemia e con cittadini impegnati responsabilmente a seguire regole ferree, è inconcepibile una violazione del genere nella superiore tutela della salute pubblica. I cittadini italiani devono continuare a rispettare le regole che ci siamo dati e vale lo stesso per i turisti o per chi ha diritto alla protezione internazionale. Lo Stato, dal canto suo, ha il dovere di occuparsi di questo genere di problema aumentando vigilanza e sorveglianza. Circostanze che provvederò a segnalare ulteriormente al Ministro dell'Interno".

It has a small turning circle, I can whip it into any car bay anywhere in the city. It does $30 of fuel every two weeks. At the end of the day, I am just a person and I enjoy doing exactly what everybody else does. I go down to the cafe, have a good read of the newspapers, catch up on what's happening, I might have two poached eggs on toast, hold on the bacon."

I’ve been talking a lot about maternal mental health in the midst of a pandemic realising pregnant women have often been left without care from our government. In this new world of living surrounded by a killer virus we’ve created measures to keep our economy floating, strategies to ensure kids are educated and facilitated people going back to work but we still haven’t allowed mothers a hand to hold through what can be one of the most frightening and worrying times in their lives.
 Welcoming a baby is very happy but it can also be fraught with anxiety even for a fourth-time mum like me. My face to face appointments have been reduced while telephone conversations with medical professionals haven’t always cut it – not that the maternity team are lacking but more their hands are tied. I’m obviously not new to this so have insisted on more care when needed but thinking back to being pregnant for the first time I’m not sure I’d have felt able to.
 I have, in the past, been given news at a scan I wasn’t expecting and though partners are now allowed into the sonography room they have to leave the hospital afterwards.
 The thought of being in a similar situation today with my husband then having to leave me while I wait for my bloods to be taken or to see a consultant is utterly terrifying - yet this is what has been happening to women. When it comes to labour we are asked to cope alone until in established movements and then, after the baby is born, the birthing partner is not allowed to stay. After having my third child who was born in a tremendously emergency situation, my husband was allowed to stay with me for the duration - even allowed to stay the night. He physically lifted me to the bathroom, held the baby because I could not, fed and watered me, poured my wee into a bottle to give the midwives, administered medication and looked after us when we absolutely could not look after ourselves. It was necessary for me and I have to wonder what on earth women in similar positions are doing today.

Thus, we see that the much exalted 'Hindu-Muslim unity' that charlatans such as Shashi Tharoor evaporates into thin air on every major contentious issue. 'Evaporates into thin air' is perhaps the wrong phrase to use here since such a unity never existed in the first place. And these are only three of the most contentious issues in recent times.

Stimulus checks, paused student loan payments and the need to stay at home may have helped you cut back on your debt for the first time. Keep that momentum going and take control of your finances. First, capitalize on the money-saving techniques you’ve learned this year by setting a budget. If you weren’t a saver before but started socking money away during the pandemic, build on that new habit by automating your savings. Lastly, ask for help with understanding your finances. Credit counselors offer many services for free or at low cost.

He physically lifted me to the bathroom, held the baby because I could not, fed and watered me, poured my wee into a bottle to give the midwives, administered medication and looked after us when we absolutely could not look after ourselves. It was necessary for me and I have to wonder what on earth women in similar positions are doing today. Numbers have risen for home birth choices as a result. I experienced this with my second baby but through my own volition, I can't imagine feeling forced into because it because it seems a better alternative to the choice a woman would really like to make. Birthing partners are welcome to wet their baby's head with five friends at home but not welcome to stay and look after their new family - baffling. Two people, living in one bubble surely pose no more risk than one person alone yet the aftermath of having that hand held at such a vulnerable time is invaluable to the mental health of the mother. Colief conducted a study of 1001 pregnant women during this time which shows 51% of women have felt isolated during the pandemic both before and after pregnancy. 43% say it has had a detrimental affect on their mental health. I can only imagine these numbers going up because it's not just prenatal care of women we need to be thinking about but postnatal too. Becoming a mother for the first time for me I was 100 miles away from family and the only friends I had were work mates. I didn't know the area where I lived other than to come home to and suddenly being with my baby 24\/7 felt lonely and scary in a way I'd never imagined. My midwife told me to go and visit my local SureStart centre (most of these have been cut now) and meet some other mums in similar situations which is what I did and 11 years later I still have this tribe of women holding my back. We swapped advice, told each other our worries, pounded the pavements together and over the years we've drunk a lot of wine together too. It was one of these mums who helped me on a morning when I'd had no sleep and was worried senseless about my happy in the day time baby but who would curl up into an angry, red ball come 11pm screaming in what turned out to be colic. She knew, she told me to visit my Dr and he recommended I give my baby Colief Infant Drops which literally changed our lives. I also picked up other tips like rubbing breast milk into rashes and that baby vests have envelope opening shoulders so that you can roll them down rather than over the head (a revelation for a poonami) and so many more things. They are my true friends and I'd be as lost without them today as I would have been then - poor first time mums today not getting that opportunity to meet their support system. No wonder so many are suffering with their mental health as a result of being isolated. Having a baby is a shock to the system and can be a terribly lonely place when it's just you and the baby for the first time. We do need to think about new mums as vulnerable members of society and give them help, assistance and methods of working through this pandemic in as normal a way as possible or we shall end up with a pandemic of postnatal depression as well.Ruth Davies is a parenting blogger.

The first day of confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett featured plenty of fiery moments, but a lot of them revolved around the upcoming election instead of Barrett herself. For instance, all eyes were on VP nominee Kamala Harris, a former prosecutor, when she delivered an opening statement criticizing President Trump and Republicans for attacking the Affordable Care Act. Both sides have all but agreed Barrett's confirmation by the Republican-led Senate is a done deal, so Democrats instead used some of their questioning time to make a pitch to save the Affordable Care Act. Republicans, meanwhile, criticized Democrats for bringing up Barrett's Catholic faith and her association with the Christian group People of Praise, saying it amounted to, as Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley said, "religious bigotry." Progressives are worried that with another religion-led conservative on the bench, abortion rights cases could be dismantled.
