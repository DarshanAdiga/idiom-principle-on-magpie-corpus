"It's one of those things that I never imagined doing," Svoboda said. "It was certainly a different experience when I first got to the Blue Jackets because I had never done anything like that before. That was almost the most concerning part about taking the job. I don't want to go on there and embarrass myself not knowing the protocol. That's where Tanner Smith (their former video guy) was so good. He showed me the ropes. He showed me how to handle things. It turns out it's not difficult at all. When it comes to the road, the thing that's fun is that the people you travel with kind of become your family for the month. It's weird when the season ends. The people you were with for the last seven months are suddenly no longer there. It's a little bit of a jarring thing. With there being turnover in sports, you knew that group wasn't going to get back together again. The first year, I sat next to Tanner on the plane. Then he leaves and there's a new video guy so it's a new person I sit next to. It's not like we're going to dinner with the players or coaches or anything like that. For those of us that do get to travel though, the perks are certainly unbelievable. The travel itself is about as comfortable as can be. The hotels are great. There are no complaints about the food. They take care of us well."

Several hundred easements in Colorado were abandoned over the last 15 years when the land trusts that held them dissolved. Until the coronavirus forced lawmakers home, the legislature was working on a measure that would allow the state to find the orphaned agreements a new home and provide compensation to easement holders swept up in past abuse.
 Keven Turecek and his wife, Sandi, moved forward in 2011 with little hesitation. "We've watched a lot of good farm ground and good ranch ground go under development," she recalled recently from a muddy pickup, as the couple and their dog, a blue heeler named K.D., made daily rounds to check on cattle.
 The Tureceks combined land their families have worked near Deer Trail for more than a century with other parcels and formed the 35,000-acre Stacked Lazy 3 Ranch, which they plan on turning over to one of their sons. About 5,400 acres is covered by the easement they forged with Colorado Cattlemen's Agricultural Land Trust and Great Outdoors Colorado, and the $1 million they earned from giving up development rights there will benefit their other three children.
 Grassland birds, among the world's most rapidly declining avian species, abound here, as do mountain lions, deer and pronghorn antelope. The Tureceks take pride in the health of their ranch, and they've won accolades for their efforts to convert poorly managed areas back to native grass, build miles of terraces so the soil will better hold water, restore riparian areas and plant trees to prevent erosion. Their Angus cattle are rotated among pastures so the land can recover.
 "Conservation easements are preserving not only a way of life on working farms and ranches — that is only 2 percent of the population," Sandi Turecek noted. "But they feed the other 98 percent, and it's in everyone's best interest to keep farmers and ranchers on their farms and ranches."

Somehow I ended up talking to Kenny McCudden right by the elevators (at the hotel.) I mentioned to Kenny that Maetz is going to Lake Louise tomorrow but I can't go. He just look at me and goes 'Jeff! Have you every been to the Canadian Rockies?' I said Kenny, I have not. He then goes, 'Jeff, you gotta go. You'll never forget it. You have to go.' So we jumped in a minivan and went.

The lifting of the lockdown, whenever it is done, has to be done in a staggered fashion. Because all of our hard work for the last two-three weeks will then go to waste if there is a full back-to-normal sort of movement like earlier. So, lifting also, whether you call it staggered or partial or stage wise…that is the only way to go forward. It's not a choice of either or because we have to breathe life back into the economy because 83 percent of all people employed in this country are in the unorganised sector, and they live hand to mouth. So, for them to sustain such a long lockdown is really a life-threatening challenge.

I had never thought that there would be days when I would be a watchman with unending shifts. Staying with my 84-year-old grandmother, who lives alone at Butala village, not a long way from Amritsar, eventually made me one.
 I picked this role out of necessity and not of choice. I landed to meet her just a day prior to the national lockdown and could not return. For the first three days, it was hard to digest seeing the usual visitors coming to meet her, despite several worrying news reports on COVID-19 and the village gurdwara’s announcements urging people to stay at home to contain the spread of the virus.
 In shock, I couldn’t hold asking each of the visitors, mostly elderly women, why they were not taking precautions. In return, I got evasive answers, and my grandmother stood with them. Of course, this was not the right means in current times.
 The maids too continued coming, though I told them how unsafe it was for us and them.
 So, how could I have let this go on? Which is why, I pressed myself into action and took the gate in my hand ensuring no one enters. Thankfully, I got hold of the lock. And round the clock, I keep it locked.
 Still some visitors continue to flow, but I stand at a distance and stop them, alerting them to possible threat of infection. Or I give false excuses such as my grandmother is sleeping when she is wide awake. But some women are clever too and try to gain entry by saying that they have come for the leftover butter milk or for returning utensils. But I don’t forget to show them the red flag which by now may have already made me unpopular. But why should I mind as long as I am able to ensure the needed precautions?
 Sure, my grandmother too must be a bit unhappy. I may have taken up all chores of the maid, besides helping her in the kitchen. Still she may be yearning for me to leave, as I didn’t let her visit the neighbour next door.
 In between, when I pepper her with several dos and dont’s, I can sense an irritation on her face but I instantly change the topic, mostly asking about her childhood memories, especially when she was the head girl in the village school.
 One day, while we were having an intriguing chat, I sensed someone at the gate and I rushed out, but it was someone at the neighbour’s door and I returned proud at being such a faithful watchman.
 Certainly, across the country, many must have become a watchman like me to guard themselves and their loved ones. They may be irksome, but if they are, its for safeguarding everyone around. And to all those, who are still not taking the precautions seriously, let us not forget that prevention is better than cure. By the way, this virus does not even have any cure. So, why throw precautions to the wind?

Such agreements currently protect about 5 million acres in Wyoming, Montana and Colorado. In 2017, researchers at Colorado State University found up to a $12 return for every $1 spent via state tax credits and a unique program that taps lottery proceeds.
 Yet as easements proliferate across contiguous properties, concerns mount about whether taxpayer money should be expended on private land that may remain accessible only to the landowner. While advocates say the public benefits because deed restrictions preserve prime agricultural land that serves a greater good, hunters are particularly worried that prohibitions could affect the longevity of their pastime — and the permit fees they pay that help support state parks.
 "Access is commonly cited as one of the top reasons people stop hunting — it's harder and harder for them to find," said Joel Webster, senior director of western programs at the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership in Missoula, Mont.
 Conservation easements have been around for decades, encouraged by federal and state tax benefits. (California and New York were the first states to pass legislation.) Interest jumped sharply as development claimed at least 31 million acres of prime agricultural land between 1992 and 2012, according to a 2018 report from the American Farmland Trust. Nationwide, an estimated 40 million acres of natural habitat now fall under easements. A quarter of that is along the Eastern Seaboard.
 Funding remains a major hurdle, however. After land trusts lobbied for additional support, Congress almost doubled money available to protect agricultural land in the 2018 farm bill to $450 million a year. Even so, the U.S. Department of Agriculture can fund only 30% of the applications it receives annually for its easements program, said program manager Jerome Faulkner.
 The impact of easements in agricultural-rich regions extends well beyond individual landowners. If farm and ranch operations cease, small towns struggle to support stores that sell machinery, groceries and gas. Just as important, advocates say, is how easements help sustain a generations-old heritage under siege from rampant development.

Liam Foudy looks like he can be an NHL player next year. The guys at the World Juniors (Kirill) Marchenko and (Dmitri) Voronkov were excellent as well. Voronkov impressed scouts more than anyone on that Russian team. Eric Hjorth and Tyler Angle are guys being developed but have shown some good skills. The goaltender pipeline is really good.

It's rather immature and high-schoolish to boot. Certainly this message is not going to be appealing to a surburban female professional swing voter whose IRA just got decimated. I suspect some of the constituents that voted for her wouldn't like it either, such as the prosperity gospel fans of Caribbean heritage or Afro-American urban professional women, etc.

Not a sound from anywhere. Just eerily quiet. Visakhapatnam, known as the “Steel City”, has transformed into a “still city”. Determined to stay away from electronic, print and social media, I then went over to our rooftop garden and walked amid the flowers and fruits my wife has been growing. Didn’t realise she had grown such a variety. I discovered the soothing fragrances of the flowers and their pleasing colours. I sat in the shade with a gentle cool morning breeze. No sounds from anywhere except from the wind chimes swaying in the garden. I should spend more time in the garden, I thought.
 The natural surroundings are soothing, but the silence is “deafening”. I kept thinking how much we have got used to the noise and chaos we create and how far we have got from peace and tranquillity that once surrounded us, and how this new experience of lockdown of just a few days is choking us.
 But I am glad that this has been thrust upon us; else we would never have been able to experience this.
 And I hope this experience will be frozen in our minds and that every once in a while, we will long for and practice this “emptiness” to cleanse our cluttered lifestyles, minds and souls.

As the virus spreads exponentially, these measures are also necessary to avoid completely paralysing countries' health systems. Lothar Wieler, president of Germany's Robert Koch Institute, a federal agency for disease control and prevention, urges that the precautionary measures be observed without fail. Otherwise, we can expect 10 million more infections in Germany alone in two to three months.

Hefty fine and other penal actions are on the cards against owners of vehicles that were temporarily impounded for violation of lockdown norms in Kozhikode district.
 For now, it has been decided to collect a compounding fee of ₹10,000, apart from initiating other legal actions against each owner before releasing the vehicle from Monday.
 According to officials, there are 2,817 vehicles in police custody now, and a majority of them are motorbikes. To free up space near the police station, there is a plan to shift the newly seized vehicles to the Armed Reserve Camp at Maloorkunnu.
 More than 50% of the vehicles were seized in the initial days of the lockdown. Action was also taken against those who failed to produce self-declaration forms.
 Though the impounded vehicles will be released on payment of compounding fee, violators who have been booked under the Epidemic Diseases Act will have to face court proceedings.
 Meanwhile, officials attached to the Police Media Centre said there was no let-up in violations, going by the daily figures. According to them, over 6,000 cases were registered in the State in the last three days for violation of the Epidemic Diseases Act. More than 4,500 vehicles were also seized, they said.
 There were also instances where emergency vehicles like ambulances were misused for suspicious trips. One such ambulance, which was allegedly used for service of no emergency nature, was impounded from the city on Friday. In the light of the incident, highway patrol squads are checking all ambulances.
 The use of drones has been recommended in areas where lockdown violations are rampant. The city and rural police have already secured high-resolution drone cameras for enforcement. They will be frequently used in places where the District Collector recently imposed stringent regulations.

On a personal note this hymn has always moved me as no other does. I had it played at my son's funeral and when I depart this Vale of Tears I have requested that it be played at mine. It reminds me that God died for me, something I find absolutely stunning. Love and sacrifice begin and end with God, who regards each man as if there were no other.
