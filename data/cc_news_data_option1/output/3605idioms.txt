The soft-spoken but determined Bizos represented Mandela from his treason trial in 1964 until the former South African president's death in 2013. Bizos is credited with getting Mandela to add the words “if needs be” to his speech from the dock in which he said he was prepared to die for his ideals. The addition was seen as an escape clause, avoiding any impression that Mandela was goading the court to impose the death penalty.

NEW YORK (AP) — Century 21 Stores — a destination for bargain hunters looking for fat deals on designer dresses and shoes, cosmetics and housewares for nearly 60 years — has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and is winding down its business, shutting all 13 stores across New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Florida.Century 21 joins more than two dozen retailers who have filed for bankruptcy since the pandemic, which forced non-essential stores to temporarily close. In a statement, the New York-based company said that the decision followed nonpayment by the company’s insurance providers of approximately $175 million due under policies put in place to protect against losses stemming from business interruption. That insurance money helped it rebuild its flagship store, a magnet for locals and tourists in downtown Manhattan after it was damaged by the 9/11 attacks, the company said.“We now have no viable alternative but to begin the closure of our beloved family business because our insurers, to whom we have paid significant premiums every year for protection against unforeseen circumstances like we are experiencing today, have turned their backs on us at this most critical time,” said Century 21 co-CEO Raymond Gindi in statement. Gindi said that if Century 21 had received “any meaningful portion” of the insurance proceeds, it would have been able “to save thousands of jobs and weather the storm in hopes of another incredible recovery.”The company said that it’s removing from the bankruptcy court a lawsuit pending in the Supreme Court of the State of New York against several of its insurance providers based on their failure to compensate the company for its losses under the policies. The company is requesting that the bankruptcy court expedite the adjudication of the suit for the benefit of its stakeholders.Century 21 says it’s starting going-out-of business sales at all of its stores and online.

STRENGTHS & LIMITATIONS: The main strength was the large sample of young adolescents across 53 countries. However, findings from the present study should be interpreted in light of its limitations. First, the study was cross- sectional in nature and thus the direction of the association cannot be established. Second, the data only included young adolescents who attend school. Third, data were self-reported and thus reporting bias may exist. Fourth, the measure of sexual activity used was not able to distinguish between penetrative and nonpenetrative sex. Fifth, adolescents who are victims of bullying may also be exposed to other types of violence such as child maltreatment and sexual assaults, for which data were not available. Finally, the present data set did not contain data on sexual orientation.
