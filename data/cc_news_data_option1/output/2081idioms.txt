Stitch Fix Inc. (SFIX) shares on Wednesday's trading session, dropped -3.67 percent to see the stock exchange hands at $23.61 per unit. Lets a quick look at company’s past reported and future predictions of growth using the EPS Growth. EPS growth is a percentage change in standardized earnings per share over the trailing-twelve-month period to the current year-end. The company posted a value of $0.25 as earning-per-share over the last full year, while a chance, will post -$0.09 for the coming year. The current EPS Growth rate for the company during the year is -25.50% and predicted to reach at 61.90% for the coming year. In-depth, if we analyze for the long-term EPS Growth, the scenario is totally different as the current prediction is 27.50% for the next five year.

For Miron, getting Americans back to work means getting the economy back up and running as quickly and safely as possible.
 "This requires reduced impediments to economic activity and reduced disincentives to employment," he writes.
 By scaling back lockdowns and permitting individuals and businesses to adapt and operate in a post-pandemic world, policymakers can facilitate the economic activity and innovation necessary to develop a resilient, long-term economic norm, he writes.
 A crucial part of his plan involves making sure that laid-off workers are not incentivized to stay out of the workforce.
 "Current proposals provide unemployment insurance benefits under which many lower-income workers are better off staying at home than re-entering the labor force. Even when governments lift lockdowns, businesses will be crippled without an adequate supply of labor," he writes.
 "Now, more than ever, businesses must have the freedom to develop novel workarounds to never before seen challenges," he adds.

Sun Gazette editorial: Get informed on special election
 [Sun Gazette editorials represent the viewpoint of Sun Gazette Newspapers, which provides content to, but is otherwise unaffiliated with, InsideNoVa or Rappahannock Media LLC.]
 After a lot of gamesmanship and foolishness over the past couple of weeks, things have settled down and we now have the field set for the upcoming special election to fill the seat of late County Board member Erik Gutshall.
 As we noted in this space while events transpired, the remaining County Board members covered themselves in mud, not glory, in attempting to convince the Virginia Supreme Court to delay the election to September or even November.
 The court’s resulting slapdown of the board’s quixotic request was quick and definitive, proving the County Board’s effort to be a monumental waste of time.
 It will be a contested election, and the low turnout will ensure that every vote truly does count. Arlington residents need to get themselves informed as best they can in the current circumstances, in order to cast informed ballots when the time comes.
 The Arlington Chamber of Commerce, Arlington Committee of 100 and presumably other organizations will be hosting debates – in a “virtual” format – and other advocacy groups will be circulating questionnaires for the candidates to fill out. There will be plenty of information out there, even if the electorate may have to do a little digging to unearth it.
 Democrats have the edge, as they always do in Arlington races, but summertime special elections can be wild cards (one reason the Democratic leadership and Democrats on the County Board tried so hard to avoid a summer race). Every vote indeed is going to count, so get up to speed and be prepared to make an informed decision.

RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — When registered nurse Amanda Marsh lost her job working from her Virginia home as a health plan medical reviewer late last year, unemployment benefits helped support her family while she looked for work.Those ran out in March, so when she found out the coronavirus relief bill that Congress passed around the same time contained a provision providing up to 13 extra weeks of benefits to people like her, she was relieved.But Marsh is still waiting, along with tens of thousands of Virginians who the state says are eligible for the Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation program. The Virginia Employment Commission hasn’t gotten the program off the ground yet — and doesn’t expect to until July.“It blows my mind that they think people can live that long with no income,” said Marsh, who described making ends meet thanks to money from selling her previous home. The Pittsylvania County resident with two young children said she’s had a hard time finding a new job at a time when health care companies have been furloughing workers.As of early this week, Virginia was one of 19 states that have yet to start making payments under the PEUC program, according to the U.S. Labor Department.And Virginia appears to be among a handful of states moving particularly slowly to implement the benefits, according to an Associated Press review of public statements by state employment agencies. Of the states not yet making payments, many have said they expect to start taking applications by the end of May.“The program exists on paper, but the bills are real and the money’s not there. And, you know, that’s a huge problem for folks,” said Pat Levy-Lavelle, an attorney with the the Legal Aid Justice Center in Richmond.Across the U.S., roughly 41 million people have sought jobless aid since the coronavirus first prompted businesses to close down and shrink their workforces, the government said Thursday. All told, the figures point to a job market gripped by its worst crisis in decades.In Virginia, the unemployment rate has reached 10.6%. Nearly 59,000 Virginians filed initial unemployment claims last week, according to federal data, marking a reversal in a six-week run of falling totals.Virginia’s employment commissioner, Ellen Marie Hess, told lawmakers during a Senate committee meeting last week that the agency expects to begin making payments under the federally funded PEUC program in July but did not elaborate.The program is separate from the $600 weekly federal payments that can go to anyone in the country who has lost a job. The extra 13 weeks under the PEUC program would kick in only after recipients exhaust their unemployment compensation, so many of those who qualify at this point lost their jobs long before the coronavirus took hold in the U.S. and presumably could be in greater need of help.The commission estimates about 25,000-30,000 people are eligible, spokeswoman Joyce Fogg said. Fogg said the agency’s IT department is working on reprogramming a system first implemented in 1985 to accept applications, and the agency hopes to have it ready no later than July 2. She later wrote in an email that the commission doesn’t have an exact date, and she did not explain the change.Fogg said the commission — which, like other employment agencies around the county, has been dealing with a staggering number of unemployment claims — has had to work through implementing the coronavirus relief bill in phases.“Text messages will be sent when the application is available,” she wrote in an email.Marsh and others say they have encountered trouble reaching anyone over the phone — a long-running complaint — getting accurate information or even a start date for the program. On Thursday, the website said additional information “concerning the process to claim the PEUC benefits will be forthcoming soon.”George Inge, who was laid off in May 2019 from a small medical device sales company, said he has been given conflicting information from various employment commission workers about which type of benefit he might qualify for. Inge said the most recent information he has received was that he is eligible for PEUC, although the employee he spoke with said she didn’t know much about the program or when it would be running.“I really don’t know what they are doing other than they are pitifully slow and I pray everyone will hear this week and get money this week,” one employment commission employee wrote to Inge in an email he provided to AP. “And you are right it is a waiting game.”Inge, a father of three, including one in college, said his family is barely getting by and might consider listing their Crozet home soon if nothing changes.Hina Latif, a 32-year-old who was laid off last year from aerospace and defense company General Dynamics, exhausted her unemployment benefits and has also been waiting for information about PEUC. Latif said her family is doing OK because they’ve cut back their spending and her husband, an attorney, is still employed. But she said others in a less fortunate situation could quickly be pushed into poverty.“I think it’s the duty of our institutions, specifically the VEC, to work effectively in a situation like this,” she said. “And the fact that we were not ready ... it unveils the impairments of our society.”Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

  The Professional Game Group will now draw up plans for the restart of domestic cricket, with their proposals going to the ECB board in June.


  Among the ideas the ECB said Thursday were being considered are regionalised groups in for the 18 first-class counties as well as allowing in small numbers of spectators to grounds in order to maintain social distancing - although it is expected internationals in England this season will be played behind closed doors.

Before sentencing Christensen on a pair of misdemeanor charges, the judge expressed serious doubts about Christensen’s claim.


  “We’ve had a number of cases rising out of the Forrest Fenn treasure — people who have said they know exactly where it is,” said Carman, who presides at the federal courthouse in Mammoth Hot Springs, “but they’ve all been looking in different locations.”


  Fenn published a riddle in 2010 that, he says, lays out the location of gold and jewels he stashed somewhere in the Rocky Mountain region. The New Mexico art dealer has said that you don’t need to “climb up or down a steep precipice” to retrieve the treasure and that he hid it while in his late 70s.


  “... it would have been extremely difficult if not impossible for him [Fenn] to hide the treasure in this location considering his age and health,” Carman offered to Christensen at the hearing. “But that’s really of no concern to me.”


  The judge said his major concern was that Christensen’s decision to rappel 800 feet down into the canyon put both himself and the responding rangers in a very dangerous situation.


  “You really apparently were not equipped to make this trip, either in equipment or in experience, and it was ... [what] I would consider highly reckless behavior on your part,” Carman said.


  After coming up with his “solve” to Fenn’s riddle, Christensen scouted out the canyon on a snowmobile trip in late December, then returned with supplies on Jan. 6.


  However, federal officials say he had little climbing experience. He tied his rope to a railing at a Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone overlook — doing so in an unsafe manner, according to federal prosecutors — and ran out of rope before reaching the bottom of the canyon.


  Christensen then had to “scoot” down to the river and was unable to get back to his rope, requiring a rescue by 11 National Park Service personnel, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Devon Beeny. She said the operation was “incredibly dangerous.”


  One ranger had to descend into the canyon to retrieve Christensen. On their way up, Christensen said multiple times that “he didn’t think he could go on and requested a helicopter” to evacuate him, Beeny said. However, no helicopter was available amid the snowy winter conditions.


  “If he [Christensen] had thought this through, behaved less recklessly, he may have known all of this, but instead he placed his own life and the lives of his rescuers in danger with his descent,” Beeny said.


  In an interview this month, Christensen said his request for a helicopter was taken out of context.


  “We started climbing up the hill and I said, ‘Jesus, this is arduous.’ Even the guy that came down for me said it was kind of cumbersome,” he said. “Then I said it would have been a better thing to send a [expletive] helicopter. And that’s all I said in passing, and now all of a sudden they throw that in there — that I needed a helicopter. That’s one of the things I couldn’t defend myself about.”


  As part of a plea deal, Christensen pleaded guilty to misdemeanor counts of creating a hazardous condition and offtrail travel in the canyon, while prosecutors dropped another misdemeanor count of violating the conditions of his snowmobiling permit.


  The U.S. Attorney’s Office argued for a sentence of seven to 10 days in jail while Christensen asked for no jail time.


  In her remarks, Beeny noted that Christensen first told the rangers that “he just did this for fun and didn’t have an intended reason and wasn’t looking for anything in the bottom of the canyon.”


  Christensen explained that he initially hid his treasure seeking because “you had 11 rangers ... and I didn’t want to entice one of them to actually go down and look for that thing.”


  Christsensen has consistently said he isn’t interested in the riches, but rather to be proven right and to stop folks from dying in search of the treasure.

SANTA CLARITA, Calif. (AP) — A Los Angeles County Fire Department helicopter made a safe emergency landing after one of its two engines failed Thursday morning, the department said. The Sikorsky Firehawk was returning from a forward deployed location to its base to swap out its four-member crew when the No. 2 engine failed and the pilot set it down in the Canyon Country area of Santa Clarita. The aircraft will undergo testing by mechanics before it flies again, the department said. Another helicopter from the county’s fleet of Firehawks and Bell 412s will be used in the meantime. The county staffs three helicopters around the clock at strategic locations to handle a range of missions. The helicopters return to Pacoima each morning to change crews and then head back out.

Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) shares on Wednesday's trading session, jumped 0.23 percent to see the stock exchange hands at $144.89 per unit. Lets a quick look at company’s past reported and future predictions of growth using the EPS Growth. EPS growth is a percentage change in standardized earnings per share over the trailing-twelve-month period to the current year-end. The company posted a value of $6.41 as earning-per-share over the last full year, while a chance, will post $9.06 for the coming year. The current EPS Growth rate for the company during the year is 0.50% and predicted to reach at 17.23% for the coming year. In-depth, if we analyze for the long-term EPS Growth, the out- come was -0.20% for the past five years and the scenario is totally different as the current prediction is 4.80% for the next five year.

Nancy Reardon, who chairs Signet's compensation committee, said the changes were meant to retain management talent and give executives "fair and realistic" goals in light of the pandemic. Company spokeswoman Colleen Rooney said the company had business reasons beyond the pandemic for changing executive compensation and that the adjustments could translate to lower pay if the company performs well. Red Robin said on April 14 that it would eliminate 50 restaurant support positions and cut pay by 20% for support and supervision workers in response to the pandemic, matching an earlier 20% cut to executive base salaries. It also closed 35 of the 454 restaurants it operates and furloughed or re-assigned an undisclosed number of workers.

Wyoming is at a point where it needs more investment into its ageing infrastructure and the pandemic is the perfect excuse to do so, as long as the state’s legislature finally decides to open up spending some of its reserves.


  The pandemic has resulted a large number of people being laid off from their jobs. The oil and gas industry has been particularly impacted, though travel and tourism efforts across the state will likely see diminished returns as well. Less revenue means less work.


  However, if the state poured heavy investments into its highway system, as well as local governments seeking to accomplish projects that have slowly accumulated due to the cost of construction versus the revenue they’ve received over the past few years, Wyoming could create jobs for many of those unemployed. It would also set itself up for a resurgence after the pandemic finally subsides.


  We’re not just focused on the physical infrastructure such as roads, water and the like — we also believe more investment should occur in providing high- speed fiber connections throughout the state. When compared to Utah and Colorado, Wyoming’s internet speeds are woefully behind the curve and those speeds and connectivity are quickly becoming a selling point for companies looking to expand their operations. Wyoming cannot compete with neighboring states, even if it sacrifices tax revenue through tax credits to attract business. Wyoming struggles to even keep its most educated residents in the state as graduates from the University of Wyoming and the state’s community colleges tend to leave for better opportunities elsewhere.

Shaun Antler wants to wrap up her unique music tour while she can still spend plenty of time at home.


  The stage director of Rotaryfest’s Stage 1 is compiling a list of as many Sault Ste. Marie bands, and their members, as she can.


  Her tally started two years ago when the summer festival saluted the city’s musical history. The venture went on hold before Antler resumed work during the COVID-19 pandemic. Her list now tops 500 acts stretching back to the 1950s.


  "I’m sure there were many more bands,” said Antler. “This is just the tip of the iceberg.”


  Antler has personnel details for “about half” of the groups on her list. But others, including Free Beer, Goulais River Shovel Band, Smeltzer, Them and Zoom Daddys, have no players listed.


  She wants to wrap up her project by late June and share her findings with Sault Ste. Marie Musuem. Antler credits a music exhibit at the site for spurring her on with her research.


  "I’m not leaving it on the back burner again,” she said. “I’m doing this until I get it done now.”


  Her effort “sounds interesting” to Don Discher.


  "I think it’s a great idea,” said the Northern Ontario County Music Association Hall of Fame inductee.


  He formed his band, The Sundowners, in 1976. Discher has also played with several other groups including Jim Donaldson and The Rebels, Five-Star Country, Fred Kent and The Northernaires and Joe Knight and The Melodiers.


  Paul Leclair worked on creating a similar list of Sault bands a decade ago. His efforts were thwarted by a computer disc that was corrupted, causing the secretary and treasurer of Sault Ste. Marie Musicians’ Association to lose his research that drummed up several hundred groups.


  Leclair is willing to help Antler if she needs assistance.


  "You’re in for a chore,” he said. “It’s a daunting experience.”


  Leclair suggests Antler may want to also consider noting city bars where groups played, including The Black Knight, Eastgate Hotel and Algoma Hotel, that no longer exist.


  "Fifteeen, 20 bars are gone out of this town,” said Leclair. ““It might serve a purpose to go that route.”


  His association used to have a list of “at least” 20 groups that could play weddings. Now, he has three with couples opting for “four hours of continuous thump, thump, thump” at their receptions.


  "The older folks leave within an hour,” said Leclair.

 We knew we were going to miss you, Sharon Bulova. We just didn’t know we were going to miss you so much, so soon.
 Bulova departed as chair of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors in December, succeeded by Jeff McKay. And while it is unfair to try and extrapolate the ultimate impact of McKay based on just a few months – with a public-health crisis thrown in for good measure – we will say that the early signs are not overly promising.
 Bulova could be counted on for common-sense leadership, both in Fairfax and (by dint of the county’s large size) the region as a whole. Most important, from our perspective, she seemed to never take anything at face value, particularly if it was conventional wisdom.
 She asked probing questions, eschewed doctrinaire positions, dressed down those she felt were regurgitating talking points and weighed the opportunity cost – “if we do X, we might not be able to do Y” – when putting together policies and budgets.
 McKay, who got to the top of the ladder the traditional way in Fairfax (having first served as a district supervisor), thus far strikes us as someone of a less independent disposition. We can’t know what goes on behind the scenes, but in the public arena he seems too willing to toe the company line of county staff and regional leaders rather than emerging as someone who leads the largest jurisdiction around, and acts accordingly.

A G-III spokesman said the new arrangement was made "in recognition of record-breaking results" in the 12 months ending in January and to assure stability in management. Signet Jewelers is also giving executives more shares based on time, and less on performance, which could help blunt the impact of the economic crisis on their pay. Time-vesting shares made up 35% of executives' long-term incentive plan before the pandemic, with the balance of the stock awards linked to profitability measures. The new structure gives time-vesting and performance shares equal weighting. The changes mean Signet CEO Virginia Drosos would get $900,000 more in time-based stock awards for this year if Signet maintains compensation targets it used for the previous fiscal year, ended Feb. 1.

Alone in California, Santa Barbara County has allowed self-identified former medicinal marijuana growers to continue operating under “legal, non- conforming” status and temporary state business licenses, so long as they submit applications for county zoning permits and county business licenses. In its lawsuit, the cannabis coalition contends that most of those operations have illegally expanded well beyond their 2015 acreage. But the county doesn’t keep track.


  Only 20 zoning permits have been issued for cannabis cultivation to date, covering 243 acres, according to a quarterly report that was presented to the board on May 19 by the county executive officer. Meanwhile, 189 applications are in the pipeline, most of them listed as “awaiting applicant action,” covering 2,422 acres. That’s hundreds more acres than what the county will ultimately approve permits for: the board has set a cultivation cap of 1,761 acres. There is no deadline for obtaining a permit.

Particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Washington area needs someone at the top of the political food chain who casts a wary eye on government overreach and recognizes that the public health of the region is inextricably linked to its economic health.
 The entire region needs someone who will rise to the occasion, ask the tough questions, buck convention when appropriate and tell it like it is, rather than hide behind staff, statistics and sanctimonious pronouncements.
 Through the years, we have watched Fairfax board chairs Jack Herrity, Audrey Moore, Tom Davis, Kate Hanley, Gerald Connolly and Bulova. Each had strengths and weaknesses, most had to deal with a variety of crises during their tenure, and as we said at the top, it is hard (and would be harsh) to compare McKay so soon.
 That said, the new board chair wasn’t exactly dragged kicking and screaming to the position he is in; he willingly sought and accepted it.
 And for the good of us all in the county and in the region, we sincerely hope that, sooner rather than later, he rises to meet the moment.

Executive Vice President Elise Eberwein said in a memo to employees Wednesday night that nearly 39,000 other employees have signed up for partially paid leave or early retirement, and the airline has extended a buyout offer to administrative staff. Laid-off workers will be paid through Sept. 30 to comply with a no-furloughs provision attached to $5.8 billion in federal aid that American is getting to help cover payroll costs.


  Easyjet said Thursday that it will cut up to a third of its 15,000 employees. It aims to resume limited service on June 15, but estimates that it may take three years for demand to get back to the levels of 2019, before the coronavirus outbreak grounded flights around the world and pushed the global economy toward a deep recession.

Fox said Heirloom is growing 45 acres of cannabis on a 177-acre property. In all, zoning permits are in the pipeline for about 600 acres of cannabis in the Santa Rita Hills, while 3,600 acres are planted in wine grapes – out of a total 31,000 acres in the AVA, most of it in pasture.


  “And we’re being positioned as ‘monster grows’?” Fox said. “There has been a lot of rhetoric, but not a lot of evidence-based facts in this discussion.”


  Yet there have been real losses. At the 99-acre Fiddlestix Vineyard on Santa Rosa Road, Kathy Joseph, the owner and winemaker since 1997, said she had to destroy $80,000 in chardonnay grapes last year, after her spraying operations were found to have contaminated the Central Coast Agriculture cannabis operation next door.

A former county planning commissioner, Benedict blames the county for letting cannabis growers expand without permits. The result is a pervasive atmosphere of conflict and anxiety in the agricultural region, he said, stemming from the smell of marijuana in tasting rooms; the visual blight of industrial-scale cannabis; the fear of potential “taint” to grapes from aromatic compounds in cannabis; and confrontations over pesticides, even organic pesticides, accompanied by letters from cannabis attorneys threatening to sue.


  “The cultural thing is awful.” Benedict said. “A CUP will be a step in the right direction, but I would far rather completely start over from scratch. Being an old planning commissioner, I want the county to do the proper planning first, before it issues entitlements – not the other way around.”

I remember him addressing the media, and he challenged me. I thought he was challenging other Africans, but when I sat down and summarised what he was saying I realised he was talking to me. He said ‘we are very proud of this young man, and he has set a standard for Africans and he showcases what Africa can achieve, and he said ‘I wish other Africans can step up and follow in his footsteps, so the setting of a standard is the one thing that 17 years later still haunts me when he said I have set a standard for Africa.

Graham Farrar, the only cannabis grower in Carpinteria with a county zoning permit, said it would be counterproductive to drag growers through a more time-consuming and expensive permit process. Farrar has all the necessary permits and licenses for seven acres of cannabis under cultivation in greenhouses with roof vents at Glass House Farms on Foothill Road; he still needs permits for his three-acre greenhouse operation on Casitas Pass Road.


  “Moving to a CUP would send all of us back to square one,” Farrar said. “The sooner you permit and fully license folks, the sooner you can penalize someone who doesn’t obey the rules. That’s where you get the control. That’s what I think the community wants.”

We cannot allow the cure to be worse than the disease. We closed down our country in order to bend the curve and make sure we had adequate medical resources. We have accomplished that goal in many places across America.


  We need to open smartly, safely and soon. The health of the nation depends upon it.


  As a result of the lockdowns, people have been forced to postpone important diagnostic and preventative medical procedures. Patients continue to put off doctor visits that could detect life-threatening problems like cancer and heart disease. Many hospital emergency rooms have been eerily empty as patients stayed away if their symptoms were unrelated to coronavirus.


  National headlines call attention to a deepening crisis in mental health care. Loneliness, family upheaval and financial pressures can increase stress, anxiety and unhealthy behavior. A San Francisco-area trauma center reports a year’s worth of suicide attempts in just the past four weeks.


  The risk of abuse goes up. This includes spouse abuse, child abuse and substance abuse. It is all going on today behind closed doors all across our country.


  Pediatricians worry that since children are not in school or day care, a significant numbers cases of child abuse are not being detected or reported.


  We must acknowledge that taking away people’s livelihoods, social supports and educational opportunities has a real negative impact, not just on individuals and families, but on entire communities.
