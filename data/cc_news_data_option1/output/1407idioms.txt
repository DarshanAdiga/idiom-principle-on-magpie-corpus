Wolves’ latest accounts show a large increase in turnover and a return to profit, following the club’s promotion to the Premier League.
 Records for the year ending 31st May 2019 reveal that Wolves achieved a turnover of £172.5million, up from £26.4m the previous year, resulting in a pre-tax profit of £19.9m – after reporting a loss of £57.1m for the 12 months before.
 The period, which reflects the 2018/19 season, was the third campaign under the ownership of Fosun International and the first in the Premier League since 2012. Wolves finished the campaign in seventh place, securing Europa League qualification, as well as reaching the FA Cup semi-finals.
 The increases can be largely attributed to Premier League distributions, with the club receiving £134m in broadcasting income and league distributions compared to only £8m in their Championship promotion season. Money from sponsors, advertising and commercial also jumped from £8.9m to £25.9m.
 Season ticket numbers increased to the maximum available, from 21,233 to 22,500. The average league attendance was up from 28,298 to 31,030, with money from gate receipts also rising from £7.8m to £11.5m.
 The period saw significant investment in the playing squad, including the signings of Joao Moutinho, Adama Traore, Rui Patricio, Diogo Jota, Willy Boly, Ruben Vinagre and Jonny, but player trading for the year generated a profit of £11.9million.
 However, this was cancelled out by higher amortisation and impairment charges on player registrations of £37.7m – resulting in a net player trading loss of £25.8m.
 Wages increased from £50.7m to a relatively modest £92.1m by Premier League terms, meaning Wolves spent only 53 per cent of their income on wages, compared to 192 per cent in the 2017/18 season.
 Fosun International loaned the club a further £57million to cover costs, meaning W.W. (1990), the parent company of the football club and a related property company that owns the stadium development and training facilities, owe Fosun £131million as of the end of last season.
 A statement signed off by the board said Fosun “has indicated its intention to continue to make available such funds as are needed…and that it does not intend to seek repayment of the amounts due at the balance sheet date.”

As Kent State departments continue to search the campus for unused personal protective equipment to donate to Portage emergency response teams, another group of faculty is figuring out how to create it from scratch.  
 For the past several weeks, a team of more than 25 Kent State faculty, staff and students from all corners of the university have been designing, 3-D printing, laser cutting, sewing and testing various forms of face shields and masks, and hope to begin producing on a small scale within the next few weeks. The team will donate all newly created PPE to the Cleveland-based nonprofit MedWish, which will distribute the supplies to front line workers across Northeast Ohio who are feeling the statewide shortage of PPE as coronavirus cases continue to rise.  
 J.R. Campbell, director of the Design Innovation Initiative, is leading the team that includes individuals from the College of Public Health, University Libraries, Research Center for Educational Technology and the College of Architecture and Environmental Design.  
 "We formed as a team very quickly as a result of a convergence of different conversations that were happening. In a flurry of a couple days, a bunch of folks were hopping in. We got a bunch of people who never worked together before all working together to create an agreed set of solutions for how to make PPE devices," Campbell said.  
 The team started analyzing designs made by the University of Florida and the University of Montana and then adapted the designs to make them more comfortable, and easier, quicker and cheaper to produce, pulling inspiration from other designs. They have now settled on a design for the face shield, which is a combination of a 3-D printed headband and a laser-cut sheet that wraps around the face. Each headband takes about two hours to print and Campbell said they have access to close to 20 3-D printers.  
 "We realized there is a time crunch, but we also realize this is not going to stop in two weeks. This is going to be a pandemic that's going to last a couple of months, so if we can start printing five or six per person a day and you have 20 people doing this you can quickly see how those numbers can create a large cache of face masks and shields," said Christopher Woolverton, a professor in the College of Public Health with a background in infectious disease who also serves on the City of Kent's Board of Health as an infectious disease microbiologist.  
 The team is also developing face masks that are similar in structure to the N95 respirators. The masks are made with medical-grade sterilization wraps obtained and donated by MedWish.  
 Woolverton has already fit-tested six to eight models to see if the masks can properly seal and mold to different facial structures and block out particles, and expects to test another 15 to 20 styles soon.  
 Once designs are finalized and production begins, all PPE will be donated to MedWish, a nonprofit that recovers, repurposes and redistributes around 450,000 pounds of discarded medical supplies and equipment in Northeast Ohio every year. MedWish will distribute the supplies to healthcare facilities and organizations that care for vulnerable patients and to individuals on the frontlines based on an application process.  
 "We are trying to provide as much as we can to as many organizations as possible for those who are on the front lines. It's based on requests, and even though we're in Cleveland, we're not just serving Cuyahoga County. We're open to all of Northeast Ohio," MedWish Associate Executive Director Britta Latz said.  
 She said that she hopes to begin receiving the new PPE within the next few weeks.  
 "This is a team that has come about faster than any other large group I've been a part of," Campbell said. "This is something none of us could have done on our own, so to work together to meet a need that also represents our shared values -- that's what design innovation is all about. We've spent many hours on Microsoft Teams debating and discussing designs and the legality of what we're trying to do, but also from a humanitarian sense, how we can meet this need as quickly as possible."  
 Campbell added that once finalized, the designs will be uploaded to Kent's website and will be available to all for free. For more information about MedWish and to apply for their PPE, visit www.medwish.org.

The novel coronavirus continues to expose entrenched racial inequities and disparities that for too long have been given short shrift.
   
 I almost fell off my chair the other day when during one of his daily press briefings, Donald Trump feigned being perplexed by statistics showing African Americans were contracting COVID-19 at a higher rate than whites.
   
 I reacted similarly after learning that State Attorney Bill Cervone refuses to release certain categories of low-level suspected offenders at the Alachua County Jail. The overwhelming majority of inmates -- an astonishing 71% -- are black and confined in conditions that breed the contagious disease. More than 600 inmates are housed in either cells built for two and or in tight dormitory-like quarters .
   
 Both Trump and Cervone seem oblivious to countless studies, which for decades have shown severe health disparities between blacks and other populations. The state attorney need only Google the "Understanding Racial Inequity in Alachua County" report, which was released two years ago, to refresh his memory and see why he needs to be more proactive and less punitive-minded.
   
 The Alachua County study includes empirical evidence that black residents suffer disproportionately from such conditions as diabetes, stroke, heart disease and obesity. These are all "underlying" health conditions that are the biggest contributors to deadly cases of COVID-19.
   
 Too, there remains the persistent problem that too many low-income African Americans still don't have equal access to health care.
   
 These are all reasons why in cities such as Chicago, 72% of COVID-19 deaths are African Americans despite making up just 30% of the city's population. And the Cook County jail in Chicago has now become the largest-known source of U.S. infections, the New York Times reported.
   
 Unlikely that such horror could happen in Gainesville, where some of the greatest racial disparities and inequities in the nation exist? Not when Cervone is limiting his consideration of early jail release to a case-by-case basis, despite at least one jail employee testing positive for the virus.
   
 The state attorney's office recently refused temporary release of a 68-year- old Alachua County man who is a trustee serving a one-year sentence for a non- violent crime and has no other criminal history.
   
 In Levy County, the state objected to releasing an inmate who only had three days remaining on his county jail sentence.
   
 Meanwhile, early release is being led by forward-thinking criminal justice officials in such communities as Tampa and states such as Kentucky and Hawaii.
   
 It should be noted that already at least four inmates and 37 employees at 17 Florida prisons have tested positive for COVID-19. Though it has been reported that panic is setting in at many state prisons, Gov. Ron DeSantis' administration has revealed few details about how it is handling outbreaks. This situation, too, looks like a train wreck waiting to happen.
   
 Locally, Public Defender Stacy Scott has presented Cervone with a reasonable proposal that calls for release of inmates who are within 15 days of completing their sentence. She has also requested that pre-trial inmates, who are non-violent and being held on low bonds, be released to pre-trial supervision.
   
 Cervone's insistence that he won't be swayed by "hysterical words" about a looming crisis at the Alachua County Jail sounds too much like Trump talk. Remember Trump initially dismissed the coronavirus as a "hoax." So far more than 14,000 Americans are dead and at least 418,000 are battling the disease.
   
 With the death count mounting, Trump is finally yielding. It shouldn't have to take avoidable deaths at the county jail for Cervone to act rather than react.

Manchester United eased a little pressure on manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as they battered Tranmere 6-0 on an unhelpful Prenton Park playing surface to reach the FA Cup fifth round.


  Solskjaer’s position has looked increasingly precarious following recent Premier League defeats to Liverpool and Burnley, and a third setback in the space of eight days to a side sitting third bottom in League One would have dramatically escalated the situation.


  But Harry Maguire’s screamer was followed by cool finishes from Diogo Dalot and Jesse Lingard as United scored three times in six first-half minutes while Phil Jones and Anthony Martial also found the net before the interval.


  Matters hardly improved for the hosts after the break as Mason Greenwood struck from the spot, meaning the sides’ second competitive meeting proved even more one-sided than their first – when United won 5-0 in 1977.


  Tranmere had reached this stage by beating a callow Watford three days earlier and, while Solskjaer made six changes to the team beaten by Burnley in midweek, United’s XI was not light on experience as Victor Lindelof, Luke Shaw and Lingard were among those to come back into the side.


  Much of the build-up had centred on the boggy nature of the pitch, which had several bare patches, while both flanks were heavily sanded, but any United concerns soon evaporated once they had taken the lead.


  In a raucous atmosphere and with Morgan Ferrier making a nuisance of himself early on, with Jones booked for hauling down the Tranmere striker, it seemed United would have an onerous afternoon.


  But Maguire’s spectacular 10th-minute opener instantly turned the tide, the United captain scoring his first goal for the club by finding the top corner from outside the area with a thunderous effort that took a slight deflection and left Scott Davies helpless.


  It got even better for the vocal visiting fans three minutes later as Martial played through Dalot, operating further forward than normal, who effortlessly turned past Liam Ridehalgh and coolly slotted across Davies.


  Boyhood Manchester City fan Davies had spoken of his wish to put one over on United but was left to collect the ball out of his net once more with barely a quarter of an hour on the clock.


  Tranmere’s defenders were again guilty of backing off and allowed Lingard to pick his spot, the England midfielder curling into the net from the edge of the box with aplomb.


  Tranmere had battled back from three goals down to grab a draw at Watford in the last round but there was no hint of another improbable comeback as United continued to look menacing any time they went forward and Lingard miscued twice when well placed to increase the lead.


  But United’s fourth duly arrived in the 41st minute as Jones’ looping header at the back post found the net for his first goal in nearly six years, while Martial’s deflected effort from the left side of the box put Solskjaer’s side 5-0 ahead on the stroke of half-time.


  That was the Frenchman’s final contribution on his 200th United appearance as both he and Nemanja Matic were withdrawn, perhaps with the return leg of the Carabao Cup semi-final against Manchester City on Wednesday in mind.


  On came Fred and Tahith Chong, who looked set to get on the scoresheet himself when he poked the ball beyond Davies only to go to ground from the Tranmere custodian’s trailing leg.


  Davies was then sent the wrong way as Greenwood casually side-footed home his 56th-minute penalty as Tranmere were left with more than half an hour to try to avoid even further punishment.


  Lingard hit the outside of the post with another curling effort while Chong rattled the crossbar from an acute angle but, with the result long beyond doubt, United were largely happy to cruise to the final whistle.

You can tell if your presentation is correct because in most cases you will get hammered on the first cast. Feisty wild trout see the wiggling worm, charge the bait, get a quick smell and slam the offering with reckless abandon. Bang! It’s over and the worm is gone, violently ripped off the hook by the savage strike. Be prepared to rebait because hungry trout that did not feel the sting of the hook are almost always eager to strike, sometimes you will go through several worms before you finally get the hook into the hungry fish.

 We were encouraged to read how faculty members from Texas Tech University and the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, and others are working together to stop the spread of the coronavirus by creating 3D-printed face shields and face masks for health care workers.
   
 The West Texas 3D COVID-19 Relief Consortium is a multifaceted group of collaborators hard at work supporting the heroic efforts of health care workers, who are literally on the front lines in the country's battle against a microscopic enemy that has upended life for weeks.
   
 The consortium involves departments at the TTUHSC, Texas Tech, the University of Texas-Permian Basin, Odessa College, local businesses, concerned citizens and aviators. It represents one more remarkable way in which people and entities are coming together and pooling their talents against a common foe.
   
 "The West Texas 3D Printing COVID-19 Relief Consortium is using innovative methods to produce personal protective equipment (PPE), ventilators and ventilator components that will be distributed to hospitals and health care systems in need throughout West Texas," Simon Williams, professor of medical education and cell biology & biochemistry at the TTUHSC, said in our story. Williams also serves as associate dean for academic affairs in the School of Medicine.
   
 As media reports have indicated, there have been cases of health care workers dealing with shortages of critical supplies in the face of the pandemic. This has been especially true in some of the nation's hardest-hit areas where physicians, nurses and caregivers have been working around the clock to care for those struck hardest by the coronavirus.
   
 Williams, Engineering College Dean Al Sacco Jr., Honors College Associate Dean Aliza Wong and John Carrell, assistant professor of engineering in the Honors College were among those working together and investigating ways in which Tech could assist the health care sector.
   
 According to our story, Carrell distributed the print file for the individual pieces that make up face shields along with instructions for obtaining clear shields and assembling them. Tech's School of Theatre and Dance provided elastic material for the straps, and the school's athletic department donated headbands for the face shields.
   
 Thanks to the spirit of cooperation and the more than two dozen 3D printers located throughout the Tech community, the team had enough material to make 350 face shields with an expectation is to produce more. The first 32 were delivered to University Medical Center in late March with several rural partners receiving shipments a few days later.
   
 "We are also working on ventilators and respirators - the masks that filter out the virus," Carrell said in our story. "The shields are the easiest to make right now. A little more work is needed on the design and application on the other two, but the goal is to find a design and then make as many as we can."
   
 West Texas is fortunate to have so many talented and brilliant people in its midst as a result of numerous institutions of higher education. We applaud these inspired efforts that demonstrate the amazing things that can happen at the intersection of compassion and the entrepreneurial spirit.

To date, the lack of banking options for crypto businesses and lack of compliant fiat-to-crypto onramps have presented the largest obstacles to mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency. MoonPay bypasses these obstacles by offering end-users an all-in-one solution that seamlessly connects payment card acquirers, banks, and cryptocurrency exchanges to streamline the purchase of crypto assets. This solution follows strict anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) practices that open the cryptocurrency market up for broader participation and offer much-needed clarity in a shifting regulatory landscape.

Many migrants fly by night, so there's no telling what surprise may be waiting in your yard come morning, tired and hungry and looking for a sheltering spot to rest. I'll never forget the time a reader in south Oshawa sent me a photo of a bizarre-looking, long-legged bird perched in his apple tree: a least bittern, a highly secretive wetland species I'd never seen before. It stayed all day, unmoving, so my husband got to see it on his way home from work, though I wasn't able to. I finally got it as a 'lifer' a decade later, when one flew up briefly from a cattail marsh way up the Bruce Peninsula -- this rare bird's usual habitat.

"
 After having our lives severely restricted for the last month, some of us are beginning to wonder if this extreme curtailment of normal American life is still necessary to address the coronavirus pandemic. Some public health professionals are using new data to recommend a different course to protect both health and the global economic future.
 But first, it is appalling that so many ninny-nannies are chiming in to criticize President Donald Trump's leadership amid the pandemic. To compare Trump's actions to President Barack Obama's is specious at best. While Obama may have held a meeting to discuss possible responses to public health risks, it should be remembered that it was under the Obama administration that funding for emergency health supplies was cut, thus leaving our nation vulnerable to what we are facing today.
 So, why are we taking the extreme path we are currently on? When dealing with an emergency situation, good emergency managers must constantly evaluate the situation, note changes and adapt as quickly as possible. The original method was defined as the \"OODA (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act, then repeat) Loop\" by U.S. Air Force Col. John Boyd, known as the fighter pilot who redefined modern warfare. This is now a standard business philosophy.
 The point is Trump and his expert advisers can only make decisions by analyzing the data presented to them. In the early stages of a pandemic the data will not be 100% accurate or useful, but it is all we had. As more information is reported and analyzed, corrections to course should be made quickly.
 Epidemiologist Dr. John Ioannidis from Stanford University and others are now saying that the drastic action we are now taking may not be needed in the light of new, more complete data.
 Not all countries compile disease information in the same way. For example, one European country assigns cause of death of a patient with COVID-19 -- the disease caused by the coronavirus -- if the patient was infected even though the patient had other life-ending illnesses. In other words, the patient was at death's door to start with.
 It now appears that a reevaluation of America's drastic shutdown is warranted.
 We must consider what the long-term benefit to shutting down our economy as opposed to the long-term cost thereof? Sweden did not shut down but cautioned it citizens to take extra steps to prevent the spread of the virus. There has been no catastrophe there.
 Many states such as Iowa have few cases and do not need to take the same measures as New York City. The point is, the shutdown is also killing us economically.
 The unemployment rate today is likely higher than any point since the Great Depression, according to the New York Times, with the Labor Department reporting last week that almost 10 million Americans applied for unemployment insurance in the previous two weeks. The long-term effects may include the loss of thousands of businesses, compounded poverty, severe mental health issues dealing with loss of income and homes and shortened life expectancy.
 The economic consequences of long-term and repeated shutdowns are very dire indeed. Congress approved and Trump signed a massive $2 trillion emergency pandemic package that included Democrat-added funding for frivolous areas such as fine arts and pet projects plus attempts to revise the voter law.
 We are at a cross-road. All this massive spending must be paid for at some time. So, remember how much of our debt communist China holds.

The Port of Seattle has ruled out resumption of cruises here until at least July or “the end of this public health emergency.” The summer cruise season is credited with generating nearly $900 million in business activity and supporting 5,500 jobs, according to the port.

 "We're not dealing with post 9/11 where people were afraid for their safety when traveling beyond U.S. borders," said Stewart Chiron, who reviews cruises on his website CruiseGuy. "Many people are ready to sail once a clear timeline for resumption of service and current ship schedules are revealed."

Pandemic. Do we panic? Why don’t we? I believe it’s hope. The hope for our future or our family’s future. Watching the reactions and the mob mentality is fascinating. Hysteria, hype, extremes, high and low. Observing the media and watching the endless streams of information make me grateful to be in a community like Telluride. We have banded together and are being smart and proactive in our initiatives, and it makes me proud. We know what’s at stake, and we are doing our best with the information we have.
 The coolest part about living out here, first in Ouray and now Telluride, was learning the history. Coming from Cherokee heritage, it was very purposeful for me to connect with the history of Ouray, Chief Ouray and his wife Chipeta.
 For me, it was about history and resiliency and resourcefulness … and hope. For me, it was seeing what another indigenous tribe faced and dealt with in the face of adversity and change. And how the landscape and generations were affected so many years later. Telluride was founded a mere 142 years ago in 1878, and San Miguel County was the first county in the United States of America to be tested for free as a whole for a virus. What pioneers. If we succeed in drastically reducing the spread we will be known again for a different type of pioneering. I am proud of the non-partisan response and our schools and businesses doing what is right to protect our community, and our leadership for responding in such a focused and tactical manner. Being calm, rational and deliberate is critical as we use intelligence, safe practices and science to help all of humanity.

Wolves could be willing to offload Ryan Bennett ahead of Friday’s transfer deadline.
 The defender has interest from the Premier League, Championship and SPL, the PA news agency understands.
 Bennett has fallen out of favour under boss Nuno Espirito Santo and it remains a possibility he could leave Molineux in the next 48 hours.
 The 29-year-old has been left out of the last two squads and has not made an appearance since the 2-1 defeat at Watford on New Year’s Day.
 Young defender Max Kilman has moved ahead of him in the pecking order recently while Willy Boly is now fit after recovering from a fractured ankle.
 But Wolves have allowed Jesus Vallejo’s loan from Real Madrid to be cut short and the defender joined Granada earlier this month.
 The centre-back’s exit could convince the club to hang on to Bennett, yet he has started just three of their last 20 league games.
 He featured 34 times in the top flight last year but has struggled to nail down a place this season with Leander Dendoncker and Romain Saiss preferred ahead of him and has 18 months left on his current deal.
 Bennett joined on a free from Norwich in 2017, winning the Sky Bet Championship in 2018, before helping Wolves to the Europa League in their first season back in the Premier League last term.
 The former Peterborough trainee has made 92 appearances, scoring three times.
 Meanwhile, Wolves are closing in on Olympiakos winger Daniel Podence.
 The 24-year-old is set for a £16.9million move which could be completed on Thursday.
 Podence will help boost an attacking line-up depleted after Patrick Cutrone joined Fiorentina on loan earlier this month.
 Podence had a medical on Wednesday while Wolves’ interest in AEK Athens forward Nelson Oliveira has cooled.
 They have failed to meet his release clause of €6.5million after an offer of €4.5million was rejected late last week.
 Wolves have signed teenage midfielder Enzo Loiodice on loan from Dijon for the rest of the season with an option to buy.
 The 19-year-old France Under-20 international, who has made 24 senior appearances for the Ligue 1 club, will go straight into the Under-23s squad at Molineux.
 Loiodice told the club’s official website: “I’m very happy to be here. Wolves are a great team, they play in the Premier League and for all football players growing up in France, the Premier League is the biggest championship, so I’m very proud to be here.
 “I’ve watched some of the Wolves games and there is a way to play here which I like, and although I know coming here is going to be difficult, I want to work hard, learn English football, play as many games as I can and then we will see what happens.”

The coronavirus pandemic left dozens of cruise ships temporarily stranded at sea, not allowed to dock because of onboard outbreaks of the deadly virus.
 It happened with the Norwegian Jewel in the South Pacific, the Zaandam off the coast of Florida and the Grand Princess in the waters off Northern California, among several others.
 Despite such harrowing news, Chris Schuck, hasn't canceled three cruises he has booked over the next two years, with the earliest in September.
 "After this virus, I truly believe the cruise lines will institute even more guidelines to keep guests and crew safe," said Schuck, who works in the scheduling and labor department at Walt Disney World in Florida.
 Schuck isn't the only cruise fan who remains faithful. Travel agents and industry experts say bookings for cruise sailings in 2021 are up considerably compared with pre-coronavirus data.
 Cruise lines that canceled sailings in the last few months have offered refunds or credits toward future trips. Still, travel agents and experts say the booking rates for cruise trips in 2021 represent more than just passengers rebooking their canceled trips.

DEAR EDITOR:
 We need to tell our Congress people and senators to take the foot off the gas with respect to spending. Hopefully the worst of this coronavirus will be over before too much debt is added to fill Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Shumer’s wish list. Remember Obama’s “shovel ready jobs” that weren’t so shovel ready. Rather than getting immediate relief to the average American, Nancy Pelosi was trying to put items of the Green New Deal and spending for the Kennedy Center when the average American needed a few bucks for food and a mortgage payment or two.
 The economy has a long way to go to pay off Obama’s $9 trillion addition to the national debt. We need a boost to keep our economy going and get people over the bump in regards to basically shutting down the economy to isolate people from the coronavirus. We need to protect ourselves from a disease that got out of hand due to the Chinese lying about how serious this disease is. Remember the Chinese turned a ship back to China with supplies that were to treat the coronavirus. The Chinese want to control the world both economically and militarily. We do not want to help China achieve that goal. What was Congress doing when this disease was starting? Trying to impeach the president over a hoax.

 The reins of the Amarillo Fire Department have been passed to Jason Mays, who on April 1 officially was named the 10th chief in the department's history. For Mays, serving the city in this important and highly visible role is a dream come true.
   
 He succeeds Jeff Greenlee, who announced his decision to retire in January. Like Chief Greenlee, Mays has come up through the department's ranks during the past 21 years. He has served in a number of roles and learned all along the way for a 360-degree perspective. Likewise, he has a firm grasp on operational and strategic details and a thorough understanding of the department's internal culture.
   
 His career was enriched as a result of moving from working inside a fire station to administrative duties as a departmental training captain. He has been appreciative of each professional opportunity to continue learning and growing.
   
 "It's that perspective you gain each time you spend years, and you rotate, and you move," he said in our story earlier this week. "Change is the only consistent in the fire service and in this world. Through that, everywhere you go, the light gets a little brighter. You are able to see a little more."
   
 Mays joined the Amarillo Fire Department in 1999 and took over officially as chief on Wednesday (April 8). He brings impressive credentials to the position and is eager to ensure the department continues on the positive trajectory established during Greenlee's tenure. In fact, Mays spent time regularly the past few years learning from Greenlee and getting a feel for the contours and demands of the job.
   
 "He has managed in almost all of the different areas of the department and is very well versed in everything we do," City Manager Jared Miller said in announcing the decision. "He is well-versed in the culture here. We have a very professional, a very highly motivated, well-equipped group."
   
 Mays played an important role in helping carry out the mission and vision of Greenlee in positioning the department for success over the long term and making the department an appealing destination for firefighters. One of the secrets to Greenlee's success was empowering people to be successful, something Mays plans to make sure continues.
   
 He also has his sights set on continuing to increase the overall vitality of the department through training and equipment decisions. An early goal, according to our story, is raising the standard of the area's emergency medical services (EMS) care, especially during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. "We still want to raise the bar on how we provide EMS care in the city as a first responding agency," he said.
   
 Mays wants to make sure the department remains accessible to the community in terms of engaging with the public through events and means other than responding to fire calls.
   
 We congratulate Chief Mays on his new position and wish him well as he settles into the role. We are thankful for all of our first responders, especially during this time of uncertainty, and appreciate how each day the fire department strives to live up to its mission statement: "To protect our community by providing the highest quality of compassionate and professional services."

Bristol City head coach Lee Johnson urged his players to keep calm heads as the team moved into sixth place in the Sky Bet Championship with a 1-0 victory at Reading.
 City created little in a poor first-half display, with goalkeeper Daniel Bentley having to make a smart save from John Swift’s fierce 20-yard drive.
 But they grabbed the goal that clinched their third successive league win when Jamie Paterson tucked home from close range in the 62nd minute.
 City had to survive late Reading pressure, with Yakou Meite striking a post and Ashley Williams having to clear off the goalline from Chris Gunter.
 “There were some interesting results tonight,” Johnson said. “That’s the Championship, it’s competitive.
 “There’s an awful lot to play for here and it’s not just us. There’s going to be six or seven teams behind us going for the play-offs.
 “We’re not the finished article but you can see our spirit.
 “But we mustn’t get too ahead of ourselves. Bristol has this way of building it all up and then can knock it down very quickly as well.
 “I thought that we started brightly tonight and the players applied everything that we worked on in training.
 “I don’t think that the clean sheet is a fluke because it’s the third one in three.
 “The defending work that we have been doing has been outstanding.
 “Sometimes it’s just a case of having to weather the storm, which we had to do in the last 10 minutes.
 “I was disappointed that we didn’t tidy up the play a bit better then and I think that, by the end, even our fans were clearing the ball off the line and trying to will us to the win.”
 Reading have now failed to win in four league matches.
 “It was a close game, I always thought that one goal was going to decide it,” Mark Bowen, the Reading manager, said.
 “But I thought that we were lethargic and slow in starting the game.
 “We should have stamped our authority on the opposition but I don’t think we did that.
 “For their goal, two of their midfield runners ran past us. We were day dreaming, we were not concentrating.
 “Well, I hope it’s that and not the (lack of) desire to run back. If it is that, then I’ve got to do something about it.
 “We tried to come back, we got a lot of crosses into their box.
 “You could say maybe we were unlucky not to equalise but, overall, we didn’t show enough character on or off the ball.
 “I still thought that a draw would have been a fair result but, from my point of view, it was disappointing that we did not show enough to win the game.”

Research and development activity creates new knowledge solves problems. As we cope with COVID-19 and consider recovery there is R&D opportunity at home, through our businesses and via laboratory type endeavors at Idaho State University. R&D activity is valuable and prompts over $400 billion in business investment annually. Common wisdom suggests that there are two drivers of research and development activity. One says, “necessity is the mother of invention.” Another driver is curiosity.
 If you’re working at home in a relatively secure job, you may have some extra time to think about how to improve work processes, eliminate waste or delight customers better when normal work activity resumes. You can write down and map out your thoughts. Maybe web-based research can help find more information that can lead to better application of your ideas for new methods, products or services in your business. If your enterprise is collaborative and your idea is for the common good, then web and phone tools like Zoom and FaceTime enable some show-and-tell with colleagues who may work together with you to get the idea ready to implement when regular work can resume. Coronovirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (CARES) legislation may lead to support you need.

I’m not surprised by general support of the great shutdown by progressives, although they worry about government surveillance (so do some conservatives as we have seen in the Journal). Progressives believe there is a great danger the benefits of the $2 trillion stimulus bill will be given to the rich and the corporations. Little stimulus fund will end up with the unemployed student, fast food and restaurant workers, supermarket checkers, cleaners and stockers, and particularly the now huge population of gig workers.
 There is some similarity between progressive and Republican critics, and if they were willing there could be a movement to bring left and right together, not that I advocate it.
 For example, when would be a better time to end the internationalist rape of the planet (for the left) and stopping its assault on American sovereignty (for the right)?
 The woeful preparation of America for this crisis is not a failure of Trump alone. It is a failure of free market (neoliberal) capitalism with its total emphasis on profits in the short run.
 Progressives hate this kind of capitalism because of the unfair distribution of wealth and its single minded pursuit of profit for shareholders with no concern for public health, community, the American economy (as opposed to international capital) and the climate/environment.
 Many conservatives have argued that free market capitalism results in destruction of traditional religion, morality and the family. Nihilism grows with the only purpose for life becoming acquisition. Love of country cannot survive in the infertile soil left by multinational corporations. An occasional American conservative will even notice that the capitalist land of the free ruins the beautiful American countryside.
 I could add more, but I doubt any coming together will happen. This is not necessarily because ideology won’t allow it. It is mostly because one man prevents it — Donald Trump. His partisan following is not the same as an ideological following. It is the following of a man, not what his momentary political philosophy appears to be.
 On March 30, Trump abruptly changed has tack on the pandemic. From his three- month old mantra of “we have it under control, “the virus will soon disappear” and "flu is so much worse than COVID-19 that we don’t even notice it,” he suddenly turned to a tactical pessimism.
 As the New York Times explained it, “The numbers the health officials showed President Trump were overwhelming. With the peak of the coronavirus pandemic still weeks away, he was told, hundreds of thousands of Americans could face death if the country reopened too soon” (NYT, March 30).
 This president could change yet again, but his latest movement is to suddenly start urging a lot of untested drugs as things people can take to prevent COVID-19 infection or to cure it. This is coupled with a lot of testimonials in the news from people who say they helped. Of course, those who weren’t helped get no story, which likely explains the drugs’ effectiveness — it’s an illusion created one-sided reporting.
 Trump has especially promoted the old drug hydroxychloroquine, which is used effectively for inflammatory arthritis, lupus and Sjogens disease. By creating an unnatural demand for it, Trump has done one thing, hundreds of thousands of patients it does help have had their beneficial drug stolen from them. I know personally, and every day I curse him.

The other thing I do when I talk with reporters is to be straight. I try not to deceive them or to be defensive, because those are precisely the ways most people get themselves into trouble with the press. Instead, when a reporter asks me a tough question, I try to frame a positive answer, even if that means shifting the ground. For example, if someone asks me what negative effects the world’s tallest building might have on the West Side, I turn the tables and talk about how New Yorkers deserve the world’s tallest building, and what a boost it will give the city to have it again. When a reporter asks why I build only for the rich, I note that the rich aren’t the only ones who benefit from my buildings. I explain that I put thousands of people to work who might otherwise be collecting unemployment, and that I add to the city’s tax base every time I build a new project. I also point out that buildings like Trump Tower have helped spark New York’s renaissance.

ROME TOWNSHIP, Ohio — Catchers often make good coaches.
 Fairland High School’s Bryan DeFoe plans to add his name to the list of stellar backstops who went on to lead championship teams.
 DeFoe committed to Shawnee State University on Wednesday. He helped the Dragons to an Ohio Valley Conference championship last season when he batted .259 and reached base at a .474 clip while playing stellar defense and controlling opponents’ running game. Fairland finished 17-5 overall and 12-2 in the OVC.
 “It’s close to home so my family and friends can come watch us play,” DeFoe said.
 DeFoe said he plans to major in sports management with the goal of becoming a coach or athlete development specialist.
 Securing a scholarship was important for DeFoe, a senior whose season has been at best postponed and possibly canceled because of COVID-19. The coronavirus cost DeFoe his senior season during which he hoped to showcase his talent to potential college recruiters.

Newcastle owner Mike Ashley is in ongoing talks with two other potential buyers amid claims that a Saudi consortium is close to a deal, the PA news agency understands.
 The Sports Direct magnate’s representatives are understood to be continuing takeover negotiations with both parties despite the emergence over the weekend of details of a £340million proposal funded in large part by the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund.
 Ashley returned from a trip to the United States on Monday to find the club embroiled in fresh speculation over its future ownership. Its source was a report in the Wall Street Journal suggesting the Saudi group, spearheaded by Amanda Staveley and backed in the main by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s immense wealth, had been in discussions with Ashley for around four months.
 Fresh details have emerged since outlining the structure of the bid – the Reuben brothers, David and Simon, are said to be partners, while businessman Yasir Al-Rumayyan would reportedly be installed as chairman at St James’ Park – with reports claiming an agreement is “90 per cent” likely to be reached.
 However, an exasperated Ashley returned to his desk distinctly unimpressed that the matter had been made public, having stated in no uncertain terms following the collapse of Staveley’s previous bid to take over the club two years ago, that all future business would be conducted behind firmly closed doors.
 With sources close to the sportswear tycoon having indicated talks with other prospective buyers are continuing, he appears to be challenging the Saudis to make a decisive move with a less than subtle shot across their bows.
 In the meantime, fans who have hoped to see the back of Ashley for much of his tenure are refusing to allow themselves to be carried away, and their scepticism is understandable in the wake of failed attempts by Staveley’s PCP Capital Partners, former Manchester United and Chelsea chief executive Peter Kenyon and the Bin Zayed Group to take the club off his hands.
 The latest development, however, may do little to persuade those who believe he does not genuinely want to sell that they are mistaken.
 Also, Amnesty International’s response to news of the latest Staveley-led approach has added further complexities to a long-running saga.
 Amnesty’s UK head of campaigns Felix Jakens branded the reported move “sportswashing” and an attempt to deflect attention from Saudi Arabia’s “abysmal” human rights record – a political issue which might come into play if and when Premier League approval were to be sought.

The nose fits and makes the bumper more pleasing to the eye. The rear though.... I haven't seen anything to make the rear look any better than the stock bumpers. When the roll pan was done on the orange one above or Scott's Rods tucked bumper is installed, there just seems to be something missing when you look at it. That's just me I guess.

I was brought up catching trout in cedar swamp creeks and small streams with deep undercut banks and log jams that held wary wild trout. In most cases there is no need to get in the water, make waves, and allow fish to see you, spook and ruin any chances at having fun catching trout. The trick is to walk upstream, slow down, ease into casting position and stay out of sight from the sharp vision of wild fish. Keep in mind trout spot fast movement with ease and if you stomp along the bank like a mall shopper in a hurry to hit bargains or step along the bank with the power of a military parade, trout will feel the vibration and disappear. Those who slow their pace, sneak into position like a fox ready to pounce on a mouse will have more bites and catch more fish.

The COVID-19 pandemic could cost San Diego Unified School District $71 million — $19 million for the rest of this school year and up to $52 million for summer school, to make up for learning lost during school closures, according to new district estimates.
 “What we’re concerned about is the number of students who are gonna be falling behind as a result of the distance learning,” said San Diego Unified Board Vice President Richard Barrera.
 The $52 million assumes every district student would take summer school, which would not be universally required so the actual cost likely won’t be as much.
 These costs are beyond what the district was anticipating prior to the pandemic. Back then the district was planning to make $84 million in budget cuts to make ends meet over the next school year.
