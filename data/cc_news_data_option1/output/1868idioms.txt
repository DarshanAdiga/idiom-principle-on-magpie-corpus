Okay; so we move to the next slide, in Services. Well, the -- probably the first news that you may have seen is that, in terms of the pending authorizations, the Australian Competition Commission gave the green light. We are only pending in terms of authorizations, the FIRB, the Foreign Investment Review Board's approval, and there's really nothing else. This is the, let's say, the only part pending for closing. And really, the rest is kind of in the back burner, I mean, ready to start when the economies reopen, but of course, we'll have to see how bidders that were looking at different subsets of our portfolio before COVID-19 started, how they come back, if they need to see how they trade.

Last year the Contango Oil & Gas (MCF) made two significant purchases that changed the company's strategy. This year, management will be "thinking outside the box" to generate some free cash flow as well as better than expected earnings.
 "Really the only asset class in the oil and gas industry, which isn't decreased in value in the last month, is latent storage capacity which we have in spades."
 Source: Contango Oil & Gas Fourth Quarter Conference Call March 2020.
 Management is looking at some decent returns by producing the oil now and then storing it until prices are better. There are couple of ways to "hedge" by locking in the profit now from the contango that exists in the futures curve. Management would basically forgo current cash flow (and build inventory by utilizing some ample storage capacity) in the hopes of making a lot more cash in the future. Management estimates that this strategy could make anywhere from 20% to 75% profit from the current price.
 Management did not sit still after the acquisitions. Instead management hedged production in the fall. So most of the anticipated production has been hedged. Any cash flow against that hedged amount will most likely be used to reduce debt. The capital budget has been stripped to only the most necessary work needed.
 One of the biggest differences between the prior management and the new management is the priority to repay debt asap. This management is actually somewhat debt averse. Therefore a piece of whatever cash flow is available will go towards reducing the debt load. The previous management never reduced the debt until it became absolutely necessary. That treatment of debt nearly led to a reorganization.

Yes he is all of those things Troy. But we have seen the worst version of Trump because of the ultratoxic environment the Democrats and leftist media created. He fought fire with fire. They have lied, distorted and exaggerated any semblance of truth. The Mueller probe, the deranged biased media ridicule, deep state resistance and the constant leaks have been more than any President has endured before. It started before he even came to office. We have therefore seen a constantly wounded bull of a President, floundering gracelessly in a swamp of hatred, lashing out and without the clear air to establish any dignity in office. So if you rewrite this piece, perhaps include those aspects to qualify some of the critique. You have missed an entire dimension of the story by omitting them. They helped create Bad Donald but he really got that economy hopping like few before him and he cut through in many areas of the culture wars and international affairs where few could have. At the end of the day I will be cheering for him because he stood up to the bullies, liars, virtue signalling elites and arrogant swamp dwellers who think they control our world.

CAPE TOWN – Municipalities, many of them already in dire financial straits, are now under even more pressure due to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis.
 The South African Local Government Association (Salga) is warning that municipal revenue from rates could fall by 5% – an amount of about R14 billion – due to the lockdown.
 Salga told Parliament’s select committee on appropriations on Wednesday that the longer the lockdown lasts, the higher the impact would be, as households struggled to make ends meet.
 Municipalities are at the forefront of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic but are buckling under the pressure. About 34% of the country’s 257 municipalities ended the year with their books in the red.
 Billions of rand are owing for water and electricity and Salga is worried that the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown will see more municipalities falling into a debt trap.
 “In terms of the preliminary numbers that have been submitted it is projected that there will be a five percent drop in the payment of rates, and it will cost municipalities about R14 billion,” said Salga’s chief officer for municipal finance, Khomotso Letsatsi.
 Letsatsi said depending on how long the lockdown lasts, this number could increase.
 “Economic activity could basically drop to around minus six percent and obviously, that would come with consequences for the sector and the financial sustainability of the sector,” Letsatsi said.

From the strange but true file. Dinger's Believe It or Not.
 First, questions.
 Anybody up for some Dilaudid, some Dillies? How about Diazepam, a little Dexedrine? How about a pack of smokes, some weed and a bottle of Crown Royal?
 Backers of the discredited but still existing drug sites now have another brainwave.
 Hold on to your wallets.
 They want taxpayer-funded drugs for addicts. Say what?
 And they go to Dr. Deena Hinshaw, Alberta's top public health doc, to get them.
 You've got to hand it to them. They give it the old college try.
 But they are politically out to lunch.
 Hinshaw, leading the charge on COVID-19, will take no detour from her fight- the-pandemic route. She has enough crap to deal with these days.
 She will play no part in this bun fight.
 Maybe the Change the Face of Addiction group writing the Dear Doctor letter to her just thought Hinshaw would be an easier mark than Premier Jason Kenney.
 Would love to be a fly on the wall seeing them try to sell the premier on their scheme. Would pay to see that.
 But here we are wading through COVID-19. Under cover of this calamity, everybody under the sun seems to plead their cause.
 Including the drug site crowd with their latest request.
 Full disclosure.
 They detest me. I do not detest them.
 I just believe neighbourhoods should not be sacrificed to drug addicts. I believe people should not fear walking the streets they once considered safe. I believe individuals should not have to worry about having themselves or their property attacked.
 Hardly a radical position -- or heartless.
 In the letter to Hinshaw, the group wants the doc to consider what they call a safer drug supply for Albertans who do drugs.
 "At a time when creative solutions are needed to keep physical distance from others, it makes good sense."
 They say the government paying out for some heavy-duty drugs would make it "more feasible for people to shelter in place while being able to access the substances they need."
 In other words, addicts will be able to isolate and chase their high.
 They point to B.C. where it goes on. Figures.
 In B.C., addicts of all kinds who are "at risk of COVID-19 infection" can get a 23-day prescription of drugs like Dilaudid, Dexedrine and Diazepam.
 For convenience, the prescription does not end on a weekend and the prescriber helps find a delivery option, as in home delivery.
 There's also provision for cannabis, booze and cigarettes.
 Back to the letter. It says physical distancing is "impractical to a demographic that has been routinely cautioned to never use alone."
 The group expects "supply chains for illicit drugs will be interrupted."
 They think prices for illegal drugs could potentially go up along with crime and there would be "a higher probability of drug toxicity."
 More contaminated drugs.
 Result: more lives lost.
 There's a lot of talk of what they expect to happen and what they think could happen.
 Others say they don't have the evidence on their side.
 When the letter gets into talk of "a paradigm shift" and "applying a health care lens" to addiction, the water gets pretty muddy.
 They ask Hinshaw to "take into consideration how access to a safer supply of substances is a concern not only during COVID-19 but every day for vulnerable people."
 There are others who think these folks have cooked up one cockamamie concoction.
 Some docs recently expressed "grave concerns" about this plan and the risk of harm to addicts and the rest of us.
 The provincial government already have ways to support people in withdrawal and in treatment and even have drugs like methadone, all of it not involving the willy-nilly handing out of dope.
 And how expensive would it be for the taxpayers of Alberta to assume the role of drug dealer and pick up the hefty tab?
 Have no fear.
 Around suppertime Tuesday, Jason Luan, Kenney's point man on addiction, ends the mystery and restores sanity.
 In fact, he lays down the law like the dad who comes home and tells the out- of-line kids to go to bed.
 Luan says the Kenney government is "not entertaining any proposals using taxpayer money to buy drugs to sustain any form of addiction."
 He adds they're "laser-focused" on helping addicts to get on the path to treatment and recovery.
 "Anything less than that will not be considered by this government."
 Lights out.

 Yardwork is going slowly but purposefully. I thought I'd been diligent about following my notes from last season, but I slipped up and forgot to check the lilies when they began to emerge. Last season the leaves of both my Asiatic and Oriental lilies were chewed to shreds by the red lily beetle (Lilioceris lilii), a leaf beetle that eats the leaves, stem, buds and flowers of true lilies, fritillaries and other members of the family Liliaceae. These beetles were accidentally introduced into the Boston area in 1992 and have spread to all New England states.
 The beetle is about quarter-inch long and bright, scarlet red. They are easy to see, but they are fast and difficult to catch. (I've gotten better at it because I've had a lot of practice!) If they sense you are approaching, they drop to the ground on their backs and vanish into the soil.
 There is one generation of these beetles per year. The adults overwinter in the soil and emerge in April and May to begin feeding, mating and laying eggs. Each female can lay up to 450 eggs over three or four weeks. The tiny orange- brown eggs are laid on rows on the underside of the lily leaves, and the larvae begin hatching one to two weeks later. The larvae are disgusting; they are soft and slug-like, but that's not the worst of it. To protect themselves, they carry their excrement on their backs which makes them less desirable to predators.
 After hatching, larvae feed for a couple of weeks, causing the most damage to lilies during this stage. Younger larvae usually feed in groups on the underside of leaves while older larvae and adults feed on leaves, stems, buds and flowers. Larvae pupate in the soil beneath their host plants and emerge a few weeks later as adults, which then feed for about two weeks, after which the adults go underground to overwinter in the soil or plant debris until they emerge to mate and lay eggs the following spring.
 I stopped growing lilies for about eight years because of this destructive pest. In 1999, University of Rhode Island Professor of Entomology Richard Casagrande, one of my instructors in the Master Gardener program several years previous, was conducting research into the biological control of the lily leaf beetle. The intent was to introduce parasitoids from the beetle's native range in Europe. These parasitoids would lay their eggs in the larvae of the lily leaf beetle, which eventually die as the parasitoid offspring mature.
 In 1999, these parasitoids were released throughout parts of New England (locally from Elm Bank in Wellesley, home to the Massachusetts Horticultural Society) and Canada. By 2004 there was noticeable reduction in the population, which is when I began growing lilies again.
 After several years of seeing no red lily beetles, I became complacent and did not do my regular leaf check early in the spring. Last year the red devils ate heartily with no intervention from me until late June, so it was no surprise that I would have a problem with them again this year.
 I picked off and disposed of at least two dozen yesterday and found another half-dozen mating this morning. While they have done damage to both the Oriental and Asiatic varieties, the Asiatics have sustained far more damage. I will be much more diligent going forward so I don't have a continued problem in the future. Also, I went through a half-roll of wet Bounty paper towels to clean off the larvae on the leaves last June - a very tedious process - and I don't want to have to repeat that exercise. So far, the eggs that have been laid on the back of the leaves have been minimal.
 If you are growing any type of true lily - Oriental, Asiatic, Orienpet or species - you should check your plants now. (Don't worry about daylilies (Hemerocallis) because they are not true lilies.) If you see chewed leaves or bright red beetles, grab a bowl of warm water, add some dish soap and go bug hunting. Knock the beetles into the suds and then force them down into the water so they don't escape. Check the undersides of the leaves and wipe any bright orange-brown eggs with a damp paper towel. Check periodically.

The above relationship is very interesting to hone in on because it essentially shows that, on average, a fund which starts a trade month holding the front contract will see a degree of losses as the futures prices converge towards the spot price of natural gas.
 If you recall, UNG’s methodology is holding exposure in this front-month contract and then shifting it to the second-month contract about two weeks prior to expiry. This tangibly means that UNG is basically long the blue line (M1 to Spot) until it starts rolling into the red line (M2 to M1) around trade date 10-12 or so. Over this time period, the front contract differential to spot declines by about 1% in an average month.
 You can annualize this figure to get a rough approximation as per the losses seen from roll yield. Based on this simple convergence analysis above, it would suggest that UNG loses a little over 1% per month due to roll yield (or around 12% per year) based on the historical convergence between futures and spot.
 It’s really important to drive this point home: this simple analysis of how futures behave shows that you need natural gas prices to increase by 12% simply to break even in most years in an investment in UNG, due simply to roll yield.
 Now let’s examine UNL. The fund holds this front contract as well, but it also holds the next 11 so that it has exposure across the front 12 months. This is very beneficial for holders in that much of the roll yield losses are removed due to the fact that futures rolling towards spot tends to be most dramatic at the front of the curve.
 To understand what this means, look back at the prior chart. If you look carefully, there is a marked difference between the lines of shorter duration and those of longer duration. For example, while the M1 to Spot line decreases by about 1% over the course of the month, the M4 to M1 line is actually flat to slightly up during the month.
 What the above chart essentially shows is that as you broaden your exposure to later points out along the futures curve, the impact of roll yield is diminished, since these later contracts don’t converge towards the spot price to the same magnitude as the front of the curve.

Mr Bramston falls for the lethal trap of expecting President Donald Trump to be somebody he’s not, somebody he will never be. Donald Trump is not a politician per se, he’s never gone through the traditional political pathways. That said, he’s remained the person he’s always been, manic, no off switch, no filter, thought bubbled, narcissistic, full on, in your face… we have a good grasp he’s not your regular President in outward behaviour, But is he really different from Kevin Rudd and Malcolm Turnbull? Both display all the traits but place the political facade for the people when in office. President Trump has never behaved with that false facade of “better” behaviour. He never will Is that a good thing or not? Regardless of the answer Donald Trump will remain Donald Trump. Whilst he has been uneven during this difficult time, overall America is a different country to Australia. Lots of movement, obsessive about their civil rights, lots of airports and ports. The Governors play a key role and whilst New York has suffered badly their Governor has been praised for his performance. Seems he has because he’s a Democrat and not a Republican like Donald Trump. And there’s the rub. If Donald Trump was a Democrat and President notwithstanding all his behaviours the media would lap him up and say he’s a wonderful breath of fresh air. He is open in his thought bubbles, making everyone think outside the circle The media would say sure he could be a less abrasive type but overall he just gets things done. And they’d laud him for playing with those nasty Republicans’ heads. Unfortunately the chronic partisanship has been a virus in politics. President is far from perfect, he is at times a badly behaved individual, but not every single thing he does is wrong. Far from it But the media have cried wolf so often that today’s complaints of President Trump are largely ignored by those less interested in partisanship.

Okay. Thanks for the question. Well -- no -- really, what happened is that, in places like Poland, Budimex, for instance, really didn't get a lot of advanced payments at the end of 2019. And it has been producing well, weather has been good and days of -- payment by clients, days of collection have been short. So it has been a very good performance that, as I said, I mean, is partially related to some advanced payments, but most of it is really good days of collection and good cash generation, because of good production and shorter days of collection generally across the board, right? So here, if that keeps playing, because public clients keep paying in shorter days, that would help. Of course, if activity slows down because of COVID, clients ask to stop performance that could affect, for instance, in Spain, not in other countries.

The State Department also fails when its diplomats propose diplomacy for its own sake but lose sight of America’s broader interests. During the George H. W.

Diplomats who criticize as unrealistic and poison to productive diplomacy the twelve demands on Iran put forward by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo ignore the fact that to agree to anything short would effectively normalize Iran’s terrorism and illicit weapons programs. Both Israel and the Palestinian Authority game the State Department and European Union’s tendency to pursue diplomacy for its own sake.
