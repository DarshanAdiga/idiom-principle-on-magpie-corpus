Even today, when asked to explain their support for Trump, voters often point to his success in business as evidence of his acumen. And they often repeat his talking point that he gave up a great deal to serve as president, citing his sacrifice as evidence that he ran for the job not out of self-interest, but because he cares about improving the lives of people like them.

India is the world's largest producer of milk. It is a notable global player in milk production, contributing 22 per cent of the total. Regardless of COVID-19 outbreak, the milk production in India increased by six per cent in 2020. Having said that, let us discuss a new growing trend in India - Veganism.What is Veganism?Veganism is the practice of eliminating the use of animal products, particularly from the diet. A person who practices this philosophy is known as a Vegan. However, most people confuse Vegan to the Vegetarian way of eating. A Vegan would abstain from eating dairy products, eggs, meat, etc, but a Vegetarian may consume dairy products, including milk, curd, ghee and butter. This dietary and lifestyle choice aims to control and prevent 'cruelty' inflicted on animals.India's shift towards VeganismIndia has long been touted as the vegetarian capital of the world. And now, like the rest of the world, it is waking to the physical, ethical and economic benefits of plant-based, meat-and-dairy-free food. For several decades, India has been the dairy-loving country. Milk is an important and irreplaceable component of almost all Indian households. But the picture is changing now and veganism is increasingly being embraced.Social media has a profound impact on all the social and political issues. How can Veganism go untouched? Social Media has played an undeniable role in portraying 'cruelty' inflicted on animals in the dairy and meat industries. This has been one of the strong reasons behind the quick uptake of the vegan cause.Several celebrities admitted giving up on dairy products. Vegan influencers began to see the light of the day and garnered huge engagement on social media platforms. Thus, giving rise to an all new campaign and drifting the internet-savvy young generation to this new ethical and sustainable lifestyle. The overall impact of this was an adequate increase in number of Vegans in India.To meet the growing demands, several restaurants and food companies introduced robust vegan-friendly eatables. Websites popped up offering a wide range of vegan products. Although major part of a typical Indian diet is plant-based, the odds that had to be substituted were ghee, butter, cheese, curd etc.It is needless to say that this theory of lifestyle is not just behavioural, but also sustainable. Moreover, studies have shown that a well-balanced vegan diet can effortlessly provide all the nutrients.

Aberdeen Transportation Director Rich Krokel said both projects are considered safety improvements and they're the last to be done at the airport for the time being. The end goal is to have runway approaches at a 90-degree angle. To accomplish this some approaches have been eliminated over time and others have or will be been added.


  While there haven't been any incidents in connection to the approaches that aren't 90 degrees, Krokel said Federal Aviation Administration regulations require they be eliminated. By setting them at 90 degrees, he said, a pilot doesn't have to turn his or her entire body to look down the runway.


  That was also the reason behind the runway decoupling project in 2017, which removed asphalt surface from the north end of the north-south runway (17-35) where it connected to the airport's primary northwest-southeast runway (13-31). That work also added surface on the south end of both the runway and Taxiway C, which runs parallel to Runway 17-35.


  The work set for spring aims to remove existing concrete at the end of Runway 13-31 and pour new concrete establishing right-angle turns from Taxiway D, which runs parallel. It will also reconfigure taxiway connections from Taxiway C to Runway 13-31. One of the taxiway connections between Taxiway D and Runway 13-31 will be removed and replaced.


  This project will be completed by Sharpe Enterprises of Fort Pierre. The Aberdeen County Council approved a $2.9 million bid for it earlier this month. Including engineering fees, the job will cost about $3.5 million.

New Delhi Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said she is not being "risk averse" in her response to coping with the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and the 68-day lockdown imposed to slow its spread, which saw India's economy come to a near-complete halt for part of the first quarter of 2020-21.She added that she has no option but to increase government spending. "After all, among the four engines that support the economy, three have come to a complete standstill. It is public expenditure which has to do the heavy lifting." The government's borrowing calendar that has already been announced indicates as much, Sitharaman said. The government has already raised its gross market borrowing target for the year to ₹12 lakh crore from the ₹7.8 lakh crore announced in the Union Budget in February. Debt market analysts expect a further increase in this to ₹13 lakh crore.The government's relief package announced in May has been criticised for not having an adequate direct fiscal stimulus component and not doing enough to spur demand, but in an interview to HT, the finance minister said that she believes it does enough for both supply and demand. Still, she admitted, she has been receiving feedback from industry on the need for one more stimulus. "One more may be needed is what we are hearing from the people who interact with us, and we are trying to see what it is that we can do." Sitharaman said, like she has several times in the past, that she is open to providing more support but declined to get into details of when this might be forthcoming. "There's no point in me hurriedly getting something out."She also refused to get into a guessing game on this year's GDP. Sitharaman said that while the decline in GDP in the first quarter of 2020-21, at 23.9%, has been substantial, she does not want to conclude anything about the entire year's number just yet. She added that she expects the second and third quarter of the financial year to be better.Most analysts expect the country's GDP to shrink by at least 5% and as much as 10% in 2020-21. But things are getting better, the minister insisted, referring to conversations she has been having, with some industry representatives who are telling her that their sectors have reached pre- pandemic levels of production. Numbers bear out some of that. The latest value of the Nomura India Business Resumption Index was 82.3 on September 20, where 100 is the pre-pandemic level of business. The index has been steadily inching upward. "The revival is also happening in many labour intensive areas. This is also corroborated by the fact that migrant workers from many states have started going back (to their places of work)," Sitharaman said.HT reported on Monday that demand for jobs under the schemes has dipped, and surmised that this could be because some migrant workers have returned to their places of work in the cities. The minister singled out the agricultural sector (which grew 3.4% in the first quarter) as a symbol of resilience and talked up the farm reform laws passed by the government last week, even as she criticised the Opposition, and especially the Congress party, for opposing them. Responding to a question on the future of the economy, she said she is " hopeful -- that the coronavirus will recede, and the Indian entrepreneur, small big, medium, will succeed" but added that Ladakh, where the Indian and Chinese armies are in a face-off following transgressions by the latter " is one imponderable".

It’s hard to imagine a worse time to discuss increasing taxes on alcohol in Maryland.


  Restaurants, bars and craft producers throughout the state are struggling and full recovery is a long way off. It will take even longer for these businesses to rebound if they are hit with a tax increase just as they begin to regain their footing.


  I speak on behalf of Maryland’s alcohol producers — the hundreds of distillers, brewers and winemakers — who have shuttered their doors for months on end. We are working tirelessly to adapt and change business models based on state regulations in light of COVID-19, and still had to lay off large percentages of employees. My distillery, along with a vast majority of distilleries in Maryland, switched operations overnight to manufacture hand sanitizer for our first responders, partially with the generous donations of wine and beer from our fellow alcohol producers.


  In many ways, we have proven we are here for the community — and while we support the use of state dollars to address health care disparities, we respectfully request that we not be the industry to shoulder this burden. The last time Maryland raised taxes on alcohol, the result was a 4% decline in alcohol sales statewide. As we strive to rebuild our businesses, the last thing we need is a deterrent to consumer spending.


  The General Assembly should focus on ways to continue supporting the hospitality industry — as our distilleries, breweries, wineries, restaurants and bars work to rebuild and rehire employees — not cause further damage to an already decimated industry through increased taxes. While partial reopenings, outdoor dining and carry out orders have helped, the revenue produced from these sales pale in comparison to pre-pandemic levels. As it stands, the Restaurant Association of Maryland predicts up to 40% of Maryland restaurants may close permanently because of the pandemic.


  To be clear, alcohol is already taxed twice in Maryland, at the production level (excise tax) and at the point of sale — at a rate of 9% — that is 50% higher than the 6% rate applied to other retail items, but also significantly higher than that of neighboring states.


  Furthermore, the Craft Beverage Modernization and Tax Reform Act, which makes permanent a federal excise tax reduction enacted in 2017, is set to expire this December unless Congress acts fast.


  Small distillers, brewers and winemakers across state have used the tax savings to make significant investments in their businesses, hire new workers and support their local communities.

In Markkanen's first two years, he showed great promise as a skilled 7-foot forward who could score at all three levels, displayed sneaky athleticism as well as the ability to put the ball on the floor and create for himself a bit. He averaged 18.7 points and nine rebounds in his sophomore campaign. However, in Year 3, he significantly regressed. He wasn't being used in the ways that made him special in his second season, and it created frustration for the Finnish big man to the point where in April he reportedly told the franchise that he would like to be traded if changes weren't made.
 Chicago clearly got the message, because it began to clean house. As I wrote a few months back, Markkanen is a more dangerous player when he's given more freedom on offense. In his second season he cut to the basket more, led the charge in transition and was allowed to put the ball on the floor and pull up from mid-range at a higher rate than what Jim Boylen and the Bulls had him doing this season. As a result, he was far more difficult to guard because he could score in a variety of ways.
 With a new regime in Chicago now, Markkanen's skills should be on full display once again.

SPACs go public as cash shells, with sponsors charged with identifying a merger target and negotiating a transaction. Once the companies combine, the SPAC ceases to exist and the operating company goes public in the process. This has been a record-breaking year for SPACs in general, which have completed more initial public offerings and raised more money than ever. Private companies have cited the certainty of proceeds and faster time to market as a selling point of SPACs relative to the traditional IPO process.
 Tortoise will provide additional details about its shareholder vote in a later regulatory filing. In addition to giving the proposed merger a thumbs up or thumbs down, shareholders also have the option to redeem their stock for a proportionate share of the cash in the SPAC’s trust. That is about $10 in Tortoise’s case—not a compelling value for a stock trading at close to $50.

I waited with Senior Reporter, Greg Jordan and discussed my fear of needles. He knew I was nervous and let me go first (thanks Greg!) and I walked in the door, medical card in hand.


  I walked in, filled out some paperwork and sat down in a chair. When she asked which arm, I asked her which was better before saying, “forget it, just do it, please.” As I took my sweater off, the tattoo on the back of my arm became visible. The nurses began to giggle with me at my irrational fear of a quick prick in the arm for my own safety and others when I have endured hundreds of needles piercing my skin for hours at a time to get my body art. In my opinion, tattoos involve so many needles that it just turns into pain, you can’t necessarily feel each individual poke.


  I focused at the movement of the trees in the wind as she injected my flu vaccine in my right arm, breathing deeply and before I knew it, it was over. I had to sit for a few minutes to make sure I wouldn’t pass out, but I think I may have aged out of my fear, to a certain extent.


  I have spent years fearing the flu shot or any blood work and obviously, being irresponsible with my own health by avoiding the flu shot. I feel this could be a metaphor for a lot of things that we avoid in life out of fear. Oftentimes, it will be over before you can blink away from the movement of the trees.

Gabe DiSaverio calls himself a "Jaws nut."
 He's into anyone, or anything that has any connection to the 1975 killer-shark blockbuster movie "Jaws." The obsession has infiltrated all facets of his life.
 DiSaverio's vacations have been Jaws themed, his business and conservation efforts revolve around sharks, and his daughter's middle name is Ellen, after Jaws character Police Chief Martin Brody's wife.
 "I'm pretty sure I can scientifically prove it's the greatest movie ever made," he said.
 Part of his Jaws fandom includes a 15-year search for a 1975 Chevy Blazer, like the one Chief Brody drove in the movie. While business lagged during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Portsmouth resident scoured the internet, saw one up for auction, maybe in his price range, so he asked his wife, Jill Fratianne, what she thought.
 "She said, 'You work eight days a week, you've never bought a toy for yourself and you've been talking about this since our third date,'" he recalled.
 It was the green light he needed and during a live auction for the K5 Cheyenne, he was the highest bidder. When he won, DiSaverio said, "I was literally shaking."
 Owner of The Spicy Shark hot sauce company, DiSaverio said when he first saw the movie Jaws he was 8-years-old and, "I was just captivated."
 When he moved to Boston in 1997, his favorite vacation spot became Martha's Vineyard, the setting for the movie's fictitious Amity Island. He said he was a regular on "Jaws tours," took photos from every location in the movie and, "I may have even re-enacted some of my favorite scenes when no one was looking."
 He describes his first JawsFest on the Vineyard in 2012 as, "a life-changing event," where he met some of the film's living actors and others involved in the filmmaking. He met Wendy Benchley, widow of Jaws author Peter Benchley, which led to his involvement in shark conservation. It's a passion he supports by donating a portion of the proceeds from his hot sauces for advocacy to end the shark fin trade.
 When DiSaverio brought his Spicy Shark hot sauces to market at "Shark-Con" in Florida last year, he said, "I was in heaven."
 "I spent more money than I made and loved every minute," he said.
 Highlights there included meeting Alex Kitner, who played a boy on a raft in the movie Jaws and Chrissy Watkins, a girl in the opening scene.
 All the while, DiSaverio obsessed about a 1975 Blazer. He said he checked the internet every few months to see if one was for sale "anywhere in the country." In July, during the 45th anniversary of Jaws, he bought his vintage Blazer from a North Carolina owner.
 Unable to afford the cost of having it shipped to him, he flew south to "get my new baby" and drove it back to Portsmouth. He calls the Blazer "Martin," Chief Brody's first name.
 "But you can call him Marty," he said.
 DiSaverio found three other people to help him remove the hard top. The roll bar was painted black and back panel painted white at Ben's Auto Body, to match the movie rig.
 Replica hubcaps were found online and he added non-working cherry lights on the roll bar. The cherry lights, he said, were "absolutely critical."
 He ordered vanity "AMITY" license plates and, on Thursday, had custom "Amity Police Dept" stickers, from Hampton's Sticker Cabana, adhered to the doors.
 "There are two or three others (replica Jaws Blazers) out there, but they don't have the right lettering," he said. "You gotta have the exact font."
 While driving through the center of Portsmouth last week, two beat officers turned their heads as he went past, one shouting, "Jaws!"
 "I get a lot of honks and fists in the air," he said. "Everyone who turns their head has a big smile on their face."
 DiSaverio said the Blazer will be his summer ride, to bring smiles to faces, then stored during New Hampshire winters. It will also be his "company car," with his Spicy Shark brand on the back, to promote his hot sauces he rates by one to six shark fins to indicate heat.
 He also considers the Jaws replica Blazer a part of his family.
 "I have a daughter," he said. "This is my son."

“We’re pleased that justice has been done and we’re glad to have been vindicated,” Assistant U.S. Attorney John Davis said after the verdict.


  Davis said he hoped there would be a “deterrent value” in the conviction that might resonate among “everyone on the internet and the white nationalist world and other worlds where really abhorrent things are said.”


  “You do have a right to free speech and there is a First Amendment,” he said. “But when you violate the regulate norms that apply — you can’t threaten someone as part of an extortion attempt — it isn’t going to matter even if it is in the white nationalist internet world.”


  Cantwell, dressed in a shirt and tie and wearing a mask, did not appear to show any visible reaction to the verdict. His defense team declined to comment.


  Authorities say Cantwell used the Telegram messaging app to convey a threat last year that he would rape the man’s wife if he didn’t give up information about the leader of a white supremacist group of which the man was a member, authorities said. The Associated Press is not naming the man to protect the identify of his wife.


  Cantwell is also accused of threatening to expose the man’s identity and warning “you will lose everything you have” if he didn’t provide the personal details about the leader of the Bowl Patrol. The group’s name was inspired by the haircut of Dylann Roof, who was sentenced to death for fatally shooting nine Black church members during a Bible study session in Charleston, South Carolina.


  Cantwell followed through on another threat to report the Missouri man, who has several children, to the state’s child division for drug use and racist views. But an agency official testified at the trial that it did not feel the complaint justified further investigation.


  Cantwell’s attorney, Eric Wolpin, on Friday acknowledged in his closing remarks that his client’s language was “obscene” and “over the top.” But he said it never rose to the level of an actual threat, nor was it tied to anything of value.

The exact cost has not been tallied, but the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that the sick leave and family leave provisions alone would cost $105 billion.
 Lawmakers are simultaneously trying to craft another emergency package that could cost $1.3 trillion — far more than the mammoth recession-fighting packages that Congress passed in 2008 and 2009 during the financial crisis.
 That package could include two rounds of direct payments to Americans, totaling $250 billion each, according to a Treasury Department proposal seen by Reuters.
 Trump suggested on Tuesday those checks could amount to up to $1,000 each. Payments would be tiered based on income and family size. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said expanded unemployment benefits would provide more of an impact.
 The plan also would provide $300 billion for small businesses, $50 billion in loans for cash-strapped airlines and $150 billion for loan guarantees to other distressed economic sectors.
 Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said his party hoped to forge a deal with the White House soon. Another Republican, Sen. Richard Shelby, said it could be unveiled as soon as Wednesday evening.
 Mindful of lingering voter anger over the 2008 bank bailout, lawmakers said any industry-specific aid should come in the form of loans that must be paid back.
 “I’m not in favor of just handing over billions in taxpayer dollars to the airlines or others,” Republican Sen. Josh Hawley told reporters.
 Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin privately warned this week that unemployment could hit 20% if Congress does not act.
 Separately, the Trump administration also asked Congress for an additional $45.8 billion to shore up U.S. government agencies responding to the outbreak.
 It would also give extra funds to improve airport sanitation, provide protective gear to federal agents, bolster cybersecurity protections, improve teleworking capabilities and shore up the Amtrak passenger rail service, which has seen a steep drop in ridership.
 House Democrats had concerns that the bill might also enable the Homeland Security Department to deport more immigrants who are in the country illegally, according to an aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
 Early this month, Congress approved a first $8.3 billion package to boost the medical response to the pandemic.
 Health officials have advised Americans to avoid non-essential travel and large gatherings in an effort to stop the spread of the coronavirus.
 In a step aimed at limiting the spread of the virus among the lawmakers themselves, McConnell said he planned to double the amount of time to vote to limit the number of members in the chamber at any one time.
 On Wednesday, he warned his fellow senators not to linger during votes, as they normally do.
 “Come in and vote and leave,” McConnell said.

For the Democrats, court-packing would be a murder-suicide. It would end the Supreme Court as we know it, and almost certainly bring a swift and decisive end to Democratic congressional majorities. There’s a reason Republicans aren’t taking the threat seriously in their calculations — it’s doubtful Democrats would seriously try to go down this route, and if they did, every expectation is that they would fail.


  No matter how outraged a party is, the rules of political gravity still apply. A president is at the high point of his power at the outset, steadily losing juice until a nearly inevitable midterm rebuke substantially reduces his or her sway.


  Would Biden be so determined to pack the court that he would spend precious capital early in his presidency on it? If so, voting, green energy and health care legislation would take a back seat, and depending on the severity of the backlash, perhaps not happen at all.


  If, instead, all that legislation went first, court-packing would be pushed toward the back of the line, when Biden would have less political power than when he started. This would make court-packing, a gargantuan task in the best of circumstances, even harder.


  The question of timing would enter in another way. Let’s say there’s a bruising battle over court-packing that Democrats win sometime in the second year of a Biden presidency. How much time and political capital would they then have to fill the seats? Enough to fill all of them before the midterms? If not, they certainly wouldn’t get filled if Republicans took back the Senate, a scenario that’s easy to imagine.


  And, of course, when Republicans hold the presidency and Congress again, they’d add their own seats or subtract the Democratic ones, making the entire exercise a nullity except for the permanent diminishment of the standing of the court.


  It’s also true that, as a general rule, big changes happen in our system when a party makes a sustained public case for them prior to an election. Very few elected Democrats are even willing to come out in favor of packing the court, trying to make it a central issue in the campaign. Biden the other day pointedly refused to endorse it.

Mumbai More coronavirus disease (Covid-19) locks look set to be removed with restaurants across Maharashtra likely to reopen in the first week of October, although with a host of safeguards. The government is also considering resuming suburban train services for all by the middle of next month. The developments, ironically, happened on a day when Mumbai crossed the 200,000 Covid-19 cases mark, with the addition of 2,055 infections taking the count to 200,901.The state government on Monday assured hoteliers of granting requisite permissions, during a meeting with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. A standard operation procedure (SOP) is expected to be finalised in the next few days. Valsa R Nair Singh, principal secretary, tourism department, said they have been allowed to reopen restaurants from the first week of October. "The SOP is yet to be finalised," she said.Mumbai suburban guardian minister Aaditya Thackeray on Monday told HT the state government was looking at resuming suburban train services by mid-October, a demand made by commuters for a while. Thackeray also said the government was talking to associations of the business community to stagger office timings to ease congestion in public transport and was thinking about allowing 24x7 offices in commercial establishments.All this comes after September witnessed a dramatic surge in the number of Covid-19 cases in the city, with 2,000-2,300 cases being reported daily through the month, against the earlier 1,200 to 1,500 cases.The state, meanwhile, reported 11,921 cases on Monday, taking the count to 1,351,153, and 180 deaths, pushing the toll to 35,751.There were 26,784 active cases in Mumbai, as of Monday. According to figures up till Sunday, September saw a 105% increase in Covid-19 cases, from the corresponding period in August, and a 98% increase in comparison to the same number of days in May. A total of 51,899 Covid-19 cases have been reported in the city between September 1 and September 27.Civic health officials said that the high daily caseload would continue in the coming days, owing to the upcoming season of festivals.Experts believe the number of Covid-19 cases will drastically drop by December or January, especially if Mumbai continues to increase its testing capacity, and timely isolate more patients and high-risk contacts.Until Saturday, Mumbai had conducted 10.82 lakh Covid-19 tests, at a positivity rate of 18.15%.Positivity rate is calculated as the per cent of people who have tested positive in comparison to the total number of tests done. Mumbai has been conducting up to 15,000 tests a day. This figure is lower on some days and ranges between 9,000 and 13,000 tests. Dr Rahul Pandit, director-critical care, Fortis Hospital, Mulund, said, "There is no one reason why September has been the worst month. But the more we test now, and if we continue with this aggressive testing even in October, then come December and January, the numbers will drop, because we will be able to isolate patients and curb the spread."Civic health officials and experts have also attributed the increase in the number of cases in September to reverse migration, as labourers are now returning to the city for work; to 'herd' testing, which means as businesses, shops, offices, or eateries are opening up, employers and owners are opting to get their employees tested periodically before returning to work; increased interaction of the unorganised workforce such as house helps, drivers, street vendors, or hawkers, with the community, and instances of local transmission arising from such interaction, as well as from the festival season. The increase in cases has also been attributed to scaled-up testing in Mumbai.According to experts, the surge is also partly due to lack of Covid-19 etiquette among Mumbaiites; failure to maintain social distancing, to wear masks, to wash hands frequently, to avoid crowds or poorly ventilated spaces; and an overall complacency about taking precautions.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner in-charge of the public health department in the civic body, said last week, "With unlock plans and the city opening up, this trend is expected. We are testing more. But this is not only attributed to increase in testing, but also to increased interaction in the community in general, such as house helps returning to work, people beginning to buy groceries and vegetables on a daily basis, as opposed to the behaviour in March and April."Kiran Dighavkar, assistant commissioner of the G/North ward, comprising areas of Dadar, Shivaji Park, Mahim and Dharavi, said. "A trend is very evident where employers of businesses want to test their employees before they return to work. So at a time, one business, or shop, or organisation gets anywhere between 10 to 50 people tested. Moreover, as house helps and drivers are returning to work, their employers, too, test them regularly."Dr Shashank Joshi, who is a member of Maharashtra government's Covid-19 task force, said, "This trend was expected, as transport opens up, and people commute within the city and to satellite cities. With unlocking plans, interaction is going to increase."Dr Pandit said, "Just at the onset of September, we had one festival, that gave scope for more interaction and for people to meet each other, venture out for shopping. Around the same time, BMC increased their testing capacity, and now they are testing almost 15,000 daily. In a way, they cast a wider net to catch more cases, and that is a good thing."However, experts have pointed out that the way forward is for Mumbaiites to show greater responsibility. Pointing out that for every tested person, there are 20 people who are also positive, but who have not tested and who do not have symptoms, Dr Joshi said, "In terms of lack of cooperation from citizens, the month of September has been very disappointing. Mumbaiiites have not shown any discipline in terms of maintaining social distancing, wearing masks, avoiding crowds and avoiding poorly ventilated spaces and Covid hygiene. Mumbaiites need to wake up and observer stricter discipline."As Mumbaiites are allowed to venture out for work, shopping is allowed, visiting public places such as beaches or promenades is allowed, a sense of normalcy is settling in. According to Dr Pandit, this lack of discipline is also attributed to some amount of complacency setting in due to unlock plans. "The pandemic has reached a stage where it is no longer the government, which is responsible for absolutely everything. It is the people's responsibility that is more than that. We must observe appropriate behaviour and habits. Wear masks, maintain social distancing, plan travel so as to avoid crowds, test on time and isolate on time. On the contrary, in March, April and May, lockdown mandated stricter discipline."The civic body has until Saturday fined 14,207 citizens for not wearing masks and collected ₹52.76 lakh from them. Of this, fines worth ₹19 lakh were collected from 9,218 defaulters between September 13 and 26 alone."If you do not maintain social distancing, and do not wear masks, the chances of your proximity to an asymptomatic carrier are going to increase. Social distancing works, we have seen that, even in other countries. This is the only thing that can be applied in the long term", said Dr Om Shrivastav, who is a city-based consultant for infectious diseases. As per BMC's Covid war room data, 68% of detected Covid patients are asymptomatic, 27% are symptomatic and 5% are critical.Experts also believeD that the government needs to further scale up Mumbai's testing capacity to at least double the number of daily tests being done at present. While Dr Joshi said, considering Mumbai's population, the city needs to conduct at least 30,000 to 50,000 tests a day. Dr Om Shrivastav said, "Mumbai should be doing over 1.5 lakh tests per day."According to Dr Pandit, it is also important to stick to the basics from the administrative point of view, testing in high number, isolating positive patients, contact tracing, and quarantining high risk contacts.Dr Joshi said, "We are aiming to bring down case fatality rate (CFR) to less than 1%, going forward. In many parts of Maharashtra we have been successful in doing so." In Mumbai too, CFR has dropped from 5.7% to 4.5%. HT reported on September 21 that in the past 31 days, the city has recorded CFR of 2.2% (1,115 deaths and 51,617 cases), which has helped bring down Mumbai's overall CFR."

Amazon.com Inc. expects to nearly triple its workforce in Vancouver, where software engineers are cheap, smart and plentiful.


  The online retail giant plans to occupy a bunkerlike former Canada Post mailing center that's being redeveloped into a new 1.1 million square-foot office to house 8,000 jobs by 2023, Jesse Dougherty, a vice president and Vancouver site lead at Amazon, said by phone. Currently, the company has 2,700 full-time employees at its city hub. It also plans to add 500 jobs in Toronto, according to a statement released Monday.


  A weak loonie, lower wages and a steady flow of graduates make Canada an attractive place to expand for tech companies whose largest expense is labor.


  The average wage of a software developer in Vancouver last year was $92,726, compared to $141,785 in San Francisco or $128,067 in Amazon's hometown of Seattle, according to a July report by real estate firm CBRE Group Inc. Once rental costs are folded in, the cost of running a 500-employee operation in the Canadian city is half that of a similar-sized operation in the Bay Area, it found.


  Vancouver also had the fastest-growing tech labor pool of 50 markets surveyed in the U.S. and Canada by CBRE, while the quality of its talent based on academic degrees and work experience ranked among the top 10, the study found.


  The expansion positions the company to become one of the city's biggest employers: Vancouver-based telecommunications giant Telus Corp. has about 8,000 staff in the province, according to Business In Vancouver.

“Mike Redding, in the first half, makes a tightly contested catch on one-to- one man coverage on a third-and-5,” Hurricanes coach Manny Diaz said.


  Defensively, Diaz was pleased to allow so many youngsters see in-game snaps. The group was tested on the final defensive series as the Seminoles got down to UM’s 1-yard line. Quentin Williams was in on a tackle for loss and Austin- Cave had a big hit for no gain before a sack by redshirt sophomore former walk-on Ryan Ragone on fourth down ended the possession.


  “It was great to get some guys in there,” Diaz said. "Chantz Williams being able to get in there. Obviously, we got Elijah Roberts in there. Quentin Williams made a play down there in the red zone. Isaiah Dunson and Brian Balom got a lot of reps, which is really important for them. Jalen Harrell had a nice tackle.


  “I think we had 30 guys that had a tackle or an assist in the game, which I don’t think I’ve ever heard of before. That’s quite a remarkable stat.”


  Diaz also noted Rivers' play on the offensive line. Rivers, although listed as second-team right guard on the depth chart, first got in at right tackle with redshirt junior Cleveland Reed subbing in at guard. Rivers then went to the left side at tackle, allowing Washington to come in at right tackle.


  Diaz has been touting the freshman class' work ethic since the players signed as recruits. It’s coming to fruition early on.


  “This class has something to it,” said Diaz, adding the freshmen are doing 5:45 a.m. developmental lifting sessions with strength and conditioning coach David Feeley. "You can just really tell how they are when they work when no one’s watching. You can see the talent on the field, but who you are gets tested in that weight room every week.

Both candidates are likely to repeat their talking points about the Supreme Court. But during the debate, their comments are likely to reach vast swaths of the electorate that haven’t been following the campaign closely. Biden has said Ginsburg’s seat should remain vacant until after the election, while Trump has nominated Amy Coney Barrett and the Republican-controlled Senate is rushing to confirm her.


  Biden promises to name a Black woman to the court if he gets the chance, but has resisted Trump’s call for him to release a list of possible Supreme Court nominees, as Trump did this year and in 2016. Biden also won’t commit to expanding the court, as some leading progressives are advocating, arguing that to do either would be playing politics by Trump’s rules.


  He’s instead using the vacancy to focus on how the court fight could threaten the Obama administration’s signature health care law amid a pandemic — a case he’ll make again during the debate.


  “It doesn’t matter to them that millions of Americans are already voting on a new president and a new Congress,” Biden said of the Trump administration during a speech Sunday in Wilmington, Delaware. “They see an opportunity to overturn the Affordable Care Act on their way out the door.”


  Trump, for his part, is likely to brag about the two justices he’s already put on the Supreme Court and look to energize his base with the prospect of a third, which would give conservatives a 6-3 advantage on the court.


  “Most important of all, she will defend your God-given rights and freedoms,” Trump said of Barrett during a weekend rally in Pennsylvania, where the crowd chanted, “Fill that seat!”


  Brett O’Donnell, who has helped five Republican presidential candidates prepare for debates and was formerly the debate coach at Liberty University, said he expects Trump to say “a lot of what he’s already been saying about the courts on the stump.”


  “If you watch his debate performances, much of what happens in the debates gets tested out in his town halls,” he said.

A portion of this year’s shoreline repair work along Old Lakeshore Road in Bright's Grove has been postponed, partly due to unusually ice-free waters last winter.
 "Usually on the shore of Lake Huron, we get hundreds of feet of ice and the ice is a solid platform on which the machines can work," said Sarnia construction manager Rob Williams about the preferred conditions for shoreline repair work.
 "Last winter was probably one of the few winters we've ever had where we had almost no ice."
 That also meant little protection for workers from north winds off the lake, he said, while slowing progress on three projects to build armour stone retaining walls along about 665 metres.
 Shoreline work is generally halted during fish-spawning season from March 15 to July 15. For work to continue in the summer and fall, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada and the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry required platforms be built for machine work to continue with the $4.7-million in shoreline protection work, Williams said. Roughly 40 per cent of the costs are being covered by a federal Disaster Mitigation and Adaptation Fund grant, he added.
 Negotiations for how much the city would pay for the platforms were worked out with two of three contractors, but not the third, he said.
 Both sides agreed the contract with Amico Corporation for the largest - about $2.2 million - of the three contracts should be terminated, and the work retendered for 2021, Williams said.
 "A price couldn't be agreed upon, and they felt that they couldn't warranty the work," he said.
 The city has only paid for the roughly 20 per cent of the work that was completed.
 The balance of the work will be moved to the list of proposed projects for 2020, he said, along with at least another $2 million in shoreline protection work.
 Last year's budget planning process pencilled in about $2 million per year for 10 years to help cut into the estimated $30-million backlog of shoreline protection work. The shoreline has been eroding into the lake amid historically high water levels and largely steel-wall infrastructure built decades ago that has been failing.
 Emergency repairs were ordered for failures in April, including a sinkhole between Pine Avenue and Penhuron Drive.
 Expect that to be one of the areas proposed to council for funding for a more permanent fix in 2021, Williams said.
 "It was a rock revetment that was done in the early '80s and it's showing some weaknesses."

Lightfoot, a Democrat who’s endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden against Trump, said she’s “deeply disturbed” by the reporting’s findings, which suggest Trump used “every trick in the book” to avoid paying his fair share.


  “It doesn’t seem right, it doesn’t seem fair, and it explains a lot,” Lightfoot said. “It explains why he’s gone to great lengths to avoid allowing us as members of the public to take our measure of whether or not he’s living up to his responsibilities and his fair share.”

Not long after the Stanley Cup is awarded, which could be as soon as Monday night if the Lightning beat the Dallas Stars in Game 6 of the final, the two sides will talk about when next season might start, how many games might be possible, what testing and protocols might be required and whether fans might be allowed into buildings at some capacity at some point.


  A week after Commissioner Gary Bettman said a mid-to-late December or January start was possible, Fehr agreed that the tentative Dec. 1 opening night target date was the “earliest conceivable date” the season could start and there’s good reason to believe it’ll be later.


  The NHLPA is in the process of finalizing a committee to start answering the myriad of questions hockey faces in trying to get another season going. And while that and negotiations will begin quickly, the league and players are on the same page, that just like the return to play plan, they want to take time to get this right.


  “Nobody is going to rush it,” Fehr said.


  It helps the NHL has some time and an opportunity to monitor the NFL, Major League Baseball and college athletics for what’s working and not working in those sports.


  But the NHL is the most dependent on attendance, which Bettman said affects at least 50% of revenues. It needs fans, but might not be able to get them in all 31 buildings.


  “On whatever basis we may or may not be able to have fans in our buildings is something that may be well beyond our control in terms of local government regulations that will determine how much the shortfall is off of where we were and off of where we were projecting,” Bettman said Sept. 19.


  The league and players negotiated a long-term extension of the collective bargaining agreement knowing projections for at least next season would be much different given the global pandemic. If each team can’t play 82 games with some fans at some point, everyone is likely to take an even bigger financial hit than expected, which could affect player salaries.

“The last time I shot a movie in Detroit with a great script and a great cast things worked out really well, so I’m very excited behind my mask right now,” Soderbergh said in a press release, referencing 1998’s _Out of Sight_. _No Sudden Move_ was previously titled _Kill Switch_ before it was put on hold in March due to the coronavirus. Sebastian Stan, George Clooney, and John Cena were all connected to the film at one point. In April, Soderbergh was appointed head of the Director’s Guild of America’s coronavirus task force, so considering he’s heading back to production, we must once again ask: What does Soderbergh ___know_? _No Sudden Move_ is one of the first films to be part of his overall deal with the infant streamer. Another, _Let Them All Talk_, starring Meryl Streep, Dianne Wiest, Lucas Hedges, and Gemma Chan, is expected on HBO Max sometime this year. Clearly the stans had a say in that, too.

More coronavirus disease (Covid-19) locks look set to be removed with restaurants across Maharashtra likely to reopen in the first week of October, although with a host of safeguards. The government is also considering resuming suburban train services for all by the middle of next month. The developments, ironically, happened on a day when Mumbai crossed the 200,000 Covid-19 cases mark, with the addition of 2,055 infections taking the count to 200,901.


  The state government on Monday assured hoteliers of granting requisite permissions, during a meeting with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. A standard operation procedure (SOP) is expected to be finalised in the next few days. Valsa R Nair Singh, principal secretary, tourism department, said they have been allowed to reopen restaurants from the first week of October. "The SOP is yet to be finalised," she said.


  Mumbai suburban guardian minister Aaditya Thackeray on Monday told HT the state government was looking at resuming suburban train services by mid- October, a demand made by commuters for a while. Thackeray also said the government was talking to associations of the business community to stagger office timings to ease congestion in public transport and was thinking about allowing 24x7 offices in commercial establishments.


  All this comes after September witnessed a dramatic surge in the number of Covid-19 cases in the city, with 2,000-2,300 cases being reported daily through the month, against the earlier 1,200 to 1,500 cases.


  The state, meanwhile, reported 11,921 cases on Monday, taking the count to 1,351,153, and 180 deaths, pushing the toll to 35,751.


  There were 26,784 active cases in Mumbai, as of Monday. According to figures up till Sunday, September saw a 105% increase in Covid-19 cases, from the corresponding period in August, and a 98% increase in comparison to the same number of days in May. A total of 51,899 Covid-19 cases have been reported in the city between September 1 and September 27.


  Civic health officials said that the high daily caseload would continue in the coming days, owing to the upcoming season of festivals.


  Experts believe the number of Covid-19 cases will drastically drop by December or January, especially if Mumbai continues to increase its testing capacity, and timely isolate more patients and high-risk contacts.


  Until Saturday, Mumbai had conducted 10.82 lakh Covid-19 tests, at a positivity rate of 18.15%.


  Positivity rate is calculated as the per cent of people who have tested positive in comparison to the total number of tests done. Mumbai has been conducting up to 15,000 tests a day. This figure is lower on some days and ranges between 9,000 and 13,000 tests. Dr Rahul Pandit, director-critical care, Fortis Hospital, Mulund, said, "There is no one reason why September has been the worst month. But the more we test now, and if we continue with this aggressive testing even in October, then come December and January, the numbers will drop, because we will be able to isolate patients and curb the spread."


  Civic health officials and experts have also attributed the increase in the number of cases in September to reverse migration, as labourers are now returning to the city for work; to 'herd' testing, which means as businesses, shops, offices, or eateries are opening up, employers and owners are opting to get their employees tested periodically before returning to work; increased interaction of the unorganised workforce such as house helps, drivers, street vendors, or hawkers, with the community, and instances of local transmission arising from such interaction, as well as from the festival season. The increase in cases has also been attributed to scaled-up testing in Mumbai.


  According to experts, the surge is also partly due to lack of Covid-19 etiquette among Mumbaiites; failure to maintain social distancing, to wear masks, to wash hands frequently, to avoid crowds or poorly ventilated spaces; and an overall complacency about taking precautions.


  Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner in-charge of the public health department in the civic body, said last week, "With unlock plans and the city opening up, this trend is expected. We are testing more. But this is not only attributed to increase in testing, but also to increased interaction in the community in general, such as house helps returning to work, people beginning to buy groceries and vegetables on a daily basis, as opposed to the behaviour in March and April."


  Kiran Dighavkar, assistant commissioner of the G/North ward, comprising areas of Dadar, Shivaji Park, Mahim and Dharavi, said. "A trend is very evident where employers of businesses want to test their employees before they return to work. So at a time, one business, or shop, or organisation gets anywhere between 10 to 50 people tested. Moreover, as house helps and drivers are returning to work, their employers, too, test them regularly."


  Dr Shashank Joshi, who is a member of Maharashtra government's Covid-19 task force, said, "This trend was expected, as transport opens up, and people commute within the city and to satellite cities. With unlocking plans, interaction is going to increase."


  Dr Pandit said, "Just at the onset of September, we had one festival, that gave scope for more interaction and for people to meet each other, venture out for shopping. Around the same time, BMC increased their testing capacity, and now they are testing almost 15,000 daily. In a way, they cast a wider net to catch more cases, and that is a good thing."


  However, experts have pointed out that the way forward is for Mumbaiites to show greater responsibility. Pointing out that for every tested person, there are 20 people who are also positive, but who have not tested and who do not have symptoms, Dr Joshi said, "In terms of lack of cooperation from citizens, the month of September has been very disappointing. Mumbaiiites have not shown any discipline in terms of maintaining social distancing, wearing masks, avoiding crowds and avoiding poorly ventilated spaces and Covid hygiene. Mumbaiites need to wake up and observer stricter discipline."


  As Mumbaiites are allowed to venture out for work, shopping is allowed, visiting public places such as beaches or promenades is allowed, a sense of normalcy is settling in. According to Dr Pandit, this lack of discipline is also attributed to some amount of complacency setting in due to unlock plans. "The pandemic has reached a stage where it is no longer the government, which is responsible for absolutely everything. It is the people's responsibility that is more than that. We must observe appropriate behaviour and habits. Wear masks, maintain social distancing, plan travel so as to avoid crowds, test on time and isolate on time. On the contrary, in March, April and May, lockdown mandated stricter discipline."


  The civic body has until Saturday fined 14,207 citizens for not wearing masks and collected ₹52.76 lakh from them. Of this, fines worth ₹19 lakh were collected from 9,218 defaulters between September 13 and 26 alone.


  "If you do not maintain social distancing, and do not wear masks, the chances of your proximity to an asymptomatic carrier are going to increase. Social distancing works, we have seen that, even in other countries. This is the only thing that can be applied in the long term", said Dr Om Shrivastav, who is a city-based consultant for infectious diseases. As per BMC's Covid war room data, 68% of detected Covid patients are asymptomatic, 27% are symptomatic and 5% are critical.


  Experts also believeD that the government needs to further scale up Mumbai's testing capacity to at least double the number of daily tests being done at present. While Dr Joshi said, considering Mumbai's population, the city needs to conduct at least 30,000 to 50,000 tests a day. Dr Om Shrivastav said, "Mumbai should be doing over 1.5 lakh tests per day."


  According to Dr Pandit, it is also important to stick to the basics from the administrative point of view, testing in high number, isolating positive patients, contact tracing, and quarantining high risk contacts.


  Dr Joshi said, "We are aiming to bring down case fatality rate (CFR) to less than 1%, going forward. In many parts of Maharashtra we have been successful in doing so." In Mumbai too, CFR has dropped from 5.7% to 4.5%. HT reported on September 21 that in the past 31 days, the city has recorded CFR of 2.2% (1,115 deaths and 51,617 cases), which has helped bring down Mumbai's overall CFR."

CARSON, Calif. (AP) — Cristian Roldan scored his first two goals of the season, Jordan Morris added a goal and an assist, and the Seattle Sounders beat the LA Galaxy 3-1 on Sunday night.
 Morris ran onto a long rolling ball on the left side by Nouhou Tolo, worked his way to the near post before slipping a pass to Roldan for the sliding finish from point-blank range to open the scoring in the 12th minute. It was the 25-year-old midfielder's first goal since scoring twice against LA on September 1, 2019.
 Seattle (7-3-3) has won three of its last four games.
 Morris outran Rolf Feltscher to get to a through ball by Nicolás Lodeiro and then tapped a side-footer in the 38th. Roldan slipped behind the defense and ran onto an arcing pass by João Paulo and lofted a chip shot over goalkeeper David Bingham near the top of the box into the net to make it 3-0 in the 61st minute.

In anticipation of a possible vaccine for Covid-19, the district health department will be conducting a thorough assessment of the available 'cold chain' infrastructure in the coming weeks, officials confirmed on Monday.


  The exercise will take stock of available cold chain equipment (CCE), such as walk-in freezers, walk-in coolers, ice-lined refrigerators and temperature- monitoring devices, which are used in the storage and transportation of vaccines. The assessment will also identify potential sites for bulk storage of vaccines, known as cold chain points (CCP).


  Dr Naresh Garg, district immunisation officer and nodal officer for cold chain management in Gurugram, said, "We have not received an official intimation about the same, but are aware that Central orders have been issued earlier this month. As soon as we get the order from the state National Health Mission, we shall begin the task."


  Prabjot Singh, mission director, NHM, Haryana, did not respond to requests for comment on Monday.


  A senior doctor working with the NHM's Universal Immunisation Program (UIP) in Haryana, seeking anonymity, confirmed that as per a central NHM order issued earlier this month, all states and union territories in India will be expected to create district-level plans for storage and delivery of Covid-19 vaccines within the next month. Task forces to oversee this preparation are expected to be constituted at the district- and block-levels.


  "The main challenge in the delivery of this vaccine will be the immunisation coverage. The target population for our routine immunisation drives is confined to infants, children and mothers. With Covid-19, we have to vaccinate the population at large, which has not been done before," the official said, adding that the vaccine would likely be administered in phases, beginning with health workers and high-risk groups.


  Health department officials in the district added that in addition to assessing the availability of cold chain infrastructure, they will also be making plans to train an adequate number of qualified technicians in cold chain management. "Retaining the integrity of the vaccine requires its storage at a certain temperature. Otherwise, it will lose its efficiency. We will need to identify and train qualified cold chain managers, cold chain handlers and cold chain technicians for this purpose," said Garg.


  Gurugram district, which currently has 39 existing CCPs for storage and delivery of vaccines, also serves as the regional storage point for immunisation programs in four other districts, namely Faridabad, Rewari, Palwal and Jhajjar.

The Premier League LIV vs ARS clash will kick- off at 12.30 AM IST - September 29 in India. Both teams are on winning streaks and the battle for the win will be intense over at Anfield. After dominating Arsenal for almost two years Liverpool lost two games on the trot against the Gunners this year.

The defending champions currently in 4th place on the table have won both their Premier League games so far. Some exceptional performances from Salah and Mane have put them in a good position and they will want to keep up their winning streak tonight. With the sides set to meet again at the Carabao Cup this week a win tonight would have great consequences on that game.

It didn’t take an excellent performance in a Champions Cup semi-final to tell us what we already knew. But if there was ever any doubt about Donnacha Ryan&rsquo;s enduring class, then the ageless Tipperary man rolled back the years to deliver another stark reminder of why he should never have been allowed to leave Munster – and Ireland.In the end, Ryan made the decision to move to France, yet that doesn&rsquo;t mean enough was done to stop his head being turned by Racing 92.The IRFU were firm in their stance that a 33-year-old lock didn&rsquo;t merit a lucrative central contract as Ryan&rsquo;s age was cited as the main reason.The whole situation was soured even further when the union had less of an issue handing out a contract to Jamie Heaslip, who is only four days younger than Ryan.Munster were not impressed, Ryan less so, but the same central contract was not a simple straightforward shoot-out between the veteran pair.Instead, Joe Schmidt put his faith in Devin Toner, who when it came down to it, was controversially axed by the Kiwi for last year&rsquo;s World Cup.The Ryan debacle showed how the awarding of central contracts can be a tricky business.The IRFU&rsquo;s performance director David Nucifora is paid a lot of money to make those tough calls, and while hindsight is great, there is no doubt that not keeping Ryan in the country was a big mistake.Munster put a decent offer on the table, and although it wasn&rsquo;t enough, one wonders, if privately at least, there are regrets at not doing more. Soon after extending his stay, Heaslip was forced to retire, while in the three years since, Ryan has become one of the most influential players for an outstanding Racing team, who are on the verge of winning their first Heineken Champions Cup.The problem is, Ryan was just as vital for Munster in 2017 as he is for Racing now. You only have to look at the lengths Munster have gone to in their efforts to fill the void left by their talismanic second-row.Other locks have come and gone, yet none of them have come close to replacing Ryan.RG Snyman will hopefully be the one to do so, but the injured Springbok faces a long road back.His fellow South African Jean Kleyn has impressed in fits and starts, while Gerbrandt Grobler left after just one season.Then there were the loan deals for Mark Flanagan and Jed Holloway, as well as a host of young locks such as Darren O&rsquo;Shea, Seán O&rsquo;Connor and John Madigan, who have all since left.Tadhg Beirne was an important signing, yet he is a very different kind of player to Ryan, who has had his injury problems in the past.Munster, and indeed Ireland, have been desperately crying out for that aggressive, hard-nosed edge that Ryan once again brought in spades during last weekend&rsquo;s win over Saracens.Having watched Leinster struggle to live with Saracens' power, Ryan went toe-to-toe with Maro Itoje whose influence was negated by his opposite number.The 47-times-capped former Ireland international hasn&rsquo;t exactly reinvented himself in Pairs, but he quickly realised that if he was to prolong his career at the top, then he had to adjust certain parts of his game.In his autobiography, Paul O&rsquo;Connell talks about having been blown away by Ryan&rsquo;s pace, so much so that he came to the same conclusion about his own game.Ryan has always been one of the smartest players on the pitch as he showed against Saracens by constantly stifling their maul threat, which Leinster were unable to contain, as well as winning a couple of crucial turnovers.That kind of rugby intellect, especially around the lineout, doesn&rsquo;t come around too often and while Ireland have moved on, no one could deny that Ryan was needed in Japan last year.Racing&rsquo;s younger players are feeding off his leadership and will certainly benefit from having such a role model at the club, but it&rsquo;s hard to get around the fact that he should still be fulfilling the same role in this country.Munster and Ireland&rsquo;s loss has undoubtedly been Racing&rsquo;s gain, and as Ryan rages against the dying of the light, his absence continues to be felt closer to home.Lifting the Champions Cup on October 17 would further highlight why, despite his advancing years, Ryan has been a huge loss to Irish rugby.

FAYETTEVILLE -- What four touchdowns underdog Arkansas did so defensively effectively to lead No. 4 Georgia 10-5 midway into last Saturday's third quarter won't necessarily translate so effectively this Saturday at Mississippi State.


   


  But what sophomore receiver Treylon Burks achieved in Fayetteville against Georgia would translate in Starkville, Miss. and then some if utilized more, first-year Arkansas Coach Sam Pittman implied.


   


  Though eventually losing the season-opener 37-10, Arkansas' defense put up a fight far better than the final score indicates.


   


  Arkansas' own offense directly handed Georgia nine points. Arkansas receiver T.J. Hammonds on a failed trick play fumbled out of the end zone for a first- half safety. In the second half Arkansas quarterback Feleipe Franks threw a pick-six as two Razorbacks receivers collided, Pittman said. Georgia cornerback Eric Stokes pilfered the pass and returned it for a 30-yard TD game.


   


  Another Georgia score was ultimately table set by another failed trick play with receiver Burks throwing an interception.


   


  Arkansas special teams struggled some, too. They yielded lengthy Georgia kick and punt returns and suffered a punt block. Combined with Georgia superb punter Jake Camarda pinning the Hogs' field position plight, and a delay of game penalty voiding the 54-yard field goal that Arkansas' A.J. Reed kicked, all eventually contributed to Arkansas' defeat.


   


  But an Arkansas defense holding Georgia without a touchdown for nearly 39 minutes and Burks catching 7 passes for 102 yards including that 49-yard first quarter touchdown from Franks shines through the loss.


   


  "He's a really good player," Pittman said of Burks. "We certainly have to continue to try to get the ball to him more. He can win contested catches and he's a special player. We have to continue to run him a little bit more and get the ball to him more.The touchdown grab he made and scored on was an exceptional play. I think that'll be things to come, but we've got to target him more. The defense and Treylon Burks were probably the positives for today."


   


  Seems Burks and senior running back Rakeem Boyd, 1,133 yards rushing last year but thwarted to 21 yards on 11 carries by a Georgia unit returning eight starters from last year's national rushing defense leader, must excel for Arkansas standing a chance to outpoint Mississippi State.


   


  Stopping Georgia's running game but yielding a 20 for 29 for 211 yards and two touchdowns passing day by Georgia junior off the bench junior quarterback Stetson Bennett, Arkansas' defense Saturday faces a SEC record-setting passing attack.


   


  Mike Leach, formerly the Texas Tech and Washington State head coach, debuted his "Air Raid" offense last Saturday at Mississippi State with graduate transfer via Stanford to MSU quarterback K.J. Costello. Costello threw a SEC record 623 yards in a game throwing back reigning national champion and nationally No. 6 LSU.


   


  So, Arkansas mostly shutting down Georgia's running game doesn't translate to a Mississippi State throwing 60 passes and running just 16 times against LSU.


   


  Other than defensive confidence gained, Odom's game plan this week starts from scratch.


   


  "I mean them beating LSU," Arkansas freshman safety Jalen Catalon said. "That just shows they're a really good football team."


   


  And, make that 8-out-of-10, instead of 7-of-10 nationally ranked football opponents the Arkansas Razorbacks face in 2020.


   


  MSU, unranked in the AP preseason poll and its first poll thereafter, vaulted to No. 16 after their 44-34 stunning upset last Saturday over the then sixth- ranked reigning national champion LSU Tigers at the Bayou Bengals lair in Baton Rouge, La.


   


  Mississippi State and Bulldogs Coach Mike Leach's Air Raid offense, setting a SEC record 623 passing yards on LSU, await the Razorbacks at 6:30 p.m. Saturday in Starkville, Miss. on the SEC Network Alternate.


   


  Arkansas opened its entirely SEC 10-game schedule losing 37-10 after a 10-5 third-quarter lead over the nationally fourth-ranked Georgia Bulldogs last Saturday at Reynolds Razorback Stadium.


   


  Arkansas' SEC gauntlet otherwise includes Oct. 10 at No. 7 Auburn; Oct. 31 at No. 13 Texas A&M; Nov. 7 hosting No. 21 Tennessee ; Nov. 14 at No. 3 Florida; Nov. 21 at now No. 21 LSU, and Dec. 5 hosting No. 2 Alabama.


   


  Only Ole Miss, coming Oct. 17 to Fayetteville, and Missouri, hosting Arkansas Nov. 28 in Columbia, Mo. dot Arkansas' schedule currently unranked.

“This is the modern-day NFL right here, the athletic quarterback who can still sling it around, be off schedule and creative, and make something out of nothing,” said Doug Flutie, who had a reputation for improvising in his two decades in the NFL and the Canadian Football League. “They’re everything I tried to be as a quarterback. It’s so much fun to watch them.”


  The emerging rivalry between Mahomes and Jackson is also the most significant matchup between marquee Black quarterbacks, a position that had been historically off-limits to nonwhites, in league history. There have been other showdowns between Black quarterbacks, including Michael Vick and Donovan McNabb. But neither of them was voted most valuable player or had such extraordinary success so early in his career.


  And while there were 10 Black starting quarterbacks in Week 1 this season, including Russell Wilson of the Seattle Seahawks and Dak Prescott of the Dallas Cowboys, who faced each other for the fourth time Sunday in a 38-31 Seattle win, Mahomes and Jackson have become the faces of the NFL, both on and off the field.


  “These two guys are at the top of the chain,” said Warren Moon, the most prominent Black quarterback of his generation. “These guys are not just quarterbacks for their teams, they are getting heavy endorsements and they’re lending their voices to social justice causes.”

Not only do many Britons have more free time because they are on furlough, but the coronavirus pandemic has also made outdoor pastimes more attractive.


  At the same time, the price of gold has surged close to $2,000 an ounce, and interest in it has also been propelled by the news that Scotland’s first commercial gold mine plans to start production in November.


  “I never thought in a million years I would be in a river in Scotland panning for gold,” said Popovich, 52, who works for a pharmaceutical distribution company. He is originally from Detroit but has lived for 19 years in Scotland.


  But now on furlough and with time on his hands, it seemed the obvious thing to do.


  “What else am I going to do? Go to the pub? I don’t think so. I don’t even want to go to a restaurant because of COVID,” he said, as he reflected on how he came to pitch a small tent in a stretch of countryside where getting a cellphone signal requires climbing to the top of a hill.


  Along the river bank, Suzie McGraw, who is from Glasgow and who has been a regular visitor to the area since childhood, said she had never seen as many people there as she had this year. Sitting next to her around a campfire, Mat White, from Leeds in England, said 33 people had joined a Facebook page about gold panning in one evening.


  “There’s a gold rush,” he said. “It’s crazy.”


  If so, it wouldn’t be the first. Scotland experienced at least two documented 19th-century gold rushes after news of discoveries in California caused a global sensation. But rather than riches, those bursts of interest mostly delivered disappointment.


  One, the Sutherland rush in 1868 and 1869 in the Scottish Highlands, yielded modest quantities of gold. But during a stampede to Kinnesswood, in eastern Scotland, from May to July 1852, around 2,000 people hoping to find a life- changing fortune discovered only “fool’s gold” — valueless iron pyrites.


  “It shows you the power back then, as sometimes today, of gold fever and that people will throw caution to the wind where there is a possibility of easy profit,” said Douglas Speirs, archaeologist for Fife County, near Kinnesswood.


  Nobody in the hills near Wanlockhead is expecting to get rich, however. While 1 gram of gold is worth around 50 pounds, or about $65, that would be a good find for a day. The ambition of most is to collect enough tiny fragments — or “pickers,” in panning jargon — to create a ring for a loved one.


  Serious money may well be made around 100 miles to the north, near the village of Tyndrum, where there really is gold in the imposing hills — or braes, as they are called in Scottish. The metal comes from the Dalradian rock formation that runs east from Scandinavia beneath Scotland and Northern Ireland and on to Newfoundland.

It also makes the Bulls that much easier to guard for opposing teams. The Bulls attempted just 7.6 mid-range jumpers per game this season, which ranks 25th in the league. Without that mid-range game, it made their offense predictable, which wouldn't be a problem if this roster was built like the Utah Jazz, who attempted the same number of mid-range jumpers as the Bulls, but also led the league in 3-point percentage (38 percent) on 35.2 attempts per game. Chicago wasn't efficient at shooting 3s this season, so taking out an entire area of the floor where the players shouldn't score from makes no sense.
 It's not just the Bulls, though. It's a league-wide trend. Teams are relying more and more on advanced analytics, which are saying that mid-range jumpers aren't as valuable or as efficient a shot as points in the paint and 3-pointers. While on paper that may be true, not every team in the league is built to exclusively adhere to those analytics, and Chicago certainly falls under that category.
 Luckily, though, Donovan's comments at the introductory press conference should mean that the Bulls will look slightly different on offense next season. Although Chicago doesn't have a floor general with the mid-range game comparable to Chris Paul that Donovan had in Oklahoma City, you can still bet that he's going to play to the strengths of his players. That means that someone like Lauri Markkanen may finally be able to showcase the entirety of his skills, rather than be relegated to a spot-up 3-point shooter most of the time.

"An employee tested positive for COVID-19, and the rest of the team was not notified and the store remained open. The employer claimed there was 'no exposure,'" Lawson wrote in his complaint. "Additionally, the employer instructed the positive employee to not tell any coworkers or post anything on social media about their positive test. This put the team and the local community at serious risk for the spread of the coronavirus."


  Through OSHA, workers like Lawson are able to file anonymous complaints about unsafe working conditions. OSHA then conducts investigations into complaints. OSHA was established under the umbrella of the United States Department of Labor in 1970 to protect workers and set national standards for working conditions.


  "OSHA is committed to protecting America's workers during the pandemic and has been working around the clock to that end," an OSHA spokesperson told Business Insider. "As of September 22, OSHA inspections alone have helped ensure more than 615,000 workers are protected from COVID-19."


  OSHA later clarified that the 615,000 "represents the number of workers who were covered during each inspection conducted since Feb. 1, 2020, and thus removed from hazards."

“It’s a big motivation to the team,” Grant said Monday to start Week 4, which will see Miami (1-2) host the Seattle Seahawks (3-0) at Hard Rock Stadium on Sunday.

  “We got the first win, the blood in the water, and we smell it from a mile away. And now we’re chasing it down, finding out what’s dying in the water, and what prey we’re going to eat.”


  Well, it sounds like the Dolphins are confident.


  And that’s an encouraging sign for a team that has won just six out of 13 games dating back to the start of their rebuilding effort.


  After an offseason full of roster retooling, Flores and his Dolphins players began to hear the unrest following their 0-2 start this season, which could have increased tremendously had they fallen to 0-3.


  The Dolphins were not favored to win their game against the Jaguars, according to oddsmakers, and many NFL pundits also believed Miami’s poor start would continue in Jacksonville.


  “Winning is hard in the league. ... We are going to use this motivation going into next week,” receiver Preston Williams said after the victory over the Jaguars.

Oakland opened the series by winning 5-3 (Mark Mulder allowed one run in 6 ⅔ innings) and 2-0 (Tim Hudson held N.Y. to six hits in eight innings) at Yankee Stadium. Then came fateful Game 3 at the Coliseum, a classic pitchers' duel between New York's Mike Mussina (seven innings, four hits, no runs) and Oakland's Barry Zito (eight innings, two hits, one run). The A's appeared ready to tie the game in the seventh on Terrence Long's double into the right-field corner, but the relay from Shane Spencer to shortstop Derek Jeter, who caught the ball along the first-base line and then somehow flipped it to catcher Jorge Posada, cut down Jeremy Giambi at the plate. Giambi did not slide. The Yankees rolled in the final two games, 9-2 at the Coliseum and 5-3 in the Bronx.

Gurugram In anticipation of a possible vaccine for Covid-19, the district health department will be conducting a thorough assessment of the available 'cold chain' infrastructure in the coming weeks, officials confirmed on Monday. The exercise will take stock of available cold chain equipment (CCE), such as walk-in freezers, walk-in coolers, ice-lined refrigerators and temperature-monitoring devices, which are used in the storage and transportation of vaccines. The assessment will also identify potential sites for bulk storage of vaccines, known as cold chain points (CCP).Dr Naresh Garg, district immunisation officer and nodal officer for cold chain management in Gurugram, said, "We have not received an official intimation about the same, but are aware that Central orders have been issued earlier this month. As soon as we get the order from the state National Health Mission, we shall begin the task." Prabjot Singh, mission director, NHM, Haryana, did not respond to requests for comment on Monday.A senior doctor working with the NHM's Universal Immunisation Program (UIP) in Haryana, seeking anonymity, confirmed that as per a central NHM order issued earlier this month, all states and union territories in India will be expected to create district-level plans for storage and delivery of Covid-19 vaccines within the next month. Task forces to oversee this preparation are expected to be constituted at the district- and block-levels. "The main challenge in the delivery of this vaccine will be the immunisation coverage. The target population for our routine immunisation drives is confined to infants, children and mothers. With Covid-19, we have to vaccinate the population at large, which has not been done before," the official said, adding that the vaccine would likely be administered in phases, beginning with health workers and high-risk groups. Health department officials in the district added that in addition to assessing the availability of cold chain infrastructure, they will also be making plans to train an adequate number of qualified technicians in cold chain management. "Retaining the integrity of the vaccine requires its storage at a certain temperature. Otherwise, it will lose its efficiency. We will need to identify and train qualified cold chain managers, cold chain handlers and cold chain technicians for this purpose," said Garg. Gurugram district, which currently has 39 existing CCPs for storage and delivery of vaccines, also serves as the regional storage point for immunisation programs in four other districts, namely Faridabad, Rewari, Palwal and Jhajjar.

Long term care facilities are raising the alarm that testing costs and a lack of new funding could push many nursing homes to the brink of financial ruin, advocates told legislators Monday.


   


  Without action, there are worries that a rash of nursing homes will have to be taken over by the state, a process known as receivership. That could significantly hurt older Kansans without state or federal action, industry officials say.


   


  Holly Noble, a representative from the Kansas Adult Care Executives Association, told the Joint KanCare Oversight Committee that the problem stemmed in part from testing mandates from the federal government.


   


  The requirements, handed down earlier this summer by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, differ based off how many cases exist in the surrounding county.


   


  For those counties in the red zone, which mandates twice-weekly testing of all staff, vendors and other personnel, costs can run upwards of $5,000 to $10,000 per round of testing.


   


  "You're testing your vendors, your volunteers, your staff," Noble said. "If you're one of the larger homes you might have 500 staff members."


   


  Costs are so high that when the federal government moved the home in Attica where Noble works from the red zone to the green zone based on updated state data the savings was significant. Homes in green zone counties only need to test once monthly.


   


  And while the federal government pushed out testing supplies to many homes, most have run through their allowance and are having to rely on private labs.


   


  State officials acknowledged last week that many nursing homes are struggling to access needed testing supplies and funding remained a significant concern for many facilities.


   


  Committee Chair Brenda Landwehr, R-Wichita, said that similar constraints were not placed on hospitals.


   


  "I don't know why we're putting more pressure on you to do this in the health care field because our hospitals know what they're doing," she said.


   


  Janis DeBoer, deputy secretary for the Kansas Department for Aging and Disability Services, said that state lawmakers elected to roll federal coronavirus relief aid initially earmarked for nursing home testing into the state's broader testing plan.


   


  Lawmakers charged with appropriating the money decided that the state would be better served taking an all-encompassing approach.


   


  "It will all be folded into a collaborative initiative," DeBoer said.


   


  But the federal testing mandates exacerbate other issues which already exist for long term care facilities, Noble said.


   


  Facilities were already having trouble attracting staff, something compounded by the pandemic.


   


  Twice-weekly testing requirements could lead employees to seek work elsewhere.


   


  "I can go down the road to McDonald's and get paid $15-an-hour and not have to worry about testing," Noble said.


   


  And a host of uncertainties exist, such as whether Noble's facility will be able to get their federal Paycheck Protection Program loan forgiven or not. Flu season also brings a host of new issues, including a renewed demand for personal protective equipment, which some homes are still having trouble accessing.


   


  Ultimately, the strain could force facilities to go into receivership--which would be disastrous, Landwehr said, for a state population that is getting older


   


  "If these facilities go under, it is not a good thing for the state to be taking them into receivership, we all know that," she said. "We've worked to really get out of that business because that means less care for our aging population and Kansas is a graying state."


   


  To help ease funding woes, a whole host of providers, including long term care facilities, were set to see an increase in the rates they are paid for services rendered to Medicaid patients.


   


  But those plans were scrapped after the pandemic, with Gov. Laura Kelly canceling out many of the reimbursement rate hikes as part of her plan to balance the state's books.


   


  A $9 million increase for groups which provide in-home care and disability services was among the bumps which were wiped out, according to Matt Fletcher of the advocacy group InterHab.


   


  Many providers had already factored the increases into their budgets, he said, including raises for staff who had been on the frontlines during the pandemic.


   


  Matt Johnstone, director of business operations for Maxim Healthcare Services, said that the proposed rate increase would still have fallen short of "where we needed to be at."


   


  The ultimate decision to keep the rate where it was last year he said, creates even more problems for providers.


   


  "It becomes harder and harder every year to retain and train out staff," he said. "The problem is compounded every year."


   


  Lawmakers questioned the wisdom of the cuts, noting that the state will wind up having to pay more on the back-end if Medicaid recipients wind up in the hospital.


   


  "We're probably spending more than $8.9 million for hospital stays ... we've got to sit down and run that math to realize that we're cutting off a foot that could be used to help in other ways because we're using it to pay for hospital stays," Landwehr said.


   


  Other stakeholders pushed the state to continue boosting telemedicine services, which have been used increasingly for all patients during the pandemic.


   


  Kyle Kessler, executive director of the Association of Community Mental Health Centers of Kansas said that using telemedicine to deliver mental health services had been especially valuable for Medicaid recipients.


   


  And at a time when rates of depression, substance abuse and suicidal ideation have increased, ensuring that mental health services provided over telemedicine would be reimbursed at the same rate as those conducted in person was vital, he said.


   


  "We hope our state will allow whatever [the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services] continues to allow us to do," Kessler said.


   


  Kessler said that the mental health community would benefit from expanding the number of Kansans eligible for Medicaid, something long desired by Gov. Laura Kelly and a bipartisan group of allies but which has sunk in the legislature.


   


  "Expansion of Medicaid will provide coverage for those who have a mental illness or mental health issues so they can access needed mental health treatment in their communities," Kessler said.

There is, after eight months of living with Covid, no consensus that the priority is public health and the protection of life.

Further proving that Film Twitter stans can perhaps become excellent casting directors one day, Steven Soderbergh has landed an all-star cast full of internet darlings for his latest film, _No Sudden Move_. The film is officially set for release on HBO Max and begins production on September 28, per a release. The cast includes Don Cheadle, Benicio del Toro, David Harbour, Amy Seimetz, Jon Hamm, Ray Liotta, Kieran Culkin, Brendan Fraser, Noah Jupe, Julia Fox, and more. From Lily Allen’s new husband to Roman Roy to _Honey Boy_ star Noah Jupe, the cast is full of faves. Not a single frame has been shot but let the stanning begin. Written by Ed Solomon ( _Bill & Ted Face the Music_), _No Sudden Move_ follows a group of petty criminals in 1955 Detroit hired to steal what they believe is a harmless document. When the plan inevitably goes wrong, their search for answers “weaves them through all echelons of the race-torn, rapidly changing city.”

During uncertain and dramatically changing conditions, we must assess and challenge our value proposition. We can do this in countless ways including conducting research and staying close to our customers. But we must also not overreact. In other words, we must halt our pursuit and investment in new ideas and plans that aren’t working but also ignite and escalate those that are. The key is to demonstrate and apply discipline AND flexibility, knowing when to stay the course and when to drive incremental or even transformational change. How you do that is a whole other discussion. But it starts with consciously being aware of these key principles and practices.

This is not the deep brain biopsy that we talk about, he quipped, referring to other tests that require a swab deep in the nasal passage.


  After sealing it up, 'Then you wait 15 minutes. And that is the test.'


  He said it can be supervised by a medical professional or done at home in a pinch.


  Trump said 50 million tests will go to 'most vulnerable communities' including nursing homes, assisted living facilities, home health and hospice care. Nearly 1 million will be sent to historically black colleges and universities and tribal nation colleges.


  He said 100 million tests would be given to states and territories to 'support efforts to reopen their economies and schools immediately and (as) fast as they can.'


  'The support my administration is providing would allow every state on a very regular basis test every teacher who needs it,' he said.


  Trump said 6.5 million tests will go out this week and the rest in coming weeks.


  Trump is trying to show progress in the battle against the pandemic as he campaigns for re-election on Nov. 3 against Democrat Joe Biden. The first presidential debate will be held on Tuesday night in Cleveland, Ohio.


  The rapid tests announced by Trump were purchased from Abbott Laboratories in August for sending to governors of states and territories to support school reopenings and other critical tasks.


  Abbott has said it would scale production capacity to 50 million tests per month by October and that it could currently produce 'tens of millions' of the tests, indicating it will take at least a few months for the tests to be fully distributed to states and territories.


  At the Rose Garden event leader of the Trump coronavirus task force, Admiral Brett Giroir, demonstrated how to conduct the Abbott rapid test, swabbing his nasal passages and dipping the swab into a test solution that will provide a result in about 15 minutes.
