ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — The strongest field of the year at The Players Championship will be without the biggest draw in golf. Tiger Woods isn't playing. Woods will miss The Players Championship for the first time when not recovering from any of his nine surgeries. His agent, Mark Steinberg at Excel Sports Management, said in a text, “Back just not ready. Not long term concern.” Woods has played only two times this year, a tie for ninth at Torrey Pines and last place at the Genesis Invitational at Riviera, where he serves as tournament host. Woods shot 76-77 on the weekend at Riviera in the Pacific chill and said his back was a little stiff. He decided at the last minute not to play the World Golf Championships event in Mexico. He didn't play the Honda Classic for the second straight year, and then he chose not play the Arnold Palmer Invitational at Bay Hill, where he has won a record eight times. The Players was seen as a likely return, except that Woods isn't ready. Woods has been saying all year that he plans to play fewer events, mainly so the 44-year-old with five knee surgeries and four back surgeries can stay in golf longer. He is a two-time winner on the TPC Sawgrass, most recently in 2013. Woods had the first of four back operatons the following year and was at The Players only once over the next four years, a tie for 69th in 2015. He ended that season with two more back surgeries. Before that, Woods missed The Players in 2008 when it was held in May. He had arthroscopic knee surgery after the Masters that year and didn't play again until the U.S. Open at Torrey Pines, which he won despite shredded ligaments in his left knee and a double stress fracture in his leg. That limits the amount of golf Woods will play leading into his title defense at the...

Quite what that impact will be is totally unclear. It depends, most obviously, on how fast it spreads in this country.
 It depends on how consumers react: Do they stay home and stop spending? Do businesses have to cut back activity if one of their employees falls sick? What does this do for broader activity across the economy?
 These are questions for which, for the time being, we don't have answers.
 Indeed, the outbreak is so recent that it is not yet reflected in any economic data and won't find its way on to the national statistics for some months.
 As I understand, the economic forecasts produced by the Office for Budget Responsibility next week - the ones that underpin the budget's sums - were laid to bed before the worst of the share price falls in recent weeks.

 Google's Pixel 4 devices come with plenty of power under the hood, thanks to their Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 and 64GB of storage. And since the devices are each running on a standard Android 10 software, you'll be sure to get Android the way it was meant to be designed.
 Tom's Guide reviewed the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL and awarded both models four stars out of five. They're among the best Android phones you can get. Currently at their all-time price low, they're outstanding options if you're on a budget and in the market for an Android device.

Drag queen Sherry Pie has been disqualified from the current 12th season of _RuPaul's Drag Race_ , TV executives announced Friday, one day after BuzzFeed News reported allegations from five men that they had been catfished by the performer posing as a casting director.
 Joey Gugliemelli, better known by his drag persona Sherry Pie, is alleged to have deceived his former classmates at SUNY Cortland in New York, as well as actors he worked with in a Nebraska theater company. One of the young men said he even agreed to masturbate on camera as part of the audition process.
 “In light of recent developments and Sherry Pie’s statement, Sherry Pie has been disqualified from _RuPaul’s Drag Race_ ," a spokesperson for VH1 and production company World of Wonder said in a statement to BuzzFeed News.
 "Out of respect for the hard work of the other queens, VH1 will air the season as planned," the spokesperson said. "Sherry will not appear in the grand finale scheduled to be filmed later this spring."
 In a statement on Facebook on Thursday night, Gugliemelli said he was sorry that he "caused such trauma and pain."
 "I know that the pain and hurt that I have caused will never go away and I know that what I did was wrong and truly cruel," he said.
 Gugliemelli also said he was “seeking help and receiving treatment.”
 “I truly apologize to everyone I have hurt with my actions,” he wrote. “I also want to say how sorry I am to my sisters of season 12 and honestly the whole network and production company.”
 Gugliemelli did not respond to a request for comment on Friday, nor multiple requests for comment on Thursday.

You’re (No.) 11 in yards and (No.) 24 in points there’s an issue. It’s defense. It’s special teams. It’s not scoring in the red zone and not scoring in goal-to-go. To me, those are the issues.
