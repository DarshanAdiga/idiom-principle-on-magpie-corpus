Often people with a grievance hesitate to enter a police station fearing indifferent or cold response they might get from the police personnel. Besides, they fear that they might be forced to wait for hours together.


  To put an end to these apprehensions, Commissioner of Police Prem Anand Sinha has opened reception centres at all the 27 police stations in the city. Each police station will have a receptionist, preferably a woman police constable or head constable, to receive petitioners and complainants. “We have provided furniture in the front office so that people can sit comfortably before airing their grievance,” Mr. Sinha said.


  “A major issue is that people are clueless as to whom they should approach on entering a police station. Often they are made to wait in the police station for hours together. Now the receptionist will listen to their problem and guide them to the right officer. For instance, if it is a theft, the complainant will be directed to the crime wing,” he said.


  ## No more waiting


  Mr. Sinha said one such reception centre opened due to the initiative taken by Inspector N. Selvi at Mathichiyam police station has proved to be a successful model. “The petitioner will get clarity on whom to approach for his problem. If a particular officer is not available, he will be guided to another officer or asked to come back at a particular time to meet the right officer. Thereby, the petitioner need not indefinitely wait at the police station and waste his time,” he said.


  Ms. Selvi said police personnel assigned to receive petitioners had been asked to show patience while listening to their problem. “A glass of water offered to a tense complainant can help him calm down and explain his problem lucidly,” she said.


  “Since the reception area has been set up on the portico, physical distancing is also being maintained,” she said, pointing to many police personnel in the city getting infected with COVID-19. The station also offers masks to people who come without one.


  The reception centre will function from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. The receptionist will wear a badge for easy identification and also help in drafting the petitions for unlettered people.

WASHINGTON — The leader of the Trump administration's vaccination program says people who have been infected with the coronavirus — a group that includes President Donald Trump — should receive the vaccine.


  Moncef Slaoui, the chief adviser of Operation Warp Speed, told CNN's “State of the Union” on Sunday that the vaccine is safe for those who have recovered and offers stronger and potentially longer protection than does the virus itself.


  “We know that infection doesn’t induce a very strong immune response and it wanes over time. So I think, as a clear precaution, it is appropriate to be vaccinated because it’s safe," he said. “I think people should be vaccinated, indeed.”


  Trump is now one of the only senior-most U.S. officials who has not received the first of two vaccination shots, which began being administered last week as part of the largest vaccination campaign in the nation's history. Vice President Mike Pence, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., all were given doses Friday. President-elect Joe Biden was to receive his Monday.


  All have chosen to publicize their injections as part of a campaign to convince a skeptical public that the vaccines are safe and effective, in hopes of finally putting an end to a pandemic that has killed more than 317,000 people in the United States and upended life around the globe.


  Trump, who in the past has spread misinformation about vaccine risks, tweeted earlier this month that he was “not scheduled” to take the vaccine, but looked “forward to doing so at the appropriate time.” The White House says he is still discussing timing with his doctors.


  Trump was hospitalized with COVID-19 in October and given an experimental monoclonal antibody treatment that he credited for his swift recovery.


  A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisory board has said people who received that treatment should wait at least 90 days to be vaccinated to avoid any potential interference.


  “When the time is right, I’m sure he will remain willing to take it,” White House spokesperson Brian Morgenstern echoed Friday. “It’s just something we’re working through.”


  Trump has spent the last week largely out of sight as he continues to stew about his election loss and floats increasingly outlandish schemes to remain in power. It's an approach that has bewildered top aides who see his silence as a missed opportunity for the president, who leaves office Jan. 20, to claim credit for helping oversee the speedy development of the vaccine and to burnish his legacy.


  Trump has also come under criticism for failing to take the vaccine himself as an example to help allay concerns about its safety, especially among Republicans.


  The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices said the Pfizer- BioNTech vaccine, which was the first to receive authorization, “is safe and likely efficacious" in people who have been infected with COVID-19 and “should be offered regardless of history of prior symptomatic or asymptomatic SARS- CoV-2 infection.”


  While there is no recommended minimum wait time between infection and vaccination, because reinfection is uncommon in the three months after a person is infected, the committee said people who tested positive in the preceding 90 days "may delay vaccination until near the end of this period, if desired.”


  But the advisers also recommended that those who received the kind of treatment Trump did should put off being vaccinated for at least 90 days.


  “Currently, there are no data on the safety and efficacy of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccination in persons who received monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma as part of COVID-19 treatment," they wrote, recommending that vaccination "be deferred for at least 90 days, as a precautionary measure until additional information becomes available, to avoid interference of the antibody treatment with vaccine-induced immune responses.”


  Surgeon General Jerome Adams cited that recommendation on CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday when asked if Trump planned to receive the shot on camera.


  “From a scientific point of view, I will remind people that the president has had COVID within the last 90 days. He received the monoclonal antibodies. And that is actually one scenario where we tell people maybe you should hold off on getting the vaccine, talk to your health provider to find out the right time,” Adams said.


  White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany has given other explanations for the delay. She told reporters last week that Trump was holding off, in part, "to show Americans that our priority are the most vulnerable.”


  “The President wants to send a parallel message, which is, you know, our long-term care facility residents and our frontline workers are paramount in importance, and he wants to set an example in that regard,” she said.


  Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious diseases expert, is among those who have recommended that Trump be vaccinated without delay.


  “Even though the president himself was infected, and he has, likely, antibodies that likely would be protective, we’re not sure how long that protection lasts. So, to be doubly sure, I would recommend that he get vaccinated,” he told ABC News.

The progress of this past week could have happened in July, or in August, or in September, or in October. Senate Republicans were advocating for a package just like this one, all along, in real time. I just wish our partners on the other side had put political calculations aside and worked with us to make this happen a long time ago.”

 She informed that the programme has assisted agriculture-based households to adopt sustainable, profitable and diversified agriculture livelihoods that have increased their household income and food and nutrition security.
 Participants were informed that the programme has achieved at least a 25 percent increase in crop yield, adding, it has also enhanced the capacities of farming communities to utilize innovative agriculture practices, market their goods, develop and sustain businesses, strengthened supply chains and has connected farmers to markets across the country.
 The programme worked in specific commodities such as onions, fruit trees, livestock, wool shearing, certified seed production, poultry, dates and household food production.
 The ceremony was virtually attended by the Australian High Commission officials and programme farmers, as well as by officials from FAO and the Government of Balochistan.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice Department on Monday unsealed charges accusing a Libyan bomb expert in the 1988 explosion of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, an attack that killed 259 people in the air and an additional 11 on the ground.The charges were announced on the 32nd anniversary of the bombing and in the final news conference of Attorney General William Barr’s tenure, underscoring his personal attachment to a case that unfolded during his first stint at the Justice Department. He announced an earlier set of charges against two Libyan intelligence officials in his capacity as acting attorney general nearly 30 years ago, vowing that the investigation would continue. Though Barr had not appeared at a press conference in months, he led this one two days before his departure as something of a career bookend.In presenting new charges, the Justice Department is revisiting a case that deepened the chasm between the United States and Libya, laid bare the threat of international terrorism more than a decade before the Sept. 11 attacks and produced global investigations and punishing sanctions. In 1992, the U.N. Security Council imposed arms sales and air travel sanctions against Libya to prod Col. Moammar Gadhafi, the country’s leader, into surrendering the two suspects.But the Libyan government balked at surrendering the men to the U.S., skeptical they could receive a fair trial. Libya ultimately turned them over for prosecution before a panel of Scottish judges sitting in a Netherlands court.One man — former Libyan intelligence official Abdel Baset al-Megrahi — was convicted, and a second Libyan suspect was acquitted of all charges. Al-Megrahi was given a life sentence, but Scottish authorities released him on humanitarian grounds in 2009 when he was diagnosed with prostate cancer. He later died in Tripoli.The Pan Am flight exploded over Lockerbie less than an hour after takeoff from London on Dec. 21, 1988, en route to New York City and then Detroit. Among the Americans on board were 35 Syracuse University students flying home for Christmas after a semester abroad.The attack was the latest flare of tension between Libya and Western nations, including the U.S. In the years before the flight, for instance, Libya was blamed for the bombing of a West Berlin discotheque that killed two American soldiers and injured dozens of others. It wasn’t until 2003 that Gadhafi and Libya accepted responsibility for the Pan Am disaster, with the country formally taking blame and reaching a $2.7 billion compensation deal with the victims’ families. Sanctions were lifted and, in 2006, the Bush administration removed Libya from its list of state sponsors of terrorism and restored diplomatic relations with the country.Besides Barr, another key figure in the Lockerbie investigation was Robert Mueller, who was the Justice Department’s criminal chief at the time the first set of charges was announced. Mueller would later become FBI director and special counsel in charge of the investigation into ties between Russia and the 2016 Trump campaign.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

Bamako, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 21st Dec, 2020 ) :Three years ago West African nations launched a joint force touted as a giant's stride in the fight against Islamist militants sweeping across the Sahel.
 But lack of equipment, funds and training, together with problems in deployment and coordination on the ground, have left the so-called G5 Sahel struggling for credibility and still dependent on France, the force's big political backer.
 Planned as a seven-battalion force combining 5,000-men from Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Niger and Mauritania, the G5 is meant to bind the countries of this vast region in an alliance against a common foe.
 Thousands of people have died and hundreds of thousands have fled their homes since jihadists launched an insurgency in northern Mali in 2012, which has since spread into Niger and Burkina Faso.
 The G5 troops are supposed to operate in three corridors 200 kilometres (120 miles) on either side of common borders.

Per l’ambiente e la sicurezza sismica, segnalo la proroga fino al giugno 2022 del Superbonus 110% e fino alla fine del 2022 per gli edifici che al giugno di quell’anno hanno concluso il 60 per cento dei lavori.

Tale misura si integra con gli incentivi che abbiamo già concesso per l’acquisto di auto elettriche, e sono certa che porterà a risultati sensibili anche in Abruzzo, che vanta il titolo di “Regione verde d'Europa”. Per i nostri parchi, abbiamo istituito il Fondo nazionale per il recupero della fauna selvatica, per sostenere l'attività di tutela e cura della fauna selvatica da parte delle associazioni ambientaliste. Inoltre, cospicui aiuti ci saranno per il settore della pesca e dell’agricoltura, e arriverà un’importante novità per la filiera cerealicola, con l’istituzione di un registro per evitare che le nostre pregiate farine e cerali vengano confuse con prodotti introdotti nel Paese in maniera illegale e spacciati per locali (aumentando le garanzie anche per i consumatori)".

Bloomberg) -- At the Peterhead fishing port in Scotland, prices for haddock and monkfish were inverted on Monday, skewed by a closed border with France and a ticking clock that threatened to render some of its catch worthless.


  Haddock normally sold wholesale for up to 3 pounds ($4) per kilogram was going for 5 pounds, said Patrick Hayton, manager of Midland Fish Co., a processor in Fleetwood, England. He sources at Peterhead, Europe’s largest fishing port, and brings it back to northwest England for local sale.


  Monkfish, by comparison, would normally be bound for European tables and command a premium over the Christmas holidays. But it was selling for 2 pounds a kilo, less than half its typical price.


  The price gyrations mark the latest setback for the U.K. fishing industry, whose future is already hostage to down-to-the-wire negotiations over the terms of Britain’s departure from the European Union. With French borders closed since Sunday, thousands of pounds of seafood could be left to rot in lorries that would normally speed through the Port of Dover to Europe.


  “This is the most important sales week of the year and it’s been caught up in a hurricane,” said Jimmy Buchan, chief executive officer of the Scottish Seafood Association. “We’ve got Brexit, we’ve got Covid and now on the back of Covid we’ve got this further restriction.”


  Sinking Value


  Each shipping container headed for France with fish starts with a value of 60,000 pounds, and is at risk of dwindling to nothing if it’s delayed, said Martyn Boyers, CEO of Grimsby Fish Market in eastern England.


  Lost sales of Scottish salmon alone this week to France may total 6.5 million pounds, according to the Scottish Salmon Producers Organization. It urged the government “to explore all practical options for resuming trade, including the Covid-19 testing of drivers.”


  It’s nearly impossible to adjust on the fly to massive shifts in the market for live catch that will spoil in four days. Haddock, used in fish and chips, has a ready market within the U.K. With the holiday table already taken up by turkey, there’s not much room left for less popular monkfish.


  Many Europeans include fish in their Christmas meal preparations, and at this time of year, demand for seafood would usually be at a premium in France or Spain, said James Withers, CEO at the Scotland Food & Drink industry group.


  With the truck-ferry route to European Union markets cut off, there are few options for U.K. fishmongers. Supermarkets are already supplied for the holiday, while the hospitality industry has been largely shut down by the same strain of Covid-19 that led France and other EU countries to close off entry for at least 48 hours.


  A solution to the current border crisis may come within hours, but time is running out.


  Live shellfish such as langoustine, brown crabs and lobsters can live for 48 hours before they die, and it’s already been about 24 hours for those stuck in transit. They need to get to Europe by tomorrow morning at the latest.


  Some producers are trying to retrieve some of the live shellfish and return it to the water, Withers said.


  “There is no alternative at the moment,” he said.

  According to the farmers representative Singarayar, at least 2500 acres of chilly and other crops, including paddy, were raised in Michaelpattinam, Ponnaganeri and other surrounding places.


  They complained that on the one side the heavy rainfall had resulted in waterlogging in the fields and in some other cases, the recently desilted tanks done in 'kudimaramathu' had not been completed properly.


  As a result, the water flowed from the tank into the fields and that there was no way out for it to be drained by them, they charged.


  The farmers who had grown chilly said that they had spent a minimum of ₹ 25,000 per acre and expected the government to give them relief at the earliest.


  The Collector also gave away relief cheques to the tune of ₹10 lakh to 11 beneficiaries who had lost their kith/kin in road accidents or suffered multiple injuries. Similarly, five differently-abled people received new two- wheelers (altered) at ₹ 3.09 lakh which could be used by them, a press release said.

Despite his almost complete isolation, he remains a dominant, almost legendary figure of the Kurdish insurgency and its sympathisers across Turkey, Syria and Iraq.
 In May last year, after being allowed to see his lawyer for the first time in eight years, Ocalan called for an end to hunger strikes by thousands of jailed supporters who were surviving by drinking only salty and sugary water.
 At the time of her strike, Guven was in custody for labelling the Turkish military operation against a Syrian Kurdish militia an "invasion".
 She was freed under judicial control last year after serving a one-year term.
 "I uttered a scream in the dark... I started by daring to die for this cause," Guven told AFP in an interview at her home last year when she was on the hunger strike.
 Guven's daughter Sabiha Temizkan said her mother was convicted for her work as co-chair of the pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Congress (DTK), a civil society group which has not been banned by the Turkish state but remains under close scrutiny.
 In a tweet, Temizkan called the Turkish government "the enemy of the law".
 The left-wing HDP, which is parliament's second-largest opposition group, said the "hostile" verdict against Guven was aimed at "all Kurds and the entire opposition".
 "Leyla Guven is a person of struggle who dedicated her life to peace. She is a monument of honour," the party said.
 Both of the party's former co-chairs, including Selahattin Demirtas -- who ran against Erdogan in the 2018 presidential elections -- are currently in jail.
 Demirtas has been convicted of disseminating terror propaganda and is facing other terror-related charges.

It’s a review copy of Thomas Wolfe’s first posthumous novel, “The Web and the Rock.” It was sent to Lewis Gannett, who wrote a long-running book review column for The New York Herald Tribune.


  Now, both Wolfe and Gannett are almost forgotten. In their day, though, they were prominent men.


  In the late 1920s and into the 1930s, Wolfe was a peer of William Faulkner, F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway. Critics heralded him as the great American novelist. But he died young, more than 20 years before I was born, and time moved on.


  Gannett wrote a daily book review column. His words of praise or condemnation could make or break a writer. But the paper for which he worked is now long gone.


  But it’s not the fact that both men once were powerful figures that made the book appealing to me.


  Long, long ago, Thomas Wolfe’s books persuaded me that I could be a writer. Wolfe told autobiographical tales about a young man from an often-overlooked piece of America who dreamed of catching the stuff of life in the snare of language. When I was a college student, that spoke to me.


  His inspiration put me on the path to the life I’ve led.


  Many of my wife’s fondest childhood memories take place in northwest Connecticut, where her family lived. It was a tightknit community, the kind of place where people gathered for festive holiday parties.


  A kindly woman with a creative bent was a neighbor. She designed distinctive little Christmas ornaments for neighborhood families and children.


  The woman was a talented artist. Several of her works, all of them lovely pieces, depicting life in that little community hang on the walls of our home today.


  The woman’s name was Ruth Gannett. She was the wife and then the widow of Lewis Gannett.


  My wife does not recall Lewis Gannett well. He died around the time she started school.

DETROIT — Families of men incarcerated at Michigan’s Kinross Correctional Facility believed its remote location would spare it from a deadly COVID-19 outbreak. For a while, they seemed to be right.


  Kinross, built on the grounds of a former Air Force base in the Upper Peninsula, is closer to Canada than it is to Detroit. Unlike most prisons in Michigan, Kinross had remained almost unscathed by the novel coronavirus with only one case between March and October.


  But on Oct. 28, corrections officials transferred nine prisoners to Kinross from Marquette Branch Prison, several hours west, where COVID-19 was running rampant. There were 837 confirmed cases by late October, 350 of which were still active when the men were transferred.


  Roughly three weeks later, Kinross had its first major outbreak, corrections department data showed. Though agency officials say it’s not because of the transfers, more than 1,100 prisoners have now been infected, at least seven have died and more than 100 guards have fallen ill. The prisoners who came to Kinross had been transferred twice, sent first to Marquette after a riot where they were held, and then had tested positive for COVID-19 there before leaving for Kinross, officials said.


  In prisons around the country, COVID-19 outbreaks have followed transfers of prisoners or prison workers. Nearly all of the 25 state prison systems and the federal Bureau of Prisons that responded to a survey conducted by The Marshall Project and The Associated Press said they had reduced or limited the number of prisoners they moved due to the pandemic. Eight states halted the practice except in special circumstances. The reductions were keeping in line with medical guidelines.


  But most of those states lifted their restrictions by September and few prison systems heeded the earlier lessons as the pandemic worsened this winter, worrying families of prisoners and correctional officers who work in the prisons.

  This story is a collaboration between The Associated Press and The Marshall Project exploring the state of the prison system in the coronavirus pandemic. Cary Aspinwall reported for The Marshall Project from Dallas.


  ___


  The coronavirus has killed more than 300,000 people in the U.S., and cases are rising again this winter after leveling off in the late summer months. There have been more than 275,000 cases inside U.S. prisons. Prisons are a particular concern because social distancing is virtually nonexistent behind bars, prisoners sleep in close quarters and share bathrooms, and each prison has varying policies on personal protective equipment and who gets it.


  Oklahoma’s prisons reported relatively few cases of COVID-19 until state officials closed several units because of budget cuts, transferring more than 4,500 prisoners between facilities from late July to September. Major outbreaks followed, with more than 5,800 prisoners testing positive and at least 33 dying from the virus.


  In Amarillo, Texas, officers who worked at the Neal Unit prison were proud the facility remained unscathed by the virus, but that changed in September. That’s when strict protocols were loosened by the warden, including mandatory isolation of transferred prisoners, according to a longtime correction officer at the prison who had direct knowledge of the protocols but was not authorized to discuss them publicly and spoke to The Marshall Project on condition of anonymity.


  The virus soon took over, infecting hundreds of prisoners and killing a chaplain and a food service manager at the prison. Jeremy Desel, spokesman for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, said the cases were found mostly among prisoners who were asymptomatic and disputed the officer’s account. “There has been no relaxing of protocols. If anything they’ve been tightened,” Desel said.


  Families of those who’ve died from the virus in California prisons have directly blamed transfers for the uncontrolled spread of disease, including an outbreak at San Quentin State Prison that led to 28 deaths. The family of a prisoner who died filed a notice they would sue, alleging officials ignored health officials’ recommendations when they transferred high-risk prisoners from California Institute for Men in Chino, where an outbreak was already spreading. Health experts had warned of transfers between facilities, saying “mass movement of high-risk inmates between institutions is ill-advised and potentially dangerous,” and would likely spread the virus between prisons, according to the notice.


  Transfers have also been linked to outbreaks in the federal prison system, including a recent outbreak at the facility in Fort Dix, New Jersey. Families and advocates say it was the result of the Bureau of Prisons transferring 150 prisoners there from a facility in Ohio that’s been battling COVID-19 cases for months.


  Michigan had some of the worst and earliest outbreaks of any state prison system. About 20,000 prisoners have contracted the virus since March, and at least 102 have died. Central Michigan Correctional Facility currently has one of the largest outbreaks in the country, with more than 2,000 prisoners testing positive.


  State officials said they have followed proper infection-control protocols. Chris Gautz, a spokesman for the Michigan Department of Corrections, acknowledged the transfer of the nine men from Marquette to Kinross on Oct. 28, but insisted that transfers “are not the issue” in the virus surge.


  “We’ve looked into that,” Gautz said. “All prisoners who had previously been positive were in a step-down phase, meaning they were no longer contagious. It wasn’t until weeks later when there was a big spike in Kinross.”


  But prisoners at Kinross and their families say the virus spiked within roughly three weeks of the transfers, within the window medical experts say the virus remains contagious. Some of the men transferred still had symptoms and were moved into the prison’s general population too quickly, said Matt Tjapkes, who runs a nonprofit dedicated to prisoners’ medical rights in Michigan called Humanity for Prisoners.


  “The prisoners feel so helpless because they can’t control it and they can’t stop it,” he said. “They feel like they’re sitting ducks — and they are.”


  Corrections officers, too, are worried about the safety of transfers, said Byron Osborn, president of the union that represents most of Michigan’s correctional officers. More than 2,500 correctional staff have contracted the virus in Michigan and at least three have died.


  “There is obviously not a lot of definitive information from the communicable disease experts on the spread of the COVID-19 virus or on the topic of when infected people are no longer contagious,” Osborn said. “We believe that everyone would agree that this is problematic.”


  Families of the prisoners who’ve fallen ill at Kinross say they’re angry because the movement of prisoners is the one thing the corrections department controls.


  Amy Wallace’s husband is one of the men incarcerated at Kinross who caught the virus and recovered. But she said a state prison spokesman recently gave a statement to local media that “pinched a nerve.”


  The spokesman said it was difficult to know how COVID arrived at the prison, she recalled.


  “Well, OK. We do,” she said.


  Michigan state Sen. Ed McBroom, a Republican from the Upper Peninsula, chairs an oversight committee that has held hearings on the corrections department’s response to COVID-19. He said he has no firm knowledge that points to transfers as the culprit in spreading the virus behind bars. But he called the agency opaque and overly positive, and didn’t give it high marks for communication.


  “We have to dig in and find out why these outbreaks happen,” he said in an interview. “Were mistakes made? I just don’t know.”


  Jennifer Gross thought Kinross’ remote location might keep her fiancé, Robert Vermett, and the other men locked up there safer from the virus, even though she hasn’t been able to visit. Vermett is serving a life sentence for a murder conviction.


  Days after the transfers, Vermett told her the virus appeared to have made it inside. He got sick, too and remained seriously ill for more than two weeks.


  In an email to her on Nov. 18, shortly before he tested positive, he said: “This WHOLE F——— COMPOUND IS INFECTED. Every unit, the control center, the gym, the school, the chow hall, every where … So why are they moving anybody anywhere?”

BERLIN — A growing list of European Union nations and Canada barred travel from the U.K. on Sunday and others were considering similar action, in a bid to block a new strain of coronavirus sweeping across southern England from spreading to the continent.


  France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, Ireland and Bulgaria all announced restrictions on U.K. travel, hours after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that Christmas shopping and gatherings in southern England must be canceled because of rapidly spreading infections blamed on the new coronavirus variant.


  Johnson immediately placed those regions under a strict new Tier 4 restriction level, upending Christmas plans for millions.


  France banned all travel from the U.K. for 48 hours from midnight Sunday, including trucks carrying freight through the tunnel under the English Channel or from the port of Dover on England's south coast. French officials said the pause would buy time to find a “common doctrine” on how to deal with the threat, but it threw the busy cross-channel route used by thousands of trucks a day into chaos.


  The Port of Dover tweeted Sunday night that its ferry terminal was “closed to all accompanied traffic leaving the UK until further notice due to border restrictions in France.”


  Eurostar passenger trains from London to Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam were also halted.


  Germany said all flights coming from Britain, except cargo flights, were no longer allowed to land starting midnight Sunday. It didn’t immediately say how long the flight ban would last. Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo said he was issuing a flight ban for 24 hours starting at midnight “out of precaution.” “There are a great many questions about this new mutation,” he said, adding he hoped to have more clarity by Tuesday.


  Canada announced its own ban Sunday night. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a statement that for 72 hours starting at midnight Sunday, “all flights from the UK will be prohibited from entering Canada.” He added that travelers who arrived Sunday would be subject to secondary screening and other health measures. A follow-up statement from the government said cargo flights were not included in the ban.


  The Central American nation of El Salvador, meanwhile, said it would refuse entry to anyone who has visited Britain in the preceding 30 days.


  The British government said Johnson would preside at a meeting of the government's crisis committee, COBRA, on Monday in the wake of the other nations' measures. They come at a time of huge economic uncertainty for the U.K., less than two weeks before it leaves the EU's economic structures Dec. 31, and with talks on a new post-Brexit trade relationship still deadlocked.


  Johnson said Saturday that a fast-moving new variant of the virus that is 70% more transmissible than existing strains appeared to be driving the rapid spread of new infections in London and southern England in recent weeks. But he stressed “there’s no evidence to suggest it is more lethal or causes more severe illness,” or that vaccines will be less effective against it.


  On Sunday, British Health Secretary Matt Hancock added to the alarm when he said “the new variant is out of control.” The U.K. recorded 35,928 further confirmed cases, around double the number from a week ago.


  Germany, which holds the rotating EU presidency, called a special crisis meeting on Monday to coordinate the response to the virus news among the bloc's 27 member states.


  The Netherlands banned flights from the U.K. for at least the rest of the year. Ireland issued a 48-hour flight ban. Italy said it would block flights from the U.K. until Jan.6, and an order signed Sunday prohibits entry into Italy by anyone who has been in the U.K. in the last 14 days.


  The Czech Republic imposed stricter quarantine measures from people arriving from Britain.


  Beyond Europe, Israel also said it was banning flights from Britain, Denmark and South Africa because those were the countries where the mutation is found.


  The World Health Organization tweeted late Saturday that it was "in close contact with U.K. officials on the new #COVID19 virus variant" and promised to update governments and the public as more is learned.


  The new strain was identified in southeastern England in September and has been spreading in the area ever since, a WHO official told the BBC on Sunday.


  “What we understand is that it does have increased transmissibility, in terms of its ability to spread,” said Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO’s technical lead on COVID-19.


  Studies are under way to better understand how fast it spreads and whether “it’s related to the variant itself, or a combination of factors with behavior,” she added.


  She said the strain had also been identified in Denmark, the Netherlands and Australia, where there was one case that didn't spread further.


  “The longer this virus spreads, the more opportunities it has to change,” she said. “So we really need to do everything we can right now to prevent spread."


  Viruses mutate regularly, and scientists have found thousands of different mutations among samples of the virus causing COVID-19. Many of these changes have no effect on how easily the virus spreads or how severe symptoms are.


  British health authorities said that while the variant has been circulating since September, it wasn’t until the last week that officials felt they had enough evidence to declare that it has higher transmissibility than other circulating coronaviruses.


  Patrick Vallance, the British government’s chief scientific adviser, said officials are concerned about the new variant because it contained 23 different changes, “an unusually large number of variants” affecting how the virus binds to and enters cells in the body.


  Officials aren't certain whether it originated in the U.K., Vallance added. But by December, he said it was causing over 60% of infections in London.


  U.S. President-elect Joe Biden’s nominee for U.S. surgeon general said Sunday that the emergence of the new strain doesn’t change the public health guidance on precautions for reducing the spread of the virus, such as wearing masks, social distancing and washing hands.


  “While it seems to be more easily transmissible, we do not have evidence yet that this is a more deadly virus to an individual who acquires it,” Vivek Murthy said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “There’s no reason to believe that the vaccines that have been developed will not be effective against this virus, as well.”


  Europe has been walloped this fall by soaring new infections and deaths due to a resurgence of the virus, and many nations have reimposed a series of restrictions to reign in their outbreaks.


  Britain has seen over 67,000 deaths in the pandemic, the second-highest confirmed toll in Europe after Italy. Europe as a whole has recorded nearly 499,000 virus deaths, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University that experts believe is an undercount, due to limited testing and missed cases.


  The European Medicines Agency, meanwhile, is meeting Monday to approve the first COVID-19 vaccine for the European Union's 27 nations, bringing vaccinations closer for millions of EU citizens. The vaccine made by German pharmaceutical company BioNTech and American drugmaker Pfizer is already in use in the United States, Britain, Canada and other countries.


  The EMA moved up its assessment of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine by a week after heavy pressure from EU governments, especially Germany, which has said that after the EMA approval it could start vaccinating citizens as early as next Sunday.


  In an urgent address to the nation on Saturday, Johnson ordered all non- essential shops, hairdressers and gyms in London and large parts of southern England closed and told Britons to reorganize their holiday plans. No mixing of households is allowed indoors in the region, and only essential travel is permitted. In the rest of England, people will be allowed to meet in Christmas bubbles for just one day instead of the five that were planned.


  After he spoke, videos emerged online showing crowds of people at London's train stations, apparently making a dash for places in the U.K. with less stringent coronavirus restrictions. Health Secretary Matt Hancock called those scenes "totally irresponsible.”


  While Hancock insisted officials had acted “very quickly and decisively,” critics said Britain's Conservative government should have moved against rising infections much earlier.


  “The alarms bells have been ringing for weeks, but the prime minister chose to ignore them,” said Keir Starmer, leader of the opposition Labour Party. “It is an act of gross negligence by a prime minister who, once again, has been caught behind the curve.”

Our field encompasses such subdomains as malware analysis, penetration testing, code review, forensics, threat intelligence, risk assessment, compliance, cryptography, network monitoring, and incident response. It requires understanding other domains, including software development, application architecture, information architecture, data visualization, law, basic business principles, and effective communication. It occasionally requires knowledge from fields like geopolitics, global economics, counterterrorism, behavioral psychology, and statistical methods.

 Harvested deer can be taken to the Killdeer Plains Wildlife Area Headquarters, located at 19100 County Highway 115, Harpster. Wildlife professionals will be on-site to sample deer from 9 a.m.-7 p.m. Questions can be directed to 1-800-WILDLIFE (945-3543).
 Hunters are asked to provide their confirmation number from the game check process as well as the location where the deer was taken (the address of the property or nearest road intersection are acceptable). The process should take no more than 10 minutes. Hunters are strongly encouraged to complete the game check process prior to arriving.
 Each sample will be provided a unique specimen number which can be used to check results in approximately eight weeks. Results can be found under the District Two Enhanced Surveillance Results tab on the Chronic Wasting Disease page at wildohio.gov.
 Hunters who plan to take their harvested deer to a taxidermist do not need to submit a sample at Killdeer Plains Wildlife Area. Call 1-800-WILDLIFE (945-3543) with the harvest location and taxidermist name, and a sample will be collected from the taxidermist for testing.
 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there is no strong evidence that CWD is transmissible to humans. However, hunters are encouraged to wear rubber gloves when field dressing deer and avoid consuming high-risk tissues such as the brain, spinal cord, eyes, spleen, tonsils and lymph nodes.
 Hunters should dispose of carcasses by double-bagging any high-risk tissues and including them in household trash to be delivered to a landfill. Those who hunt out-of-state can help prevent the spread of CWD by following carcass regulations and not bringing high-risk tissues across state lines.
 The Division of Wildlife has conducted routine surveillance for CWD since 2002, testing more than 25,000 deer without finding a CWD positive deer in the wild herd. CWD has previously been detected at captive deer breeding facilities in Ohio. Find more information about Ohio's CWD surveillance at wildohio.gov.
 CWD has been detected in 26 states and four Canadian provinces. The disease was first discovered in the 1960s in the western U.S. More information about this disease is available at cwd-info.org.

So, if you have good content on your website, make sure that you use some solid keywords that your potential clients will be searching for and, soon enough, a connection can be made. If you are local and have good SEO content, then you should be able to capture some of that local user traffic.

Bloomberg) -- IRhythm Technologies Inc., which has drawn the wrath of short sellers as shares have more than tripled this year, could receive key reimbursement decisions in coming weeks that will shape its sales.


  Regional contractors that work with the U.S. government to decide how much IRhythm will be reimbursed for use of its products are expected to weigh in, after the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services updated its coding at the start of this month. The Medicare administrative contractors, or MACs, may cut reimbursement levels related to the company’s Zio heartbeat-monitoring patch, which would deal a blow to the stock’s boosters.


  The San Francisco-based device maker has become a battleground for bulls and bears as shares have surged more than 1,200% since going public in 2016. IRhythm has been targeted by money managers including Kerrisdale Capital Management LLC and Lakewood Capital Management LP in recent years over the reimbursement hurdles and competitive threats it faces.


  The new, permanent coding from CMS punts the reimbursement terms to the MACs while the federal agency better assesses the rates IRhythm should be paid. While the medical utility of IRhythm’s Zio to detect irregular heart rhythms isn’t a focal point, short sellers have highlighted the notable discrepancy among rates that different MACs pay.


  Kerrisdale said in a March 2019 short report that Noridian Healthcare Solutions LLC was reimbursing Zio for about $33 in Idaho, compared to Novitas Solutions Inc.’s reimbursement of $267 to $365 in states like Mississippi and New Jersey. Kerrisdale’s Sahm Adrangi said in an email that the firm is still short IRhythm while Lakewood did not respond to an email requesting comment.


  “Novitas does pay a strikingly high rate compared to the other MACs,” James Muller, founder of Muller Consulting & Data Analytics LLC, said by telephone. Muller wrote a letter to CMS in October that helped drive the agency to change the coding for products including IRhythm’s Zio XT.


  Muller said his analysis suggests the appropriate pricing would be “in the ballpark of $65 for the shorter service to $85 to $95 for the 15 day service.” For investors there is a “genuine risk here” because it is “entirely possible” the MACs may reconsider their policies and lower the payment for these services, he continued.


  Shares of IRhythm have surged 235% this year compared to a 45% rise for the Russell 2000 Health Care Index. Meanwhile, about 13% of available shares are sold short, according to data compiled by financial analytics firm S3 Partners, representing more than $850 million in bets against the company. That’s more than double the $285 million seen at a 2020 low in March.


  IRhythm said in an emailed statement that it is working with MACs, like Novitas, to establish pricing for the new code. The company said it is “encouraged that both extensive clinical research and the new, permanent Category 1 CPT codes reinforce the value of the long-term continuous cardiac monitoring the Zio service provides.”


  CEO change


  Even while skeptics saw recent news of Chief Executive Officer Kevin King’s retirement in January as another sign that reimbursement updates could foil sales goals, Wall Street bulls have doubled down.


  The addition of former Medtronic Inc. executive Mike Coyle as CEO “signals confidence in the long-term potential of the company, and perhaps even near- term comfort around reimbursement rates heading into 2021,” wrote Truist analyst Kaila Krum.


  Eight analysts including Krum have a buy or equivalent recommendation on iRhythm, compared with three hold-equivalent ratings, data compiled by Bloomberg data.


  Oppenheimer’s Suraj Kalia, who rates iRhythm at market perform, saw King’s departure as “a total surprise” and wrote in a Dec. 14 note that “the timing is somewhat perplexing.” The shift in leadership “will cause ripple effects downstream” at the company with the fallout from potential reimbursement changes tough to grasp, Kalia wrote.

  “A major issue is that people are clueless as to whom they should approach on entering a police station. Often they are made to wait in the police station for hours together. Now the receptionist will listen to their problem and guide them to the right officer. For instance, if it is a theft, the complainant will be directed to the crime wing,” he said.


  ## No more waiting


  Mr. Sinha said one such reception centre opened due to the initiative taken by Inspector N. Selvi at Mathichiyam police station has proved to be a successful model. “The petitioner will get clarity on whom to approach for his problem. If a particular officer is not available, he will be guided to another officer or asked to come back at a particular time to meet the right officer. Thereby, the petitioner need not indefinitely wait at the police station and waste his time,” he said.


  Ms. Selvi said police personnel assigned to receive petitioners had been asked to show patience while listening to their problem. “A glass of water offered to a tense complainant can help him calm down and explain his problem lucidly,” she said.


  “Since the reception area has been set up on the portico, physical distancing is also being maintained,” she said, pointing to many police personnel in the city getting infected with COVID-19. The station also offers masks to people who come without one.


  The reception centre will function from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. The receptionist will wear a badge for easy identification and also help in drafting the petitions for unlettered people.

  Another important change could involve what employers offer in terms of mental health support, because people have been isolated in ways they never have been before during the pandemic.


  Stevens, the NDSU human resources professor, doesn't think companies will be legally required to expand those supports, but ethically and as a good business model, they likely would want to.


  “If employers want the best for their employees, they will want to do things to help them with their mental health,” he said.

 The Pan Am flight exploded over Lockerbie less than an hour after takeoff from London on Dec. 21, 1988, en route to New York City and then Detroit. Among the Americans on board were 35 Syracuse University students flying home for Christmas after a semester abroad.
 The attack was the latest flare of tension between Libya and Western nations, including the U.S. In the years before the flight, for instance, Libya was blamed for the bombing of a West Berlin discotheque that killed two American soldiers and injured dozens of others.
 It wasn’t until 2003 that Gadhafi and Libya accepted responsibility for the Pan Am disaster, with the country formally taking blame and reaching a $2.7 billion compensation deal with the victims’ families. Sanctions were lifted and, in 2006, the Bush administration removed Libya from its list of state sponsors of terrorism and restored diplomatic relations with the country.
 Besides Barr, another key figure in the Lockerbie investigation was Robert Mueller, who was the Justice Department’s criminal chief at the time the first set of charges was announced. Mueller would later become FBI director and special counsel in charge of the investigation into ties between Russia and the 2016 Trump campaign.

The EU's drug regulator authorised the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine on Monday, and said there was no evidence it would not work against a new strain found mainly in Britain.


  The European Medicines Agency said the "historic" step paved the way for vaccinations to finally start within days across the 27-nation EU where cases of the disease are surging.


  The Amsterdam-based regulator moved the decision forward from December 29 under pressure from EU governments, after Britain and the United States gave the green light weeks earlier.


  "It is a significant step forward in the fight against this pandemic that is causing suffering and hardship," EMA chief Emer Cooke told an online press conference as she announced the decision.


  "This is really a historic scientific achievement, within less than a year a vaccine will have been developed and authorised against this disease."


  The EMA approved a one-year "conditional marketing authorisation" for the vaccine developed by US giant Pfizer and German firm BioNTech, with the European Commission set to formally sign off on it within hours.


  "It’s a decisive moment in our efforts to deliver safe & effective vaccines to Europeans!" European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said on Twitter.


  "Now we will act fast. I expect a @EU_Commission decision by this evening."


  The EU has said it will start coordinated Covid-19 inoculations on December 27.

  The urgency surrounding the virus has increased with the news that a fast- spreading variant is sweeping Britain, prompting a growing number of countries worldwide to suspend flights from the UK.


  Cooke said it appeared the Pfizer-BioNTech jab would work against the new strain.


  "At this moment there is no evidence to suggest this vaccine will not work against the new variant," she added.


  The EMA has been under huge pressure to speed up the process with governments led by Germany asking why Britain and the United States were able to authorise the vaccine sooner.


  It said the delay was because a conditional marketing authorisation is more thorough and lasts longer than the emergency authorisation used by London and Washington.


  Cooke said the agency had "worked night and day" to speed things up, but needed to make sure the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was safe and effective, in order to avoid any doubts that could affect uptake.


  A decision on another vaccine produced by US firm Moderna is due by January 6.


  The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine has proven to be 95 percent effective in global trials where two doses are injected three weeks apart.


  It must be stored at -70 degrees Celsius (-94 degrees Fahrenheit), a temperature much lower than standard freezers and which forced the company to develop special containers for transport.


  The EMA has been carrying out a so-called "rolling review" on the vaccine involving lab tests and large-scale human trials over the past few months, speeding up a process that normally lasts years.


  The regulator can grant medicines a conditional marketing authorisation for the EU in public health emergencies. It then follows up with further tests to make sure there are no problems down the line.


  Meanwhile, the EMA has also had to contend with a cyberattack in which data from the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines was stolen.

Currently, one of the most significant factors that could cause actual outcomes to differ materially from the Company’s forward-looking statements is the adverse effect of COVID-19, including possible resurgences, on the Company’s business, financial performance and condition, operating results and cash flows, the real estate market and the hospitality industry specifically, and the global economy and financial markets generally. The significance, extent and duration of the impacts caused by the COVID-19 outbreak on the Company will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence at this time, including the scope, severity and duration of the pandemic, the extent and effectiveness of the actions taken to contain the pandemic or mitigate its impact, the potential for additional hotel closures/consolidations that may be mandated or advisable, whether based on increased COVID-19 cases or other factors, the slowing or potential rollback of “reopenings” in certain states, and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and containment measures, among others. Moreover, investors are cautioned to interpret many of the risks identified under the section titled “Risk Factors” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 as being heightened as a result of the ongoing and numerous adverse impacts of COVID-19. Such additional factors include, but are not limited to, the ability of the Company to effectively acquire and dispose of properties; the ability of the Company to successfully integrate pending transactions and implement its operating strategy; changes in general political, economic and competitive conditions and specific market conditions; reduced business and leisure travel due to travel-related health concerns, including the widespread outbreak of COVID-19 or an increase in COVID-19 cases or any other infectious or contagious diseases in the U.S. or abroad; adverse changes in the real estate and real estate capital markets; financing risks; litigation risks; regulatory proceedings or inquiries; and changes in laws or regulations or interpretations of current laws and regulations that impact the Company’s business, assets or classification as a REIT. Although the Company believes that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements contained herein are reasonable, any of the assumptions could be inaccurate, and therefore there can be no assurance that such statements included in this press release will prove to be accurate. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by the Company or any other person that the results or conditions described in such statements or the objectives and plans of the Company will be achieved. In addition, the Company’s qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. Readers should carefully review the risk factors described in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including but not limited to those discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2020. Any forward- looking statement that the Company makes speaks only as of the date of this press release.

“But above all there has been a lot more encouragement. You have to fight against this opposition in order to improve something. We have to make it clear to people that we live in a democracy that can’t be destroyed by anything or anyone. Hate comments tend to make me position myself even more clearly,” Goretzka said.
 In March, Goretzka and Bayern teammate Joshua Kimmich launched their “We Kick Corona” fundraising campaign to help social and charitable organizations continue their work through the pandemic. They donated 1 million euros ($1.2 million) and encouraged others to contribute more than 5 million euros ($6.1 million) in total.
 In August, the fund contributed 75,000 euros ($92,000) to the Auschwitz- Birkenau concentration and extermination camp memorial in Poland. The funds facilitated an exhibition on athletes deported to Auschwitz and an international conference on remembrance, education and dealing with wrongdoing incorporating racism and intolerance today.
 Goretzka said at the time that it's "a matter close to our hearts to help ensure that the culture of remembrance is upheld even in the corona pandemic.”
 Goretzka had already visited the Dachau concentration camp memorial near Munich in February, posting pictures on social media with the hashtags “NieWider” (never again), and “NeverForget.”
 Last month, Goretzka met 99-year-old Holocaust survivor Margot Friedländer in Berlin. Friedländer is the author of a book entitled “Versuche, dein Leben zu machen” (Try to Make Your Life) based on her experiences as a child, when she was arrested while on the run in Berlin and brought to the Theresienstadt concentration camp in what is now the Czech Republic.

Il pari contro il Verona non è piaciuto a tutti. Prandelli ribadisce. "Ho visto determinazione ed una mentalità corretta. Serve una mentalità da provinciale per arrivare a 40 punti, nessuno ci regalerà nulla. Ed anche la critica deve ragionare nell'ottica di una squadra che deve salvarsi. Questa è la nostra realtà, ho già detto che ora non è tempo di calcio spettacolo. Non abbiamo una grande filosofia di palleggio, ma di duelli individuali che vanno vinti. Poi le occasioni arriveranno. Creiamo poco? Si ma ora concediamo anche poco. Ho dovuto incidere molto sul concetto del riconquistare palla, quando le squadre partono per altri obiettivi è difficile calarsi in una nuova realtà, ma questo approccio ci servirà anche per il futuro".

'Tera Naam' and 'Mujhe Kuch Kehna Hai' fame actor Gopal Datt has done a lot of memorable comic roles so far, and it took him nearly two decades to come of that genre. The felicitous change happened with the Emmy Award-winning OTT series 'Delhi Crime' where he played the role of a cop. Currently shooting in Lucknow, the actor said, "Unfortunately, there is a 'bhed-chaal' (herd mentality) in the industry that you get roles only in the genre that give you popularity. You are not offered work of your choice. 'Delhi Crime' changed that perception. Working with Richie Mehta (director), it has been one of my finest works and experiences so far."He had been doing varied roles in the theatre but he was not getting that opportunity in films and TV. "That is why theatre is considered a lab where we can experiment. Earlier, the roles I was getting were on similar lines as everyone wants to play safe. To run your house and deposit EMI's we need to work so cannot deny work and roles in the long run. As an actor, you do not have many options and have to choose from what you are offered," Gopal said.The actor is now in a happy space. "Thankfully, like theatre, on OTT too, people have started experimenting, which is benefitting actors like us who were seen in a particular image. I am making an extra effort to explore different genres, and I am getting interesting roles too. Now, the spectrum is widening!"His versatile act in 'A Simple Murder' was hugely appreciated, describing which he said, "I will give credit to my director Sachin Pathak's vision. There is a very thin line when comedy can do wrong, especially when you are playing a cop. I am glad that it all came out well, and the audience appreciated it. In this (current) series, Sachin has carved another interesting role for me." His next work is set in his hometown Nainital. On coming to Lucknow once again, he said, "I have been regular to the city for work. I did a cameo here in 'Jabaria Jodi'. Besides, I have done a couple of stage performances, including Repertwahr Festival and attended Sanatkada Festival twice. Since I have landed here, my diet has gone for a toss, and I am just relishing tasty Awadhi cuisines."

With the world’s Great Powers (the U.S., Russia and China), and emerging Great Power, India, all having vested interests in space and the Moon, the construction of a nuclear plant on the celestial body is a major challenge as it will propel a race for its resources and weaponization. All countries will try and claim parts of the moon for mining, resembling something akin to Western Europe’s Scramble for Africa or the race to claim large swathes of Antarctica. The U.S. is trying to dominate space policies from a very narrow U.S.-centric view when space should be viewed as a Common Heritage to Mankind. Russia, China and India could also claim large swathes of the moon in reaction to U.S. unilateral activities, thus kicking off another, more fundamental “Scramble for the Moon.”
