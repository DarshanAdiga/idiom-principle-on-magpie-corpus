These days, future retirees need to be a little more aggressive in their planning. If you retire at 65, that could still result in a 20-year to 30-year retirement period that requires a lot of money to sustain. The good news is that in the long term, equities and markets generally appreciate. For instance, the S&P 500 Index has an average annual return of roughly 8% between 1957 and 2018. So, you want a portfolio based on industries that will still be around and relevant in the future, as well as industries that can grow.

GAUHATI, India (AP) — Authorities in India’s northeastern state of Nagaland have banned the sale of dog meat and halted the import and trading of dogs to be used for food, officials said Saturday.


  The remote Christian-majority state’s Chief Secretary Temjen Toy said in a tweet that the state government banned all commercial import and trading of dogs and also the sale of dog meat, both cooked and uncooked. The move followed an appeal earlier in the week by Indian lawmaker Maneka Gandhi, who urged the Nagaland government to act.


  Gandhi’s appeal came after she received fresh photographs of the trade from a Nagaland-based animal protection group. The appeal led to more than 125,000 people writing to the Nagaland government to urge the banning of the dog trade and the sale of dog meat.


  “This is a major turning point in ending the cruelty in India’s hidden dog meat trade,” animal rights advocacy group Humane Society International said in a statement.


  The group estimates that up to 30,000 dogs a year are smuggled into Nagaland, where they are sold in live markets. The group also says dogs are regularly beaten to death with wooden clubs.


  Authorities praised the movement.


  “This is a progressive move. In this day and age, positive social media activism and advocacy has an enormous impact on policymakers. Congrats and thanks to all,” Abu Metha, an adviser to Nagaland Chief Minister Neiphiu Rio, the state’s highest elected official, said in a tweet.


  Apart from Nagaland, thousands of dogs each year are illegally captured for consumption from the streets or stolen from homes in other northeast Indian states, including Mizoram, Tripura and Arunachal Pradesh, rights groups say.

LONDON (AP) — The pints are being poured and the unkempt hairdos are being cut and styled as England embarks Saturday on its biggest lockdown easing yet.


  In addition to the reopening of much of the hospitality sector, including pubs and restaurants, for the first time in more than three months, couples can tie the knot once again and people can go and see a movie at the cinema.


  Museums and libraries have also reopened but gyms, swimming pools and nail bars remain shut. Restrictions on travel and social contact have been eased — people from different households can now go into each other's homes, for example.


  And many of those despairing at what they see in the mirror can finally get their hair trimmed. In all cases, social distancing rules have to be followed.


  “It was getting frustrating that I couldn’t get my hair cut," said William Brown, a 25-year-old plant engineer at Headley’s Barber Shop in Blaby, central England.


  "It was doing my head in to be honest, I’m just glad it’s gone now,” he added.

“If a club has the finances to pay for a transfer, they will do it,” he told _ESPN_. "The clubs have to be run properly. Every business in the world has to be run properly. Nobody forces anyone and says 'you must have a big transfer.' You've got to look at it generally, and you can't compare apples and oranges. Some clubs can, some clubs can't. What is most important is that every club is run properly."

Stephanie Headley, the 35-year-old owner, was equally relieved to be back in business for the fist time since the full lockdown was announced on March 23.


  Headley said she was a “little bit anxious" and that she has been inundated with booking appointments after Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirmed the latest easing of the lockdown last week.


  "I can’t wait to see all the dodgy haircuts that have come out of quarantine,” she said.


  Though the easing of the lockdown will be warmly welcomed by many, there are concerns that the British government is being overly hasty, even reckless, in sanctioning the changes, given the country's still-high coronavirus infection and death rates. In other countries, the reopening of bars and restaurants has been blamed for a spike in infections.


  On Friday, another 137 virus-related deaths were recorded across the U.K., the large majority in England, taking the total to 44,131, by far the highest in Europe and third behind the United States and Brazil.


  Johnson says the decision to ease the lockdown is based on the scientific evidence that people are “appreciably less likely now to be in close proximity” with someone with the virus than at the height of the pandemic.

In the town of Fraga, where fruit processing plants dot the surrounding farmland of lush orchards, 360 infections over the past two weeks have forced authorities to bring back the first localized restrictions since the country left behind a strict lockdown of nearly three months.


  The nearby county around Lleida, population 200,000, has been the latest to go into lockdown, the Catalan regional authorities announced on Saturday, after infections in the province doubled in a week, from 167 to 325. As admissions to hospitals and ICUs are worryingly on the rise again, an inflatable emergency ward has been installed at the gates of a local hospital.


  Any uptick is being scrutinized in a country on edge after losing at least 28,300 people to COVID-19, according to official records.


  At the peak of the outbreak, back in April, fearing that a shortage of workers would leave fruit rotting in the trees, agricultural unions and business associations advertised jobs that have attracted many more applicants than expected. Hail has also destroyed crops in some counties, creating what Lleida Deputy Mayor Sandra Castro calls the “perfect storm” for a “social crisis on top of the ongoing health crisis.”


  Two vast trade exhibition halls have been filled with temporary, equidistant beds for more than 200 workers. Temperatures are measured on arrival, those who show symptoms of COVID-19 are tested and positives go into quarantine facilities.


  But Castro said her government can only do so much, especially regarding migrants with no permission to work who, according to the city’s estimate, make up more than half of those who showed up despite travel restrictions.

If you're planning for retirement a ways down the road, you want to fill your portfolio with stocks that will grow your savings in the long term. ESG stocks and funds fit this requirement because issues like climate change will not be solved overnight. Not only are many of these stocks in imperative industries, but also in what are expected to be fast-growing industries. A balanced selection of more established companies dedicated to improving ESG issues and those with more direct involvement in ESG should bode well for your portfolio.

When positioning your retirement fund for the long-term horizon, perhaps three or four decades down the road, be sure to save room in your portfolio for environmental, social, and governance (ESG) stocks. Sure, these companies may involve novel strategies and may not be as well tested as other industries, but they are based on growing trends that are becoming more mainstream with each passing day. Taking a long approach based on companies that will drive the way the world is changing is a winning strategy in my opinion.

In den 90er-Jahren war George Clooney zunächst einmal aus der Krankenhausserie "Emergency Room" bekannt, ehe er auch auf der großen Leinwand so richtig durchstartete – und "Out of Sight" trug maßgeblich dazu bei. In der kultigen Krimikomödie entführt er als Bankräuber Jennifer Lopez, die damals ebenfalls durch den Film sehr viel mehr Aufmerksamkeit bekam.
