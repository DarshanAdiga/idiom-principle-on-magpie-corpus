Mitten Squad sides with Yes Man, because it’s the quickest way to clear the game. But by the time he arrived at Hoover Dam, the final level in _New Vegas_ _,_ his thirst was in the red. Here Mitten Squad learned that thirst apparently gets exponentially worse, rather than increasing by a set amount. By the time he neared Caesar at the end, he had 962 points in dehydration, meaning that he was a few moments away from dying. But, he still managed to talk his way through the final encounter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           *[FT]: Financial Times

The telling point was that his team-mates realised how good he was and they constantly passed him the ball. That’s how you know how good he is.

I don't like to use the word "squandered," that's a big word. But we probably haven't optimized how we used that time. Now what we've done is, we've gained time again by putting in place these big shutdowns. All they do is they buy time, they don't actually stop the virus, they suppress it, they slow it. What you want to do now is use that time well to get the testing in place, to get the systems in place, so that you can actually manage the individual level cases that are going to be fundamental to stopping this.

However, the debate was moved to the country’s capital by the Democratic National Committee in light of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       *[FT]: Financial Times

There are three camera lenses on the back of the Oppo Find X2 Pro. Notably, it has the exclusive-to-Oppo Sony IMX689, which has a 1/1.4” sensor and 48-megapixels. It’s joined by a second 48-megapixel sensor and a 13-megapixel periscope zoom camera. Oppo makes the bold claim that it’s as “advanced as an entry-level DSLR camera,” and though it is certainly packed full of different modes, I wouldn’t go that far. Most are non-creatively named with the “Ultra” prefix. We have Ultra Night Mode 3.0, Ultra Wide Mode, Ultra Dark Mode, Ultra Macro Mode, and even Ultra Steady Mode.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      *[FT]: Financial Times

Referring to Russian-US relations, Fomin recalled that Washington had labelled Russia its chief geostrategic rival and a threat to America's global dominance. "At the same time, I believe that the current military and political situation edges Russia and the United States towards communicating more often, and that also implies communication between their militaries. We are ready to discuss pressing international security problems with the Americans," he pointed out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      *[FT]: Financial Times

The Trailblazer Group is working hard to make its membership as relevant and inclusive as possible and they have reached out to the current Training Providers, End Point Assessment Organisations, as well as the current Professional Bodies to ensure that decisions on content and wording take on board "real world" and "real-time" outcomes being experienced in the market place currently. All groups are very mindful that the review provides an opportunity to resolve both policy and technical issues as well as head off delivery problems that become evident as standards move through their lifecycle. The Institute is supporting this approach by engaging with a number of current providers delivering the apprenticeship and advising the Trailblazer on policy and process. We have already run a virtual workshop with the Trailblazer to develop a first draft of the revised standard and, as part of the ongoing development process, the Trailblazer will consult stakeholders beyond its membership on the draft wording of the revised standard. This is of course subject to the exceptional circumstances presented by Coronavirus and we realise that organisations will have a great many other priorities at this time. However, our intention at present is to have a revised standard and EPA plan ready for submission into the Institute's Cycle 29 Approvals process, the deadline for which is 20 May.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      *[FT]: Financial Times

Not discounting the seriousness of the current pandemic, it may actually afford some opportunities for positive reactions.


   


  If you find yourself quarantined at home with your family, one diversion you might try is something called conversation. Older folks might remember it as a time when people gathered and discussed (not argued) about the weather, current events, what produced best in the garden last year, and many other non-combative subjects. It was a pleasant, relaxing exercise sometimes accompanied by tea and cookies.


   


  Nowadays you'd have to ban electronics or it would be difficult to hold people's interest.


   


  And how about those antiquated things called books? When was the last time you actually read a book?


   


  While I can't recommend a lot of the current fiction offerings (if I see the words "erotic" or "serial killings" on the flyleaf, the book is quickly returned to the shelf), there are wonderful nonfiction writings about nature, the history of the world, the future of space exploration, and many others. A comfy chair, a good lamp, and a stool on which to prop your feet are all you need to lose yourself (and all the worries of the day) in a good book.


   


  Involve the whole family. Drag out those old board games from the closet shelf, fix some snacks, and have a friendly competition with Scrabble or Pictionary. Rediscover what it means to be a family, get to know each other again.


   


  I'll bet you've missed out on a lot amid all the frantic hustle and bustle of daily life. Like writing letters. A distant elder relative, a grandparent or great aunt, or maybe an old friend from school would be thrilled to receive a note from you, something actually handwritten on paper and sent through the mail.


   


  E-cards and texts and Facebook will never brighten days or bring tears to eyes like receiving actual mail and recognizing the handwriting of a loved one.


   


  The current Maker Movement should give you some ideas too. Poke around in those catch-all junk drawers and investigate some of those boxes up on the shelf. You're bound to come across something that will spark your imagination. Maybe the first spark in a long time.


   


  Most of you may not remember the great polio scare of years past. Our town swimming pool was closed that summer and people were terrified of "catching it." But staying home wasn't such a big deal.


   


  We weren't yet addicted to smart phones and tablets and sporting events and concerts. We were pretty much used to playing make-believe games in the yard, reading comic books, helping in the family garden or riding our bikes around and around the block, trying to learn to ride with no hands.


   


  Hours were spent learning to do cartwheels, playing hopscotch or hide-and- seek, or some other games made up on the spur of the moment using whatever we had available. If you were lucky enough to have a grandma and grandpa available in your home, you got to hear stories about "the good old days" and were taught to embroider or crochet doilies.


   


  When I reached 7th grade and was taught "Homemaking," I was the class star because one of the requirements was crocheting a doily and my grandma already had taught me that skill several years prior. I remember she just beamed with pride when I brought home my certificate with the big gold star.


   


  So, if you are staying home because of the current pandemic, why not take advantage of the opportunity to re-introduce yourself to your family. You might just learn something new about them.

The coronavirus outbreak in India so far has claimed seven deaths and the number of cases has risen to 415. Speaking to CNBC-TV18, the former deputy chairman of the Planning Commission, Montek Singh Ahluwalia emphasised that there was an urgent need to ramp up the country's social welfare schemes.Ahluwalia said that the biggest priority should be to deal with the health side of the crisis. However, on the fiscal side, he said, &quot;We should not be worried too much about what that (increased expenditure) might do to the fiscal deficit because quite honestly the fiscal deficit is going to be seriously de-stabilised because of the expected collapse in growth all over the world which will also happen in India. So, revenues are going to be low anyway.&amp;rdquo;According to Ahluwalia, the central government must announce some programmes and fund the states. &amp;ldquo;An aspect that you have to keep in mind here is that the expenditure has to be done by the state governments. It is going to be an expenditure in hospitals run by state government, so probably the central government will have to introduce some new centrally sponsored scheme which is fast disbursing where state governments can get on with doing what is needed, maybe even get some guidance from the national teams that are working out the health strategy,&amp;rdquo; he said.Ahluwalia further added that there is a need to expand the existing social welfare schemes. &amp;ldquo;A lot of businesses are going to be badly hurt and that is likely to lead to layoffs especially in the informal sector. So, we need to expand the existing social welfare schemes as much as we can. Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) is one of them and we should be willing to ramp it up so that it can provide fill-in for some of the loss of employment that may be taking place elsewhere,&amp;rdquo; he said.There is also a need to moderate the debt burden on small businesses, said Ahluwalia. &amp;ldquo;Many businesses will run into difficulty, especially in the sectors that are very severely affected &amp;ndash; airlines, transport, tourism, hotels. So, I think some measures will have to be taken to moderate the debt burden that these businesses have which would otherwise simply lead to bankruptcy and collapse.&amp;rdquo;&amp;ldquo;Normally you would not rush in to save anyone business because it is having difficulty, but this is not a problem of one unit, this is across the board, system problem. So, I think the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) needs to step in and do what is necessary to maybe relax some regulatory norms,&amp;rdquo; he added.

Now, “closed temporarily” signs are being replaced by “for lease” signs. Lam, who worked for years in the restaurant supply business, said he knew of more than a dozen Chinese restaurants that had already closed. He had to send most of his employees home, and he and two other co-owners of the restaurant are working the kitchen themselves to field the rare takeout order. His friends are asking one another whether they should buy a gun.


  The most stressful part is not knowing what the government will do next, Lam said.


  “If they order us to shut down, there’s nothing we can do,” Lam said. “I can’t even tell you how long we will last.”


  At the end of the day, I called my mother, who works at a hospital in Northern California. I asked her to stay home, but her boss told her if she didn’t show up, she would lose her job. At work, patients sometimes refuse to be seen by her, because suddenly an Asian woman in a face mask is a threat.


  On Friday, I talked to Khinn Muy Ung, 52, who worked as a dealer at Hollywood Park Casino until March 14, when widespread quarantine measures were announced and she lost her job. She’s not sure if she’ll have work when the restrictions lift.


  On top of that, she lives in a building in Chinatown where for the last year landlords have been trying to evict a population of low-income seniors, mostly of Southeast Asian descent.


  Volunteers from the Chinatown Community for Equitable Development organized the tenants to protest at the landlord’s multimillion-dollar home in Brentwood last October. The landlord sold the property, but the new landlord was no different.


  And so in February, as officials announced the first confirmed cases of coronavirus in California, she received another 60-day notice to move out.

On Tuesday, I reached out to Kristin Fukushima, managing director of the Little Tokyo Community Council.


  In Little Tokyo, she said, the widespread move to working remotely has eliminated the weekday lunch crowd that many businesses rely on. The council is trying to organize donations and deliveries of food, toilet paper and other materials to seniors in Little Tokyo Towers, Miyako Gardens and several other facilities. Other volunteers are translating emergency information into Japanese and Korean and compiling a list of resources for small businesses as well as ways for people to support them.


  When I see Fukushima and others working around the clock, leading Zoom calls with dozens of volunteers and sending emails at 3 a.m., I’m reminded that ethnic communities in Los Angeles have always relied on a human safety net made of people like Fukushima, Toy and Cheung. That human safety net needs your support more than ever right now.


  On Wednesday, a few hours after President Trump insisted on labeling the virus a Chinese virus in a news conference, I spoke with Jack Lee, whose son attends the fourth grade at a mostly white elementary school in Orange County.


  During a basketball game, two classmates accused his son of having the coronavirus. Lee’s son said a curse word in response, and of the three children, he was punished by school authorities most harshly.


  Lee was angry. He wrote a long letter to the principal. He made sure to tell his son that it was OK to defend himself. He’s never had to talk with his son about race before. His own parents, immigrants from Taiwan, never had to talk to him about it either. But now he’s looking for the right words, Lee said.


  “I think there are some deeper conversations we’re going to need to have,” Lee said.


  On Thursday, I spoke with Andy Lam, part-owner of Alice’s Kitchen, a popular Hong Kong restaurant in Monterey Park. Asian neighborhoods like those in the San Gabriel Valley have been experiencing slowdowns for several weeks already because media reports and public comments about the virus have repeatedly associated the coronavirus with Asian culture, food and identity.

  "I am very pleased with how it turned out because I really wasn’t expecting it to actually be any good!” she says.


  "I think it is the perfect thing to have at home because it really does keep my little boy occupied which is especially important for times like this when you do need to spend more time at home.

Minister Anroux Marais said, "These decisions were not taken lightly and affect us all, but in the best interest of all those we serve had to be implemented to encourage social distancing to reduce the risk of spreading the virus. History has shown time and again: through the many struggles nations and humanity as a whole have experienced together, the arts, sport, recreation and cultural affairs have been the shared reprieve restoring hope, and inspirational motivation to move towards our common goals to overcome hardships together. We are fully aware of the increasing concerns that exist but as the Western Cape Government, we are working around the clock on developing and updating as many FAQs as possible and our priority is to keep you informed with verified information. Finally, we encourage people to stay healthy, fit and to utilize outside spaces to continue exercising and where possible to rather engage our department via email or telephonically to reduce physical contact at the Protea Assurance Head Office building. Let's work together to stop the spread".

A total ankle will replace the cartilage on these two surfaces with a metal on polyethylene “bearing” surface that are firmly attached to the bone. Motion between these two joint surfaces is what allows the up and down movement of the foot. When an ankle joint replacement is preformed it will only resurface the ankle joint itself and would not be expected to help arthritis pain that is coming from joints of the foot.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          *[FT]: Financial Times

A Derry couple who had to call off their wedding just three weeks before their 'big day' because of the coronavirus shutdown have vowed to stay positive.   Orla Mullan and Keith Lynch, who are both actors, met during the 2013 City of Culture celebrations in Derry.   Local audiences will know them from pantomine at the Millennium Forum, where Keith has played the baddie to Orla's goodie on a number of occasions.   The couple had been gearing up for their wedding In Downings in Donegal for the last 18 months.   But last Friday, just 48 hours after Orla's final dress fitting, they came to the heartbreaking decision that it would have to be cancelled.   "We couldn’t believe it," she said.   "I think a state of shock took over those first couple of days and of course, there were a lot of tears - it just felt like such a blow so close to the date.   "But we knew that it was absolutely the right decision.   "It was almost taken out of our hands - it was totally clear that it simply was not an option to go ahead. We weren’t willing to risk the health and safety of our family and guests."   The couple had invited a lot of guests from England and were worried about how safe it would be for them to travel.   "The majority of my bridal party which includes my sister and nieces were coming from England, one groomsman was coming from England, another was on lockdown in Spain and one of my best friends wasn’t able to fly in from the USA."   Orla, who will be starring as DS Roz McFarland in the upcoming season 3 of ‘Marcella’ on ITV, said it was the right decision to postpone their wedding.   "It just wouldn’t have been the day we had planned and we knew there wouldn’t be the same joy in a compromised version of the wedding we had hoped for.   "We had high numbers so we didn’t even consider cutting it down to under 100 people.   "We both agreed that when we were going to do it, we would do it right and as we imagined."   The couple have been making efforts to reschedule, but with uncertain times ahead due to the coronavirus it has proved  difficult.   "Sadly, it’s looking like it may be another year now until we make it official," said Orla.   "But we have to keep perspective and are very aware of how lucky we are - we have each other and that’s what’s most important.   "Our main thank you has to go to our amazing parents, siblings, extended family and friends whose support has been amazing.   "When the big day finally comes, we know it will be all the more special."   The couple have had to suffer a double whammy, with all their bookings as singers and actors cancelled for the foreseeable future.    "What has been especially tough is, almost immediately, it went from being a personal devastation, to a professional one too," explained Orla.   "We are both self-employed performers and almost all of our work until September has been completely cancelled.   "The stress this has added on an already upsetting situation has been proving really tough.   "So many of our friends and colleagues have lost all their work too and across the board the arts have been hit very hard.   "It is going to be very difficult to come back from it for arts organisations and freelancers - we are a resilient community but it is financially very worrying and a testing time to keep ourselves mentally healthy when these continuous cancellations make the future look very bleak and with the very limited support options available for the self-employed."   Orla is also part of a swing music trio, The Swingtime Starlets, who have performed at the likes of the Jazz Festival, Bishop’s Gate Hotel, the Halloween celebrations and the Walled City Tattoo.   "We were working up to what would have been the busiest week we had ever booked with VE Day 75 coming up in May, among many other booked gigs, and they have sadly almost all be cancelled.   "Each day more and more cancellations come in, it is really soul destroying.   "We can only hope that when this difficult time passes, we will be able to come back stronger.   "As long as we stick together and try and stay positive, we just have to ride it out and hope for brighter days ahead.   "The effect it has had on life as we know it, across the world, is devastating and has left us certainly feel like we are living in a bad dream that we aren’t waking up from.”

"I just started to gather little things from the cupboards like switches, door stoppers, door handles and so on that I already had and could potentially use.


  "Then I added my little boy's xylophone because he loves it.


  "I also thought about how he loves cars and buses and knew it would be a good idea to use a car or bus shape. Then I just searched for lots of random things on ebay to see what came up and if anything could be used.


  "I used spare wood that my mum and dad already had in their garden. I only really had to buy the paint, lights and the tie, zip and button boards. It cost me about £20 for those things.”


  Once Taylor decided on the look of the busy board, she got started with the DIY process.

In that game, 2 legitimate goals were disallowed (one for offside and another for the ball crossing the byline just before it was crossed in), and even my 9 year old self could see something wasn’t quite right here. The referee, Egyptian Gamal Al-Ghandour, and his linesmen were to blame and interestingly, I do believe that was the ref’s last ever match. Suspicious to say the least. My memory fails me and that game was nearly 18 years ago now(!!) , but reading a report of the game also mentions that the Spanish forwards were “caught offside” multiple times.

While architecture has a sizable cohort of sole traders for whom working at home is old hat, many have been thrown into this with no warning. It’s action learning.

The new measures, which include urging people to work from home, still fall short of the tougher lockdowns imposed by neighbours amid concerns among some experts that the archipelago of 260 million people is not doing enough to contain the virus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          National police spokesman Muhammad Iqbal said 465,000 police across Indonesia would disperse any public gatherings "for the sake of public safety" though a photograph posted on social media of a packed commuter train in Jakarta quickly went viral.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          President Joko Widodo on Monday offered his condolences after a medical association said six doctors and nurses had died after contracting the virus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          "I would like to thank them for their hard work, for their dedication in dealing with COVID-19," said Widodo, speaking at the opening of an emergency hospital on the site of the “Athlete’s Village” built for the 2018 Asian Games in Jakarta.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Indonesia has confirmed 514 cases of the virus and 48 deaths, mainly concentrated in Jakarta, whose governor on Friday admitted medical staff were already getting over-stretched.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Widodo said doctors and other medical staff would receive bonuses ranging from 5 million rupiah to 15 million rupiah ($300-$900) per month in regions that have declared an emergency. Aside from Jakarta, the East Java region has also declared an emergency.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           The president has so far resisted calls for tougher lockdowns due to concerns about the impact on businesses and the poor, many of whom are vendors plying their trade on the streets.

But Rocky Margiano Simanjuntak, 23, posted a photograph on social media from inside a packed early morning train on his way to work in the city at a bank.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          "Government policies seem to be only half measures, just an appeal," Simanjuntak told Reuters via a message on his Instagram account, adding that public transport should not be limited unless authorities enforced rules to make people stay at home.

The Nigerian has hit the ground running in his loan move to Old Trafford, hitting four goals in four starts.


  And keeping him for two seasons would increase the club’s chances of landing their former target during that time.


  Another forward being linked to the club is Tottenham star Harry Kane– but this could have a bad knock-on effect for Solskjaer.

In theory, that means you’ll be able to pick up a compatible drive off the shelf and use that as an expansion drive for the PlayStation 5, but in practice, it might be a little while after launch before you can do that. As Digital Foundry explains, to get the most out of an PS5 expansion drive, you’ll want to get a PCIe 4.0-based drive, which will be rare and expensive when the PS5 hits shelves. Cerny also noted in his presentation today that Sony will be validating drives that are compatible with the PlayStation 5, so wait on Sony for more information before you rush out to buy more storage.                                                                                                        *[FT]: Financial Times

Lustgarten says there’s still some stigma around seeking help in the first place. “The concern from co-founders is what other people would think about them needing to work on their relationship,” he says. “If people think the relationship isn’t good, it’ll impact the business and their ability to get funding. And if you can’t get funding, you’re dead in the water.”

McConnell said, "The notion that we have time to play games here with the American economy and the American people is utterly absurd. The American people expect us to act tomorrow, and I want everybody to fully understand if we aren't able to act tomorrow it will be because of our colleagues on the other side continuing to dicker when the country expects us to come together."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             *[FT]: Financial Times

Seven-time NASCAR champion Johnson, who has been practicing sports car and IndyCar racing on the simulator in his garage, competed from a rig that appeared more suited for one of those cars than his virtual No. 48 Chevrolet. But Johnson proved to be a less-than-elite iRacer early with a comical crash in which his car appeared to be a ping-pong ball off the wall and several other cars.


  “I hope everyone enjoyed that today. I clearly have a ton to learn,” Johnson said.


  Among those hit by Johnson was Alex Bowman, Johnson's teammate at Hendrick Motorsports and one of the highly rated computer racers. But drivers can hit a reset to “fix” the damage and continue.

The US Federal Reserve has bought $272 billion of government debt last week, of the more than $500 billion authorized. According to Bullard, this should not be seen as a limit. _"This is unlimited and we can go much higher if necessary. We are trying to provide as much support as we can to that market."_


  He explained that the goal right now should be to support American workers and businesses across the board, rather than picking individual companies or industries, such as the airline industry or hotels. He stressed that the country shouldn't lose companies or industries because of lack of support.


  Talking about small business lending, the official said that the Fed would need to set up a _"brand new program,"_ which would be time consuming so it would make more sense to use existing small business lending programs, or to have Congress guarantee bank loans.

The Galaxy Watch Active 2 is sporty, sleek, and decorated with a four-star rating in our review. You’ll have no problem wearing it every day be it the boardroom or the gym. Regardless of your wrist size, its circular case is nicely proportioned and attached to breathable silicone straps, that are interchangeable when you want to switch up your style. The Active 2 also flaunts a 1.2-inch Super AMOLED display in a 40-millimeter case that is anything but disappointing. Complemented by a 360 x 360-pixel resolution, you’re in store for a comfortable viewing experience in any light. And with an IP68 rating to boot, its military-grade durability won’t falter with dust or water, even when submerged to 5 ATM.

Things improved when he moved to Real Madrid in 2002 but, in truth, while some of his performances were fantastic, his total of 104 goals in 177 games across five seasons reflects the debilitating effect those three injury-ravaged years had on him. He went to AC Milan for a couple of years but his body wouldn’t work the way it once did and injuries limited his appearances. He wound up back in Brazil at Corinthians for a last hurrah before calling it a day with 19 trophies won and an incredible 67 personal awards.

Honda and Subaru, for example, have told _The Verge_ that they have contingencies in place for production disruptions and full factory shutdowns.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           *[FT]: Financial Times

“Not in my backyard,” — the rallying cry for all those people across America trying to stop the latest pipeline, fracking operation, water contamination project, cutting of a valuable forest, or any one of the myriad actions being taken lately to horribly transform the environment.                                                                                                                                                                                                  For far too many of us, shouting “NIMBY,” is too much like screaming “you can’t take my child” as she is being transported away after a kidnapping. We seem to arrive minutes too late and with the wrong tools.                                                                                                                                                                                                  This is my first column after returning from 9 months in Tucson, AZ, where I tried to keep tabs on the constant unsuccessful attempts at building a wall sufficiently large and foreboding enough to keep brown-skinned people at bay. I watched with many of you as parts of the wall were built and then blew over in a “big wind.” I watched as big business tried unsuccessfully to limit the range of Mexican Grey Wolves and Cougars in order to make a killing on taxpayer land with the permission of President Donald Trump’s administration. I drove to the border repeatedly to look at the monstrosity that cuts through the center of Nogales effectively separating the haves from the have-nots. I drove along that southern border in sight of the wall — paying close attention to the scrub desert habitat that was home to so much wildlife that depended on resources on both sides of the border to survive. No amount of “NIMBY” thought and action has done much to keep this terrible, racist eyesore from sliding across our southern border, our southern backyard.                                                                                                                                                                                                  In years past, I often wondered why it was your backyard that was too important to be polluted or to be dug up or to be fouled in some unspeakable way. After all, I didn’t own or have access to that piece of real estate; it literally was not “in my backyard.” For that reason, I told myself it was not my problem, it was yours, or whoever stood to be affected the most. If the pipeline weren’t running through my farm, fouling my stream, leaking into my water supply, then it was bad — but, not my problem. It soon became apparent to me that this was a problem so big it affected every living creature on the planet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      *[FT]: Financial Times

Just a quick one on the Arsenal whining regarding that game, Rooney dived, where did you expect him to go when Campbell sticks out his leg? Arsenal players never dive though do they? cough cough. As to the rough house tactics, wrong I know but after the way Ruud was treated by your lot previously then you haven’t got a leg to stand on. As for shocking ref games what about the PSG let’s let Barca win no matter what game? Two dodgy penalties, ghost free kicks and general shit decisions, as a United fan though the Galatasaray game where Eric was punched by a copper sticks in the mind, cheating, diving, faining injury and the ref did the sum total of bugger all.

In light of the national shortage of one-use personal protective equipment (PPE), Nebraska Medicine has developed a safe and effective method to decontaminate these items so they can be used multiple times, instead of just once. A team led by John Lowe, Ph.D., University of Nebraska Medical Center assistant vice chancellor for inter-professional health security training and education, is using ultraviolet light towers to irradiate high numbers of masks, which were originally designed to only be used once. The strategy will allow Nebraska Medicine to greatly extend its supply of these items during the coronavirus pandemic.                                                                                                                                                                                                "The shortage of PPE is a nationwide issue - each and every one of these items is increasingly precious," said Mark Rupp, M.D., chief of the infectious diseases division at UNMC. "Although we were well prepared, our supplies were beginning to dwindle. We had to find a way to keep our providers and patients safe, and this will definitely help us achieve that goal."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          *[FT]: Financial Times

What are the best games for kids and family on PS4? When most people talk about PlayStation 4, they're thinking about its (brilliant) range of games aimed at an older audience. However, what's somewhat underplayed is the console's extensive variety of games for children and families. There are just as many games for youngsters as there are for adults, and many of them are enjoyable regardless of age. Whether they're easy to play games for kids or titles that allow children and parents to play together, PS4 is an untapped family friendly treasure trove. Here's what we believe to be 25 of the best PS4 kids games on Sony's console.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          *[FT]: Financial Times

In many ways, the journalistic feeding frenzy around the launch of the Lost City, back in the early 1990s, was reminiscent of the coronavirus, with the invitations from Sun International spreading virally around newsrooms. Few were immune. Travel and entertainment writers and editors – that was expected. Business reporters and editors (also understandable).

We’ve been waiting for Apple to make a new version of its wildly sucessful (and well priced) iPhone SE for years, and 2020 is looking like its year. We heard earlier this month it had entered the final stages before launch, and while we don’t know what price an iPhone SE 2 Plus/iPhone 9 Plus might be sold at, rumors say the 4.7-inch version will start from $400. Apple has kept the potential naming scheme for the new phones close to its chest, with both “iPhone SE 2” and “iPhone 9” in the running for consideration. To us, “iPhone 9” seems too inconsistent with Apple’s currently numbering system, but it wouldn’t be the first time the Cupertino, California company has defied expectations. We’ll let you know more as we hear more.

The growth of the smart manufacturing market is likely to be propelled by the high demand from the end-use segment of defense and aerospace. These sectors are responsible for generating high demand for quality controlled and customized equipment. According to a study led by Capgemini, as of March 2017, 62% of aerospace and defense enterprises had adopted a smart manufacturing initiative.  At present, North America is leading the global smart manufacturing market, on the back of the region’s established industrial sector.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      *[FT]: Financial Times

And while Parry has revealed that all the governing bodies are working in tandem and want the same outcome, clubs need to be aware of the knock on effect the outbreak could have on the game.


  “People are starting to realise that there is no rule book for this,” the former Liverpool chief told BBC Radio 5 Live on Saturday afternoon.


  “There is no manual and we are going to have to be incredibly flexible in terms of how the season pans out because we don’t know whether it is going to be behind closed doors or when it is going to recommence.


  “I think we also need to be mindful of when next season is going to start. This one being over in June and the new season starting in August is wishful thinking.


  “I think there is going to be a knock on effect for 18 months so we are going to need a lot of flexibility, a lot out of out of the box thinking and now more than any other time, a time for cool heads.

The coronavirus outbreak in India so far has claimed seven deaths and the number of cases has risen to 415. Speaking to CNBC-TV18, the former deputy chairman of the Planning Commission, Montek Singh Ahluwalia emphasised that there was an urgent need to ramp up the country's social welfare schemes.


  Ahluwalia said that the biggest priority should be to deal with the health side of the crisis. However, on the fiscal side, he said, "We should not be worried too much about what that (increased expenditure) might do to the fiscal deficit because quite honestly the fiscal deficit is going to be seriously de-stabilised because of the expected collapse in growth all over the world which will also happen in India. So, revenues are going to be low anyway."


  According to Ahluwalia, the central government must announce some programmes and fund the states. "An aspect that you have to keep in mind here is that the expenditure has to be done by the state governments. It is going to be an expenditure in hospitals run by state government, so probably the central government will have to introduce some new centrally sponsored scheme which is fast disbursing where state governments can get on with doing what is needed, maybe even get some guidance from the national teams that are working out the health strategy," he said.


  Ahluwalia further added that there is a need to expand the existing social welfare schemes. "A lot of businesses are going to be badly hurt and that is likely to lead to layoffs especially in the informal sector. So, we need to expand the existing social welfare schemes as much as we can. Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) is one of them and we should be willing to ramp it up so that it can provide fill-in for some of the loss of employment that may be taking place elsewhere," he said.


  There is also a need to moderate the debt burden on small businesses, said Ahluwalia. "Many businesses will run into difficulty, especially in the sectors that are very severely affected - airlines, transport, tourism, hotels. So, I think some measures will have to be taken to moderate the debt burden that these businesses have which would otherwise simply lead to bankruptcy and collapse."


  "Normally you would not rush in to save anyone business because it is having difficulty, but this is not a problem of one unit, this is across the board, system problem. So, I think the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) needs to step in and do what is necessary to maybe relax some regulatory norms," he added.

The COVID-19 pandemic has forced the International Cricket Council (ICC) to move to a work-from-home policy for the majority of its staff.                                                                                                                                                                                                  The ICC's top officials, including chairman Shashank Manohar and chief executive Manu Sawhney, are preparing for a video conference to address the cricket calendar being impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the world body did not specify until when it plans to carry on with this arrangement.                                                                                                                                                                                                  Most of the events, including the IPL and international tours, have been either postponed or cancelled owing to the coronavirus outbreak. The crisis has severely affected the upcoming English season as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                  "Like the rest of the world, the ICC is following guidelines from authorities and in line with the approach of our members, the majority of our staff are now working from home," an ICC spokesperson told PTI.                                                                                                                                                                                                  "Our priority is to protect the health and well-being of staff whilst remaining fully operational. The team has full remote working capacity and as a result we can keep the ICC fully functioning while keeping our staff, their families and the wider communities safe."                                                                                                                                                                                                  The pandemic, which originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan in Hubei province, has so far claimed over 14,000 lives while infecting more than three lakh people across the world.                                                                                                                                                                                                  It is learnt that for those who are not working form home, the operations will be "split across two sites to maintain critical functions and at the same time limiting the risk as much as possible".                                                                                                                                                                                                  The men's edition of the T20 World Cup is scheduled to be played in Australia in October and November, but there remain doubts over the staging of the event with the Australian government focussed on dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic first.                                                                                                                                                                                                  On March 12 the ICC had decided to hold its meetings scheduled for Dubai at the end of March via conference call only, in light of the concerns expressed by its members.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    *[FT]: Financial Times

Ford, GM, and FCA last week informed much of their white-collar workforces to work remotely, but they have kept manufacturing operations up and running despite plant closures overseas. The Volkswagen Group announced on Tuesday that it is temporarily shutting down its factories across Europe, as is Mercedes-Benz parent company Daimler, following similar decisions from Renault and the PSA Group. Ford has even said it will shut down its own European factories in order to help slow the spread of the virus on the continent, which the World Health Organization now considers to be the “epicenter” of the pandemic. And all of these companies had to deal with shutdowns in China when the government there ordered closures earlier this year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           *[FT]: Financial Times

While people are staying at homes all around the world as their governments request amid coronavirus pandemic, experts say people should be active in order to protect mental health.   There are over 339,000 confirmed cases and more than 14,700 deaths worldwide from the virus.   The World Health Organization, which has labeled the outbreak a pandemic, declared Europe the new epicenter on March 13.   The situation in Europe is worsening every day, especially in Italy, which now has more deaths than China, where the virus was first detected in December.   Many countries have declared states of emergency or curfews and are restricting transportation and trade.   Governments, non-governmental organizations and experts have advised people to stay home to stop the virus from spreading.   But how will the quarantine affect their mental health and what should they do to protect it?   Ayse Sena Saridogan, a psychologist at Istinye University Medical Park Gaziosmanpasa Hospital in Istanbul, says socializing is an essential human need.   "Being unable to leave the house will prevent this. So when we need it, it will be useful to speak with our loved ones over the phone, online or video chat," she said.   Addressing the question about protecting mental health, she said young people or the elderly can do things they were previously unable to do due to a lack of time.   "We can be stronger if we can keep our external resources (hobbies, sports, etcetera) more diverse and robust against stress," she said.   She also warned that attention should be paid to sleep patterns and a balanced and healthy diet.   Saridogan advised elderly people to solve puzzles and read books to reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease.   Clinical psychologist Gamze Dagar pointed out that distinguishing between 'taking measures' and 'unrestrained limitations' is very important for mental health.   "For instance, the most preliminary method of disinfecting the skin's surface is the knowledge that it is necessary to clean your hands with soap and water. However, when anxiety levels are out of control, people can create different skin diseases by using disinfectants or cologne excessively," she said.   For that reason, Dagar emphasized that keeping anxiety levels under control is very important for mental and physical health.   "Listening to your body after you had taken all hygiene measures whether you have any coronavirus symptoms and when you realize there are not any indications of COVID-19 will help reduce your anxiety level," she added.   She said anxiety levels may be higher in older people compared with others and dementia patients may especially be affected more negatively.   "In this case, changing the agenda and performing different activities with other family members and relatives will have a positive effect," she said.   Dagar said during quarantine days, many activities can be done in the house according to personality characteristics.   "They can do activities such as watching TV series and movies, reading books, talent activities such as painting, composing, exploring new areas with different recipes, doing physical exercise and designing plans for your life."   She also stressed that the positive psychological aspect of this pandemic can manifest itself in the long term.   "Along with the intensive life pace of people, relationships with each other, understanding each other, living together, taking common actions and social awareness can be revived," she added.   Turkey has 1,236 confirmed cases of the virus, officially known as COVID-19, with 30 deaths.   The virus, which emerged in Wuhan, China last December, has spread to at least 167 countries and regions around the globe, while the tally of confirmed cases exceeds 339,000 and the death toll is over 14,700, according to data compiled by U.S.-based Johns Hopkins University.   China, Italy, Iran and Spain continue to be the worst-affected countries.   Despite the rising number of cases, the vast majority of people contracting the virus suffer mild symptoms before making a recovery. -

Although senators of both major parties and Trump administration officials vowed to continue negotiating -- around the clock if necessary -- the vote was the latest negative signal about Congress' ability to come together around the legislation, which aims to inject close to $1.8 trillion into businesses and households. Policymakers are scrambling to address a spike in layoffs and businesses gasping for assistance as millions of Americans stay home to avoid contagion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             *[FT]: Financial Times

The presidential campaign may be on hold, but not the politics surrounding the coronavirus.


  Even as lawmakers work to pass relief legislation in Congress, the two major parties have used the pandemic as a partisan cudgel. President Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden, his presumptive November opponent, trade rhetorical shots. Critics of the president have unleashed a string of advertisements assailing his response to the medical and economic emergency, with more in the works.


  “Trump cannot be trusted. With our economy, our health and our future,” says a digital ad featuring a montage of Trump statements downplaying the contagion, which American Bridge, a liberal political action committee, is running in three states — Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — central to the election.


  The two sides are quick to point fingers, saying, in effect, _they_ started it.

Aimless hoof over the top. One defender tracks it. No attackers even bother. With nobody else in a 15-yard radius, the elite professional footballer correctly judges the slow arc of the approaching ball and nods it back to his keeper as easily and with as little conscious thought as he gives to breathing in and out. The crowd claps its absolute arse off. Lovely.

EIN News/ -- UNCEDED TERRITORIES OF MUSQUEAM, SQUAMISH AND TSLEIL-WAUTUTH NATIONS and VANCOUVER, British Columbia, March 23, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Vancity today announced a Unity Term Deposit, a new investment product that gives members a safe and secure* way to invest their money, while also putting it to work in the community supporting the people, small businesses and non- profits that are most affected by the social and economic fallout of COVID-19.  
 Many people are being hit hard in the wake of COVID-19. People are facing financial hardship as a result of reduced hours of work or layoffs. Small businesses are facing tough choices when it comes to paying suppliers, employees, or keeping their doors open. People want to help each other in tough times, so we're creating a financially secure way to do that.
 The Unity Term Deposit is being offered for a non-redeemable 12-month term at an interest rate of 3.0% and is available to any individual or business who is a member of Vancity. The new term deposit will provide a financial return for Vancity members while directly supporting people and businesses in their local economy.
 Normally, investments look for the quickest way to maximize profit. The purpose of Vancity's Unity Term Deposit is to maximize the financial help available to people so they can get back on their feet. Members will see a financial return on the money they invest, and the community will get a social return.

Weinstein was convicted in February of a criminal sexual act in the first degree and rape in the third degree, while being cleared of predatory sexual assault charges. He was convicted of raping ex-actress Jessica Mann in 2013 and of forcibly performing oral sex on former production assistant Mimi Haleyi in 2006. Nearly 90 women, including Angelina Jolie and Salma Hayek, have levelled sexual misconduct allegations against Weinstein, the Oscar-winning producer of "Shakespeare in Love" and numerous other critical and box office hits.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       *[FT]: Financial Times

If we are to demonstrate the extent of the “zombie company” problem, perhaps we can employ the financial metric Tobin’s Q. This measure shows the financial ratio of market value of a firm to the replacement cost of the firm’s asset. It is based in the hypothesis that in the long run the market value of the company should roughly equal the cost of replacing the company’s asset. If the ratio is significantly higher than 1, then one could suspect the existence of an over-valued and debt-driven zombie company.

ROMA (23 marzo 2020) - «Puo non bastare un metro di distanza» come distanziamento precauzionale tra le persone. È quanto si legge in una nota congiunta di esperti e ricercatori della Societa Italiana di Medicina Ambientale (SIMA), Universita di Bari (UniBa) e Universita di Bologna (UniBo), autori di un position paper pubblicato nei giorni scorsi, in cui si evidenzia una correlazione tra la presenza di particolato atmosferico nell'aria e la diffusione del Coronavirus in determinate aree del Paese. «Il nostro studio - si sottolinea - e condotto con metodo scientifico, basandosi su evidenze. La correlazione e presente. Che i virus si diffondano nell'aria trasportati dalle polveri trova riscontro nella letteratura scientifica. Come trova riscontro il fatto che restino attivi per diverse ore. Percio e importante ribadire che in condizioni di alte concentrazioni di particolato un metro di distanza tra le persone e necessario ma potrebbe non bastare, sia in ambienti outdoor che indoor. Occorre ridurre le emissioni al minimo e le distanze tra le persone al massimo».

If approved as expected, the agreement would end two years of delays and signal new momentum for all six Western Balkan countries - Serbia, Kosovo, Montenegro, Albania, Bosnia and North Macedonia - seeking to join the EU.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          North Macedonia and Albania had seen their hopes dashed last year as France and the Netherlands sounded scepticism over their track records on democracy and fighting corruption, fearful of allowing new members in at a time when the EU's cohesion was already damaged by Britain's departure from the bloc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           But Paris and The Hague eased their objections last month and the plans to allow talks to start have gained momentum despite the coronavirus crisis, with Brussels eager to show its determination to bring the Balkans into the EU fold.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           "I don't think what is happening (with coronavirus) is going to alter the decision of the member states," EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell told reporters on Friday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Borrell said he also telephoned Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic to reassure him of the EU's support after Vucic praised China for its help in fighting coronavirus in Serbia and questioned European solidarity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Greece was still not on board before the weekend with the decision, which requires unanimity of all EU members. But diplomatic sources said Athens has given its approval after the latest draft included stronger language on protecting Greek and other national minorities in Albania.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           If no country objects, the decision is expected to be formally adopted by the 27 EU members' Europe ministers at mid-week - in writing this time as face-to-face meetings have been suspended due to coronavirus risks - the sources added.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           French President Emmanuel Macron, who blocked the opening of talks with Skopje and Tirana in October, said in February he was willing to allow them to begin membership talks if the European Commission gave them a positive review and changed the way it admits new countries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Brussels duly did, with a reform of the enlargement process presented in February, which France welcomed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           EU governments, not just the EU Commission, now have more say over the process, ensuring hopefuls meet targets in economic, judicial and other reforms, and can reset the process if Balkan governments do not step up.

Throughout his well-traveled career, there was always one place that has Mark Janifer’s heart — Montclair.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Janifer began his coaching career at the helm of Whippany Park in 1983 and has been either a head or assistant coach at four different stops.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          But there’s a pattern in tracking his career trajectory. He was the head coach at Montclair in 1996 then came back as an assistant in the early 2000′s for five years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          After a stint at West Orange and some time off, Janifer returned under then-Mountie coach Pat Verney in 2015 before taking the head coaching job last season.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Montclair wasn’t where Janifer was born and raised. But it certainly is the home to the 2019-2020 NJ.com Ice Hockey Coach of the Year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          In his second year during his second stint at the helm of Montclair, Janifer helped the Mounties reach new heights in reaching the program’s first McInnis Cup final since 2003 (Then referred to as the Central Red Division) and its first state title appearance since 1998.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          There’s always a certain thrill of lifting a program to new heights as the head coach; That feeling only increases when one has the connection that Janifer has with the Essex County town.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Janifer, who was born and raised in Newark, spent plenty of time in Montclair visiting relatives. He moved to Montclair after marrying in 1987 and has stayed there since to raise his own family.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          “Montclair is special. I wanted to coach here," Janifer said. "It’s my hometown. What can be better than coaching in your hometown? I love the sport but I just really love the relationships that you make when you’re coaching. I feel like I’ve built a lot of relationships as a coach over the years that are really special to me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          "I always felt like it couldn’t get any better if you’re doing that within the community that you live and where you’re raising your family. I’ve always longed to coach here because it’s my community.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                          That sense of community was never more evident than with the Mounties vying for both the McInnis Cup and NJSIAA/Devils Public A state finals. Ultimately Montclair lost both games by a 3-2 margin in overtime to Summit and Morris Knolls, respectively.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Yet it was the overall support, even from those outside of the program, that made Montclair’s run to titles and prominence that much more unique.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          “One of the things about this run that was fantastic was the texts and tweets and snapchats. The fans and stuff from alumni that I was getting and the kids were getting," Janifer said. "You could feel that excitement that the school and the community had as a whole.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          "When you talk about high school sports and atmospheres for athletes to play in...If you look at our games throughout the year and especially once the playoffs started, the crowds were unbelievable. It was a lot of students but it was also alumni and parents of alumni and just people from town there. That was special. That level of excitement...It’s hard to be an athlete and not be taken aback by that. It’s a good feeling and I think it pumped our kids up playing those games in front of that support.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Despite the title game losses, the bar has been set higher for a Montclair program that snapped a state-title game drought older than its current players.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Now the expectations rise. And along the lines of other perennial state title contenders, it’s that confidence and the work ethic that follows that could keep the Mounties in state title conversations for years to come.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          “The kids that are returning are already talking about being there again," Janifer said. "I think that’s a good thing. You have to have that motivation and that belief that you can get there. The kids that are coming back realize what it takes and I think they’ll be dedicated to try and get back to the championship game. And hopefully end it with a title.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          "Once that becomes contagious...you see programs like Morris Knolls or Randolph or Summit where you know those kids go into a season where, if they work hard and do the right thing, they’ll be playing for a championship. These last couple of years I’d like to think have brought that kind of attitude back to Montclair. And from my interactions with the players I think it has. There’s already talk about what we have to do next year to be on top of our game.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                           _ _Andrew Koob can be reached at  akoob@njadvancemedia.com.

Ventilation systems, industrial machinery and equipment motor fans create substantial noise pollution. DC fans use a new form of ECM that is ultra-efficient and ultra-quiet at the same time. DC fans are perfect in diverse applications such as telecom switches, medical appliances, and car entertainment systems, where noise is often a hindrance. Quieter equipment is typically more power-intensive but it has greater benefits in the long run, spurring its adoption.North America and APEJ account for more than half the noise control system market and they are expected to retain their commanding position throughout the course of the forecast period. APEJ is on track to grow by 46 basis points in 2027 over 2017 but this will still not be enough to dislodge North America from its pole position in the noise control system market. North America should record a robust CAGR of 5.8% enabling the regional market to grow to more than US$ 15 Bn in 2027 from about US$ 8.5 Bn by 2017 end.

Enforcement of any of these orders is still up in the air. Most locations simply broke up large gatherings and sent people home because one of the last things health officials want is for people to be put in confined spaces such as jails. Many governments are even releasing nonviolent inmates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     *[FT]: Financial Times

AMD’s Polaris graphics cards are long in the tooth in 2020, but still represent fantastic value for money, as prices just keep on falling. Now easily out-performed by the new RX 5000-series, these cards are cheaper than ever, and that makes the RX 570, with its 8GB of memory, a fantastic entry- level video editing card. It has more than enough power for almost all video editing needs, and at around $150 for the 8GB version ($130 for the 4GB alternative, which is less recommendable), it’s a great buy.
