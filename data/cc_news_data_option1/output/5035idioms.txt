Christmas for junior enlisted service members’ children will be a little brighter as Fort Sill opened its annual Toys for Kids store Monday with a ribbon cutting ceremony at the Fort Sill Conference Center.
 Izamar Rosirio, a Fort Sill dependent and mother of four, said the program helped her family, who was struggling financially, give her children a better Christmas than they expected.
 “This means a lot to us,” said Rosirio. “This helps make it a little more exciting for the kids because they weren’t really expecting much this year with everything that’s going on.”
 The Toys for Kids program assists active duty soldiers E4 and below during the holiday season, said Fort Sill Morale Welfare and Recreation Community Recreation Chief Shane Dunlevy. Eligible participants must be referred by their command channels.
 “This an opportunity for soldiers and families, who may be having a hard time and obviously 2020 has been one of the crazy years, we’re giving them an opportunity to come and pick up some gifts for the kids and make sure that they have a great holiday season,” Dunlevy said.
 Commandant of the Air Defense Artillery Col. Richard Harrison gave opening remarks before inviting special guest Santa Claus to help cut the ribbon and officially open the store.
 “I can’t imagine what the kids are going to feel when they get a chance to walk in here or the parent walks in here and grab a toy off the shelf and wrap it, or haven’t wrapped here and take it back home,” Harrison said. “Christmas morning when parents wake up and see the smile on their kids faces, it’s unimaginable how excited they’re going to be. More importantly, how excited the parents are going to be knowing that their military family came together, along with donors, to help them out in this special time.”
 This is the 13th year of the program. Donations come from Fort Sill soldiers and the public and has so far collected $35,000 worth of toys.
 Toys for Kids will take place at the Fort Sill Conference Center from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. through Friday.
 Parents can choose four gifts for each child and can have the gifts wrapped on site by volunteers or take the gifts home to wrap.
 Donations can be dropped off at the Conference Center, Building 4700 or at the Child and Youth Services location.

When President Emmanuel Macron declared that France was at war with the virus and put the country into lockdown in March, Erganian and Andela both immediately understood that their surgeries wouldn't happen as planned.
 "It was a hammer blow for the family, because we were ready," says Andela, who is the carer for a man with disabilities.
 Admissions for COVID-19 aside, hospitalizations across France plunged, with 2 million fewer hospital stays from March to July compared to the same period of 2019, the French Hospitals Federation says. Cataract surgeries stopped almost entirely for eight weeks, and colonoscopies used to spot cancers plummeted by 87%. There were half as many kidney transplants from March to September, according to the federation. Its statisticians estimate that the number of patients waiting for postponed procedures has swelled by hundreds of thousands.
 Neighboring Spain was battling long waiting lists for non-urgent surgeries even before the virus caused more than 45,600 deaths there. Public health data shows that in the first half of 2020, surgeries plunged by more than a third year-on-year. The average waiting time has grown from 115 days to 170. At the end of June, 691,508 people were registered as waiting for non-urgent procedures -- 20,000 more than a year earlier.
 In Portugal, almost 100,000 surgeries had been postponed by October. And the association of hospital surgeons in Italy says more than 600,000 operations have been canceled there, 50,000 of them for cancer. By June, the association was already warning that more than 13 months would be needed to clear the backlog.
 Delays are more than mere inconveniences for patients. Erganian weighed 140 kilograms (308 pounds) before surgery; Andela was 133 kilos (293 pounds). Both were terrified of becoming infected by the virus, acutely aware that obesity puts them at greater risk of dying from COVID-19. Other than for work and groceries, Andela says she barely left the house. Erganian says she lived in "monstrous fear."
 Both gained additional kilos in lockdown. Andela wept when her nutritionist weighed her.
 "I have three kids. I dream of doing lots of things with them that I cannot do now: rollerblading, scootering, hoverboarding, going to the swimming pool without having to hide," the 33-year-old said the afternoon before her gastric bypass surgery.
 Erganian, 58, hopes to shed more than a third of her weight as a result of having a large part of her stomach cut out and be free of knee and back pain -- and of her cane. She prayed in the final weeks that her phone wouldn't ring with news of another delay.
 "In a European country as developed as France, I find it abnormal that surgeries that should have been done couldn't be carried out because of COVID," she says. "We should not be choosing between one sick person and another."
 The pandemic hit with such force initially that hospitals in many countries barely coped, but that is changing. During France's second lockdown from Oct. 30, surgeons at Bichat performed many more operations than during the first shutdown. All 22 of the hospital's operating rooms were functioning again this month.
 The operating room schedule that Aurelie Gouel manages was largely filled with gaping holes in March but is now a tightly packed puzzle of colored blocks, each representing a surgery. She likens the task of fitting in as many operations as possible to the computer game Tetris.
 Gouel calculates that the pandemic has so far forced the postponement of more than 600 surgeries at Bichat. Even with operating rooms again going full tilt, she can't see how the hospital will catch up.
 "There will always be other patients who take priority," she says. "It is going to be complicated for a long time."

South Dakota State coach Aaron Johnston was surprised that his team hadn't been in the poll for the last 11 years.
 He had a lot of really good teams over that time period, but somehow they just couldn't crack the Top 25. That drought is over as the Jackrabbits entered The Associated Press Top 25 on Monday, coming in at No. 22.
 "It's a great recognition piece and I'm excited for the team," Johnston said. "Not knowing it had been that long is a good reminder that we don't over value it either. It's great recognition and I appreciate the heck out of it and we'll fight like crazy to stay there."
 The last time the team was in the Top 25 was the 2008-09 season and then stayed in the poll for 10 weeks after first appearing on Dec. 22, 2008. South Dakota State reached as high as 16th in the final poll that season.
 Johnston knows how difficult it can be to get top programs to play his team and his squad benefited from some late schedule changes to have the opportunity to get ranked. The Jackrabbits beat Top 25 teams Iowa State and Gonzaga so far this season which helped South Dakota State enter the poll.

Fifty-two years ago this week, his term in the White House drawing to a sad close, President Lyndon B. Johnson gathered members of his Cabinet together and delivered a strong message.
 “We are now approaching the last month of this administration,” he told them. “It is neither desirable nor equitable to bind the hands of the next administration in major program areas unless there is overriding necessity to do so. We should not needlessly foreclose the options of the new administration to initiate their own program changes. It would be particularly unfair to take actions now which must be implemented over a long period of time.”
 Both Johnson, a Democrat, and his successor, Richard M. Nixon, a Republican, were ferocious partisan pugilists. They disliked each other and reviled each other’s motives and actions. Indeed, they had spent their lives in opposition to each other. Their enmity was as great as that of Donald J. Trump and Joseph R. Biden Jr. And yet the transition transpired with hardly a hiccup.
 The American presidential transition is an American political tradition.
 But like so many traditions, the customs and folkways that governed the rhythms of Washington have been altered in the Trump years. The president still is litigating an election that was conducted more than a month ago, his administration is only reluctantly permitting Biden to get a grip on the reins of government, and the country is witnessing the most fraught presidential transition since Gerald R. Ford became president after the resignation of Nixon — or since Johnson became president after the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Both those hurried transitions occurred after national tragedies.
 Indeed, the peaceful transfer of power was a tradition that began in 1801, when John Adams gave way to his rival, Thomas Jefferson. Over the years there were bumps on the transition road, but no swerves off that road, until now.
 In 1933, President Herbert Hoover tried to enlist his successor, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, in his efforts to fight the Great Depression, but the New York governor did not want to be pulled into the Hoover universe and did not want to be tied by his predecessor’s policies. “It’s not my baby,” he said. The two met in the White House the day before the inauguration, which in those days was March 4, and Hoover asked his successor to support him in closing the nation’s banks. “Like hell I will!” Roosevelt replied, adding, “If you haven’t the guts to do it yourself, I’ll wait until I’m president to do it.” The 31st president didn’t, and the 32nd did.
 Twenty years later, Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower swung by the White House but did not join Harry Truman for coffee on Inauguration Day. Instead, he waited in the car for the president to join him for the ride to the Capitol. Not that Eisenhower relished that 16-block drive. He said he wondered “if I can stand sitting next to that guy.”
 Even so, the transition in both cases was basically smooth.
 For all the years-long tension between Nixon and Johnson — who was Senate majority leader when Nixon, as Eisenhower’s vice president, served as president of the Senate, and who was on the Kennedy ticket that defeated Nixon in 1960 — the transition between the two men was, in comparison to the 2020 spectacle, the very model of the peaceful transfer of power.
 It began even before the election. Johnson appointed Charles Murphy — a onetime Truman speechwriter, the former administrator of the Civil Aeronautics Board and a veteran of the 1953 transition to Eisenhower and the 1961 transition to Kennedy — as his transition officer. “I concluded that if I did not make an attempt to set up a transition machinery myself,” Johnson wrote in his memoir, “that step would not be taken.”
 But there was more. In a Pittsburgh meeting with Billy Graham before the election, Nixon told the prominent evangelist to convey a message to the president, saying that while the Republican ticket running against Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey might criticize administration policies, there would be no personal criticism of Johnson himself and, moreover, that if Nixon were elected, he wanted a warm relationship with his predecessor. Shortly thereafter, Murphy told the president that the Republican team had been informed “that while we’re not going to help Nixon get elected, if he should be elected, we will do our best to help him get off to a good start.”
 Indeed, six days after the election, the Nixons joined the Johnsons at the White House. There was lunch, questions about policy, an offer for briefings for the Nixon Cabinet nominees and a couples’ tour of the White House living quarters. Nixon suggested later that he expected Johnson would consult with him on major matters. Johnson recoiled at that notion. “I could not allow the impression to stand that Mr. Nixon had become a kind of co-president,” he said.
 The contretemps ended swiftly. Johnson made a presidential jet available to Nixon, and the president-elect’s advisers were given office space across the street from the White House — and access to the White House telephone switchboard and automobiles.
 Two men of different parties, different outlooks and different personalities made the transition work — all despite the fact that Johnson knew that Nixon had been party to a disgraceful act of foreign-policy interference as Election Day drew near. Anna Chennault, the widow of World War II “Flying Tigers” hero Claire Chennault, had urged South Vietnam President Nguyen Van Thieu to stay away from Paris peace talks that might have produced a breakthrough in the conflict in Southeast Asia, a development that could have boosted the election prospects of Humphrey, who was tied to the Johnson administration’s Vietnam policies.
 Now we watch as a presidential transition that might have been conducted at an awkward coronavirus social distance unfurls in even more awkward circumstances. Biden might feel as Ulysses Grant did in 1869; he refused to sit beside his predecessor, the impeached Andrew Johnson. Trump might feel like the first President Johnson, who didn’t attend his successor’s inauguration. That was before television images raced across the country. A divided nation requires a moment of national unity to warm the chill of a January transfer of power.

C. Vivian Stringer, the 72-year-old coach of the Rutgers women's basketball program, worries that her daughter who lives with her might be especially vulnerable because she had spinal meningitis at age 2 and still deals with the effects.
 "I'm concerned about myself and definitely Nina," Stringer said. "We've got to look out for everyone surrounding us. This is crazy."
 North Carolina coach Roy Williams, 70, said he respects the virus, but he can't focus on it too much.
 "The biggest thing is, if you spend all your time worried about that, you're not ready to get the job done or not spending your time preparing your team," he said. "We've got to do everything we can and be able to handle the new information, and be able to handle the next new information and be able to handle the next information."
 Adjustments have become the norm. Oklahoma opened the season at home Dec. 3 against UTSA in a game that was supposed to be played the previous week. Players wore masks in warmups. Seats on the bench were separated and in rows rather than one long row. There were just a few socially distanced cheerleaders on hand, next to a small band.
 Kruger said it was a different experience.
 "You're always trying to do the right thing, but it's not normal to be wearing a mask all the time," he said of being on the bench. "We don't wear it during timeouts, but when play starts, we're wearing it."
 Izzo, 65, tested positive for COVID-19 on Nov. 9 and isolated at his home for 11 days. He said it was hard to be away from the team. Izzo was thankful after he got through it.
 "While some people who have tested positive have not been affected too much by it, I am here to tell you that this virus is no joke, and everyone must take this seriously," he said.
 Even if all the proper precautions are taken, the risks remain.
 "I'm sure a lot of people have gotten COVID without understanding why or it just happened, and we may get it as well," Kruger said. "But we do everything possible to increase our chances of not getting it."

  "It's what I've wanted to do since I was in the eighth-grade," the Morenci senior said. "I've worked my butt off to get this opportunity. I'm so excited about it."


   


  Price was Morenci's No. 1 pitcher her freshman and sophomore seasons when she compiled a 33-21 record with 295 strikeouts, 151 of them coming when she was in the ninth-grade. She's a veteran of travel softball, too, playing for high- level teams that have traveled across the country - and even to the Dominican Republic.


   


  "We play some of the best players in the U.S.," she said. "I've played against a lot of the top players, girls who are going to Central Michigan or the University of Michigan or just about everywhere."


   


  Price was born and raised in Morenci and is the daughter of Chuck and Amy Price, both Morenci graduates. Her dad has been her catcher since she started her softball journey at the age of 6.


   


  It was just a few weeks ago that Toledo softball coach Joe Abraham called with the news that Price would have a spot on the Rockets roster for the 2021-22 academic year.


   


  "I had the call scheduled so I went into my room because I wanted to be alone," she said. "When he offered me a spot, I accepted quickly. I knew that's what I wanted. When I hung up the phone I just sat there for a minute on my bed. I went downstairs and told my dad. He got a little emotional. It's something I've worked so hard for."


   


  Morenci coach Kay Johnson said the University of Toledo coaches were impressed with Price's work ethic.


   


  "Their coach was really impressed with how hard she works," Johnson said. "She works hard and does all of the things she needs to do to get where she wants to go. She goes to camps, she pitches every chance she gets, she works out. Her family is very supportive of her. She's definitely committed to softball."


   


  Price said she made her first visit to the University of Toledo in middle school.


   


  "Every athlete says that when they first step on a campus they will know if it is right for them," she said. "That was me with Toledo. From my first time there I told my dad that is where I want to go. I feel safe there. I've always wanted to go there."


   


  In addition to playing for Morenci and travel teams, Price also works with pitching coach Erinn Gankosky out of Total Sports in Rossford, Ohio, traveling to the center south of Toledo for drills and instruction. She played some first base for Morenci, but pitching is what she wants to do.


   


  "I've been pitching since I was 6," she said. "I love the competition. I like to be in control of the game."


   


  Her fall travel season ended recently but plans on pitching at a tournament in Florida in February. She's confident that she will get to pitch this spring for Morenci.


   


  Price doesn't plan on letting anything get in the way of pitching at UT.


   


  "I want to make an impact at UT," she said. "I know I'm not going to go there a light up the place, but I have goals.


   


  "I've had to work hard for everything," she said. "I'm all of 5-foot-3 and a half. Most Division I pitchers are much bigger than that. I know that. I'm from a small town where not a lot of people play Division I. I know that but this is my dream. I know how hard I have to work."

DEAR READER: In a nutshell, a homeowner's association is a group run by residents living in a particular residential community. It could have been started by a real estate developer when a neighborhood was planned, then handed back over to the residents. An HOA elects a board that manages the common areas and makes and enforces rules for the residents.

They often say that if your feet are warm, you stay warm.
 It’s a notion that the warm hearts of members of the Mistletoe Lodge No. 31 & Knights of Pythagoras, in conjunction with the Third Masonic District, kept in mind with this year’s holiday giving effort.
 On Saturday, the culmination of a sock drive arrived as more than 2,500 pairs of socks were given out to C. Carter Crane Shelter, Marie Detty Youth & Family Services, the Salvation Army Homeless Shelter and the VA Veterans Center to help many in need avoid cold feet for Christmas.
 “We know a lot of homeless people, they go through socks a lot,” said Timothy Bowles, Knights of Pythagoras Second Committee Person. “It’s important for them to not have wet feet, that creates sores that blister and make it almost impossible for many to walk.”
 Bowles said the unified effort between the two organizations, in conjunction with the Third Masonic District, was a community effort to show love and care to those who could use it most the Christmas season.
 From in front of the Mistletoe Lodge No. 31, 1607 SW Pennsylvania, volunteers were ready for representatives from the four designated recipient organizations to arrive and collect those many socks.
 Teresa Bland, Past Matron of the Lodge, said it’s one of the many efforts these service organizations seek to make a difference in the community.
 “Especially this time of year,” she said. “It’s essential to take care of the community. This year, it’s vital.”
 As she looked at the many socks to give, Bland said that “it’s just a great day to have a great day.” It’s one of the things that makes the Masonic family, as a whole, to make everyone happy, even if they’re under hard circumstances.
 Some of the volunteers have been past recipients of efforts like this, Bland said. Once you receive, you want to give back. And that, she said, is the spirit of the season in a nutshell.
 “You have to give back,” she said. “We don’t even know how fortunate we are.”

You are 100% correct. People scream and scream and complain everything falls on deaf ears as far as the Board of Supervisors who are supposed to be the ones to hold her accountable. You try to ask the CEO for any information you just get a huge gigantic circular conversation that blame shifts off to everyone and 6 months later you wind up back at the point you started. It's ridiculous the games that they play and the lack of efficiency all of the money that gets awarded for Grants or new programs gets wasted and squandered down by the higher-ups before anything even happens. It's pretty gosh darn pathetic to watch this happening over and over again when smaller counties arerun much more efficiently and even larger counties run fantastically well and here we are in our swirling cesspool. No help from the higher-ups no help from the attorney general, grand jury reports fall on deaf ears. We should change the name of Mendocino County to Tarpit County. Because that's basically what happens everything gets stuck in the tar pits and that's it.

It drives many of these people to seek the help of mental health professionals whose modus operandi can be reduced to test, diagnose, and medicate. Do things get better? For some, perhaps, but having been there, I long ago concluded that playing it by the book might make things less obvious in the short run but never "sticks." Furthermore, that sort of formulaic approach usually worsens things in the long haul.

Reboots usually suck. That we can all agree on, right? Peacock is the new network on the block, and it's banking on nostalgia for Tracey Wigfield’s _Saved by the Bell_ reimagining. This new version lets Zack Morris and AC Slater take a backseat for a new batch of high schoolers at Bayside. How does it fair? One thing is for sure: Josie Totah is a bonafide star and she deserves a full awards campaign. But first, we start our podcast with a discussion of HBO’s recently finished _Murder on Middle Beach_ , the emotional 4-part true crime drama from director Madison Hamburg. The director’s mother was brutally murdered in 2010 and he has spent nearly an entire decade devoted to finding the truth. It’s one of the best shows of the year.

_(“Tulsa Time,” Don Williams)_ So much of country music comes from the blues, and you could really feel that blend in the deliveries of Ian and Tamara in particular.

We just found ourselves really enjoying how Ian and Tamara interpreted the song with a more modern vibe and energy. This might have looked like and odd trio on paper, but they really delivered.

Compassion? Yes indeed. The child is in pain. There is no such thing as a happy child who cannot stop acting in no one's best interests, least of all his own. Under the circumstances, teaching the parents to embody and properly convey authority amounts to a rescue operation. Proper consequences — making the child offers he cannot refuse, but will anyway because he's not thinking straight — are part of the recipe but proper consequences absent a proper parental attitude will accomplish nothing in the long run.
