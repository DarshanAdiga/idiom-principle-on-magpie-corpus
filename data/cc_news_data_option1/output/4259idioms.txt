India is closing in on an agreement with the United States that will give it access to satellite data for better accuracy of missiles and drones, government and industry officials said, as it tries to narrow the gap with the powerful Chinese military.
 The two sides are expected to announce the pact during the visit next week of US secretary of state Mike Pompeo and defense secretary Mark Esper for talks in New Delhi with Indian counterparts Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and Rajnath Singh.
 The United States, which antagonised Beijing this week by approving the potential sale of three weapons systems to Taiwan, has also been pushing for stronger security ties with India to help balance China's growing regional influence.
 US companies have sold India more than $21 billion of weapons since 2007 and Washington has been urging the Indian government to sign agreements allowing for sharing of sensitive information and encrypted communications for better use of the high-end military equipment.
   
   
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi's cabinet discussed the final draft of the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement on Geospatial Cooperation on Wednesday, an Indian government source said.
 An accord would provide India with access to a range of topographical, nautical and aeronautical data, a defence industry source said.
 It would also allow the United States to provide advanced navigational aids and avionics on US-supplied aircraft to India, the defence source said.
 "It is a foundational agreement, which the US has signed with many of its partners for greater interoperability," the source said.
 India has traditionally been hesitant about getting drawn into a US-led security alliance and antagonising China. But tensions have risen dramatically with China this summer, erupting into a clash between border troops in the western Himalayas.
 This week New Delhi agreed to invite Australia into next month's naval exercises scheduled with the United States and Japan, disregarding concerns it would anger China, which sees such a grouping as directed against it.
 "In tandem, the moves signal a new level of strategic convergence between the two democracies and a break from India's 'non-aligned' past," said Jeff Smith, a South Asia expert at the Heritage Foundation, about the proposed pact.
 Already there is robust intelligence sharing between US and India, particularly about Chinese activity in the region, a second government official said.
 This includes information on PLA deployments on the Indian border and also Chinese maritime activity, including its deep water fishing fleets, which have caused friction between Beijing and other countries.
 "They are sharing a large amount of data," said the official.

Hello there and welcome back for more from this barmy Vuelta. After the first two stages were big GC days, today we have... another big GC day. This one finishes at Laguna Negra at the top of a first-category climb and, if the first two days are anything to go by, we're going to get more movement. Remember when Grand Tours filled whole first weeks with sprint stages? If this is the new normal I'm on board.

They are cut from the same cloth, driven by their own ideologies. One comes from a position of privilege and is with the State, while the other is a messiah to the oppressed and tries to destabilise the establishment. They are both armed, but what sets them apart is that while one is bound by the conventions of law and order, the other is not.
 Kamal Haasan’s DCP Adhi Narayanan and Nassar’s Badri, leader of a militant outfit, gave an edge to the PC Sreeram-directed _Kuruthipunal_ , making its proceedings rather unusual and contemplative than what could have been a regular cat-and-mouse game.
 There is a general anger against the system at fault that creeps into the narrative. Sreeram agrees that the anger and resultant feeling of being dwarfed by the system were what attracted him towards remaking _Kuruthipunal_. “In that sense, it is a very personal film. If you look at the photographs we had used in the first scene, we were angry with what had happened in the country,” says Sreeram over phone, “The anger in me was a reflection of my shots; the camera was always in close proximity with the subject. I don’t have a theory behind it, but this was the way I wanted to tell the story.”

Sure. So look, I'm not going to tell you who it is, but who it might be. When we know, we'll let you know. But I think I've said before, look, we're looking for somebody that really understands this business, who can look at the entire landscape of our markets and other markets, determine which businesses we ought to invest more in, invest less in, looking for somebody with great leadership talent and qualities. We're looking for somebody with a track record of execution of the strategy. And so clearly, the candidates that we've seen all have those qualities and many more. We went through a pretty exhaustive process with our search firm to build a succession planning process over the last 18 months or two years. And now that it's time to execute on that, we've hit the ground running. And so we had lots of criteria that we were looking at, and the candidates that we've looked at, many of them have met all of those and more. So I'm really excited about it. I'm happy to work with a new CEO for whatever period of time, either as Executive or Non- executive Chairman. And so we'll have that done by the end of the year, and we'll go from there, and then you'll know exactly what they look like.

Jones, 18, signed a three-year deal with Rovers, who beat a number of clubs from the Championship and League One to get him, but he will head back to The Seagulls on loan for the rest of the season.
 “It’s a big opportunity for me to progress and and push on to the first team here (Bristol Rovers) and show everyone what I can do,” Jones told the club’s website.
 “It’s good for me because I don’t have to change my life in anyway, I still live at home, it’s perfect really and only down the road.”
 Jones has played at left-back for Weston this season but can operate as a winger and has gone on to hold down a main role his campaign and scored four goals and three assists in his 19 games so far for the club.
 Jones will work under Ben Garner and the teenager has bought into the policy of Rovers giving players a chance to progress, regarding of how young they are.
 “He was just saying age has never really been a problem for him and he’s trying to build a young squad to progress and hopefully move up Rovers through the league and progress younger players onto bigger things,” Jones added.
 “It’s great to know age really isn’t a massive factor when it comes to picking the team or anything like that. It’s good he gives young players a chance, hopefully I will get my chance.”
 Garner was pleased to secure the services of Jones, his 12th and last signing of a busy transfer window, adding: “We are pleased to welcome Ryan to the club. He’s a talented young player that has attracted widespread interest over the summer and we are delighted that we have been able to win the race for his signature.
 “He is playing regularly and developing really well with Weston so immediately returns there on loan. We look forward to working with Ryan moving forwards.”
 Upon returning to Weston, Jones has targeted helping Scott Bartlett’s side get into the National League South before aiming to cement a place in the starting 11 with The Gas when he is back for the 2020-21 season.
 “This season is to help Weston push for promotion, I know that’s their aim, score goals, get assists along the way and then when I come back next season hopefully to push for a place in the first team.”
