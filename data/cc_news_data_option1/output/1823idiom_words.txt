Fleabag star Phoebe Waller-Bridge and her boyfriend Martin McDonagh may be victims of their own success with their romance being the collateral damage of their continued achievements – according to reports.
 The 34-year-old TV actress has been in a romance with 50-year-old director Martin since 2018.
 However, they have both seen their careers take huge strides since then – with Phoebe finding fame with her quirky BBC Three comedy and subsequently landing huge film deals like writing upcoming Bond movie No Time To Die and signing a reported £50 million deal to write shows for Amazon.
 While Oscar winner Martin thrilled Hollywood with his black comedy Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri which snapped up gongs galore in 2018.
