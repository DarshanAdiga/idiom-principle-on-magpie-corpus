  In-person services at the Burlington Public Works Department will be temporarily closed for a week, following two cases of COVID-19 among its employees.


  The news was first report on the department's social media pages on Oct. 16, as officials learned that an individual who had been tested earlier for the virus came back with a positive result. Two days later, Public Works received news of an additional case at their main offices at 645 Pine St.


  "After consulting with the Vermont Department of Health we do not believe there is any risk to the general public who has visited our offices," a department news release stated.


  "Out of an abundance of continued caution, however, we will not be offering any in-person services during the week of [Oct. 19]."


  In-person services at the Pine Street offices will resume on Oct. 26. Residents are encouraged to call or email the department for matters related to public works, permitting and inspections, and parks and recreation, or to report issues through SeeClickFix.
