SAKHIR, Bahrain
 Romain Grosjean has been ruled out of the second Formula One race in Bahrain and will be replaced by Pietro Fittipaldi, a grandson of former F1 champion Emerson Fittipaldi, the Haas team said Monday.
 Grosjean was hospitalized with burns on the back of both hands after his car collided with a barrier in the Bahrain Grand Prix on Sunday and burst into flames.
 Haas said it anticipated Grosjean would be discharged Tuesday. His injuries mean he can't compete in the Sakhir Grand Prix on Sunday, the second race in Bahrain, which will use a shorter outer loop at the same venue.
 "After it was decided that the best thing for Romain was to skip at least one race, the choice to put Pietro in the car was pretty easy," Haas team principal Guenther Steiner said.
 "Pietro will drive the VF-20 and he's familiar with us, having been around the team for the past two seasons as a test and reserve driver. It's the right thing to do and it's obviously a good opportunity for him."

" _Care concittadine e cari concittadini, vorrei dirvi semplicemente grazie. Grazie per l 'affetto ed il calore che mi avete fatto sentire attraverso i tantissimi messaggi che ho ricevuto o che ho potuto leggere sui social. Mi hanno scaldato il cuore. Grazie in particolare a S.E. il Vescovo per la sua benedizione a me dedicata durante l'ultima Messa domenicale. Probabilmente ho contratto il virus durante il mio intervento al dormitorio. Un intervento necessario per il ruolo che svolgo per il bene della comunita e che mi espone comunque a qualche rischio in piu. Da qualche giorno il quadro clinico stava iniziando a peggiorare. Pertanto, consapevole delle complicanze che possono manifestarsi dalla quinta giornata anche in virtu delle mie conoscenze mediche, nella giornata di sabato ho fatto un secondo accesso in ospedale dove sono stato sottoposto a Tac polmonare con evidenza di polmonite interstiziale in fase iniziale. Di conseguenza e stato consigliato il ricovero per consentire di iniziare la terapia antivirale, effettuabile solo in ambiente ospedaliero. Le mie condizioni stanno gia migliorando. E approfitto per ringraziare il personale delle Malattie Infettive, cosi come quello del Pronto Soccorso e di tutto il Santa Maria Goretti per l'eccezionale lavoro che sta svolgendo con impegno, gentilezza e professionalita. Cosi come il mio pensiero va a tutti i pazienti che stanno combattendo con il Covid. È importante avere fiducia, forza, determinazione e soprattutto attenzione e cura dei propri sintomi e delle loro variazioni. In particolare per coloro che sono a casa e importante il rapporto con il proprio medico curante. Infine in generale un pensiero per tutti coloro che ancora non hanno la consapevolezza del rischio che stiamo correndo. Abbiate rispetto per chi sta male, per coloro che li assistono e si espongono al contagio, per le forze dell'ordine e per chi svolge servizi essenziali al pubblico esponendosi a loro volta al contagio. Infine cercate di avere rispetto per voi stessi e per i vostri cari. Quindi: mascherina, distanza e igiene delle mani. Ce la mettero tutta per guarire il prima possibile e per tornare quanto prima alla piena attivita di Sindaco della nostra citta. Auguro al Presidente del Consiglio, a tutti i componenti del Consiglio stesso, alla Giunta e a tutto il personale del Comune, che ringrazio per il senso di responsabilita che stanno mettendo al servizio della comunita, una buona giornata di lavoro. Auguro ai nostri concittadini e alle nostre concittadine, soprattutto a chi in questo momento ha difficolta lavorative, di uscire quanto prima dalle criticita di questa seconda ondata dell'emergenza Covid-19. Ci riusciremo e la faremo tutti insieme. Torneremo ad abbracciarci. Forza Latina_."

Most progressive commentators took Trump’s naked attempt to retain power through mass disenfranchisement as vindication of their darkest interpretations of his politics and presidency. Popular faith in the authenticity of vote counts is a precondition for a minimally healthy democracy. Trump waged war on that faith, as no losing president had done before. What’s worse, his quixotic attempts to overturn the results revealed that the bulk of Republican officialdom was prepared to either quietly abide anti-democratic treachery, or actively abet it. Liberal alarmism had, therefore, been realism all along. As my colleague Jonathan Chait recently put it, “these weeks of chaos will remove all doubt of something Trump’s critics have long maintained: The American experiment would never have survived a second Trump term.”

The most promising vaccines so far all require cold storage, Deaton said. Clinics across the state will need sub-zero freezers to store the serum, but the technology is already widely available — they’re widely used by farmers who breed cattle and other livestock, he said.


  Just how to transport, store and administer the vaccine depends on which one gets approved first and which one the VA selects, Deaton said.


  “But that’s all doable,” he said. “I’m not saying it won’t be hard, but it’s doable.”


  Another question is who gets the vaccine first. Deaton said it’s possible the VA could opt to inoculate its providers first to protect both clinic staff and the patients they treat. Otherwise, he expects Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines will lead the way.


  Testing for SARS-CoV-2, the virus behind the pandemic, is also available at VA clinics, Deaton said. They’ve been working closely with county health departments to get veterans tested and now have the analyzers they need to test for two types of influenza, the novel coronavirus and respiratory syncytial virus — it causes a cold-like illness that’s typically mild and gone in a week or two, but can be serious in children and older people, according to the CDC.


  Test kits and other materials the analyzers need just arrived so VA clinics around the state are being “a bit judicious” in how they’re being used until more kits arrive, Deaton said.


  Veterans can help by getting their flu shot, Deaton said. It’s available at VA clinics at no cost, and some pharmacies will provide it for free to veterans enrolled in the VA system. It’s especially important because the flu and COVID-19 have similar symptoms when they first start to show.


  ”If they do get sick and they have had their flu shot, then we kind of know which direction to take,” he said.


  Michael Roof, Grand Traverse County Veterans Affairs director, said he can help connect veterans to services even after statewide orders shuttered most government offices. His is now appointment-only, and those who call ahead have to answer some questions to screen for exposure to the disease.


  Once they arrive, they must call again from their car, answer some more screening questions and if they’re OK and wearing a mask, they can come inside, Roof said. The number of people coming in has dwindled considerably since the pandemic’s onset.


  “I think some people are leery to come out and about, for sure,” he said.

There are very fine people on both sides of this dunk contest. Each general tendency has its insights. The left-contrarians are right that the risk of Trump retaining power through a coup — whether a literal military putsch or a figurative judicial one — was greatly exaggerated in some quarters, especially after it became clear that any such scheme would require invalidating tens of thousands of votes across multiple states. There is little incentive in the news media to frame novel developments in anything but the most incendiary terms that one can reasonably defend. Cable news faces more competition, from a wider array of televisual amusements, than ever before. The digital news landscape is largely populated by ad-supported outlets fighting each other for eyeballs in a content-saturated market, often to the death. For these reasons, coverage of Trump’s flirtations with authoritarianism often err on the side of alarmism. And this has real costs (some of my own friends and family members were still living in fear of Amy Coney Barrett anointing Trump the election’s victor long after that ceased to be a remote possibility).

The new results put the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based biotechnology company on track to have one of the first COVID-19 vaccines to be cleared in the U.S. A similar vaccine from Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE was submitted to U.S. regulators earlier this month and is scheduled to be reviewed ahead of Moderna’s shot.


  Moderna said it plans to apply on Monday for an emergency-use authorization for the vaccine in the U.S. and for conditional marketing authorization in Europe. Advisers to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration will likely scrutinize the data at a public meeting on Dec. 17, the company said, one week after a similar review of Pfizer’s vaccine is expected to take place.


  "We have been working nonstop in the last few weeks” to get the vaccine data ready to submit to regulators, Stephane Bancel, Moderna’s chief executive officer, said in an interview. Once authorities sign off, the company will move quickly to distribute the shots, part of a vast vaccination effort that will unfold as hospitals in the U.S. strain under a surge in infections.


  "We are ready today to ship the vaccine,” Bancel said. "We have millions of doses ready, we have more and more every couple days.”


  If the vaccine is cleared in the U.S., which Bancel said could occur as soon as 24 to 72 hours after the Dec. 17 meeting, Moderna’s entire inventory will be sent to the federal government. New lots will be shipped as soon as they pass muster, Bancel said. The company expects to be able to ship 20 million doses in the U.S. by the end of the year.


  The new analysis showed the vaccine worked consistently well in older and younger adults, as well as minorities, the company said. Moderna didn’t disclose the vaccine’s exact efficacy in those groups, and Bancel said that more detailed data is still being finalized.


  Overall, there were 185 cases of COVID-19 in trial participants who got a placebo, and 11 cases in people who got the vaccine.


  As mandated by the FDA, Moderna said it had also accumulated two months of safety data from its final-stage trial of more than 30,000 participants. Reported side effects included injection-site pain, fatigue, muscle or joint pain and headache. The side effects were more common and severe after the second dose of the two-dose vaccine, Moderna said.


  The results bolster an interim analysis released on Nov. 16, which showed the vaccine was 94.5% effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 and successful in preventing the most severe infections.


  On Nov. 20, Pfizer and German partner BioNTech became the first to seek emergency U.S. clearance for a vaccine, after their shot was 95% effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 in the final analysis of a nearly 44,000 participant trial. That vaccine application will be reviewed by a panel of FDA advisers on Dec. 10, potentially paving the way for it to become available soon after that.


  Both the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines rely on a technology called messenger RNA that turns the body’s cells into vaccine-making factories. Messenger RNA has never before been used to develop an approved vaccine. Moderna, which has co-developed the mRNA candidate with the National Institutes of Health, has already reached agreements to supply 100 million doses to the U.S. and 80 million to the European Union, among others.

Voglio ricordare che a questa inedita fase politica nazionale si è arrivati certamente su pressione del presidente Mattarella, che continua ad avere un ruolo importante per far prevalere l’interesse del Paese, ma il merito di aver ideato e portato a termine l’operazione a livello nazionale è del Presidente Silvio Berlusconi e di un’azione preparatoria di Forza Italia, come è stato da più parti riconosciuto e pubblicamente sia da Conte che dai leader della sua coalizione. Il voto unitario – maggioranza ed opposizione - in Parlamento alla legge sullo scostamento di bilancio è molto significativo perché unisce scelte di finanza pubblica e di politica economica. Berlusconi è infatti riuscito in un’impresa che per molti sembrava impossibile: convincere i partiti di maggioranza ad accettare le proposte economiche del centrodestra, fino a ieri ignorate e sottovalutate, tra le quali l’introduzione della tregua fiscale e di consistenti aiuti ai lavoratori autonomi e alle partite Iva.

This means weekly reporting of COVID-19 deaths and positive cases among residents and staff, numbers of suspected cases, incidences of staff shortages as well as supply numbers for personal protection equipment.


  The additional reporting is intended to help MDHHS get a handle on the spread of the disease among the elderly and vulnerable populations, and the people who care for them, officials say.


  “This information is useful to understand the impact of COVID-19 on long-term care facilities, target resources and supports such as iPRAT and support planning,” said Lynn Sutfin, MDHHS spokesperson.


  The Infection Prevention Resource and Assessment Team is made up of communicable disease experts who can field questions about outbreaks, infection prevention and interpreting guidance from the Centers for Disease Control, information on the state’s website shows.


  The data is updated weekly on the state’s Coronovirus dashboard and can be helpful to families of residents and community members in understanding the impact of COVID-19 within a specific facility or region, Sutfin said.


  She was quick to add a COVID-19 positive test is not necessarily an indicator that a facility isn’t following proper procedures or employing appropriate mitigation strategies.


  On Wednesday DHHS staff hosted their third webinar to instruct administrators of adult foster care and homes for the aged on the new reporting rules and help them complete the initial registration.


  Those who haven’t complied — whether because of a technology gap, a steep learning curve or an unavoidable logistical delay like the one Jewett referenced — can expect a phone call from MDHHS, Sutfin said.


  “The biggest reason for not reporting is not being aware of the requirement,” Sutfin said. “As facilities learn about the requirement they comply. The biggest barrier is identifying the appropriate contact and method for electronic communication with facilities.”

Trump’s “coup” was surely quixotic. But it delegitimized our electoral system in the eyes of a large minority of the public, while also creating incentives for Republican officials to administer elections in a more partisan manner going forward. Before November 3, Georgia’s Republican secretary of State, Brad Raffensperger, was a rising star in GOP politics. After the Peach State went blue, and Trump cried fraud, both of Georgia’s GOP senators called for Raffensperger’s resignation, all for the crime of administering an election that a Democrat won. America’s aberrant practice of having partisan officials oversee elections has always been hazardous. Now that Republican secretaries of State know that presiding over a Democratic victory won’t just cost their party in the short term but, quite possibly, cost them personally in the long run, the temptation to tailor election rules to the GOP’s advantage will be all the greater.

“I wasn’t exactly sure what was going to be down the line in the next few weeks,” the 32-year-old Durand said.


  Durand was one of 30 Short’s employees laid off in early spring, which means she was one of the nearly 3 million people to file an unemployment claim in Michigan since March 15. Durand was also eligible for and received the extra $600 per week in pandemic-related unemployment assistance.


  The latest data report from the Michigan Unemployment Insurance Agency shows $26.2 billion in unemployment benefits have been paid out since March 15. Nearly $20 billion of that has gone toward some sort of pandemic assistance, including $3.68 billion to the 1.7 million people who made a claim for the additional $600. Another $1.55 billion has been paid out in lost wages assistance.


  Durand returned to Short’s once the original slate of restaurant restrictions were lifted in May, but the “three-week pause” ordered by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has Durand’s unemployment anxiety creeping up again.


  “It’s the unknown,” she said. “I definitely don’t think this is just going to be a few weeks. This is going to keep going, and you never know what’s going to happen. This has all been so strange.”


  Scott Newman-Bale, CEO of Short’s, said he has had to lay off eight people so far — but that was under the assumption that the restrictions last three weeks.


  “We could definitely do with laying off some more people, but we’re not going to go crazy,” Newman-Bale said. “We decided to try and just suck it up and support everyone as best we can.”


  That support extended to his laid-off workers as well. Newman-Bale said they presubmit employee claims to the UIA, designate it is a COVID-related layoff and go through the process showing the employee how to best navigate the system. Newman-Bale said they also offer free food, no questions asked, to anyone who needs assistance — employee or not.


  Food sales are not too far off from normal, Newman-Bale said, but alcohol sales are well down.


  “People aren’t drinking,” he said. “Well, they are at home, but they’re not drinking here.”


  An extension on the COVID pause could push the unemployment system in Michigan back to the breaking point it was at in the spring.


  Currently, unemployment officials are receiving 33,000 calls per day, but staff are handling just 23,000 of those calls, according to weekly data released from the UIA. The five-county region has more than 6,600 active unemployment claims, with Grand Traverse County making up more than half.


  An independent report from the UIA released Wednesday concluded the overwhelming number of claims and calls spurred changes that left the system vulnerable to fraud. Attempts to speed up the system for the newly unemployed and move through claims quicker included policy changes that loosened verification requirements and shortcuts to process applications faster.


  The report showed hundreds of millions of dollars in unemployment benefits may have been disbursed incorrectly to people trying to take advantage of the system.


  In May, nearly 650,000 claims either had pay stopped or were not paid because of difficulty verifying identities, the report showed. Resolving those issues would have taken a year, so “temporary procedural changes” were made to the identity verification process to move through the claims.

Following the Yoruba world view about death, Tejumola Olaniyan, no doubt, has become an ancestor.While many may argue that he died young, at the age of sixtyyet, he remains an ancestor in the sense that he biologically fathered grown-up children and mentored many established scholars and graduate students. As a father, in an academic sense, Tejumola Olaniyan qualifies to be venerated as an ancestor. He is worthy of a mask and voluminous regalia that will immortalize him as a profound literary critic and an excellent cultural studies scholar. That way, the academic community he belonged to would accept their loss, that is, his death, and his masque would invoke his memorialization. _E_ _é_ _g_ _ú_ _n Teju_ (Teju's masquerade) will be a big masquerade that can match his larger than life frame. The regalia, of course, would capture his tall and lanky frame and as well parallel his _ìwà pẹ̀lẹ́_ (humility)that he displayed everywhere he went.

Il sindaco di Latina, Damiano Coletta, è ancora ricoverato al Santa Maria Goretti per via della sua positività al Coronavirus che gli ha provocato una polmonite interstiziale bilaterale che deve essere monitorata. Il primo cittadino ha voluto però recapitare un messaggio ai cittadini e al Consiglio Comunale che si è riunito oggi. A leggerlo all'Assise, riunita in remoto, è stato il Presidente del Consiglio comunale, Massimiliano Colanzingari.


  "Care concittadine e cari concittadini, vorrei dirvi semplicemente grazie. Grazie per l'affetto ed il calore che mi avete fatto sentire attraverso i tantissimi messaggi che ho ricevuto o che ho potuto leggere sui social. Mi hanno scaldato il cuore. Grazie in particolare a S.E. il Vescovo per la sua benedizione a me dedicata durante l'ultima Messa domenicale. Probabilmente ho contratto il virus durante il mio intervento al dormitorio. Un intervento necessario per il ruolo che svolgo per il bene della comunità e che mi espone comunque a qualche rischio in più. Da qualche giorno il quadro clinico stava iniziando a peggiorare. Pertanto, consapevole delle complicanze che possono manifestarsi dalla quinta giornata anche in virtù delle mie conoscenze mediche, nella giornata di sabato u.s. ho fatto un secondo accesso in ospedale dove sono stato sottoposto a Tac polmonare con evidenza di polmonite interstiziale in fase iniziale. Di conseguenza è stato consigliato il ricovero per consentire di iniziare la terapia antivirale, effettuabile solo in ambiente ospedaliero. Le mie condizioni stanno già migliorando. E approfitto per ringraziare il personale delle Malattie Infettive, così come quello del Pronto Soccorso e di tutto il Santa Maria Goretti per l'eccezionale lavoro che sta svolgendo con impegno, gentilezza e professionalità. Così come il mio pensiero va a tutti i pazienti che stanno combattendo con il Covid. È importante avere fiducia, forza, determinazione e soprattutto attenzione e cura dei propri sintomi e delle loro variazioni. In particolare per coloro che sono a casa è importante il rapporto con il proprio medico curante. Infine in generale un pensiero per tutti coloro che ancora non hanno la consapevolezza del rischio che stiamo correndo. Abbiate rispetto per chi sta male, per coloro che li assistono e si espongono al contagio, per le forze dell'ordine e per chi svolge servizi essenziali al pubblico esponendosi a loro volta al contagio. Infine cercate di avere rispetto per voi stessi e per i vostri cari. Quindi: mascherina, distanza e igiene delle mani. Ce la metterò tutta per guarire il prima possibile e per tornare quanto prima alla piena attività di Sindaco della nostra città. Auguro al Presidente del Consiglio, a tutti i componenti del Consiglio stesso, alla Giunta e a tutto il personale del Comune, che ringrazio per il senso di responsabilità che stanno mettendo al servizio della comunità, una buona giornata di lavoro. Auguro ai nostri concittadini e alle nostre concittadine, soprattutto a chi in questo momento ha difficoltà lavorative, di uscire quanto prima dalle criticità di questa seconda ondata dell'emergenza Covid-19. Ci riusciremo e la faremo tutti insieme. Torneremo ad abbracciarci. Forza Latina".

CAIRO (AP) — Artillery fire killed at least 11 civilians, including four children, near Yemen’s strategic port city of Hodeida amid that country's grinding war, an international charity said Monday. Yemen's internationally recognized government blamed the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels for the attack. A spokesman for the Houthis did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Save the Children said the attack took place Sunday when shells hit home in the town of Durayhimi, just south of Hodeida, which handles about 70% of Yemen’s commercial and humanitarian imports. The shelling wounded 10 others. “It’s appalling to witness more and more children losing their lives in their own houses, where they supposed to feel safe, play and study,” said Xavier Joubert Save the Children’s Yemen director. The war in Yemen erupted in 2014, when the Houthis seized the capital and much of the country’s north. A Saudi-led coalition, determined to restore the authority of President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi’s government, launched a sweeping military intervention months later. More than 600 civilians have been killed or wounded in Hodeida in the first nine months of 2020, according to Save the Children. Sunday’s attack came just two weeks before the second anniversary of a cease- fire aimed at ending fighting in Hodeida. That deal, inked in December 2018 in Sweden and seen as an important first step toward ending the conflict, was never fully implemented The head of the U.N. mission to Hodeida, retired Gen. Abhijit Guha, urged both sides to adhere to the 2018 U.N.-brokered agreement. “Now is the time to hold fire and stop a cycle of military escalations that will worsen the dire humanitarian situation on the ground,” Guha said in statement.
