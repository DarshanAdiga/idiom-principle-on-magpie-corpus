The move marks a change in the Public Health Agency of Canada's approach to the outbreak, as Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam has repeatedly said that as the number of affected countries increases, border measures typically become less feasible and effective.
 "(Iran) is a country with rapidly escalating cases with local transmission," Tam said Monday. "The rapid escalation in cases together with the actual exportation to Canada was a key aspect of that decision."
 Symptomatic passengers will be asked to fill out a form with their contact information so that public health officials can follow up with them. If travellers have symptoms, such as a fever or dry cough, they will be assessed at the airport.
 Global Affairs has also updated its travel advisory to urge Canadians to avoid all non-essential travel to Iran.
 Iran has confirmed 1,501 cases of the virus and 66 deaths. Many believe the true number is larger, as the country's caseload surged more than 250 per cent in just 24 hours.
 Canada has also increased its advisory level for northern Italy, and some regions of South Korea, due to the virus.
 Canada is not at this time considering banning travel to certain regions altogether, Tam said.
 "Viruses know no borders. We have to balance our public health measures knowing they're never completely perfect," she said.
 Some of the COVID-19 cases in Canada, including the first case linked to Iran, were detected before any cases were confirmed in their country of origin. That is a cause of concern, Tam said.
 She said all international travellers, including those crossing land borders from the United States, have been asked to monitor themselves for symptoms regardless of where they have been and report to their local public health authority if they have concerns.
 She also advised anyone planning a large gathering, such as Nowruz, the Persian New Year, to consult with their local public health authority and be prepared to adjust their plans.

“Caution, preparedness, but not panic,” Adams said. “That’s how we’re going to successfully navigate this coronavirus situation.”

MLB has drawn attention recently for employing one of the more progressive drug policies among major-league sports.
 The NFL is currently negotiating changes that would end suspensions for players caught using marijuana, but still fine them for their trouble. Negotiations have reached a sticking point with players unhappy with league requests to increase the number of games per season from 16 to 17.
 The NBA, for its part, has signalled it intends to revisit its drug policy this year.
 The MLB memo makes clear, however, that allowing cannabis use is not the same as endorsing it. "Club medical personnel are prohibited from prescribing, dispensing or recommending the use of marijuana or any other cannabinoid" to players or officials, nor are they allowed to store it at the team facilities, it notes.
 CBD remains a tricky substance for baseball players because the non- intoxicating cannabinoid found in marijuana has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or certified by NSF International. Furthermore, it could be tainted with other substances that are on MLB's banned list.
 The league and its players association reported they "are working closely with NSF International to develop an independent testing and certification process for" hemp-based products, according to the memo.
 The league also plans to unveil guidelines for players and personnel interested in participating in the billion-dollar cannabis industry but said, "until such guidance is issued, any such investments or commercial arrangements are still considered to be prohibited in accordance with current practices."
