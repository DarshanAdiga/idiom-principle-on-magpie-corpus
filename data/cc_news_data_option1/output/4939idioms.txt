Bloomberg) -- Manhattan’s federal courthouse has halted jury trials and in- person meetings until Jan. 15, citing Covid-19 concerns.
 Starting Tuesday, civil proceedings and certain criminal matters will be held remotely, Chief Judge Colleen McMahon of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York wrote in an order. No new grand juries will be selected until Jan. 19, although existing grand juries can continue their work.
 “This temporary curtailment of operations is required to preserve public health and safety in light of the recent spike in coronavirus cases, both nationally and within the Southern District of New York,” according to the order dated Monday.
 The court previously halted jury trials in March, resuming them in September.

That castle (or, at least the version rebuilt in 1703 after an earthquake) is now a tourist destination, housing both a ninja and a samurai museum. All these centuries later, this is where the livestream of the class is coming from. Post-video, an English translator guides those watching through what's now the ninja museum, including an area with interactive exhibits like a short climbing wall and a fake pond offering lily pads ninjas could presumably hop on if they were there in person.
 "In person" anything feels like a distant dream right now. But as much as the coronavirus pandemic has shrunk our worlds, the internet has also offered us the opportunity to expand them. In October I learned to make pretzels via Zoom. For my birthday, I got to introduce friends from high school, college, grad school and work to each other in a mind-bending virtual birthday party. Now, for $14, I can bust out of my Louisville apartment, in a sense, and take a class in a country I've never visited.
 Waiting in the museum is Hiroshi Jinkawa, a noted ninjitsu practitioner. He's decked out in the black ninja uniform you'd expect, including a mask (the ninja kind, not the thing your aunt sewed for you back in March).

COLUMBUS, Ga. (WTVM) - Community activists are wondering what can be done to stop the violence in Columbus.This weekend, two men were shot and killed in two separate incidents in Columbus. Attorney and activist Teddy Reese said too many young men are dying.Forty-three people have lost their lives in a homicide this year in Columbus. Reese said it’s time to stop talking and start acting.“I think the community is sick and tired of carefully crafted statements and words of comfort. They want action, some real plans. We need our leaders to be actionable. We’ve heard enough talk, now let’s see what we’re going to do,” said Reese.Reese said he believes a change in law enforcement leadership may help with a new sheriff and new police chief coming in. However, he said the main people who need to be involved are community members, not allowing their neighborhoods to turn to violence.Copyright 2020 WTVM. All rights reserved.

The commander in chief has also previously threatened to veto the 2021 NDAA bill, vowing to do so last summer after Democratic Senator from Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren successfully inserted an amendment aiming to rename US military bases honoring Confederate commanders. The bill, which calls for a staggering $700 billion-plus in military spending for next year, passed both chambers of Congress earlier this year and is now in final negotiations in conference committee.
 Though the White House has reportedly worked behind the scenes in recent weeks to press lawmakers to repeal Section 230, the chair of the Senate Commerce Committee, Roger Wicker (R-Mississippi), has proposed an amendment to the NDAA that would push a more _" limited change"_ to the provision, according to Axios. It remains to be seen whether that approach can be reconciled with the president's.
 It is also unclear if Trump could carry out his threat to veto, given that the NDAA secured veto-proof majorities in both chambers earlier this year. However, it could be made possible if Republican lawmakers backing the bill changed their votes.

I had read a book that recommended that before quitting a job for business, one needs to learn to diversify their corporate experience. So, I intentionally worked in various roles including setting up offices across Africa, and other general management roles that allowed me to become an all- rounded person. In Ghana, I rolled up my sleeves and supported the business in debt collection. In Nigeria, I set up the business by sourcing for offices, furniture, conducted staff interviews and did some pitches - all in two weeks! Once I got diverse experience, I was ready to exit. As I mentioned earlier, quit and try your hand in business when you have steady passive income. If you quit your job without passive income, you will be very stressed if the company does not do well. Bear in mind that it takes two to three years for a business to stabilise.

SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic — Forge FC lost a heartbreaker to Haiti's Arcahaie FC in Scotiabank Champions League quarterfinal play Tuesday, conceding a cheap goal on a goalkeeping blunder in regulation time and then losing a penalty shootout.
 The win earned Arcahaie a berth in the 2021 CONCACAF Champions League, alongside the confederation's elite club teams, while moving it into the final four of the CONCACAF League — a 22-team feeder competition that sends six teams to the top-tier CONCACAF tournament.
 Forge, the Canadian Premier League champion, has a chance to make the Champions League via a do-or-die play-in match next week.
 Guerry Romondt saved Forge's first two penalties — from Daniel Krutzen and Alexander Achinioti-Jonsson. Arcahaie substitute Ose Charles converted the decisive kick in the 4-2 shootout win.
 The game was knotted at 1-1 after regulation time with Forge dominating play. but unable to get the go-ahead goal.
 "Obviously this is one that stings," said Forge coach Bobby Smyrniotis.
 "We've played two games in the last 2 1/2 months. This is the third one," he added. "So there's some kind of rhythm that's not going to be there. And the toughest thing to do in this game is score goals."
 Forge looked in complete control up 1-0 early in the second half but conceded the tying goal in the 59th minute on a mistake by Triston Henry. He delayed playing a back pass from Kwame Awuah and his scuffed clearance attempt deflected in off onrushing Arcahaie forward Kervens Jolicoeur.
 "That's something maybe that's going to happen once in his career," Smyrniotis said.
 "This one kind of stings but he's fantastic. He's goalkeeper of the year in the Canadian Premier League for a reason. It's unfortunate that this comes at this moment but we've got to look past it," he added.
 After the tying goal the game was delayed by a hole in the Arcahaie goal netting, requiring several zip-ties to close the gap.
 Krutzen opened the scoring in first-half stoppage time from the penalty spot after David Choiniere was taken down in the box by Hantz Anacius. Romondt dove the right way but Krutzen's shot found the corner.
 Krutzen also converted a penalty — in second-half stoppage-time — to give Forge a 2-1 win over Panama's Tauro FC in the round of 16.
 The 24-year-old Belgian defender rattled a free kick off the Arcahaie crossbar in the 49th minute as Forge tormented the Haitians with set pieces.
 The four CONCACAF League quarterfinal winners qualify directly for the Champions League while the losing quarterfinalists compete in single-leg play- in games, with the two winners also qualifying.
 Arcahaie advances to play either Costa Rica's Deportivo Saprissa or Honduras' Club Deportivo Marathon, who played in a later game Tuesday, in the January COBCACAF League semifinal. Saprissa won the CONCACAF League last year.
 Forge will play the Saprissa-Marathon loser next week in the play-in match.
 Regulation time ended with Forge driving at the Arcahaie goal but unable to get the go-ahead goal. It was the same for the seven minutes of stoppage time with Arcahaie players going down like bowling-pins, delaying play.
 Tuesday's game went ahead despite one Forge staff member and two Arcahaie players testing positive for COVID-19 ahead of kickoff.
 CONCACAF said all three had been isolated. All other players and staff tested negative.
 Smyrniotis made two changes to his starting 11 with Johnny Grant returning from suspension to take over from Kadell Thomas and fellow midfielder Paolo Sabak replacing Elimane Cisse.
 Forge pressed from the opening kickoff while the Haitians looked to counter- attack. Choiniere almost scored for Forge in the opening minute but couldn't get a boot to a low ball sent across the front of goal by Grant.
 Forge dominated possession but could not translate it into scoring chance. And the Haitian side began to grow more comfortable on the ball as the deadlock continued.
 Romondt was called into action twice late in the first half, punching away Forge free kicks. Mo Babouli thought he had scored on the stroke off halftime, heading in another free kick, but was flagged offside.
 While Arcahaie was the home side, the game was played in the Dominican capital of Santo Domingo at the more suitable Estadio Olimpico Felix Sanchez.
 The Haitians advanced Nov. 5 with a 3-1 round-of-16 win over Waterhouse FC in Kingston, Jamaica. Forge dispatched Tauro two days earlier in Panama City.
 The Canadian side then returned home, serving the mandated 14-day quarantine. Forge arrived in the Dominican on Nov 21, training in Punta Cana before making the 170-kilometre trip to the capital on Monday.
 Arcahaie moved into the round of 16 when Belize's Verdes FC pulled out of their Oct. 20 preliminary-round match due to positive COVID-19 tests. That match was also scheduled for Santo Domingo.
 Forge defeated El Salvador's CD Municipal Limeno 2-1 in San Salvador on Oct. 22 in preliminary-round play.
 Forge, thanks to its triumph in the Island Games in Charlottetown during the summer, will also have another chance to qualify for the main CONCACAF club competition when it takes on Toronto FC in final of the Canadian Championship scheduled for the first quarter of 2021.
 Forge exited the CONCACAF League in the round of 16 last year, beaten 4-2 on aggregate by Honduras's Olimpia.

I've never felt less like a ninja in my life. Sitting on my bed under a pile of blankets. In sweat pants. Wondering how long it'll be before I can get the prescription on my glasses updated.
 Yet here I am, watching a livestream of the Online Ninja Training Experience, a 40-minute class promising "the secrets of the ninja world." I'm hoping it'll teach me some stuff I didn't know about ninjas, and even a few crucial ninja skills.
 Thanks to a typical Eurocentric education, I don't know tons about feudal Japan. And surely no amount of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, or the Pirates vs. Ninjas game folks played on Facebook a decade ago, was going to teach me to sort out where truth and myth about these ancient, skilled covert fighters converge. So, a rainy Friday at 5 p.m. seems like the perfect time to start learning, and maybe even to walk away with some actual ninja skills. As the world races toward apocalyptic anarchy, they might come in handy.
