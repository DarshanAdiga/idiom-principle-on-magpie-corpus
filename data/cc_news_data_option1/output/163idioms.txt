 A beautiful, full, and fun life came to a peaceful end, Saturday, January 11, 2020 with the passing of Stuart K. Graham at Campbell House Hospice in Collingwood. He shared 61 fun years with his supportive wife, Diane, and along with raising a family, they travelled the world together. He will be dearly missed by their three fabulous daughters and their husbands, Lindsay and Jeff Hartley, Sydney Graham, Wendy and Tom Hind, along with the pride of his life, his nine grandchildren - Ryan and his wife Jessica, Sandy and Mackay Hartley, Adam, Graham and Matthew Cameron, Bryar, Ally and Riley Hind, as well, his late sister Donna's family, Peter, Scott and Craig. Stu attended Ryerson Institute of Technology. He was on their hockey team and graduated from the School of Graphic Arts in 1955. During that time, he spent three summers working at the Banff Springs Hotel. With the help of many people, Stu built Canadian Fine Color Company Ltd. across Canada. He was also an Ault Award recipient for his industry. Stu was very involved in the graphic arts industry. He was president and director of many associations within the industry. In 1992, his company, Canadian Fine Color, received the Canadian Award of Business Excellence for their work in emission reduction. Stu was a member of the Young Presidents organization and actively engaged in the AAA forum, for over forty-one years. Those years provided deep and lasting friendships, education and trust that was the foundation for growth in business and in his life. After retirement in 1996, he and Diane moved permanently to Collingwood, where, with their many wonderful friends, enjoyed skiing, boating, tennis and golf. They spent the winter months in Longboat Key, Florida, making lifelong friendships. A celebration of life will be held at Alpine Ski Club, Collingwood, ON, Sunday, May 31, 2020 at 2 p.m. In lieu of flowers, donations to Hospice Georgian Triangle - Campbell House would be appreciated.

Florida currently lacks dentists - roughly 5.5 million Floridians live in areas designated by the federal government as having a shortage of dentists; and, 63 of Florida's 67 counties have at least one shortage area. Overall, it would take more than 1,250 dentists to remove the designation. With the need for additional oral care providers in Florida so great, it will take multiple solutions to help alleviate this crisis.
   
 One solution on the table in the Florida legislative session that opens Tuesday, which would allow the state to expand its workforce and welcome a new oral care provider, would be the authorization of dental therapists. Mid-level providers who would fall on the dental health team between a dentist and a dental hygienist, dental therapists provide basic, routine oral health care under the supervision of a dentist.
   
 When first authorized to practice in Florida, I believe dental hygienists would make excellent dental therapist candidates. The dental hygienists on my team, such as Michelle Cunningham, not only have an in-depth understanding of the oral health field, but they are familiar with the dental team, our setting and tools, procedures and have received much education and training in the field already.
   
 If dental hygienists were able to receive the additional education and training to become a licensed dental therapist, we could reach many more Floridians who need our services, especially the underserved in vulnerable populations, as dental therapists can deliver care in community-based settings, such as in schools, rural settings or nursing homes.
   
 In addition to helping reach more Floridians who need oral health care, allowing dental therapists to practice in Florida would afford dental hygienists the chance to further their education, open more doors for employment opportunities and enable these providers to gain more experience. It would also create an entirely new niche, for those who are interested in entering the medical field, to consider.
   
 In fact, schools in Florida, such as Miami-Dade College, have indicated they would be willing to implement dental therapy programs should the measure pass; and, as other states have dental therapy programs in place, Florida will have the same national standards as dental and dental hygiene programs when implementing program requirements and objectives.
   
 For the limited procedures they may perform, such as fillings, stainless steel crowns, pulpotomies, cleanings or sealants, dental therapists are trained to the same national standards as a dentist. After also passing the clinical licensing exam as dental candidates for the procedures they have in common, dental therapists would apply to the Florida Board of Dentistry for licensure.
   
 With other medical teams including mid-level providers, such as a physician's assistant in medicine, it seems as though the dental industry would follow suit. Currently, 12 states allow a dentist to hire a dental therapist and I urge our Florida lawmakers to approve this new provider this legislative session.

Retail construction, rent and occupancy rates have been steaming full speed ahead in the region in recent years, but that growth could well slow this year, Colliers International Northeast Florida says in its most recent semiannual retail report.
   
 At just 3.9 percent, vacancy rates are historically low, and at $18 per square foot, average rents are nearly 5 percent up from December 2018. Construction activity, meanwhile, while low compared to previous cycles, is still elevated, the researchers state.
   
 The area around the St. Johns Town Center continues to lead the way in activity.
   
 "The Southside unquestionably remains the epicenter of the retail world in North Florida," said Nancy Sumner, director of retail services for Colliers International Northeast Florida. "The infill location, good access, relatively high surrounding incomes and the mass provided by St. Johns Town Center make the Southside the most sought-after retail location in Jacksonville."
   
 From a pure retail development perspective, Duval County's neighbor to the south continues as kingpin in Northeast Florida, added Jason Ryals, executive director for Colliers International Northeast Florida.
   
 "St. Johns County remains the strongest submarket for new retail development, with 428,000 square feet of space under construction this year -- nearly double the volume underway in the second most-active submarket, Nassau County, with 240,000 square feet under construction," he said.
   
 Apart from Phase II of the massive Durbin Park development, and potentially Fuqua Development's proposed $300 million Village Center at Interstate 295 and Butler Boulevard, few large-scale retail developments are on the books for the region in the next three years, which will spell good news for existing landlords, according to the Colliers report.
   
 Despite solid retailer activity, problematic is a lack of experienced franchisees ready to take risks in new and proven concepts during this higher rent and franchise fee cycle. Retailers in general are becoming more hard- pressed, which can affect occupancy.
   
 "This is particularly true for new construction centers, where rents can reach into the $40 [per square foot] range and beyond to support construction costs," the researchers stated.
   
 With financing still plentiful, some owners took advantage with large sales in recent months, the largest transactions being Brixmor's sale of the 195,000-square-foot Shoppes at Southside to CORE Investment Management for $23.3 million or $214 per square foot, the 77,400-square-foot Beach Plaza sale to Ash Properties by LNR Partners for $19.4 million or $131 per square foot, and Katz Properties' purchase of the 74,400-square-foot Bolton Plaza in Orange Park from Kite Realty Group for $18.1 million or $104 per square foot.
   
 In forecasting 2020, a leveling-out due to growing headwinds appears to be on the horizon, according to Colliers.
   
 "Rent growth has peaked on the retail front. Rental rate growth has been outpacing retail sales growth for more than seven years now, and that cannot continue indefinitely," Ryals said. "Unless consumer spending growth accelerates, retail sales growth will limit the net operating income growth of landlords. For 2020, we see moderating rent growth, limited large-scale construction and flat occupancy."
   
 In other news:
   
 ● Topaz Capital Group of New York has made its second major recent purchase in the River City, buying the 281-unit Plaza Apartments in the University Park area near Jacksonville University. Creative Realty Partners of southern California was the seller, according to its website, and the off-market transaction was handled by Berkadia.
   
 The 38-building property at 3780 University Club Blvd. sold for $19.6 million, Multi-Housing News reports, and the deal involved Topaz assuming a $12.1 million Fannie Mae loan originated by Arbor Realty Trust.
   
 Topaz Capital said it will invest $2 million to upgrade the 46-year-old property, including renovations to all interiors, common areas, pools and recreational areas, and adding a dog park, gym, small library and playground. It is re-branding the complex as Topaz Plaza JAX.
   
 Topaz Capital CEO Marc Hershberg told GlobeSt.com that The Plaza Apartments is "in an appealing area of the city near Jacksonville University that is seeing major gentrification."
   
 "It is right by the university, which is bringing in younger people," he said. "The talent pool in the area is increasing, which we believe will eventually bring more housing to the area. We saw this property as being one of the untapped properties in the area in terms of rehab potential."
   
 Topaz teamed with Lynd Opportunity Partners of Texas in June on a $35 million purchase of the 444-unit multifamily community Mission Springs at 5327 Timuquana Road in Ortega Farms. It rebranded it as Topaz Villas Jax.
   
 ● Annual home value growth across the country is at its lowest pace in seven years, with the Jacksonville metro area seeing an increase about the same as the U.S. growth rate, according to Zillow's most recent Real Estate Market Report.
   
 Across the U.S., home values had grown to an average $243,225 as of November, up 3.8 percent compared to November 2018. In Northeast Florida, the typical home was valued at $226,800 as of November, also up 3.8 percent from the same period in 2018. In comparison, home values in the region were growing at a 7.3 percent clip year over year in November 2018.
   
 Rents rose 3.7 percent year over year to $1,373, the third monthly increase in a row, according to the report. That compares to the typical U.S. rent of $1,600, up 2.3 percent from November 2018. Meanwhile, about 1,300 fewer homes were for sale as of last November, a 12 percent decrease from the same time the previous year.
   
 Annual home value growth declines have been widespread across the U.S., according to Zillow's researchers; in the 35 largest metros, only San Antonio and Washington, D.C., grew at a faster annual rate than they did year-over- year in November 2018. San Jose, Las Vegas, San Francisco and Seattle slowed the most. Phoenix values grew fastest, up 6.1 percent, followed by Columbus, Ohio, at 5.9 percent, Charlotte, up 5.8 percent, and Indianapolis, up 5.7 percent.
   
 ● Meanwhile, in a separate Zillow Home Price Expectations Survey, the Jacksonville area ranks No. 10 as one of the hottest housing markets for 2020.
   
 Zillow and Pulsenomics surveyed 110 economists and real estate experts, and the panelists expect U.S. home values to grow by an average 2.8 percent this year. Markets in the South should see the biggest uptick, while pricey California markets will keep slowing.
   
 The share of panelists saying they believe a market will outpace the U.S. average was weighed against the share who felt it would underperform, to create a net score.
   
 For the Jacksonville metro area, 36 percent of panelists expect home values to grow faster than the expected national rate, 24 percent expect them to grow slower, and 40 percent expect them to grow about the same as nationwide. That led to a net score of +12, good enough for 10th place, ahead of markets like Miami (-8 net score), Las Vegas (+5) and Seattle (0), but behind areas such as Tampa (+29), Charlotte (+59) and Atlanta (+51). Austin ranked No. 1, with a net score of +76.
   
 ● Invitation Homes, a single-family home leasing company, recently celebrated a year of giving back to local communities. At its 16 locations, employees contributed time and money to help their neighbors.
   
 In Northeast Florida, team members donated funds to help the Women's Center of Jacksonville. Orlando employees helped build a new home along with Habitat for Humanity and gave toys and gift cards to Dove Tree Christian Help. And in Tampa, backpacks and school supplies were donated to foster teenage boys through Loving Children; personal hygiene items, toys and school supplies were given to Youth and Family Alternatives; lunch was cooked for Ronald McDonald House; and food was organized for Feeding Tampa Bay.
   
 "We want to be a good neighbor in each of our locations," said Dallas Tanner, Invitation's president and chief executive, in a news release. "That's why we encourage our associates to spend time partnering with local organizations to provide support to those in need in their communities."

Following World War II, the Cadillac models were largely carry-over styling from before the war. One way to tell a 1947 Cadillac from a 1946 model was the full wheel covers referred to as “sombreros” because of their size and shape. Hydraulic power windows were available, and Cadillac became even more of a luxury car, selling 61,926 for the 1947 model year. Packard outsold Cadillac from 1947 to 1949, but starting with the new 1950 models, Packard was never in the running again, and Cadillac clearly was again the “Standard of the World.”

BALLANDEAN Tavern’s biggest event of the year is back, promised to be both bigger and better than last year.
 The classic Aussie-themed bash is back for a second year in a row, following its immense success in 2019.
 Tavern owner Naomi Day said January 26 was set to be a huge one for the business, with a big day planned.
 “Last year was huge, so we are hoping we can do the same thing again this year,” Mrs Day said.
 She said the idea was for people to come down and spend the majority of the day celebrating with family and friends.
 “It’s going to be a massive day,” she said.
 The tavern will be open from 10am, with meals from 11.30am and games starting at 2pm.
 “It’s fancy dress so you have to come dressed up as your favourite Aussie icon,” she said.
 “We are going to have a massive slide, lots of Aussie games, karaoke.
 “It’s going to be a fun day that the whole family can enjoy.
 “As long as the kids are happy then mum and dad are happy.”
 Mrs Day said there would be plenty of prizes up for grabs.
 “We have heaps of local and non local businesses and people donating prizes that will be raffled off,” she said.
 “Prizes will include pamper packages, accommodation packages, all that kind of stuff.
 “All proceedings from the raffles will be going to Granite Belt Drought Assist.”
 Food will be available all day with good Aussie tucker meals on the menu.
 “We will have food in the morning and evening and a tappers menu in the afternoon.”
 The event will take place at Ballandean Tavern on Sunday, January 26 from 10am.
