While this is correct, the circumstances of that request were not quite made clear and so, here is an attempt to put the record straight. Firstly, I did not ask permission to return to be by my wife's side for the birth. When I left with the Indian team for the (1975-76) twin tour of New Zealand and the West Indies, I was aware that the baby would come while I was away. I was committed to playing for India and my wife backed me to the hilt.

If you’re like most people, your anxiety level has gone up lately — perhaps way up. And chances are, you’ve seen what social media is advocating as a solution: #stressbaking — with thousands of pictures and recipes for cakes, cookies, pies and other sugar-filled treats.
 Although lab studies indicate that sugar does temporarily cool your body’s stress response by suppressing your ability to crank out adrenalin in the long run, sweet treats interfere with self-regulation of emotions, and increase chronic inflammation and boost your risk for many physical and mental health conditions (which can make you very nervous). Plus, a typical Western diet, with lots of added sugars, leads to a 25% to 35% greater risk of depression (anxiety’s kissin’ cousin) than a Mediterranean or Japanese diet does.
 So if you want to eat your way to true calmness, we’ve got some foods and spices that’ll do the trick.

It is expected to replay a war-like situation. There are reports that the first stage of FAU-G will be modeled on the tense situation in Galwan Valley, Ladakh. In August, there was a tense standoff between Indian and Chinese troops in Galwan which saw about 20 soldiers getting killed. This resulted in a string of anti-China protests and it saw many Chinese apps being shut down by the Central Government. No, apparently, it will be added as a feature in the later updates. Multi-player options are reportedly not available in the first update.

Nostalgia is always comforting. Trends that take us back in time keep resurfacing, reviving the fashionable memories of that era. This time, it is eyewear chains. Borrowing from the 70's, this style injects a dose of vintage in our wardrobes this season. International fashion houses such as Burberry, Celine, Gucci, Fendi, Stella Mccartney have experimented with eyewear chains. Rolling back home, the runway here also saw sunglasses paired with chic chains. Is the trend here to stay?"Chains with glasses are practical, fun, and make a very stylish statement without seeming over the top. But as is the case with most trends, it remains to be seen how long they remain 'in' for," says jewellery designer Eishita Puri. Jewellery designer Ayushi Kanoi says they are a fun option to go for. "Chains with glasses were fashionable back in the day but was a fad that moved on and now it might be returning. It looks fun, quirky, and very stylish, says KanoiWhen buying these chains, what to keep in mind? "Durability of the chain. You don't want a chain that's too flimsy because it may break easily with prolonged use. At the same time, you want a chain that will be easy to pair with different glasses and that can be effortlessly styled with various looks," says Puri. How to styleYou can style them with anything and everything. Wear it like Gigi Hadid casually for an errand tour. Or wear it with a blazer and shirt for a more formal look. If planning a beach holiday, sunglasses with chain will look great with printed kaftans.
