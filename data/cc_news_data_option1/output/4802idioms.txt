The initial unwillingness of elections officials to certify results in Wayne County, Michigan, the alleged interference of Sen. Lindsay Graham in the certification process of the results in Georgia and now suggestions that Republican legislators in key states could simply ignore the election results and nominate pro-Trump electors are unparalleled threats to democracy.
 This isn’t about Republicans or Democrats anymore. It’s about those who believe in democracy versus those willing to risk living under a fascist regime.
 If you’re among those who voted for Trump — and there were many — you may have had good reasons. But supporting Trump’s efforts to unravel a clear and unequivocal result must be resisted by anyone who calls themselves an American or a patriot.
 There may be a lot we as Americans disagree on these days. But if the will of the people to choose who leads is no longer a shared value, we are in deeper trouble than we imagined.
 It’s time to stand up and be counted. That goes for people in Trump-leaning towns. That goes for local talk show hosts who parrot lies and conspiracy theories. And that goes for anyone who posts falsehoods on Facebook or Instagram. You are aiding and abetting fascism. Time to stop.
 It’s also time for majority Democrats to listen harder to the voices of those who have drifted to the right. There is a growing perception that the Democrats are beholden to wealthy elitists on the one hand and progressives on the other. Those in the middle are clearly looking for someone who can speak to the hopes and fears of every working American.
 Over the next two months we will write a new chapter in American history. We’ll either put partisan interests aside and reinvest in democracy or we will allow a bully to continue down a dangerous path. It’s time to appreciate what the flag really means. It’s time to be a real patriot.

“in the second half, we did a good job of containing him,” Phillips said. “But we couldn’t get off the field. The main thing was that we knew that we had to contain him. He’s a great player, he’s one of those magical players.”
 Houston amassed 399 net yards against the Patriots' defense, with 344 of those yards coming in the air.
 Watson riddled the Patriots for his fifth 300-yard passing game of the season and his seventh game with multiple-TD passes. Houston had three players with 80 receiving yards each as Watson completed five passes for gains of 20 yards or more during the first half, and completed 76 percent of his passes (28-for-37) overall.
 “If you let him out of the pocket, you know that it’s going to be a long day,” Phillips said. “That’s what it was. You can’t give up 27 points like that. You got to give the offense a chance and we didn’t do that.”
 “We fell short,” Patriots DB Devin McCourty said, even though Houston netted just two second half field goals. “We talked about it all week, how explosive the (Houston) offense was. At times, we did a good job, but they made more plays than us in some key situations — in third down, in the red area or a key two-minute drive before the half.
 “Watson is dynamic, it’s not like he’s a statue back there. He was able to bide some time, he did a good job of escaping. He put a lot of pressure on us, depending on what our rush or pass coverage was.”
 It didn't help that the Patriots missed on a number of tackles.
 “We don’t play guys that are easy to tackle in this league, so it comes down to execution and leverage,” said McCourty. “We let them get extra yards even if there was a tackle. They executed better than us

Troopers called for backup and blocked the vehicle from leaving the scene. The driver, Thompson, appeared to be intoxicated and was arrested on charges of driving under the influence and weapons misconduct. Troopers notified Thompson’s employer.
 At 1:19 a.m. Monday, Fairbanks trooper dispatch received a 911 call from two men reporting a man in civilian clothing had identified himself as a law enforcement officer, rammed their vehicle and pointed a gun at them.
 Soon after the 911 call, Thompson called Fairbanks troopers and said he was a law enforcement officer and was following a vehicle after an altercation. Dispatch advised Thompson to stop following the vehicle, but he disregarded their instructions, according to the news release.
 Tok-based troopers responded to the scene and determined Thompson was intoxicated. He was arrested on charges of DUI, weapons misconduct, impersonating a peace officer and three counts of felony third-degree assault, according to troopers.

“The people of Michigan have spoken. President-elect Biden won the State of Michigan by more than 154,000 votes, and he will be our next president on January 20th,” Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, said, adding it is “time to put this election behind us”.


  Mr Trump was increasingly frustrated by his legal team, led by former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, whose erratic public performances drew bipartisan mockery in recent weeks. Nevertheless, the legal challenges were expected to continue, as Mr Trump seeks to keep his supporters on his side and keep his options open for opportunities post-presidency.


  In Pennsylvania on Saturday, a conservative Republican judge shot down the Trump campaign’s biggest legal effort in the state with a scathing ruling that questioned why he was supposed to disenfranchise 7 million voters with no evidence to back their claims and an inept legal argument at best.


  But the lawyers still hope to block the state’s certification, quickly appealing to the 3rd US Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia, which ordered lawyers to file a brief on Monday but did not agree to hear oral arguments.


  The campaign, in its filings, asked for urgent consideration so it could challenge the state election results before they are certified next month. If not, they will seek to decertify them, the filings said.


  Mr Biden won Pennsylvania by more than 80,000 votes.


  Pennsylvania county election boards voted on Monday, the state deadline, on whether to certify election results to the Department of State.

And it was Breckner who placed an emphatic right hand upon Bishop Feehan’s quest for the CCL Cup by making a diving stab of a Crusader drive on their fourth penalty kick to provide the Shamrocks with an insurmountable, and title-taking, 3-1 advantage in the shootout.
 Breckner blanked the Crusaders through the final 58 minutes of regulation and then two five-minute sudden-victory overtime periods after the two sides had played to a 2-2 standoff after 80 minutes.
 Breckner had 11 shutouts during the season, with Bishop Feehan having allowed merely two goals through its first 13 matches of the season before taking on Bishop Fenwick. The script to the CCL championship took an unexpected turn and twist when the Crusaders matched that season total of goals allowed by the Shamrocks within the first 22 minutes of their match, stunning the Shamrocks in taking a 2-0 lead.
 Bishop Feehan coach Phil Silva had scouted Bishop Fenwick’s CCL semifinal round match against Austin Prep, which was also decided in an overtime shootout. Silva’s report back to Bishop Feehan in its preparation for the Crusaders and its impact upon the outcome placed Breckner in position to serve the Shamrocks well.
 “We had the first four shooters in terms of what they did the other night,” Silva said. “I said that they’re going to go to your left on the first three and the fourth kid is going to go up the middle.”
 Breckner denied the first two Crusader shooters, who let loose ground-hugging shots right at her torso, shots that were destined for the lower left corner. The third Crusader shooter did connect with a drive to the left. The Shamrocks had already gained a 2-0 edge by that time as both Francesca Yanchuk and Kaitryn Franchino had labeled their shots into the back of the Bishop Fenwick net. Shamrock sophomore Bri Marrero went to the spot for Bishop Feehan’s third penalty kick and was successful as well, creating a 3-1 advantage.
 The fourth Crusader shooter also went left, but Breckner alertly came off of her spot, dove to her right, and got her right hand on the drive to knock it away and secure the Shamrock championship.
 “She still had to make the decision to do it,” Silva said of Breckner. “The fourth one, she (Breckner) made a hard save, the kid (from Bishop Fenwick) hit a hard ball.”
 Breckner has always been a soccer player, but she began her musical journey in earnest in the sixth grade. She is a member of various Bishop Feehan musical and drama clubs, participating in many a presentation.
 “But that was the first time that I sang the national anthem in public,” Breckner said after not having been called out of the stands to sing prior to any Bishop Feehan football or basketball games. “I found out Friday, they had reached out to the Jazz Choir and asked if there were any singers that wanted to do it. It’s my senior year, I might as well do it.”
 Breckner had completed a few rehearsal renditions of the national anthem and gained accolades for her range of voice and depth in her delivery prior to Saturday’s kickoff.
 Breckner had not experienced any pressure in penalty kick situations throughout the course of the 2020 season in goal for the Shamrocks as Bishop Feehan had routinely decided the outcomes of most matches (save for a 1-1 standout with Bishop Stang) by halftime. And even during the course of the 2019 season, Breckner was never forced to hold the line in goal for a shootout.

  # Average Thanksgiving meal cost down again


  Richard Bogren


  LSU Ag Center


  2020 may go down in history as one of the most uncertain and crazy years ever, but for the American Farm Bureau Federation’s annual cost survey of classic items found on the Thanksgiving Day dinner table, “the show must go on.”


  This survey was started in 1986 and is highly anticipated by the media and consumers each year, said AgCenter nutrition agent Quincy Vidrine, who has been counting the cost of our favorite holiday meal for many years.


  Some good news for 2020 is that the national average total of Thanksgiving dinner is the lowest since 2010, and Louisiana prices are on pace to follow that trend as well, Vidrine said.


  The national average cost of Thanksgiving dinner comes in this year at $46.90 and the average cost in Louisiana comes in at $46.24 — 66 cents lower.


  “For the past six years, Louisiana has come in under the national average cost by at least $1.00 or so,” she said.


  The price of turkey is significantly lower, while other staples in the dinner vary in price. Holiday foods included in the survey are turkey, stuffing, sweet potatoes, rolls with butter, peas, cranberries, a veggie tray, pumpkin pie with whipped cream, and coffee and milk. The quantities are enough to serve 10 people while providing plenty of leftovers.


  The AgCenter survey took place both in-store and online in central Louisiana.


  “Most of the items included in a traditional Thanksgiving meal were plentiful, and shelves were well stocked with staples,” Vidrine said.


  Specialty items and variety were lacking due to fluctuations in supply as both health concerns and weather events impeded the normal course of business, she said.


  In light of the pandemic, consumers may want to err on the side of caution and forgo the annual Thanksgiving meal shopping trip. They can still take advantage of the many sales and promotions being offered as well as use pick- up and delivery options, she said.


  Vidrine suggests going online to review the circulars and decide what will be the best deal for you and your family.


  “Do you really need a turkey that feeds 10 people when you will just be feeding the members of your immediate household? Maybe not,” she said. “Perhaps a small turkey breast would suffice.”


  Restaurants, grocery stores and specialty meat markets are making accommodations for those who are leery of getting out and offering delivery and no-contact pick-up options.


  “While these services may cost a little more, they may be just what you need to stay safe,” Vidrine said.


  One thing is for sure: Thanksgiving is going to look a lot different this year, perhaps with smaller groups and virtual gatherings.


  “But giving thanks on this special day is still the reason we come together as families, and also as a nation,” Vidrine said.

  # Peoria Public Schools buildings prepare to close until mid-January


  Scott Hilyard


  Journal Star


  PEORIA — Tuesday is the last day of in-school learning for the students in Peoria Public Schools until mid-January.


  In the past two weeks the district had tinkered with different schedules, but has settled on remote learning for all grades starting Wednesday until at least Tuesday, Jan. 19.


  The November spike in local COVID-19 cases prompted PPS to go into the full retreat provision of its Return to School Plan.


  "(The situation) is changing quickly, but right now everything is in the red," Superintendent Sharon Desmoulin-Kherat reported to one physically present board member Monday night and six present by telephone. "I checked before I came here and positivity (rate) was 14.3%. Cases are super high. Every thing is super high.


  The planned remote learning schedule includes several weeks of planned time off. Students are off from Wednesday, Thursday and Friday for Thanksgiving Break. Remote learning will begin Monday, Nov. 30 and run until Friday, Dec. 18. Winter Break runs from Dec. 21 to Jan. 4, with remote learning resuming on Jan. 5 and running until Jan. 19, the Tuesday after Martin Luther King Day.


  At this point, the plan is to bring students back to in-school learning on Jan.19. That includes the return for high school students for the first time since schools were initially closed statewide on March 17.


  Board member Dan Walther expressed concern about the return to remote learning for the district's youngest learners. Students in kindergarten through fourth grad were the first students to return to in-school learning in October, in part because remote learning was more challenging for that age group.


  "Five hours of screen time didn't work," Walther said.


  Nicole Wood, the district executive director fo primary education said computer screen time would be reduced for the younger students. She said there would be more pre-planned projects in reading and writing and more.


  "We do limit screen time for the youngest learners," Wood said. "The teachers have really personalized instruction for (that age group)."and

Four years later, it's safe to say that the Trump strategy has not succeeded. There have been a few small victories, of course, like the "phase one" trade deal that the U.S. and China inked late last year. But those wins are small potatoes compared to the overwhelming costs of Trump's go-it-alone strategy, which has foisted billions of dollars of tariff costs on American importers and consumers. The administration has spent $28 billion bailing out farmers hurt by the trade war—a massive self-inflicted wound. And that doesn't even get into the other damage caused by Trump's haphazard escalations of trade tensions with longtime U.S. allies.

GREAT BEND -- Anyone who knows a senior citizen in Barton, Pawnee, Rush, Stafford, Kiowa and Pratt counties who could benefit from a special giving tree project is encouraged to contact ElderCare in Great Bend.
   
 "Anyone who receives home services in these counties is eligible to have a place on our tree," said Brandi Gruber, executive director of ElderCare. "Our caregivers offer suggestions because they are our eyes and ears when they visit clients' homes.
   
 Gruber acknowledged that she was uncertain about pursuing the ElderCare Giving Tree project this year in light of the coronavirus pandemic. But said she realized that the non-profit agency's home-services clients deserve a special gift especially during this difficult time.
   
 "It is important, now more than ever, to share the Christmas spirit with one another," Gruber said. "A lot of older folks are not getting out at all because of COVID and we want to find ways to put smiles on their faces."
   
 The 2020 Giving Tree, now available at the ElderCare office, 1121 Washington, Great Bend, has been trimmed with decorative tags that represent clients and their particular needs. Actual names are not used because of privacy concerns.
   
 "Choosing a tag will be a bit different this year," Gruber said. "Those who want to come into our office should call for an appointment. This will allow us to limit the number of people here at any one time."
   
 Donors may also call 620-792-5942 or email bgruber@eldercareks.org.
   
 "We are more than happy to accommodate anyone who wants to make the season a little brighter for our clients," Gruber said.
   
 Gifts should be returned to the ElderCare office by Dec. 14. They will be delivered by ElderCare care-givers.
   
 This is the fourth year for the local ElderCare Giving Tree project. More than 60 gifts were collected the first year; 90 the second; and 100 last year. The tree provides much-needed items to senior citizens who are short on finances and have limited mobility.
   
 "Many seniors, especially at Christmastime, need to know their neighbors are thinking about them," Gruber said. "They need some basic items and we encourage businesses and individuals to take on the role of Santa Claus."
   
 Gifts could include blankets, warm clothing, toiletry items, crossword-puzzle and word-search books, and gift cards for a few staples at the grocery store.
   
 "We also want to ensure that each gift package includes something fun," Gruber said. "It might be a favorite candy or food item specific to each recipient."
   
 ElderCare's home services include personal care, household tasks and respite for caregivers. Registered nurses offer medication management, wellness checks and companionship. The organization currently serves more than 350 clients in the prescribed area.

The 17.1, though, does remain significantly higher than the 7 per 100,000 Tulare County needs to move into the red tier. Tulare County's official case rate, which should be updated today, was last reported last Monday at 17.6 per 100,000.
 Tulare County meets the other standards to move from the most restrictive tier, purple, to the next least restrictive tier, red. Its last official overall positive test rate was reported at 7.1 percent, which is below the 8 percent threshold to move into the red tier.
 Tulare County's equity metric positive test rate for its most disadvantaged areas was at 5.6 percent, which also well within the red tier standard.
 It will still be a while before Tulare County can move into the red tier. When it does meet all the standards, Tulare County must maintain those numbers for two weeks to move into the red tier. Restaurants can then open indoors at 25 percent capacity, churches can open indoors at 25 percent capacity, movie theaters can open on a limited basis and schools can reopen to all students.
 As far as schools, Springville's waiver to open for grades K-6, which has been approved by the county, is still being reviewed by the state.
 Woodville's waiver is still being reviewed by the county. Burton School District and Porterville Unified School District has been cleared to reopen for grades K-6.
 Burton School District has set a tentative reopening date of January 11. PUSD hopes to open up to three elementary schools a couple weeks before the Christmas break.
 After virtually no increase of active cases was reported on Friday, Tulare County. While the increase in cases wasn't as high as it has been before virtually no increase was reported on Friday, it was still a significant increase.
 The number of active cases increased by 72 over the weekend or 24 a day. There are now 1,099 people in Tulare County who have COVID-19.
 The overall increase in cases was 209 over the weekend or about 70 per day. Since March 11 there have been 19,882 cases in Tulare County.

Nokia is heading to the moon, though not until 2022. In late October, the company announced it had landed a contract with NASA to "build and deploy the first ultra-compact, low-power, space-hardened, end-to-end LTE solution on the lunar surface in late 2022." The idea is for Nokia to establish a 4G cellular network in order to facilitate communications among astronauts on the moon as part of NASA's Artemis program -- the goal of which is to land another astronaut on the moon by 2024.

_The Wall Street Journal_reports that the latest Trump administration plan to confront China's unfair trade practices seeks to "create an informal alliance of Western nations to jointly retaliate when China uses its trading power to coerce countries." If China boycotts imports—as it recently did to Australian coal—or otherwise applies economic pressure to a trading partner, the allied nations would be able to execute a coordinated response. An unnamed administration official tells the paper that "the West needs to create a system of absorbing collectively the economic punishment from China's coercive diplomacy and offset the cost."

Indeed, the government's proposed budgets for new hydrogen and CCS infrastructure have come under fire from green groups in the days following Number 10's announcement of its much-vaunted 10 point climate plan. Critics were quick to point out last week that the UK's financial provisions for hydrogen pales in comparison to the budgets unveiled by France and Germany this year - where €7bn and €9bn, respectively, has been earmarked for supporting new hydrogen infrastructure. Meanwhile, the £200m increase in CCS funding that took the budget up to £1bn simply returned promised spending to a level previously announced a decade ago under the coalition government, before support for a CCS demonstration project was controversially axed.

A solid 40.4 percent of New York (mostly "upstate" and Staten Island in the New York City) voters used their ballots to demonstrate their solid support for a racist who denies climate change, and today has the blood of more than 250,000 innocent Americans on his hands for failing to lead the country through the COVID-19 pandemic.

For the modest price of $250,000, your dreams of exploring the stars can come true, courtesy of Virgin Galactic. Founded by Sir Richard Branson, the idea behind Virgin Galactic is simple: provide space tourists with a ride beyond the atmosphere. Unfortunately, that's easier said than done, especially during a pandemic. In mid-November, the company announced it had to postpone a test flight out of its New Mexico-based Spaceport due to new virus-related restrictions. Without more tests, Virgin Galactic will have to continue to delay sending paying customers into space, and the test flight was supposed to contain a NASA payload that would've brought the company a nice payday. Virgin Galactic still has $742 million in cash as of the third quarter, and it still hopes to put passengers into space by 2021. That said, at this point, while Virgin Galactic is one of the best space stocks to watch, it's still a moonshot.

Passing the bill will be the first legislative challenge for Kuwait's new emir, Sheikh Nawaf Al Ahmad Al Sabah. Sheikh Nawaf ascended the throne in September following the death of the 91-year-old Sheikh Sabah Al Ahmad Al Sabah, a seasoned diplomat who over 14 years made his tiny state a respected regional mediator.
 Incoming lawmakers after Kuwait's Dec. 5 election will decide the public debt bill's fate, and it won't be an easy sell.
 "The whole system is corrupt," said Omar al-Tabtabaee, an independent lawmaker running for reelection. "There's corruption in our projects, in how they choose civil servants. No Kuwaiti is happy about our situation."
 Earlier this year, al-Tabtabaee rejected a plan to raise Kuwait's debt ceiling, along with a majority of lawmakers who feared the fresh revenue would line the pockets of wealthy merchants and foreign banks.
 "People have lost their trust in the government," said Mohammed al-Yousef, an independent Kuwaiti political analyst. "There have been so many scandals and not one minister is in prison."
 The scandals include a scheme that looted billions of dollars from a Malaysian sovereign wealth fund, ensnaring a member of Kuwait's ruling family. Another smuggled Bangladeshi laborers into the country with the alleged help of lawmakers. Last year, the Cabinet resigned over accusations that hundreds of millions of dollars were missing from a military fund.
 Now ministers are struggling to convince an increasingly resentful public. The former finance minister, Mariam al-Aqeel, left her post in February after coming under fire for suggesting the government close its deficit by taxing citizens and cutting salaries. Six Finance Ministry officials resigned last month in what was seen as a bid to drive out the current minister, who has pushed hard for the debt law.
 The resistance stems from Kuwait's decades-old social contract. Scaling back the bloated welfare state alters a system in which cradle-to-grave benefits buy loyalty -- a recipe for unrest without concessions from the top.
 "Kuwaitis think, why would I contribute my own money if the government isn't holding anyone accountable? If I can't see where their money is going?" said Barrak Algharabally, an expert in government budgeting at Kuwait University.
 As Kuwait quarrels, available cash is dwindling. For the first time in history, oil revenues won't cover salaries and subsidies, which have swelled since 2006 and now eat up more than 70% of the national budget. At current oil prices and spending levels, the general reserve fund will dry up by December, said Raghu Mandagolathur, research director at the Kuwait Financial Center, an investment bank.
 Even when the virus recedes, oil prices aren't expected to soar to 2014 peaks of over $100 a barrel. Experts say the pandemic has given Kuwait a glimpse of the future, jolting the country out of the assumption it can live beyond its means forever. But whether the shock will force much-needed reforms remains to be seen.
 "We'll have fun for the next 10, 20 years, but what's next?" asked Algharabally, the budgeting expert. "What will happen to our sons and grandsons?"

MULLINVILLE -- The Old School Antique Mall in Mullinville has been around for six years, with Susan Clayton at the helm since November 2018. Doris Headrick and a group of her friends started the antique mall in 2014 after recognizing they had a special affinity for not only the antiques they collected, but also the building which houses their shop, an unused schoolhouse in the small, western-Kansas town.
   
 The Old School Antique Mall, located in the old high school building, is not used anymore as K-12 students from Mullinville attend consolidated Kiowa County Schools in Greensburg. The antique mall spans three rooms formerly used for economics, science and music classes. Headrick said people come through the building and say "I used to cook here" or "I used to go to band in this room." It's a place with many good memories for a lot of their visitors.
   
 "I think having the mall in our old high school is very important to our community," said Clayton. "It's so much better for the building to be occupied than just sitting empty."
   
 Mall vendors are able to arrange their items in a rented space. They are responsible for pricing and displaying their items, but do not have to be there when the store is open on Saturdays and Sundays from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Clayton teaches at Haviland Grade School during the week, which limits her availability.
   
 "My vendors are amazing and provide so many unusual, unique and interesting items," Clayton said. "I have been exposed to so many beautiful and intriguing items here. It's my favorite place to shop!"
   
 Some of her favorite items that come through are milk bottles, milk cans, and ice cream tins from Gardiner's Dairy in Garden City.
   
 "My great-grandfather acquired this dairy in the 1920s from his brother, and it remained a family business until 1972," said Clayton. "My first job was working in the dairy's office in the 1960s, so to purchase these items, from various vendors now, is very special to me."
   
 Clayton and her late husband taught junior high classes in the school-turned- antique-mall building. Her current husband's grandfather used his team of horses to slope the floor in the auditorium. Her mother-in-law graduated there in the late 40s from Mullinville High School.
   
 The building will be 100-years-old in 2025. Clayton said she is thankful for the dedication of the Mullinville Recreation Board, which owns the building and maintains and makes repairs as necessary.
   
 "I'm amazed at how people from all over the country are in awe of the beauty of the old building and enjoy just touring the building," said Clayton. "I enjoy the comments and it's exciting when former students come back to visit."

Essentially a must-own stock for any massive fund -- and also an extremely well-run and profitable company -- Apple stock is far and away the largest single holding in Berkshire's portfolio. Berkshire's more than $115 billion stake in Apple amounts for about 46% of Berkshire's total portfolio. Although Buffett's conglomerate sold about $4.4 billion in AAPL shares last quarter, that's peanuts compared to its total stake, and it was likely done simply to take some profits and rebalance.

“We put some adjustments in there (for the second half) to try to make it harder, but some of it, they made plays. Overall, better execution in the first half would have helped us out. They did a good job of pushing off and running away from our leverage and Watson was doing a good job of finding them (receivers).”
 Houston’s totaled 274 net yards in the first half, collecting 16 first downs and 21 points with Watson engineering two second quarter TD drives.
 The Patriots limited the Texans to 125 net yards on four second half series.
 “Especially going against a mobile quarterback like that, it’s going to take 11 guys,” Phillips said. “The cover guys are going to have to cover two or three seconds longer than they’re used to. When he wants to throw the ball, you need all 11 guys to get there and there was a lot of yards after contact. We have to do a better job defensively of knocking them back and getting off of the field.”
 Overall, New England gained more yards (435) than Houston, had more first downs (22) and five more minutes (32-27) of possession time while not committing a turnover for the third consecutive game.
 “Watson made some good throws,” cornerback Stephon Gilmore said in his return to the lineup after a three-week absence due to injury. “He extended the plays, he bided time. We had to make it hard on him, but that’s why he’s a good quarterback.”
 The lack of a consistent and strong pass rush on Watson did not create one sack of Watson.
 “Those are the choices you got to make,” Patriots coach Bill Belichick said of pressuring or defending Watson. “They have done pretty well against pressure – they got a lot of good receivers, they got a good quarterback. We mixed it in there some, but they did a pretty good job with all of it, to tell you the truth.”
 New England had been playing reasonably sound defense, ranking No. 13 overall in the NFL in yards allowed per game (353) and ranked No. 10 in passing defense (224 yards per game).
 “it’s a team game, we don’t point fingers," Gilmore said. “It’s always one or two plays here or there that you have to finish to come out with a win.
 “It’s always disappointing when you don’t win. We have to watch the film and correct the things that we didn’t do well because the next team (Arizona with QB Kyler Murray Sunday in Foxboro) is going to do the same thing.”

Although it's a relatively small part of the Berkshire pie, this is likely a starter position that will be prone to grow over time.

 # Jim Martin: A smaller gathering at Thanksgiving calls for making adjustments
 Erie Times-News
 You probably know a family that has struggled to make mealtime adjustments when the kids move out or go off to college.
 That favorite recipe that used to make enough for seconds and leftovers for the next day can become laughably large when the size of the household is reduced by two or three people.
 My household, like millions across the country, finds itself planning for a downsized Thanksgiving celebration as cases of COVID-19 continue to surge.
 In our family, that means the mealtime head count will fall this year from 32 to nine.
 A larger collection of siblings, nieces, nephews, uncles, cousins and friends and significant others of all of the above will be missed this year as we sit down to eat.
 Now, I get it. Nine is still a big number, a substantial gathering by most accounts. But I don't feel like we are making the needed adjustments for the meal that will be served this year at my daughter's and son-in-law's house.
 Holiday menu planning in our household has always been focused on the desire to provide abundance on the table and enough food to be hospitable if a tour bus full of hungry Canadian shoppers broke down outside.
 Seriously. I don't think anyone ever eats as much as they contemplate eating on Thanksgiving, but there's always enough, after sending guests home with bags and containers of leftovers, to eat for a couple of more days.
 As we plan dinner for a smaller crowd, the meal planners among us are saying all the right things. But I'm not sure we mean them.
 I can't say this for sure, but what I'm hearing is that the cooks in our family, me included, seem focused on making a third less food for 23 fewer people. My oldest daughter, for one, worries that 10 pounds of mashed potatoes won't be enough. Her sisters seem intent on making prodigious amounts of sweet potatoes and loaves of cranberry bread.
 A little less than usual, but not much.
 Out of habit, I suppose, I reached for the largest turkey I could find in the grocery store over the weekend. I note for the record that exactly three of the nine people expected to attend do more than tolerate turkey.
 And that brings us to the pies. The list apparently has been narrowed to include peach, raspberry, pecan and pumpkin. And if one makes pumpkin pie, local ordinance apparently prohibits making fewer than two.
 In short, I fear that old habits will die hard and that our refrigerator will runneth over with leftovers.
 In a year of adjustments, downsizing dinner is just the latest challenge.

Nachdem die Bachelor-Arbeit im Mai abgegeben war, wollten die beiden eigentlich wieder verreisen. „Der Plan war, in die Mongolei zu trampen“, sagt Leon Schleep.

Gemüseanbau habe die beiden im Studium am meisten interessiert und so begaben sie sich auf die Suche nach einer geeigneten Fläche für ihr Vorhaben. „Die Region war dabei gar nicht so klar, aber das Eichsfeld empfanden wir schon als sehr attraktiv.“ Also fragten sie bei den Gemeinden rund um Witzenhausen nach. In Dietzenrode kam dann der Kontakt mit dem dortigen Inselhof zustande.
 Das anschließende Treffen in dem landwirtschaftlichen Familienbetrieb, der sich seit 1994 der ökologischen Landwirtschaft verschrieben hat, war fruchtbar im wahrsten Sinne des Wortes.

ADRIAN -- The end of the 2019-20 season for the Adrian College men's hockey team came not via a heartbreaking loss in either a conference or national postseason game, but via a phone call to head coach Adam Krug from athletic director Mike Duffy.
   
 The winter postseason came to a stop due to the coronarvius pandemic, and it would never get going again, leaving the team feeling like it's destiny had been snatched up from them.
   
 This season, Krug and this year's iteration of the Bulldogs are determined to make up for lost time and despite having to battle to find opponents at the moment, the goal is still the same as its been since Krug played for that first squad under Ron Fogarty in the 2007-08 season.
   
 "The expectation is to compete for a national title, if there is one," Krug said. "For sure a Harris Cup is not out of the picture and we gotta be ready to compete and ready to go for it. It always is with this program and it always will be, and if it's not, I probably won't be the coach anymore. I think the expectations are high even with 10-11 freshmen, 12 newcomers all together, we're showing already that we're capable of some good stuff, and the fact that we're playing, I think we have a head start on all the other Division III teams in the country, for when we do get there, we won't have to figure out our identity because we know our identity and now it's just a matter of putting it together."
   
 Last year's squad, which finished with a final mark of 21-5-3, including a 15-3-2 mark in Northern Collegiate Hockey Association play, was one of the most senior-laden teams that AC had in Krug's tenure, with a full third (eight of its 24) being in their last season of collegiate hockey, including the leading goal scorer and point tallier from 2019-20, Dino Balsamo (19 goals and 21 assists for 40 points in 29 games).
   
 In that area, this year's team is a stark contrast to last year squad, as it only has two seniors, goaltender Cameron Gray, who figures in to get the lions share of the starts for Adrian and tallied a career-high 40 saves in Saturday's 5-0 loss to NCAA Division I Bowling Green State University, and associate captain and defenseman Joshua Owings out of Saline.
   
 That's not to say that Adrian is lacking in the experience department.
   
 Along with Gray and Owings, they are joined by eight returning juniors, headed up by the team's captain Matt Eller at left defense, and associate captain Sam Ruffin at forward, and is not lacking in the scoring department either, as it returns three of last year's five leading scorers, topped by junior Andrew Bellant (17 goals, 21 assists in 2019-20) and Ruffin, who had a team-high 27 assists to go with 10 goals last year, along with sophomore Alessio Luciani (10 goals, 22 assists in 2019-20).
   
 Even with the limited amount of games, the newcomers to Adrian have already began to impress Krug and the coaching staff, such as freshman forward Connor May, who has four goals so far this season, defensemen Jacob Breckles, Dominic Loubert, Jaden Shields and Chase Spencer and goaltender Dershahn Stewart, who was in line for a start in a game against Trine on Nov. 14 before that game was postponed, along with junior forward Zach Goberis, a transfer from the ACHA Division II club at MSU-Denver has been solid so far.
   
 "(Goberis) has been a nice addition for us so far," Krug said. "He can play center or wing, gives us some nice depth at the center position, and plays in all situations, penalty kill or powerplay as well, he had two assists last game at BG, which was nice."
   
 Despite the team's 2-2 record and sporting a 13-15 goals-for/against ratio through its first four games, that record doesn't tell the whole story for Adrian.
   
 With so few teams playing at the moment, Krug and company have had to pull opponents from wherever they could get them. The two wins the Bulldogs have grabbed were against fellow NCHA member Trine by scores of 5-3 and 6-1, and looking for teams, Adrian grabbed the second and third games it has ever played against an NCAA Division I opponent in Bowling Green, and while losing both of those by a combined 11-2, it has given both sides much needed game experience while the teams look for other opponents.
   
 Currently, Adrian has no opponents scheduled from Saturday's game against the Falcons at Arrington Ice Arena until an exhibition against the U.S. Under-18 team on January 10 and then a twinbill against Trine on Jan. 29-30, thanks to a twinbill against Utica this coming weekend being canceled and a game against Trine on Dec. 4 being postponed.
   
 "We've got some calls trying to pick up some games for next weekend and potentially the weekend after. I don't think our guys want to go home, I think they want to stay the course and keep getting better," Krug said. "If we go home now, it's gonna be a six, seven week break, and we definitely don't want that, our guys don't want that. I don't think it's the healthy thing for them and I don't think it's the safe thing for them, to be honest. I want them here where they have structure and are doing things on a daily basis together safely."

"For many parents, holidays mean sharing special rituals across different generations and opportunities for children to connect with grandparents, cousins and other relatives," Clark said. "Our report suggests that while many children have spent less time with relatives during the pandemic, some parents may have a hard time foregoing holiday gatherings in order to reduce COVID-19 risks."
 Meanwhile, 75% of respondents said they "also believe it's important to prevent the spread of COVID-19 at family gatherings."
 That's because nine in 10 parents reported that their Thanksgiving celebrations usually include grandparents, who infectious diseases experts say are more at risk of contracting, being hospitalized with and dying from COVID-19.
 For those families that still plan on gathering this week despite expert warnings, 88% said they won't allow members who have COVID-19 symptoms or have been exposed to the virus to attend, the survey found, while 64% said they will exclude members who don't follow COVID-19 precautions and 68% said they will ask guests to socially distance.
 A sizable majority (76%) of parents also said they will try to limit contact between children and high-risk guests, although Clark warns this may be easier said than done.
 "It may be difficult to maintain distance between children and high risk adults throughout a multiday visit or even during a lengthy dinner," Clark said. "Parents should be realistic about how feasible it will be to limit contact and think carefully about whether to gather in person with high-risk family members."
 The researchers suggest parents should ask cousins and other school-aged family members whether they are attending in-person classes or activities, "given the differences in local and state regulations," the release reads.
 "If they are, there should be specific questions about how well COVID-19 precautions are consistently followed," they wrote.
 Conversations with children about the importance of wearing a mask and social distancing should also happen prior to Thanksgiving Day, the researchers said. Clark recommends kids spend most of their time outdoors.
 Parents might want to talk about "proper 'voice etiquette' by limiting singing or yelling, as these actions can more easily spread viruses," the researchers advise.

But there is just one more unnecessary hurdle to surmount.
 America and the world have to survive the roughly two months that this I-me- mine zealot is still in office. This guy actually thinks he’s going to undermine our Constitution with, as the late Warren Zevon said, “lawyers, guns, and money.” He actually thinks he can litigate a free election to his favor. He has told militia groups to “stand back and stand by” and is spending a ton of his donors’ money on lawyers to try to accomplish this.
 Even though he has the emotional maturation of a 9-year-old, he still got just less than half of the American votes in the election. He still enjoys, with a few exceptions, the support of the Republican party even though he is trying to dismantle the Constitution right in front of their lily-livered eyes. It makes me wonder what makes them drink his Kool-Aid? What playground did his supporters as children play in where a loud-mouthed bully who takes your money and lets everyone else take the fall, is a good guy? Growing up with the East Side Park as my playground I can’t help but think he would have been going down the slide unconscious.

Jay Pithwa's dream of a bar where humans can enjoy a drink and dogs can run freely under one roof in Gaston County is within a month of reality.
   
 That dream was to open Gaston County's first dog bar - a concept that has stuck and grown in Charlotte in recent years - and bring new life to north Belmont around Woodlawn Street, just outside of Belmont city limits.
   
 The Thirsty Dog will be the first business to occupy abandoned Roper's shopping center in at least 25 years, according to Pithwa, who also owns Tastebuds Popcorn in downtown Belmont.
   
 After gallons of blood, sweat and tears, Pithwa, 46, expects the family- friendly business to open before the New Year.
   
 "It is very exciting," he said. "We can't describe how the light at the end of the tunnel is starting to feel."
   
 'An uphill struggle'
   
 Pithwa and business partner Gene Kropfelder, with help from Pithwa's fiance Jen Colangelo, initially expected to open The Thirsty Dog in 2019 - long before the pandemic was a concern. But every possible hurdle that could've come up pushed progress back a year and a half.
   
 "We started from scratch, and of course COVID-19 did not help one bit," Pithwa said. "It's been an uphill struggle."
   
 The 26,000-square-feet building, located next to North Belmont Elementary, largely lacked plumbing and needed substantial upgrades to its roof and wiring before Pithwa and Kropfelder could begin installing bar equipment, high-top tables and other furnishings.
   
 After making reductions to their budget, they set out to complete the renovation without a general contractor to oversee the renovation.
   
 But without a general contractor, county building inspection officials were slow to give advice throughout construction without scheduling an inspection, according to Pithwa.
   
 "For a place that literally has a bar, fridge, tables, chairs, a fence and two restrooms, I don't know why it took almost two years for this," Pithwa said. "It should have taken six months."
   
 The 58-year-old building wasn't exactly the best canvas to start with, said Brian Sciba, director of building inspections for Gaston County. On top of all the improvements needed to move into the building, it needed rezoning and a conditional use permit.
   
 "It had a lot of issues. They had to run the whole gamut," Sciba said. "There were hearings on top of hearings."
   
 Sciba was happy to see Pithwa and Kropfelder hold fast to the project.
   
 "I was actually glad that they stuck it out and got through the process because that building's been an eye-sore on that community for decades now," Sciba said.
   
 Then came the pandemic. Because The Thirsty Dog didn't open before the initial state shutdown, Pithwa said the business couldn't apply for any loans or state assistance.
   
 Despite the hurdles to get The Thirsty Dog off the ground, Pithwa and Kropfelder remain optimistic about their bold vision for north Belmont.
   
 A new destination in Gaston County
   
 Together, Pithwa and Kropfelder own Roper's and the shopping center across the street. Since last year, they've self-branded the buildings as NoBel, short for north Belmont.
   
 The duo continues to market the remaining 21,000 square-feet of space to breweries, restaurants and art studios.
   
 "Like NoDa (Charlotte), we want to make it a destination. Not just for someone to grab a drink. Say you don't have a dog, or say if you don't drink. There will still be other reasons to come out," Pithwa said.
   
 Several prospective tenants have visited the NoBel plaza, but no one has yet to pull the trigger on any of the spaces.
   
 "I think [they're thinking], 'let's see how this one does and go from there.' This is the first unique thing of its kind in Gaston County," Kropfelder said.
   
 The Thirsty Dog and the adjoining space sits on nearly three acres. Pithwa hopes to eventually utilize the outdoor space behind the building for volleyball, fire pits and outdoor seating and enclose it all with cypress trees.
   
 "It'll be like its own little oasis," he said.
   
 The Thirsty Dog, designated as a private club under North Carolina law, certainly doesn't land short of space, beer taps, tables and televisions.
   
 The business takes up roughly 5,000 square-feet of indoor space and features another 3,500 square-feet of outdoor space, partially covered by a heated awning, making it the largest place in Gaston County for people to relax and socialize while also enjoying an alcoholic beverage.
   
 "People just want to be outside," Pithwa said. "Other than the Whitewater Center (Charlotte), there's nowhere else with this large of a facility where you can do that."
   
 Once every keg is tapped, customers will be able to select from 32 craft beers from the tap. Customers can grab their beer or craft cocktails, take a seat at the bar or one of the club's numerous high-top tables and cut their dog loose to play with others.
   
 Don't have a dog? Once opened, The Thirsty Dog plans to host live music, trivia and other entertainment, and there's 17 televisions throughout the business. Customers can also get involved with the The Thirsty Dog's beer club.
   
 Pub food was originally planned for The Thirsty Dog, but Pithwa has since focused on getting the bar up and running before taking on a full kitchen. Customers can look forward to food trucks stopping by the bar on select nights.
   
 Dog memberships are currently $36 a year but will increase in price, according to Pithwa.
   
 Dogs who enter the bar must be spayed/neutered and be up-to-date on vaccinations. Memberships for people 18 and up, separate from the dog memberships, are $10 a year.
   
 For pandemic safety, membership will be limited to 500 dogs and 2,000 humans. Memberships can be pre-ordered at ThirstyDogNC.com.
   
 Children can come to The Thirsty Dog, though they must be accompanied by a member and remain in the on-leash area.
   
 The Thirst Dog also hopes to collaborate with others in the dog industry.
