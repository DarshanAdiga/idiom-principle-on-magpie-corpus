 Godfrey told the club's official website: "It is an honour to sign for Everton and to be part of a huge club. I am very thankful for the opportunity and I can't wait to get started.
 "The aim for me at Everton is to win trophies and win games. I like to win. I wear my heart on my sleeve. I care and I am a passionate lad.
 "The fans can guarantee they will get 110 per cent out of me when I am on the pitch.
 "This is a club full of history that has an exciting team full of world-class players who will help me kick on to the next level. I am looking forward to working with them and, hopefully, having great times with Everton Football Club.
 "Carlo Ancelotti, Marcel Brands and the board want success for the club and it is really exciting to be here.
 "The manager's past speaks for itself. He has worked with some top-class centre-backs. I will be able to learn so much from him and he is going to help me get to that next level, which is where I want to be."
 Everton are sitting pretty at the summit after winning all four of their top- flight matches this season.

But Griffin was hardly the only one on the defense that stepped up this week. All-Pro linebacker Bobby Wagner had a season-high 12 tackles. His veteran partner K.J. Wright added eight -- two of which were bone-crushing hits to blow up screen passes -- and could have had _three_ interceptions. The Seahawks held the Dolphins to 1-3 in the red zone, and forced five consecutive field goals from the end of the first quarter to the fourth quarter. Griffin's game-sealing pick followed the fifth one.

The blessing is performed by _kohanim_ _,_ male Jews with priestly heritage who have a clear patrilineal tradition leading back to Aaron the high priest, brother of Moses. The priestly blessing is said daily during the year as part of the morning prayer service, and twice during Sabbath and holiday morning prayer services. Before saying the blessing, men from the tribe of Levi wash the hands of the _kohanim_. The ritual may only be performed by a _kohen_ and only in the presence of a quorum of ten Jews. A _kohen_ who is under the influence of alcohol or in mourning may not perform the blessing.
