The Supreme Court’s decision not to wade into the qualified immunity debate follows nationwide protests against racism and police brutality sparked by the death in Minnesota of George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man who died May 25 while being restrained by a white officer.
 In Congress, a bill introduced by House Democrats in the wake of Floyd's death would make it easier for injured individuals to claim damages in civil suits against police offices. The White House, however, has said that provision is a nonstarter and not likely to be part of a Senate Republican bill that's in the works.
 The push for the court to reexamine qualified immunity has come both from the left and right, including Thomas, a conservative, and Justice Sonia Sotomayor, a liberal. In 2018, when the court said that an Arizona police officer who shot a knife-wielding woman four times was immune from being sued, Sotomayor said the decision “sends an alarming signal to law enforcement officers and the public.”
 Since then, the court has been asked to take a number of different cases involving qualified immunity. Some of the cases the court rejected Monday were filed at the court more than a year ago and many others had been pending for months, before Floyd's death and the protests it prompted. The incidents themselves that sparked the lawsuits go back years and in some cases almost a decade.

This newspaper had reported earlier how the day was going to be split into two sessions -- one for bikes and the other for cars -- and how track officials were planning to stick to every regulation mandated by the central government. Among the racers who took to the track on the day were bikers from the Honda Racing Academy. Vicky Chandhok, former Federation of Motor Sports Clubs of India (FMSCI) president and current vice president of the Madras Motor Sports Club (MMSC) which operates the MMRT, said that everything went as planned. "Things went really well," Chandhok said. "We had twenty four bikes and ten cars. It went like clockwork. Everybody stuck to the rules. There were no additional vehicles or no support staff. Everyone brought their own handwash and sanitisers even though we have provided them as well."

Four months of political deadlock in Ireland have been broken with the agreement on a programme for government.
 The two centre-right parties Fianna Fail and Fine Gael, which emerged from opposing sides of Ireland's civil war in the 1920s, have held power since the formation of the state. But never at the same time.
 This will be the first time the two civil war parties will go into coalition together.
 The move comes after an inconclusive February 8 election, which saw Sinn Fein win the popular vote and its record number of seats in the Dail.
 But its attempts to form a left-wing coalition in the wake of the poll failed, after being unable to muster the numbers to secure the 80 seats needed for a majority.
 Both Fianna Fail and Fine Gael had repeatedly ruled out going into government with Sinn Fein, citing the party's links to the IRA and a clash in policies.
 Fianna Fail and Fine Gael required the Green Party to secure their own majority after the Labour Party and the Social Democrats ruled themselves out.
 Months of negotiations reached make or break point in recent days, as a government is needed imminently to pass new laws and to uphold a 6.5 billion euro package of support measures for businesses affected by Covid-19.
 Sections of emergency anti-terrorist and anti-organised crime gang legislation are set to lapse at the end of June if a new government is not formed.
 The Upper House of the Irish Parliament, known as the Seanad, needs to be in session to renew those laws.
 Senators were elected after the general election campaign, but it is up to the taoiseach of the new government to nominate 11 additional senators - which means there is added pressure to have a new head of government in place.
 The provisions of the Offences against the State Act and the Criminal Justice Amendment Act 2009 are renewed each year by the end of June through a motion in the Dail and the Seanad.
 If the laws are not renewed by June 30, then non-jury trials for certain offences will not be allowed to go ahead.
 Now that the deal has been agreed, it needs to be ratified by grassroots members from each party - however, each party has different rules.
 The Green Party requiring two-thirds support from their 2,700 members - a higher amount than the other parties which means a deal could yet be scuppered as some grassroots Green Party members have expressed concerns about going into a coalition with two large centre right parties and their commitment to reducing carbon emissions.
 Fianna Fail need a simple majority of its more than 15,000 members - some members have expressed concern about going into government with Fine Gael for the first time but its members are expected to pass it.
 Fine Gael have an electoral college system which gives the greater weight to its TDs, Senators and Councillors than the party membership.
 If it is passed by the various memberships, it is expected that a new government will be in place for the end of June or the first week of July.
 Fianna Fail leader Micheal Martin and outgoing Taoiseach and fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar are set to share a "rotating taoiseach" position, with Mr Martin taking the role for the first two years of the government.
 Green Party leader Eamon Ryan has ruled himself out for the role, but has not ruled out taking the deputy leader or tanaiste role.

If true, this would suggest an alternative, safer path to successful clinical intervention: Instead of adding proteins from young blood, which could do harm to a patient, the dilution of age-elevated proteins could be therapeutic, while also allowing for the increase of young proteins by removing factors that could suppress them.

There were many reasons for the Chargers' success that season, despite losing in the Divisional Round of the playoffs. Many could point to the success of their defense, particularly their defensive front. During the regular season, the Chargers tallied 39 total sacks, but a majority of those - 27 to be exact - came when they brought just four pass rushers. With players like Joey Bosa, Melvin Ingram, Issac Rochell and Uchenna Nwosu, along with a potential blitzer in Derwin James, the Chargers could get pressure with minimal rushers, allowing them to play with a numbers advantage in the secondary.

Now, Saba said, it's up to the police officers to step up and testify about what's really going on in their department.
 "We on the council have been fighting for two years for these people. They have been calling and emailing for two years," he said. "At some point, the members of the Police Department need to have the courage to stand up and work with him (Flynn) so he can do this audit properly. At this point, the audit is in the hands of every employee in the Police Department."
 During the Zoom meeting, Flynn answered questions about a range of issues, from civil service and hiring practices to union contracts and department policies.
 While he was unable to be specific, he promised the council that he would be thorough.
 "The mayor wants a clear-eyed evaluation of this essential public service," Flynn said. "There are a lot of political variables at play right now. This is a topical political issue and people inside and outside have expressed strong opinions about it."
 He added that the mayor "wants to be responsive to the public's concerns, but recognizes there are varying agendas out there."
 Among the many issues the group will look at, he said, include "the demographics of the city and the department, collective bargaining contracts, annual reports, the grant process and how it's being managed and audited, the budgetary process and how money is allocated."
 Due to coronavirus and travel restrictions, Flynn said he would not be traveling to Massachusetts until after restrictions are eased.
 The other members of the investigative team are in a similar situation, although they live closer to Methuen. For the time being, much of the group's work will be done remotely, poring over documents and gathering information before conducting face-to-face interviews with officers.
 "We will look at a wide variety of things and dig through the information, so when we do talk to people we have an understanding — do policies line up with practices?" he said.
 In addition to Flynn, other members of the group doing the audit include Keri Richardson, an analyst with CNA Corp., Deborah Friedl, retired superintendent of the Lowell Police Department, and Brenda Bond, Ph.D., a professor at Suffolk University in the Institute for Public Service.

El presidente del Congreso, Manuel Merino de Lama, aseguró que han iniciado una investigación para determinar si los integrantes del Parlamento disuelto, la Mesa Directiva anterior o si el personal administrativo de este poder del Estado cometió alguna irregularidad al haber aprobado y ejecutado el pago de una bonificación económica a favor de los excongresistas que ascendería a un monto total de S/ 600 mil. “Hemos sido sorprendidos. Tenemos que recordar las circunstancias en las que asumimos este Congreso. Los tiempos y la falta de personal no permitieron hacer una revisión de todos los acuerdos del interregno parlamentario”, aseguró Merino en conferencia de prensa acompañado por otros miembros de la Mesa Directiva. Este pronunciamiento se hizo luego que el excongresista Richard Arce publicara en sus redes sociales que el Congreso le depositó 5,200 soles en su cuenta personal pese a que ya no forma parte de ese poder del Estado desde la disolución del Legislativa, el pasado 30 de setiembre. “Esta mesa tomó la determinación de pedir una investigación profunda para ver cuál ha sido el personal que tuvo responsabilidad y, más aún, los recursos humanos que ya fueron cambiados, que hizo el seguimiento a cada una de las oficinas, a los pagos que han sido ajenos a esta administración”, añadió el actual presidente del Parlamento, quien no descartó la posibilidad de citar a miembros del Parlamento disuelto o de la anterior Mesa Directiva como parte del proceso. Manuel Merino reiteró que no se le podía atribuir a este Congreso o a la actual Mesa Directiva la decisión de pagar esta bonificación que ha sido defendida por el expresidente del Legislativo disuelto Pedro Olaechea. “No se puede involucrar a esta mesa en estos pagos que tenemos que analizar qué regularidad tuvieron. No hay que tomar acuerdos de mesa para respetar derechos laborales. Rechazamos que se haga esto a través de acuerdos de mesa”, insistió. Según Oleachea, el pago denunciado corresponde a una liquidación que les correspondía a los legisladores disueltos. “Sobre el tema de las bonificaciones que viene circulando, es importante señalar que el monto indicado corresponde al pago proporcional de la bonificación de Navidad que en su oportunidad no se incluyó en la liquidación de los congresistas cesados como consecuencia de la disolución del Congreso”, escribió en sus redes sociales. A su turno, el vicepresidente del Congreso, Guillermo Aliaga, aseguró que están haciendo una consulta con constitucionalistas sobre si es que el acuerdo de mesa que permitió el pago de esta bonoficación respeta la Carta Magna. “Se está evaluando respecto de la constitucionalidad de dichos acuerdos de mesa, 120 y 122. El Tribunal Constitucional ya estableció que fue bien disuelto el Congreso pasado y la propia sentencia del TC ha establecido que la Comisión Permanente funcionaba como un Congreso disminuido. No había Mesa Directiva y al no haber mesa, los acuerdos emanados de la misma, tal vez, y eso estamos revisando con constitucionalistas, podrían tener vicio de inconstitucionalidad”, manifestó.

SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) — Matt Shea is giving up his seat in the Washington House of Representatives, but he hasn't given up his dream of creating a 51st state out of the eastern half of the state. Shea spoke Saturday at a rally in Coeur d’Alene, Idaho, that featured many prominent figures in the far-right “patriot” movement. The Spokesman-Review reports that Shea vowed to continue pushing for the creation of a 51st state called Liberty, separate from liberal Seattle and the rest of western Washington. Shea says he wants to put on the issue on the ballot for this November in every county in eastern Washington. He also suggested that northern Idaho might be included in the new state. The Republican from Spokane Valley did not file for reelection this year after House Republican leaders ousted him from their caucus for his far-right activities. Shea spoke at an event dubbed “Liberate America” that drew several hundred people to the Kootenai County Fairgrounds. Other speakers included Idaho state Rep. Heather Scott, R-Blanchard; Ammon Bundy, whose family has led armed standoffs against federal agents in Oregon and Nevada; and Joey Gibson, who leads a far-right group called Patriot Prayer that’s known for provoking fights at public demonstrations in Portland, Oregon.

"There are two main interpretations of our original experiments: The first is that, in the mouse joining experiments, rejuvenation was due to young blood and young proteins or factors that become diminished with aging, but an equally possible alternative is that, with age, you have an elevation of certain proteins in the blood that become detrimental, and these were removed or neutralized by the young partners," said Irina Conboy, a professor of bioengineering at UC Berkeley who is the first author of the 2005 mouse- joining paper and senior author of the new study. "As our science shows, the second interpretation turns out to be correct. Young blood or factors are not needed for the rejuvenating effect; dilution of old blood is sufficient."

She had been interviewed only by local newspapers at that point, her parents Sirisha Bhumireddy and Bharat Gandhari explained. But Netflix producers familiar with the local coverage encouraged her to join their project.
 Ashrita’s parents said they were told right away that her vivaciousness and ease in front of a camera was what the film needed.
 The family recalls considering the offer for two days before agreeing to the once-in-a-lifetime Hollywood opportunity. They were surprised by lasting friendships formed with the filmmakers.
 “They were looking for someone who was a newcomer, who showed a lot of promise to do well at Scripps,” Ashrita’s mom said.
 Her father added, “The expectation was that at Scripps, she would perform well and make it to the top 40 or 50.”
 The whirlwind of filming happened over the course of three busy days, which would have been normal if not for the camera crew in tow.
 “We had just one chance at the interviews and everything, it was all impromptu,” Bhumireddy said. “The crew came in the morning and by the evening they had gone to school with her, tennis practices, piano, dance classes.”
 At 2017’s biggest spelling bee, Ashrita is shown in the documentary finishing in 35th place after misspelling the word elidible — meaning capable of being elided, or to leave out of consideration. Since filming of the documentary ended, she earned a spot on the stage for top spellers again in 2018 and 2019, finishing 42nd then 51st.
 Now 13 years old, Ashrita remains a top competitor at her new home in Virginia, where she recently finished seventh grade.
 With the 2020 bee — originally scheduled for early June — now cancelled due to COVID-19 concerns, next year will be Ashrita’s last chance to compete before she becomes too old to participate.

The world’s top-ranked player, Rory McIlroy, began the day with a chance to catch the leaders, but bogeyed the first hole, the course’s easiest. Things went downhill from there. Playing at Colonial for the first time, he bogeyed the fourth, fifth and ninth holes and double-bogeyed the seventh, taking himself out of contention early. He finished with a 4-over-par 74.
 Playing with McIlroy was DeChambeau, who was as buoyant as his partner was dispirited. DeChambeau had played the event four times and made the cut only once. He teed off Sunday three strokes behind Schauffele, the third-round leader, but with five birdies in a nine-hole stretch near the middle of his round, he charged into a tie for the lead.
 DeChambeau’s 145-yard approach shot to the 17th green flew long and into a difficult spot to chip from behind the hole. He did not recover well from that predicament, and the ensuing bogey dampened his momentum. Still, he had a chance to get into the playoff with a birdie attempt on 18 that he nearly holed.

The common story goes that in 1939 the British were looking for brilliant minds who could help them decrypt the secret messages that the Germans were sending each other, called the German Enigma cipher. It was a deep mystery that had baffled the top minds of the field, and so for this purpose was built the top secret elite codebreaking facility known as Bletchley Park, a place so classified that barely anyone even knew it existed at all and which employed such geniuses as Alan Turing, who would invent the modern computer. As the Defense Ministry scrambled to recruit codebreakers for the war effort, a difficult thing to do since at the time the British were behind the curve when it came to military intelligence, and in fact had no dedicated specialized intelligence schools from which to draw from, and so they were forced to go through files and hope they could find what they needed. It was in this way that they supposedly came across Tandy’s file, which described him as being one of the best “cryptogrammists”, or codebreakers, in the country, and he just so happened to be enlisted with the Royal Navy Reserves. How fortunate! The problem was, whoever read that file didn’t realize that Tandy was not a codebreaking “cryptogrammist,” but rather a “cryptogammist,” a specialist of algae and seaweed.

"The hanging bulb acts as a diaphragm that vibrates when sound waves hit the bulb," explains the research team in an accompanying video. "In addition, when the bulb is turned on it acts as a transducer, converting air pressure from sound to small changes of light."
 Before you start blacking out windows, there are some limitations to bear in mind. The spoken and sung audio was played through speakers at a higher volume than normal for human conversation, and for now the technique only works on hanging light bulbs (not those fixed into the ceiling or inside a lamp).
 The researchers themselves suggest some ways of guarding against an eavesdropping attack of this kind – by using lower energy bulbs, for example, or heavier bulbs, both of which would reduce the strength of the vibrations. They emphasize that their intention is to raise awareness of these types of attacks, rather than to enable anyone to carry them out.
 "As a future research direction, we suggest analyzing whether sound can be recovered via other light sources," write the researchers in their paper. "One interesting example is to examine whether it is possible to recover sound from decorative LED flowers instead of a light bulb."
 This is only the first attack attempt of its kind, so it's likely that the Lamphone and devices like it are going to get better over time, giving you another reason to keep your curtains drawn. There's an interesting game of cat and mouse going on in the field of surveillance, as researchers develop both more ways to eavesdrop and more ways to stop it.
