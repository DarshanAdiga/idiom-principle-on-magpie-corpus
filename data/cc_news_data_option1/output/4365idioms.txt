DARTMOUTH -- Cancellation of all its major fundraiser events due to the coronavirus, forced the Humane Society & Shelter SouthCoast to go out and apply for a disaster assistance loan from the Small Business Administration.
 The low-interest loans were made available by the SBA for businesses and non- profits that suffered substantial economic injury due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 "All of our fundraising events had to be cancelled," said Melina Ventura, executive director of the shelter. The upcoming "Give Me Shelter" Gala Fundraising Event that would have happened next month has been canceled, due to the pandemic. That fundraiser alone typically brings in some $45,000 in donations, Ventura said.
 "There's no way we could have held the event and keep with social distancing," she said. "Businesses are so generous, but how do you ask a business like a restaurant to donate?" she asked, knowing they are struggling financially during the coronavirus crisis.
 However, Ventura was staring down at a leaky roof and dog kennels that needed to be redone and had to make the choice and apply for a loan to cover the renovation expense.
 "This building is over 20 years old. The roof couldn't wait," she said.
 The shelter's 48 indoor/outdoor kennel dog runs are also being refurbished starting in November. Ventura explained that constant cleaning of the runs with disinfecting chemicals takes its toll on the flooring over the years.
 The roof replacement, Ventura said, is complete except for the cupola that was removed for repairs. The kennel runs should take a couple of weeks.
 The total cost of the project, she said, is around $149,000.
 The shelter is a holding facility for animals coming from Dartmouth and Marion. It takes overflows of animals from New Bedford, Fairhaven, and Fall River. It also serves as a state-approved quarantine facility taking animals mostly from southern states where animal overpopulation is high, Ventura said.
 Another popular summer program that had to be put on hiatus because of the pandemic, Ventura said, was the Shelter Buddie Kids Club.
 "We couldn't put the kids in jeopardy," Ventura said, noting it would have been difficult to run the program with social distancing rules. The four- session summer program teaches children ages 6 to 11 about all forms of animal care. "Hopefully by next summer the program will be back," she said.
 The shelter is open to the public for adoptions, Ventura said. It's also still delivering donated pet food to senior citizens who cannot get out to purchase food for their pet.
 Ventura said the shelter plans to go ahead with its Christmas fundraiser, which is a direct mailing way to secure donations.
 The next in-person fundraiser happens in the spring during its Easter Basket giveaway event. However, Ventura said she doesn't know what coronavirus restrictions might still be in place then, leaving plans for that fundraiser up in the air.
 Anyone can donate to the shelter at its website, by mailing a check, or calling the main office at 508-995-6661 with a credit card donation.

Two weeks ago, MCA-Morocco launched a set of projects on various sectors including employability.
 During a session of MCA-Morocco’s Strategic Orientation Board on October 14, with Morocco's Minister of Economy and Finance Mohamed Benchaaboun, the organization pledged to integrate the program’s beneficiaries in the professional world through several partnerships with INDH, the Ministry of Labor, and the National Agency for Job and Skill Promotion (ANAPEC), among others.
 By signing the agreement with INDH, MCA-Morocco is advancing another step of the cooperation program "Compact II" that Morocco and the US signed in 2015.
 The 2017-2022 Moroccan-American program runs with a budget of $450 million. It has a focus on analyzing difficulties facing investors in Morocco in order to promote sustainable growth and enhance human capital.
 As part of its objective, MCA-Morocco aims to promote employment within populations in difficulty.
 MCA-Morocco announced on August 10 the launch of “Lab Emploi,” or “Employment Lab,” an initiative to support the evaluation of employment and labor market policies in Morocco.
 The initiative aims to establish capacities in Morocco to assess, develop, and implement policies for the labor market, on the basis of scientific data.

Slattery also said Champagne “pays attention to what people want” and is “very perceptive.”
 Thomas, who is also appearing on the ballot for the Working Families Party and Independent Party, said fiscal responsibility is one of her priorities. She said she has worked with other Coventry officials to keep taxes low during her time on the Town Council.
 Thomas also said preservation of agriculture and open space has been a priority, adding that she has helped Coventry leverage partnerships with land trusts and other organizations to maintain such properties in town.
 Public safety is another key issue for Thomas, she said. She noted Coventry had one of the first police departments to implement body cameras, which were 100 percent grant-funded, and achieved more rigorous policing standards before they were required by state law.
 Thomas said that, following the departure of a Republican chairman, she was elected chairwoman of the Town Council during the 2015-17 term despite it being controlled by Republicans at the time.
 “I don’t draw lines in the sand,” she said.
 If elected, Thomas said she would focus on “rebuilding the economy in our district through, and after COVID,” which would include support for manufacturers and small agricultural businesses like distilleries, wineries, and farm stands.
 Thomas also said she would support manufacturing programs within community colleges and work on developing “a robust apprenticeship program for people who want to go into the trades.”
 Thomas said she would work to make healthcare more affordable, which would include supporting a public option that would allow individuals to opt into the state employee healthcare plan.
 Both Champagne and Thomas said securing funding for those with crumbling foundations in the district is a major priority.
 Zozan Antar, a Vernon resident, said Thomas is a “passionate” local leader. She said she supports Thomas because she cares about environmental and agricultural issues, and because of her experience in education.
 Antar also said Thomas is a supporter of womens’ rights and would work to economically benefit single mothers in the area.

Unstoppable force seems to have met an immovable object at a Singapore tribunal last weekend. You bet. It’s rather rare that Reliance Industries’ deals get derailed. But, then, Amazon is no pushover either. And, when the stakes are high, you can expect a tooth-and-nail fight. This clash of the titans, Jeff Bezos and Mukesh Ambani, among the two richest persons of the world, has big implications.
 Such as...
 One, Future’s future is at stake. If its ₹24,713-crore deal announced in August to sell the chunk of its business to Reliance Retail does not go through, because of the legal challenge mounted by Amazon, the debt-laden Future Group may be staring at liquidation. Amazon’s alternative fund-raising options for Future may not be workable now — it’s just too much water under the bridge.
 Next, Reliance Retail’s growth plans face a potential setback. Reliance Retail — already the country’s largest organised retailer with about 12,000 stores — was expecting a quick scale-up with the acquisition of the Future Group’s 1,800 or so stores. The acquisition would also have helped Reliance Industries’ plans to take on the entrenched Amazon and Flipkart in the e-commerce sweepstakes in India.
 Besides, the many marquee investors who have put in thousands of crores for a stake in Reliance Retail the past few months might be uneasy over the recent turn of events. Their investments would have assumed that Future’s major businesses are in Reliance Retail’s kitty. So, it’s a big deal for Reliance.
 Now, why is Amazon playing the spoilsport, or is it?
 Well, think about the fracas from Amazon’s perspective. It had bought 49 per cent in Future Coupons in August last year for ₹1,430 crore; FDI rules did not allow it to invest in Future Retail. Future Coupons held 7.3 per cent in Future Retail and so Amazon indirectly held about 3.6 per cent in Future Retail.
 The agreement also gave Amazon an option of acquiring all or part of the promoter’s shareholding in Future Retail between the third and tenth year. There were also some share-transfer restrictions on the promoter shares in the company and a right of first offer to Amazon. Besides, Amazon had drawn up a ‘negative list’ of entities to whom shares could not be sold; Reliance Industries was part of this list.
 Amazon’s investment in Future Coupons would have been predicated on improving its presence in the brick-and-mortal retail space in India. Amazon is said to have been informally helping Future Retail find a suitable investor such as Premji Invest — before Kishore Biyani decided to hitch his wagon to Mukesh Ambani. Net-net, Amazon feels short-changed by the Future-Reliance deal, which it thinks will make its investment futile. So, it petitioned a Singapore arbitral tribunal, asking to stop the deal.
 It’s got relief, it seems
 Well, Amazon has won the first round. The emergency arbitrator has put an interim stay on the Future-Reliance deal. But the legal battle is far from over. Future Retail says it is not a party to the agreement under which Amazon has invoked arbitration proceedings. It has questioned the Singapore court’s jurisdiction, and said that the order will have to be tested under the Indian Arbitration Act.
 Both Future Retail and Reliance Retail have said that they propose to complete the transaction without delay. Amazon, meanwhile, could also be moving to have the stay enforced.
 So, a grand legal battle beckons
 Yes. Unless the warring parties smoke the peace pipe. The Future rides on hope.

On the other hand, it’s the relish exercised in the implementation of rules by minor officials, shop people and half the damned world I meet daily which seriously irks. The more rules of behaviour there are, the more the self- righteous and jobsworths exult in their enforcement. I was at the check-out of a DIY warehouse this morning – it’s unusual, but it does happen. There were lines on the floor, indicating where social distancing required that one should stand. An old fellow in front of me toting a sheet of plywood twice his size stepped over his line by maybe a foot. The cash-desk woman went bonkers… if you don’t mind, monsieur, step back; can you not read signs? What do you think the lines are for? Maybe she was having a bad day. Maybe she was an unpleasant person. The old fellow grew flustered – he’d probably not been told off by anyone except his wife for 50 years – and lost his grip on the plywood. I caught it, and suggested he took a trolley next time. There was tutting all over the place – both in favour of and against the cash-desk lady.

Stagnation of sewage water in the basement floor of a commercial complex on Madurai road has posed serious health hazards to customers and local residents.
 Customers visiting SBI, UCO Bank and the regional office of the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation and other private commercial establishments at Shree complex undergo untold sufferings due to stagnation of the sewage water.
 Knee-deep sewage, discharged by commercial establishments and those staying in the building, has been stagnating for more than two weeks, emitting a pungent stench and turning the area into a breeding ground for vectors. With sewage water occupying the entire basement floor, it looks like a pool.
 Apparently, sewage generated from the building could not be discharged into the storm water drain on Madurai road ever since the construction of the drain began a few weeks ago. A few other complexes also face the issue. Since the outlet points have been blocked, the onus on clearing sewage has been passed on to owners of the complexes and buildings. Some of them engage private players to clear sewage water. However, the evidently half-hearted efforts have failed. There is also a view that the Corporation, which is supposed to ensure smooth flow of sewage and domestic waste, has passed the buck on users.
 The tussle has ultimately caused hardship to hundreds of customers, pensioners and others, who visit the commercial complexes. It poses serious threat to public health to provident fund members, and elderly persons, who visit the EPFO office to get their grievance redressed. They fear that it will spread diseases especially when people are already going through trying times due to the spread of COVID-19.
 “The customers face untold sufferings due to the problem. It is time the issue issue gets solved before the onset of monsoon,” says Shashikant Dahiya, Assistant Provident Fund Commissioner, Tiruchi.
 The tenants and the establishments that function in the complex took up the issue with the Corporation and owner of the building.
 Corporation Commissioner S. Sivasubramanian told The Hindu that he had personally visited the spot to take stock of the situation. The sewage stagnation posed the danger of spreading diseases. Hence, the owner and tenants of the complex had been served notices to solve the issue within seven days. Else, action would be taken against the responsible persons under the Tamil Nadu Public Health Act.

 # Pender Memorial picks up backlog of eye surgery cases
 Jim Ware
 StarNews Correspondent
 When glaucoma patient Shirley Smith of Winnabow was told by her ophthalmologist that she needed eye surgery and it would be done at Pender Memorial Hospital, she was admittedly skeptical at first.
 “I think it’s about a 40-mile one-way trip” from her Brunswick County home to the hospital in Burgaw, Smith said.
 Ruth A. Glaser, president of Pender Memorial Hospital, said she understands Smith’s initial skepticism.
 “You’re going to a physician in Wilmington and they say to you you’re going to go have surgery in Pender,” Glaser said. “Many of these people don’t even know that we have a hospital.”
 Pender Memorial’s two surgical services suites had been handling about 30 surgeries a month, mostly cataract cases, before the advent of COVID-19, she said. Now Pender sees about 400 eye surgery cases a month, a 1,233 percent increase.
 The pandemic forced New Hanover Regional Medical Center in Wilmington, which manages Pender Memorial, to cancel elective surgeries including outpatient cataract and glaucoma cases. When the hospital resumed elective surgeries, there was a backlog of cases, Glaser said.
 “Once we were back up and running as a system, they looked across the system and said, ‘OK, how can we do this and get as many people the surgery they needed before COVID as quickly as they possibly could?’” Glaser said. “They looked to us to say, ‘Hey, you guys have done eye cases before. Maybe we can move the service line to you. It helps you get busier. It helps the system. It helps the patients.’”
 While cataract cases needed to get done, patients like Smith who needed glaucoma surgeries were the more urgent issue, she said.
 “May was the first month we did some of those new cases, new volume, new surgeons here at Pender,” Glaser said.
 Since Pender Memorial had been staffed to handle about 30 surgeries a month, the NHRMC system helped the small community hospital ramp up, she said.
 “We got equipment from the system,” Glaser said. “We staffed up with some support from New Hanover – some of their team helping to support us to be able to deliver that.”
 Before May, the hospital had two ophthalmologists credentialed to do surgeries. Now it has 13, along with additional anesthesiologists and certified registered nurse anesthetists, she said.
 Pender’s surgical services suites were renovated a decade ago, but hadn’t seen a great deal of use since, Glaser said. That meant the hospital had the physical capacity to handle the flood of backlog cases from NHRMC, she said.
 While New Hanover Regional continues to handle high-risk and pediatric eye surgeries, Pender Memorial is handling the rest, Glaser said.
 The result is Pender Memorial is seeing patients arrive from as far away as Myrtle Beach, though most come from New Hanover, Brunswick, and Pender counties, she said.
 And that means the hospital is busier than ever, Glaser said.
 “It used to be when you drove in our campus there was parking – plenty of parking,” she said. “It’s not that we are pressed for parking, but it’s something I notice when I come in in the morning – how full the parking lot is. That’s a good thing, obviously.”
 Glaser said the surgeons deserve much of the credit for the increase because they’re telling their patients about how great the staff and facilities are at Pender Memorial, despite the drive.
 “What we knew, and we’ve experienced is patients and patients’ families are just blown away by the service that they get,” she said.
 Smith, a patient of Dr. Mary Elizabeth Price of Carolina Glaucoma in Wilmington, couldn’t agree more.
 “It was a very, very good experience from going into the front door until I came back out after having surgery,” she said. “They could not have been nicer. Very clean facility. Everybody very caring.”
 Smith said the manager of the surgical services department even stopped by to see if there was anything she needed.
 “I would go back to Pender Memorial if I had to have eye surgery or whatever if they were doing other surgeries,” she said.
 Glaser said her hope as a hospital administrator is that the boom in patients continues long term, but then there’s the reality of a physician group’s eye surgery center opening next fall in Wilmington
 “We know when that opens come next August, we’ll lose probably half of the volume to them,” she said. “We’ve got to figure out how to best use our ORs.”
 In the meantime, the transition to a busy eye surgery center has been a perfect fit for Pender Memorial, Glaser said.
 “It’s a small hospital and so we’re all excited that they’re here,” she said. “So, we stop and speak to people. It’s just a small community hospital. It’s a little bit different feel than a major medical center or even a really busy ambulatory surgery center. These folks are pretty important when they cross the threshold.”

Second, while I regret the mistake, I don’t regret taking a risk and learning from a failure.

No Man's Sky's next update isn't really for us. The Next Generation update was announced today, and its headline features only come into play if you end up buying either Microsoft or Sony's new tellyboxes next month. But bringing the space romp up to scratch for the new consoles comes with some nice visual benefits for those of us exploring the galaxy on PC.
 Cut through the console-specific new features (which, let's be fair, largely bring those versions up to par with the PC build), and you'll find some lovely new visual upgrades for players on 'Ultra' graphics settings. The density of detail models like grass, rocks, fungi and weird space hexagons has been ramped right up, while there's been a general bumping-up of draw distances for all objects.
 Model and texture definition has also been "significantly increased", and grass should now push aside nicely when walking through fields. It does all look quite nice, too, with comparison shots showing worlds that suffer less from that dramatic detail fallout I've come to associate with No Man's Sky's worlds.
 There's a few other fixes and improvements to go along with the visual upgrade. Target locking in orbital dogfights has been tightened up, a number of icons have been updated, and a particularly nasty crash involved in loading older, larger saves has been fixed. The full list is available to scroll through in the 3.10 Patch Notes at the bottom of the update page.
 No Man's Sky's Next Generation update will be free to download when the new consoles launch, which probably means it'll drop alongside the Xbox Series X on November 10. Until then, there's still time to dive into some eerie space derelicts to unlock goofy monster hats in No Man's Sky's Halloween update.

He will be hosting a current affairs series, something that plays into his strengths. It will be a one-hour, single-topic show in which Stewart will be discussing the day’s big story — similar to what he did on his Comedy Central show.
 But he’s good at it.
 There’s a local angle to Stewart’s return. Richard Plepler, a former Manchester resident who stepped down as CEO of HBO 10 months ago, will be an executive producer on the new series through his new company, new Eden Productions.
 During his 27 years at HBO, many of the network’s hits were under his watch, including “Game of Thrones.”
 Now he has a new role as producer. If you’re going to start a new aspect of your career, getting involved with a talent such as Stewart is a good way to do it.
 ‘Dallas’ distinction
 Here’s how popular “Dallas” was during its peak on CBS — people wouldn’t go out on Friday nights until “Dallas” was over. CBS wouldn’t schedule any NBA playoff games until “Dallas” was over.
 “Dallas” might not have been the first prime-time soap opera on network television, but it was certainly the most popular. The show’s famous “Who Shot JR?” episode was one of the most-watched TV shows of all-time.
 “Dallas” is being credited for something else, however — something that stretches the realm of credibility.
 According to musician David Stewart of the Eurythmics, “Dallas” might have played a role in the collapse of the Soviet Union.
 And Stewart received that information from a good source — former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
 In a recent podcast, Stewart said that “Dallas,” because it was about wealth, success and power, made Soviet Union residents think about wanting to live in America.
 “They thought that’s how people lived in the United States,” Stewart said. “Obviously they don’t.”
 On television, however, they did.
 If “Dallas” was really responsible for the fall of the Soviet Union, the show’s star, Larry Hagman, would have asked for more money.
 Besides, there was another reason for the collapse — the USA Olympic hockey team’s miracle on ice win over the Soviet Union in 1980. The Soviets couldn’t live that down.

SPACs do have working capital contributed by the sponsors, but it is usually a relatively modest amount of capital compared to the cost of defending and settling any serious director and officer-type litigation. This relative lack of capital highlights the importance of the the D&O insurance program that is purchased for the SPAC’s directors and officers.

Make sure that the lawyers who are drafting the S-1 registration statement are experienced in SPACs and securities laws. Remember, the SEC is particularly concerned about SPAC disclosures. Can the lawyers draft clear language around what the sponsor incentives are? This is not a place to cut corners. You will want to ensure disclosures are clear so that it is harder for a future disgruntled shareholder to say there were incentives that the board purposely hid from shareholders. You will also want to understand which law firm the SPAC plans to use for the de-SPAC (aka merger) transaction. Many SPAC formation specialists do not have abundant experience with M&A activity. It is good as a board member to understand what the plan will be given how important it is for the board to get good advice throughout the entirety of a SPAC’s lifecycle.

“You don’t win an election on the day of the vote. You win the day you start to make it impossible for the opposition to compete on equal footing,” says Fatma Karume, the former head of the Tanganyika Law Society, the bar association for mainland Tanzania. She herself has tasted the government’s wrath: she was permanently disbarred for bringing an “unprofessional and disrespectful” case against the country’s attorney general.
 At the same time, support for the opposition cannot be measured only by its percentage of the final vote tally, she says. Throughout the election season, Tanzanians have shown outspoken support for Dr. Magufuli’s main challenger, Tundu Lissu, of the Chama cha Demokrasia na Maendeleo (Chadema) party, who was the target of an assassination attempt by unknown attackers in 2017 and campaigned this year with a bullet still lodged near his spine.
 Mr. Lissu drew huge crowds to his campaign rallies despite government attempts to suppress them by tear-gassing supporters, briefly suspending his campaign in early October for using “seditious language,” and arresting seven members of the opposition youth wing for “ridiculing the national anthem and flag” when they sang Tanzania’s national anthem while lifting their party flag.
 It is nearly impossible to gauge the level of support for Chadema and Mr. Lissu, given the lack of credible and independent polling in Tanzania. However, the party won 42% of the vote in the last election, whose fairness was also disputed, and many point to the government’s suppression of opposition rallies and refusal to let many opposition parliamentary and local council candidates stand in today's elections as evidence that it is concerned about their rising power.
 “In this campaign, Tanzanians have been saying that they deserve certain rights, and that they won’t be bullied out of them so easily,” says Ms. Eyakuze, the political analyst. “So if they want to attend a rally, they’re not willing to give up their right to do that just because the government is making it difficult.”

Mit einem »Masterplan BER 2040« sollten in den kommenden 20 Jahren schrittweise Kapazitaten fur 55 Millionen Passagiere jahrlich geschaffen werden. Die Corona-Pandemie ließ diese Plane regelrecht absturzen. Von Januar bis September dieses Jahres zahlten die Berliner Airports nur noch knapp uber acht Millionen Passagiere - 70 Prozent weniger als im Vorjahr. Im deutschen wie im weltweiten Schnitt gingen die Passagierzahlen um 60 bis 66 Prozent zuruck.

ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Greek authorities on Wednesday arrested the captain of a Portuguese-flagged cargo ship that collided with a Greek navy minehunter outside the country’s main port of Piraeus. The coast guard said the captain of the Maersk Launceston container vessel was arrested for alleged violations of the Greek penal code and of the International Regulations for the Prevention of Collisions at Sea. The Kallisto, a British-built vessel capable of sweeping and hunting mines, was cut in two in Tuesday’s collision, with much of its stern severed. Two of the 27 crew members on board were taken to a hospital with slight injuries. The rest were evacuated from the ship, which was towed to a nearby navy base. No damage was reported to the Maersk Launceston, which is managed by the Germany-based company John T. Essberger, and no injuries were reported among the ship's 22 crew members. In a statement Wednesday, the company said Greek authorities interviewed the cargo ship’s crew and have officially charged the ship’s captain. Greek authorities requested for the ship to remain in port, and a company representative was providing support to the ship’s master and crew. “The exact details of the incident which took place early on Tuesday, October 27 are yet unclear. Greek authorities are continuing their investigations, to which John T. Essberger will offer its full cooperation,” the company said in its statement. “Managers again would like to express their concern over the injuries of the crew of Kallisto, wishing them a speedy recovery.” The container vessel had been heading from Piraeus to the Turkish port of Canakkale when the collision occurred.

He was hired to take Kilborn’s place and he took “The Daily Show” to the next level, both ratings wise and performance wise. He succeeded on two levels — as a comedian who examined the day’s events. And as an interviewer.
 Here’s how good Stewart was at his job. “The Daily Show” won 10 consecutive Emmy awards for best late-night talk show and 20 overall in 56 nominations.
 Stewart went from being a failure to being one of the hottest hosts in late- night TV. Not only was his career booming, he also jump-started the careers of fellow talk show hosts such as Stephen Colbert, Samantha Bee and John Oliver.
 Thanks to his work on the “Daily Show,” Stewart hosted the Academy Awards on two occasions.
 Here’s the most important part of Stewart’s career — his influence. Young viewers were getting their news from him. Not “NBC Nightly News” or “ABC World News Tonight.” And not the cable news networks such as MSNBC, CNN and Fox News Channel.
 Viewers in the male 18-to-34 age group said they were getting their news from Stewart.
 Not only was he competing against the likes of David Letterman and Jay Leno, he was competing against the network news anchors such as Brian Williams and Charles Gibson.
 Stewart’s career was on a roll — until he decided to stop it.
 He left “The Daily Show” in 2015, giving the keys to the studio to Trevor Noah.
 For the next five years, Stewart stayed away from the spotlight, appearing only occasionally to fight for the rights of First Responders who suffered in the 9/11 terrorist attacks
 No one ever retires from late-night TV, however — they just wait for one more good deal to come along.
 Stewart has found one. According to the Hollywood Reporter. Stewart has agreed to a deal with Apple TV+ where he will produce new series for the streaming channel.
 The first show in his deal has a big star — Stewart.

After the Civil War, slaves were freed into a sharecropping system that resulted in generational poverty. Black families were blocked from educational and political opportunities. Industrialization led to fewer jobs in the fields. And after the Civil Rights movement made strides for racial equity and integration, white families began leaving, taking tax dollars with them.
 From 2000 to 2010, white population decreased from 20% to 10% of Itta Bena. Total population has decreased by one-third -- from around 3,000 to 1,800 -- since 1980.
 Birdia and John Williams bought their home 23 years ago from a white family moving away. She remembers driving through and seeing a beautiful neighborhood of nice, clean houses.
 "While we moved in, they were all moving out," said Williams, 64, a Black woman. "It's not the same city today as it used to be. We have good people here, lovely people. But there's nothing here anymore."
 Emma Harris, 66, was raised 10 miles away, where her parents worked on a white-owned plantation. She said her husband was born and worked on the plantation, until they married and moved to the Itta Bena area in 1978. Growing up, she remembers traveling the country road to shop in Itta Bena and seeing the "city lights" downtown.
 Today, 20 downtown storefronts are abandoned. Remaining are a laundromat, a used-car seller, a clinic run by a nurse practitioner, a bar, a credit union. The corner store sells canned food, bread, fishing gear - with a small food menu from a kitchen in back.
 The nearest grocery store is 10 miles away; a Dollar General sells some fruits and vegetables. Some folks, like Williams, travel 45 miles to a bargain store in Grenada for groceries.
 Businesses and city offices will lose power if MEAM leaves. Some businesses purchased generators as backup. Only institutions like the historically Black Mississippi Valley State University, whose utility system is separate from the city's, will be unaffected.
 Itta Bena's financial woes aren't new. In 2014, the federal government placed a tax lien on city assets after officials failed to pay $200,000 in payroll taxes. In 2016, a former city clerk was convicted of embezzlement. The power debt dates back to 2009.
 MEAM didn't answer a request for comment, but in a letter shared with the Public Service Commission, President and CEO Geoffrey Wilson said the company has exercised "extraordinary patience" trying to collect.
 "The situation brought about by the City's failure to pay its MEAM invoices in full is regrettable, but it is a situation of Itta Bena's own making," Wilson wrote.
 Residents said they were surprised to learn the city was so in debt. Itta Bena light bills are notoriously high.
 Williams said monthly bills for her one-story home sometimes exceed $650. Kathy Gee, who's lived in Itta Bena for 40 years and is on disability for lupus, said her income is about $500 monthly, and she's received bills over $400. The mayor said he's aware of high bills, and that rates are calculated correctly.
 Harris said she's tried approaching City Hall with partial payments, in hopes her power wouldn't be shut off.
 "My lights have been out many, many, many times because I didn't have the money," she said. "Knowing they are the ones in debt, you feel used. You work so hard for so long, and it feels like you get nothing in return."

 Knee-deep sewage, discharged by commercial establishments and those staying in the building, has been stagnating for more than two weeks, emitting a pungent stench and turning the area into a breeding ground for vectors. With sewage water occupying the entire basement floor, it looks like a pool.
 Apparently, sewage generated from the building could not be discharged into the storm water drain on Madurai road ever since the construction of the drain began a few weeks ago. A few other complexes also face the issue. Since the outlet points have been blocked, the onus on clearing sewage has been passed on to owners of the complexes and buildings. Some of them engage private players to clear sewage water. However, the evidently half-hearted efforts have failed. There is also a view that the Corporation, which is supposed to ensure smooth flow of sewage and domestic waste, has passed the buck on users.
 The tussle has ultimately caused hardship to hundreds of customers, pensioners and others, who visit the commercial complexes. It poses serious threat to public health to provident fund members, and elderly persons, who visit the EPFO office to get their grievance redressed. They fear that it will spread diseases especially when people are already going through trying times due to the spread of COVID-19.
 “The customers face untold sufferings due to the problem. It is time the issue issue gets solved before the onset of monsoon,” says Shashikant Dahiya, Assistant Provident Fund Commissioner, Tiruchi.
 The tenants and the establishments that function in the complex took up the issue with the Corporation and owner of the building.
 Corporation Commissioner S. Sivasubramanian told The Hindu that he had personally visited the spot to take stock of the situation. The sewage stagnation posed the danger of spreading diseases. Hence, the owner and tenants of the complex had been served notices to solve the issue within seven days. Else, action would be taken against the responsible persons under the Tamil Nadu Public Health Act.

After talking about all of the issues we finally said we have to post a schedule that represents that we are back to normal. We don't know when that is going to happen. So, we will be posting our 2021 schedule in the next couple weeks that is going to be very similar to our schedules in the past. People (drivers, fans, officials, sponsors) need to plan and know. I sincerely hope that in February or March we are not in the position that we are currently sitting in now.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice Department has charged eight people with participating in a covert effort on behalf of the Chinese government that aimed to locate Chinese dissidents and others in the U.S. who were wanted by Beijing and coercing them into returning to China.
 Five of the eight were arrested Wednesday, accused of participating in a covert Chinese operation that officials say was built on intimidation, bullying and “very disturbing” tactics. The other three are believed to be in China.
 The arrests are among a series of recent actions the Trump administration has taken against China, a country President Donald Trump regards as a prime adversary.
 In July, for instance, the Justice Department charged hackers working with the Chinese government with targeting firms developing vaccines for the coronavirus and stealing hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of intellectual property and trade secrets from companies across the world.
 “China is violating laws and norms left and right,” FBI Director Chris Wray said.

_Songbird_ is set in 2024, where COVID-23 has mutated (the mortality rate is over 50 percent and the virus kills at an accelerated rate) to the point that the world is in its fourth year (!!) of lockdown, and infected Americans are forced from their homes and into quarantine camps. It was phone call that planted the seeds of that story in Mason's mind too -- and it spread virus- fast from there. The day after parts of the country went into official lockdown on March 13, the filmmaker received a call from his writing partner Simon Boyes. "It was surprisingly early, and he was surprisingly excited," says Mason. "I was like, 'Why are you excited? It's the end of the world.' He said, 'We should just go and make a movie. We should just get together with our friends and do something on our phones.'" Mason and Boyes spent the rest of that first Saturday in lockdown frantically typing up a 12-page "call to arms" that outlined the plot for _Songbird_ and also included details on what they were going to do and how they were going to pull it off during a pandemic. Mason then sent an email to producer Adam Goodman with the pages attached and the subject line: "Crazy Idea!" Another day and another phone call later, Goodman was on board and so was, little-known producer, Michael Bay ( _Armageddon, Pearl Harbor, Transformers_ ).

My son showed me a Facebook video tonight by a woman named Jennifer Turner. In this video, she read excerpts from a book called ‘The Naked Communist,’ and it raised the hair on the back of my neck. For years, I’ve told friends and family about things that were coming, and tonight IO felt vindicated. IN 1963, information stating the goals of the Communist Party was read on the floor of the House of Representatives as a matter of record and a warning. Now I wonder how many in that Congress were already members of the movement. You see, one of their stated goals was to take over one or both of the political parties in America and subvert it for their own purposes. Looking at the current state of the Democratic Party, it’s easy to see which one was seduced into joining their globalist agenda.

"articleBody" : "
 Many parents take out student loans to help pay for their childs education. But not all of them share that information with their son or daughter. That silence is an easy misstep for parents who decide to borrow student loans in their own names. Other problems can include unaffordable payments, unclear expectations around repayment and not taking advantage of an opportunity to help the child build credit. To help prevent student debt from derailing their family, parents should assess their financial situation and talk openly with their children before borrowing student loans.
 In more than one-third of U.S. families, parents decide how to pay for college, according to a July 2020 report from private lender Sallie Mae.
 Half of those parents dont inform the child of their decision.
 Joe Allen, 51, of Frederick, Maryland, did talk about college costs with his daughter, a freshman at the University of Dayton in Ohio. But he understands why some families avoid the topic.
 As a parent, you want to protect your children, Allen says. You want to do whats best for them.
 But what seems best for children may be bad for mom or dad especially if it means taking out hefty parent student loans without discussing them. Heres how to avoid that misstep and others when borrowing parent loans.
 ASSESS YOUR SITUATION
 Students should exhaust free money and federal loans in their names to pay for college. Parents can then cover remaining costs with federal parent PLUS loans or private loans.
 But first, review your current financial situation with your child.
 Have a realistic sit-down with yourself and your family in terms of what (your) finances look like and whats the best decision for you, says Rick Castellano, spokesperson for Sallie Mae.
 Dont borrow parent student loans if theyll put your retirement at risk, youre deep in debt or you cant afford the payments. For example, the nonprofit Trellis Company surveyed more than 59,000 parents whose children attended school in Texas and found that most said they struggled with loan repayment at some point.
 HAVE A CONVERSATION
 Kathleen Burns Kingsbury, a wealth psychology expert and host of the Breaking Money Silence podcast, says talking about big expenses like college tuition can make people uncomfortable and emotional.
 That doesnt mean you should avoid the conversation.
 Its OK if people get upset, Kingsbury says. The pitfall is if people get upset and dont get back to it.
 Instead, use this opportunity to talk about how much youll borrow and to teach your child how to analyze the value of a large purchase.
 Allen says he went through a sample budget with his daughter to illustrate the cost of her loans and how they might limit her flexibility in the future.
 He liked that the exercise made things more concrete than just saying dont take out debt.
 FIGURE OUT WHOS RESPONSIBLE
 A conversation is also necessary to determine wholl repay the parents loans.
 If your child will and 45% of families expect the parent and child to at least share this responsibility, according to the Sallie Mae report that can affect your decisions.
 Angela Colatriano, chief marketing officer for College Ave Student Loans, says some families want the childs name on the loan because he or she will repay it.
 They dont want a handshake agreement, she says.
 But only the parent is legally responsible for a parent PLUS loan. Youll need to weigh that when considering borrowing options.
 PLUS loans have less stringent credit requirements than private loans and offer everyone the same fixed interest rate. However, PLUS loans also have large origination fees and are available only to parents guardians and grandparents arent eligible, for example.
 Your ultimate goal should be getting the least expensive loan you qualify for. If thats a PLUS loan, make sure everyone is on the same page for repayment.
 Kingsbury suggests writing a simple, one-page agreement that would spell out what the expectation is and what happens if theres a conflict.
 CONSIDER CO-SIGNING
 Parents who prefer private loans can borrow in their name or co-sign with their child. Either option means youll be responsible for the loan.
 It comes down to a family decision, Castellano says. Families should explore both options.
 But he says that co-signing can benefit students in ways that borrowing on your own cant, such as helping them build credit.
 Also, because a co-signed loan has two applicants, you may get a better interest rate. However, lender underwriting policies differ.
 For example, Allen initially got a much higher rate on a co-signed loan than he expected. The lender told him that was because it combined his credit score with his daughters.
 I didnt understand that, Allen says. I thought if Im co-signing and bringing good credit to the equation it should be a better rate.
 He applied with a different lender and got what he called a much better rate. Allen...",

John Magufuli, known as “the bulldozer,” will win today’s presidential elections in Tanzania. Of that there is very little doubt.
 But he will not win them fair and square. His economic policy over the past five years may have raised living standards, but his government has also jailed political critics, shut down newspapers, and prohibited opposition candidates from standing in the election.
 That approach, though, seems to be backfiring, and galvanizing the opposition Chadema party. Its leader, Tundu Lissu, has been drawing record crowds of supporters even though they risk being tear-gassed by the police, and opponents of the president, whose party has ruled Tanzania since independence in 1961, are growing bolder.
 “In this campaign, Tanzanians have been saying that they deserve certain rights and that they won’t be bullied out of them so easily,” says one local political analyst. “We are looking at how far we are able to take this democratic notion.”

I’m fed up, too, with masks. Not with the wearing of them. OK, they steam up your glasses but that’s not fatal.

Loudon County was well-represented last week when five teams with the Lenoir City High School Bass Club competed in the 2020 Mossy Oak Fishing Bassmaster High School National Championship on Kentucky Lake.
 “First and foremost, to qualify for the high school national championship is a feat in itself,” Allen Woods, LCHS Bass Club head coach, said. “These kids compete during the season to get that spot in nationals, and I jokingly said, ‘I’d like to see three teams.’ It all worked out and we sent five teams. I’m going to go out on a limb but I think out of all the high schools, we sent the most to the nationals this year. That was cool in itself and the kids helped accomplish that.”
 Four of five teams placed out of 200 boats. Zane O’Domirok and John Thompson finished 63rd overall with a bag of five fish for a total of 9.5 pounds.
 The team practiced Oct. 20-21 and followed up Thursday through Saturday in competition.
 “It was really cool because it’s not often that you get to see everyone who’s qualified, and this is the best of the best in the high school league,” Thompson said. “As far as the conditions go, Thursday it was really sunny and was the way we wanted it to be. That’s why the first day of the tournament went a lot better for us because we were catching fish that was related to shade, so it gave them a shade line to get into.”
 Other finishes included Colby Gatlin and Hunter Proctor, who placed 132nd with 4.5 pounds; Avery Johnson and Marshall Smith, who placed 157th with 2.12 pounds; and Dalton Bailey and Hayden Stockett, who placed 166th with 2.7 pounds.
 “Fishing Kentucky Lake this time of year, everything’s changing and they did what they could do,” Woods said. “Fish don’t play nice sometimes, and I’m glad to see some of our seniors getting to go. This year was a little bit different because usually the lake opens up on Sunday. They couldn’t be on the lake until Tuesday and Wednesday to practice so if you didn’t have a predetermined notion about the lake and what you wanted to do, you had to do a lot in those two practice days.”
 At least one team from LCHS has qualified each year for the national championship in the last four years. Woods believes more is on the horizon.
 “I think we’ve got 24 members right now and it just keeps growing,” he said. “I spoke with my wife (Monday) and the state director from Ohio, and these kids are blessed beyond measure being able to fish as much as they can fish. In Ohio, they’ve got a handful of tournaments. If we have a state or region, you might have as many as 250 boats. That’s what gives us those opportunities to get as many spots as we get, and it’s pretty cool to be a part of that.”
 The 2020-21 season started Sept. 19, and Lenoir City is primed to make another run at the state and national championships next summer.
 “For my senior year, I’d like to finish in the top 10 and at least finish in the trail point races,” Thompson said. “Hopefully, we can make it to nationals again. If we can make top 10 in the points race in one of the trails we fish in, we’ll be able to go to nationals again. It’d be good to make it two years in a row and one last time.”

 # Trump has earned the Christian vote
 Dennis Campbell
 Granite City Baptist Church
 America is at the crossroads of the most important election in the history of the United States. It is not a matter of two parties. It is truly a spiritual battle between wickedness and righteousness.
 There is a huge contrast between the Democratic platform and the Trump administration. The Democrats promote the defunding of police, murdering of babies, the increase of government regulations, a big government that would control the people, and open borders.
 They appoint humanistic judges, they support the bailing out of criminals, support riots, looting, the destruction of our cities and getting rid of God in our pledge.
 The Trump administration supports law and order, it is the most pro-life administration in history, it built a strong economy by using deregulation and tax cuts. They have worked hard on getting rid of the swamp and big government, the economic program brought low unemployment. They are working on closing the borders to illegal immigrants.
 How could anyone with any common sense vote for those who support the Democratic platform? Anyone that believes in our heritage, our Constitution and the Bible will vote for Trump. Even a priest said no true Catholic should vote Democrat.
 It is time for America to turn to Christ and the Bible for advice.

NEWLAND — In a renewed effort to tamp down on the drug activity present in Newland, the Newland Police Department has been awarded a K9 training grant from the Governor’s Crime Commission.
 The grant is funded 100 percent by the North Carolina Department of Public Safety and does not require a local match. The town will purchase the K9s, the equipment, as well as cover the costs for training, and in turn receives a reimbursement from the state.
 “We’re still in the very early stages,” Newland Police Chief Byron Clawson said. “There are people that breed the K9s and it is their speciality. They’re looking for certain traits and bloodline. They provide the training and they help train our officers, because our officer has to be gone for about six weeks to their training facility.”
 Clawson said that the department is looking at expediting the process in hopes of having the dogs in service by next spring. However, Clawson said he understands that the process will take time before it is under way. The K9s may even be utilized by other departments in the county.
 “Of course, we have mutual aid with other municipalities, and once we get the program up and running, if needed, all they got to do is call and our K9 will be en route to help,” Clawson said.
 The need for the K9s comes as the department has seen an increase in drug use and drug-related crimes in town. The increase in drug-related arrests, as well as the increased call volume and demand on the NPD has been a point of focus at town council meetings over the last several months.
 “It’s weekly. I wouldn’t say daily, but we’re encountering citizens here that (appear) messed up on drugs. Of course, our drug arrests have went up some, but basically (the K9 program) will help stop and slow down the amount of illegal drugs within the city limits of Newland,” Clawson said.
 According to Neighborhood Scout, Newland has a crime index of 54, meaning it is safer than 54 percent of US cities. The town boasts a violent crime rate of 1.46 out of 1,000 residents and a property crime rate of 10.20 out of 1,000 residents. Additionally, Newland residents have a significantly lower chance of being the victims of violent crime compared to the state average. The chances of becoming a victim are one in 686 in Newland compared to one in 265 across the state.
 While Newland is a safe area to live, the uptick in drug activity is a cause for concern. Nationally, drug use has been on the rise during the pandemic. According to a study conducted by The Recovery Village, 36 percent of respondents reported an increase in illicit drug use, with the need to cope with stress, relieve boredom and cope with mental health problems listed as reasons for the increase in use during the pandemic. Clawson says that he has seen this trend locally as well.
 “Absolutely. Since this started, we’ve had an uptick in several locations here in town that we’re aware of. We’ve made some arrests and have tried to keep it down as good as we can. The horrible thing about it is that it’s decent people ruining their lives. It just breaks my heart. It really does,” Clawson said.

They most recently didn't even sniff covering a 10.5-point spread in a 30-28 win over the glaringly shorthanded Philadelphia Eagles.

It may hurt and feel like the government won this time, but know one thing, with good strategies, we would have the last laugh.

 # LA Dodgers with Nashville ties create buzz with World Series triumph
 Drake Hills
 Nashville Tennessean
 View Comments
 Nashville was well represented in the 2020 World Series, as the Los Angeles Dodgers won Game 6 on Tuesday to win it all and take home the Commissioner's Trophy.
 Overton High's Mookie Betts, Belmont Bruins' Matt Beaty and Vanderbilt's Walker Buehler and David Price represented Nashville on baseball's biggest stage. Price opted out of the 2020 due to COVID-19 concerns, but said he is enjoying the victory in his own way.
 Price was the No. 1 overall selection in the 2007 MLB Draft, after being named National Player of the Year, Dick Howser Award trophy winner, First-Team All- American and SEC champion, among others.
 The Dodgers has brought a championship back to L.A. for the first time since 1988. Betts, wasn't even born yet. But the four-time Golden Glove winner and 2018 MVP arrived in Los Angeles this offseason to win. He did just that, announcing late Tuesday that his mission is complete.
 "The job is finished!!!!!" Betts said via his Twitter late Tuesday night.
 Vanderbilt and Belmont Baseball soon followed with similar sentiments.
 Buehler pitched in Game 3 of the World Series against the Tampa Bay Rays at Globe Life Park in Dallas. Buehler racked up 10 strikeouts in six innings pitched, allowing three hits and one earned run. The right-hander was a part of the 2014 Commodores College World Series championship team and was the 24th overall selection in the MLB Draft the following year.
 Buehler finished the 2020 postseason with 39 strikeouts, allowing 18 hits and five earned runs in 25 innings.
 Dresden, Tenn., native and former Belmont star Matt Beaty is the first Bruin to win a World Series and the second to appear in one, behind Dwight Bernard with the 1982 Milwaukee Brewers. A first baseman, Beaty played in Game 3 and Game 4 as a pinch-hitter, with three total plate appearances .
 The Dodgers took Beaty in the 12th round of the 2015 draft, after earning All- OVC First Team honors that season. In 2018, Beaty made his Triple-A debut against the Nashville Sounds on May 25, while playing with the Oklahoma City Dodgers.

Benitez largely used Anita as a right-back as opposed to his favoured midfield position. The Dutchman was dubbed Newcastle's 'Mr Versatile' and while failing to nail down one position can have a debilitating effect on a career, Anita believes it has made him 'the player I am today.'
 In fact, Benitez saw his versatility as a vital asset and was keen to extend Anita's stay on Tyneside at the end of his contract in 2017.
 Anita, too, was keen for a second crack at the Premier League. Newcastle, though, had other ideas.
 "I had some conversations with the manager," he explained.
 "We told each other that we both would like to extend my contract with Newcastle. Unfortunately, the club let me know that their choice was to give me no new contract.
 "I regret that decision but on the other hand, that’s football. Life goes on and I have no hard feelings against Newcastle United. I still follow the club and their matches."
 Anita was released as a free agent in 2017 and joined Leeds United in the Championship. An ankle injury disrupted his first season in West Yorkshire and once he recovered he found himself way down the pecking order.
 A season on loan with Dutch side Willem II followed in 2018/19 as Anita's side reached the Dutch Cup final where they were soundly beaten by former club Ajax.
 A return to Leeds was brief as the two parties agreed to a mutual termination of his contract in September 2019.
 It meant Anita had to train alone before joining Bulgarian side CSKA Sofia in February this year. He managed just three appearances, though, before the coronavirus hit and he found himself out of contract again over the summer.
 Anita returned to the Netherlands and agreed terms with Eredivisie outfit RKC Waalwijk, whose manager Fred Grim had worked with the 31-year-old in Ajax's youth system.

As he responded to the crisis, his initial steps were tentative and doubtful. Sanwo-Olu is a good man but the demand of the office he occupies is like a ton of bricks on the head of anyone – heavy, painful and stressful. When he addressed the media, he appeared worried, rattled, disconsolate and disconnected. Who wouldn’t be? He appealed to Lagosians to embrace peace, but at that time, the city was literally on fire.

Basketball season is over, but it doesn't mean fans can't still get their basketball fix. _Benedict Men_ is a new Quibi docuseries that focuses on the St. Benedict's Preparatory School boys basketball team in New Jersey. Ahead of the unfortunate news that Quibi is shuttering, PopCulture.com had a chance to speak with _Benedict Men_ creator Mike Basone, and he revealed why he wanted to tell the story of one of the top basketball programs in the country.
 "It's a story that's much larger than basketball," Basone said. "Whenever I'm looking at doing sports documentaries, the sport is really a Trojan horse to tell a much greater story about humanity, about characters and societal issues that are going on." St. Benedict's is an all-boys school with a basketball program that has won multiple state championships and is constantly ranked as one of the top 25 basketball programs in the country. The team's core belief is "Whatever hurts my brother, hurts me," and that motto is put to the test throughout the season. The 12-part series on Quibi focuses on the team throughout the 2018-19 season and its quest to win a state title -- as well as the trials and tribulations the players go through on a daily basis on and off the court.
 "Each one of them are going through different things in their life," Basone said when talking about the players. "We're able to touch on the different scenes that are happening in society. Our story is a basketball story and high-level basketball... These kids have that burden on their shoulders. They fight through it."
 Die-hard basketball fans will recognize a few of the players in _Benedict Men_. C.J. Wilcher, a freshman guard at Xavier, was a co-captain for St. Benedict's. Aaron Estrada, the MAAC Rookie of the Year after a standout season at St. Peter's, is also featured on the show. But all fans will recognize three-time NBA Champion Steph Curry, an executive producer of the series who is also a narrator.
 "We were extremely excited when Steph decided to come on board," Basone said. "He was our first choice. His brand, his message just lined up so perfectly with the story we were trying to tell. He is an amazing man, an amazing basketball player and we were just so happy to work with him and the process was a joy." _Benedict Men_ , which is available to stream now on Quibi, is produced by Team Whistle which has shows on NBC, HBO Max, TBS, The CW and Facebook Watch.

BB: Well, watching Buffalo, there's a lot of familiarity with the team, but at the same time, it's a new team. They've made some changes in the offseason and you can see this team continue to grow. The general manager and head coach have done a good job. [Brandon] Beane and [Sean] McDermott have done a good job of putting the team together and they're obviously playing well. They're a very explosive team offensively, very explosive in the kicking game, and defensively, they are the same defense that Coach McDermott's had going back to Carolina and Buffalo – fundamentally sound, aggressive, do a good job turning the ball over. They have a good variety of schemes that keep you off- balance. So, they're pretty solid all the way across the board, and they've added a couple free agents – [Tyler] Matakevich, [Taiwan] Jones, obviously [Stefon] Diggs – that have helped their team, along with some young players that continue to improve and develop. So, yeah, back in the division. Looking forward to this week of preparation and the opportunity to go up there to Buffalo and compete against the Bills on Sunday, so this will be a good week for us

 The project was a recommended amendment to LUB’s capital work program.
 Board member Tim Dixon brought forward concerns from residents about whether the streets would be promptly repaired after being torn up for the project.
 “There’s not a complete repaving plan associated with this, but the cuts that are made will be completely filled in as Highland Avenue,” Ross said.
 Board chairman Don Campbell clarified the trenches left by construction will be covered with pavement.
 “Wherever they dig a trench, there will be pavement. It will be smooth,” Campbell said. “Now, it will be put on a paving schedule. At some point in time, it’ll get paved.”
 Board members Bart Watson and Gene Farmer motioned and seconded, respectively, to authorize the replacement. The vote passed unanimously.
 Members of the Grove Place Homeowners Association Board of Directors were present at the meeting.
 Linda McNabb and Judy Smallen, HOA board members, have lived in the neighborhood 17 years and 25 years, respectively.
 Smallen is “thankful” to soon see the problem solved.
 “I’ve been there 17 (years). For the last 15 years, it’s probably ongoing every few months,” McNabb said. “Sometimes there’s two days in a row (with leaks or breaks) in different locations.”
 Since May 29, there have been 10 leaks or breaks in the residential area. McNabb and the board have been working to get the issue resolved for nearly a decade.
 LUB employees some days would have to come out to the same leak three times in one day because it kept breaking, Smallen said.
 “It was just ongoing. The workers have been so good,” McNabb said. “They just come anytime we call and repair, but they said they were tired of it, too. On the Fourth of July, I was out of town, and when I got home, (Smallen) had found a leak in my yard. They were digging up my yard on the Fourth of July. It was about 8 o’clock at night. She saw the leak. It was just spewing out of the ground.”

ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Greek authorities on Wednesday arrested the captain of a Portuguese-flagged cargo ship that collided with a Greek navy minehunter outside the country’s main port of Piraeus.
 The coast guard said the captain of the Maersk Launceston container vessel was arrested for alleged violations of the Greek penal code and of the International Regulations for the Prevention of Collisions at Sea.
 The Kallisto, a British-built vessel capable of sweeping and hunting mines, was cut in two in Tuesday’s collision, with much of its stern severed.
 Two of the 27 crew members on board were taken to a hospital with slight injuries. The rest were evacuated from the ship, which was towed to a nearby navy base.
 No damage was reported to the Maersk Launceston, which is managed by the Germany-based company John T. Essberger, and no injuries were reported among the ship's 22 crew members.
 In a statement Wednesday, the company said Greek authorities interviewed the cargo ship’s crew and have officially charged the ship’s captain. Greek authorities requested for the ship to remain in port, and a company representative was providing support to the ship’s master and crew.
 “The exact details of the incident which took place early on Tuesday, October 27 are yet unclear. Greek authorities are continuing their investigations, to which John T. Essberger will offer its full cooperation,” the company said in its statement. “Managers again would like to express their concern over the injuries of the crew of Kallisto, wishing them a speedy recovery.”
 The container vessel had been heading from Piraeus to the Turkish port of Canakkale when the collision occurred.
