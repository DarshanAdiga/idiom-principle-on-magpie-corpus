By Abhishek Goenka In the holiday-shortened last week, the rupee made a hazy start at 74.44 and weakened towards 74.63. This weakness was primarily due to aggressive dollar buying by nationalized banks along with ongoing fears related to Covid-19. Markets were initially euphoric on the announcement of two vaccines which boosted the sentiments. This euphoria has been slowly fading away as the vaccines have its own set of logistical requirements of transportation, preservation, and distribution. Towards the end of the week, USDINR changed its direction and appreciated towards 74.10, closing the week at 74.16 due to broad dollar weakness and suspected foreign inflows. US Dollar Index weakened throughout the week on reports that US Senate Republican leaders have agreed to resume negotiations on another coronavirus stimulus package. In a bid to prevent the rupee’s appreciation, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been regularly buying dollars, absorbing the surge in foreign fund flows. Foreign equity inflows this month rose to Rs 49426 crore while forex reserves swelled by $4.277 billion to a lifetime high of $572.771 billion. It looks like the central bank is not in the mood to allow USDINR to appreciate sharply. In the coming days, the rupee is expected to weaken slightly considering the new restrictions imposed in Mumbai along with other parts of India. Moreover, global equities too look dim on the back of weak global cues due to rising coronavirus infections in the western world and on-off stimulus talks. On the flipside, a lot of inflows and IPOs are expected to grace the markets. Data shows that compared to other emerging markets, India was the only economy that received positive net inflows for Rs 10,107 crore over the 12-month period from October 2019 to September 2020. This trend is expected to continue as the Indian equity market has recovered as one of the fastest compared to other global markets. USDINR is expected to trade within a range of 73.50 – 75.00 levels. On the upside, break of 74.95 could push it to 75.40 level. On the down side, a break below 74.00 could push the currency towards 73.80. (The author is Founder and CEO, IFA Global. Views are his own)

In “Hillbilly Elegy,” Ron Howard looks deep into the heart of an American family torn apart by drug use and poverty and what he sees staring back is hope. He’s Ron Howard, how can he not? But that overarching sense of optimism is part of the reason the movie never connects.
 Here we have Amy Adams and Glenn Close, in bad wigs and worse clothes, getting down and dirty in showy grabs for awards season attention. Adams is Bev, a nurse in Middletown, Ohio, a backwater town where the closed-up factories are a Bruce Springsteen song come to life. Close is Mamaw, her mother, who has a profane comeback for anything that’s said in her general direction, but believes in family and tough love above all.
 They yell, they kick, they scream, they fight. It’s a redneck soap opera turned to 11. But Howard being Howard, there is light at the end of the tunnel, and “Hillbilly Elegy” becomes a hey-they-might-be-screwed-up-but- that’s-my-family-you’re-talking-about yarn about overcoming but also embracing the circumstances from whence you came.

DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) — A Florida woman has been sentenced to five years in prison for what authorities say was the accidental fatal shooting of her boyfriend more than two years ago. The Daytona Beach News- Journal reported Saturday that a Volusia County judge imposed the sentence on 45-year-old Tammy Almond for a manslaughter conviction. She had faced up to 30 years behind bars, but her attorneys worked out a deal with prosecutors. Authorities say Almond killed 56-year-old Darryl Wilson in June 2018 with a shotgun she had found at a home where the couple was house sitting. Almond insisted she did not realize the weapon was loaded. Wilson’s family had wanted Almond to be sentenced to seven years in prison. Since she has spend more than two years in jail since the shooting, Almond will likely serve about two years and six months more.

A man has died after being attacked by a shark in Western Australia, marking the eighth fatality in the country this year. Police were called to Cable Beach, a popular tourist spot on Australia&rsquo;s Indian Ocean coast, at about 8.40am.The man, 55, was pulled from the water with serious injuries and treated by police before paramedics arrived. He died at the scene, police said.Police said later that they shot at the shark, which lingered close to the shore, for almost half an hour after the attack.The species of the shark was not immediately confirmed, but locals told reporters it may have been a tiger shark, which are sometimes drawn close to the shore by shoals of small fish.Kimberley District Office police inspector Gene Pears told reporters that the victim had been body boarding about 30 to 40 metres from the beach when he was attacked.A couple on the beach saw thrashing in the water and rushed to drag the man to safety. The man suffered injuries to his leg and hand.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a tragic incident, very unexpected, a person going out to have a bit of fun in the water,&rdquo; Mr Pears said.Park rangers immediately closed the beach and a fisheries vessel was assigned to patrol the area.The victim was the eighth to die in a shark attack in Australia this year, the highest toll since 1929 when nine died.The introduction of shark nets at popular beaches in the 1930s led to a significant fall in fatal attacks.The most recent previous attack in Western Australia occurred on October 9, when a surfer was taken by a shark at Esperance on the state&rsquo;s south coast.Companions saw the man, Andrew Sharpe, dragged from his board. His body was not found despite a three-day search but his surfboard and parts of his wetsuit were located.Broome, near where the latest shark attack took place, is about 1,000 miles north of Western Australia&rsquo;s largest city, Perth.

" The remarkable increase in visitor numbers demonstrates the relevance of U.AE and efficiency of its team in providing information of interest to all segments of the UAE community. U.AE has contributed to the continuity of business amid the current circumstance, by providing a significant number of e-services, and providing a broad range of information needed by UAE residents or visitors.
 Through its four sections, U.AE covers key topics about the UAE, including information, services, e-participation and media. Section one covers UAE’s history, economy, political system, government, plans, strategies and initiatives. The ‘Information and Services’ section incorporates topics of employment, investment, tourism, infrastructure and visa systems, as well as a full list of all government services in the country. The E-participation section includes channels of communication with the UAE government, advisory platforms, live chat, etc.
 Given the current exceptional circumstances the world is going through, a number of new topics were added to enrich the portal with information dealing with the pandemic, such as travel procedures, return of residents from abroad, visas provisions and entry permits in light of COVID-19, in addition to topics of supporting the labor market in the private sector during the COVID-19 outbreak. Plus, government services are accessible around the clock, with UAE PASS replacing SmartPass.
 The official portal of the UAE Government (U.AE) was launched on 24 May 2011 by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, to act as a single window for online information and services provided by Federal and local UAE entities to individuals, visitors and business owners.

Oh, by the way, it rained consistently throughout the match, the wind was swirling, the surface was like an ice rink and the ball resembled a bar of soap.
 To boot, Wales had lost their last six matches and there are calls for their head coach to be sacked.
 The backline that finished the match had 52 caps between including the Georgia game itself. Rhys Webb had 35 of those.
 What was to be expected, Barbarians rugby? No wonder they lacked fluidity.
 A bit of inclement weather, you might say, should not have such a significant impact on the performance of professional athletes. And I would tend to agree to a point.
 But nobody who was at ground would deny that the conditions would have stifled any team to a degree, let alone one that harboured such unfamiliarity and inexperience.
 The forward pack is not being mentioned here because, by most accounts they were pretty good, securing set piece ball and largely getting on top. Four of the front five are good bets to remain next week, with Alun Wyn Jones coming in for Seb Davies, which is not a slight on the latter's performance.
 But most of the criticism of Wales revolved around their attack, which is why we're focusing on that.
 They didn’t set the world on fire but they were never going to. It was deeply naive to expect anything more than what transpired – a win and some valuable experience for some potential superstars who are likely to be part of this team for some time.
 That’s all this exercise was about.
 The fact that a number of players put their hands up for selection against England next week is a bonus.

Nebraska has worked diligently to earn its reputation as the “Silicon Prairie” in part because of our state’s record attracting tech companies and leveraging the innovation and employment they bring. Our state’s leaders should keep capitalizing on the pro-business pedigree our state is building. Instead of pursuing misguided actions like the U.S. Department of Justice’s Google lawsuit, officials should be boosting efforts to attract more companies to move to our state and encouraging more startups to take root and grow.
 The benefits of tech companies moving to Nebraska and successful homegrown tech companies are obvious: Higher wages, jobs and increasing national stature as a tech-friendly state. On the other hand, the benefits of suing or regulating Google, or others in the tech ecosystem, don’t even register.

Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Sunday said that the Kerala Police Act will in no way be used against free speech or impartial journalism and apprehensions to the contrary are unfounded."The State Government was repeatedly receiving complaints against the wide misuse of social media, especially by certain online channels. Even prominent public and cultural figures had made such complaints. They have brought to the notice of the Government instances where inhuman and vile cyber attacks were carried out by some in the guise of journalism and how it even harmed the family lives of many. It has often turned into targeted attacks using untruths and even sleazy content. Many families are bearing the consequences of such attacks," Vijayan said, according to news agency ANI.He added that the use of personal likes or dislikes, political or non-political interests which can unsettle the peaceful atmosphere, and those being used to settle scores arising out of revenge cannot be allowed."In several instances, such cyber attacks have resulted in heart-wrenching tragedies. Such attacks that are carried out without hearing the side of those who are being attacked do not fall under the category of journalism. They are simply personal vendetta in action. Many a time, monetary interests are behind such devious designs," he added.Vijayan further said that along with ensuring the freedom of the press, the government also has the responsibility of upholding a citizen's individual freedom and his/her dignity as enshrined in the Constitution. The popular idea that one's freedom ends where the other's nose begins needs to be respected. One has the liberty to swing one's fist, but it ends where the other's nose begins. However, there have been instances of this idea being repeatedly violated," he added.Asserting that in the name of freedom of the press, individual freedom cannot be violated, Vijayan said in the name of individual freedom, the freedom of the press cannot be violated. "The government is duty-bound to protect both. It is in this context that even at the international level measures are being put in place against the infringement of personal dignity. The amendment in the Kerala Police Act is only those that are in tune with such measures," he added. The Kerala CM said a person's respect and dignity are essential in modern society, adding that it has constitutional validation as well. "The government has the responsibility to ensure it. In general, traditional media functions within these constitutional limits. However, certain online media have scant regard for such constitutional provisions and behave as if anything goes, creating an atmosphere of anarchy. This will alter our social order, and it cannot be allowed,"he added. "Within the contours of our Constitution and the legal framework, everybody has the right to make the strongest criticisms. The new amendment will not hamper that freedom in any way. If seen in a positive light, no one can perceive infringement of freedom in it. Only those who think that it is their freedom to wreak havoc in others' lives, can see this as an affront on their freedom. And that is not something that modern society would allow anywhere in the world," said the Kerala CM. He further added, "Personal defamation and attack on dignity have even resulted in suicides and it has been brought to the attention of the Government by those in responsible positions. In such circumstances, the Government cannot simply ignore it. Our effort to ensure the respect and dignity of each individual should not create any apprehension in the minds of the media and the general public. The amendment only has clauses that are in tune with the sections that ensure the freedom of the press and individual liberty."Vijayan said the amendment has been introduced also in the context of the cyber- attacks being faced by women and transgenders, adding that the government will certainly consider all creative opinions and suggestions that are being aired with regard to this amendment.Amid resistance from the opposition parties, Kerala Governor Arif Muhammad Khan has signed the Kerala Police Act amendment ordinance.The law aims to stop bullying, insulting or disgracing individuals through any content and circulating the same through any communication medium. The offenders will be awarded a sentence of three years/penalty of Rs 10,000 or both.(With inputs from ANI)

ABU DHABI, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News / WAM - 22nd Nov, 2020) The General Authority for Regulating the Telecommunications Sector, TRA, announced that official portal of the UAE Government (U.AE) has hit a new record in its number of users, reaching nearly the 10 million mark during the period from January to October of this year, an 50.73 percent increase over 2019, where the number of users in the same period was 6.54 million.
 During January-October 2020, U.AE saw an increase in its number of users from abroad by about 3 million users, compared to 2 million during the same period of 2019, a 22.37 percent increase in the current year over the previous one. India came first in number of users from abroad, followed by Saudi Arabia, Egypt, United States, and finally the United Kingdom.
 Such results reflect, in part, the tremendous efforts by the portal team in content and service development. They also reflect the change in user choices as a result of the status quo where online activities witness a significant increase such as working remotely, distance learning, browsing, searching for information on websites and accessing government services remotely through the official portal, which provides many prompt government services accessible around the clock.
 U.AE serves citizens, residents, visitors and investors by providing all information on government developments, laws, policies, services and trends. It is characterised by being the world’s only portal with a domain name consisting of one letter "U", which refers to self "You" and carries meanings of union and uniqueness that characterize the UAE.
 Commenting on this remarkable progress in portal visits, Salem Al Housani, Acting Deputy Director General of the Information and mGovernment Sector, said: "U.AE serves as Primary reference for people seeking information and government services in general.

Conditions get tough for managing livestock in the winter. It can be stressful for animals, farmers, and our natural resources. Let’s consider steps to dramatically decrease cold snap stress.
 If a farmer can cut the wind and give his animals a solid place to land their feet, our winter temps will cause little stress. If relatively dry with a barrier against bitter wind, our animals like 15 degrees F, better than 90 degrees.
 Start by looking for or creating a “high and dry” area for the animals. This means there will be very little surface runoff flowing into the place where livestock are kept. Runoff could come from up-slope areas or surrounding building roofs. If a location does have significant watershed sending storm- water runoff through, consider a simple diversion above the livestock area. The conservation district can help size a diversion channel that can carry water safely without causing erosion. If near-by roofs contribute water, gutters or in-ground drains under the eaves can dramatically improve livestock holding areas.
