 # System upgrades to temporarily limit customer assistance
 Donnie Z. Fetter
 The Dispatch
 To better serve customers, the Times-News in Burlington and The Dispatch in Lexington soon will upgrade their distribution systems. But the upgrading process will leave the publications with limited capacities for a week.
 The upgrades begin Oct. 26 and continue through Nov. 2. During that time, employees at the publications will be unable to assist customers with placing holds on newspaper delivery, make payments via telephone, etc.
 Any customers expecting to need any such distribution service should contact the papers this week; Burlington at 336-229-2444 and Lexington at 336-248-5980.
 Transactions will resume as normal starting Nov. 2. We appreciate your patience and thank you for subscribing.
