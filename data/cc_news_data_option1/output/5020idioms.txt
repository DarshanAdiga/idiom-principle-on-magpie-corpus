UNESCO IICBA has been supporting peace education for the prevention of violence and violent extremism since 2017, with the support of the government of Japan. Peace is one of the African Union’s top priorities. Aspiration 4 of Agenda 2063 emphasizes that “a culture of peace and tolerance shall be nurtured in Africa’s children and youth through peace education.” The Continental Education Strategy for Africa (CESA) 2016-2025 calls for peace education and safeguarding education in times of emergencies, and ensuring safe teaching and learning environments. “Silencing the Guns of Africa by the Year 2020” is an important and relevant theme of the African Union, and it has become much more urgent in the health crisis of COVID-19. The pandemic might exacerbate the risk of conflict across many contexts due to its economic, educational, and emotional ramifications.

Equity benchmark Sensex rallied 347 points to end at its fresh lifetime peak on Monday, tracking gains in index majors HDFC, HUL and ICICI Bank amid unabated foreign fund inflows.


  After touching a record intra-day high of 45,458.92, the 30-share BSE index settled 347.42 points or 0.77 per cent higher at 45,426.97.


  Similarly, the broader NSE Nifty rose 97.20 points or 0.73 per cent to an all-time closing high of 13,355.75. It touched its record intra-day peak of 13,366.65 in early trade.


  Bharti Airtel was the top gainer in the Sensex pack, rising around 3 per cent, followed by HUL, HDFC, ITC, IndusInd Bank, SBI, Sun Pharma, ONGC, Tech Mahindra, L&T and Asian Paints.


  On the other hand, Kotak Bank, Nestle India, Tata Steel, Bajaj Finance and HDFC Bank were among the laggards.


  "Domestic equities remained resilient and defied the weak global markets," said Binod Modi, Head-Strategy at Reliance Securities.


  Strong buying was seen across the pack towards the end of the day and thus Nifty gained for the fifth consecutive day. Volatility index once again declined reflecting little risk of ongoing rally, he added.


  "Positive progress on Covid-19 vaccination and RBI's strong commitment to support economy recovery are supporting market rally. Further, increased visibility of fiscal stimulus in the US with weak dollar may continue to attract FPIs into emerging markets including India," he stated.


  Elsewhere in Asia, bourses in Shanghai, Hong Kong and Tokyo ended in the red, while Seoul finished with gains.


  Stock exchanges in Europe were largely trading with losses in early deals.


  Meanwhile, the global oil benchmark Brent crude futures slipped 1.02 per cent to USD 48.75 per barrel.

Important Caveat: The figures should be seen as market estimates, as opposed to historical records, as these are forecasted for the current year of trade. More importantly, in light of the fact that unforeseeable factors might interrupt markets in achieving their reported levels, the figures should be seen as estimates of potential. For example, “mad cow” disease, foot-and-mouth disease, trade embargoes, labor disputes, military conflicts, acts of terrorism, and other events will certainly affect the actual trade flows recorded for a variety of industry or product categories. In such cases, the difference between the numbers given in this report and the numbers actually observed might be interpreted as the “net loss” or “net gain” due to these exogenous events affecting regular trade flows that would have occurred had these events not have taken place.

Kedarnath, released in 2018, went on to garner a loyal and strong fanbase over the years. Director Abhishek Kapoor pens a heartfelt note as his passion project marks two glorious years and chronicles the story behind making the film, how it changed him, missing Sushant, and more. You want to always try and do some relevant stories. India has so many people, it is such a populated country, so value for human life is kind of minimised. So, when the floods in Kedarnath hit, it was such a massive catastrophe. So many thousand people died and it just shook me up. I felt that someone has to address that and it also gave me the opportunity to do Bholenath ke darshan, which was the best part of the film. I got to know him, I got to feel him and today I have a very unique relationship with him. I have so many fond memories. It was such an incredible experience. Log pure desh se, chhote chhote gaanv mein se aate hain wahan pe, itni kathinaayion se aate hain, itni aashayein lekar aate hain ki wahan pe pahunchenge. And they all have so much to share with their god koi kuch maangne aata hai, koi shukriyada dene aata hai. For thousands of years, people have been going there with such vibrations and depositing it over there. I mean, when you re there, you can feel it. So, it s just a blessing to have had the opportunity to make the film. But having said that, it wasn t easy at all. Because the weather, the conditions, the terrain are unforgiving. So, you have to be relentless and it was like a yatra in itself. When I cast Sushant in Kai Po Che, I had never seen any of his work earlier. He was just an absolutely brand new boy for me. He was so sincere. He spoke very little and he gave so much. And he was very generous. And he was not entitled. I ve worked with all kinds of newcomers but he did not have an iota of entitlement that many other newcomers seem to carry. Now we re completing two years and it feels like I have so many memories with him. But still it feels so empty. You know, when you work with an actor and you introduce the actor into the film business, you put a lot of heart and soul into him. You create something that is a contribution to the film industry. A lot of movies are made with that actor and then an entire ecosystem is generated on that actor, so it s a contribution of a filmmaker when he or she does that. And, suddenly, when he s not there today, I feel a massive vacuum and pain. Making, telling stories gives me great joy. I ve worked very hard on my scripts and my characters. And so it becomes imperative that I get good actors. Sometimes, actors are already established, seasoned actors, and sometimes, they are new. And when an actor comes in and shines, that s pure joy, it s almost a paternal feeling. It s like your child has delivered.

India captain Virat Kohli on Sunday said winning the T20 series against Australia without established players like Rohit Sharma and Jasprit Bumrah meant a great deal to him and lavished praise on the marauding Hardik Pandya s raw talent . Pandya struck an unbeaten 22 ball 42 to take India home with six wickets in hands in the second T20 International and help the visitors take a 2 0 unassailable lead in the three match rubber here. Yeah meant a great deal. We ve played as a team in T20 cricket. The fact that we don t have Rohit and Bumrah, our established white ballplayers, in and still doing well makes me happy and I am very proud of this team, Kohli said after the win. While Rohit has missed the series because of a hamstring injury he suffered during this year s IPL, Bumrah has been rested from the T20 matches keeping in mind the upcoming four Test series against Australia. The India skipper believes that with his raw talent, Pandya, who earned the man of the match award for his batting, can become a bankable player for the team in years to come. The reason for him Hardik coming into the team in 2016 was pure ability. He has raw talent. And now he realises that this is his time, the next 4 5 years, to be that bankable player that can win you games from anywhere. His plans are right and I m glad to see that, Kohli said. He now realises that this is the time to establish in that finishing role and play match winning knocks for us. He plays with all his heart and he certainly got that competitive nature about him and also has the skill to execute that at the highest level. Kohli said the players put up a team effort to bounce back in the T20 series after losing the ODI rubber 1 2. He credited the IPL for making India a formidable T20 outfit. Everyone has played 14 games at least, recently, so they know what their plans are. Natarajan was outstanding and Shardul was good today. Hardik finishing off the game and Shikhar getting that fifty, it s a whole team effort, he said. We kept them to a total which we thought was quite chaseable with the short boundary. It s contributions from the whole team that make you feel better because young players are taking their opportunities. Australia s stand in skipper Matthew Wade, who led in place of an injured Aaron Finch on Sunday, felt despite posting 194 5 on the board, the hosts were a few runs short of a par score. He also rued poor execution from his bowlers while defending the target. It was good fun to be captain , a lot more fun till Hardik came out. I think we might have been a little short not a lot, but then it doesn t matter when Hardik is in this sort of form . Unfortunately, we didn t execute well towards the end with the ball. When you get a start like that you want to push but I was disappointed with the way I got out and the timing of my wicket as well, said Wade, who made 58 off 32 balls after opening the innings. India had won the first T20 by 11 runs in Canberra. The final match of the series will be played here on Tuesday.

Emma, a stay-at-home mum, had no problems during her pregnancy until the 20-week scan when doctors noticed Lexi was missing her right arm.
 After running tests they concluded Lexi was completely healthy otherwise and couldn’t find a reason for the missing appendage.
 The concerned mum was closely monitored through the pregnancy until Lexi arrived safely on 14th October 2010 at North Staffordshire Hospital.
 Emma said: “There was no rhyme or reason – Lexi just never developed the arm.

The UK is sending its largest warship, aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth, and its strike task group to the Indian Ocean early next year for its maiden voyage, with London describing the move as the country's "most ambitious deployment for two decades". The deployment comes against the backdrop of growing interest in the Indo-Pacific in Europe amid concerns over China's increased assertiveness, and the UK's own concerns over Chinese actions in its former colony of Hong Kong, which London says have undermined the agreement on leaving the region unchanged until 2047. Also read | Britain gets ready for roll-out of Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine this week"Next year, HMS Queen Elizabeth will lead a British and allied task group on the UK's most ambitious deployment for two decades, its route will encompass the Mediterranean, the Indian Ocean and East Asia," a British high commission spokesperson said. "It is a natural choice for the inaugural deployment of the carrier strike task group to include a visit to the Indian Ocean and East Asia. The deployment is a sign of the UK's commitment to regional security," the spokesperson added. France, Germany and the Netherlands have unveiled their strategies for the Indo-Pacific, which dovetail with India's commitment to freedom of navigation and a rules-based order, and some experts see the deployment of Britain's carrier task group as an effort to reinforce its relevance amid Brexit. The British mission's spokesperson described the Indo- Pacific as "increasingly important for the UK, as it is at the centre of global economic growth and a region of increasing geostrategic importance". The UK has a "range of enduring security interests in the region", the spokesperson said. The spokesperson also described the UK and India as "natural partners in defence" that "already have high levels of interoperability", as is evident from bi-annual exercises involving all three services and their joint work on the UN peacekeeping mission in South Sudan. The 65,000-tonne HMS Queen Elizabeth, which can carry up to 40 aircraft, was commissioned in late 2017 but next year's deployment will mark its maiden voyage in international waters. The carrier task group is expected to conduct joint exercises with the US Navy and Japan's Self-Defense Forces, though it couldn't immediately be confirmed if there are plans for similar drills with the Indian Navy. The British mission's spokesperson said the Royal Navy and the Indian Navy have "strong bilateral ties" and training together under the Konkan Exercise, a bilateral drill held biennially. "The strong maritime relationship with India and other regional partners, regular deployments and a permanent naval presence provides the ability for the UK government to react quickly to a variety of emerging security and humanitarian situations with partners, as well as upholding international maritime law in support of the rules-based international system," the spokesperson said. The UK has a long- standing presence in the Gulf and Indian Ocean through Operation Kipion, which now involves the permanent presence of seven warships at any time, typically one frigate or destroyer supported by a tanker and a four-strong squadron of mine-hunters with a support ship. The British side also pointed to the Royal Navy's increasing presence in the Indian Ocean, where HMS Dragon warship seized drugs with a street value of more than £200 million during operations last year. These operations are backed by maritime information exchanges such as a white shipping agreement with India covering the whole Indian Ocean. Sameer Patil, fellow for international security studies at Gateway House, said the British naval deployment should be seen in light of two factors - the UK's efforts to remain relevant amid its exit from the European Union, and Britain's concerns over China's crackdown on Hong Kong. "The UK has a key presence in the Indian Ocean through the Diego Garcia base that is leased to the US. The British naval deployment shows the importance of the region, especially when other European countries are taking the lead in this area," he said.

ADRIAN -- There's been a lot of businesses at 110 E. Maumee St. over the years.


   


  It's been a hardware store, a bookstore, a tea room, a shop for menswear, even Adrian College's business offices at one time. Most recently it was Ricketts, Ricketts & Associates.


   


  The building has changed hands numerous times, but its occupants have always been a part of the Adrian downtown community. Always.


   


  Or at least as far back as historical records go. The earliest picture of 110 E. Maumee St. is from 1856.


   


  A local trio is leaning into the community fixture concept with The Buzz Cafe and Marketplace, one of downtown's newest businesses. A cafe and grab-and-go market hybrid, The Buzz opened Nov. 28.


   


  The shop offers soups made from scratch along with salads, sandwiches, Great Lakes Roasting Co. coffee and breakfast fare. There are also gluten-free bread options.


   


  The grilled cheese and tomato soup combo has been an early favorite.


   


  The Buzz is the end result of a three-year construction project and an even longer planning phase for owners Joyce Miller and Ben and Deveny Rosebrock.


   


  Miller met the Rosebrocks when she co-owned Sass. They met during First Fridays where the Rosebrocks would promote their business, Treat Handcrafted Confections.


   


  Miller had always wanted to have her own small business, maybe a coffeeshop. The Rosebrocks specialize in sweet treats. Coffee and chocolate? A perfect combo.


   


  Miller and her husband, Chris, Adrian's former economic development coordinator, purchased 110 E. Maumee and live upstairs. Together, along with the Rosebrocks and a few others, they would embark on what they call a "deconstruction" project.


   


  Plenty of sweat equity went into creating The Buzz.


   


  "When you walk in, you feel a little bit of the love we've put into this place," Ben Rosebrock said. "This space means more to us than the restaurant we've created."


   


  The building was gutted all the way down to the original floor boards, which is what customers see when they walk in. They are various shades of brown, some even black. A spot on the floor in the back says "1856 ... ish," a nod to the longstanding building.


   


  Ben learned how to clean bricks on the wall with a wire brush, one by one.


   


  A completely new facade features windows inviting those passing by to watch as Ben makes his signature fudge. A deliberate design move, the "performance area," as he calls it, is in the front of the shop.


   


  If that wasn't enticing enough, the vents are positioned in such a way that the chocolate aroma flows out and into downtown.


   


  A staircase was even removed from what is now the center of The Buzz and repurposed to lead to the basement. Tax prep service Ball D A Associates, a holdover tenant from before The Buzz, was given its own entrance at the back of the building, which required the removal of bricks. The staircase leads to the basement from that office.


   


  Much of what was removed was repurposed with some materials going to Goodwill and Lenawee County Habitat for Humanity. Other materials are on display inside The Buzz, such as the thick slabs of wood on top of the stools one can sit at if they want to have lunch while overlooking downtown.


   


  "There are some amazing timbers to come out of this place," Ben said.


   


  If one is looking for a more comfortable seat, there's a space to read and play board games, which will be available once The Buzz can offer dine-in.


   


  In the back is the marketplace. There's a little bit of everything, from fruits and toilet paper, to chips and jars of jam. Miller said the idea is based on what those who live and work downtown might need on their way home. Instead of an out-of-the-way store run, just pop on into The Buzz.


   


  The Buzz name is a double entendre. There's the "buzz" one gets from drinking a coffee and the "buzz" of being a community hub. Owners hope the latter flourishes once they fully open.


   


  Miller envisions customers coming and going while others chat over coffee or work on a laptop. No matter who stops in, owners want them to have a feeling of belonging. No off-putting looks or feelings of "Who are you?"


   


  A customer experience, not customer service, as Deveny describes it.


   


  The owners also want to promote other Adrian businesses. The Buzz staff will be trained to recommend a good place to have dinner, grab a drink or catch a show.


   


  Art featured on The Buzz's walls come from local artists and is for sale. The cafe has partnered with the Adrian Center for the Arts to serve as a show gallery.


   


  An old piano holds the coffee mugs for the shop's mug club. Purchase a one- year membership and receive a ceramic mug made by local artist Dennis Swartzlander along with coffee discounts.


   


  "It really is our mission to be a community organization," Ben said.


   


  One might say there's a buzz already. Feedback has been overwhelmingly positive and other businesses have given The Buzz a warm welcome.


   


  "It's been really, really great," Deveny said.


   


  The Buzz is open 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Thursday, 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Friday and Saturday and 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Sunday. The shop can be found on Facebook at The Buzz Cafe and Marketplace and online at thebuzzadrian.com.

Commercial roll out of the ambitious 5G technology in India has been in a hang for years now with the delay seemingly stretching over and beyond 2020 as well. While the industry has been in conflict with the government over what it contends as high pricing and scanty availability of the spectrum in the 3.3-3.6 GHz bands, the financial knockout on account of AGR has effectively made the operators incapable of bidding within this fiscal.
 Even though Airtel, Vodafone Idea, Jio and BSNL submitted applications to conduct field trials with DoT on January 15, industry experts still see 5G coming to India by 2022 since telcos having their balance sheets badly bruised lack monetary headroom to bid for the final auctions.
 In contrast, just two days before the new year, on December 30, the government allowed Chinese player Huawei (read all vendors) to conduct field trials in partnership with the telecom players. The move came after India’s prolonged silence over Huawei’s participation in 5G deployments in light of the United States pressing India to bar Huawei from deploying the network. India, however, finally took a position on the issue as it juggles to maintain strategic balance with two of its major trade partners--China and the US.

Indeed, the idea of placing communicable diseases under “surveillance" arose out of the US World War II experience, and “epidemic intelligence" as a discipline of public health was born amid the Cold War anxieties of biological warfare. Declassified archives of the Central Intelligence Agency reveal that it tracked the “Mao flu" pandemic of 1968-69 and advised policymakers that supplying China with medicines could be a way to break the ice in bilateral relations. Beyond the National Center for Medical Intelligence, which is part of the US Defence Intelligence Agency, the US intelligence community includes epidemiologists, mathematicians and other scientists who are involved in biological defence.

Oil prices slipped on Monday as the positive impact from Covid-19 vaccines and an OPEC+ deal on oil production cuts was undermined by surging coronavirus cases and heightened tensions between the United States and China.Brent crude fell 76 cents, or 1.5%, to $48.49 a barrel by 0911 GMT. US crude was down 82 cents, or 1.8%, at $45.44."Surging virus cases and a Reuters report signalling the United States is preparing new sanctions on Chinese officials ... outweighed the positive sentiment driven by vaccine news," said Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM.

While a number of actors have started shooting for various projects, everyone has had a challenging time handling Covid guidelines while on set. With standard operating procedures involving constant sanitization, PPE kits, masks on most of the time and what not, Kirti Kulhari, too, has been shooting maintaining all safety precautions. "I was super excited. I understand the Covid-19 situation. I also understand that getting back to normal life, with the precautions in place, is the way to go forward. We can't be sitting at home and not doing anything. It happened for a while and a long time during the lockdown. No one thought that three-four months would just pass by and we would still be at home. I am all for looking ahead and moving forward," says the Uri actor.  View this post on Instagram A post shared by Kirti Kulhari (@iamkirtikulhari) She is starting a few projects this month and has releases lined up in the coming months as well. Kulhari reveals that some projects got pushed because of Covid, including her web show Four More Shots Please! season 3. Talking about her experience of shooting initially, she shares, "Usually a 12-hour shift doesn't mean much as it is a regular thing. But, what happened on the first day of shoot which was that after five-six hours of shooting, I felt so tired as if I had shot for 24 hours. Everyone had gotten used to not working for months so being back on the set, it felt longer and tiring. It got me two days to feel and remember that I used to do this on a daily basis. I asked other co-actors who had shot more than me about feeling tired and they said that they too went through this in the first few days. I was glad to know that I was not the only one. There will be back-to-back shoots which I am looking forward to." Interact with author on Twitter/@iamkav

Two White House officials told CNN that while Trump had certainly considered firing Barr, he's being advised against it by several people.
 A former attorney general under President George H.W. Bush, Barr came out of semi-retirement in 2019 to take over the top job at the Justice Department after Trump dismissed former Attorney General Jeff Sessions from the role. Trump forced Sessions out in 2018 after Sessions recused himself from matters related to the 2016 campaign, including the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.
 Barr has faced accusations that he has politicized the Justice Department to defend Trump, by involving himself in the sentencing for Trump's friend Roger Stone and dropping federal charges against former national security adviser Michael Flynn.
 Trump has refused to concede the 2020 presidential, falsely claiming the election was riddled with fraud and stolen from him when more people voted for President-elect Joe Biden.
 Referring to allegations against Dominion and other voting software used in the 2020 election, Barr told the Associated Press, "There's been one assertion that would be systemic fraud and that would be the claim that machines were programmed essentially to skew the election results. And the DHS and DOJ have looked into that, and so far, we haven't seen anything to substantiate that."

With two games already canceled, the Buckeyes (5-0) must get in a sixth game under current conference rules to be eligible to play for a fourth consecutive Big Ten championship. But even that might be up in the air.
 The Big Ten could decide that Ohio State, even with only five games, will still represent the East Division in the Dec. 19 title game, at least in part because the conference doesn’t want to hurt the Buckeyes' chances of earning a national playoff berth.
 Ohio State is holding on to the fourth spot in the College Football Playoff rankings but could use a solid win in "The Game,” and a conference championship, to add to its resume and persuade the selection committee to keep it in front of Texas A&M (7-1) and Florida (8-1) despite playing fewer games.
 It promises to be an interesting week.
 Ohio State has had its own problems with the coronavirus. An outbreak in its facility led to the cancellation of the Nov. 28 game at Illinois. Among those taken out of action was coach Ryan Day, who had to stay home and watch the Michigan State game on TV.
 "I’m hoping the worst part is behind us and we can look forward," Day said Saturday.
 Ohio State's list of unavailable players included 23 names before the 52-12 drubbing of the Spartans (2-4). They included three starting offensive linemen and a starting linebacker. Three assistant coaches also were out.
 "I’m honestly surprised that I didn’t get it," said quarterback Justin Fields, who threw for two touchdowns and ran for two more. "I guess it was just God looking out for me. We were just glad we got the opportunity to play.”
 Michigan (2-4) reported an increased number of positive tests last week, leading to the cancellation of its game at Maryland. The size of the outbreak has not been disclosed by the school.
 Being forced to scrap the game in Columbus would be a sour end to a disappointing season for Wolverines coach Jim Harbaugh. So would another loss to the Buckeyes, who have won the rivalry game in each of Harbaugh's first five years at Michigan.
 A win, of course, would make things better for Harbaugh, who has one year left on his contract at the school he led as a quarterback in the mid-1980s.
 The Buckeyes beat Michigan 56-27 at the Big House last year in Day’s first game as head coach in the series and extended their winning streak over the Wolverines to eight straight.
 Day said he was proud of how the Buckeyes moved past the rough, uncertain week to dominate Michigan State. Defensive line coach Larry Johnson was the stand- in for Day, with offensive coordinator Kevin Wilson calling the plays that produced 521 yards.
 "It was rough," said running back Trey Sermon, who rushed for 112 yards and a touchdown, his best day since transferring to Ohio State from Oklahoma in the offseason. "But (as) our coaches were saying - it’s adversity, we’re going to face it.”
 Said Fields: "This week really brought us together as a team.”

But this Christmas is not the same. It is a pandemic Christmas where death is already setting new records. Nearly 2,900 lives were lost in a single day last week, roughly equivalent to a 9/11 every 24 hours. The CDC says COVID-19 may have claimed nearly 330,000 of us by Dec. 26. Health care workers are physically and emotionally spent; the system is cracking under the strain.


  And so this is Christmas.


  But what is Christmas when you can't -- or at least, shouldn't -- travel? To go over the river and through the woods to grandma's house this year is to risk exposing her to a deadly virus. Yet any year that denies you the ability to go home, to gather in a place of memory with those you love, is a year that steals something irreplaceable. That's why carols written during World War II brim with such palpable yearning.


  "I'll be home for Christmas, if only in my dreams..."


  "Next year, all our troubles will be out of sight..."

There will be a live full cast Zoom reading of City of Tomorrow on Friday, December 18 and Saturday, December 19. Planned to be part of the celebrations to mark the WGC centenary, the Barn was scheduled to open the play's run with a charity preview back in April, in aid of Herts Young Homeless. Then came lockdown. Poet and playwright Glyn Maxwell grew up in Guessens Road where, in the 90s, the family garden became the stage for his early productions, when audiences included actor Michael Sheen, Greg Doran, now artistic director of the RSC, and poet Simon Armitage. Maxwell's work has since been staged in London and New York. His epic poem Time's Fool, a 20th century rail-borne reincarnation of The Flying Dutchman, is currently being written for screen. There's no release date yet, but it will be directed by Paul King, director of the Paddington films. His poetry book, How the Hell Are You, has been shortlisted for the T.S. Eliot Prize, which will be announced in January. City of Tomorrow, Maxwell's lyrical play about Welwyn Garden City, was originally commissioned in 2011 by Brigid Lamar, then artistic director of the Watford Palace Theatre, and revived in 2014 to mark the centenary of the birth of Dylan Thomas and in homage to Under Milk Wood. It takes place at the town's birthday celebrations, where Adam, a well-meaning schoolboy from the posh side of town, encounters Gemma, sarcastic, unimpressed from the wrong side of the tracks. As they wander through their strange green birthplace, quarrelling and flirting and pretending they don't care, they start to hear voices from those hundred years of English life, from the innocent early days of dances and drama clubs, through the pre-war Blackshirts, the Blitz, and refugees, to the fading of community, the rise of celebrity culture, and the longer shadows of modern life. Last year, when the WGC centenary committee asked him to write something to celebrate Welwyn Garden City's 100 years, he "took it down from the shelf and started rewriting it for 2020". "We were two weeks into rehearsing when the pandemic arrived and sent us all into isolation," said Maxwell. "We may be able to present it on stage in 2021, or maybe not until 2022, but we felt strongly that it should have its moment in the light during the anniversary year 2020. "So, we decided that the best - possibly only - way to present City of Tomorrow in 2020 was to do a live Zoom reading of it, which is scheduled for Friday, December 18 and Saturday, December 19." With the cast of 15, all reading from their homes, that feels like an ambitious undertaking, but he's not fazed. "The vagaries of a live performance, with the considerable risk of glitches, is worth it for the sense of festive communal fun and ceremonial occasion. "Hopefully we can do it to a high standard and so tell the story in the year it was intended. "I think two live events close to Christmas, marking both the town's 100th and Barn's 50th, will be very cheering for the wider community, and more fun than doing a Zoom recording. "We'll also ask for donations to help the Barn recover from the months of darkness." Barn actor\/directors, Danny Swanson and Jan Palmer Sayer, bring their Zoom theatre experience to the production, with expert help on the technical side from John Cook who, along with the rest of his profession, has not been on stage for a while, and likes the idea of a live performance. "We're on a rollercoaster together," he said, "we get off at the interval, and then we all get back on again."

 “We all know Liverpool is a very good team, mostly because they are really efficient; almost every chance and every opportunity ended up as a goal, which we could maybe learn from because in the first-half, if we’d have crossed the ball better or given the last ball better, that might have been a goal.

Sports across the world have resumed in front of limited or no crowds, but the vaccines have provided hope that crowds can return in large numbers from next year.
 "The introduction of the vaccine and the rollout of the vaccine, it’s definitely good news for everybody,” 2022 World Cup chief executive Nasser Al- Khater said in an interview with AP. "Everybody’s looking forward to going back to some sort of normalcy in life and especially in sports as well.
 "We’re very hopeful and very looking forward that, by 2022, hopefully things will really be back to complete normal and looking forward to hosting the fans and having a normal and successful World Cup.”
 European nations on Monday will discover their path to securing one of 13 spots in the tournament when the qualifying draw is staged at FIFA HQ in Zurich. The pandemic has prevented the event being staged in the host nation as would usually happen before a World Cup.
 "In the post-COVID pandemic era, we hope that sports will go back to normal as quickly as possible,” Al-Khater said.
 The tournament isn't just going to a new region, but being played at the end of 2022 rather than the usual June-July slot, due to the fierce summer heat in the Gulf nation.
 "When the announcement was made for the World Cup to be played in November and December, obviously at that time there was a lot of feedback about the disruption to the different calendars of the leagues,” Al-Khater said. "One thing we learned from the pandemic is that many leagues were able to adapt.”
 And the months without any soccer during the pandemic will put into a new perspective the necessary break in the European seasons in 2022 to accommodate the World Cup. The later tournament gives more breathing space for qualifying to be completed rather than the tournament starting in about 18 months.
 It also should provide a break eventually for players in the summer of 2022 after enduring a long stretch of games from around June this year through rescheduled events, including the Euros, and next domestic season.
 "There was always that advantage that the World Cup is taking place midseason, so players are going to be fresh and it would translate into much better football on the field of play,” Al-Khater said. "We hope that remains the same that they will have a break in the summer (of 2022).”
 Last week marked 10 years since Qatar won the right to host the World Cup in a contentious FIFA vote that sparked corruption investigations into the entire bidding process. FIFA did not find evidence that warranted stripping Qatar of the hosting rights.
 The natural gas-rich emirate has spent tens of billions of dollars to build hotels, a new transport system and lavish stadiums to cope with staging one of the world's biggest sporting events.
 Qatar used the seven-team Club World Cup in December 2019 that was won by Liverpool to test its soccer infrastructure. This year’s edition, featuring Bayern Munich as European champions, has been postponed until February due to the pandemic and it’s unlikely to have an influx of supporters like last year.
 Three of the eight stadiums have been completed and a fourth at Al Rayyan is due to be ready to stage the domestic Amir Cup on Dec. 18, which is Qatar's National Day and when the World Cup final is due to be played in two years.
 "The rest will be completed by the end of the year (2021), beginning of 2022,” Al-Khater said.
 After being awarded the World Cup, the need for mass construction projects across Qatar exposed conditions for a migrant workforce that drew condemnation from rights activists and forced the nation to provide better conditions and clamp down on violations.
 "The World Cup has definitely been a catalyst to looking out into workers rights and standards,” Al-Khater said. "Not everybody is going to agree with what you say, and not everybody is going to change their point of view.”

A man’s Thanksgiving brawl ended up saving his best friend’s life. Kaleb Bentham and his 90-pound pit bull “Buddy” spent Thanksgiving lying in bed, but they’re feeling more thankful than ever. It was a tale of survival, the day before Thanksgiving. Benham said Buddy was outside playing near his home off You Bet Road when something just didn’t sound right. Buddy had come face to face with a 350-pound bear. “I heard a growl, looked about 75-100 feet down, and the bear was dragging him by his head, had his head in his mouth,” Benham said. That horror sunk in but didn’t paralyze him. “I just ran down there, plowed into the bear, tackled it and grabbed it by the throat and started punching the bear in the head and his eye ntil he let the dog go. Then came the desperate dash to find a vet. The first place Benham tried, which was closest to his house, had been closed down due to a positive COVID-19 case. “My first thought was that I was going to lose him,” Benham said. But Mother Lode Veterinary Hospital was ready for surgery as soon as Benham got there. Buddy needed staples, stitches and tubes inserted into his head to drain fluid. 3 1/2 hours of surgery! And now Buddy is making a speedy recovery. But the bear is still out there and Benham said it won’t leave them alone. It’s been back to the house several times since the attack.

Christmas came a little early for families in Kings Mountain Saturday as Santa Claus himself made house calls throughout the town.


   


  Riding atop a float and preceded by a city fire truck dutifully announcing his presence, Jolly Old Saint Nick waved to children as he motored by.


   


  Think of the mini-parade as an adaptation in the age of COVID-19, according to Kings Mountain Special Events Coordinator Angela Padgett.


   


  "If you can't really get out and take in the Christmas parades like you normally would, we wanted to make sure Santa still showed up," Padgett said. "This year, it's been tough for everybody and we've tried to find ways to help families just feel normal."


   


  Caleb Sigmon, admitted this week he's probably not the most likely of choices to don the signature red Santa suit and accompanying beard. The Charlotte- based actor and theatrical company owner is young, only 28-years-old, clean shaven in daily life and might weigh 150-pounds soaking wet, but the role of Kris Kringle is one he said he's grown to love.


   


  For him, it happened almost by accident. He said a friend in Granite Falls was hosting a festival and needed a replacement Santa in a hurry.


   


  "I told him, no, Santa isn't really my thing," Sigmon said Thursday. "But he kept after me and I said, fine, I'll do it for one night."


   


  That night, amid a crush of children asking for the newest gadgets and gear a little boy looked up and asked him for a toothbrush. Sigmon said that was the moment he realized exactly how much some children needed hope for the holidays.


   


  Since then, he said putting on his custom red suit and beard has been a privilege.


   


  "I can't promise to get a kid whatever's on their list," Sigmon said. "But I can love them, pray for them and guarantee for them there's a light at the end of the tunnel. I do believe anything can happen during Christmas and that's a little of what I'm trying to share when I do this."

Could be really interesting if they can get their heat issues under control - and find a way to squeeze one of these chips into a proper 13" chassis.      The Zephyrus 14 was so close, but it was plasticy, very loud and very hot - so didn't quite fit the bill as an ultrabook. Hopefully this year someone will take one of these chips, combine with one of the RTX30 series Max Q that we're expecting, and put it in an aluminium ultrabook chassis.      I will keep dreaming, I don't think it's quite realistic yet…but we'll see!      edit: Didn't think about it at the time, but if AMD released an RDNA2 mobile chipset that could be even better - as much as I am a fan of DXR on desktop, it's much less important on a laptop imo so this could be a huge opportunity.

Istanbul (APP - UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 7th Dec, 2020 ) :Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan believes "a win-win formula" can be found in a row with Greece over undersea resources, according to comments published on Monday, as EU leaders mull sanctions ahead of a summit.


  NATO members Turkey and Greece have been at loggerheads over maritime territory in the eastern Mediterranean, believed to be rich in energy resources including natural gas.


  Turkey has enraged Greece by sending a survey ship and navy vessels to the disputed waters, prompting Athens to push its EU allies for tougher sanctions at Thursday's summit.


  "I am calling on all neighbouring countries in the Mediterranean especially Greece not to see this issue as a zero-sum game," Erdogan said.


  "I believe a win-win formula that observes everyone's rights could be found." Erdogan reiterated a call to gather "all the actors around the table" including the breakaway republic in northern Cyprus, which is recognised only by Turkey.

It feels like the Packers have had special teams struggles for over a decade, and it may not be far from the truth. In 2018, Green Bay was graded as the worst special teams unit by Pro Football Focus. The Packers have since changed coordinators, but the problem has only improved marginally. According to PFF, Green Bay’s special teams is 25th in the league in 2020, and that is without the Philadelphia game taken into consideration. This offseason, LaFleur may need to take a good long look at the third unit to make sure it is up to snuff.

New Delhi: Seeking to boost the capability of the lower judiciary to hear cases online, funds have been released to set up 'video conference cabins' in 2,506 court complexes across India, Law Ministry officials said. While funds to the tune of Rs 5.21 crore were released in September to set up video conference cabins, another Rs 28.886 crore were given in October to buy additional video conference equipment, including hardware, cables and monitors, the officials.      The funds were provided by the e-committee of the Supreme Court and the Department of Justice in the Law Ministry.      While India has 3,288 court complexes, which house thousands of subordinate courts, the funds have been released for 2,506 court complexes to set up video conference cabins.     
 Bigger court complexes with a large number of courtrooms would get multiple cabins as compared to smaller complexes.      The size of a court complex, including the number of courts it houses, depends upon the size or population of the state.      As courts continue to hear cases online amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the government has procured 1,500 additional video conferencing licences at an approximate cost of rupees nine crore for providing the facility for high courts and district courts.      While the procurement has been completed, the process of installation is on, an official said.      Such licences are required for legal and extended use of the video conference facility software, the official said.      From the day the nationwide lockdown was imposed to check the spread of coronavirus in till October 28, high courts and district courts across India have heard over 49.67 lakh cases virtually, according to data collated by the Law Ministry.      The Centre had imposed the lockdown from March 25 to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. From June 8, it started gradually relaxing restrictions under 'Unlock'.

For many years the county was unable to do much for its neediest people. Through much of the 1990s and into today, L.A. County government struggled with federal cutbacks, tax restrictions and budget shortfalls. It briefly flirted with bankruptcy. In the aftermath, the supervisors sometimes acted like Depression babies — survivors of hard times who hid pennies under the mattress and opened their wallets only when compelled. Their parsimony kept the county afloat and the most basic services intact, but limited the board’s ability to do much about growing problems like homelessness.
 Now, as the county creates (on paper) the nation’s most revolutionary social service infrastructure, it’s not always easy to see progress on the ground. Thousands of people formerly living on the street have been housed, only to be replaced by thousands more. The supervisors have alternately supported and undermined their public health leaders on responses to the pandemic. Their fights with Sheriff Alex Villanueva have decreased confidence in their leadership, even if it’s the sheriff’s irresponsible actions and statements at the heart of each dispute.
 The supervisors can seem insular, arrogant and intransigent. They sometimes appear to relish their current ban on public meetings and to have adapted all too well to a limited schedule, with no video presence and greatly reduced opportunity for direct public input. They often conduct public business during closed sessions. The board’s standing and effectiveness suffer as a result.
 There are too few of them to adequately represent their constituents. For a board committed to equity in a county with a Latino population approaching 50%, it is striking that it has never had more than one Latino member — or one Black member, for that matter — or any Asians. A county this size should have at least nine supervisors, with the best number to be determined upon study and a community-driven process.

SC in a closed hearing on January 16 dismissed Airtel, Vodafone Idea and Tata Teleservices' plea that they had filed back in November asking the court for a review of its October AGR ruling. Airtel and VIL have said they are likely to file curative petitions with January 23 due date impending in sight. The rejection to extend any help to carriers could potentially lead to a two player industry, analysts believe. VIL being left in the lurch could be seeing exiting the industry as KM Birla has previously said.
 Tariff revisions are believed to take the sector towards recovery, however, more clarity on where exactly the industry will be headed to will come post January 23 deadline of paying AGR compensation.
 Additionally, ahead of the Union budget coming on February 1, the industry which is being weighed down by multiple taxes and levies has reportedly asked the government for aid in the form of reduction of regulatory levies, taxes and license fees with lower interest rates to access credit. Demands for removal of GST from license fee and spectrum usage charges have also been made.

Many of us have been a part of this market for up to 15 years. At times this market has had more than 50 vendors providing an array of goods and services to this community from local fruit and vegetables to homemade goods, hand-made goods, quality peanuts, hand bags, baskets and in some cases, support products for charity groups, churches and youth groups.


   


  Amish families bring their homemade and hand-made goods, produce and fruit and many more items. Our local Marine Corp group is set up every Saturday supporting all their causes.


   


  Over the years things have changed. Annual rising costs make it difficult for vendors to afford spaces, especially due to BIG Corporate PROMEDICA purchasing most all of the property. They have raised the costs the last two years to the extreme. The Market Manager was told we will not be allowed to set up there any longer. Thank you PROMEDICA for shutting us down with nowhere to go.

We are going to put our heads together and try to find a location within the same proximity with the same visibility, but have no options at this time.

I was second from youngest in my 1965 high school graduating class, just 17 years and about 8 months when we received our diplomas.
   
 This was a time when young men, 18 years and older were subject to be drafted into the military services. Many of my classmates in their zeal to avoid the draft joined the Marines and Air Force. Some joined the Navy.
   
 Two years later with a few hours of college under my belt I joined the Army with the promise of attending the Field Artillery Officers' Candidate School at Fort Sill, Oklahoma.
   
 Joining the Army with me was my friend and fellow college student, Archie Nichols. Archie was one of few Black students at UNC Chapel Hill in the 1960s. We had become friends working together at the Morrison Dormitory canteen.
   
 The military was ahead of the country in integrating black and white servicemen in the 1960s. But not so much in the 1940s when Black men were not expected to be valiant combatants.
   
 In the Navy, young Black men were often assigned to be cooks or laundrymen. They were given no training on combat equipment.
   
 It was after World War II and Korea that Black and white men were expected to serve side-by-side and many Black men distinguished themselves in the military as they do today.
   
 But on Dec. 7, 1941, a Black man named Doris Miller made a name for himself. Perhaps like Johnny Cash's "Boy Named Sue," Doris grew up fighting because of his name.
   
 He was an accomplished boxer in the Navy where he worked as a cook and had laundry duties. When Japanese bombs began to fall on the American fleet in Honolulu at 7:55 a.m. on Dec. 7 there was little demand for kitchen help or laundry services.
   
 Miller, strong and courageous ran to the deck of the USS West Virginia and rushed to his battle station. Finding it destroyed, he sprinted to the quarterdeck and used his hulking frame to help move the injured.
   
 Miller was among the men who carried the ship's mortally wounded captain to safety. He then returned to the battle carrying ammunition and eventually manning a .50 caliber machine gun.
   
 Despite having no weapons training, he blasted away at the Japanese fighters swarming around the ship.
   
 "It wasn't hard," he later remembered. "I just pulled the trigger and she worked fine…I think I got one of those Jap planes. They were diving pretty close to us."
   
 Miller continued operating the gun until ordered to abandon ship. His actions earned him the Navy Cross -- the first ever presented to an African-American seaman.
   
 He was widely hailed as a war hero in the Black press and later toured the country promoting war bonds before being reassigned to the escort carrier Liscome Bay.
   
 Sadly, Miller was among the 646 crewmen killed when that ship was torpedoed and sunk in 1943.
   
 In Vietnam and stateside I served with many men of valor and accomplishment. My life's experience had been impacted by parents whose Christian values pushed them to honor and respect people of all races and economic circumstances.
   
 Early in life I had Black friends. We played baseball together on grassy fields beside noisy cotton mills. I visited them in their homes and they in mine. In summer, my olive skin darkened so much they called me 'cousin' and we laughed and played practical jokes on one another.
   
 It saddens me that race divides our nation and pushes us apart as perhaps we were in the 1940s and before. I believe in my heart my Black friends know I love them. I know they love me.
   
 Valliant men like Doris Miller gave their lives for the freedoms we enjoy today. When you reflect on the meaning of Dec. 7, 1941, think about Seaman Doris Miller and the men and woman who have served our nation -- Black, white, Asian, Latin and everything in between.
   
 It is not the color of our skin that makes us American veterans. It's the colors for which we fight -- red, white and blue. I'm proud of all the men and women who have served and now serve in the military services.
   
 On this memorable day I especially honor the memory of a cook and laundryman who risked his life to save others and fought our enemy with valor and distinction.

 He and Shirley used to attend social groups hosted by the RVS, and when those stopped due to Covid-19 the organisation sorted volunteers to take care of Len's shopping and check-in with regular calls.
 Len has kept busy during the pandemic by redecorating his kitchen and writing a book about his life - as well as spending precious time with Shirley, taking her out for picnics when restrictions eased over the summer.
 He admitted he often feels lonely, especially in the evenings, and struggles with the fact his 'intelligent' wife now can't communicate with him like she used to.
 The RVS is one of the largest volunteering organisations in the country to date, inspiring and enabling over 3 million people to give their time to help others to meet the needs of the day.
 It runs the NHS Volunteer Responder programme with the GoodSAM app, which recruited over 500,000 volunteers during the first lockdown - however it's now encouraging more to sign up for the winter months.
 Catherine Johnstone CBE, the Royal Voluntary Service CEO, told The Sun: 'We are incredibly grateful to The Duchess of Cambridge for kindly supporting the NHS Volunteer Responders programme.
 'Her "check-in-and-chat" call to Len has meant the world to him. It's so important to highlight the power of conversation... you really can make someone's day.'

The roar of V-twin engines reverberated throughout Ranlo Saturday morning as hundreds of motorcyclists kicked off the 25th annual Gaston County Toy Run for Kids.


   


  As a wave of parents and children moved through the parking lot of Ranlo Church of God toward box trucks packed tight with toys, Andrew "Sugarfoot" Jenkins grinned behind his face mask and nodded his head.


   


  "This right here is why we keep this up," Jenkins said. "It's kind of a madhouse out here between all the riders, the kids, their families. You can't look at this though and say it's not all worth it."


   


  Jenkins, an original member of the Southern Gentlemen motorcycle club, helped organize Gaston County's first toy run a quarter century ago. The idea was to host a year-end motorcycle ride and donate a few gifts to kids who might otherwise go without during the Christmas season.


   


  That inaugural event drew less than 100 riders, Jenkins said, but kick started a tradition. On Saturday, riders wearing weather-beaten leather jackets and denim vests rumbled into Ranlo by the hundreds with some from as far away as Tennessee and Georgia.


   


  Jenkins estimated more than 500 riders showed up Saturday morning, a decrease from previous years he chalked up to the pandemic.


   


  "We typically have a group from Ohio who hits this event as part of their vacation, but I think COVID may have kept them at the house this year," Jenkins said.


   


  Diane Etters, who helps choreograph the yearly run, said the 2020 event drew nearly 200 sponsors. Those individuals and businesses helped stuff multiple trucks with toys and goodies which were free to any kids and families who were able to make it to one of the toy runs four stops on Saturday.


   


  She got emotional waving to a toddler who had snagged a tiny toy motorcycle Saturday.


   


  "I've been pitching in here for 18 years now and I'd never miss it," Etters said. "This very well could be Christmas for some of these kiddos, especially this year."

SEN WIN: I think the first question to ask is, where is TRB? This should not have happened if TRB was on the ball monitoring, regulating and making sure the performance of the concessionaire, the operators are up to par. This is a long drawn problem already here in the north. We use the toll road, I use the toll road on a regular basis and I've experienced on and off RFID readers when I use the North Expressway, sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't work and most often than not if it doesn't work you have to drive back and switch to another lane and this is the root cause of the problem, the RFID readers does not work 100% of the time and if doesn't work a lot of cars would back up and move to another lane and just imagine if trucks do that? That's why we're seeing all these pictures of monstrous traffic in the North, it's because of the faulty and non-functioning RFID readers. Now, this should not have happened all along because we have a regulator that monitors all of this and the basic premise here is we gave the operator the chance, the privilege to operate this, thinking that they will do a better job and they will give the Filipino consumers the best service possible and the regulator will monitor it and make sure that they are performing up to par but obviously they are not and we're still experiencing a lot of this monstrous traffic as we speak and the question here is, where is the regulator? How come the regulator is not doing its job in terms of cracking the whip and making sure that the operators are performing up to what is written in the concession agreement? because in the agreement it states there that in exchange for the privilege of operating the toll roads, you have to deliver the best service possible to our consumers.

The body of the missing MiG-29 pilot Commander Nishant Singh was found on Monday, Indian Navy officials said.
 Commander Singh had gone missing on November 26 after his MiG-29K trainer aircraft crashed into the Arabian Sea. Rescue teams were able to rescue the other pilot on board.
 The Russian-origin twin-seat trainer jet went down off India's west coast after taking off from the deck of the country's only aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya.
 The November 26 crash was the fourth accident involving the MiG-29K maritime fighter fleet. India's top auditor had pointed to some deficiencies in the deck-based fighter, including engine troubles, airframe problems, deficiencies in its fly-by-wire system and poor serviceability, in a report tabled in Parliament four years ago.

The first challenge is that the consistently rapid growth of the Philippine population and economy make total electrification a moving target. As our communities grow, the number of households that need to be electrified grows as well. For example, the Department of Energy states that the number of unenergized households nationwide actually grew between 2016 and 2017 from 2.1 million to almost 2.8 million, fell to around 900 thousand in 2018 but once again increased to 1.6 million in 2019. Second is the traditional mindset that electrification should be done through grid extension, which has constricted the pace of electrification due to funding limitations. Just to illustrate, according to the National Electrification Administration, there are 12,672 unelectrified on-grid sitios as of 30 June 2020. For FY 2021, the proposed budget for NEA's sitio electrification program is Php 1.728 billion covering around 1,153 sitios. If the same amount is given by the national government every year, then it would take close to ten years to electrify all these sitios. Meanwhile, the number of these sitios will continue to increase due to population growth. Third, there seems to be a disconnect between the official government definition of 'electrification' and the actual state of electrification at the household and community levels. Many communities considered as 'energized' by the government on paper suffer from unstable and unreliable power supply characterized by frequent rolling brownouts, and there are those in the off-grid areas which, due to power generation limitations, only have 8 to 16 hours of electricity. Since the 17th Congress, the Senate Committee on Energy started to refer to these places as "underserved" areas, or those that do not enjoy 24-hour access to electricity due to various reasons, which should be included in the "total electrification" program of the government.

LONDON, Dec 7 (Reuters) - Prince William and his wife Kate arrived in Edinburgh on Monday at the start of a nationwide train tour of Britain to meet and thank frontline workers, care home staff and teachers for their efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic.
 William, Queen Elizabeth's grandson and second-in-line to the throne, and Kate are travelling 1,250 miles across England, Scotland and Wales on board the Royal Train as part of their three-day trip.
 They kicked off the tour at London's Euston Station on Sunday evening where they were serenaded by Welsh pop star Shakin' Stevens singing his 1980s hit "Merry Christmas Everyone" before leaving for Scotland.
 "Thank you to all transport workers everywhere for keeping the country moving throughout this difficult year," they wrote on a train information board before they set off.
 Britain has been the hardest hit country in Europe by COVID-19, with more than 60,000 deaths.
 "The Duke and Duchess are very much looking forward to shining a spotlight on the incredible work that has been done across the country throughout this difficult year," Kensington Palace said in a statement.
 Queen Victoria was the first reigning monarch to use the Royal Train in 1842, to travel from Slough to London's Paddington station, although critics have questioned its purpose in recent years, saying it is expensive and little used. (Reporting by Michael Holden; editing by Sarah Young)

“I like to use that run in as kind of a way to get the blood going, get my blood pumping a little bit and it just kind of helps me on that jog in,” Patton told The Japan Times.
 “I use that time to focus on what I’m about to do and get a little more mentally prepared.” What Patton often did after his mid-game runs this year was strike people out. He fanned 65 in 53 innings in 2020, the most in the Central League and second only to the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks’ Livan Moinelo among NPB relievers.
 Patton made 56 appearances out of the bullpen for DeNA in 2020, finishing with 19 holds — tied for seventh in the CL — and a 3.83 ERA. He was one of five CL relievers with a strikeout rate over 11. From Aug. 27 to Oct. 13, he went on a run of 19 straight scoreless relief appearances.
 Patton had a solid year under strange circumstances as COVID-19 forced NPB players and teams to deal with a lot as they tried to complete a season amid a pandemic.
 Now as a free agent, Patton is searching for his next mound in a market that may also be affected by the coronavirus fallout. Playing fewer games in front of reduced crowds (in Japan) or none at all (in MLB) caused a sharp decline in revenues for teams in 2020.
 “I think it plays a factor for a lot of players this year,” Patton said. “I mean look at what’s going on in the States. That atmosphere is kind of crazy right now. Nobody knows if they’re going to have a shortened season next year.
 For many free agents, the virus fallout raises a lot of questions.
 “So it’s like, do you sign with a team, because you may not get the money that you signed for if they have a prorated season again,” Patton said. “Are you going to have a season at all? “So guys are going to have to make some sacrifices. Teams are going to have to make some sacrifices. It definitely concerns me a little bit. But I just want to play. For me, that’s the main thing.” Patton is a ballplayer, and that’s the only certainty in these uncertain times.
 “I just want an opportunity to continue my career and play,” he said. “I don’t want all that money talk and all that stuff to hinder me from getting a job. I just want to be on the field.” After four solid years in Yokohama, Patton is reportedly receiving interest from some MLB clubs, including the Texas Rangers, for whom he played in 2014 and 2015. He’s also open to returning to Japan, saying his family enjoyed their time in Yokohama.
 “I think we’re looking for the best fit,” Patton said. “We’re not going to shut the door on anything. We welcome any opportunity, whether it be Japan or back here in the States. We’re gonna weigh our options and we’re gonna to find out what’s best suited for our family. I’m open to coming back to Japan, I’m not going to shut the door on that.
 “We would love to come back if we had an opportunity to do so. But also, who doesn’t wanna play in the big leagues? So if there’s that opportunity too, I’m open to that as well.” Patton’s 101 holds in Japan makes him one of four foreign pitchers with at least 100 in NPB history, and he’s 32nd on the career list. He’s racked up 243 strikeouts in 205⅔ innings.
 He’s gained experience in Japan and isn’t the same pitcher who arrived in 2017.
 “I’ve gotten more confident at being able to throw the ball inside more,” Patton said. “I know that’s something I was missing before I came to Japan. I was able to develop that part of my game, being able to establish the inside part of the plate and continue to throw the ball there.
 “Then also I learned I needed a third pitch. So this past year, I started throwing my changeup a lot more and I actually was pretty successful with it for the most part, throwing it and gained a lot more confidence in that. So establishing the third pitch and the confidence with that third pitch is something that I definitely improved on.” Because of the virus, Patton’s most recent NPB season was certainly the strangest.
 “I was very skeptical that we were going to get the entire season in,” Patton said. “When they told us we were going to play 120 games (out of 143), I was like, ‘Oh, my gosh, there’s no way.’ “Then once we got underway and once we got through the frustrations of having to do all the little things like temperature checks everyday and social distancing while we eat, not being able to go out to eat on the road and wearing the mask all the time. I think once we got through all of that everybody got comfortable and it was good.
 “I think we managed it great, especially the BayStars.”
 Patton was pleased with how he performed in 2020, especially after missing time last year following an incident where he landed three punches on the dugout refrigerator after a frustrating outing against the Yomiuri Giants in August.
 "I was happy with how I felt after my incident last year," he said. "My boneheaded incident in the dugout and missing the last part of the season. I felt like I had to come back and prove myself again. And I think that I started off that way.
 "I had a really good start to the season. The first part of the season, I pitched really well there. And then I hit a couple of bumps.
 "After that, out of the bullpen-wise, after those couple of hiccups I felt like I threw the ball really well. And that was my goal, to have a long stretch of really good bullpen outings and just show that I can still pitch."

While a number of actors have started shooting for various projects, everyone has had a challenging time handling Covid guidelines while on set. With standard operating procedures involving constant sanitization, PPE kits, masks on most of the time and what not, Kirti Kulhari, too, has been shooting maintaining all safety precautions.
 "I was super excited. I understand the Covid-19 situation. I also understand that getting back to normal life, with the precautions in place, is the way to go forward. We can't be sitting at home and not doing anything. It happened for a while and a long time during the lockdown. No one thought that three- four months would just pass by and we would still be at home. I am all for looking ahead and moving forward," says the Uri actor.


 She is starting a few projects this month and has releases lined up in the coming months as well. Kulhari reveals that some projects got pushed because of Covid, including her web show Four More Shots Please! season 3.
 Talking about her experience of shooting initially, she shares, "Usually a 12-hour shift doesn't mean much as it is a regular thing. But, what happened on the first day of shoot which was that after five-six hours of shooting, I felt so tired as if I had shot for 24 hours. Everyone had gotten used to not working for months so being back on the set, it felt longer and tiring. It got me two days to feel and remember that I used to do this on a daily basis. I asked other co-actors who had shot more than me about feeling tired and they said that they too went through this in the first few days. I was glad to know that I was not the only one. There will be back-to-back shoots which I am looking forward to."
