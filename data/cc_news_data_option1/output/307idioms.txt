Chicago is widely known as the "windy city" but the California city of Palm Springs has been benefiting from its Santa Ana winds since 1982, when the first wind farm was built in the San Gorgonio Pass.      Coming from Los Angeles, travelers will find thousands of turbines -- about 4,000 -- on both sides of Interstate 10. Driving by, the energy producing "windmills" look big, but travelers can't really get a handle on how big until standing next to one. Some of the blades are more than half the size of a football field, standing about 150 feet tall. At the top, the turbines have a generator that weighs in at 30,000 to 45,000 pounds.      The wind farm provides enough energy to power Palm Springs and the entire Coachella Valley. It is quite a sight, and to get an understanding of how it all works, take a wind farm tour. Best of the Best Tours offers tours with knowledgeable guides -- a lot more fun than science class. For information and to purchase tickets visit thebestofthebesttours.com.      Palm Springs is also known for its movie history. Many famous people lived in this valley, including Bob Hope, Frank Sinatra, Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball, Jack Benny, Bing Crosby, Tony Curtis, Sandra Dee, Gene Autry, Cary Grant, Elvis and so many more. It was where they escaped to enjoy privacy and relaxation. Today's stars who can be seen in the area include Leonardo DiCaprio, Suzanne Somers, Barbra Streisand and James Brolin, Robert Downey Jr., Brad Pitt and President Obama and family.      History walking tours are offered through the Palm Springs Historical Society for those interested in the homes of the stars and architecture. Visit pshistoricalsociety.org. Best of the Best Tours also offers a Rich and Famous Tour that includes homes to the stars.      This valley of 48,000-plus residents offers a large variety of entertainment, from theaters, concerts and plays to horseback riding and snowshoeing. Yes, this warm, sunny, palm-tree-lined city offers winter sports. Take a short tram ride up the mountain -- 8,516 feet -- to Mount San Jacinto State Park, where residents and visitors take part in winter sports and camping, hiking and guided nature walks in the summer. The Palm Springs Aerial Tramway takes riders high above the valley to the snow-capped mountains. At the top of the mountain, visitors will find Peaks Restaurant. It offers beautiful views of the Coachella Valley and good food. Also at the top is Pines Cafe, a cafeteria-style restaurant, and the Lookout Lounge, offering alcoholic beverages and appetizers.      The tram itself is an experience. It rotates as travelers ascend and descend the mountain to take in all the views of the valley and the mountains. The first tram was completed in 1963, but a project was completed in 2000 that added new cars and renovated the facilities. It is known as the world's largest rotating tramcar system ever constructed. Visit pstramway.com for details on the tram rides, dining and activities.

Coulson Aviation of Oregon said in a statement that one of its C-130 Lockheed large air tankers was lost after it left Richmond in New South Wales with three aboard, carrying retardant for a firefighting mission. It said the accident was “extensive” but had few other details.
 Coulson grounded other firefighting aircraft as a precaution pending investigation, reducing planes available to firefighters in New South Wales and neighboring Victoria state. The four-propeller Hercules drops more than 4,000 gallons of fire retardant in a single pass.
 Spokeswoman Robyn Baldwin of Coulson, with headquarters in the Canadian province of British Columbia and extensive U.S. operations, declined to identify the crew members or say what U.S. states they were from.
 “We ask for privacy at this time as we mourn the loss of our crew members,” Baldwin said.
 On Friday morning in Australia, what was supposed to be a gracious farewell for some American and Canadian firefighting crews instead became a more somber occasion punctuated with a moment of silence for those killed.
 In New South Wales, Australians, Canadians and Americans joined together in a one-minute moment of silence as a mark of respect for the three crew members.
 New South Wales police said the Americans were 42, 43 and 45 years old, but did not name them. It will be up to the victims’ families to decide whether and when Australian officials may identify the crew members, police said.
 The crew members were flying a C-130 Hercules aerial water tanker over the Monaro region of the Snowy Mountains when authorities lost contact with the aircraft and crews on the ground reported a possible crash and fireball. It crashed in rugged terrain that was difficult to reach.

"Our industry is definitely evolving," Devaney said. Consumers "are eating more on the go and more in restaurants and not as much at home with a gallon jug at the kitchen table. Dairy companies are taking that into consideration with more single-serve milk, cheese and yogurt products to appeal to what works best for consumers."
 The negative market pressures continue to force out small dairies in the state, as milk prices had fallen below the cost of production, she said. Unlike wheat and corn that is sold by the bushel, milk is sold by the 100-pound unit.
 The price for 100 pounds of milk had fallen to about $14 between 2016 and 2018 largely because of increased global supplies, said Ken Bailey, the leader of economic planning and analysis for Seattle-based Darigold Inc.
 "Canada and the (European Union) had (dairy production) growth rates well ahead of ours," Bailey said. "That supply put downward pressure on prices. It's been tough for farmers."
 As a result of the low prices, many small farmers pulled the plug, Devaney said. In 2014, Washington had about 600 dairies. Now, only about 350 continue to operate.
 "Like any business owner, when you are consistently losing money for that long, it's really hard to stay in business," she said.
 The average age of farmers in the state is almost retirement age for other careers, Devaney said.
 "Several farmers don't have the next generation that is interested in coming back," she said, or the farmers "don't have anybody to leave them to."
 While the number of dairies has continued to decline, the number of milk cows has increased at the larger operations. In 2008, Washington had about 244,000 milk cows. As of 2018, it had about 277,000.
 "So that number has grown as the number of farmers has fallen," Devaney said.
 Case VanderMeulen, 54, owner of Coulee Flats Dairy in Mesa, said his 7,000-cow operation has struggled with the low milk prices. But, at the same time, he benefited because he paid lower prices for the 100 pounds of feed he gives each cow daily.
 The lower commodity prices "lessens the blow a little bit," VanderMeulen said. "But higher prices usually works better because your margin is better. It's just a lot better when the dairy economy is booming.
 "We have to go through the ups and downs," he continued. "The downs suck, and the ups are never long enough."
 Prices for milk started to rebound in the last few months of 2019, he said. "And the 2020 outlook is pretty decent," he said.
 Bailey, the Darigold executive, said new trade deals with Canada, Mexico and China can only help the dairy markets.
 "Of course, we are thrilled about this," Bailey said. "It lays out a very clear foundation for how trade is going to take place. China is likely going to be buying a whole lot more agricultural products from the U.S. and buying less from the EU and Australia."
 Changing consumer preferences have had a profound effect on national markets. For example, the amount of liquid milk consumed per capita in the U.S. has tumbled more than 40% since 1975. Americans drank about 24 gallons a year in 1996, according to government data. That dropped to 17 gallons in 2018.
 In November, Dean Foods, the nation's largest milk producer filed for bankruptcy and it was quickly followed by Borden Dairy Co. The dairies companies, both based in Dallas, controlled about 13.5% of U.S. sales last year.
 But Bailey said sales for Darigold, which has a processing plant in Spokane, remain strong. He credited the cooperative's access to export markets and new products like the drink Fit milk. Producers use filters to increase the protein level and reduce the natural lactose-based sugars. The new product also has the added benefit of a longer shelf life than liquid milk.
 "Fit milk is an example of what consumers want and how we are adjusting to fit those needs," he said. "So, the demand is there."

TEL AVIV (JTA) — “Where’s the Chagall?” asked a visitor to this city’s Gordon Gallery on a January morning in 1996, hoping to glimpse one of the prize lots being auctioned days later by the gallery.
 The painting, titled “Jacob’s Ladder,” was prominently on display, but still a gallery employee walked the prospective buyer over. When they arrived at the work’s designated spot on the wall, all that remained was a bent nail. The Chagall was gone.
 For nearly two decades, the painting remained missing. Now it’s on public view for the first time in 24 years, again as part of a pre-auction exhibition, this time at the Tiroche Auction House in Herzliya. The small, biblically themed canvas that will be offered for sale this week as Lot 99 is notably installed in a glass case in Tiroche’s showroom north of Tel Aviv, one of hundreds of works that are part of the auction house’s Israeli and International Art Sale.

FOREST PARK—A proposed ordinance that would allow some Forest Park city employees to carry firearms on city property but not in city vehicles went back to the drawing board after an extended debate at the Jan. 22 City Council meeting. The proposed ordinance follows a July 2, 2019 incident in which a Public Works employee bought a pistol on his lunch break and showed it to coworkers. The city has no policy on firearms in the workplace.
 Councilwoman Latresa Akins-Wells opposed the measure. "To me, it's stating that 'what you did was okay. And now we’re going to allow everyone to do what you did.’ So I’m 100 percent against this. I’m not for it. Especially with the workplace shootings that’s going on today. That’s the last thing we need.”
 Williams said the city has limited options for regulating firearms. "I know there are differences on all sides of this but, for better or worse, Georgia through the legislature is a very gun-friendly state. And they have preempted a number of local laws with respect to the regulation of guns. But one thing that they have given specific authority to cities and counties to do is to regulate the possession of weapons by employees, with the exception of the police department."

The estimate doesn’t reflect the increase in value of Chagall works over the past two decades. Though sale prices vary according to the period of an artist’s career, subject matter and ownership history, among other variables, Chagall’s “Les Amoureux” sold at Sotheby’s in New York in 2017 for $28.45 million — a record for the artist.
 “If we were to follow absolute values, then Chagall’s prices have almost doubled over the past 20 years,” Tiroche said. “We want the opening price here to be relatively attractive to buyers in Israel and overseas because if the estimate is too high, people may decide not to bid. And also the insurance company wants to finish the saga of the money they paid out over 20 years ago.”
 The opening bid at the auction, taking place this Saturday evening, has been set at $110,000.
 Prospective bidders will have to figure out the provenance of “Jacob’s Ladder” for themselves. Though the general practice is to publicize the full provenance of art offered for sale, in part to prevent stolen works from circulating on the open market, the Tiroche catalog does not contain such information for the Chagall — information Tiroche described as “gossip- oriented” and unsuitable for inclusion in the catalog.
 Besides, Tiroche said, everyone knows the story anyway. His principal concern is just ensuring the painting stays in the showroom long enough to make it to the auction block.
 “The painting isn’t big, but now it’s also in a heavy, big frame,” Tiroche said. “This place is secured. Touch wood, in 27 years we haven’t had a single incident of theft or anything like that. Everything should be OK.”

That's right. As I said, the initial -- the initial project was to not build new tank houses for this project but to use what we had available at Safford.

So it's not going to go to Miami or any of that. We're going to use as much as we can effectively of the existing facilities at Safford. The next step will be, say, do we do some incremental investment in new facilities to take advantage of the resource and then ultimately, and this is down the road, if we get to that sulfide then that could be a very major project for us because as I said, it'll potentially be a new Morenci.

“The one-on-one times I have with students are so special and I’m hoping that I’m moving the needle a little bit,” said Schmidt.
 Few appreciate her efforts in the moment. That’s why one experience a few years ago at the Final Four in Texas is so memorable.
 “This young man comes running up to me. ‘Dean Schmidt. Dean Schmidt! You suspended me last year. It was the best thing that ever happened to me. Thank you so much.’ It was very genuine and completely out of the blue. And it was a really heartwarming experience,” she said.
 Among her responsibilities, Schmidt addresses many sexual assault cases. She said thoughtfully, “I would not have picked it for myself. But I am a very God-fearing woman and I know that I’m not in charge of where I go. My skillset fits this. Colleagues and mentors encouraged me to go into something I was afraid of. Who wants to investigate something that isn’t clear cut?”
 Another “very important piece” of her life also arose unexpected. Before moving to Waunakee, Tonya and Todd had just spent two years helping to plant a Christian, non-denominational church in Milton. The summer before moving here, Schmidt introduced herself to a woman at Waunafest who was wearing a North Ridge Church shirt. As it turned out, the church was still in its planning stages and had yet to hold a service.
 Schmidt related, “When we were sent off by our church family in Milton, we were welcomed by our new church family here.” These days, Todd plays drums in the North Ridge worship band and Tonya works in the kid’s church area and leads a youth group of 7th and 8th grade girls.
 It was with an appreciative smile that Schmidt added, “We didn’t expect to plant another church. God had some other plans for us.”

Mrs Lawford sat with a bowed head in the dock at Birmingham Magistrates' Court on Thursday, for what district judge Joanna Dickens called "a very strange case".
 The owners of the five missing dogs sat behind Mrs Lawford in the public gallery, listening intently.
 The 48-year-old, who owns a rescue Labrador, pleaded guilty to boarding more than the maximum number of three small dogs allowed at her kennels in June last year.
 She also admitted boarding dogs from different households without written consent from owners, and without ensuring dogs were vaccinated, flea-treated and wormed.
 Mrs Lawford further pleaded guilty to failing to seek veterinary treatment for a West Highland Terrier, named Charlie, after he developed a skin infection while under her care.
 Defence lawyer Tom Walkling said Mrs Lawford suffered a nervous breakdown after her marriage failed.

I just bought a 93 LX today (first mustang) and I am in dire need of a good supplier of quality replacement parts. If anyone has suggestions for a website or a brand name I should look into I would really appreciate it. I do want quality replacements at a fair price I would like to stay away from the cheap Chinese remakes if possible. I will be needing several different things over the course of completing this build but at the moment I am needing the following. Headlights, weather striping, "rocker covers"? (grey plastic trim inside the car above the rocker), sun roof "seal"?, 5 lug conversion, cobra R's (possibly a used set with tires), center console lid, wiper motor cover/hood cowling, and a few other odds and ends. If anyone has any idea where I can get a quality OEM used replacement for some of these items or point me to a supplier that sells quality aftermarket stuff that would be GREAT! I am not new to cars but this is my first mustang EVER so any information would be greatly appreciated! Thank you in advance for any advice/information that anyone has to offer! I am looking forward to my time here and building this fox body! Thanks again! P.S. I own a fully equipped shop in the middle Georgia area if I can assist anyone in that regard I have lifts and open bays all the time just let me know!

SAN DIEGO COUNTY, Calif. — San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer and the San Diego Association of Governments signed an exclusive agreement Wednesday with acting Secretary of the Navy Thomas Modly to take the next step in redeveloping Naval Base Point Loma Old Town Campus into a massive transit hub.      Wednesday's signing means that the Navy is committed to the project -- something that wasn't necessarily a given. The previous Secretary of the Navy, Richard Spencer, was ousted two months after signing an initial memorandum of understanding in 2019.      Faulconer said the agreement showed the strength of the plan.      "This new agreement is built on San Diego's strong naval heritage," he said. "The fact that it was signed by the Acting Secretary of the Navy inside the Pentagon sends the undeniable message that there is momentum and energy in both Washington, D.C. and San Diego to do something truly special with this property. It marks a huge next step in revitalizing this area into a civic asset that serves the U.S. Navy, the community and our regional transportation network."      The Navy and SANDAG have previously discussed what a development at the site -- commonly known as NAVWAR -- would look like. A central terminus for buses and trains would be the keystone, but a people-mover or shuttle to the airport would also likely be part of the plan.      The 70.5-acre property Interstate 5-adjacent property is just blocks from the Old Town Transit Center, a centrally located spot which would connect San Diego International Airport with the rest of the county's transit infrastructure. In exchange for redeveloping a portion of the land into a transit hub, the county will build new facilities to house the thousands of Naval cybersecurity experts and contractors -- including the Naval Information Warfare Systems Command -- currently on site.      "The return of great power competition demands that we invest in cutting edge cyber capabilities to stay ahead, and San Diego provides the right access to talent and technology to accelerate the adoption of new concepts," Modly said. "This project will help defend our nation and fuel the partnership and investment that has always made San Diego a great Navy community."      NAVWAR consists largely of outdated World War Two-era airplane hangars. The Navy and SANDAG signed a memorandum of understanding in September 2019 to discuss and collaboratively draft a development plan. SANDAG's board then approved $50 million in initial site-planning funds to be spent over the next five years.      "This agreement gives SANDAG the opportunity to work exclusively with the Navy to potentially develop a central mobility hub that would provide critical transit to the airport and connect all modes of regional transit," said SANDAG Executive Director Hasan Ikhrata. "A collaboration of this magnitude could solidify the Navy's future - and their strategically critical cybersecurity mission - in San Diego for generations to come."      The project might receive partial funding from the San Diego County Regional Airport Authority, which signed a 10-year agreement with its airline partners in 2019 to fund improvements to public transportation to and from the airport.      The project still has a long road ahead of it, and would need extensive environmental reviews, as well as city, state and federal approval. Total cost is estimated between $3.8 and $4.7 billion.

Everything changes when a student-athlete enters into their senior season.
 The idea of it being the end provides the motivation for the players to go out and produce their best season yet.
 Elissa Velasquez of Dolores Huerta Preparatory High School has taken that to heart and is trying to lead the Scorpions into a strong finish and make some noise come postseason time.
 "I feel like our team is working a lot together," Velasquez said. "We've been playing together since our freshman year, all of us together. So this season has been really, really good."
 Coming into the season, coach Brett Marquez knew he needed to find ways to help get the 5-foot-9 Velasquez more open looks down in the paint.
 With some fellow seniors stepping up, Marquez has seen the offense as a whole flow better, and it's given the opportunity for Velasquez to be the team's leading scorer and rebounder with 9.8 and 9.9 per game.
 "I think the biggest help has been that (Velasquez) has some help down low with (senior Pam Salais-Catarino)," Marquez said. "(Velasquez) has always been double-teamed and had to fight through that, but now they have to be accountable for Pam, so she's getting some open looks that she typically wouldn't.
 "And she's getting smarter about clearing some space under the basket to put up and get some rebounds too."
 Playing smarter doesn't mean playing softer though as Velasquez knew that if she wanted to thrive in the post, she would have to change her mentality a bit.
 And get a better grip on the ball as well.
 "More aggressive on offense and defense and better ball handling," Velasquez said on what she wanted to improve coming into the season. "I've always been more of a post player so (I needed to improve in those areas.)"
 But what matters the most is the bright young woman Marquez believes Velasquez has become.
 Marquez described Velasquez as the "epitome" of a scholar-athlete and knows that he can trust Velasquez with pretty much anything.
 Even his own job.
 "I could trust her to run practice if I wasn't there for some reason," Marquez said. "As a matter of fact, I told her (Jan. 16) to make sure when (we practice next) that we touch on these things. I can count on her in that role.
 "She's an outstanding, all-around person."
 The Scorpions will be back in action at 7 p.m. Friday when they travel to take on Class 2A's No. 10-ranked team in the Colorado Springs School.

“I stand before you, grateful for this miracle of reconciliation, and I wish I could say that our remembrance has made us immune to evil,” Steinmeier said. “Yes, we Germans remember. But sometimes it seems as though we understand the past better than the present. The spirits of evil are emerging in a new guise, presenting their anti-Semitic, racist, authoritarian thinking as an answer for the future, a new solution to the problems of our age.
 “I wish I could say that we Germans have learned from history once and for all. But I cannot say that when hatred is spreading.”
 Addressing the gathered world leaders, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed gratitude for the Allied war to defeat Nazi Germany, even as he claimed the world had “largely” abandoned the Jews during the Holocaust. Noting that the lesson of Auschwitz was “always to take seriously the threats of those who seek our destruction,” Netanyahu pointed to a current political concern he believes the world is failing to address.
 “I am concerned that we have yet to see a unified and resolute stance against the most anti-Semitic regime on the planet – a regime that openly seeks to develop nuclear weapons and annihilate the one and only Jewish state,” Netanyahu said, referencing Iran.
 Netanyahu has railed for years against the efforts by the United States and other leading global powers to strike a deal with Iran over its nuclear weapons program. In 2018, President Donald Trump pulled the U.S. out of the nuclear agreement signed three years earlier.
 “Israel salutes President Trump and Vice President Pence for confronting the tyrants of Tehran that subjugate their own people, and threaten the peace and security of the entire world,” Netanyahu said. “They threaten the peace and security of everyone in the Middle East and everyone beyond. I call on all governments to join the vital effort of confronting Iran.”

My daughter was home for Christmas and, one evening at dinner, she asked me what I thought the world would be like in 2020 when I was young. I had to admit I didn't really spend time visualizing the future. I am a cup-half-empty kind of person, and I lived in a mid-century milieu that "was what it was." Many things about it have changed in the time since, but not all.  
 Prices have gone up, never down, sometimes gradually and sometimes like rockets. Women and minorities are gaining ground in decision-making and money- making, but older white guys are still on top. Technology has advanced spottily; pixels are marvelous, except in a rainstorm. Social media are turning out to be antisocial. What do all these "advances into the future" have in common? Human nature, to my eye; greed; the desire for dominance; and a tendency to be mean and nasty incognito.  
 I didn't realize how far my reality was from the reality of others, or how different from other times. I was told once in a class that, in terms of climate and other factors, mid-century was a statistical "outlier." I gauged a lot of my perceptions, as they evolved, on what I learned in school.  
 A few events did break into the flow of days. I remember every second of November 22, 1963, from the moment I emerged from a class and heard what had happened. My thought was, "This doesn't happen in this day and age!" Well, yes, it does.  
 I remember July 20, 1969, very clearly. I have learned and continue to learn what a delicate and miraculous dance of little pieces all together, actions taken on a precise timeline, and heart-stopping courage that was.  
 I remember September 11, 2001, at the WTC. WTH? But these events are not the Jetsons' future, with flying cars and household robots. They are more of the same in the parade of human greed, dominance, and nastiness. Apollo 11 was followed by Challenger, after all.

Slide 6, we address returning again to talking about our strategy and the impacts of that, as I've said often, we are laser focused on execution of this strategy and that's what we are all about. We've worked for years now in planning and developing, particularly at Grasberg, the transition to the underground and now we are executing this very efficiently as you can see by the numbers we reported today. We will have a growing production and cash flow profile that's going to be very significant and it will benefit our shareholders in years to come. We're well advanced on this underground transition, results to date are on target. We're moving closer to 2021 when we'll start seeing the results of this work that we've been doing over the past 15-plus years and then beyond that, how we will be able to benefit from these investments in this work that we're doing. Through the execution of the ramp up at Grasberg, the commissioning of the Lone Star project, ongoing productivities in our Americas operations, we expect to increase our copper and gold sales volumes by over 30% in 2021 compared with the just completed 2019. Throughout the year, this resulted in a 25% reduction in net unit cost, all things being equal and more than double our EBITDA and cash flows at current commodity prices. I personally believe there is a potential for higher prices. With a growing production profile at a time when copper markets may be rising, our shareholders would have exposure to a positive long term future and Freeport will be particularly well situated as it faces that future. Much of the capital investment we need to achieve this result has already been made and achievement of our targets continue to reduce the risk that this plan had embedded in it. These are long-lived assets with a strong base for solid cash flows for the future.
