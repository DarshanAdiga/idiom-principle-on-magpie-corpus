As for showing more of his personal life on the show moving forward, Jason says he's perfectly happy blending into the background ("I have the best gig!"). While he would like _Selling Sunset_ to explore his and Brett's history as lawyers on the show, he's fine with avoiding the drama (save for the whole bachelor party ordeal that sent Mary into a tailspin over trusting Romain, which Jason actually pins on Brett). There is one thing he wants to capture on camera in season 4, though: proving that the Oppenheim Group- branded wine isn’t as bad as the cast makes it out to be!

Daniel Prude began acting out at his brother's house, going under furniture, jumping down stairs head-first and accusing his relatives of wanting to kill him. He was taken to a hospital that evening for a mental health evaluation, though he was released a few hours later, according to police reports and body camera videos.
 He seemed fine when he got back but then suddenly bolted from his brother's house.
 "I don't know if he was playing with me the whole time," Joe Prude told an officer who responded to his call. He worried his younger brother was under the influence of PCP and might hurt himself.
 Joe Prude said his brother left the house wearing no shoes and no coat, just a tank top and long johns on a cold night. Police found him naked just after 3 a.m. on a commercial street blocks from his brother's house.

INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — After climbing up scaffolding to 29 feet above the sidewalk, John Klinkose pulled handfuls of rust out of the inside of the iconic Ayres clock and put it into a bucket. “There’s really a lot of work to be done,” he said. Repairs on Indianapolis’s beloved Ayres Clock began Aug. 21 as crews constructed scaffolding at the southwest corner of Washington and Meridian streets. The scaffolding allows local craftsmen Klinkose and Brose Partington to reach the 8-foot-tall, 10,000-pound clock mounted onto the walls as it undergoes repairs to restore its luster. Klinkose, an artist conservator working on the clock, said the bottom of the clock had built-up debris, including cigarette butts and french fry containers he suspects were left by electricians. The debris blocks the drain holes at the bottom of the clock’s casing, causing water to build up and damage the metal. While the bronze encasing the clock has turned a bit green over time, Klinkose said it just needs a good scrub. The tough part will be the water damage and rust on the steel armature or frame inside the clock. “The armature is the bones. The bronze is the skin,” said project manager Paul Smith. “If there’s damage to the bones, that’s something that’s trickier to fix.” Smith said the bottom of the armature had rusted quite a bit and would need to be replaced. Klinkose is now cleaning the clock, scrubbing off rust with his hands. The next step will be cleaning with soap and water and maybe using sandblasters after that. The crew plans to replace the armature with stainless steel so that it won’t rust as easily. They also plan to hot wax and buff up the clock. Klinkose is taking a look at the patina, the green or brown film on the surface of the bronze. At some point,...

According to Commissioner Reynders, there are three areas for improvement regarding the SCCs: (1) the SCCs must be updated in light of the new requirements introduced by the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), including the requirements of Article 28 and the transparency requirements; (2) the new SCCs should address transfer scenarios that are not covered by the current SCCs, such as transfers of data between an EU data processor and a non-EU data processor; and (3) the new SCCs should better reflect the realities of data processing operations in a modern and open economy. For example, the Commission is exploring solutions to easily enable multiple parties to sign SCCs and allow the accession of new parties.

POLITICA E COVID   VENEZIA C'era da aspettarselo che il Covid e le misure di prevenzione avrebbero fatto danni oltre che all'economia del Paese e delle famiglie, anche alla campagna elettorale. E poiché il coronavirus non guarda in faccia nessuno, è passato anche tra i politici di ogni livello dopo l'ex premier Silvio Berlusconi. Ieri il candidato del centrosinistra, antagonista di Zaia in Regione Arturo Lorenzoni ha dichiarato di essere positivo al Covid.   Subito dopo, Pier Paolo Baretta, candidato sindaco a Venezia per la coalizione di centrosinistra, che aveva avuto un fugace incontro con Lorenzoni domenica mattina (con mascherina e distanziamento e all'aperto) ha annunciato di essersi sottoposto a tampone per precauzione e di autospendersi temporaneamente dalle attività elettorali.   AUTOISOLAMENTO   « Ho appreso che il candidato Presidente alla Regione Veneto Arturo Lorenzoni è risultato positivo al tampone Covid-19. Ho incontrato Arturo domenica scorsa per un'iniziativa di campagna elettorale - ha raccontato Baretta - Io sto bene e non ho sintomi. Come richiesto dalla normativa vigente, ho comunicato all'autorità sanitaria il contatto avuto. Mi sono sottoposto al tampone - di cui attendo i risultati - e nel frattempo per rispetto di tutti i veneziani che incontro quotidianamente mi sono posto in autoisolamento».   La campagna elettorale però non si ferma. Il tampone è risultato negativo e ora Baretta è in attesa di indicazioni su quando potrà tornare ad uscire.   TAMPONE NEGATIVO   «L'esito è stato negativo, ora attendo le indicazioni delle autorità competenti. Tutta la coalizione - ha continuato - i volontari e i cittadini che pensano che un'alternativa per Venezia sia possibile saranno in prima linea ogni giorno in tutti i quartieri della città. A loro dico: la nostra campagna continua sulle vostre gambe. Nei prossimi giorni io continuerò ad essere presente con tutti i mezzi utilizzabili, sui media e sui social, e a presentare proposte e idee per la Venezia del futuro».   IMPEGNI ANNULLATI   Tutti gli impegni di ieri sono stati ovviamente annullati, tra cui la cena di sottoscrizione programmata all'hotel Bologna con il ministro delle Infrastrutture e Trasporti, Paola De Micheli.   Spostato a data da definirsi anche l'incontro previsto questa mattina all'Officina del gusto a Mestre sulla Città metropolitana e le riforme. All'incontro dovevano partecipare i senatori Pd Alessandro Alfieri (capogruppo in commissione Affari esteri) e Andrea Ferrazzi (capogruppo in commissione Ambiente e territorio) oltre a Marisa Gruarin, la candidata del Pd per la Municipalità di Mestre e alla consigliera regionale uscente e candidata dem Francesca Zottis.   Anche lei si è possa spontaneamente in autoisolamento a causa degli incontri con Lorenzoni. Anche nel suo caso, comunque, il tampone è risultato negativo.   M.F.   © RIPRODUZIONE RISERVATA

VOTO IN FIERA   PORDENONE Da Prefettura e ministero dell'Interno è arrivato il via libera definitivo: gli elettori del Comune di Pordenone potranno votare nei seggi elettorali che saranno allestiti all'interno dei padiglioni fieristici di viale Treviso. Lo spostamento consentirà così alle scuole della città di poter continuare nella loro attività didattica che sarà appena cominciata. Il progetto dell'operazione trasloco ha avuto il semaforo verde dopo che sia la commissione prefettizia locale sia gli uffici romani del Viminale hanno dato il semaforo verde. Tutti i rigorosi criteri e le richieste - sia rispetto alle precauzioni e alle misure sanitarie anti-Covid sia sul fronte del diritto e della segretezza del voto - sono state rispettate. La quasi totalità dei seggi elettorali pordenonesi - 48 su 51 - troveranno posto nei locali del quartiere fieristico che saranno adeguati e allestiti in modo da ospitare le sezioni elettorali e le forze dell'ordine deputate al servizio ai seggi nelle due giornate di voto referendario, il prossimo 20 e 21 settembre. Un'operazione che, per il Comune di Pordenone, è stata e sarà impegnativa non solo da un punto di vista logistico e organizzativo, ma anche finanziario. La spesa complessiva del trasloco dei seggi e dell'adeguamento della Fiera per le casse comunali è di centomila euro.   I SEGGI SPOSTATI   Saranno 48 le sezioni elettorali che troveranno posto in quattro padiglioni fieristici nei quali dovranno essere allestite delle sale-box (con porte da poter essere chiuse a chiave) in cui montare le cabine elettorali e custodire le urne con le schede. Non rientreranno nello spostamento i due seggi elettorali dell'ospedale Santa Maria degli Angeli e il seggio di Villanova Vecchia che si trova in una ex scuola non più operativa. Inoltre sarà mantenuto come sempre il seggio volante per consentire il voto nelle casa di riposo. Nei padiglioni fieristici saranno anche ricavati servizi, docce e stanze per il riposo degli agenti delle forze dell'ordine chiamate a prestare servizio ai seggi. Inoltre saranno ricavate anche della sale di attesa con circa 140 sedie in modo che gli elettori possano attendere comodamente e in sicurezza il loro turno per entrare in cabina ed esprimere il voto. L'operazione voto in Fiera consentirà la continuità didattica nelle dodici scuole della città dove tradizionalmente si vota. «Sarebbe stato pazzesco - commenta il sindaco Alessandro Ciriani con soddisfazione per aver portato a termine l'iniziativa - fermare un'altra volta la scuola solo due giorni dopo l'inizio delle lezioni. Il diritto di bambini e ragazzi di andare finalmente a scuola è sacrosanto, così come il diritto dei docenti di esercitare il loro ruolo e il diritto delle famiglie di non subire ulteriori carichi dopo mesi di lockdown. Nelle prossime ore pubblicheremo sul sito del Comune e sui social la dislocazione dei seggi all'interno dei padiglioni della Fiera. Saranno tutti concentrati lì con l'eccezione dei seggi ospedalieri 24 e 25 e del seggio 43, quello di Villanova vecchia, che rimarrà dov'è perché non è una scuola. E' stato uno sforzo rilevante perché le regole erano stringenti e hanno impedito di aprire seggi distribuiti in tutta la città. Con la soluzione della Fiera tuteliamo la salute e rispettiamo scrupolosamente le ora che per il referendum non si vota nei soliti seggi, per cui chiedo ai concittadini di diffondere la notizia». Un'altra dozzina di richieste da parte di altri Comuni con piani alternativi deve essere ancora valutata dalla Prefettura. Sono soprattutto i Comuni più piccoli ad avere difficoltà a trovare le strutture adeguate in alternativa alle scuole. Perciò saranno diversi i casi, nei Comuni della provincia, in cui le scuole dovranno sospendere l'attività due giorni dopo il suono della campanella di inizio anno scolastico.

I don’t think it is correct. In many of the big names’ offices, they groom and produce senior advocates and other successful lawyers. There is this argument I heard somewhere: that only SANs take all the big cases; that SANs don’t consult themselves; that is the clients that consult them. So, will I tell clients that don’t come to me because others are complaining? We are in a competitive market. We are running a capitalist system. It is like somebody selling gari complaining that somebody is selling more than she is selling. People go to those who would give them best of services. That is the point. That is why we should all aspire to be at the top of our game. Those you call big names, did they start big? We all started from nowhere, from scratch.

“He is a special player. Any school that doesn’t offer him to play slot or returner is nuts. You can see him when he’s in the open field. The kid is just unbelievable and I am glad he’s on our team.”
 With the help Molica’s two rushing touchdowns, the Rangers went ahead, 20-0.
 Despite the hot start of North, University responded with the Solomon Perez to Brian Kellon touchdown-connection to cut the deficit to two possessions.
 But North had one last long run in them. This time, Ward went 57 yards on senior night for the Rangers’ fourth rushing touchdown of the half.
 Then, the Perez-to-Kellon connection came with 29 seconds remaining in the half. In just his second career football game, Perez had two touchdowns on three receptions for 75 yards in one half.
 “I am getting used to it — my fellow wide receivers and fellow teammates. Of course my quarterback, who is also in his first year as the starter,” Kellon said describing his transition to football. “I have always wanted to play football. I finally decided to play.”
 To start the second half, North's Curtis Thomas returned and interception for a touchdown. At the start of the fourth quarter, Joey Skolny intercepted Perez to seal Eastlake North’s first victory of the season.
 “We have a long way to go. We have a talented but young football team. We just have to have the mindset that we have to keep improving and we have an opportunity to continue to improve,” University School head coach Ben Malbasa said.
 The Preppers fell to 0-2 on the season and will play Lutheran East next week. North (1-1) plays Madison next week.

You see, that is why democracy is supposed to be a representative government. And that is why our legislators should make themselves available to their constituents so they can listen to them. That there is inflation in this country… Last time, they said it is about 12.6 per cent, which is very high. Given the harshness and economic misfortune which COVID-19 pandemic has brought upon all of us, I think the government would have to do more to provide palliatives, and not in terms of distributing rice and gari. I mean real palliatives in the sense of looking at the sectors and intervene decisively. For example, the poorest of the poor, look at the aged people, maybe from 60, 70 and above, and intervene in their affairs. This should not be difficult to identify. So, I believe quite honestly that the government has a lot to do in this and to first of all ensure that all the indices that produce inflation are reduced to the minimum and then at decisive point, intervene by giving succour to the underprivileged and the vulnerable. I think that is the way to go.

"We all want a season for the kids, but I would not want it to conflict with another season. Everybody loses in that situation," he said. "I hope it's something that is done in good faith and something everybody believes in. I don't want it to be something where we are just kicking the can down the road. It feels that way right now. If I feel that way, I know that some of our parents and kids do, too."
 Stonington athletic director Bryan Morrone, who also serves as president of the ECC, said league officials plan to meet next week to consider their options.
 "The bomb dropped today and we are trying to pick up the pieces," Morrone said.
 The CIAC said it will work to provide football players "meaningful low to moderate risk fall activities."
 Morrone said playing 7 vs. 7 contests without contact or tackling is a possibility. Some have said such a move would eliminate linemen, but Morrone suggested 7 vs. 7 contests could be divided into groups, one involving linemen and the other involving skill players.
 Morrone and Massengale met with school principal Mark Friese on Friday morning and they discussed a number of options for the football program.
 "Today will not be the end [of football]," Massengale said. "I don't know what it will exactly look like moving forward, but it will be worthwhile, fun and competitive."
 Morrone said at the very least the school could offer an internal 7 vs. 7 football league.
 "We have not issued any football equipment and we won't be issuing any," Morrone said. "At this point there will be no football like we know it. It's very disheartening. I feel bad for the kids, especially the seniors. But they are not the first group of kids to be denied something. We went through this in the spring."
 The CIAC said it would move forward with another sport deemed high risk, girls volleyball, this fall. Players will be required to wear face coverings, which reduce risk, according to the CIAC.
 Girls volleyball joins soccer, field hockey, cross country and swimming as viable fall sports. Teams will play a condensed season with less games and regional schedules, according to the CIAC plan announced in late July.
 Full team practices will begin on Sept. 21 with games scheduled to begin on Oct. 1.

 # McVey, Jaguars fall one stroke short of title
 By The Examiner staff
 Blue Springs South’s Maya McVey beat the next best score by seven strokes.
 But it wasn’t quite enough to put the Jaguars girls golf team over the top in the Independence Invitational Friday at Drumm Farm Golf Club.
 McVey fired a 79 on the par-72 course to earn medalist honors but the Jaguars finished one stroke away from the title. South totaled 382 to finish just behind Lee’s Summit West’s 381.
 Raymore-Peculiar’s Sarah Larkins had the next lowest score with an 86.
 Maddie Brennaman shot a season-best 92, Dilynn Jones shot 101 and Lexi Frederick and Stephanie Giron each carded 110 for the Jaguars.
 Blue Springs, led by Julianna Marshal’s 93 and Lauren Mack’s 97, finished fourth at 402. Lee’s Summit North, paced by Harrison Clemmons’ 93, was fifth at 403.
 Co-host Truman was sixth at 435 behind Katelyn Bragg’s 97. St. Michael the Archangel Catholic, led by Avery Basler’s 101, was seventh at 439. Fort Osage, paced by Brooklynn Gilpin’s 115, was ninth at 488, and co-host Chrisman was 10th at 495, led by 121s from Zoe McConnell and Josephine Shaw.
 Annika Tsay shot 90, Leah Schroer fired a 92 and Brylie Ellis had a 93 to lead West to the title.

Greenwood Christian rolled past rival Spartanburg Christian 41-13 Friday to earn its second consecutive win to open the season.
 The Hawks lost a four-year lineman to injury early and trailed 13-7 midway through the second quarter before scoring 34 unanswered points to put the game out of reach.
 “The effort of our guys was really good as we handled adversity after getting down early,” Greenwood Christian coach Jolly Doolittle said. “It was our first time being down all year, and we’re proud of how our guys handled that.”
 The victory gave Greenwood Christian its fourth consecutive win over familiar non-region foe Spartanburg Christian. Spartanburg Christian is one of the few schools Greenwood Christian competes against in middle school and at the varsity level every year.
 “Our guys circle this game on the schedule every year when it comes out, and I’m sure their guys do too,” Doolittle said. “These games traditionally play pretty close, regardless of our records. Our guys know what to expect going into these games. When you can get four in a row against your rival, that’s definitely a good feeling, for sure.”
 Running backs Cale Mack and Ethan Connor and quarterback Peyton Moore once again led the way offensively for the Hawks. Greenwood Christian’s defense also recorded a touchdown.
 “Those three guys really stood out again, and we did a good job up front,” Doolittle said. “We had to insert some new guys in there after the injury to a four-year lineman, but they stepped up and did a really good job.”
 Greenwood Christian will host Augusta Christian at 7:30 p.m. next Friday.

L'ALLARME   ROVIGO Di colpo il quadro muta: 17 positività alla Casa di cura di Porto Viro, un focolaio i cui confini sono ancora da delimitare e che per il momento vede contagiati dieci pazienti ricoverati nel reparto di Medicina e 7 degli 80 operatori sottoposti al tampone. Nel frattempo, sempre ieri, è stato riaperto il primo modulo da 4 posti letto, dei 24 totali, della Terapia intensiva Covid di Trecenta. Un doppio colpo che inevitabilmente cambia la prospettiva e che porta il direttore generale dell'Ulss Polesana Antonio Compostella a dirsi «non allarmato, ma preoccupato». Il direttore generale spiega come «in queste ore verranno eseguiti altri tamponi agli ospiti di altri reparti e a tutto il personale, poi lo screening sarà ripetuto. Non nascondo che ci attendiamo che possano emergere altre positività. Per il momento i dieci degenti positivi, al di là dei sintomi di base per i quali erano ricoverati, non sembrano presentare sintomi Covid-correlati e rimangono isolati nella Casa di cura, che ha bloccato i ricoveri internistici, con l'attività supportata dall'ospedale di Adria così come per l'attività del Pronto soccorso, perché quello di Porto Viro per alcuni giorni funzionerà a regime ridotto. Se dovessero esserci evoluzioni, verrebbero presi in carico da noi e se vi dovesse essere la necessità, siamo pronti a riaprire l'Area Covid di Trecenta».   TRECENTA RIAPRE   Il San Luca, dunque, torna a rivestire la funzione di polo Covid, dopo i lavori che hanno interessato la piastra chirurgica per la realizzazione definitiva della Terapia intensiva Covid. Se per la riapertura del primo blocco di posti letto di Terapia intensiva Covid, come sottolineato da Compostella e dal direttore sanitario Edgardo Contato, sono già stati programmati i turni, l'eventuale riapertura dell'Area medica Covid, al quarto piano, dove sono rimasti attrezzati altri 80 posti letto, 20 dei quali di Terapia subintensiva, «renderebbe necessaria un ragionamento sulle altre attività e sulla riorganizzazione interna, anche perché in questo momento facciamo fatica ad assumere nuovi infermieri».   Nel momento di massima espansione epidemica il San Luca è arrivato ad accogliere 16 pazienti Covid, ma c'erano il blocco delle attività ordinarie e una maggior disponibilità di personale. Il 4 giugno era rimasta vuota. L'alta marea, come l'aveva chiamata Compostella, si era esaurita, ma il livello sta tornando a salire. I ricoverati per Covid al momento sono quattro, uno in Terapia intensiva a Trecenta e tre in Malattie infettive a Rovigo. Dei tre, un'anziana già necessita di supporti respiratori ed è per questo che se ne prevede il trasferimento a Trecenta nelle prossime ore. Si tratta della paziente che era arrivava con sintomi respiratori dalla Casa di cura di Porto Viro, dove era stata ricoverata una dozzina di giorni prima. «Al momento dell'ingresso - evidenzia il direttore generale - era stata sottoposta al tampone e probabilmente si trovava nella cosiddetta fase finestra, ovvero fra il contatto con il virus e lo sviluppo dell'infezione, quando anche l'esecuzione corretta del tampone non dà risultato di positività per la bassa carica virale».   ALTRO CASO IN OSPEDALE   A complicare ulteriormente il quadro, la positività di un medico dell'ospedale di Rovigo, una specializzanda in Anestesia e Rianimazione, residente fuori provincia. «La positività - spiega Compostella - è emersa durante lo screening dei dipendenti. Sembra che il virus sia stato contratto all'esterno. Tutti i nostri dipendenti utilizzano i dispositivi di protezione individuale durante il lavoro, ma è in corso lo screening di tutti i pazienti e dei possibili contatti all'interno dell'ospedale».   C'è un'ulteriore positività, emersa in un 57enne di Rovigo, sottoposto al tampone per la comparsa di sintomi sospetti e poi posto in isolamento domiciliare, mentre con la ricostruzione dei suoi contatti si sta cercando di individuare dove e come possa essersi contagiato, mettendo al contempo in isolamento le persone che hanno avuto rapporti stretti. Ieri si sono registrate cinque guarigioni, un segnale incoraggiante.   Francesco Campi   © RIPRODUZIONE RISERVATA

The Rangers sent rookie pitchers Kyle Cody (0-1) and John King to the mound in a piggyback start, and both made crucial mistakes.
 Cody walked Kyle Seager in the second inning, then threw a pick-off attempt wide to advance him to second. Seager scored on Ty France’s first hit as a Mariner for a 1-0 lead.
 King hit Seager in the fourth and walked France before Evan White — another rookie — hit a two-run double off the wall in left field for a 3-0 lead.
 King became the third Rangers prospect this season and the ninth in team history to jump directly from high-A to the major leagues with his debut. Cody, who struck out two and walked two, made the same transition last month. He gave up one hit in three innings.
