The first thing to consider is that the privacy and compliance landscape is a complex and ever- changing environment in today's world. The GDPR is often called Europe's first and most successful export for a reason - many other countries are now introducing their own Privacy regulations such as the LGPD in Brazil and PDPA in Thailand. Because of this, it's definitely worth engaging with a partner that is in the trenches on these to support you in not just getting compliant today but remaining compliant in the long term.

 The Bicentennial, of course, is a nation-wide observation of the 200th birthday of our nation. It is a good time, in an aftermath of political corruption, and in the midst of recession and unemployment, to rededicate ourselves and and to become reaware of all that our country stands for. Troubled times are always a good time to close ranks and reunite.
 Because of the patriotic nature of the event, the City of Hamilton, Ill. has looked back into its past to find a good foundation on which to build its Bicentennial program. The three-day festival, planned for August 15, 16 and 17, is patterned somewhat after an event which was born in the midst of some of the most serious and trying years America has ever faced.

 Economic prosperity, for an individual and a region, begins with a single stepping stone: education.
 That's why, as the leaders of the higher education organizations in the Rock River Valley, we believe our collaborations result in even more opportunities for area individuals.
 Our top three area community colleges -- Highland Community College, Kishwaukee College and Rock Valley College -- are partnering with Rockford University, the region's leading private, four-year institution, to provide a flexible and seamless transfer of credits toward a degree in business or accounting at the Puri School of Business at Rockford University. By streamlining the process by which area students can transfer credits and complete bachelor's degrees more quickly, we expect to contribute to an enhanced regional educational attainment level.
 This partnership also has the potential to improve the region's economic stability and potential. With more highly trained workers entering our local workforce, area businesses will have the availability of talent to compete with companies nationally and worldwide.
 The Rockford region has long depended on exemplary workforce training to set itself apart economically. Evolving from a tradition of manufacturing excellence, we've expanded our economic base to include the aerospace industry, automotive and food processing, as well as logistics and distribution. With our region's reputation for centers of excellence in these areas and others growing, it's now up to higher education institutions to prepare our existing workforce so that employers have a pool of qualified candidates, right here.
 Community colleges are critical to the fabric of every single community. They're often a starting place for students -- no matter their age or experience -- to begin their post-secondary educational journey. They offer valuable programs that develop specific job skills, ever-important \"soft skills,\" and the capability and confidence to think creatively and critically. They provide students the ability to enhance their income potential by earning an associate's degree, and in turn, can impact an entire family's trajectory.
 After completing an associate's degree, many students want to further their education. This partnership removes another hurdle in that process that prevents students from attaining their goals. It allows for the easy transfer of earned college credits at their full value and makes it possible for community colleges to offer clear guidance and encouragement to students from the very beginning of their journey.
 The partnership between Rockford University and the area's community colleges also helps working adults achieve their goals. The students enrolling in the degree completion program at Rockford University are at a different life stage than many traditional college students. They have demanding jobs, families, and other obligations to manage and yet still need to advance their careers and earning potential by developing skills and getting their bachelor's degree. Rockford University's Puri School of Business is innovating ways to put a bachelor's degree in business or accounting more easily within reach for these adults. This includes the partnership with area community colleges, accepting documented work training for up to 25 credit hours, online and in- person classes, flexible scheduling and more.
 Working together is nothing new for educational institutions in northern Illinois. While there have been long-standing partnerships between our schools for many years, this newest collaboration takes that relationship a step further for the benefit of our students, our region's employers, and our community's future. We envision many more students securing bachelor's degrees in the years to come, a trend we can all celebrate.
  _Eric Fulcomer is president of Rockford University; Laurie Borowicz is president of Kishwaukee College; Beth Young is interim president of Rock Valley College; and Chris Kuberski is president of Highland Community College._

WEST OLIVE -- Access to high-speed internet was identified as a key goal for Ottawa County to improve during a board of commissioners work session on Thursday, Aug. 6.
   
 Increasing access to broadband services, particularly for residents living in rural areas of the county, has been a priority for county officials in the past.
   
 County administrator Al Vanderberg said although broadband access isn't something the county can use taxpayer funds for, the county can seek grants and partnerships with other public and private partners to increase the availability of high-speed internet.
   
 "We could be part of a community collaborative that finds a way that we can be a leader and work with, the (Ottawa Area Intermediate School District), to find a way for a countywide broadband authority and have the voters vote for it (possibly)," Vanderberg said.
   
 Vanderberg said access to high-speed internet has become a more pressing issue in light of the coronavirus, which forced many employees and students to either work from home or try to engage in remote learning.
   
 "It's a big problem that needs to be solved," he added. "It's one that could have an impact on our growth, and it could have an impact on quality of life and the ability of people -- especially as cold it requires people to be home more in the future -- to be able to keep up on school studies."
   
 There are several initiatives at the federal government level to increase broadband access in rural areas. The Rural Digital Opportunity Fund is a $20 billion initiative to bring high speed internet to areas that lack it. The RDOF identifies areas in northern Ottawa County as potential places where broadband access needs to be implemented.
   
 At the county level, Ottawa County has formed a Broadband Advisory Committee, made up of over two dozen public and private sector officials. The committee is tasked with identifying grant opportunities and public partners to work with to bolster access to high speed internet in Ottawa County.

Acne is a common skin condition that is estimated to affect nearly 10% of the world’s population. It occurs when the pores of your skin become blocked with oil, dead skin, or bacteria. There are different types of acne - whiteheads (closed plugged pores), blackheads (open plugged pores), small red and tender bumps (papules), pimples (papules with pus at their tips), nodules (large, solid, painful lumps), cystic lesions (painful, pus-filled lumps. Though it affects people of all ages, it is most common among teenagers.Many factors can trigger or aggravate acne including excess oil production, hormonal changes, acne-causing bacteria, blocked pores and inflammation. Some studies have also shown that diet can play a significant role in acne development. Eating certain foods can raise your blood sugar more quickly and influence the body to release insulin. When you have excess insulin in your blood, your oil glands will produce more oil, thus increases your risk of developing acne. Here are 5 foods that can trigger spikes in insulin and cause acne.

The Timing and Entry Point for CRON Stock
 Admittedly, there is at best an awful lot of uncertainty in this bull case. It's still anyone's guess how the industry will play out in coming years. Personally, I'm less bullish on U.S. federal legalization than some. And execution does have to get better. If it doesn't, Cronos falls behind in both Canada and Israel, leaving the risk that there's not much of a catalyst (save for fermentation) for potentially several years.
 There's also a reasonably significant catalyst problem. CRON stock has declined 59% over the past year, during which time this same broad bull case could have been made. Given operating losses that are still at a $100 million- plus annual run-rate, the cash balance doesn't necessarily create a hard floor under the stock.
 But with cash at 60% of the market cap, there is some downside protection. Selling puts can add more: the January 2021 4 strike leaves the choice of either double-digit returns in five-plus months or owning Cronos at an enterprise value close to zero.
 Even as a straight buy, CRON at the least is intriguing. For an enterprise value under $900 million fully diluted, investors get the Altria partnership, the fermentation opportunity, and potential optionality from a win elsewhere. Fermention, assuming Raymond James is on point, plus cash value the stock over $7. Optionality could include a rebound in Canada, success in Israel (where Cronos seems to be investing heavily), or improved growth in vaporizers as pandemic impacts recede. More broadly, the combination of Altria's backing and superior flexibility to invest behind the existing business and/or acquire new ones suggests that Cronos should be able to start winning somewhere at some point. If it doesn't, new management no doubt will get its chance.
 Again, the fundamental case doesn't seem to support much optimism. But that doesn't mean there's no case at all. There are risks, but there are substantial rewards as well. Cronos still has a solid chance of being one of the big winners in cannabis. That should be enough for big upside, even if that upside takes some patience.

So while the sequential improvements that we're seeing are encouraging, the short-term picture does remain challenged. That said the cost actions that we've taken will meaningfully mitigate revenue declines. Additionally, our current cash balance and a path to more cash through the Tower deal give us confidence in our ability to not only stay the course, but to capitalize on the rebounding economy when and where it occurs, and continue our aggressive debt reduction and invest to drive growth.

"It's a pretty decent park but it's not a big-league park," Hill said. "You could make the argument in a roundabout way that the (Blue Jays) might have an advantage. They'll play there more often.
 "They can get used to it and know what to expect and these teams coming from a big-league park into a triple-A park are going to have the bigger challenge."
 Like many pro athletes, baseball players can be creatures of habit. Sightlines, lighting irregularities, infield dirt quality, mound height and grass style can all take some getting used to depending on the athlete.
 Hill, now a scout with the New York Yankees, said lighting quality will likely be the most important factor for players.
 "All big-league parks you're under bright, bright lights and you can see everything," said Hill. "You're talking about being able to see the spin on the ball more effectively. Being able to read the hitter's swing. That first step for an outfielder, those first couple feet off the bat, are they able to make the reaction the same way?
 "Are they able to track it, turn and run, and then turn back and pick the ball up again? When the ball is glowing, it's much easier to do. Under dim light, it's a little bit harder to take your eye off the ball completely. So there's those different factors that you might see."
 Toronto's first four home games are scheduled to be played in the evening under the lights.
 "I know some of the hitters were complaining about the (scoreboard) being right in centre field, in the batter's eye, it kind of messed with them," Pearson recalled from his time with the Bisons. "It'll be interesting to see what they do about that, whether they leave it off or whatnot."
 The Blue Jays were able to work out in Toronto last month at summer training camp. The government approved the temporary setup of players training at Rogers Centre and isolating themselves at an attached hotel.
 However, a proposal to play regular-season games there was kiboshed by Ottawa due to concern about players travelling in and out of the country from U.S. states ravaged by the COVID-19 pandemic.
 The Blue Jays tried to make plans to share big-league facilities in Pittsburgh and Baltimore but were unsuccessful. The team eventually went with the familiar border city of Buffalo.
 "It's kind of almost going backwards where the young Jays team would be the team that would probably be OK just throwing them into any old park and they'll adjust on the fly," Hill said. "Because they probably aren't as fine- tuned and as habitual and routine-oriented in what they need and want and feel. Whereas you can get some of those salty veteran teams coming in and they're going to notice a difference."

The Broncos, who were smashed 6-1 in Game 2 at Thayer, secured a 2-1 victory to earn their first trip in the state semifinals in over a decade. The victory earned Carlow bragging rights over future UMass-Boston teammate and Toll Gate standout Matt Anthony.
 “That game comes up and Matt and [former Toll Gate standout and current Smithfield coach Rob Jackson] don’t like to talk about it much,” Carlow said. “You throw a couple of shots in there.”
 The comeback and series victory were great accomplishments for Cahill, a Burrillville resident who taught special education in North Smithfield for 32 seasons.
 Cahill, like most kids who grow up in Burrillville, had hockey in his blood. Unlike most kids in Burrillville, he didn’t go to Burrillville or Mount, but rather Our Lady of Providence a defunct Catholic school in Warwick Neck. Cahill started the school’s hockey program in 1974.
 He coached at North Smithfield High for 20 seasons – winning titles in 1985 and 1991 – before taking over a senior-heavy Burrillville squad in 1994.
 “I was a relatively new coach with the group and I kind of burned them hard at practice,” Cahill said. “I ran a strict program and wanted everyone to be on the same page. I put the pressure on the seniors all year long and I made them work hard.”
 Cahill had a soft place in his heart for Lacey, who was a hard-working defenseman. He even named a practice drill after Lacey – but it’s not a positive honor. The Broncos did a drill in practice where they have to crisscross the ice and the point is to make sure you’re skating with your head up.
 At one practice, Lacey collided with a teammate and had to be taken out of the rink in a rescue, hence it became known in Burrillville hockey lore as the Lacey Drill.
 “Billy was a hard-working kid who would do whatever you asked of him. He gave you everything he had,” Cahill said.
 Just three days after beating the Titans, the Broncos made the familiar march up Broncos Highway to Adelard Arena to face a Mount team that was ranked No. 7 in the country.
 All Burrillville did in the first game was secure a 1-1 tie before the series shifted back to Levy Rink the following night.
 “It was fantastic to play Mount. When you were playing them, you were playing at the highest level,” Cahill said.
 “I knew coach Belisle and he was good to me. It wasn't a friendly rivalry, but as coach you have to respect the program. You like to challenge yourself and the team because Bill Belisle would never tell his team to stop putting the biscuit in the basket.”
 “We weren’t intimidated by them because a lot of those kids were from Burrillville and we grew up playing on the same team,” Carlow said.
 Mount – as the Mounties did in back in the day – responded with an 8-1 victory in Game 2 and a 5-1 victory in Game 3 before beating Bishop Hendricken in three games to clinch their 18th straight title.

TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — La Tropicana Cafe has been a cornerstone of Tampa’s historic Latin-influenced Ybor City neighborhood since the 1960s, well known as a gathering spot where movers and shakers and even mobsters mixed with construction workers over Cuban coffee and sandwiches. Now its doors are likely closed for good, like so many other bars and restaurants done in by the coronavirus pandemic. Every neighborhood loses something precious when local eateries and hangouts get shuttered, but as infections spread and the economic fallout continues, the loss of iconic establishments like La Tropicana is particularly hard to swallow. “In Tampa, if you were a politician, La Tropicana was where you would show up,\" said Patrick Manteiga, editor and publisher of La Gaceta, a local newspaper that publishes in English, Spanish and Italian. For years, his father, Roland Manteiga, kept a corner table reserved for himself, with a special red telephone to call in scoops. There are photos of the elder Manteiga with Presidents Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush, Florida Govs. Bob Martinez and Lawton Chiles, and local politicians of all stripes. It was also frequently reported in local media that Tampa's longtime mob boss, Santo Trafficante Jr., sometimes stopped by. “La Tropicana become a favorite hangout. You could go in, talk a little politics, get your name in the paper,” Patrick Manteiga said. “If you’re a powerbroker trying to have lunch on the cheap, it was the place to go.” The Ybor City landmark is hardly alone in shutting down for good. Iconic spots from San Francisco to New York also won’t be back. Restaurants are traditionally low-margin businesses in high-rent locations, with little in cash reserves.

 “Imagine if employees didn’t wash their hands or cooks could stick their bare fingers into your food and the owner said simply, ‘Hey, no big deal,‘” Pritzker said. “Imagine if someone could walk into a restaurant, light a cigarette, blow smoke in your face, and all the smoker had to say is, ‘Well, it’s my choice.‘”

Nebraska failed on a two-point conversion attempt with 48 seconds left that would have won the game and the national championship. A successful kick would have tied the score.

O'Brien joined Toronto in 2018 after stints with Salford, Warrington Wolves, Swinton Lions, St Helens, Widnes Vikings and North Wales Crusaders. He spent two games on loan with Castleford while with Warrington, where he graduated from the Wolves academy.
 O'Brien was named player of the year in the second-tier Betfred Championship in 2019 after scoring 22 tries in 27 games.
 "Gareth is a high-quality player who will fit in very neatly into the way that we attack, and he'll really strengthen us, I think, for the remainder of this season," Castleford head coach Daryl Powell said in a statement.
 “He's a player that we have looked at before and given what has happened with Toronto and our position with Jordan Rankin going home, I thought it was important to get an experienced fullback on board and strengthen us in that position.”
 Rankin returned to his native Australia in May, signing with the Parramatta Eels in June. The former Gold Coast Titans and Wests Tigers player scored 10 tries in 28 appearances for the Tigers.
 Castleford, which dropped to 4-3-0 after a 40-14 loss Saturday to Catalan Dragons, has been playing winger Greg Eden at fullback.

Economic prosperity, for an individual and a region, begins with a single stepping stone: education.
   
 That's why, as the leaders of the higher education organizations in the Rock River Valley, we believe our collaborations result in even more opportunities for area individuals.
   
 Our top three area community colleges -- Highland Community College, Kishwaukee College and Rock Valley College -- are partnering with Rockford University, the region's leading private, four-year institution, to provide a flexible and seamless transfer of credits toward a degree in business or accounting at the Puri School of Business at Rockford University. By streamlining the process by which area students can transfer credits and complete bachelor's degrees more quickly, we expect to contribute to an enhanced regional educational attainment level.
   
 This partnership also has the potential to improve the region's economic stability and potential. With more highly trained workers entering our local workforce, area businesses will have the availability of talent to compete with companies nationally and worldwide.
   
 The Rockford region has long depended on exemplary workforce training to set itself apart economically. Evolving from a tradition of manufacturing excellence, we've expanded our economic base to include the aerospace industry, automotive and food processing, as well as logistics and distribution. With our region's reputation for centers of excellence in these areas and others growing, it's now up to higher education institutions to prepare our existing workforce so that employers have a pool of qualified candidates, right here.
   
 Community colleges are critical to the fabric of every single community. They're often a starting place for students -- no matter their age or experience -- to begin their post-secondary educational journey. They offer valuable programs that develop specific job skills, ever-important "soft skills," and the capability and confidence to think creatively and critically. They provide students the ability to enhance their income potential by earning an associate's degree, and in turn, can impact an entire family's trajectory.
   
 After completing an associate's degree, many students want to further their education. This partnership removes another hurdle in that process that prevents students from attaining their goals. It allows for the easy transfer of earned college credits at their full value and makes it possible for community colleges to offer clear guidance and encouragement to students from the very beginning of their journey.
   
 The partnership between Rockford University and the area's community colleges also helps working adults achieve their goals. The students enrolling in the degree completion program at Rockford University are at a different life stage than many traditional college students. They have demanding jobs, families, and other obligations to manage and yet still need to advance their careers and earning potential by developing skills and getting their bachelor's degree. Rockford University's Puri School of Business is innovating ways to put a bachelor's degree in business or accounting more easily within reach for these adults. This includes the partnership with area community colleges, accepting documented work training for up to 25 credit hours, online and in- person classes, flexible scheduling and more.
   
 Working together is nothing new for educational institutions in northern Illinois. While there have been long-standing partnerships between our schools for many years, this newest collaboration takes that relationship a step further for the benefit of our students, our region's employers, and our community's future. We envision many more students securing bachelor's degrees in the years to come, a trend we can all celebrate.

It then dawned on Cahill. A number of folks must have left Levy Rink early Monday night in Game 3 of the aforementioned series against DeCosta and the Titans. For those who stayed until the final buzzer following a scoreless overtime, they witnessed a comeback for the ages that ranks as the favorite game of current Burrillville softball coach and 1996 Burrillville High graduate Bill Lacey.
 “Now that you point that out, it’s interesting that my favorite game doesn’t even count,” said Lacey, who was on the bench to witness one of the great comebacks in the storied history of Bronco hockey. “Even 25 years later I can still see myself standing on the second row – back when the benches were more square than they are now – and I remember every moment like how I remember what I had for breakfast this morning.”
 Lacey’s favorite game went down as a 2-2 tie with the Titans, meaning the contest didn’t count and thus the same two teams had to get ready to play a Game 4 at Thayer Ice Arena for the right to play Bill Belisle’s powerhouse Mount St. Charles squad.
 Why is the tie Lacey’s favorite game? Because of what happened in the final 27 seconds of the contest when the Broncos, a squad whose core of seniors were two years removed from winning the Class B title, trailed by two goals and appeared to be cooked.
 “I would love to tell you for sure I thought we were going to tie it up,” said former Bronco and current Medfield coach Toby Carlow. “All I could think at the time was how it sucked that this was the end of my high school career.”
 Being down two goals with 27 seconds left in regulation seems almost impossible against any goalie. The Titans, who were 6-9 that season, didn’t just have any goalie.
 The Warwick-based public school featured one of the most decorated female goalies in the history of hockey in DeCosta, who was one of the reasons why the U.S. women’s hockey game captured the gold medal at the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan.
 In the first 134 minutes and 33 seconds of the series, the Broncos scored just three goals.
 Cahill, in his first year in charge of the Broncos, had to dig deep into his bag of coaching tricks to find a way to beat DeCosta. He decided to channel his inner Gordon Bombay.
 “During a timeout he brought up the movie the Mighty Ducks – I hate that movie,” Carlow said, “but we knew we had to throw everything at the net and there were six of us and five of them.”
 “I just saw coach Cahill a few weeks ago and we were talking about it and he basically tells the seniors to do a Mighty Ducks’ Flying V and just go to the net,” Lacey said. “We won the face-off pulled the goalie and did the Flying V toward their net.”
 With just 15 seconds left in the game, Carlow appeared to score a simple consolation goal when he came from behind the net and wrapped a shot inside DeCosta’s post.
 “After I scored the first goal, I’m thinking it was a hell of a ride but it all depends on winning the face-off,” Carlow said.
 Mike Heroux won the ensuing face-off and that’s when the Broncos received a bit of luck from the referees.
 A Burrillville defenseman clearly iced the puck, but the call wasn’t made. Burrillville rushed into the zone and with the possibility of just seconds remaining in the season, Carlow found space in the slot.
 He rifled a shot past DeCosta to send the game into overtime. Neither team scored in either five-minute session, thus a series that appeared to be over shifted back to Thayer Arena the following night.

Sachin Pilot has already been sacked from his position as party chief in the state as well as deputy chief minister. So he came off worse in the power struggle. He might get the deputy chief ministership back, something that Gehlot will concede in bad grace. Ashok Gehlot was hoping he would be rid of Pilot forever and was creating conditions for his expulsion from the Congress. He will now have to kiss and make up with a man, who is a party colleague, but bitterly critical of him. The trust deficit between the two leaders has never been as high as it is today. Relations will likely turn worse as the elected leader of the Congress Legislature Party (ie Gehlot) will now have to answer to a committee. The members of the committee have not been named yet.

ETFs hold various assets, so they're naturally diversified. Diversification is critical to your success as a retirement investor, because it spreads out your risk and smooths out volatility. If you only invested in a single company, your portfolio balance would shift with each and every movement of that company's share price. And, if that company were to run into tough times and go belly up, it'd take your retirement savings down the drain with it.

By JEFF BAENEN and AMY FORLITI   Associated Press
 MINNEAPOLIS (AP) - Mohamed Noor fled Somalia's civil war as a child, following a well-worn path with his family to a refugee camp in Kenya, the U.S. and eventually Minnesota. After a difficult start, he "fell in love" with his new city, Minneapolis, and carved out a life in business.
 Then he spotted an online ad recruiting police officers.
 "I always wanted to serve," Noor said Thursday, breaking more than 18 months of silence since shooting and killing an unarmed woman who approached his squad car.
 Noor, now 33, is on trial for murder and manslaughter in the July 2017 death of Justine Ruszczyk Damond, a dual U.S.-Australia citizen who had called 911 to report a possible crime minutes before she was shot.
 His testimony added some detail to what was already known about Noor, whose hiring in 2015 was welcomed by city leaders seeking to diversify a police force in a melting-pot city with the nation's largest population of Somalis.
 Noor described his early years near Mogadishu as the oldest of 10 children in a middle-class family whose patriarch both farmed and worked for a non- governmental organization. When he was 5, he said, the family fled to Kenya because of strife in Somalia and spent nearly two years in a refugee camp before his father got a U.S. visa.
 The family lived for about five years in Chicago. Noor didn't know any English when he arrived and was behind in school, but some teachers helped get him caught up. The family then moved to the Minneapolis area, where he found it difficult at first.
 "When I moved here, no one liked Somalis, and I picked that up right away," he testified.
 But things got better after Noor signed up for football and began making friends. He became a citizen in 1999 and eventually graduated from Augsburg University, a school close to the Cedar-Riverside neighborhood that is home to many of the city's Somalis.
 Noor studied economics and business administration and worked as an assistant general manager for a hotel. He was in a job handling pharmaceutical benefits when he spotted the Minneapolis Police Department's ad.
 He joined the force through a 29-week cadet training program and had some bumps. Noor testified Thursday about once clearing the ammunition from his gun incorrectly, leaving a round in the chamber, and being chewed out.
 Damond's death led to questions about Noor's training, but then-Police Chief Janee Harteau said Noor "was very suited to be on the street."
 The cadet program is aimed at finding candidates who already have a two- or four-year college degree in another field, said Nate Gove, executive director of the Minnesota Board of Peace Officer Standards and Training, which sets licensing and training standards for law enforcement agencies and officers.
 "Nobody is waved through the program," Gove said. He said such programs are "not fast track" and that candidates still must meet minimum standards and pass license examinations.
 After Noor completed the program successfully and was assigned to the city's Fifth Precinct, city leaders heralded his arrival.
 "A wonderful sign of building trust and community policing at work," then- Mayor Betsy Hodges posted on Facebook.
 Noor, who is married and has a son from a previous marriage, was fired from the force after he was charged with killing Damond. He renewed his peace officer license a few days later, making him eligible to serve as a police officer until 2021 if he's acquitted and can find employment.
 A felony conviction prevents anyone from being a law officer in Minnesota.

OCEAN PINES - Voters returned two incumbents to the Ocean Pines Association's board of directors.
 A ballot count on Friday revealed that incumbents Colette Horn and Doug Parks received the most votes in this summer's election. Parks collected 2,206 votes, Horn 1,801 and challenger Stuart Lakernick 1,149.
 "We express our appreciation to all of the candidates who have volunteered to serve our association," said Steve Habeger, chairman of the elections committee, as he announced vote totals Friday.
 According to a preliminary report from the committee, 6,975 ballots were mailed. A total of 2,759 ballots were counted on Friday, for a return of 39.6%, including 2,745 scanned ballots and 14 manually counted ballots. The committee reported that 20 ballots were rejected, including 18 which were marked improperly or included comments on the ballot, and two which used improper return envelopes. Another 60 ballots were not counted because they were received one day after the Aug. 5 deadline. Including the rejected and late ballots, the 2020 return rate was 40.7%.

“Local newspapers and journalists are vital to the public, especially within our rural communities in West Virginia,” McKinley said in a recent press release about the bill’s introduction. “These publications are the lifeblood of small towns, providing readers with coverage they can’t get anywhere else. They also play an important role in the local economy.”
 McKinley said Thursday that the goal of the legislation is to incentivize the areas where newspapers get their revenue, subscribers and advertising.
 “By providing tax credits for readers and local businesses we can address both these areas,” he said via email. “The credits will encourage readers to subscribe to local publications, help those publications retain and compensate journalists, and help boost advertising revenue from local businesses. All of this is aimed to stabilize an industry that has been struggling — not only since the pandemic hit but in the past decades.”
 Rebecca Snyder, the executive director of the Maryland-Delaware-D.C. Press Association, said the bill is a much-welcome show of support from national leadership, “and those provisions are really critical to the news media industry.”
 Speaking in terms of the region her organization serves, Snyder said, “our members really are hurting. (COVID-19) has really decimated advertising, for some of our members by up to 75% year over year. It’s crazy shocking.” However, she added, newspapers and businesses all over are struggling.
 Those numbers, Snyder said, are indicative of a problem in the broader business community and not just the local news industry. As COVID-19 has gravely affected the bottom line for many businesses, she explained, it’s created problems all around.
 Things have slowly started to rebound as the pandemic has progressed, Snyder noted, but not by leaps and bounds. April was especially tough for MDDC members, she said, which reported on average that they’d run 25% of the amount of advertisements as they had at the same point in 2019.
 “Certainly no one is back at full strength, and newspapers were operating at razor-thin margins to begin with,” Snyder said. “This is something with so much uncertainty around it that consumers aren’t willing to go out and frequent businesses, businesses aren’t sure what they should or could do and maybe don’t have the cash to advertise as well, and so it’s this difficult cycle around.”
 While subscribers are also vital, advertising, she said, is primarily how newspapers pay their bills.

Furthermore, there are also situations in which the multilateral interdependence of economies calls for restricting current-account deficits or surpluses. Unsustainable deficits of large, financially integrated economies are such a case, as a crisis associated to them may trigger cross-border effects.
 There are additionally two conceivable situations in which surpluses can be deemed as in excess:
 1\. When current-account surpluses are the result of deliberate strategies of curbing domestic demand and deliberate exchange rate undervaluation, crowding out foreign competitors. On the other hand, given the simultaneous determination of savings and current account balances, it is always hard to disentangle such a strategy from other determinants of the current-account balance.
 2\. When an increase of one economy's surplus takes place while others face difficulties to absorb it without suffering adverse, durable effects on their demand and output. This is the case when part of the world is caught in a "liquidity trap", unable to resort to lowering domestic interest rates as an adjustment policy, or face obstacles to use countervailing fiscal policies.
 The IMF External Sector Report offers assessments comparing actual current account balances - and correlated real effective exchange rates (REERs) - with those that would reflect medium-term fundamentals and desired policies. Figure 4 displays its assessment of how intensively each one of the 30 largest individual economies last year exhibited current accounts - and REERs - out of line or in line with their "fundamentals", i.e. those features that would normally lead them to feature current account imbalances within certain estimated country-specific ranges - see Cubeddu et al (2019) for an update of the methodology. Stronger (weaker) corresponds to REER "undervaluation" ("overvaluation"). Stronger (weaker) also means that a current account balance is larger (smaller) than that "consistent with fundamentals and desirable policies".

Foreign guest worker programs and outsourcing are two heads of the same monster decimating  the working class and blue collar workers -- the same people that propelled Donald Trump to victory in 2016. These policies harm Americans by robbing them of the opportunity to earn a fair wage at a decent job. This reality underscores the importance of President Trump's recent executive order that protects these workers by mandating that all federal agencies focus on hiring citizens for federal contracts, among other measures.
 The order is a direct reaction to the news that the federally-owned Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) planned to export as much as 20 percent of their work overseas while slashing 120 American jobs, with plans to cut another 100. This sort of action would be cause for uproar at a private company. At a government-owned corporation, it is outrageous. The TVA is a large employer across parts of the rural South, a region that lags behind the nation in economic development, where the company provides electricity and jobs for residents.
 The Trump administration was right to crack down on the TVA for attempting to simultaneously outsource 20 percent of its work overseas while replacing some remaining domestic jobs with H-1B guest workers. Unfortunately, companies engage in this kind of behavior all of the time. For blue-collar workers there is no greater threat to their livelihood than the dual peril of outsourcing and foreign guest workers. In either case, employers are opting for  cheaper foreign labor, whether it be overseas or right here in the United States.
 The rationale for outsourcing jobs is almost always to cut costs on labor, regardless of the impact on American workers. A number of things contributed to the growing trend of companies outsourcing certain parts of their operations, including high taxes, burdensome regulations, and  insatiable greed by corporate leaders who place profits and dividends over the lives of their employees. According to The Balance, outsourcing mostly impacts those employed in technology, call centers, human resources, and manufacturing. This worsened with the adoption of disastrous trade policies like the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Then-candidate Donald Trump made overturning NAFTA a key promise of his 2016 campaign, in an overture to the workers whose livelihoods NAFTA destroyed.
  President Trump addressed some of the incentive to outsource jobs by renegotiating trade agreements. But bringing jobs home means absolutely nothing if companies then turn around and fill those positions with foreign guest workers. Research shows that guest workers, especially in the H-2B non- skilled and H-1B skilled visa programs, are cheaper to hire than Americans performing the same jobs. The H-1B program is particularly egregious because Americans are often fired and then forced by their former employers to train their foreign replacements.
 Many people believe that Americans are lazy and unmotivated workers. Forcing them to compete against H-1B and H-2B guest workers willing to work for significantly less reinforces this stereotype. The result of guest worker programs, inevitably, is that Americans miss out on opportunities right here in the United States.
 How can someone expect to earn a living if the biggest employer in their area decides to move their job out of the country? And how can that same worker find a new job if they must compete against a foreign worker willing to work for significantly less money? Outsourcing and foreign guest worker programs jam American workers squarely between a rock and a hard place.
 Fortunately, there are ways that our country can reverse these trends. President Trump took action to prioritize the hiring of American workers through the renegotiation of NAFTA, his Hire American, Buy American executive order and  last week's directive "Aligning Federal Contracting and Hiring Practices. But these actions merely scratch the surface of what is possible. While eliminating guest worker programs requires an act of Congress, the president can direct federal agencies through rulemaking to raise the cost of participating in the H-1B and H-2B programs, eliminating the financial incentive to hire a foreign guest worker instead of an American. On the outsourcing front, the president signed a tax cut that lowered the cost of doing business in the US, hoping to lure back companies that sent jobs overseas.
 If the president wants to win a second term, he needs to prove to the American working class that he is willing to continue fighting for them. Facing off against outsourcing and foreign guest worker programs would go a long way in showing American workers whose side he is on.

As a final comment, it’s plausible that Google management could have anticipated announcement of the ADT partnership would have provoked a positive market response, and that they would have expected the value of the at-the- money option to quickly expand. If this is true, it means that Google baked in a meaningful per-share effective discount to its 6.6% purchase. If that's true, then Google may have a more bearish view of ADT's future business prospects than the market seems to.
 I believe the option embedded in the Google - ADT deal is an underappreciated incremental negative for ADT. I also believe this additional deal element illustrates Google's market power as an investor, an almost Warren Buffett - like knight in shining armor whose seal of approval is worth a substantial discount to market prices.
 ## Conclusion
 Google’s purchase of a 6.6% stake in ADT and the accompanying partnership may well be valuable to both firms, and could be bullish for ADT’s long run prospects. The option embedded in the deal adds a wrinkle that the market may not fully appreciate. Investors should watch carefully for any further announcements concerning Google’s use of its option. Not exercising the option would seem on the surface bearish for ADT, or reflective of possible negative consequences for Google that are external to the deal. If the market bids ADT up following news that Google exercised this option, that should be cause for general investor concern on a sentiment basis.

So we're continuing to work through that, and that will definitely help reduce LOE. And then some of the things that we were fortunate in getting done in the quarter, working with the utility company to get meters set and get ahead of the schedule there or got moved up in the schedule from some good relationships, we ended up getting generators off of our payroll, and those are very, very expensive.
