Biotechnology major Biocon and its arm Biocon Biologics have activated business continuity plans across their functions to prepare for unforeseen events in light of the evolving COVID-19 situation. The plans have been activated also to meet the needs of patients, partners, customers and other stakeholders, Biocon said in a filing to the BSE. Biocon will continue to operate essential pharmaceutical manufacturing in full compliance with government requirements, it added. "Since we are involved in manufacturing of essential drugs, we are assessing the impact of the lockdown on our ability to continue with manufacturing operations of essential pharmaceuticals, biopharmaceuticals and APIs in order to meet our commitments to patients, customers and partners," it added. While supply chain disruptions and impaired mobility due to lockdowns have a direct bearing on the operations, "we are working to minimise disruption to production schedules and supply of drugs...," Biocon said. The current inventory of most of "our raw materials for the company is estimated to last for the next few months," it added. Shares of Biocon were trading at Rs 276.35 per scrip, down 2.33 per cent, on the BSE.

LED backlight market demands fell short of expectations, which caused sliding ASP of LED chips and LED package. This trend has been markedly observed during second half of 2015, when LED chip and package prices sharply plunged to the point that some LED chip and package spec prices are now close to material costs. Many manufacturers have incurred losses as a result. Even though manufacturers in the LED industry are being pressured to lower prices in the short term, in the long run there will be limited room for further LED price cuts. This can be explained by the growing number of manufacturers withdrawing from the market in the near future, as LED prices is close to manufacturing costs and reduce companies’ profitability.

Analysts were unanimous in welcoming RBI's rate cuts, forbearance on loans and liquidity easing measures, saying the economy requires stimuli in the present circumstances. Some of them also said that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) may have to deepen the rate cut if the COVID-19 crisis prolongs.
 The RBI, which advanced a meeting of the rate setting panel by a week, announced a 0.75 per cent cut in its policy rates, infusion of Rs 3.76 lakh crore of liquidity through moves like a cut in cash reserve ratio and also allowed banks to not treat any term loans as NPAs for three months if there is no repayment. “RBI, very correctly so, announced a comprehensive bazooka covering all aspects of the economy by taking measures system-wide both through liquidity, rates and regulatory forbearance (retail as well as for industry) and also targeted measures to manage the corporate bond markets,” Kotak Mahindra Bank's senior economist Upasana Bharadwaj said.
 She said the measures should help in tiding issues which many banks/institutions were fearing and will go a long way in cushioning the dislocations in various markets. The bank expects additional scope for 0.40-0.50 per cent cut depending on the nature of spread of COVID-19, she added.
 Singaporean lender DBS’s economist Radhika Rao said RBI has pulled out all stops with the aggressive rate cut and said the intention seems to be to reduce cost of funds while lowering incremental capital burden on banks. The central bank has also addressed banks’ reticence in buying commercial paper by making it possible to hold them under the hold to maturity portfolio rather than mark to market, which affects their earnings, she said.
 “While India has limited fiscal space, monetary policy continues to do the heavy lifting at a time when growth is at a severe risk in the near term,” SBI Mutual Fund's chief investment officer Navneet Muhnot said. He said we need to explore unconventional measures on fiscal, administrative and regulatory fronts on the lines of lead taken by RBI.
 Consulting firm Deloitte’s partner Himanish Chaudhuri said the announcement is welcome and has allayed a lot of concerns which the industry was having. Industry lobby CII’s director general Chandrajit Banerji welcomed the RBI moves but added that it expects the central bank to extend the repayment moratorium if the crisis prolongs.
 Domestic rating company Acuite’s president Suman Chowdhury said while the rate cut of 75 bps is indeed sharp and goes beyond the market expectations, the extent of the transmission by the banking system will have to be seen. Suyash Choudhary of IDFC AMC said "RBI has now put to rest the concern that it was failing to appreciate the required pivot to emergency conditions," he said.
 Abhimanyu Sofat of IIFL Securities said the Non-performing asset (NPA) relaxation by way moratorium on repayment will be a relief for the industry but the central bank has disappointed Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) and mutual funds by not offering a special window for them. Vinay Pandit of IndiaNivesh said overall a positive for non-banking stocks, though need to wait and watch how this plays out for Banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) companies.
 Amar Ambani of Yes Securities said with these multiple steps, liquidity injected into the system is around USD 50 billion. On banks being allowed to participate in Non-Deliverable Forward (NDF) market, he said this was a long- standing demand and the same will help tide over the currency volatility to some extent.
 “Full marks to the governor for these commendable and decisive steps,” he said. Joseph Thomas of Emkay Wealth Management said the measures have addressed all the fundamental issues in a comprehensive manner.
 On the repayment moratorium, he said this is a direct and targeted approach in the face of an uncertain inflation and growth trajectory. "This scaffolds the positive impact of the fiscal measures and strengthens our response to the adverse economic impact of the pandemic," he said.

Sen. Tony Luetkemeyer, R-Parkville, said he believes companies should take caution showing up at individuals’ homes during a pandemic.
 “Any company right now should be exercising caution and should not be taking advantage of a situation where we’re in the midst of a pandemic,” Luetkemeyer said.
 On Tuesday, March 24, Hibbard said he had got a call from Invenergy saying the company had suspended all scheduled in-person meetings.
 Hibbard said in a statement that he was grateful for that.
 ”So much time was wasted by a lot people just to get this company to do the right thing. It is so very important to have a governor that champions the rural farm families of Missouri, thank you Gov. Parson, “ said Hibbard in a written statement.

It did.
 Miller retired two of the four batters he faced, and that brought Votto up with the tying run at third and two outs. Miller’s pitch count had mushroomed. The decision was not easy, not ideal for the veteran, and yet obvious. I went to hotshot lefty Genesis Cabrera to face Votto. The former MVP tagged a two- out double that flipped the game on the Cardinals and bounced Cabrera from the game. Two batters later, Moustakas cleared the bases with a three-run double off Brebbia. In the eighth, I had lefty Tyler Webb set to face Votto, and Hochman’s No. 2 hitter lashed an RBI single. Each lever I pulled was a trapdoor at my feet.

In the video, apparently shot in north Maharashtra, the policeman can be seen with a cordless mic in hand, asking people stay at home as part of the social distancing to contain spread of coronavirus.
 "Zindagi maut na ban jaye, sambhalo yaaron...(Friends, ensure that life doesn't turn into death)", the cop is seen crooning the song from Aamir Khan- starrer Sarfarosh. The policeman's out of the box thinking to drive home the message of social distancing was lauded by state home minister Anil Deshmukh.
 The NCP minister posted the video of the policeman singing on his Twitter handle and hoped people take notice. "A Maharashtra police constable breaks into a song in a bid to convince people to cooperate and stay indoors ...hope people listen to his musical entreaty!," Deshmukh tweeted.

The NDRF, the specialised force to tackle disasters, is getting battle-ready should its services are required amid rising cases of the deadly COVID 19 that has put the country under an unprecedented lockdown, its Director General S N Pradhan said. Pradhan said personnel of the National Disaster Response Force are also present in all the COVID-19 state control rooms as part of its preparedness.
 We have prepared 84 small core teams per battalion. The force is trying to cover 600 personnel in each battalion with personal protection equipment (PPE)... we have informed the chief secretaries of all the states that we are on standby mode and can be called in as and when required in terms of the protocol, he told PTI in a telephonic interview.
 Our men are deputed in the dedicated control rooms of states so that we are on the same page with the local authority in terms of the information, work and tasking, he added. NDRF has 12 battalions, each consisting of 1,150 personnel.
 Pradhan said Bihar and Tamil Nadu have already sought its help for coronavirus prevention exercise. On Thursday, the Bihar government had asked for two NDRF teams to be on standby in Patna and Munger for support to the local police and medical staff. Tamil Nadu called us to tend to segregation activities at railway stations, he said.
 The force has so far trained nearly 28,000 personnel, including those from the CISF and other forces, and will continue with the routine every day, but in smaller batches to maintain social distancing. Pradhan said the NDRF has been successful in clearing a lot of apprehension of the staff of other forces about the coronavirus safety precautions.
 We have been preparing and training all the outward- facing staff across the landports, airports and seaports for the last one month on how to wear PPEs, especially the gloves and masks and how to handle them, and the basic aspects of social distancing, the NDRF chief said. Pradhan, who assumed charge in January last year, said personnel of the force are trained for medical first response (MFR) and pre-hospital treatment (PHT), and can function as the facilitating arm of states for the frontline health workers.
 We are not in the frontline like doctors or in the secondline like paramedics, but probably feature right after them... NDRF men can be of help at the quarantine centres or in places where there are mass cases, he said. The Odisha-born IPS officer also said it will have enough personnel to respond to any natural disaster that may arise amid the COVID-19 crisis, notwithstanding the nearly 50 per cent of its strength in all readiness for a possible coronavirus call.
 We will work in a collaborative model with the states for example, there will be a local policeman, a local medical professional, then there will be an NDRF personnel so that we can economise the whole exercise and judiciously use our force, Pradhan said..

The functioning of the amalgamated entity of three PSBs -- Punjab National Bank, Oriental Bank of Commerce and United Bank of India that comes into being on April 1-- will be a big challenge in the wake of the ongoing 21-day nationwide lockdown, an official said on Friday. The merger of UBI and OBC into PNB will lead to the creation of the countrys second largest lender after State Bank of India, the official said.Under the given conditions, the effective functioning of the merged entity will be a big challenge. The government has not given any direction so far in this regard, the UBI official told PTI. The legal process of the merger has been completed, he said.OBC and UBI are the transferor banks while PNB is the transferee in this amalgamation process. The boards of UBI and OBC will cease to exist from April 1, 2020, the official said..The effective functioning of the merged entity will be seriously impacted due to the outbreak of COVID-19, which has put all plans into a tailspin, the official said. According to the swap ratio, 1,150 equity shares of PNB are to be exchanged for every 1,000 shares of Oriental Bank of Commerce. As many as 121 equity shares of PNB are to be swapped for every 1,000 shares of the Kolkata-headquartered bank.

Equity benchmark index Sensex erased early sharp gains to close lower by 131 points on Friday, snapping its three-day rising streak as concerns over an impending recession heightened after the RBI said the projected annual growth was at risk due to the COVID-19 outbreak.
 In a bid to support the economy during the pandemic, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das unveiled a slew of measures, including its steepest interest rate cuts in more than 11 years. The repo has been cut by 75 basis points to 4.4% - the lowest in at least 15 years.
 Further, the Reserve Bank reduced the cash reserve ratio (CRR) for all banks by 100 basis points to 3% to release Rs 1.37 lakh crore across the banking system. It also allowed banks to put on hold monthly instalment payments on all term loans for three months.
 After opening significantly higher, the 30-share BSE barometer gave up all the gains to end 131.18 points or 0.44% lower at 29,815.59. It hit a high of 31,126.03 and a low of 29,346.99 in day trade.
 On the other hand, the broad-based NSE Nifty closed 18.80 points, or 0.22%, higher at 8,660.25.
 Bajaj Finance was the biggest loser in the Sensex pack, tanking up to 8%, followed by Hero MotoCorp, IndusInd Bank, Maruti and HCL Tech.
 Axis Bank, ITC, NTPC and M&M were among the top gainers.
 Despite massive rate cuts, domestic market turned negative on concerns over the annual economic growth amid rising uncertainty over the COVID-19 pandemic, traders said.
 Announcing the decisions of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), RBI Governor Das said that no projection for growth and inflation was being given in view of the uncertainty created by outbreak of the deadly virus.
 He further said that the growth projection of 4.7% for the fourth quarter of 2019-20 and 5% for the whole fiscal was at risk.
 Jimeet Modi, Founder and CEO, Samco Securities said, In such uncertain times, instead of fresh funds entities want to save their skin, RBI’s relaxation of only 3 months instead of 6 months for moratorium on interest on loans and working capital has disappointed many.
 He added that there is no doubt that the RBI is playing every card in its pocket to prevent a crisis-like situation by giving banks the ability to lend more, but as such no direct helping hand has been given to ailing industries as of now.
 Meanwhile globally, bourses in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Seoul ended higher, while benchmarks in Europe were trading in the red.
 International oil benchmark Brent crude fell 2.20% to USD 25.76 per barrel in futures trade.
 On the currency front, the rupee depreciated marginally to 75.20 against the US dollar in intra-day trade.
 The death toll due to COVID-19 rose to 17 in the country on Friday and the number of coronavirus cases climbed to 724, according to the Health Ministry.
 The number of deaths around the world linked to the new coronavirus has crossed over 24,000.

Spending time with preppers has changed Garrett. He recently spent two months driving more than 11,000 miles across Australia in a Jeep Wrangler bug-out vehicle with his partner, Amanda, imagining the apocalypse. And now he’s ready to leave at a moment’s notice. “I always reverse my car into the garage,” he says. And instead of keeping his Inch bag under the bed, he has it – tent, basic supplies, stove, sleeping bag – stowed in the boot for a quick getaway. “Cities are not the place to be in extremis. When the shit goes down, better to be in Idaho.” He cites the French Marxist Paul Virilio, who worried that as space and distance were compressed by speed and connectivity, we would become more vulnerable to disaster. “In other words, progress and disaster go hand in hand,” Garrett explains.

Daily wage labourers in the capital city's largest wholesale market, Sadar Bazar, are facing tough times as there is no work due to the nationwide lockdown in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. However, some good samaritans of the area have come to their rescue. The people and shopkeepers who own houses in the market area are now providing meals to these labourers.
 "After the lockdown it was seen that scores of men who are daily wage labourers were roaming in the streets for food. After taking stock of the situation, we spoke to the shopkeepers and the residents and requested them to provide the labourers food. All of them are now getting food," said Ajay Kumar, Delhi Police Head Constable. Dinesh Sharma, a resident, said, " We have made arrangements for their food. They will be fed till the lockdown is over."
 Also, the Delhi government has arranged lunch and dinner for the needy in 325 schools in Delhi, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Friday amid reports of people going hungry during the ongoing lockdown. From Saturday, arrangements will be put in place to feed about four lakh people daily at different centres across Delhi, he said while addressing the media.
 "We have made arrangements to provide lunch and dinner in 325 schools. Around 500 people will be provided food in all these schools. So far, we were providing food to 20,000 people daily, the number will now increase to around 2,00,000 from today." He also said, "from tomorrow, we'll be providing food to 4,00,000 people daily".

The leadership vacuum in the Oval Office is so palpable, it has forced America to look elsewhere to fill the void. Governors around the country, with Gov.

The functioning of the amalgamated entity of three PSBs -- Punjab National Bank, Oriental Bank of Commerce and United Bank of India that comes into being on April 1-- will be a "big challenge" in the wake of the ongoing 21-day nationwide lockdown, an official said on Friday. The merger of UBI and OBC into PNB will lead to the creation of the country's second largest lender after State Bank of India, the official said.
 "Under the given conditions, the effective functioning of the merged entity will be a big challenge. The government has not given any direction so far in this regard," the UBI official told PTI. The legal process of the merger has been completed, he said.
 OBC and UBI are the transferor banks while PNB is the transferee in this amalgamation process. The boards of UBI and OBC will cease to exist from April 1, 2020, the official said..
 "The effective functioning of the merged entity will be seriously impacted due to the outbreak of COVID-19, which has put all plans into a tailspin," the official said. According to the swap ratio, 1,150 equity shares of PNB are to be exchanged for every 1,000 shares of Oriental Bank of Commerce. As many as 121 equity shares of PNB are to be swapped for every 1,000 shares of the Kolkata-headquartered bank.

Kennis’ staff are also working to protect themselves, with limited workplace contact. Managers are alternating hours and working from home when possible.
 “The dispatch center’s kind-of quarantined — if you’re not a dispatcher, you don’t go back there,” Kennis said.
 Drivers uncomfortable with their task and potential for exposure have been furloughed so they can apply for unemployment, he added. It has worked out well with reduced ridership numbers.
 Bus loads have been limited to 2-3 passengers at once, and drivers are wiping down seats and railings whenever they find a minute, Kennis said.
 Vehicles are also fogged daily for a more thorough disinfecting.
 Recently, Kennis and his staff have offered storage space for a Benzie County mask collection movement he says is still in the works.
 The still-in-planning project would help coordinate mask donations, with local hospitals, clinics and nursing homes able to request masks from Benzie Bus' storage and have a shipment delivered to their doors.
 "If a nursing home says they need 10 masks for today, our buses can freely deliver them and get them over there right away," Kennis said Thursday. "We're doing whatever we can do."
 For BATA, further precautions take the form of limited Dial-A-Ride services. Most riders for those trips are screened, Linguar said, to ensure they’re traveling for essential needs only.
 “We are encouraging drivers to monitor their ridership,” Linguar said. “We have signs on all our vehicles encouraging riders to space themselves, if possible.”
 Still, no passenger limits are being enforced, Linguar said.
 Further cuts could come as riders dwindle, but for now, each is doing what they can to serve those in need.
 “We’re making people happy,” Kennis said.

He headed out on loan in January alongside Marcus Browne, the thinking being for the pair to benefit from regular football and return in the summer prepared to give it another go, with the added nous and experience of now knowing what the Championship is about.
 For Browne, things have worked out well, he's flying at Oxford.
 For Bola, back at Blackpool, less so. Things started out promisingly enough, until a managerial change stopped him in his tracks, a setback he could have done without in a frustrating season.
 "It's been a bit of a mixed bag, truth be told," Matt Scrafton, football writer for the Blackpool Gazette tells Teesside Live.
 "He was thrown straight into the side, at wing-back rather than full-back, and showed glimpses of the Bola we saw in tangerine last season. In his first two or three games, he looked a threat going forwards although he was getting caught out defensively a bit too often. A lot of that was down to the shape and formation Simon Grayson was adopting at the time, which left him isolated and exposed.
 "A month after rejoining the club, Bola found himself out of the team after Grayson was sacked, missing Blackpool's last six games (and sometimes not even making the bench).
 "Bola was at fault for two of the three goals Blackpool conceded in the 3-2 defeat at home to Gillingham in February, the game that proved to be Grayson's final game as manager - he was sacked the following day.
 "David Dunn came in as caretaker and tweaked a few things, which saw Bola miss out. The Seasiders already had two capable left-backs in James Husband (another former Middlesbrough player) and Calum Macdonald prior to Bola's return, and they were favoured to Bola with Dunn playing a more balanced 3-5-2 system with Husband on the left of the back three and Macdonald as wing-back.
 "Once football resumes, he'll have to fight his way past those two and, as it stood before the suspension, he found himself third in the pecking order with no guarantee of game time."

So let's say North Bay decides it's too risky. Niagara is next up. They drafted his brother last year. Remember how close the pair apparently is. That might be enough to convince the Fantillis to change their minds and come home to play together in the OHL. The IceDogs could therefore take a flyer on him.

Hazardous chemicals are present in close proximity in different social orders and could represent a risk if not taken care of precisely. The worldwide hazardous chemicals packaging market is backed by packaging innovation to ensure effective transport of chemical items. Producers of chemicals packaging work to provide different solutions for hazardous chemicals, for example, drums, IBCs, canisters and so forth. Hazardous chemical packaging eliminates harm and increases the time span of usability of the items stored during transportation. Besides, hazardous chemical packaging arrangements offer increased security to the items. The danger of spillage, blast and consumption is greatly diminished. As a result of this, the demand for rotomolded containers is quite high in the chemicals packaging industry owing to its significant properties and its resistance to any unwanted transportation hazards. The sturdiness of rotomolded containers is expected to bode well for the global market in the long run.
