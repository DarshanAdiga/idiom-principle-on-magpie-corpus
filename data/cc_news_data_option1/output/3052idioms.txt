On Thursday, crews at the SpaceX development facility in Boca Chica completed a successful static fire of the prototype's raptor engine, clearing the path for a hop attempt.
 "Starship SN5 just completed full duration static fire. 150m hop soon," Musk said on Twitter.
 Musk said on Twitter last month that SN5 "will attempt to fly later this week," but Hurricane Hanna had other plans, forcing SpaceX to batten down the hatches at Boca Chica and postpone all major tests.
 It's been a struggle to get the SN series of prototypes off the ground.

While the company filed a one-year plan, Bruckner said it hopes to negotiate an agreement with the PSC staff, customer advocates and other stakeholders that would spread the increases over three years. Such an agreement could reduce the first-year price impacts by more than half, he said.
 “We know we are not operating in a business-as-usual climate,” Bruckner said. “We will do everything we can to work with PSC staff and other stakeholders to reach a multi-year settlement that maintains affordability, mitigates bill impacts and supports New York’s economic recovery.”
 He said rate increases are necessary to “cover the costs of providing service and we must remain financially healthy to attract the necessary capital to finance our operations, which will lower costs for customers in the long run.”
 The rate increases would only impact energy delivery charges, not supply charges, on customer bills. National Grid buys electricity and natural gas from generators and suppliers and delivers them over its network to 1.6 million electricity customers and 600,000 gas customers across its Upstate New York service territory. Supply prices are set by the market, not National Grid.
 National Grid said it plans to propose in a separate filing up to $50 million in “Covid-19 relief” to support the company’s “most economically vulnerable residential customers as well as businesses that are struggling because of the financial impact of the pandemic.” It said it would work with the PSC staff and others to determine how best to allocate the assistance.
 The company said it plans to make the additional customer assistance part of a separate filing so it can be considered and implemented more quickly than the required 11-month rate proceeding process.
 “We know our customers continue to struggle during this pandemic and this is a way for us to provide some near-term relief,” Bruckner said.

She questions everyone after this. Things happened to her, and she didn’t have a choice or a say-so with what happened with her body, so I think that changes her as, well. We’re used to seeing Kiesha free and grounded and taking ownership over all parts of her, and she is definitely broken after this. It’s a whole different world for Kiesha.

"Lockdowns do not prevent infection in the future -- they just don't. It comes back, many times. It comes back," he said.
 Earlier on Monday, Dr. Fauci, the nation's leading infectious disease expert who's advising Trump, said certain US states that are experiencing rising infection rates and case surges should consider reimposing at least partial shutdowns.
 Fauci told the Journal of the American Medical Association on Monday that some states outside of the South and West are seeing an "insidious increase" in the percent of positive COVID-19 tests -- an early warning sign that these places could soon see uncontrolled surges in the virus. Experts say these states include Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, and Tennessee.
 "You may need to pause, you may need to drop back a little bit. I don't think you necessarily have to revert to go all the way back to reclosing," Fauci told JAMA.

President Donald Trump on Monday claimed that the lockdowns implemented during the coronavirus pandemic haven't reduced future infections and "inflict more harm" than they prevent -- contradicting Dr. Anthony Fauci.
 "It's important for all Americans to recognize that a permanent lockdown is not a viable path toward producing the result that you want," Trump said during his coronavirus-focused press briefing, adding that new lockdowns would "ultimately inflict more harm than it would prevent."
 Overwhelming evidence has shown that lockdowns around the country and the world have helped the spread of COVID-19.
 Trump went on to argue that lockdowns, which involve shuttering non-essential businesses and closing schools, are designed to "buy time" for states and localities to build hospital capacity, research the virus, and develop treatments, but aren't effective in preventing future outbreaks.

A Palo Alto high school student has developed a new, and melodic, way for parents to keep fidgety and stir-crazy kids occupied during quarantine.
 Inspired by a successful songwriting class she hosted with her local elementary school (as well as living with her restless and frustrated 10-year- old sister), Julia Segal, 17, came up with a creative, musical solution to fill the time.
 Her creation, dubbed Quarantunes, organizes musically talented teens who are willing to teach free, online music lessons in exchange for optional donations to medical efforts fighting the spread of the coronavirus.
 Initially, Segal envisioned recruiting friends and classmates to become teachers for a local organization that mainly catered to the Palo Alto area, but she quickly realized that "there are kids everywhere in the country that are looking for ways to be occupied."
 Propelled by word of mouth, newspaper coverage and social media, Bay Area teens informed friends living in other parts of the country about Quarantunes, and the organization's rapid growth quickly exceeded Segal's expectations.
 "I thought there was an extent to which it could grow organically," she said, "(but) people from other countries (joined)," including teens from India, Russia and Spain.
 Since its founding in early April, Quarantunes has more than 130 teachers who collectively offer more than 5,000 lessons to 500 students. And, perhaps even more impressive, the organization has raised more than $25,000 in donations, all of which benefit the CDC Foundation.
 The response from teachers and students alike has been overwhelmingly positive. Quarantunes has provided an opportunity for teachers to give back to their community and has allowed children to become invested in learning music, rather than being glued to computer games and Netflix.
 "This whole experience has been fulfilling and lifesaving because I now have time to do the things I need to for work and my kids are occupied," said Margarita Golod, a Bay Area resident whose two children take lessons from Quarantunes teachers. "It's been good for my kids to see this example of young adults who are positively influencing other children and families."
 Teenagers who volunteer their time are happy to share their love of music and express gratitude for an immensely rewarding experience. For piano teacher Tyler Liu, an incoming University of California, Berkeley freshman, "it's a great opportunity to give back to the community and make kids feel happy about checking out music."
 Madelynn Hardke, a voice teacher from Oakland, added that "even if you aren't able to be there in person, just being able to sing with somebody makes kids so excited about learning music."
 Beyond helping children grow their passion for music, teachers are developing a newfound appreciation for their own musical experiences and the teachers that helped them.
 "You take for granted how much you've learned," said Liu. "When you teach it, you have to find new ways to express that."
 To be sure, getting Quarantunes up and running required hard work, and it hasn't all been smooth sailing. Early on the biggest challenge, Segal said, was not having a system in place. Much of the work, including scheduling and texting teachers for headshots, was done manually by Segal and Lisa Kopelnik, the organization's chief communications officer.
 "We were the marketing team, the communications team, everything all in one," said Kopelnik. "Julia and I would wake up at 7 (a.m.) and go to bed at 11 (p.m.). The first couple weeks were crazy; we were emailing hundreds of schools, music programs and making sure all the lessons were running smoothly."
 Chief Operating Officer Naama Bejerano, who will be attending Stanford University this fall, is responsible for the organization's logistics. She said it took time to establish smooth communication among board members and teachers, especially as Quarantunes grew beyond the Bay Area.
 "Communicating with people when they live all over, teach different things and have different availabilities was initially a challenge," recalled Bejerano. "That wasn't something we thought of at the beginning." And many of the problems that arose were not the sort of things that the high school students running Quarantunes had encountered before.
 "One teacher quit without any notice," Segal said, "so we had to reassign 20 students, but there were not enough teachers.
 "There had been a lot of points where we had to stop and think how to prevent this situation from occurring (again)," said Segal. "Each of the obstacles served an important purpose as learning experiences that were necessary to running an organization."
 Over time, systems were put in place to keep things running smoothly. Quarantunes adopted a policy that requires teachers to provide two weeks' notice before quitting, while an online schedule app, called Picktime, eliminated the need for manual scheduling.
 Since establishing a strong foundation, however, the focus has shifted towards ensuring accessibility for all students, as well as scaling the organization to become a truly national or, perhaps, international platform.
 "For me the most important part was to ensure that all students have equitable access, regardless of financial barriers or barriers in terms of disability," Kopelnik said.
 "A lot of times music lessons tend to be accessible only if you have the money," added Bejerano. "By breaking down those barriers, making pay optional and opening it up to all students, Quarantunes is able to spread music in a time like this."
 Allison Briscoe-Smith, an Oakland-based psychiatrist whose daughter takes songwriting and singing lessons with Quarantunes, praised the platform's accessibility as a "mini revolution of providing high-quality training and instruction to kids who might not get it."
 Another key factor in Quarantune's accessibility is its instrument donation program, which delivers musical instruments to students' homes if they meet financial requirements and live within an hour of Menlo Park. Several Bay Area music stores have also partnered with Quarantunes to donate instruments for free; while teachers and students are also given the option of donating old instruments.
 And furthering its goal for every child to have access to the platform, Quarantunes also trains teachers to work with children with different abilities, with instruction by an expert in special education.
 What began as an idea shared between friends has blossomed into a full-fledged organization that caters to children around the world. Currently, Quarantunes is scrambling to find enough teachers for its influx of students, but the hope is to serve thousands, and possibly hundreds of thousands, of young people interested in music.
 Quarantunes currently offers a range of lessons including piano, strings, wind and brass, as well as songwriting composition. And thanks to overwhelming interest, the organization started offering lessons in other art forms such as drawing and painting. But the group's biggest lesson goes beyond any specific instruction.
 Quarantunes proves "that young people are able to address big problems," said Briscoe-Smith. "Every kid involved is an activist working to solve this big problem about COVID-19."

Local teachers' unions are presumably displeased, as many teachers don't want to be back in the classroom … and also don't want to do a full day of virtual learning, which raises the question of what they're being paid for. Parents should be happier with Hogan's move, as the temporary closure of private schools in Montgomery County reportedly drew "swift blowback" from moms and dads. The polling among parents nationally is on Hogan's side of the great reopening debate -- sort of. Although relatively few want full-time classroom instruction this fall, many others are open to a hybrid system of classroom learning and virtual learning. Add 'em up and that's 72 percent who want kids in class at least part-time. One ER doctor who has children in private school in Montgomery County cheered Hogan's decision, telling WaPo, "Schools had made significant financial investments, and had medical advisory boards and pages and pages of plans." Why not give them a chance to put those plans into practice and see if they can make a go of this? That's the Hogan view.

First off, it does not matter who is harmfully breaking the law. The harm must be legally stopped, and too many of our leaders just don’t get it. They say less racism is a good cause and they are right, but it does not follow that a good cause means anything goes.
 They will tell you that peaceful protest is part of what America is, and they are right, but it is absurdity surrounded by deception to maintain that what we have had is just peaceful protest or that white supremacists are mostly to blame.
 Even if the Umbrella Man started what happened in Minneapolis, it was then the protesters who sprang into action. And if it is mostly white supremacists committing evil at an event, then the peaceful protesters should depart. They should protest elsewhere. They should avoid anything damaging other lives. They should quit cheering the people who hate them.
 They do seem to be doing a decent job of identifying some of the troublemakers as antifa or KKK or what have you. Just from watching TV, I have no doubt many of the unruly protesters, maybe even a majority, are white, but I also suspect some are upper-middle-class young people subscribing to leftism.
 I have seen all kinds of articles defending peaceful protest, and so do I, but then so many of those articles confuse “peaceful” with arson, theft and vandalism. What they do is make excuses and tell you how horrible police are and how insistent racism is. They neglect progress and the fact that police debasement, hindrance and the wrong kind of reform can lead to the kind of Black-on-Black criminality right now killing Black children in Chicago.
 To be sure, I understand the fear of public officials that a policeman could possibly shoot a demonstrator, but leftists refuse to listen to research at odds with their claims about racist police shootings or about calamitous consequences of unleashed criminality in Black neighborhoods or about cultural issues fostering much of what we are seeing.

Efforts to solve these problems have been few and far between as well as severely lacking. In 1934, after discovering that the United States was educating their students to suppress their “Indianness,” indigenous people were given control of their own education – but they received no resources to guarantee the quality of that education, leading to an educational disparity we still see today. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 helped mitigate suppression of the Native American vote, but indigenous communities still face barriers to voting, and the Supreme Court’s ruling in Shelby County v. Holder minimized the positive effects of the Voting Rights Act. Time and time again, efforts to repair the damage done to Native Americans has resulted in broken promises and disappointment. COVID-19 has shined a light on the disparities between indigenous communities and the rest of the nation by damaging both the health and economies of reservations. Now is the time to address those disparities.

Pixel 4A's performance and battery
 The Pixel 4A features a Snapdragon 730G chipset and 6GB of RAM. On benchmark tests the Pixel 4A consistently outperformed the Galaxy A51. But, as expected, it fell behind the Pixel 4 flagship, which has a superior Snapdragon 855 processor. The iPhone SE, with its proprietary A13 Bionic processor from Apple, beat all the phones comfortably.
 Anecdotally, the phone works quickly with most tasks. Unlocking the screen with my fingerprint, launching Assistant and opening apps went off without a hitch. But the Pixel 4A isn't the smoothest phone I handled. After I downloaded Call of Duty and PUBG, I had to restart the phone because both apps stalled while loading. And every once in a while, say, an app would unexpectedly quit or I had to relaunch the camera because the on-screen shutter button wouldn't register. Overall though, the phone works reliably, and after restarting I was able to play both of the aforementioned games without any further issues.
