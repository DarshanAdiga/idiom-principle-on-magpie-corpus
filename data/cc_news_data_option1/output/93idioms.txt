Old soldiers with grandchildren of military age should worry. This non- partisan old warrior understands war from several perspectives.
   
 As a war refugee of the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1944, he appreciates its broad and deadly consequences. As an infantry paratrooper and elite ranger who fought in Vietnam in his 20s, he understands the high price the few armed and exposed citizens must bear for the many. As a troop commander and teacher of tactics and strategy during the Cold War in his 30s, 40s and 50s, he understands the costs of a just and advantageous peace.
   
 There are some hard facts to face and questions to ask about how and why this country seems to be on the road to war.
   
 The president recently authorized the assassination of Gen. Qasem Soleimani, an implacable foe of America among the Iranian leadership. The officials of the administration, and its supporters, are justifying this act because our intelligence services predicted an imminent attack by people under his command.
   
 Going to war requires trust and unity. Why was this intelligence a credible call to action now, when former warnings by our unified intelligence agencies were not believed? Or did this intelligence, and the assassination, provide a useful diversion from the president's impeachment?
   
 Assuming that the intelligence of this unspecified planned attack is valid, will the assassination of their commander stop it, and, if so, will it deter future attacks by his followers? Or will it only provide upward mobility to one of his many potential successors and also provoke an uncontrollable and unpredictable escalation of violence?
   
 Assassinating a high official of a real country, a member of the United Nations, is an escalation that invites in-kind reprisals. Representatives of governments will be assassinated more often, as will business leaders. Alliances will be more difficult to form, yet, to fight Iran effectively, our need of them will be greater than ever.
   
 If violence between America and Iran escalates in this way, as is likely, what is our definition of "victory" and how will it be attained? What is the cause- and-effect hypothesis in the minds of President Donald Trump and his war council that will overturn a strategically intolerable status quo and enforce a new and desirable one?
   
 Since the First Gulf War, our wars have tended to be endless. Both parties, when in power, have recently been poor architects of "theories of victory." We have been better at beginning wars than ending them victoriously.
   
 Winning wars against determined enemies will always require eliminating the enemy's option to decide how and when the war ends. The assassination of Gen. Soleimani will surely influence the will and decisions of enemy political leaders, but in unpredictable ways.
   
 The same goes for the devastating attacks against the 52 culturally iconic targets President Trump is preparing to launch next. Let's be reminded of how Americans reacted to the attack on the twin iconic towers in New York City! The question is: Can the president's firepower defeat the enemy leadership's power to resist the political war aims the administration means to impose?
   
 In the future, as in the past, winning will often require long campaigns of large-scale operational ground maneuver from distant bases by very large numbers of American and allied soldiers and marines on the ground. Any happy talk about replacing the function of boots on the ground with drones, missiles and bombers is based on false premises. In fact, the strategic problem will usually make any other approach impractical.
   
 A realistic rule of thumb for the number of troops required to enforce peace terms on Iran would be 20 American or allied troops for every 1,000 of the population. Iran has about 80 million people. That requires a stability operations force of at least 1.6 million for a number of years.
   
 Anyone who thinks the American and allied people would support that kind of burden is crazy. Anyone who wants to bring the Iranian government down by firepower, cyber-power and info-power with a ground contingent sized to win public support is equally crazy.
   
 This is no time to be complacent about the decision-making in Washington. Those who see the assassination of Gen. Soleimani as a good step are either blindly loyal or immune to the costs and imprecisions of war. They have taken us onto a road to war with an unworkable theory of victory.

One of the premiere positional matchups in Monday's national championship game between Clemson and LSU will play out in the Clemson secondary and go a long way towards deciding the winner in New Orleans.
   
 LSU features a deep, talented and diverse crew of pass catchers, in addition to multi-faceted running back Clyde Edwards-Helaire, snagging throws from by far the country's most accurate quarterback in Heisman Trophy winner Joe Burrow.
   
 The Tigers have earned every last bit of the massive hype surrounding their elite passing attack and Clemson defensive backs had no trouble giving that unit their due.
   
 "No, they've got respect," safety Tanner Muse said when asked if he was sick of hearing about the greatness of LSU's offense. "I think they've earned it and you've got the two best teams, so why wouldn't you want to talk about them."
          Gear up for the playoffs! Clemson football stories straight to your inbox: Sign up for our Clemson Tigers newsletter        
 Muse added, "A lot of people thought the Ohio State offense was the best as well and we did a great job of preparing for them. Then Alabama last year, everybody thought that was the best team of the decade so it will be good to see how we stack up against the best."
   
 It's been a reversal of fortune offensively from LSU's past when the team won more with defense and a strong ground game. The arrival of 30-year-old Joe Brady as the team's passing game coordinator and wide-receivers coach after he'd previously spent time with the Saints alongside quarterback Drew Brees and coach Sean Payton was a difference-maker.
   
 The new approach had the perfect roster to pull off the production in a receiving corps that's not just a main go-to guy with a solid supporting cast but instead of bevy of stars each capable of taking over a game with huge plays. Five different Tigers (three wide-outs) have at least 42 receptions and four of them (minus Edwards-Helaire's 50 catches for 399 yards) have topped 530 yards.
   
 Ja'Marr Chase, the Biletnikoff Award winner as the nation's best receiver, and Justin Jefferson both established a new SEC record and led the country with 18 touchdown receptions. Chase caught 75 passes for 1,559 yards (second nationally) with Jefferson's 102 catches for 1,434 yards both third in the country. Terrace Marshall Jr. has 43 catches for 625 yards and 12 touchdowns despite missing three games due to injury. He's expected to be okay for Monday after injuring his shoulder in the Peach Bowl win over Oklahoma. The past two games (with the SEC Championship over Georgia) he's caught 11 balls for 169 yards and four touchdowns.
   
 Rounding out that platoon is 6-foot-3, 250-pound tight end Thaddeus Moss, son of NFL Hall-of-Fame receiver Randy Moss, and his 42 catches for 534 yards despite also missing three games. Moss had his best game of the year in the semifinals with four catches for 99 yards and a touchdown. Jefferson caught 14 passes for 227 yards and four of Burrow's seven touchdown throws in that game.
   
 Burrow said of his team's approach, "It's getting five yards on a route every play and making them defend every single person. Anybody can get the ball on any play. We're not designing plays to go to this one guy. We have progression reads that everyone can get the ball on, so you have to be on your toes as a defense and really understand who has each individual player, otherwise we'll beat you, or I'll find a guy, and that's what makes it so difficult to defend."
      
 It's going to be a battle of the two best units statistically with Clemson ranked tops in scoring defense, passing defense and is second in total defense while LSU is first in scoring, total offense and completion rate and second in passing yardage and efficiency. Burrow leads the country with an amazing 77.6 completion rate and his 55 touchdown throws are seven more than the nearest quarterback.
   
 "They do great job of just manipulating the defense making them look at one thing and then hitting them at another spot so we just have to be ready for their tendencies and what they have been good at," Muse said. "They understand concepts and man to man and zone stuff and work their way around that and then Burrow obviously knows everything so he slices and dices people up."

 The accusations against Weinstein came to light in October 2017 after two major news outlets, nearly simultaneously, printed stories about his many years of crimes against scores of young women who came into his sphere of influence looking to make it in the film industry, in front of the camera as well as behind the scenes. The list of his victims includes A-list or near A-list actresses, like Angelina Jolie and Gweneth Paltrow and Annabella Sciorra, Roseanna Arquette and Rose McGowen; who-knows-how-many aspiring actresses who suffered his “attentions” and either soldiered on in their lives or in the business or they chucked their Hollywood dreams all-together after that; as well as the untold number of industry workers who never set foot in front of a camera, the office workers, writers and production assistants, who suffered the lashes of his misogyny in order to keep their livelihoods.
 The stories are all too similar: Pretty young things, called upon to attend the man they see as being able to influence their careers, who gets them alone, makes unacceptable sexual suggestions, then gets naked and tries to force his will on them. Afterwards, he threatens them, threatens their jobs, threatens to ruin their lives and careers with his well-paid cadre of lawyers, if they tell on him.

Russian President Vladimir Putin likes to put the hype in his hypersonic glide vehicle, named Avangard. In 2018, he said it was like a "meteorite"and a "fireball," and he declared last month that it is "invulnerable to intercept." Russia has deployed the first of these weapons atop two SS-19 intercontinental ballistic missiles. No one should doubt this technology is advancing, but that should not distract the United States and Russia from negotiating limits on existing nuclear-armed, continent-spanning missiles. They are also fast and dangerous.
   
 Hypersonic weapons can go faster than five times the speed of sound, which comes to nearly 4,000 miles per hour. Russia's military says Avangard can zoom at 27 times the speed of sound, or over 20,000 miles per hour. Such speed makes any weapon hard to stop, but Russia also claims that Avangard is highly maneuverable as it approaches a target, making it especially difficult to intercept by potential missile defense systems, if they are ever built. Right now, the United States has deployed missile defense interceptors in California and Alaska that have only limited capabilities, with no ability to stop Russian weapons.
   
 China and the United States are also investing in hypersonic weapons research, and the technology is one of several -- like cyber and satellite weapons -- changing the face of warfare. Other sorts of hypersonic weapons, such as air- launched cruise missiles, are in the works.
   
 However, hypersonic glide vehicles such as Avangard are not some magical advance. The Russian ballistic missiles upon which the Avangard is hoisted also fly through space at hypersonic speeds. So do U.S. missiles; both the U.S. Minuteman III and the Trident II submarine-launched missile reach about 24 times the speed of sound. While an ICBM usually releases a reentry vehicle that arcs through space toward the target, the Avangard would eject from the launcher and dive into the atmosphere, flying low and zigzagging to avoid interception. Russia says the new glide vehicle is capable of carrying a nuclear as well as conventional warhead.
   
 For those worried about warp-speed war, it would be well to seize today's opportunities to reduce the dangers. The ICBMs on duty today in Russia and the United States can reach their targets in about 30 minutes. Russia has offered to work expeditiously to zigzag by five years the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty limiting these weapons, including Avangard. The treaty, signed in 2010, expires a little more than a year from now. A five-year extension is a concrete move the Trump administration could take to prevent the expansion of these missile arsenals. Another step to reduce the danger of a miscalculation would be to find a way -- bilaterally with Russia -- to take the missiles in both nations off launch-ready alert, a Cold War anachronism that remains in place.
   
 The future of weapons looks frightening. But so does the present -- and we should deal with it.

"What did you say?" said my husband. "You think I need to get my meerkat net?"      "No. I said, 'I think you need to get your hearing checked!'" I sighed.      "My hearing is fine," he argued. "You were mumbling."      I shook my head. I am not a mumbler. Nor am I a soft-talker or a dog- whisperer. If anything, I'm typically whisper-challenged ... which is why I knew the issue was my husband, not me.      "Just go to the audiologist," I said.      "Why do I need an archeologist," he wondered.      I just stared at him and then left the room, muttering under my breath. Now if he didn't hear me at least there was good reason.      I, myself, had recently been diagnosed with an issue called Hidden Hearing Loss, which is really just a problem hearing conversation in a crowded room. On a side note, I also suffered from Silent Reflux and Phantom Knee Pain, so apparently, all my problems were secret ones. My husband, however, had a hard time hearing me clearly all the time. It was pretty obvious, at least to me, that there was nothing phantom about his hearing issues, although he may have had some not-so-hidden denial about it.      "I hear everything I need to hear," he said      "So, you have Selective Hearing Loss," I said.      "I dunno. Maybe," he replied.      "Which means you have elected not to hear me," I said.      He shrugged. "I probably can't hear my mother, either."      Eventually he went to get his hearing checked just to prove me wrong, and was surprised when the audiologist gave him her diagnosis.      "You have 'Spousal Hearing Loss,'" she said confidently.      "What does that mean?" we asked.      "You are tuning out the frequencies of your wife's speech," she said to my husband.      "Just me?" I wondered.      "Maybe his mother, too," she said. Clearly, she'd been around the block a few times with this topic.      "So, this is really a thing?" I asked her.      "Not officially," she replied. "But I do see a lot of it."   When we got home, I wondered if my husband would be able to hear me if I spoke an octave higher or lower. I decided to try out some different frequencies when talking to him to see if my theory worked. I am typically an alto so I had a wide range of other vocal ranges I could try.      "What do you want to do about dinner?" I sang in my highest operatic soprano. My husband was in the next room, so I thought it was a good test of our theory. I wasn't sure if he would hear me, but there was a good chance I might get a female solo in the next Met performance of La Traviata. At the very least, I knew at that pitch the dog could hear me.      "Yeah, I think you look a little thinner," he replied when he walked into the kitchen.      So, clearly going an octave higher didn't help.      "How about some fish," I asked, dropping my voice down to a tenor.      "Yes, honey," he said, coming behind me and wrapping his arms around my waist. "You are definitely a dish."      I smiled. Maybe this hearing loss issue wasn't such a bad thing.

This is a bittersweet one to write. I started 2019 wanting to end my life after struggling with an unexpected & heartbreaking complex PTSD diagnosis. It’s a painful thing to share here, but it’s also quite an empowering one. Because instead of following through with my life-ending intentions brought on by chronic despair & shame, I instead ended 2019 by receiving and cultivating lifesaving purpose & community. To now know what it truly feels like to be on both ends of the mental health spectrum has changed my world forever. My empathy & compassion for myself and others has exponentially increased. I’ve found lifelong friends and discovered who is undoubtedly in my corner. I’ve learned how to ask for real help and stop pretending I’m okay when I’m really not. I’ve put my mental health first, even if it has made others around me uncomfortable - including myself. I share my story in the hopes that if even a single person reading this has struggled at times with suicidal thoughts or intentions, they can know that they are never alone. Life can be as challenging as it is magical. And sometimes hitting a rock bottom moment is the very thing you need to discover exactly who you are when you aren’t so concerned about how the world sees you. I have unearthed the deepest, most authentic version of myself that has existed so far, and I now assuredly know that my inherent worth as a human being can never be achieved or earned - and it can most definitely never be taken away. It has existed inside of me from the very beginning, and it will continue to exist for the rest of my days. I’m humbled & honored to continue getting to know myself as I recover & heal. I’m grateful beyond belief for every single person who has allowed me to trust them with my struggle, to all of those who never minimized or criticized my mental health challenges, and to the counselors, medical professionals, coaches, & loved ones who have patiently held my hand in 2019 through my darkest of moments. I am here. I am alive. And I am just getting started. 🦋🌈

 Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao announced the proposed guidelines in a speech at the CES gadget show in Las Vegas, saying in prepared remarks that “AV 4.0” will ensure U.S. leadership in developing new technologies.
 But the guidelines will likely fall short of expectations of auto safety advocates and the National Transportation Safety Board. In November, the NTSB, which investigates crashes and makes safety recommendations, condemned a lack of state and federal regulation for testing autonomous vehicles.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Natural Resources Conservation Service and the town of Walpole are co-sponsoring two public scoping meetings to discuss the proposed Allen Site Dam rehabilitation project in Walpole.
 The meetings will be held Jan. 14 in room 126 at the Walpole Town Hall, 135 School St., Walpole. An afternoon meeting will be held at 3 p.m. for agencies, organizations and watershed associations, but it is also open to the public. An evening meeting will be held at 6:30 p.m. for the general public.
 Staff from the federal and local agencies, along with their consultants, will provide information on the dam rehabilitation program and planning activities to-date for Allen Site Dam. They will also describe rehabilitation alternatives being considered for this floodwater retarding structure, answer questions, address concerns and seek public input about the planned rehabilitation work.
 The Allen Site Dam is a multi-purpose flood control and recreation structure located in the Diamond Brook Watershed in Walpole, which offers flood protection to residents and businesses located downstream. Local sponsors, NRCS staff, and their consultants are developing a plan to rehabilitate this structure to meet current dam safety regulations and design standards. Alternatives being considered include decommissioning or dam removal, structural rehabilitation, nonstructural measures and no action.
 Planning is scheduled to be completed by Dec. 31. Federal funding has been received to assist the local sponsors in developing the plan but has not yet been secured for the design or construction of this project.
 NRCS provides reasonable accommodations to enable all persons with disabilities to participate in agency programs and activities.
 For special accommodations or information on the meeting, contact Jim Lyons, civil engineer, NRCS, at 774-345-7027 or Jim.Lyons@usda.gov.

Dave Linger, president of the BID’s Board of Directors, said Palmieri served the organization well, noting he has “strong leadership skills” and is a “self-starter.” Linger said Palmieri has an ease with people that allowed him to work with the all-volunteer BID board, the downtown property owners, and BID’s partner organizations, including the city.
 He noted that the executive director is responsible for oversight of the downtown business district’s year-round beautification activities, as well as leading agency efforts to recruit and retain businesses in downtown Geneva. Linger said the city is more than holding its own, even in the age of Amazon.
 Linger pointed to some of Palmieri’s accomplishments, which include upgrading BID equipment and enhancing downtown business promotion.
 Palmieri pointed to those things as well, saying that for years BID took on hand-me-down equipment from the city because of the agency’s limited funds. He said he was able to generate additional BID money when he determined that some property owners in the assessment district — there are 142 overall — were not paying the additional taxes established to help fund BID.
 He said he also is proud to bring back BID’s merchant association as part of an effort to bolster downtown business promotion and retention and further engage merchants in the organization. BID’s biggest event is the annual Cruisin’ Night and Block Party each July.

Salami praised Soleimani's work, describing him as essential to backing Palestinian groups, Yemen's Houthi rebels and Shiite militias in Iraq and Syria. As a martyr, Soleimani represented an even greater threat to Iran's enemies, Salami said.
 Soleimani will ultimately be laid to rest between the graves of Enayatollah Talebizadeh and Mohammad Hossein Yousef Elahi, two former Guard comrades killed in Iran's 1980s war with Iraq. They died in Operation Dawn 8, in which Soleimani also took part. It was a 1986 amphibious assault that cut Iraq off from the Persian Gulf and led to the end of the war that killed 1 million.
 The funeral processions in major cities over three days have been an unprecedented honor for Soleimani, seen by Iranians as a national hero for his work leading the Guard’s expeditionary Quds Force.
 The U.S. blames him for killing U.S. troops in Iraq and accused him of plotting new attacks just before he was killed. Soleimani also led forces supporting Syrian President Bashar Assad in that country's civil war, and he also served as the point man for Iranian proxies in countries like Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen. Russian President Vladimir Putin met with Assad in Syria on Tuesday amid the tensions between Washington and Tehran.
 Soleimani's slaying already has led Tehran to abandon the remaining limits of its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers as his successor and others vow to take revenge.
 In Iraq, pro-Iranian factions in parliament have pushed to oust American troops from Iraqi soil following Soleimani's killing. Germany and Canada announced plans to move some of their soldiers in Iraq to neighboring countries.
 The FAA warning barred U.S. pilots and carriers from flying over areas of Iraqi, Iranian and some Persian Gulf airspace. The region is a major East-West travel hub and home to Emirates airline and Dubai International Airport, the world's busiest for international travel. It earlier issued warnings after Iran shot down a U.S. military surveillance drone last year that saw airlines plan new routes to avoid the Strait of Hormuz.
 The U.S. Maritime Administration warned ships across the Mideast, citing the rising threats. “The Iranian response to this action, if any, is unknown, but there remains the possibility of Iranian action against U.S. maritime interests in the region,” it said.
 Oil tankers were targeted in mine attacks last year that the U.S. blamed on Iran. Tehran denied responsibility, although it did seize oil tankers around the crucial Strait of Hormuz, the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf through which 20% of the world’s crude oil travels.
 The U.S. Navy's Bahrain-based 5th Fleet said it would work with shippers in the region to minimize any possible threat.
 The 5th Fleet “has and will continue to provide advice to merchant shipping as appropriate regarding recommended security precautions in light of the heightened tensions and threats in the region,” 5th Fleet spokesman Cmdr. Joshua Frey told The Associated Press.
 Iran's parliament, meanwhile, has passed an urgent bill declaring the U.S. military's command at the Pentagon and those acting on its behalf in Soleimani's killing as “terrorists," subject to Iranian sanctions. The measure appears to be in response to a decision by Trump in April to declare the Revolutionary Guard a “terrorist organization.”
 The U.S. Defense Department used that terror designation to support the strike that killed Soleimani.

NEW YORK — Researchers on Wednesday reported the largest-ever one-year decline in the U.S. cancer death rate, a drop they credited to advances in lung-tumor treatments.
 The overall cancer death rate has been falling about 1.5% a year since 1991. It fell 2.2% from 2016 to 2017, according to the new American Cancer Society report. That’s the largest drop ever seen in national cancer statistics going back to 1930, said Rebecca Siegel, the lead author.
 “It’s absolutely driven by lung cancer,” which accounts for about a quarter of all cancer deaths, she said. Take lung cancer out of the mix, and the 2017 rate drop is 1.4%, she added.
 Government researchers previously reported a slightly lower drop in the cancer death rate for the same period. But the Cancer Society calculates the death rate differently, and on Wednesday said the decline was larger — and record- setting.
 Most lung cancer cases are tied to smoking, and decades of declining smoking rates led to falling rates of lung cancer illnesses and deaths.
 But the drop in deaths seems to have been accelerated by recent lung cancer treatment advances, Siegel said.
 Experts mainly credit advances in treatment. Topping the list are refinements in surgery, better diagnostic scanning, and more precise use of radiation.
 They also celebrate the impact of newer drugs. Genetic testing can now identify specific cancer cell mutations, which allow more targeted therapy using newer pharmaceuticals that are a step beyond traditional chemotherapy.
 “It’s an exciting time,” said Dr. Jyoti Patel, a Northwestern University lung cancer expert.
 Even patients with late-stage cancers are surviving for several years — rather than months — after treatment starts, she said. “That was very, very uncommon a decade ago,” she said.
 New immunotherapy drugs could accelerate the death rate decline, Patel said.
 Cancer Society researchers also found:
 — The overall cancer death rate fell by nearly 30% from 1991 through 2017.
 — Death rates from one type of skin cancer dropped even more dramatically than lung cancer — falling 7% a year recently. That decline in melanoma patients is attributed to drugs that came on the market about nine years ago.
 — Declines in the death rates from prostate, breast and colon cancer are slowing, for a range of reasons.
 — The rising liver cancer death rate seems to have leveled off somewhat. That may be related to better treatment of hepatitis C infections, which are tied to about 25% of liver cancer cases, Siegel said.

With the start of a new year, and the start of a new decade, Van Buren Mayor Jonathon Hurst and the Van Buren community are thinking ahead on the future of their city.   As the city began to cross over into a new decade Tuesday night and the New Year's ball dropped in downtown Van Buren, shops stayed open late, vendors were selling food, and everyone prepared themselves for the countdown.   Patricia Howard sat in front of her store Main Street Candy and Fudge Shop and mentioned that she wanted to see downtown Van Buren become more financially healthy. Howard recounted all the changes the downtown has gone through over the years.   "Downtown moves in cycles," she said. "There is always a down cycle and an up cycle. Right now, we are in an upcycle."   In Howard's eyes downtown is growing, but it will need help from the community to get where it needs to be. She related it to the chicken and the egg. Which comes first? Will the things that draw the community towards downtown come first or will the community start working together to build the city up?   Hurst wants Van Buren to become a competitive location for attracting new businesses and retaining existing businesses.   "In 2019, I worked with Western Arkansas Planning and Development to create a Business Retention and Expansion Program," Hurst said. "Through coordinated outreach and communication between community leaders and local businesses, the needs, and then help to connect them to resources and support, currently, I have formed a BR&E leadership team made up of representatives from local businesses, big and small. I hope to begin business outreach in the first quarter of 2020."   Hurst went on to say the government can't solve all the problems, but he has seen communities improve when the government forms partnerships with citizens.   Debbie Foliart, one of the owners of Chapters on Main, is very involved with the development and growth of the city. She says that right now the priority is residential living outside of Main Street for the group Van Buren Original, as well as the economic development of the city.  The continued growth and development in downtown for retail and hospitality is also very important to her.   Hurst also said he would continue to implement the parks plan and will work with Parks and Recreation in 2020 to determine the next project.   "Our streetscape that the mayor is working on currently will make a strong impact on this also for downtown and how we are able to approach new business and new consumers," Foliart added.   "The downtown streetscape project will begin sometime in 2020," Hurst noted. "We received a $492,000 grant from ARDOT to add new downtown sidewalks, landscaping, irrigation, and other elements to beautify downtown and make it more pedestrian friendly."   The consensus among the people of Van Buren is that the community and government must work together to make their vision for Van Buren come to fruition in 2020.   "I'm excited about the future of Van Buren because the volunteerism and civic purpose here is second to none," Hurst concluded. "By working together, we can move forward, and I am grateful for the opportunity to help us get there."

GAINESVILLE, Fla.-- It has been a solid week for the Florida secondary.
 In the last few days both Marco Wilson and Shawn Davis have announced their intentions of staying for another season and not enter the NFL draft.
 With Florida losing junior cornerback CJ Henderson to the NFL and senior safety Jeawon Taylor due to eligibility, having two veterans like Wilson and Davis returning is big for the young secondary.
 But let us not forget the talented underclassmen that are ready to step up in 2020 as well.
 "All the freshmen have to step up but they have been stepping up since fall camp because they have been getting a lot of reps," cornerback Marco Wilson told Gators Territory. "Maybe not a whole bunch of game reps, but we have been trying to throw them in here and there so they are prepared. They have been practicing like they have been getting ready for a game. I'm really excited to see how they continue to grow."
 "All of those guys have been a pleasant surprise in the sense of that they have taken the coaching and they are working hard to be good players," defensive coordinator Todd Grantham said. "I think all of those guys moving forward are going to be good for us."
 Kaiir Elam has stolen a lot of the headlines so far.
 The true freshman earned a starting spot when Wilson had to move to nickel from corner.
 "When you look at Elam, he is a guy that is really patient," said Grantham. "He will play the ball in the air and he takes coaching."
 Elam picked off three passes this season, including one in the Orange Bowl against Virginia - and considering he predominately played on special teams and saw limited snaps up until the final three games, thats a good illustration __ of whats in store for the unit.
 The South Florida native also recorded one pass break up in the win over the Wahoos, while amassing 11 tackles and four pass break ups.
 Elam is going to be good, however, it is not a time to sleep on either Jaydon Hill or Chester Kimbrough either.
 Although Hill has played in few more games than Kimbrough in 2019, the Louisiana native has caught the attention of a few Gators receivers.
 "Chester's really good; he's going to be really good," said wide receiver Van Jefferson. "Him and Kaiir and Jaydon, they're going to be really good. I think those guys, CJ and Marco, they're going to elevate their game. I know when they get in this season they're going to make some big plays for us. They've been doing good, but Chester's really good. Chester's really good."
 "I've been slept on all my life because of my size that doesn't phase me," Kimbrough told Gators Territory in an exclusive interview. " I just take the criticism and makes me push harder."
 Kimbrough feels blessed to be recognized by his teammates.
 "I'm just trying to push those boys to be better, so they can make the plays that they made today [Orange Bowl]," he said. "It's an honor hearing that from them."
 According to Kimbrough, his redshirt year has allowed him to work on his tackling, which he will continue to work on as he hopes to get his weight up this offseason.
 "Coach [Torrian] Gray really just made me a learner on the field, beyond the physicality but brought me up on the mentality side as well," said Kimbrough. "Grantham is always on my behind."
 Kimbrough is a versatile option for Grantham and his staff - he can line up both at corner and at nickel.
 "I play both. It doesn't matter where I play. I'm still going to play ball. I can play anywhere," he said. To me it's the same. I just have to go against a couple of faster people [at nickel], but I find it easy because my hips are twitchy."
 Florida has also added talented recruits to the roster this offseason including: Mordecai McDaniel, Ethan Pouncey, Jahari Rogers, Fenley Graham, Tre'Vez Johnson, Avery Helm and Rashad Torrence - all of which signed their LOIs back in December.
 The Gators still have Marc Britt, an athlete they have recruited at safety, committed, while they are also pursuing talented safety Avantae Williams ahead of February's signing day.
 What can you take from this?
 The secondary is young but talented.
 "We are all trying to ball," said Kimbrough. "We are all trying to eat."

At least one Kansas lawmaker wants to do away with Daylight Savings Time.
 This seems like a waste of time. Pun fully intended.
 In early January, a Wichita TV station reported State Rep. Kristey Williams, R-August, plans to take a swing at Daylight Savings Time. Last year she introduced a bill that would exempt the state from "fall back" and "spring forward." A bill she plans to introduce this year, House Bill No. 2422, would establish daylight saving time as the permanent standard time for the entire state. Currently, 101 of Kansas' 105 counties use Central Standard Time, while Sherman, Wallace, Greeley and Hamilton, all of which border Colorado, use Mountain Time.
 "In Kansas, most citizens don't want to stay on standard time all the time, and the reason is simple. We want more daylight hours, hours when we are awake and less when we're sleeping," Williams told KWCH-TV.
 There are lots of consequences to consider with this legislation. Think about what communities on state borders might go through if we made this switch. Imagine what people who live in the Kansas City metro might have to deal with daily especially for those who work on the other side of the border.
 And let's not forget to consider the confusion that might take place for western Kansans who will no doubt also have to make adjustments as this is implemented.
 Frankly, there's no time for this. Lawmakers are only in Topeka for about 90 days and the clock starts ticking Jan. 13. There's work to be done and legislators really shouldn't be debating what time it is.
 Lawmakers have to deal with questions about possible Medicaid expansion, tax reform, medical marijuana and the opioid crisis, among many others. These issues are far weightier. They have larger impacts on Kansans from Tribune to Topeka to Hutchinson and Holton, and deserve the full attention of our elected officials.
 This legislation reeks of elevator music, bad movies and polite conversation -- all things that while well-intentioned really are by design only helpful to kill time.
 We expect them to practice good time management in the Statehouse. That can be easier said than done of course, but avoiding this issue just seems like common sense.
 Perhaps when the true issues of the day have been tackled then we can turn to father time and ask what his watch says. But until then, we'll say this to the lawmakers in the back, please don't waste time debating time.

Two hundred thirty three. That’s the number on Sharon Eubanks’ file at CASA for Kids, an organization that advocates for children placed in the foster care system. Two hundred thirty three children were served by local volunteers last year — 233 of the 52,397 children currently in the Texas child welfare system.
 The catch? Some of these children were placed as far away as Houston or out along the Texas coast. Why? Because there’s a major lack of foster families here in the Red River Valley, said Eubanks, CASA’s executive director.
 “It’s a huge need,” she said. “Some of our volunteers are driving as far as Houston to visit these kids. Some are local, some are away. And we appreciate our foster families so much, but we need more.”

Kelechi Iheanacho came off the bench to keep Leicester in contention for a place in the League Cup final as the Nigerian striker's late goal earned a 1-1 draw against Aston Villa on Wednesday.
 Brendan Rodgers' side fell behind to Frederic Guilbert's first half goal in the semi-final first leg at the King Power Stadium.
 But Iheanacho equalised after the break with his sixth goal in eight appearances this season.
 Leicester will feel they should have won after dominating for long periods, but the team in second place in the Premier League will have to finish the job at Villa Park in the second leg on January 28.
 Rodgers has a remarkable record of advancing from his last 30 domestic cup ties with Liverpool, Celtic and Leicester.
 But the last team to beat Rodgers in a domestic knockout competition were Villa in the FA Cup semi-final in 2014-15 when he was Liverpool manager.
 And Villa, whose last major trophy was the 1996 League Cup, will feel they are in pole position to reach the final after surviving a stern examination.
 The second leg winner will play Manchester City or Manchester United in the final at Wembley, with City leading 3-1 after their first leg at Old Trafford on Tuesday.
 Leicester last won the competition in 2000, beating Villa in the semi-finals that year, and they were well on top at the start.
 A scuffed clearance from Douglas Luiz was collected by Ayoze Perez, who saw his deflected effort flash just wide.
 Jamie Vardy was back after missing three games due to the birth of his daughter and a calf injury and took the fight to Villa.
 He seized Marvelous Nakamba's wayward header before testing Orjan Nyland, then saw his low drive blocked by Villa's keeper moments later.
 But, having soaked up Leicester's early blitz on a rain-drenched evening in the east midlands, it was Villa who snatched the lead against the run of play in the 28th minute.
 \- Infused with confidence -
 Anwar El Ghazi was playing in an unfamiliar role up front due to Wesley's injury and Jonathan Kodjia's illness.
 The winger drifted back out to the left flank to deliver a cross that landed perfectly for Guilbert, who got in front of Ben Chilwell and stabbed his volley in from close-range.
 The French defender's first goal since August was Villa's first shot on target in the match.
 Infused with confidence after that bolt from the blue, Smith's team were inches away from doubling their lead before half-time.
 Jack Grealish's inswinging free-kick found Ezri Konsa and the Villa defender headed against the bar from inside the six-yard box.
 Leicester wrestled back the initiative after the interval and Nyland alertly smothered the danger when Vardy tried to latch onto a through ball.
 Tyrone Mings won header after header as Villa tried to weather the storm and when James Maddison did get past the defender with a bold burst, Nyland was on hand to make another good save.
 Maddison tried again with a run onto Ricardo Pereira's pass, but the Norwegian saved at the near post.
 Leicester's pressure finally told in the 74th minute.
 Luiz, put in trouble by Konsa's sloppy free-kick, lost possession to Hamza Choudhury and Vardy found Iheanacho, who shot high past Nyland from 15 yards.
 Vardy nearly won it in the closing minutes, but his shot rippled into the side-netting just as Leicester fans were anticipating a dramatic finale.

 The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Natural Resources Conservation Service and the town of Walpole are co-sponsoring two public scoping meetings to discuss the proposed Allen Site Dam rehabilitation project in Walpole.
 The meetings will be held Jan. 14 in room 126 at the Walpole Town Hall, 135 School St., Walpole. An afternoon meeting will be held at 3 p.m. for agencies, organizations and watershed associations, but it is also open to the public. An evening meeting will be held at 6:30 p.m. for the general public.
 Staff from the federal and local agencies, along with their consultants, will provide information on the dam rehabilitation program and planning activities to-date for Allen Site Dam. They will also describe rehabilitation alternatives being considered for this floodwater retarding structure, answer questions, address concerns and seek public input about the planned rehabilitation work.
 The Allen Site Dam is a multi-purpose flood control and recreation structure located in the Diamond Brook Watershed in Walpole, which offers flood protection to residents and businesses located downstream. Local sponsors, NRCS staff, and their consultants are developing a plan to rehabilitate this structure to meet current dam safety regulations and design standards. Alternatives being considered include decommissioning or dam removal, structural rehabilitation, nonstructural measures and no action.
 Planning is scheduled to be completed by Dec. 31. Federal funding has been received to assist the local sponsors in developing the plan but has not yet been secured for the design or construction of this project.
 NRCS provides reasonable accommodations to enable all persons with disabilities to participate in agency programs and activities.
 For special accommodations or information on the meeting, contact Jim Lyons, civil engineer, NRCS, at 774-345-7027 or Jim.Lyons@usda.gov.

The pressure of holding up my family’s world totally broke me, and before I knew it, my limbs were flailing around uncontrollably as I fought hard to take a deep breath.

As a result, much of mainstream media and Hollywood took it upon themselves to personally apologize for the country, and beg for mercy from the Iranian government. The same Iranian government that has been planning and paying the freight on all sorts of nefarious shenanigans in Iraq and elsewhere. Whereas such comments are obviously problematic on a number of different levels, the one that sort of stood up the short hairs on the back of my neck, was the badly mistaken arrogance that assumed they had and or have any right, reason or responsibility to presume to speak for me and mine. They obviously missed one of the most important lessons smarter people learned growing up. Never — ever — apologize for anyone else’s behavior. Period. Doing so is not only erroneous, manipulative and arrogant, but doomed to severely annoy both the recipient and the presumed source. It’s an obvious manipulation tactic, and everybody involved knows it. You ain’t fooling anybody. All you succeed in doing is proving beyond a doubt that you cannot be trusted by anyone, friend and foe alike.
 In short, put a sock in it, Hollywood. You damn well don’t need to be apologizing for me, the president or anyone else. If you feel the need to make your opinion known, speak only for your own selves. Leave the rest of us out of it.
 Among other gems flung out by one of the frequent flingers of fantasy and foolishness was the statement from Michael Moore that folks like me should be feared as dangerous and untrainable. I’ll only take exception to part of that because a lot of “Oscar Foxtrots” like myself kinda like to be thought of as dangerous. That thought is enough to make me suck in my gut, poke out my chest and growl softly ... until the effort brings on the inevitable choking sensation and the entire effort dissolves into a coughing fit.
 It also doesn’t exactly square with the fact that a lot of us sit down to put on our pants these days because if we try to do it standing up, there’s a good chance a couple of toes will get hung up in a leg hole and we end up hopping around a while, and then end up sitting on our bums anyway. I’m also too realistic to argue much with that whole untrainable thing. Whereas my grandmother referred to herself as “strong willed,” she flatly labeled me as plain old stubborn, and quite likely to stay that way.
 And all that sort of brings me back around to the kabuki theater inside the beltway. It’s all about the timing of things, I suppose. And in that respect, the Democrats in the House are running a substantial risk. Regardless of the undying hope of lightning strikes and serendipity, the whole mess seems to be all about trying to suck some kind of hope out of the coming election. But that’s a daunting task. They must achieve and consolidate their hold on certain voting blocks and groups while the contents thereof are still wandering somewhere between being “woke” and being truly awakened.

US lawmakers across the political spectrum called for de-escalation of tensions with Iran Wednesday following back-and-forth airstrikes, but clear divisions remained over President Donald Trump's military strategy with Tehran.
 Republicans praised the commander in chief for signalling he had no immediate plans to respond militarily hours after Iran's missile strikes on Iraqi bases housing American troops.
 Iran's riposte followed the death of a top-ranked Iranian commander from a US drone attack.
 Many Democrats seethed over Trump's unilateral order to kill the Iranian commander, Qasem Soleimani, without congressional consent. But they took heart in both sides appearing to choose de-escalation rather than a war posture.
 Trump addressed the nation to say Iran appeared to be "standing down" and that the United States was prepared to embrace peace.
 "I am pleased that President Trump has pulled back and taken the preferred path of no further military action," tweeted Republican Senator Rand Paul, who has long advocated a US troop withdrawal from Iraq.
 "I don't think this is the end of it, but I hope it is," he added to reporters before Defense Secretary Mark Esper and other officials briefed US lawmakers on the situation.
 Senator Lindsey Graham, a hawkish Trump loyalist, sounded grateful to see tensions lowered.
 "In my view, retaliation for the sake of retaliation is not necessary at this time," Graham tweeted.
 The Republican senator said Trump struck the right tone. "To the Iranian people and the regime, he's given you a chance to end this peacefully," Graham told reporters.
 \- 'De-escalate' -
 Graham and other lawmakers were to meet Wednesday with British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, before he holds talks with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
 The United States and Iran, longtime foes, stumbled towards a potentially catastrophic confrontation in recent days.
 Tensions between the US and Iran had been escalating since Trump reimposed crippling economic sanctions following the US withdrawal in 2018 from a multinational accord that promised Tehran sanctions relief in return for curbs on its nuclear program.
 But the situation escalated massively when Soleimani was killed. Days later Iran retaliated with a volley of missiles aimed at Iraqi bases where US troops are stationed.
 Trump said no Americans were harmed in those attacks, and Tehran signalled it did not seek further confrontation.
 "One could draw from (Iran's remarks) that they want to de-escalate," number two House Democrat Steny Hoyer said.
 "Both sides have said that that's their objective," he added. "Our hope is that that is what happens."
 Senate Democrat Ben Cardin said that while Americans will debate the pros and cons of "how we got to this moment," the priority is protecting US troops, de- escalating the conflict and engaging allies.
 "I thought the president's speech in that regard gives us some hope that that could happen," Cardin told AFP.
 Senator Robert Menendez has been a fierce critic of the president but softened that stance after Trump's address.
 "At the end of the day, the president's speech, knowing him, is about as de- escalatory as it gets," Menendez said.
 But the Democrat took issue with Trump's strategy of ratcheting up tensions only to claim a win by easing off.
 He and other Democrats insist that any further military action against Iran occur only with congressional authorization.
 Several Republicans say Trump did not need to consult Congress because he was acting to protect threatened US interests, with congresswoman Liz Cheney hailing the "righteousness" of the attack on Soleimani.

The first meeting of the year for the City Planning Commission saw a fairly light agenda with only nine items and two were tabled for next month's meeting.
 The first item was a request to start an in-home aesthetician and skin care business. If the commission allowed this request to go through, the owner, Nina Diaz, would be able to have two customers in her home at a time. Since there was no opposition, Diaz's request will move forward to the meeting next week.
 The two items that were tabled were also on the agenda for the Board of Directors meeting Tuesday night. Conner Threet, the agent for ERC Create, LLC, made a request to rezone and develop a lot on Chad Colley Boulevard. This request was approved by the Planning Commission and passed on to the Board of Directors for final approval.
 However, due to a lack of communication, mailed notifications of the neighborhood meeting were not sent out. In light of Circuit Judge R. Gunner DeLay's opinion in favor of the residents on December 27, 2019, against St. Scholastica in the Casey Property, Threet and the Planning Commission decided to ask the board to withdraw this item so that no action would be taken. The Times Record wrote about the Casey property on December 31, 2019. This decision may lead to an amendment to ordinances so that applicants will only need to send mailers to residents within 300 feet of the plot in question rather than the whole property.
 Bob Keesee pointed out that according to State Law, businesses only need to put a notification in the local paper to inform area residents of the proposed zoning change. The City of Fort Smith, however, requires mailer notices as well as signage at the property and a public notice in the local paper. One commission member suggested certified mail because that would ensure the mailers were sent, but the rest of the commission decided that would be too expensive for the applicant.
 Threet and ERC had two more rezoning items on the agenda where they altered their original plan to build duplexes on Veterans Avenue to build 27 single family homes.
 Blew & Associates had three items on the agenda in relation to the new O'Reilly's Auto Parts where they are requesting rezoning and development plans to bring everything on that piece of land up to code before starting to build.
 The final item on the agenda was a rezoning on Collier Street from Not Zoned to Planned Zoning District. Currently, the property is used for warehouses, but the owners want the option for future development.
 The next Planning Commission meeting will be Tuesday, January 14, at 5:30pm in the Rose Room of the Creekmore Community Center.

You could be the next Tom Brady and be set up to make millions and millions of dollars in your career, but one wrong step — or not even wrong; we all have heard about ACL injuries being just simply freak accidents — and all of that could be taken away.
 It’s so important to have something to fall back on.
 At the high school level, putting an emphasis on academics isn’t just important for those reasons but it’s also a key factor in getting recruited. The NCAA has standards at which a student-athlete cannot play if he or she does not meet those requirements. And even if you do technically meet the minimum standards, having a high GPA or a good ACT score makes your resume that much more attractive to college recruiters and coaches.
 If you talk to Reeltown coach Matt Johnson, I’d be willing to bet the thing he’d tell you he’s most proud of about Cameron Faison’s journey to the next level is the academic side. Sure, Johnson loved the fact Faison could run fast and score touchdowns and intercept balls like they were meant for him, but what gave Johnson a glimmer in his eye was how Faison made a decision to get on the right academic path.
 Even Faison is willing to admit the toughest part about his recruitment was making sure his academic standards were up to snuff, but he made up his mind he wanted to play at the next level and he made it happen. Now he’s headed to a top JUCO in Dodge City, Kansas, and it wouldn’t surprise me at all to see Faison playing alongside (or maybe against) Division I-bound Eric Shaw in the coming years.

Superior Court Judge Allen Baddour said last month that he is reconsidering his approval of the deal. Baddour approved an agreement on Nov. 27 in which the SCV agreed to take ownership of the "Silent Sam" statue and build a center to preserve it. The statue stood for more than a century on the Chapel Hill campus before protesters took it down in August 2018. The university agreed to put $2.5 million into a trust to help defray the costs of the new center.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Wednesday that Canada would demand a thorough investigation after scores of its citizens died when a Ukrainian jetliner crashed in Iran.
 The Iranian community in Canada was plunged into mourning following the accident shortly after the plane took off from Tehran on Wednesday, killing all on board.
 "I join Canadians across the country who are shocked and saddened to see reports that a plane crash outside of Tehran, Iran, has claimed the lives of 176 people, including 63 Canadians," Trudeau said in a statement.
 Ukraine International Airlines (UIA), the ex-Soviet country's privately owned flag carrier, said flight PS752 left Tehran airport at 6:10 am and disappeared from radars just two minutes later.
 "Our government will continue to work closely with its international partners to ensure that this crash is thoroughly investigated, and that Canadians' questions are answered," Trudeau said.
 According to Ukraine, 82 Iranians, 10 Swedes, four Afghans, three Germans and three Britons were on the Boeing 737 in addition to the Canadians. Eleven Ukrainians -- including the nine crew -- were also on board.
 Canada is home to a large Iranian diaspora and UIA offers relatively inexpensive flights between Toronto and Tehran, with a layover in Kiev.
 "One of my friends, his wife, and his two young girls were killed," Payman Parseyan, from Edmonton, told Canada's national broadcaster CBC.
 "It's devastating," he said.
 "Every one of our community members was touched in one way or another... Many of these people were international students. They didn't have their families here.
 "Many of them gave up a life that they had in Iran, the people that they knew. They worked tirelessly to get to where they were, all to lose it like this. It's terrible."
 The crash came with regional tensions heightened over the US killing of a top Iranian general, and shortly after Tehran launched missiles at bases in Iraq housing US troops.
 There was no immediate indication of foul play and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned against speculating on the cause of the disaster.
 Trudeau said Foreign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne had been in touch with the government of Ukraine, and was speaking to "relevant authorities and to international partners."
 He added that Canadian Minister of Transport Marc Garneau was working with officials from Transport Canada and contacting international counterparts.
 Search-and-rescue teams were combing through the smoking wreckage of the flight, which slammed into farmland at Khalaj Abad, in Shahriar county, but officials said there was no hope of finding anyone alive.

An episode begins with the trainer detailing the number of stress injuries with the relative ease of reciting a grocery list. Without being exploitative, "Cheer" shows the emotional toll that comes with competitive pressure on and off the mat. Some of them come from family stressors, others from an overwhelming impact on social media, while more can come from the team.
