Amazon is one of the leading online retailers and their influence only grew during throughout the quarantine. Its’ online marketplace features anything you might need from your next read to a weighted blanket to keep you cozy at night. The plus is that the company is insanely fast with features like Amazon prime, you might order something and have it at your door the same day.

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Tuesday voiced regret over a stalemate in maritime border talks between Israel and Lebanon and offered Washington's meditation.
 The two nations which remain technically at war opened negotiations in October after quiet US diplomacy, seeking to clear the way for offshore oil and gas exploration sought by both.
 "Regrettably, despite goodwill on both sides, the parties remain far apart," said Pompeo, who has one month left in office after President Donald Trump's electoral defeat.
 "The United States remains ready to mediate constructive discussions and urges both sides to negotiate based on the respective maritime claims both have previously deposited at the United Nations."
 The Trump administration has heralded major progress in its waning days in Israel's relations with the Arab world.
 Since October, four Arab nations have agreed to recognize the Jewish state.
 The latest session of talks between Israel and Lebanon was put off after the Jewish state accused its neighbor of inconsistency.
 The two nations have been negotiating based on a map registered with the United Nations in 2011, which shows an 860-square-kilometer (330-square-mile) patch of sea as being disputed.
 But Lebanon considers that map to have been based on wrong estimates and now demands an additional 1,430 square kilometers (552 square miles) of sea farther south, which includes part of Israel's Karish gas field, according to Lebanese energy expert Laury Haytayan.

Jacobs earns his first selection to the annual All-Star game after becoming the team’s all-time rushing leaders through a player’s first two seasons (2,057 yards). Through 14 games in 2020, Jacobs ranks third in rushing attempts (245), sixth in rushing yards (907) and is tied for sixth in rushing touchdowns (10). The second-year rusher has logged at least two touchdowns in three contests this season, one of four players in the NFL to accomplish the feat, including a three-touchdown performance in Week 1, tied for an NFL-high among all players. His three touchdowns tied a single-game franchise record, as he became just the second player in NFL history with at least two rushing touchdowns in Week 1 of both their rookie season and second season. In Week 10, he recorded his sixth career multi-touchdown game on the ground, trailing only Eric Dickerson’s and Ezekiel Elliott’s seven such games for most in NFL history through a player’s first 22 contests. This past game in Week 15, Jacobs became just the fourth running back in club history to log double-digit rushing touchdowns in a single season and sits just 93 yards shy of his second consecutive 1,000 yard season with two games remaining.

New Delhi, Dec 22 (PTI) Probing a Rs 299-crore Indian Overseas Bank loan fraud case, similar to the alleged USD 2 billion worth PNB swindle, the Enforcement Directorate has found that the accused "paid" for the air travel and hotel stay of a senior bank manager and his family as kickbacks.
 The central probe agency said "lapses" were also detected on the part of at least three managers -- Anil Kumar, P C Rana and N Chokalingam -- of the IOB branch in Chandigarh, "as well as the concurrent auditors."
 The ED case is related to its criminal money laundering investigation "in a case related to buyers credit fraud of Rs 299.14 crore at the IOB, Chandigarh".
 The agency took congnisance of an FIR filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), to file a case under various sections of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) against IOB Assistant Manager Ashu Mehra, properitor of heights international company Amanpreet Singh Sodhi, owner of vision procon company Dinesh Kumar and directors of a firm saibhakti impex Pvt ltd -- Gaurav Kirpal and Aman Kirpal.
 "A charge sheet was filed by the CBI against the accused revealing wrongful loss to the tune of Rs 299.14 crore to the bank on account of fraudulent unpaid LOUs (letter of undertaking) and that an amount of Rs 11.36 crore commission for 24 LOUs was also not received by the bank," the ED said.
 A similar modus operandi of misusing the LOUs has been alleged by probe agencies in the Brady House branch (Mumbai) of the Punjab National Bank (PNB) that led to a fraud estimated to be worth USD 2 billion, which came to light in 2018.
 Diamond merchants Nirav Modi and his uncle Mehul Choksi have been alleged as the masterminds of this swindling, identified as one of the biggest case of bank loan fraud in the country.
 About the latest case, the ED said its probe found that the accused Amanpreet Singh Sodhi, Dinesh Kumar and Gaurav Kirpal "conspired" with IOB assistant manager Ashu Mehra "for illegal diversion of funds to the bank accounts of fraudulent buyers on behalf of Indian import firms."
 "These amounts were first credited by the overseas funding bank -- Bank of Baroda, Bahamas and PNB, Dubai -- into the HSBC Account of the Hong Kong-based export company Colour Wave (HK) Ltd though no imports took place."
 "The accumulated amount in the HSBC Account was further remitted to India in the accounts of accused companies by showing it as adjustments for exports of third-party payments," the ED alleged.
 It was found, the ED said, that the goods were either exported by the accused to different buyers or consignees by resorting "to gross over-valuation or in some cases there was "no export.
 "In this manner the accused have generated the proceeds of crime by resorting to trade-based money laundering," the ED claimed.
 It was found that "payments for the air travels and hotel stays of the accused Ashu Mehra and his family members was borne by accused Dinesh Kumar and Gaurav Kirpal", the agency said.
 The agency has attached properties worth over Rs 91 crore of various accused involved in the case till now, with an attachment of Rs 6.03 crore being done recently.
