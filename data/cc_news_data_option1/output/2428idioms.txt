The Geneseo City Council met in special session Friday June 12, to try once again to pass the Budget for the six month period of July to December, 2020.
   
 Jo Hollenkamp, City Administrator, spoke regarding the necessity to begin "Impact Bargaining" with the city's unions. Under the proposed budget, even if the lockdown had not depressed the revenue stream, the previously negotiated raises would have the City in deficit spending. When questioned on where the figures came from, Hollenkamp cited that the figure was the best estimate given to the office from several reliable retail sources.
   
 Mayor Sean Johnson had been in conversation with car dealerships, who informed him that this period was worse than after 9/11. Cars just are not being sold, and the associated sales tax is not being received.
   
 Administrator Hollenkamp also pointed out that during the lockdown time frame, schools, The Community Center, restaurants, bars, and many public buildings were closed, which also impacted the revenue coming from City electric. This is further compounded by the fact the City is still spending more than it is taking in.
   
 To illustrate the difference in why the previous administrations, and this one, are so far apart on the state of the City, Hollenkamp asked Paula Meyer of Dixon to look at the ways the finances for the City had been presented. Meyer holds a Masters in Accounting from NIU, and spent 5 years in public accounting, specializing in auditing. She had become the Director of Finance for the City of Dixon in the period after the Rita Crundwell embezzlement, and currently serves as the Lee County Treasurer.
   
 "You have requested my take on the difference between Fund Balance and Reserves available for annual operations. Cash, which is a component of the Fund Balance, is the Reserve available for annual operations. The Fund Balance is the total value of the fund. Many assets included in Fund Balance are not liquid and therefore are not available to provide working capital. Although these assets have value, they are not liquid and therefore cannot be used to pay expenses such as salaries and repairs or purchase new equipment. If electric services were to cease, these assets could then be sold and used to pay off debt and pension liabilities." pointed out Meyer.
   
 Meyer also noted that the Electric Department's reserve of cash is decreasing annually, because revenues have not kept up with increasing costs., debt and equipment replacement.
   
 The current administration only looks at the Cash Balances when budgeting. As it was explained, by City Administrator, Hollenkamp, "You would not sell your car to buy groceries. Of course you will use the cash in your checkbook." When the current Finance Manager talks about Finances, the figures used are the Checking account balances, since you can't spend a bucket truck unless you sell it first. And you may need it to generate revenue.
   
 Mayor Johnson noted, that "Even if we had last year's revenues, the City would still be in trouble, with the regular depletion of cash balances. "
   
 Alderman Bob James stated that "We didn't get here yesterday. I would love to see a lower amount of deficit. We will have to look at foregoing raises and taking furlough days. It will help keep employees working."
   
 The Mayor noted that "We have been borrowing from the funds for years, and spending on projects. There has been no replenishment. It should come as no surprise that we are in this situation."
   
 Another observation that the Mayor made was regarding the virus, "The good news will be that nothing happens, and the economy rebounds, the bad news would be if there is a second wave, and austerity measures come back." Johnson advocated cost control measures at this time. "But at the end of the day, we need to find new revenue sources."
   
 The Council ultimately unanimously approved the Budget 8-0 the way it was presented, with the 40% shortfall in revenues, and no raises to City employees. As revenues come in, those figures will be considered, and the budget will be brought up to real time.
   
 Jo Ann Hollenkamp was approved to participate in Impact Bargaining with the City's unions. A sale of surplus City property may be in the works. A hard look at having employees contribute to their health insurance will need to happen.
   
 Mayor Johnson stated " Everyone is going to get a hit, citizens with a utility hike, city employees, everyone. No employee did anything wrong, but we will all have to sacrifice for the good of the whole. We are all in this together."

After his 12-season tenure with the team, he led in goals (346) and points (756). He led the team in scoring for 7 seasons, scored 30 or more goals 6 times, and had three-straight seasons with 40 or more goals. Along with Todd Bertuzzi and Brendan Morrison, the trio formed the West Coast Express line. The line was the primary reason the franchise was successful in the early 2000s. The 2002-03 season was the best example of their domination as Naslund scored 48 goals and had 103 points, while Bertuzzi scored 46 goals and 97 points. Morrison hit a career high as well with 25 goals and 71 points that season. At 35, he signed a two-year deal with the New York Rangers, retiring after his first season with the team.

OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) - Did teens, TikTok users and fans of Korean pop music troll the president of the United States?For more than a week before Donald Trump‚Äôs first campaign rally in three months on Saturday in Tulsa, Oklahoma, these tech-savvy groups opposing the president mobilized to reserve tickets for an event they had no intention of attending. While it‚Äôs unlikely they were responsible for the low turnout, their antics may have inflated the campaign‚Äôs expectations for attendance numbers that led to Saturday‚Äôs disappointing show.‚ÄúMy 16 year old daughter and her friends in Park City, Utah, have hundreds of tickets. You have been rolled by America‚Äôs teens,‚Äù veteran Republican campaign strategist Steve Schmidt tweeted on Saturday. The tweet garnered more than 100,000 likes and many responses from people who say they or their kids did the same.Reached by telephone Sunday, Schmidt called the rally an "unmitigated disaster" ‚Äî days after Trump campaign chairman Brad Parscale tweeted that more than a million people requested tickets for the rally through Trump's campaign website.Andrew Bates, a spokesperson for Trump's Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, said the turnout was a sign of weakening voter support. "Donald Trump has abdicated leadership and it is no surprise that his supporters have responded by abandoning him," he said.In a statement, the Trump campaign blamed the "fake news media" for "warning people away from the rally" over COVID-19 and protests against racial injustice around the country."Leftists and online trolls doing a victory lap, thinking they somehow impacted rally attendance, don't know what they're talking about or how our rallies work," Parscale wrote. "Reporters who wrote gleefully about TikTok and K-Pop fans ‚Äî without contacting the campaign for comment ‚Äî behaved unprofessionally and were willing dupes to the charade."On midday Sunday, it was possible to sign up to stream a recap of the Tulsa event later in the day through Trump's website. It requested a name, email address and phone number. There was no age verification in the signup process, though the site required a PIN to verify phone numbers.Inside the 19,000-seat BOK Center in Tulsa, where Trump thundered that "the silent majority is stronger than ever before," numerous seats were empty. Tulsa Fire Department spokesperson Andy Little said the city fire marshal's office reported a crowd of just less than 6,200 in the arena.City officials had expected a crowd of 100,000 people or more in downtown Tulsa, but that never materialized. That said, the rally, which was broadcast on cable, also targeted voters in battleground states such as Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Florida.Social media users who have followed recent events might not be surprised by the way young people (and some older folks) mobilized to troll the president. They did it not just on TikTok but also on Twitter, Instagram and even Facebook. K-Pop fans ‚Äî who have a massive, coordinated online community and a cutting sense of humor ‚Äî have become an unexpected ally to American Black Lives Matter protesters.In recent weeks, they've been repurposing their usual platforms and hashtags from boosting their favorite stars to backing the Black Lives Matter movement. They flooded right-wing hashtags such as "white lives matter" and police apps with short video clips and memes of their K-pop stars. Many of the early social media messages urging people to sign up for tickets brought up the fact that the rally had originally been scheduled for Friday, June 19, which is Juneteenth, commemorating the end of slavery in the United States. Tulsa, the location for the rally, was the scene in 1921 of one of the most severe white-on-Black attacks in American history.Schmidt said he was not surprised. Today's teens, after all, grew up with phones and have "absolutely" mastered them, he said. They are also the first generation to have remote Zoom classes and have a "subversive sense of humor," having come of age in a world of online trolls and memes, Schmidt said. Most of all, he said, "they are aware of what is happening around them.""Like salmon in the river, they participate politically through the methods and means of their lives," Schmidt added.That said, the original idea for the mass ticket troll may have come not from a teen but from an Iowa woman. The politics site Iowa Starting Line found that a TikTok video posted on June 11 by Mary Jo Laupp, a 51-year-old grandmother from Fort Dodge, Iowa, suggesting that people book free tickets to "make sure there are empty seats." Laupp's video, which also tells viewers how to stop receiving texts from the Trump campaign after they provide their phone number (simply text "STOP"), has had more than 700,000 likes. It was also possible to sign up for the rally using a fake or temporary phone number from Google Voice, for instance.As Parscale himself pointed out in a June 14 tweet, though, the ticket signups were not simply about getting bodies to the rally. He called it the "Biggest data haul and rally signup of all time by 10x" ‚Äî meaning the hundreds of thousands of emails and phone numbers the campaign now has in its possession to use for microtargeting advertisements and to reach potential voters.Sure, it's possible that many of the emails are fake and that the ticket holders have no intention of voting for Trump in November. But while it's possible that this "bad data" might prove useless ‚Äî or even hurt the Trump campaign in some way ‚Äî experts say there is one clear beneficiary in the end, and that is Facebook. That's due to the complex, murky ways in which Trump's political advertising machine is tied up with the social media giant. Facebook wants data on people, and whether that is "good" or "bad," it will be used to train its systems."No matter who signs up or if they go to a rally, Trump gets data to train retargeting on Facebook. FB's system will use that data in ways that have nothing to do with Trump," tweeted Georgia Tech communications professor Ian Bogost. "Might these 'fake' signups mess up the Trump team's targeting data? Maybe it could, to some extent. But the entire system is so vast and incomprehensible, we'll never really know."___Associated Press writer Ali Swenson contributed to this story from Seattle.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.
