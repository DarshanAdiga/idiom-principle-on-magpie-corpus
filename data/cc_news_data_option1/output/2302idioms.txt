These delays are heartbreaking and completely unacceptable. Yet the problems continue to pile up. While sitting on this massive backlog of tens of thousands of unprocessed claims, the Beshear Administration withheld news of a critical security breach for more than a month, even though they are required to report such incidents to the public within days.
 Gov. Beshear had a press conference weeks ago, where he finally acknowledged it was time for better unemployment insurance results. Yet countless families are still waiting on those promised results, as his administration is still sitting on an enormous backlog of claims.
 Struggling Kentuckians cannot afford to wait any longer. If the governor is serious about his persistent claims that we are “all in this together,” then enough is enough. It is time for Gov. Beshear to quit stalling and fix this unemployment insurance disaster once and for all.

My son's first taste of tofu was at a restaurant. He didn't know what tofu was, or that it was coming. Having never caught wind of tofu's bad reputation among non-Asians, he took a bite of its sauce-drenched, crispy fried goodness with an open mind. He chewed through its golden barrier and into its moist, pillowy interior. Grunting his approval, he kept eating. That, ideally, is how you meet and greet tofu.      Most tofu virgins know it's out there. They've heard the stories of what this personality-free substance doesn't taste like. Unless their first bite is at a restaurant, their fears are likely confirmed. Statistically speaking, non- Asians do a poor job cooking tofu, my dad included.   He called tofu "bean curd," like you did back in the 1970s. He explained it was something I would be eating in place of meat, which I had recently sworn off at age 7 for ethical reasons.      Dad was a good cook, and while bean curd was not his strong suit, he made a well-researched attempt. I vividly remember its chalky, flaccid, absent presence.      His intentions were pure, but dad could not have devised a more effective way to change my mind about vegetarianism.      If dad had known then what I know now about freezing tofu, I might still be a vegetarian. But at least in my lifetime I have been able to finish what he started. I'm not referring to the fact that I have become one of those weirdos who likes raw, unseasoned tofu, but the fact that   I now know how to cook it like the pros.      This time of year, with so many new veggies in season, stir-fries are in play, and some proper tofu can make any stir-fry seem royal. But tofu's default state is lame and flavorless, characteristics that will carry through to the finished product unless you take measures. Namely, put your brick of firm tofu in the freezer for a few days.      That's mostly it, actually. That, and some cornstarch and sauce, and you're set.      It isn't law that you put golden cubes of crispy, meaty, succulent tofu into every stir-fry. It is, however, something of a tradition for a reason. And adding tofu doesn't mean skipping meat, depending on your inclinations. Tofu is great with every type of animal protein, from chicken to eggs to bacon to seafood.      There is a lot going on in a stir-fry, and it's easy to overlook the tofu, which would be a mistake. Just ask generations of disappointed tofu tasters. Or ask my son, who lights up for "restaurant tofu."      Restaurant tofu has a resilient, fleshy quality, a tasty brown skin that holds onto sauce, and a springy, moist interior. Tofu is mostly water, and when you freeze it that water expands, rupturing channels through the tofu as it tries to push its way out. Those channels will soon act as portals to allow in what we call "restaurant sauce." You can guess the kinds of restaurants we frequent from its recipe below.      I dust the saucy cubes with cornstarch and deep-fry them into golden blocks of joy that explode with flavor when you crunch through, like restaurant tofu should.      For a fun side dish, save the onions from the marinade, roll them in extra cornstarch, and deep fry into a tasty side, snack or garnish.      Marinated Restaurant Tofu   Serves 2   • 1 (12 oz.) brick firm or extra-firm tofu, frozen for at least three days, thawed overnight, squeezed of excess water and cut into ½-inch cubes   • 1 tablespoon each soy sauce, oyster sauce, rice vinegar   • 1 teaspoon each fish sauce, hoisin sauce, hot sauce, sesame oil, brown sugar   • ¼ teaspoon black pepper   • ¼ onion, sliced and teased apart   • 2 cloves garlic, minced   • 1 cubic inch ginger, peeled and sliced   • 2 cups vegetable oil   • 4 tablespoons cornstarch (more for onion ginger garlic fritter rings)      Mix all of the sauces, along with the onion, garlic, ginger, brown sugar and black pepper, and toss the tofu in the sauce. It will absorb every last drop.      Heat the vegetable oil to 350 degrees in a small, deep pan suitable for frying. While the oil is heating, toss the tofu cubes and cornstarch in a bowl until the tofu is coated. Save the onions for later.      Deep-fry the cubes 2 to 4 minutes, depending on how dark and crispy you want them. Remove and allow to drain and cool in a colander or on paper towels.   Toss the onion sections in the cornstarch, adding more if necessary, and then fry these onions in the hot oil. They take a bit longer to cook because of all of the water. Don't stir them. Let it fry into a 3D matrix.      If serving your tofu with a stir-fry, prepare the tofu first. Don't add to the stir-fry until serving time, or serve it on the side, ready to mix in.

The residents of Haveri district's Karjagi village hold an annual three-day fair around this time every year on the occasion of 'Kara Hunnime’, a festival to mark the end of summer and the beginning of monsoon. But this year, the organisers were denied permission by the police due to physical distancing norms in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. The tehsildar had also written to the Deputy Commissioner of Haveri on May 26, requesting that the procession should not be held since it would be difficult to follow distancing norms.
 Therefore, the organisers decided to forgo the festival this year, and instead hold a symbolic procession on Thursday evening to pay their respects to the Brahmalingeshwara deity. However, the small bullock cart procession to be attended only by the organising committee members quickly grew into a massive affair with thousands of devotees gathering at the venue in Karjagi village. Visuals of the event show the annual procession being attended by the village residents with hardly anyone wearing masks or maintaining physical distance.
 "A case has been registered against members of the fair's organising committee. We had discussed with the committee and asked them to refrain from celebrating the festival this year. The organising committee members were of the belief that they still wanted to go ahead and hold a fair symbolically with only the committee members present," says Haveri Superintendent of Police KG Devaraju.
 Even though prohibitory orders under section 144 of the CrPC (disallowing gathering of more than five people at a public place) were put in place, the annual festival attracted thousands of people from in and around Karjagi.
 "It is their age-old belief and it was very difficult to convince them of the dangers of the coronavirus outbreak and the need to follow physical distancing norms. We cannot treat this as a law and order problem and disperse the gathering using force. We can only appeal to them. But we will be initiating a case against the committee members now," KG Devaraju added.
 Haveri Rural Police have now booked 69 people under the Disaster Management Act, 2005 and the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897. "We will be writing to the judge and an enquiry will be conducted as per the judge's order," KG Devaraju said.
 The festival held annually in Karjagi village is attended by over 50,000 people according to police officials in the district.

Earlier, the charges were Rs 4,500 and Rs 5,200 respectively," he said.The revised rates are the maximum these labs can charge. District collectors can negotiate with private labs to reduce the rates further, Tope said."If the private labs charge more than the prescribed upper limit, legal action would be taken against them," he said, claiming that the new rates will be the lowest in the country.The minister said that at present, there are 91 labs in the state for COVID-19 testing and about four to five are in the pipeline.

In updates to their members this week, both the Ermineskin Cree Nation and the Samson Cree Nation urged residents to continue following provincial health guidelines as they look towards the future summer months.
 Neither Nation has had any recorded cases of COVID-19 since the pandemic was declared in mid-March.
 In a Facebook video Wednesday, Ermineskin Cree Nation (ECN) Chief Craig Makinaw reminded members of the daily 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. curfew which, in addition to the barricades into the reserve, could remain in place until October, 2020.
 "We must not be complacent in keeping our most vulnerable safe," Makinaw said. "The threat of this virus to our nation will be a part of our lives for some time yet to come."
 Mobile testing for COVID-19, both for symptomatic and asymptomatic members, was available throughout the week and will likely continue in the coming weeks.
 Some events, including the ECN cemetery feast on June 7 and the yard and garden contest (deadline June 30) will continue as planned.
 Lastly, Chief Makinaw issued a congratulations to the Nation's graduating class of 2020.
 "This is a tough year for your special day and you worked many years to see this day," he said. "The challenges you've faced during all of this will only make you stronger, more grounded and determined. The hopes and dreams you have for yourself will blaze a trail for all the rest that follow."
 On the Samson Cree Nation (SCN), Chief Vernon Saddleback and Harper Potts with emergency management issued similar sentiments during their Friday, June 5 Facebook update.
 "These kids graduated through one of the toughest times of their lives that they're ever going to see, through a pandemic, and yet were able to stay online, go to their classes online and now they're getting their diplomas," Potts said.
 An election announcement was also made Friday, as Saddleback noted dates have been determined for chief and council elections in July.
 The nomination deadline for chief is July 7 with the election occurring on July 12. Nominations for council must be in by July 21 with the election taking place on July 28.
 Details for the various locations, both on-reserve and in Calgary and Edmonton for off-reserve members, as well as digital or virtual voting possibilities are still in the works.
 With no cases of COVID-19 in Alberta's central zone, Saddleback urged members to be cautious and remain vigilant.
 "Please continue to be careful and diligent… wash your hands constantly," he said. "We're in to save our elders in the long run here. We're in this together."
 Potts added SCN is preparing for employees for re-entry on June 15 by "ensuring the safety procedures are in place for employees to get back to work."
 Food hamper delivery will also be starting again on the SCN on Wednesday and will likely be the last for the summer months "unless the second wave comes early."
 Makinaw at ECN also said the delivery of food hampers will start again next week, from June 8-12, and reminded members to ensure someone is home during the day to accept them and that dogs are tied up or secured inside to keep volunteers safe while completing the deliveries.

A series of studies in mice of Moderna Inc's Covid-19 lent some assurance that it may not increase the risk of more severe disease, and that one dose may provide protection against the novel coronavirus, according to preliminary data released on Friday.Prior studies on a vaccine for SARS - a close cousin to the new virus that causes Covid-19 - suggests vaccines against this type of virus might have the unintended effect of causing more severe disease when the vaccinated person is later exposed to the pathogen, especially in individuals who do not produce an adequately strong immune response. Scientists have seen this risk as a hurdle to clear before vaccines can be safely tested in thousands of healthy people.While the data released by the U.S. National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) and Moderna offered some assurance, the studies do not fully answer the question."This is the barest beginning of preliminary information," said Dr. Gregory Poland, an immunologist and vaccine researcher at the Mayo Clinic who has seen the paper, which has yet to undergo peer-review.Poland said the paper was incomplete, disorganized and the numbers of animals tested were small.The authors said they have submitted the work to a top-tier journal. Moderna's vaccine is in midstage testing in healthy volunteers. Moderna said on Thursday it plans to begin final-stage trials enrolling 30,000 people in July.In the animal studies, mice received one or two shots of a variety of doses of Moderna's vaccine, including doses considered not strong enough to elicit a protective immune response. Researchers then exposed the mice to the virus.Subsequent analyses suggest "sub-protective" immune responses do not cause what is known as vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease, a susceptibility to more severe disease in the lungs."Subprotective doses did not prime mice for enhanced immunopathology following (exposure)," Dr. Barney Graham of the Vaccine Research Center at NIAID and colleagues wrote in the manuscript, posted on the bioRxiv website.Further testing suggested the vaccine induces antibody responses to block the virus from infecting cells. The vaccine also appeared to protect against infection by the coronavirus in the lungs and noses without evidence of toxic effects, the team wrote.They noted the mice that received just one dose before exposure to the virus seven weeks later were "completely protected against lung viral replication," suggesting a single vaccination prevented the virus from replicating in the lungs. "At first glance, it looks promising in inducing neutralizing antibody protection in mice," Dr. Peter Hotez, a researcher at Baylor College of Medicine said in an email. He had not reviewed the paper in detail.Poland, who was not involved with the research, said the paper leaves out "important parameters" that could help scientists judge the work."The results, such as they are presented, provide interesting data that are reassuring ... This needs to be replicated and it needs to be peer-reviewed," he said.

The pursuit of perfection in tennis has proved beyond all but one player in the modern era, Germany's Steffi Graf.
 During her 17-year career Graf collected 22 Grand Slam singles titles and spent a record 377 weeks as world number one.
 Yet when reviewing Graf's impact on her sport, there is only one place to start -- 1988.
 It was the year a 19-year-old Graf won the Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, U.S. Open and Olympics. The Golden Slam.
 American Serena Williams now owns a modern-era record 23 Grand Slam singles titles and Roger Federer is, for many, the greatest player, man or woman, to wield a tennis racket.
 Neither have managed a year quite like that.
 Women's tennis for much of the 1980s was dominated by the iconic rivalry between Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert.
 A frizzy-haired girl from Mannheim had already begun turning heads in 1982 -- the year Graf debuted on the WTA Tour aged 13.
 By 1985 she was in the world's top 10 and in 1987 beat Navratilova to win the French Open.
 While so many teen upstarts at the time suffered burnout, Graf's all-round game, perfect tennis physique and mental stability ensured she would withstand the rigours of the sport.
 Her preference for a classic, underspin backhand was a nod to former greats, but a whiplash forehand and heavy serving, were tailor-made for the emerging power game.
 Graf began 1988 by winning the Australian Open without the loss of a set, beating Evert in the final. In the French Open final she thrashed unfortunate Russian teenager Natasha Zvereva 6-0 6-0 in 32 minutes -- the shortest Grand Slam final.
 Weeks later at Wimbledon "Fraulein Forehand", the moniker bestowed on her by tennis writer Bud Collins, dethroned Wimbledon queen Navratilova, reversing her 1987 final loss, before clinching the women's doubles title to boot.
 "This is the end of a chapter, passing the torch if you want to call it that," Navratilova remarked at the time.
 At the U.S. Open, Graf scythed through to the final where she beat elegant Argentine Gabriela Sabatini to become only the fifth player to complete the fabled 'calendar year' Grand Slam and the only player to do it on hard, clay and grass.
 Gordon Jorgensen, then president of the USTA, gave Graf a bracelet with four diamonds to mark her feat and a few weeks later in Seoul it was gold after beating Sabatini again in the Olympic singles final.
 With Evert retiring and Navratilova waning, Graf was totally dominant and would have won back-to-back Grand Slams had it not been for gritty Spaniard Arantxa Sanchez Vicario who beat her in the 1989 French Open final.
 Graf needed a natural rivalry and in the emergence of Yugoslav teenager Monica Seles she found one, and some.
 Seles, only 16, snapped Graf's 66-match winning streak by beating her in her own backyard at the 1990 German Open, and a few weeks later beat her again in the French Open final.
 In 1991-1992 Seles claimed six Grand Slam titles to Graf's two and also beat her in the 1993 Australian Open final. Sadly the rivalry came to an almost tragic end months later when a deranged fan stabbed Seles at a tournament in Hamburg.
 Graf won the remaining Slams in 1993 and also won three of the four in 1995 and 1996 before Martina Hingis emerged.
 Even when the inevitable slide began there was still one last flourish as Graf beat Hingis in a stormy 1999 French Open final, months before she retired, aged 30, to begin a new life with American great Andre Agassi whom she married in 2001.

The story of the S.S. Portland is one of the most tragic in New England maritime history. Heading from Boston to Portland, Maine, over Thanksgiving weekend, the steamer was caught in a hurricane-force storm in a raging sea off the Outer Cape, and was never heard from again. Nearly 200 people perished.
 However, this wasn't the first time that a steamer took this route. Nearly a half century earlier, some time between 1850 and 1855, the steamer St. Lawrence was taking the same route, only in the opposite direction.
 Like the Portland, the St. Lawrence was caught in a gale shortly after leaving port. Unlike the Portland, all but one of the 238 souls on board lived to tell about it.
 The Portland was driven out to sea by fierce winds, leaving her struggling near Provincetown before being overtaken by the waves. In the case of the St. Lawrence, it was more by choice that she ended up near Highland Light in Truro.
 Roughly four hours after leaving Portland, the St. Lawrence, captained by Cyrus Sturdivant, found herself caught up in heavy snow and high winds as night fell. By morning, the storm intensified, and Sturdivant and his crew "could not discover the points of land we desired," the captain wrote in his 1879 book, "Sketches of the Life and Work of Captain Cyrus Sturdivant."
 "The only safe and prudent alternative was for us to change the course of our steamer, and lay her off shore, head to the sea and storm, which was constantly increasing in roughness and fierceness."
 By this time, "there was terrible consternation and alarm among some of the passengers," Sturdivant recalled. One of the crewmen was ordered to secure a lifeboat that became loose, and in doing so, his foot slipped, and he fell overboard and was drowned; the sea being so rough and the storm so fierce that no earthly power could save him."
 The situation continued to worsen. The full load of cargo was tossed overboard to lighten the ship's load. The chief engineer told Sturdivant that the main steam pipe might give out and sought instructions on what to do. "Continue to do your duty as you always have done and we will all do the best we can, and so trust in God who holds the storms in his hands," the captain replied.
 The engineer went to the upper deck to attempt a fix. Like many others on board, he dropped to his knees and prayed for help. By evening, "we found ourselves six miles north of the highland of Cape Cod, thankful to God that the gale had become a calm, and so we were saved from finding a watery grave, or being dashed upon the rough shore of the Cape, from whence there would have been no escape," the captain wrote.
 The next day, the St. Lawrence made its way into Boston Harbor. While there was great relief among those on board that the steamer made it through the storm, Sturdivant was still obligated to break the news of the crewman's death to his family. "He whom they loved so well, and on whom they depended for earthly support, would be seen by them no more until the sea gives up its dead," Sturdivant wrote.
 Sturdivant continued to work for the Portland Steam Packet Company for several years, but "finding the life was producing unhealthy symptoms in my constitution, I was advised by my physician to procure and engage in some other other kind of business."
 For the rest of his life, the captain turned to working for the church.
 "Being a sailor, he knew how to cast his net on the right side of the Gospel ship," Francis Murphy wrote in the captain's book introduction. "To the astonishment of many who had fished all night without success, the captain had his net full."

Kalgoorlie mother Jannah Cooper reckons anyone who thinks Australia doesn't have a problem with racism must be sticking their heads in the sand.
 A white Australian with Aboriginal children, she sees it every day in the discrimination her two young sons face in a town still reeling from the death of Elijah Doughty.
 Four years ago, 14-year-old Elijah was riding a stolen dirt bike when he was run down and killed by its white owner near Kalgoorlie in Western Australia's Goldfields region.
 The man was charged but later acquitted of manslaughter and instead convicted of dangerous driving causing death.
 After serving half of a three-year jail term, he was freed on parole.
 "He was the same age as my oldest son when he died," Ms Cooper told AAP at Perth's Black Lives Matter protest.
 "I think Australians were very quick to point the finger at America for George Floyd's death and their treatment of black Americans, without recognising that we have our own issues in Australia with the brutality that Aboriginal people face at the hands of the justice system."
 Standing with her sons Jayvin, 14, and Ezekiel, 12, Ms Cooper said the boys were already well-versed on such issues.
 "They have been followed in shops ... they know when you go to a shop, get the receipt because you're going to be asked," she said.
 "They've had kids at parks tell them they don't want to play with them because they're brown.
 "My son was on a sporting team where the coach refused to shake his hand or congratulate him or even acknowledge his presence. As the only Aboriginal kid on the team, he was marked different in the way that he was treated."
 Wearing a shirt bearing the names of just a small number of the 432 Aboriginal people known to have died in custody over the past 30 years, Ms Cooper urged non-indigenous Australians to reflect on how they might be perpetuating racism.
 It might make the world a safer place for her sons, she said.
 "I know that as they get older, they move from being (seen as) cute little brown kids to being a threat to society," she said.
 "So I think enough's enough."

“I don’t want to use the word but PSL clubs should be forced to have women’s teams. And not just have a women’s team for the sake of having it, but give them support and the necessary development similar to what they are giving to their male counterparts. We will also see a huge shift in the mindset of people and sponsors will come on board,” she added.

Loyalty is key. Having made his national team debut in June 2005, Gaxa knew the ins and outs of Bafana. But it wasn’t his status that made him get the nod from the technical team. Instead his astute performances for Mamelodi Sundowns and SuperSport United, where he won a domestic treble, made him stand out.

The pursuit of perfection in tennis has proved beyond all but one player in the modern era, Germany's Steffi Graf.During her 17-year career Graf collected 22 Grand Slam singles titles and spent a record 377 weeks as world number one.Yet when reviewing Graf's impact on her sport, there is only one place to start -- 1988.It was the year a 19-year-old Graf won the Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, U.S. Open and Olympics. The Golden Slam. American Serena Williams now owns a modern-era record 23 Grand Slam singles titles and Roger Federer is, for many, the greatest player, man or woman, to wield a tennis racket.Neither have managed a year quite like that.Women's tennis for much of the 1980s was dominated by the iconic rivalry between Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert.A frizzy-haired girl from Mannheim had already begun turning heads in 1982 -- the year Graf debuted on the WTA Tour aged 13.By 1985 she was in the world's top 10 and in 1987 beat Navratilova to win the French Open.While so many teen upstarts at the time suffered burnout, Graf's all-round game, perfect tennis physique and mental stability ensured she would withstand the rigours of the sport.Her preference for a classic, underspin backhand was a nod to former greats, but a whiplash forehand and heavy serving, were tailor-made for the emerging power game.Graf began 1988 by winning the Australian Open without the loss of a set, beating Evert in the final. In the French Open final she thrashed unfortunate Russian teenager Natasha Zvereva 6-0 6-0 in 32 minutes -- the shortest Grand Slam final.Weeks later at Wimbledon "Fraulein Forehand", the moniker bestowed on her by tennis writer Bud Collins, dethroned Wimbledon queen Navratilova, reversing her 1987 final loss, before clinching the women's doubles title to boot."This is the end of a chapter, passing the torch if you want to call it that," Navratilova remarked at the time.At the U.S. Open, Graf scythed through to the final where she beat elegant Argentine Gabriela Sabatini to become only the fifth player to complete the fabled 'calendar year' Grand Slam and the only player to do it on hard, clay and grass.Gordon Jorgensen, then president of the USTA, gave Graf a bracelet with four diamonds to mark her feat and a few weeks later in Seoul it was gold after beating Sabatini again in the Olympic singles final.With Evert retiring and Navratilova waning, Graf was totally dominant and would have won back-to-back Grand Slams had it not been for gritty Spaniard Arantxa Sanchez Vicario who beat her in the 1989 French Open final.Graf needed a natural rivalry and in the emergence of Yugoslav teenager Monica Seles she found one, and some.Seles, only 16, snapped Graf's 66-match winning streak by beating her in her own backyard at the 1990 German Open, and a few weeks later beat her again in the French Open final.In 1991-1992 Seles claimed six Grand Slam titles to Graf's two and also beat her in the 1993 Australian Open final. Sadly the rivalry came to an almost tragic end months later when a deranged fan stabbed Seles at a tournament in Hamburg.Graf won the remaining Slams in 1993 and also won three of the four in 1995 and 1996 before Martina Hingis emerged.Even when the inevitable slide began there was still one last flourish as Graf beat Hingis in a stormy 1999 French Open final, months before she retired, aged 30, to begin a new life with American great Andre Agassi whom she married in 2001.

The beautiful picture is captured by Gaurav Agrawal at St Mary Lake in Glacier National Park, Montana back in 2019, reports the BBC.
 He took the image using his Nikon camera and later edited it using a software called Lightroom. It's during the editing that a bug crept into the image which is now causing android phones of some brands to fail. The glitch makes the devices turn off and on repeatedly. It's only the factory reset option, which means deleting all of one's stored data, that solves the issue.
 "I didn't do anything intentionally," Agrawal told the BBC. "I'm sad that people ended up having issues," he added.
 "I hoped my photograph would have gone 'viral' for a good reason, but maybe that's for another time," he said.
