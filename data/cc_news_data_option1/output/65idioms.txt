As tensions between the United States and Iran continue to ramp up, social media buzzed with talk of the draft. Many feared--or joked about--being drafted into a potential war with Iran.
 The U.S. is not currently in a direct armed conflict with Iran. However, the increase in tensions have led social media users, pundits and politicians alike to worry about the possibility of such a thing occurring down the road.

In a Kuzma-for-Bogdanovic deal, their salaries don’t match. Kuzma is owed $1.97 million this season, while Bogdanovic is owed $8.53 million in salary. The Lakers would have to cobble together roughly another $4.5 million in salaries to be able to do a deal, which seems hard to do without taking another key piece of the rotation. There is a $1.75 million trade exception for DeMarcus Cousins that helps. Quinn Cook is owed $3 million at the moment, which gets you there on paper, but given that he’s not playing at the moment, it’s hard to gauge how Sacramento would value him as an asset. It’s relevant that Sam Amick added to his report, “filler salary is of no interest to the Kings.”

Kvelertak have released a music video for their new single "Crack Of Doom," which features a guest appearance from Mastodon star Troy Sanders.
 The track comes from their forthcoming album "Splid", which is set for release on February 14th and the song is one of the band's very first performed in English.
 The band had this to say about the track, "Ever heard of the Maya Apocalypse? Johannes Stoffler? Harold Camping? Are you afraid that the religious leaders, scientists, or the doomsday preachers may be right?
 "Have no fear! They were all wrong. But now, Kvelertak has come to prophesize Ragnarok, straight into your heart and soul. The Crack of Doom shines on us all!"      They also had this to say about recruiting Sanders for the song, "We sent Troy a demo of the song because there were a couple of parts we felt would fit his voice very well and lift the song.
 "Luckily, he liked the track and was keen to do it. He got some scratch vocal tracks and some guidelines but was free to do it however he wanted. What we got back was even better than what we could hope for.
 "We're extremely proud to have him featured on this song, and with Troy being American, it felt natural to just do the whole thing in English."      Stian and Lars also had this to say about the Stian Andersen directed video, "It has been an amazing experience and a privilege to assist in the baptism of Ivar Nikolaisen into the ranks of the band, and putting him through the torturous conditions of ice bathing in sub-zero temperatures, setting him on fire, galloping through the forest shirtless mid-winter, or hanging him upside down from a tree."

To my eyes, however, the key allure of the Ori is using it in full-screen mode, like a large tablet. There are no detents in the Ori's hinge, which means that you can adjust it at virtually infinite angles to ensure that everything on the screen is easily viewable while you're sitting at your desk or even reclining on a couch.      The Concept Ori's operating system still isn't quite ready for demonstration; I didn't get free reign to make a window full-screen and scroll through its contents. Software improvements will be critical to the Concept Ori's success, but a lot depends on Microsoft and other companies, who must modify their apps to adapt to a new form factor. For its part, Microsoft is already developing a new version of Windows called Windows 10 X for foldable and dual-screen PCs, but getting smaller developers on board to develop foldable or dual-screen apps may still prove challenging.

Police said Doyle, who stands 6-feet, 6-inches tall and weighs 245 pounds, left the woman along a path in a wooded area behind the South Lawrence East School on Crawford Street, police said.
 During the attack the woman managed to kick Doyle in the genitals after which “he choked her” and during questioning admitted he held his hands around her neck “too long,” a prosecutor said.
 The woman was left with black eyes, strangulation marks on her neck and fractured orbital sockets, authorities said.
 Seriously injured, she awoke on the path several hours later in the early morning darkness. She was “soaked to the bone and alone” but started screaming and was able to alert area residents who called 911, Police Lt. Mark Ciccarelli said previously.
 During the lengthy investigation, the woman repeatedly met with detectives to go over the incident and provide information.
 Detectives Purpora and Aliano spent months pouring through private and public surveillance video and applying for and obtaining search warrants for digital and cell-phone evidence that linked Doyle to the assault, said Ciccarelli, noting the process was “painstaking” and “very lengthy.”

Though 2020 is already shaping up to be the year of the foldable PC, there are still many unknowns. What will durability and reliability be like, especially in the wake of the delays and reliability issues that plagued early Galaxy Fold phones? The Concept Ori's hinge (shown above) still looks rather primitive at this stage, even though it feels reasonably sturdy when you open and close it.      Battery life and processing power are just as important as durability. Intel and Qualcomm are the most likely candidates to supply a CPU to power foldable PCs like the Concept Ori. Microsoft's own similar Surface Neo and Surface Duo concepts will use an Intel chip still under development, code-named "Lakefield." Its benefits include a hybrid architecture that fits both the CPU and the graphics-processing cores onto a single 12mm-square package. Lakefield is also a likely candidate to power Concept Ori in its more mature form.      Dell's concept is more than half of the way to market, but it's taken a long time to get here. The second half of the journey, especially the necessary software improvements, will likely be difficult and continue long after the first device goes on sale. That will make the Ori and other devices like it, when and if they _do_ hit the market, worth buying for only the most dedicated proponents of owning bleeding-edge hardware.

“Trump demolished the chance for any sort of possible agreement between Tehran and Washington,” Rashidi said. “There will be more conflict in the future for sure.”
 Ghaani made his own threat in an interview shown Monday on Iranian state television. “God the Almighty has promised to get his revenge, and God is the main avenger. Certainly actions will be taken,” he said.
 Ghaani, a longtime Soleimani deputy, has taken over as the head of the Revolutionary Guard’s Quds, or Jerusalem, Force, answerable only to Khamenei. Ghaani has been sanctioned by the U.S. since 2012 for his work funding its global operations, including its work with proxies in Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen.
 Those proxies likely will be involved in any operation targeting U.S. interests in the Middle East or elsewhere.
 Already, the U.S. Embassy in Saudi Arabia warned Americans “of the heightened risk of missile and drone attacks.” In Lebanon, the leader of the Iranian- backed militant group Hezbollah said Soleimani’s killing made U.S. military bases, warships and service members across the region fair game for attacks.
 The head of the Guard’s aerospace program, Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh, suggested Iran’s response wouldn’t stop with a single attack.
 “Firing a couple of missiles, hitting a base or even killing Trump is not valuable enough to compensate for martyr Soleimani’s blood,” Hajizadeh said on state TV. “The only thing that can compensate for his blood is the complete removal of America from the region.”

MEMPHIS -- Lt. Col. James Williams has something better than a bucket list.
   
 "I don't like the word 'bucket list' because it makes it feel like you're getting ready to die," said the North Memphis native and Vietnam War veteran. "I call it my 'living list.' "
   
 Williams completed a significant piece of that list in November, when he and other veterans returned to Hanoi, Vietnam, to gain closure from their time at war. North Vietnamese forces captured Williams after his jet was shot down in May 1972 and held him prisoner until March 1973.
   
 "The whole purpose, in a nutshell, was it being a healing mission to put us back in that environment," said Williams, 75, of the trip organized by the Valor Administration, Vietnam-USA Friendship members and North Vietnamese combat veterans.
   
 What Williams didn't know ahead of time was he would meet the widow of the North Vietnamese pilot who shot his jet down. Through Nguyen Thi Lam, he learned more about her late husband, Do Van Lanh.
   
 Williams felt uneasy when he first met her. Once they started talking through an interpreter, that tension began to fade and Williams found some closure. Lam shared pictures of Lanh, and she said she was sorry it had to be her husband who shot Williams down.
   
 "That kind of broke the ice a bit," Williams said.
   
 Williams, a Douglass High School graduate and Tennessee State University alum, was soon to wrap up his tour when his F-4D Phantom fighter jet got shot down on May 20, 1972. He was part of the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy's bombing campaign against North Vietnam known as Operation Linebacker I.
   
 "It was air-to-air engagement," Williams said. "That particular day, there were 40 days left on my tour. In fact, I was on my 228th combat mission."
   
 His jet hit by a missile from Lanh, Williams was forced to eject and North Vietnamese forces captured him. He ended up imprisoned at Hoa Lo Prison, or the "Hanoi Hilton," for 313 days.
   
 Williams endured solitary confinement and around-the-clock interrogation. He said they tried to break him down for information, while he stuck with his created story that he was only on his 12th combat mission and had been in the country for just three weeks. Williams was finally released on March 28, 1973, after the war's end.
   
 Williams spent 28 years in the military, retiring from service in 1995. He then launched an Air Force Junior ROTC program in a Georgia school system, where he taught for 20 years. Today, Williams is on the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs POW Advisory Committee.
   
 Earlier this year, Williams connected with a Valor Administration representative who notified him of the trip to Vietnam, a golden opportunity to complete part of his living list.
   
 "Some of the guys kept saying, 'Have you told Colonel what we plan on doing?' " Williams said. "The plan for me was to meet the pilot who shot me down, but he passed away in 1980, so they had me meet his wife."
   
 Beyond meeting Lam and many veterans on the North Vietnamese side, Williams got to experience how much Hanoi had changed since he left as a just-released prisoner of war in 1973. The mental picture he kept -- a landscape altered by bombings -- was replaced by its transformation into a modern city.
   
 "It was something that I wanted to do but didn't think I would have the opportunity to do," Williams said.

McCarthy's up-tempo approach will simplify things for Prescott, as defenses will be forced to play just two or three coverages (Cover 2, Cover 3 or man coverage) at most. Prescott will constantly have open receivers, with Zeke demanding attention in the backfield and his receivers (a group that includes 2019 breakout stud Michael Gallup) often facing man-to-man coverage. Prescott will also have more control at the line of scrimmage with the freedom to check certain plays or signal receivers to run certain routes pre-snap, making it extremely tough on defenses. Prescott's inconsistencies across the board -- from decision-making to throwing accuracy to executing the offense with confidence -- should improve in this attack.

 However, an IWF hotline manager - who wished to be identified only as "Chris" - said the charity is receiving too many false reports, which cost £150,500 in 2018.
 "Whilst we actively encourage people to report to us content within our remit because it helps us do a good job, actually, far too many people are wasting our time," he said.
 "Our analysts have to look at everything they're sent.
 "So, our message is, yes, please report to us, but please, please stop reporting material outside our remit."
 In December, the charity announced that it would work with a US counterpart - the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) - to create the biggest database of hashed child abuse images in the world.
 Hashing is a form of digital fingerprint which allows an image to be identified the moment someone attempts to upload it.
 A Home Office spokesman said: "Child sexual abuse is an abhorrent crime and predators who share or view indecent images of children are complicit in this horrific abuse and can expect the full weight of the law to come down on them.
 "We are bringing forward ground-breaking legislation to protect the public from online harms, including children and the most vulnerable users and make the UK the safest place in the world to be online."

PHILADELPHIA -- Recently unveiled letters from T.S. Eliot to his muse Emily Hale show how much he loved his longtime friend, but a statement from beyond the grave by the poet himself dismisses his feelings and shows how Eliot tries to rewrite the narrative of their relationship, scholars say.
   
 Hale donated Eliot's letters to Princeton University Library more than 60 years ago with instructions that they could only be opened 50 years after she and Eliot died.
   
 The day they were made available at the Ivy League school, Eliot's statement, written five years before his death, was released -- as per his own instructions.
   
 In it, Eliot downplays his love for Hale.
   
 "I came to see that my love for Emily was the love of a ghost for a ghost," he wrote.
   
 Eliot scholar Frances Dickey, who was among the first to read the letters at the New Jersey school Thursday, said it was "unfortunate" that Eliot felt he had to deny his feelings for Hale.
   
 "That seemed a little harsh," Dickey said. "She was his muse for many years."
   
 Letters to Hale from 1930 -- contained in the first of 14 boxes -- show Eliot confessing his love for her.
   
 "They are extremely passionate," Dickey said. "It's really more than what I expected. They are very emotional, claiming that she inspired a lot of his poetry. She obviously played a really important role in his poetic life."
   
 Dickey said it's become more obvious that the "hyacinth girl" in "The Waste Land," Eliot's most famous poem, is Hale.
   
 Also among the boxes of letters is a manuscript Hale wrote about their relationship. Her account and his early letters trace the same narrative, Dickey said.
   
 In his statement, Eliot does admit he once loved Hale.
   
 "I fell in love with Emily Hale in 1912," he wrote. He told her so two years later.
   
 "I have no reason to believe, from the way in which this declaration was received, that my feelings were returned," Eliot wrote.
   
 He married his first wife, Vivienne Haigh-Wood, in 1915, a year after his declaration. The two had a tumultuous, loveless marriage marred by Haigh- Wood's mental illness and alleged infidelity. They separated in 1933.
   
 "Emily Hale would have killed the poet in me; Vivienne nearly was the death of me, but she kept the poet alive," Eliot wrote.
   
 Hale eventually developed feelings for Eliot, but the poet writes that, as time went on, he realized "more and more how little Emily Hale and I had in common."
   
 "It may be too harsh, to think that what she liked was my reputation rather than my work," he wrote.
   
 Eliot scholar Anthony Cuda called that a "cold and untrue statement."
   
 "He pursued her," he said. "His earliest letters were ardent declarations of love. It's not as if she chased after him."
   
 In other letters, Eliot comments on the pain and happiness of intimacy, according to Dickey, and even confesses his craving for alcohol and reveals details about his private life.
   
 Hundreds of letters still need to be read; only a few copies can be seen at a time at the library, and there are no copies available online.
   
 There are a few different reasons Eliot might be trying to rewrite history, the scholars say. Hale donated the letters while the two were still alive, and Eliot feared they might be released before the embargo date. Eliot had ordered the letters he'd received from Hale destroyed.
   
 "He was looking back on this and felt embarrassed and ashamed at the openness and vulnerability he allowed to come through at the time," Cuda said. "He tried to do damage control."
   
 But he also wanted to protect his second wife , Valerie, whom he calls his one true love.
   
 "But it's a strange protectiveness," Cuda said. "He was so devoted to Valerie and she to him. What the Emily Hale letters reveal -- (Valerie) wasn't the unique love of his life. He had a unique and tense experience before her."
   
 The letters could reveal much more about Eliot's private and poetic life and are already making waves among the literary community. Cuda called them "all we could have hoped for."
   
 "What we want to do as consumers of the lives of others is simply understand them," he said. "As usual, Eliot won't be simplified."

New York Jewish neighborhoods are on edge following a number of assaults on Jews over Chanukah, as well as the recent deadly attack in Jersey City and a stabbing incident in Monsey. Police patrols have been increased in the Brooklyn neighborhoods of Boro Park, Crown Heights and Williamsburg, which have seen recent attacks. Asked whether the increased patrols will be the new normal or will be pulled back soon, de Blasio replied, "As long as we were dealing with a crisis, that capacity will be applied to address the crisis. Obviously, we all want this crisis to end. We all want to get to the normal we had before. That's the normal I believe in, where people could in this city, of all cities on the earth, that anybody of any background could walk the streets in peace, anybody of any faith could exhibit the symbols of their faith and peace, and certainly the Jewish community after thousands of years of oppression. I think it would be safe to say this is one of the places in the history of the world the Jewish community found the most refuge, the most support, the most peace. We want to restore that reality 110%. Until we're certain that is the case, that unit will be applied to the areas where the need is greatest."

Throughout a season, St. Thomas More girls basketball coach Stephen Strojny has always coached his team with what he refers to as an “ascending model.”
 It’s starts with breaking the season down into three parts — pre-district, district and then the postseason — which is not uncommon among high school coaches in various sports. The goal is to peak at the right time.
 But what’s different about Strojny’s philosophy is that he does things “strategically” to build toward the postseason. The Lady Cougars may lose games in the first third of the season, but that’s fine by Strojny as long as they’re getting better in some facet of the game in those losses, like man-to- man defense.
 Especially with so many multi-sport athletes on STM’s roster — 20 or the 23 players on this year’s team play at least two sports — building depth and becoming a well-rounded team in the early part of the season is what’s most important to Strojny.
 In reality, the steady progression starts in the summer.
 “We play a lot of teams during the summer that beat us by 35 points, and we play them during the season and we beat them,” Strojny said. “Or early in the season, they beat us by 20, and then we play them again later in the season and beat them.
 “I’ve learned from some coaches I’ve been fortunate enough to work with that there definitely is a system or a strategy to ensure that you’re peaking at the right time, and sometimes that involves being patient. Sometimes that involves losing some games. Sometimes that involves playing a lot of kids and making sure you have your legs.”
 It’s hard to argue with Strojny’s methods when you look at the results. In six of the eight years he’s coached the Lady Cougars, they’ve beaten a team seeded higher than them at some point in the playoffs.
 It would hardly be a shock if STM pulled off another upset in 2020 with Strojny returning four of his five starters from last year’s squad that reached the quarterfinals, which the program has done 22 of the last 23 years.
 The Lady Cougars currently sit at 11-6 on the year and have won four of their last five games, including a pair of wins during a tournament in Orlando.
 “Our girls are used to winning,” Strojny said. “The expectation is to win. The expectation is to get to the playoffs and try to figure out a way to upset the higher seed. Most people that looked at the box score of our (quarterfinal) game against (eventual Division II champion) Lee Magnet last year saw that they ended up beating us pretty bad. But it was an eight-point game in the third quarter. We had them on the ropes until it got away from us at the end.”
 STM will have an opportunity to show its improvement against a team it lost to earlier in the season when it travels to Iota on Tuesday. The Lady Bulldogs beat the Lady Cougars 50-47 on Dec. 12.
 Although STM’s roster features only three seniors, ten players routinely get playing time for the Lady Cougars, including sophomores Sophie Perkins, Annelise Davis and Izzy Carter. The lineup is highlighted by juniors Angelle Doucet and Claire Hader, who led STM in scoring in their most recent win against Vermilion Catholic and have been the most consistent offensive players, Strojny said.
 But scoring often comes from a number of sources, the coach said, and senior Caroline McDaniel is the team’s “glue girl.” Emily LeBlanc, a junior, has also “turned the corner” as a player, Strojny said.
 “We’re definitely not a one-man show,” Strojny said. “I think we’ve had seven or eight kids score double-digits this year. It’s nice to have some depth, especially on the girls side. When I coached the boys, it’s essential to have depth if you want to play fast. This is the first year we’ve been able to play 8-10 kids and have a full freshmen, JV and varsity roster. It’s been enjoyable.”
 Hader, along with classmate Olivia Guidry, has also driven the team defensively.
 “Claire is our defensive engine, and Olivia is our defensive steering wheel,” Strojny said. “If you look at our schedule, we’ve been in every single game we’ve lost. Even against Lake Arthur (a 57-35 defeat), they got up on us 16-0. But then from that point on, it was a one or two-point game.”
 The play of the defense has been particularly noteworthy this season considering the Lady Cougars, traditionally a zone team under Strojny, have switched to using man-to-man more exclusively. That came after a district loss to Teurlings at home last year, a game Strojny felt his team should have won.
 “My good friend, (New Iberia coach Todd Russ), he’s probably the best man-to- man coach around,” Strojny said. “I spent some time talking to him, and he’s like, ‘If you’re ever going to make a run at some point, you got to be able to play man-to-man.’ So we committed to it about a year ago, and it still hasn’t been a calendar year since that loss. But we’ve really bought into it.
 “We’re starting to see the fruits of it because there’s been a couple of games this year that we shouldn’t have won that we won just because we were able to wear teams down defensively. There’s been games that we probably should have lost by a lot more than we did because our defense kept us in it.”

True stories that are turned into Hollywood films are a dime a dozen these days, and they often come across as heavy-handed accounts brimming with messages that practically scream out that their subjects are important. The story being told in "Just Mercy" is true and, focusing on racism in the American South in the 1980s and 90s, yet still painfully relevant today, is as important as it gets.      The difference between "Just Mercy" and so many others (that will remain unnamed here) that relentlessly hit viewers over the head with that message is that this one is written, directed, and acted with grace rather than excess, and the result is that it's both memorable and moving and very effective.      It's Alabama in the mid-1980s. An 18-year-old white woman has been murdered, and there's no suspect to be found. For the sole reason that he was a black man, considered to be an insignificant citizen, the innocent Walter "Johnny D" McMillian (Jamie Foxx) was nabbed, arrested, and eventually put on death row.      A couple of years later, Bryan Stevenson (Michael B. Jordan), fresh out of Harvard Law School, moved to Alabama to start up and become executive director of the Equal Rights Initiative (ERI), an organization dedicated to helping low income people on death row.      Based on Stevenson's 2014 memoir "Just Mercy: A story of Justice and Redemption," the film pulls no punches in its condemnation of racism, not only in the treatment of everyday black citizens in the South, but also the people fighting the fight. When Stevenson first visits a local prison, he's ordered to undergo a strip search, until a stern guard admits the demand was a joke, albeit an extremely offensive one.      The belief he picks up from one of his death row clients is that "a black man down here doesn't stand a chance" of justice. But Stevenson knows the law, and even though he's fresh out of school, he knows his stuff, and he's determined to make a difference. But he has no idea how difficult and frustrating the McMillian case is going to be. And his goals are not helped by the defeatist attitude of the long-suffering and hopeless McMillian, who bitterly says of the people who framed and intend to see him executed, "They can do whatever they want."      Though the story is mostly about these two men, there are other characters making notable contributions in the telling of it. Eva Ansley (Brie Larson, in a small, supporting role) runs ERI with Stevenson, and is soon the target of death threats just for being there. Ralph Myers (Tim Blake Nelson) is another prisoner, and the State's key witness against McMillian, who might have lied about him to save his own neck. Tommy Chapman (Rafe Spall) is a snake of a District Attorney. Herb Richardson (Rob Morgan) is another death row inmate, one who feels his time is about up.      There's a lot of anger and exasperation in the film, but some of it is buffered by a bit of nicely placed banter between prisoners in their cells, who can't see each other but can talk all they want. The script works its way to a couple of unusually low-key but consequential courtroom scenes that allow the drama to really pick up, and give Jordan a chance to strut his stuff - in a cool and calm manner - with one of those lofty, obligatory Hollywood courtroom speeches. Before they're over, those scenes become anything but low- key. But the characters of Stevenson and McMillian - ably aided by the actors portraying them - remain dignified throughout.      A nice touch that, since both Michael B. Jordan and the real Bryan Stevenson are on board as executive producers, is likely true, is the presentation of a couple of white prison guards as well meaning, caring people instead of going the typical movie route of portraying all of them as villains. If the film can be reduced to being about any one thing it's about the arduous pursuit of justice.      Ed Symkus writes about movies for More Content Now. He can be reached at esymkus@rcn.com.

Boeing said that it would halt production of its best-selling jet in January, 2020. In the spring of 2019, Boeing slowed production of its Max and caused some suppliers to adjust its workforce plans. With a stoppage of production, experts cited in a New York Times piece note it could have a devastating impact for manufacturers of parts if it lasts more than a month.

Congressman Jeff Van Drew, R-2nd, made national news in his freshman year in Congress, which he started as a Democrat and ended as a Republican.
 Long known as a moderate in the state Assembly and Senate, many thought Van Drew would continue to be a solid Democrat who occasionally deviated from the party on issues like gun rights, after he was elected in 2018 to fill the seat of longtime Congressman Frank LoBiondo, a moderate Republican.
 But right from the start, Van Drew set himself apart by voting "no" for Nancy Pelosi for Speaker -- fulfilling a campaign promise but confusing those on the House floor. He was supposed to call out a name of someone for speaker, so his "no" vote was recorded as "present."
 Then he was one of the few Democrats calling for bipartisan compromise on a budget to end what became the longest federal government shutdown in history. Later, he visited the southern border and came back saying there was, indeed, a crisis there. He supported both some funding for a border wall, and increased funding for housing and services to undocumented migrants. Van Drew was also one of just two Demcorats to first vote against proceeding with an impeachment inquiry, and to vote against both articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump.
 And on Dec. 19, 2019, he announced his party change to Republican while sitting next to Trump in the Oval Office.

Here's a shocking truth. Over the past decade, 23,000 sewage spills have occurred in Florida. As a result, 1.6 billion gallons of wastewater have been released to the environment (either into waterways or onto land) due the failure of aging sewer pipes, lift stations and wastewater treatment plants.
   
 More than 370 million gallons of that number were completely untreated. It's just one of Florida's obvious environmental problems demanding attention.
   
 Just ask the residents of Fort Lauderdale. During the 16 days prior to Christmas, three major sewer pipe failures poured an un-calculated amount of raw sewage, probably millions of gallons, into streets and water bodies. An emergency bypass stopped the leakage into the Rio Vista River, but arresting the sewage leaking into the Himmarshee Canal took longer.
   
 Even when aging sewer systems do not catastrophically fail, they still leak or exfiltrate. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates 10-17% of raw sewage leaks directly into the environment and groundwater from aging sewer pipes.
   
 In Florida, 1.5 billion gallons of wastewater are treated EVERY DAY. That's 534 billion gallons of wastewater each year. Just 10% of that results in 53.4 billion gallons of raw sewage annually entering the environment and groundwater.
   
 And, that isn't all. Aging sewer pipes infiltrate. When rains are heavy, stormwater infiltrates and overloads sewer pipes, overwhelming lift stations and treatment plant capacities.
   
 Municipal plants have no choice but to dump untreated or partially treated sewage into the environment or risk catastrophic damage to the facility. Infiltration is responsible for spewing additional tens of millions of gallons of sewage onto the ground and into streets and waterways.
   
 Failures, exfiltration and infiltration all demand attention as hazardous to health and the environment. Our ground and surface waters are being polluted right before us. And, it doesn't require a "Blue-Green Algae" Task Force to recognize that age and neglect are polluting our water and environment.
   
 The Coalition for Property Rights look for solutions and recently visited the city of Brooksville, which is renovating its sewer pipe system. Using processes such as smoke detection to identify leaks, video observation to prioritize the worst leaks, and a process called Cured-In-Place-Pipe, their pipes and manholes are being re-lined from within.
   
 It prevents exfiltration and infiltration, not to mention preventing failure. This rehabilitation project also eases the stress on the wastewater treatment plant during heavy rain events. Estimated cost of the project: $8,545,841.
   
 The Florida Keys has taken dramatic action. After a disastrous experimentation with so-called "advanced" or nitrogen-reducing septic systems, Monroe County has been upgrading their wastewater treatment plants to Advance Wastewater Treatment plants (AWTs).
   
 These AWTs remove bacteria and 97 percent or more of nutrients. Treated effluent is then put into injection wells 3,200 feet below the surface. Estimated capital cost to connect residents and businesses to AWTs is $1 billion.
   
 Two-thirds of Florida residences and businesses are serviced by sewer systems. Additionally, more than 100 million visitors use our sewer systems each year. And, in light of a projected 6 million new residents coming to Florida over the next few years, rehabilitation and capacity upgrades of our sewer systems cry out for action.
   
 Florida has spent billions on Everglades restoration. Additional millions are spent on the acquisition of conservation lands. But if wastewater never makes it to a treatment plant due to failing pipes, and if treatment plants put nutrient-rich effluent right back into our waters and environment, or the plants lack capacity during rain events and power outages, what difference will it make?
   
 Florida needs to fix this growing problem looming right in front of our noses. And the residents of Fort Lauderdale are reminded of it with every breath they take.

Bell had hoped not to define Iglesias exclusively as a closer, but rather as someone who can take on the most important high-leverage moments in any inning. That did not pan out, as Iglesias largely struggled in non-save situations while going 3-12 with a 4.16 ERA and 34 saves. Lorenzen and Garrett established themselves as solid righty and lefty setup men, respectively. After multiple struggles over the years, Stephenson appeared to turn the corner and became a more dependable reliever in the middle to late innings. Still, this is an area where the front office will have to make some investment next season after the overall bullpen took a step backward from 2018.

Shane Greene’s trade last July and Blaine Hardy’s departure last month leave a very unproven group after closer Jiménez and setup man Farmer, but it also presents an opportunity. Soto, Rony Garcia and Schreiber represent the Tigers’ best attempt to produce a bullpen in-house in several years, not counting Jiménez's rise. Soto, who had a very good winter ball season in the Dominican, could be critical in lefty relief as baseball transitions to a three-batter minimum. Bryan Garcia could be in position for a breakout in his second year back from Tommy John surgery. Wilson, back on a non-roster invite, could fill the do-everything role Drew VerHagen handled capably down the stretch last year.

Former Iron Maiden frontman Paul Di'Anno has explained the circumstances surrounding his decision that he no longer wanted to be in the band.
 Di'Anno was the lead singer for the legendary band on their first two studio album, their self-titled debut and then their sophomore record "Killers" before being replaced by Bruce Dickinson.
 Paul discussed his departure from the band during a recent interview with Eonmusic. He recalled, "I'll tell you what it was. The second album, I like the album and I liked it a lot, but it didn't have as much impact on me as the first album. Some of the songs on there were a bit... and I couldn't give 100% of myself, which was not fair on the band, on the fans, or on me.
 "And yeah, I was trying to find other ways to make if exciting for me when I was on the road, and yeah, there was a few problems with a bit of cocaine now and again. It wasn't as bad as what most people say it is - it was nothing like that.
 "But no, all it is at the end of the day is, when you've got such a fantastic working machine like Iron Maiden, if one little cog goes a bit wrong, the whole thing falls to bits, and I wasn't prepared for Maiden to go through that, and I wasn't prepared for me to go through it as well.
 "So, I sort of mentioned that I was unhappy, we had a little chat and all that, and that was it. We all sort of parted ways amicably."
