Raised in the Lincoln Park neighborhood, she was drawn to her profession due to having family members with dyslexia. She attended Sacred Heart Academy and later earned degrees in learning disabilities and behavioral therapy from Northeastern Illinois University.
 She then trained teachers in the Peace Corps in Tunisia, taught in the Chicago public school system for a time and now sees individual clients in private practice and consults for the Park Ridge School District. She and her husband, environmental engineer Tony Mueller, have two kids in college and one high schooler still at home.
 Her career had been spent in the company of youngsters between first grade through high school but that was not Andre. He would be her first adult client. Mueller quickly made a diagnosis and “was ready to go the distance with him.”
 There are many types of learning disabilities and Andre has what is known as phonological dyslexia, which makes it difficult to segment individual sounds from printed language and to spell those sounds into print. People with dyslexia have no trouble producing and processing the sounds they need to speak. Learning to do so is one of the first steps children must take learning to read, decoding words by sounding them out one letter or group of letters at a time.
