 GALESBURG-Each year hundreds of children enter Knox, Warren, Henderson, McDonough and Fulton Counties' juvenile court system due to abuse or neglect. CASA of West Central Illinois is looking for volunteers to advocate for these children.
 CASA stands for Court Appointed Special Advocates and is a small non-profit agency that trains volunteers to speak up for the best interests of children affected by abuse and neglect in Knox, Warren, Henderson, McDonough, and Fulton Counties' legal and child welfare system.
 CASA volunteers are appointed by judges to make sure these vulnerable children do not get lost in the legal and social service system or languish in an inappropriate group or foster home. Any adult (age 21) who completes the screening requirements and initial training sessions may become an advocate.
 The training classes are held quarterly. The next session begins in February.
 If you are interested in volunteering, please contact their office by phone (309) 343-4299 or email srobison@casaofwestcentralillinois.com.
 More information can also be found on their website www.casaofknoxco.com.

So, that range is just strictly coincidental. And as you know, the change in fair value, there's a number of components that go into that. But one big thing that will be different David is like in our prior years' gross profit; you would typically see from Q1 to Q4 either a pretty flat gross profit level or a declining gross profit level. You will not see that in net revenue. I would expect all things being equal going forward. So even with that margin that we're putting out to you, you'll see a little bit more lift as that comes down into EBITDA which is how you can see our EBITDA margins are a little bit stronger than what you've historically seen under incurred accounting.

Or is that still, some of it has to happen down the road, as more of this excess capacity comes out of the market?

MOUNT PLEASANT -- Steve Williamson was your typical college student during his days at Iowa Lakes Community College in Ellsworth.
 Williamson, who played guard at Ruthven High School, was playing basketball for the Lakers. But like many college students, he was trying to muddle through each day with no real goal in sight.
 That all changed when his coach at Iowa Lakes sat him down and suggested he should consider getting into coaching.
 After graduating from Iowa Wesleyan University, Williamson did just that. He played for former Iowa Wesleyan men's coach Alan Magnani, then joined his staff as an assistant coach.
 When the head coaching position for the Iowa Wesleyan women's basketball team came open, Williamson made the switch and embarked on a remarkable 13-year run of success with the Tigers, one which earned him a spot in the Iowa Wesleyan Athletics Hall of Fame.
 Williamson is now in his third season as head women's basketball coach at William Penn University in Oskaloosa, where he is building another winner.
 Williamson found his niche and is thriving in a job he never even dreamed of when he was in college.
 "We're off to a good start. We are 15-4 and in second place in the Heart of America Conference. We're just plugging away," Williamson said. "My first year over here we finished second in the conference and qualified for the NAIA national tournament, We went 30-3 last year and won the conference for the first time ever. It was the first time in 17 years that we got back to nationals. We had the Player of the Year, an All-American, but she graduated. We are trying to rebuild things this year. It's been a lot of fun."
 Williamson has twice been named Heart of America Conference Coach of the Year.
 Williamson is the second most successful coach in one of the most historic programs at Iowa Wesleyan. He compiled an overall record of 246-147. Williamson led Iowa Wesleyan to eight national tournament, won six conference championships and five conference tournament titles. Williamson has also guided the Tigers to a USCAA National Tournament runner-up finish during the 2015-2016 season.
 Williamson first made a name for himself at Ruthven High School, where he played point guard for a team which included future Iowa State star Loren Meyer, who went on to play for the Dallas Mavericks in the NBA.
 "He was a senior when I was a freshman," Williamson said. "I would dribble up the court and just lob it up to him. He got me a lot of assists."
 It was at Iowa Lakes when Williamson's life completely changed. A little talk with the Lakers' head coach gave Williamson a new direction and purpose in life.
 "We were in individual meetings and the coach asked me what I planned to do with my life," Williamson said. "He told me I should consider coaching. He thought I would be good at it."
 Williamson, after finishing up his last two years of college, joined Alan Magnani's staff. That provided the building block for his coaching career.
 "Alan hired me on as a student assistant and I just fell in love with it," Williamson said. "I learned how to break down films and how to beat people.Then the top assistant coach left and he asked me to be an assistant. I got the job and learned from Coach Magnani."
 Not all has been peaches and cream for Williamson. While his coaching career took off, it took its toll on his family. Now, he commutes 1 1/2 hours to Oskaloosa to coach, a profession which consumes a lot of time and requires a lot of travel. Williamson has learned to prioritize things in recent years.
 "I learned after my first year over here that I was putting basketball ahead of my family. I was wrong to do that," Williamson said. "I changed that this year. My son, Chase, is big into sports at Mount Pleasant High School. I decided that on Friday nights in football and baseball in the summer, I am going to watch my so play. I try to get to as much of Maddie's stuff as I can."
 Williamson had the added benefit of learning from former Burlington coach Tom Elmore, whose brother, Dennis, is Williamson's wife Courtney's father.
 Williamson, 43, is having the time of his life coaching at William Penn. But he realizes where his roots are and how important family is.
 "We love it in Mount Pleasant. Mount Pleasant has been great to me and my wife and our kids. They have gotten to experience high school athletics at a high level," Williamson said. "I make the sacrifice and drive back and forth to Oskaloosa every day. I am learning to put my family first."

Wars sometimes festively wrapped in red, and as often in blue, but wars which will continue unabated unless the stranglehold is broken.

Inside the Mullins Center at UMass, usually you’ll find fans cheering and chanting, rooting their team, but at Wednesday night’s game, it began on a much more somber note, with a moment of silence to remember Kobe and his daughter, Gianna Bryant, and the other seven killed in a helicopter crash.
 The game went on as planned, with Glen DeFrance from Connecticut there to watch with his wife and three daughters.
 “Since he joined the league from high school, I watched him and always admired Kobe as a player," DeFrance tells us.
 He says as a “girl dad”, he was in shock when he heard the news that he was involved in the crash, news that only became worse after learning his daughter was also on board.
 “I can’t imagine the last moments that Kobe had on that helicopter with his daughter, knowing that they were going down, what went through his mind, what he said to her the last minute or two," stated DeFrance.
 But DeFrance says it’s important to have these moment of silences to honor Kobe’s legacy, which he says isn’t just his performance on the court, but his role as a father that was incredibly active in his daughters’ lives.

Ginger McCall’s parting gift to Oregon was a crash course in the importance of independence.
 McCall, Oregon’s first public records advocate, resigned last year after just 18 months on the job, citing pressure from the governor’s general counsel to adopt stances that supported the governor’s agenda – not the public interest as her office’s name would suggest. Her courageous decision, delivered with the records to back up her claims, motivated the public records advisory council on which McCall served to make the office’s independence a top priority.
 Unfortunately, not everyone on the committee absorbed the lesson.
 The committee passed recommendations for a draft bill that legislators will consider next month. But one committee member, who dissented from the group, is seeking an amendment that would eviscerate the bill, cutting the reforms sought by the committee, including establishing independence for the public records advocate. The member, Oregon League of Cities lobbyist Scott Winkels, urged that legislators hold off on decoupling the position from the governor’s office, questioning whether the change would mean a lack of accountability for the advocate.
 His worries, however, are obscenely misplaced. Oregonians shouldn’t worry about a lack of accountability for an independent advocate, who would still report to the 13-member public records council of governmental representatives, journalists and non-voting legislators. Rather, the real problem lies with state and local agencies that have routinely escaped accountability for refusing to share records of government business with the public. As The Oregonian/OregonLive, other media organizations and many members of the public have shown ad nauseum, governmental bodies routinely drag out their responses to requests. They often demand thousands of dollars before releasing documents that they have decided are sensitive – whether or not they actually are. And some governmental bodies have even sued when ordered by the state attorney general or a district attorney to turn over documents.
 Yet those records, once received, often yield news stories and investigations that unquestionably serve the public. For example, after The Oregonian/OregonLive exposed Portland Public Schools’ decades of mishandling of sexual misconduct allegations against a longtime educator, the district revised its policies, adopted new training and advocated for state-level changes to make sure such failures don’t occur again. These are the kinds of benefits and reforms that get lost when agencies can evade scrutiny.
 Independence is critical for an advocate to be able to fearlessly lobby for proposals that can change Oregon’s secretive culture. An advocate who serves the public, rather than an elected official, can more fairly mediate disputes between agencies and requestors over release of a record. And a strong vote in favor of independence will help Oregon recruit the next good-governance champion that Oregonians need.
 Oregon has already lost a dedicated public servant with McCall’s resignation, though she remains invested in these reforms. She telephonically attended a meeting last week of the public records council, encouraging members to stay the course on the changes they are seeking.
 When legislators take up the legislation put forward by the council, they should think about the example that McCall set. They should recall that Gov. Kate Brown, after McCall’s resignation, now supports separating the position from her office’s supervision. They should remember the support that Oregonians throughout the state showed McCall and the cause of independence.
 But most of all, they should recognize that the status quo doesn’t serve the public. Legislators must demonstrate that they do.

 Mail Tribune, Aug. 29, on park fees:
 Jackson County commissioners will probably come in for more than their share of criticism for approving a batch of rate hikes for county parks and recreational facilities this month. The usual rhetoric will be deployed, from “the county should live within its means” to “they should use reserve funds instead of building a new jail.” All of those arguments are off the mark.
 As County Administrator Danny Jordan explains, the county parks system is an enterprise fund. That means it uses no tax dollars, and is supported entirely by user fees.
 Would it be nice if taxes supported parks and the fees could be kept to a minimum, or even eliminated altogether for county residents? Sure, but county taxes do not bring in enough to do that, and county residents wouldn’t be very happy if they did.
 Jackson County is blessed with some very attractive county parks, offering fishing, boating, camping and overnight accommodations including yurts and cabins. And the Emigrant Lake water slides offer additional summer fun.
 All of these attractions cost money to operate and to maintain, and parks fees have not increased in several years, while costs continued to rise. Deferred maintenance has built up as a result, leaving a backlog of plumbing issues, electrical work and paving that needs to be dealt with before it gets even more costly.
 The increases were recommended by the county’s Parks and Recreation Advisory Committee, made up of citizen volunteers. The new fees are reasonable, considering the value they represent to users. Some of the fees are going up more than others, with water slide wrist bands leading the way. The water slides are especially important to maintain because they would pose a safety risk if allowed to deteriorate.
 It’s worth noting that a number of fees — those affecting the largest number of park visitors — are not changing. Daily parking fees that everyone pays to use the parks will remain the same, as will the cost of renting a picnic shelter on weekends, the fee for staying in a Howard Prairie Resort cabin and boat rental and storage fees at Howard Prairie.

The event that shifted his image, and that did the most to billboard his gangster attitude, took place on Feb. 13, 2017, the day that his half-brother, Kim Jong-nam, was assassinated in the middle of the Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Malaysia. Most global political observers believed at the time, and still do, that Kim Jong-un, like some totalitarian version of Michael Corleone, was the one who gave the order to murder his relative; he wanted him out of the picture. But the way the killing went down was bizarre. Kim Jong- nam, a royal-family exile, had lived for more than 10 years in Macau, China, and was strolling through the brightly lit airport, on his way home, when he was attacked by two young women -- Siti Aisyah, 25, and Đoan Thj Huong, 28. Each of them came up, in turn, from behind, "Guess who!" style, and put her hands around his face, rubbing it with the deadly nerve agent VX. He was taken to the airport clinic but was dead within an hour. That's how toxic VX is.

Yet almost no one views this course we’re on with the attention it deserves. We should be talking into the nights with one another. Finding out what is true while there is still time to find out. We should be healing the inner ego dominator that has been culturally installed within us all. Then perhaps each of us can come to the enlightening conclusion that this society must be let go of if we are to survive past what is to come. If enough of us learn to painfully let go of our ego-driven passions, just maybe we will then notice and naturally come to a state of caring for what we should have been noticing and caring for all along.

The event that shifted his image, and that did the most to billboard his gangster attitude, took place on Feb. 13, 2017, the day that his half-brother, Kim Jong-nam, was assassinated in the middle of the Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Malaysia. Most global political observers believed at the time, and still do, that Kim Jong-un, like some totalitarian version of Michael Corleone, was the one who gave the order to murder his relative; he wanted him out of the picture. But the way the killing went down was bizarre. Kim Jong- nam, a royal-family exile, had lived for more than 10 years in Macau, China, and was strolling through the brightly lit airport, on his way home, when he was attacked by two young women — Siti Aisyah, 25, and Đoàn Thj Huong, 28. Each of them came up, in turn, from behind, "Guess who!" style, and put her hands around his face, rubbing it with the deadly nerve agent VX. He was taken to the airport clinic but was dead within an hour. That’s how toxic VX is.

El capítulo 6 de este Acuerdo es el que establece “el comercio administrado” y que notablemente no tiene referencia alguna a los aranceles de importación de represalia aplicado por China a los productos norteamericanos que abarcan el 57 % del total y por lo tanto serán mantenidos, como lo propio hace los EEUU con los 260 mil millones de USD de importaciones chinas sujetas a derechos de importación adicionales.
 Por otra parte, al tomar para hacer el Acuerdo las cifras del 2017, hacen las metas establecidas irreales por incumplibles, ya que al año 2019 las importaciones chinas provenientes de ese país, han decrecido unos 20 mil millones de USD que tienen que ver con la guerra comercial, pero también con el menor dinamismo de la economía china, así como el desplazamiento de proveedores norteamericanos por otros mas fiables.
 De hecho, para lograr esas metas tomando el año 2019, que es el mas cercano y real, las porcentajes a alcanzar de aumento de importaciones chinas deberían más que duplicarse, con respecto a las actuales y la pregunta que surge al respecto, es porque empresas privadas chinas adquirirían mas bienes americanos cuando se deben abonar derechos de importación adicionales que obviamente no están vigentes en otros países proveedores.
 Hay cuatro submetas establecidas en ese mismo Capítulo del Acuerdo y se refieren a cuanto deberán crecer las compras chinas y en que productos de Agricultura, Industria, Energía y Servicios.
 Tomando por caso la Agricultura, la meta en este rubro es un aumento de 18.5 mil millones de USD para el 2021 hasta alcanzar los 40.8 mil millones, en productos como porotos de soja, carnes, pescado, cereales, algodón y otros. En poroto de soja, la única posibilidad es desvío de comercio chino quitándole participación a Brasil y/o a la Argentina; y lo mismo pasa con el resto de los ítems, porque salvo en carnes - derivado de la fiebre porcina – no hay previsiones de aumentos como los calculados en este Acuerdo y por lo tanto todo incremento tenderá más a ser un desvío que nuevo comercio, invalidando el argumento central de Trump y sus negociadores comerciales que este es un “gran deal que aumentará las exportaciones norteamericanas, logrando genuinamente disminuir el desbalance comercial con China y mejorar el intercambio global”.
 En realidad, como sucede habitualmente con las prácticas de “comercio administrado” no hay ganancias reales, sino juego de compensaciones, que desvían comercio de uno o mas países hacia el que busca crecer a costillas del vecino “beggar my neighbour” como en toda política proteccionista y esta es una variante de ellas; de hecho los más perjudicados con las compras chinas serían aliados de EE.UU como la UE, Japón, Corea del Sur, Australia y Canadá.
 Ahora bien, como decía inicialmente hay 51.6 mil millones de USD de compras chinas de productos y servicios norteamericanos no cubiertos, con lo cual China podría adquirir mas de lo exigido por los EE.UU y dejar de lado esa cifra no incluida; en ese supuesto habría perdedores del lado presuntamente ganador, preguntándose estos porqué nos perjudica a nosotros y en el fondo, esto tiene que ver con las cada vez mayores limitaciones a las exportaciones norteamericanas hacia empresas chinas derivadas de supuestas amenazas a la seguridad nacional.
 Lo más probable es que China incumpla con las exigencias norteamericanas ya en el año 2020 y por lo tanto haya más medidas de castigo, seguramente a través de derechos de importación adicionales que graven la importación china. Esto, tal como esta en el Acuerdo, no tiene árbitros de terceros países como en la OMC o en el USCMA, sino que luego de reuniones bilaterales para conciliar posiciones es el propio USTR (Representante de Comercio de los EE.UU.), el que fija como proceder y que represalia aplicar; China puede si considera excesivo lo resuelto por ese organismo retirarse, con lo cual se abren las puertas para otra faz del conflicto.
 La ventaja de este Acuerdo para Trump y ya lo está promoviendo es “vender electoralmente” que ha logrado que China ofrezca sin condiciones más “Buy America” y lo que no dice es que si China incumple 2020, lo más probable, eso se conocerá estadísticamente en bienes recién en enero 2021 y servicios en marzo, cuatro meses después de las elecciones norteamericanas. Mientras tanto, quedan pendientes con China discutir sobre subsidios y las empresas estatales. Esa Fase 2 quedará para luego de las elecciones norteamericanas, mientras tanto China puede seguir desarrollando su Plan 2025.
 No es casual que Xi Jinping no haya suscripto esta Fase, simbólicamente dejó marcada la importancia que le otorgó.

 The grand project will reportedly cost the richest cricket board in the world a whopping Rs 500 crore and is expected to be completed in the coming two years.
 Batting legend Rahul Dravid, the current NCA director, is actively involved in the project.
 "There can’t be any specific amount assigned to the project," a BCCI official told _The Times of India. "_There will be tenders issued for each work. But going by the blueprint that’s in place, it is estimated that the project will cost around Rs 500 crore. There will be improvisations to the blueprint. The project is running six months late but with the new BCCI regime in place, work has begun in full swing. BCCI expects the CoE to be functional in another two years.

So as we go into 2020 we've got that time under our belt. Those platforms are now out. We had our biggest year ever in medical education and training last year with customers.

The Innovative Grants are given out annually and are awarded to organizations that present innovative solutions for the greater good of the community.
 Some of the plans presented by the recipients at Wednesday’s ceremony at Cochise College include teaching children how to garden and grow vegetables, bringing meals to the homes of people who do not qualify for other food programs, creating walkways that would allow the handicapped to access a community garden safely, and extending an after-school program to the neighborhoods in the city’s West End.
 The two largest grants — $75,000 each — were awarded to the Salvation Army and the Boys and Girls Club of Sierra Vista. The second biggest were $50,000 grants given to six entities that included the Town of Huachuca City. Eight other recipients took home grants between $42,500 and $15,000.
 “We read over the grants (proposals) and we as a committee voted on the ones that we thought were more innovative and needed in our community,” said Michael Groves, philanthropy committee chair and vice-chair of the Legacy Foundation Board.
 The Salvation Army intends on using its grant money to feed people who aren’t able to reach their facility. Capt. Carlos Souza said he will work with schools, hospitals and other groups to identify who needs the meals the most.
 “We’re super excited,” Souza said. “What are we going to do with the money? We’re going to bring meals to seniors who can’t qualify for Meals on Wheels. We’re going to bring meals to veterans who can’t come to our daily feedings.”
 Souza also mentioned helping pregnant women who may be the only food provider in a household, but can’t prepare meals because she may be having trouble because of her pregnancy. He also said the Salvation Army would provide meals for children in the community who may not be eating when they’re not in school, and are going hungry on weekends.
 Jay Hamright of the Boys and Girls Club of Sierra Vista, said the organization’s grant will go toward extending the after-school program to youngsters in the West End. Hamright said school officials have reported that many children have nowhere to go after class.
 “This grant will help us bring the Boys and Girls Club program to kids in that neighborhood, starting in August,” he said.
 One of the $50,000 grants was given to the Warrior Healing Project for its efforts to help more families of veterans who could be suicidal.
 Director Tim Kirk said veterans committing suicide in this country has reached crisis level.
 He said over 6,000 killed themselves in 2019.
 “That level of crisis is what’s bringing us together,” Kirk said after he accepted the grant. “This grant will help us become more engaged with more veterans’ families.”
 Huachuca City Mayor Johann Wallace said the $50,000 grant his town received would be used to restart the city’s bus service, which he said will include a route from Tombstone to Sierra Vista.
 A grant of $22,374, went to the Alzheimer’s Association Desert Southwest Chapter. Morgan Hartford, who accepted the grant check for the agency, said the money would be used to gain more volunteers who can speak both English and Spanish. Hartford said the agency has contacted the Mexican Consulate in Douglas to begin working with people in that community.
 “Every 65 seconds someone develops Alzheimer’s,” Hartford said. “The Alzheimer’s Association is dedicated to being at the forefront of this disease.”

So the way this is going to work is several fold. We have a reasonable pipeline right now of new clients and those clients take multiple quarters to come on board and generate revenues, so that there are -- there is that component of that immediate business there. Then there is other clients that, that we're talking with that are -- they are substantive, they are large, but some of the strategic items that we have to do need to get done before we're actually a viable player. So for example, there is one player that has $700 million of reasonably low-cost deposits, just one single broker dealer. The reality of that is that we have some technological elements that will put us in a very good place to compete for those sort of clients, not guaranteeing we can get them and that's probably about a year to 15 months off before all that technology will be deployed. But once it does get deployed, some of it will truly be best-in-class in the industry and others will put us more table stakes.

Who were the two women? That’s the gripping subject of "Assassins," a lively but sinister page-turner of a documentary directed by Ryan White ("Ask Dr. Ruth," "The Case Against 8"). Like a number of docs I’ve seen at Sundance, notably "The Dissident" (about the murder of the Saudi Arabian Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi), "Assassins" takes a relatively recent news scandal and reassembles into an illuminating big picture. The events may be familiar to news junkies, yet after being shocked by the murder of King Jong-nam back in 2017, I admit that I followed the story for a while and then lost track of it. The key revelation of "Assassins" — who these women were, and how they came to commit a headline-making hit job in broad daylight — had somehow escaped me (as, I suspect, it did a lot of people).

“Minari” has been an unquestionable high point to this year’s Sundance, a breakout critical hit that with exquisite tenderness and simple beauty brings to life a classic immigrant tale and a compassionate family drama. The film, an American production with dialogue mostly in Korean, has some heavyweight backers. It was produced by Plan B Productions (Brad Pitt is an executive producer), and independent distributor A24 is releasing it later this year.

And there is active luck - taking advantage of opportunities. On notable occasions I have grabbed these. Life is never perfect, it is never going to be exactly the right time to do anything, you have to seize the big chances when they turn up. Determination is key. I'm not tall, not good at sports, am average looking but am a determined little bugger. I have seen very clever and talented people fall by the wayside as they have not got that determination.

Legislatively, there was not a lot of change in the fourth quarter and we've said this many times that it's really the health care worker that's driving this legislation. It's more of a lagging indicator at this point in time. The health care environment has really embraced the need for the smoke-free workplace because of all the health hazards associated with surgical smoke and we're doing our best to support that initiative behind the scenes and legislation has not fundamentally changed in the last quarter. So I think I got all your questions there, Kristen. But if I didn't, please ask again.

Like the rest of his teammates, Maxey didn’t panic when the Wildcats trailed the Commodores 35-28 at the half, their largest deficit at the half this season.
 “No panic,” he said. ‘We just went out and trusted our training. Coach Cal told us to play as a driven team. We just stepped up.”
 Maxey relied on his training to carry him through his recent struggles. Maxey scored 14 points in the previous two games and had missed his previous three shots from long range before burying two of Kentucky’s three shots from long range against the Commodores.
 He also played a big role down the stretch when point guard Ashton Hagans went to the bench with four fouls. Maxey popped a clutch 3-pointer, sank a couple of free throws and made a jumper in the lane to help the hosts hold off Vandy.
 “We have three point guards on the court and when Ashton went out, it was the next man up,” he said. “I just went out there and did what I had to do."
 Even though the 17-point performance tied his career-high against Southeastern Conference foes, Maxey, who netted the same tally at Georgia earlier this month, has been improving behind the scenes.
 “Coach Cal has the most confidence in me,” Maxey said. “He just tells me he knows I can do a lot better. He always tells me that the know I can and I just try to go out there and do that.”
 Maxey’s training took an upward trend earlier this week when he beat out teammate Immanuel Quickley in a running drill in practice. The impressive finish sent a message to Calipari.
 “He told on himself,” Calipari said. “He's finishing in the middle all year. Why would you have ever finished in the middle if you could have finished first? He told on himself. Now, he still had lapses in this game, but he still was more aggressive and he made some plays, things that he hadn't been doing.”
 The extra nudge from Calipari in practice is routine for Maxey.
 “I believe in him and he just told me to go out and finish every single sprint,” Maxey said. “I’m a lot more confident out there on the court and that’s what I try to do.”

“During the ‘80s and ‘90s the most famous rental house in L.A. was this little cottage at the end of a long private driveway up on Woodrow Wilson Drive,” says Sloane. “It overlooked the entire Valley, it had a big modern addition with a sports court, and everyone from Al Pacino to Princess Diana stayed there. It was decorated in a kind of 1950s, Gene Autry, country way, and it was funky. It had blue shag pile carpeting in the master bedroom and everyone loved it! When Princess Diana was in L.A. she allegedly stayed at the British Consulate, but she was actually at that house, sleeping in the bedroom with blue shag carpeting. Eventually the older couple who owned it — and made a fortune from it — died, and it was sold to a television producer, but for 20 years it was the most legendary house in L.A.”

MOUNT PLEASANT -- It took Maddie Williamson a few weeks to adjust to playing basketball at the college level.
 The Iowa Wesleyan University freshman guard and Mount Pleasant High School graduate has caught on fast, and now is making a big impact for the Tigers.
 Williamson, a 5-foot-4 guard, has found her groove in the second half of the season for the Tigers. She is averaging 10.4 points, 3.9 rebounds, 1.7 steals and 1.1 assists for the 3-14 Tigers, who are 3-7 in the St. Louis Intercollegiate Athletic Conference.
 It took Williamson a few games to get her feet wet, but now she has found her role and is flourishing.
 "I've just been trying to get into the swing of college athletics, learning my new teammates and getting used to school work and everything," Williamson said. "It's a lot more competitive here. It's changed my game and how I play. You can't pout and you can't be mad if you make a mistake. You don't have time for that because it's so fast-paced. You really have to be in shape to play at this level."
 Williamson is coming off two of the best games of her young career. She scored 20 points, grabbed eight rebounds, had three steals and dished out two assists in a home loss to Fontbonne. On Saturday, Williamson had 15 points, four rebounds and a steal in a road win over Principia College.
 The road trips have been a big adjustment for Williamson, too, with numerous trips to the St. Louis area.
 "The road trips are a struggle," Williamson said. "They weren't that far in high school. Now they are four hours or more of sitting on a bus. It's always cool to look up in the stands and see my Mom and my brother and sister, but the road trips are so long they can't make it to all of them. I either try to sleep or listen to music. Sometimes we play games or just sit around and talk. It gives us a chance to bond as a team."
 The fact that Williamson has progressed so fast should come as no surprise. Her father, Steve Williamson, is in his third season as head coach of the women's basketball team at William Penn University in Oskaloosa. Steve Williamson is the second most successful coach in women's basketball at Iowa Wesleyan. He compiled an overall record of 246-147 and took the Tigers to eight national tournaments, six regular-season conference championships and five conference tournament titles. His teams have been recognized on a national level, finishing the 2009 season as the No. 14 team in the country and appearing in the Sweet 16 and Elite 8 in the national tournament. Coach Williamson also guided the Tigers to a USCAA National Tournament runner-up finish during the 2015-2016 season.
 Steve Williamson imparted as much knowledge as his daughter could soak up, but he never forced the game on her.
 "Maddie was fortunate to have grown up around some great young ladies in the basketball program at Iowa Wesleyan," Steve Williamson said. "We had players come over to our house a lot because we had a true family atmosphere, so Maddie was around it 16 or 17 years of her life, being around players like Ali DeVries, Anna Jones and Darby Massner. She saw what it took to bee great."
 "I started playing when I was in third or fourth grade," Maddie Williamson said. "It was hard when I was younger because my dad was too busy to get to a lot of my games, but I got to go to practices and games with him and be around a lot of great players and see what that was like. He doesn't get to many of my games now because he is busy coaching. But he texts me after every game and looks at my stats and tells me I did a good job and we talk about it when he gets home."
 Maddie Williamson is learning a new system under first-year Iowa Wesleyan coach Temaine Wright. It has been challenging because the Tigers are short on numbers -- and height -- meaning Williamson gets to play extended minutes. It has its good points and bad points.
 "Coach Wright is doing things the right way. He is changing how he wants things to get done. He pushes you to be the best you can be," Williamson said. "I just need to go out and play my game and I know my team is there to back me up. I can't be scared to shoot, especially when people are running at me when I shoot. I just go out and play."

GALESBURG-Each year hundreds of children enter Knox, Warren, Henderson, McDonough and Fulton Counties' juvenile court system due to abuse or neglect. CASA of West Central Illinois is looking for volunteers to advocate for these children.
 CASA stands for Court Appointed Special Advocates and is a small non-profit agency that trains volunteers to speak up for the best interests of children affected by abuse and neglect in Knox, Warren, Henderson, McDonough, and Fulton Counties' legal and child welfare system.
 CASA volunteers are appointed by judges to make sure these vulnerable children do not get lost in the legal and social service system or languish in an inappropriate group or foster home. Any adult (age 21) who completes the screening requirements and initial training sessions may become an advocate.
 The training classes are held quarterly. The next session begins in February.
 If you are interested in volunteering, please contact their office by phone (309) 343-4299 or email srobison@casaofwestcentralillinois.com.

Who were the two women? That's the gripping subject of "Assassins," a lively but sinister page-turner of a documentary directed by Ryan White ("Ask Dr. Ruth," "The Case Against 8"). Like a number of docs I've seen at Sundance, notably "The Dissident" (about the murder of the Saudi Arabian Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi), "Assassins" takes a relatively recent news scandal and reassembles into an illuminating big picture. The events may be familiar to news junkies, yet after being shocked by the murder of King Jong-nam back in 2017, I admit that I followed the story for a while and then lost track of it. The key revelation of "Assassins" -- who these women were, and how they came to commit a headline-making hit job in broad daylight -- had somehow escaped me (as, I suspect, it did a lot of people). As you watch the movie, I promise that there are moments when your jaw will drop. "Assassins" is a terrific true-crime story, but it's also a documentary thriller about the new world disorder.

But it's an interesting business, just given some increased competition in certain areas that we're paying attention to. And in some cases, we're simply letting business go that we don't really think we want to participate in. So, that is going to be something we have to watch on an ongoing basis.

This show is such an important part of so many people's lives. When I did my first -- and only -- convention, I was amazed at how many people turned out for Eileen. But I realized that the way the Winchesters live their lives are kind of analogous to people who have disabilities, whether they're invisible or visible, because the surface of what their lives seem to be doesn't necessarily match how it actually is. They have this thing that makes them different than what the world perceives as normal, and so they therefore require a hidden network of people who understand that life. I think might be one reason why Eileen had that sort of impact on the fanbase. I don't know if I've ever seen a deaf person kick ass the way that Eileen does and I've certainly never played that before. Deaf or disabled people are usually the victim, not the one who rescues. The fact that she is such a viable love interest is not insignificant either. So many times people don't see people with disabilities as feasible relationship material. Because of that they're often desexualized and written off, especially in that particular sort of way, but it's something that is so central to the human experience, and it's something that people deserve to have if they're so inclined. And so the fact that the main character of the show is interested in a deaf woman in that way is something that I believe is the opposite of reductive. It's enhancing, not just for the a character, but for young people with disabilities in the audience. I hope they see themselves the way that Sam sees Eileen and realize that they can, should, and will be seen that way by people that are important to them and to the world, because that carries an inordinate amount of weight.

So allow me to cover briefly the progress on each one of these pillars. During the year -- if you go to the next slide, we further leverage the diversification and scale of the Group, and we have been improving operational performance across the regions, but also in our global businesses. We have simplified into a three region management structure, which is delivering excellent results. We announced this in April. There is a much more effective collaboration across the regions in parallel, but also convergent against the common group ultimately building one single platform.

I mean, look, it's easier being an analyst than running a company as you guys do. But at the end of the day, you are the company that has had the most staying power. You're the ones who have been investing in the food can. And there's always excess capacity in the food can business, just because of the nature of the manufacturing process. So I would imagine, hopefully over time, that's something that you can and should get leverage for.

Yes. In the short run this is the quarter, Steve, were the one big notable items that we have incentive plan to all payout in the quarter. We don't do that quarterly. So you have a whole year's worth of that payout this quarter which reflects in the pay down on some of our accruals. So yes, I would say as a more macro comment than now we're -- we've completed our first lap -- annual lap on 606. We should go back to being a company where there's a very tight correlation between our earnings and our cash flow generation. And so this quarter specifically of course we have the payouts of all the annual incentives that show up in this quarter's cash flow, operating cash flow.

The apocalypse has already been scheduled by capitalists and nation-states and it's coming to a town near you if you care to see it. If capitalists and governments of the world do everything they already have scheduled over the next decade then the 2020s will be the last decade before the fall. Like, for instance, the largest mining project ever is being dreamed up so that people can wear more pretty rocks on their fingers and around their necks. Or the spread of radioactive brine that is being openly dumped across the country for equally idiotic reasons. Or if the military continues to expand, which is already the world’s largest polluter, and if it continues unchecked, should ensure there’s nothing to notice and nothing to care for by the end of the century, that is to give a rather generous timeline. To make matters worse they've already done enough ecological damage to make the idea of the world supporting the projected 10 billion people by 2050 a rather farcical idea. So what happens as our population expands and the ability of the world to support life decreases? My guess, nothing good.

Yeah, I think we've always kind of look at seasonal differences. So yes, this next quarter, of course, we have Block where we have seasonal increases in non-interest bearing. But the bottom line, majority of that growth was due to two fiduciary balances that came in. And we don't necessarily expect that to stay at that same level because it does depend upon basically settlements and one settlement's get paid. So, we can't tell you how fast we would amortize off, but there is a chance that it's going to be -- come down faster than our normal Chapter 7 balances.

We've made the associated go direct or channel change move and have new people up and running. Now their productivity is a whole different question and we think that productivity ramps as the year unfolds. And because we started this now a quarter ago, we're going to get to that productivity ramp sooner. The second half which we just announced this morning was the U.S. -- or this afternoon was the U.S. Orthopedics business. And literally we are just coming out of those communications in the month of January when you have your sales meetings and you talk to your team and you look at the performance and you look at the new product cadence that they've been given and what's coming and you say what do we need to best match up sales commercial with product innovation that we've provided or are providing.

On Orthopedics, I think, I'd take you back to what Todd said. About 30% of that business is capital. We have -- if you look back over our results over the last two years really we've had very good capital performance every quarter for effectively two years. And the fourth quarter of last year was a really strong capital quarter. And we just didn't get the capital orders in to get us over the hill on that in that business. So a little bit disappointed there. Don't think it has anything to do with the macro perspective. I think the capital markets are still strong. We just didn't get the performance done, the work done that we needed to get where we wanted to get.

I think it might be a bit premature, but obviously, we always try to do that. I think also you have to bear in mind that there is just more broadly with respect to our loan growth targets and maybe pressure on the asset side and with respect to the ability, if we're able to maintain and sustain some of these non-interest-bearing balances, but with respect to these just given the nature of different various settlements that can occur at different times and things like that, I just think it's a little premature to do that given the steadiness of -- the inflows and the outflows are not always predictable enough to make that conclusion right now.

This show is such an important part of so many people’s lives. When I did my first -- and only -- convention, I was amazed at how many people turned out for Eileen. But I realized that the way the Winchesters live their lives are kind of analogous to people who have disabilities, whether they’re invisible or visible, because the surface of what their lives seem to be doesn’t necessarily match how it actually is. They have this thing that makes them different than what the world perceives as normal, and so they therefore require a hidden network of people who understand that life. I think might be one reason why Eileen had that sort of impact on the fanbase. I don’t know if I’ve ever seen a deaf person kick ass the way that Eileen does and I’ve certainly never played that before. Deaf or disabled people are usually the victim, not the one who rescues. The fact that she is such a viable love interest is not insignificant either. So many times people don’t see people with disabilities as feasible relationship material. Because of that they’re often desexualized and written off, especially in that particular sort of way, but it’s something that is so central to the human experience, and it’s something that people deserve to have if they’re so inclined. And so the fact that the main character of the show is interested in a deaf woman in that way is something that I believe is the opposite of reductive. It’s enhancing, not just for the a character, but for young people with disabilities in the audience. I hope they see themselves the way that Sam sees Eileen and realize that they can, should, and will be seen that way by people that are important to them and to the world, because that carries an inordinate amount of weight.
