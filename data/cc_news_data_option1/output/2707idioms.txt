“In 1989, the word was used by the media and others in ways that dehumanized the group of boys who were falsely accused and wrongfully convicted,” they said. “In light of the renewed focus on racial justice taking root across the country, we felt it important to pause and learn more – to consider whether a word used to demean in one context can remain free of that negative association in another context.”
 According to the Committee, during the pause caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, they “connected with people who study and teach issues of race, culture, and equity. Not wanting to rely solely on the thoughts of individuals, (they) also reached out to representatives of organizations such as the NAACP.”
 “In light of the feedback we’ve received, we believe the best decision is to select Wolves as our new mascot,” they said. “We feel this honors the work done by our selection committee and the input received from many in our community (both when it was initially solicited and more recently).

It was making clothes for Boohoo's Nasty Gal brand.
 Lesley Duncan, deputy head of UK equities at Aberdeen Standard Investments, SLA's fund management arm, said it had invested in Boohoo since its flotation in 2014.

This is a transcript of the Cabin Fever podcast Alex Brooker: 'I'm the most comfortable I've ever been with my disability' as released on 6 July 2020 and presented by Emma Tracey.
 [Jingle - Ouch]
 EMMA - Hello, and welcome to the Cabin Fever podcast from BBC Ouch. I'm Emma Tracey. In this episode I'm speaking to Alex Brooker, long term host of 'The Last Leg' from Channel 4, or what we like to call Ouch on the telly. Alex has lots of interesting limb differences, and he's been joking about disability for about eight years now. So I started off by asking him why he'd gone from a pretty light-hearted Friday night chat show to making a pretty serious documentary for the BBC.
 ALEX - I wanted to kind of take a look at disability as a broader subject really for the first time in my life, you know. I've just turned 36 and I've got two children of my own now, and I think that I'd got to the stage where I was starting to ask more questions maybe than what I ever did before. Which might sound strange to some people but I've always kind of just got on with it.
 EMMA - That does sound unusual to me because obviously you have been talking about disability on the telly for eight years on and off. But I guess the other part of it is you were thrown into that, you decided out of never doing anything disability related before to apply for the Channel 4 presenter scheme and then suddenly you're on the telly, like on the actual big, real, Channel 4 telly during the Paralympics. Like, that's incredible.
