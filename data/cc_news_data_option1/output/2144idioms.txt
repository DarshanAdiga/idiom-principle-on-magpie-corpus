SEBRING — Americans have tried to come to grip with the death of George Floyd, the Minneapolis man who died in police custody in that city, and who played basketball for South Florida Community College.
 When asked, heads of local law enforcement told the Highlands News-Sun what they have done to guard against any such situations here, and expressed hope from how local residents have coped with the news, in light of violence in other parts of the country.
 Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri, president of the Florida Association of Sheriff’s, expressed sympathies on behalf of all Florida sheriffs to the family of George Floyd, and said, in an emailed statement, that the Minneapolis police officer used deadly force in a situation where there was no justification.

Fansler hopes that good community relations built on extending respect for all people at all times would guard against something like that happening here.
 Officers receive 80 hours of defensive tactics training, Fansler said via email Friday. Once sworn in, officers must take annual training on use of force.
 Fansler said complaints of excessive force “are not something our agency sees much of,” which he attributed, along with training, to the body cameras Lake Placid officers wear.
 He didn’t know if there is anything that could be said to be 100% effective at preventing something bad from occurring.
 “However, as long as we continue to extend courtesy and respect to each other and continue to set an example for up and coming generations, hopefully, these situations will never find a place here,” Fansler said.
 Hoglund said his officers also do use-of-force training, which includes understanding physiological response and de-escalation tactics — which Hoglund said amounts to good communication.
 He said he couldn’t recall the last time Sebring police had a complaint of excessive force, but it would be handled — as any investigative complaint — to assess what they do know, identify what they don’t know and hold accountable whomever would be responsible for what happened.
 “Even if an officer does everything right, if at the end of the day a life is gone, it’s a tragedy,” Hoglund said. “It’s terrible.”
 “The events in Minneapolis are tragic all around,” Fansler said. “Tragedy is truly what this is.”

Mumbai (Maharashtra) [India], June 2 (ANI/NewsVoir): The Indo-French Chamber of Commerce and Industry (IFCCI) and the Indo-German Chamber of Commerce (IGCC) presented a white paper "Challenges faced by French and German companies in Maharashtra caused by Nationwide COVID-19 Lockdown" to Subhash Desai, Minister for Industries and Mining of Maharashtra, Government of Maharashtra, during a live session on June 2, 2020.   The white paper was developed as a joint initiative of the Indo-French Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Indo-German Chamber of Commerce, and consulting firm Roedl & Partner with the support of the French and German Consulates in Mumbai.   In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Government of India has extended the nationwide lockdown for the fourth time. The extended lockdown has caused numerous business and economic disruptions which create challenges for companies to restart their operations.   The white paper contains the financial, commercial, and labour related conditions and challenges faced by French and German companies operating in Maharashtra to explore specific solutions to help smoothen business operations in the state. It highlights key aspects that policymakers should consider in their policy-making deliberations.   Sonia Barbry, Consul General of France in Mumbai, and Dr Juergen Morhard, Consul General of the Federal Republic of Germany in Mumbai, who supported the joint initiatives of both Chambers are looking forward to facilitating the follow-up of the White Papers recommendation with the Maharashtra government.   "Maharashtra has traditionally been one of the top investment destinations for European, and in particular, for French and German companies in India. This webinar meeting and the suggestions in the form of a White Paper are just the continuation of a long and well established regular dialogue with Honourable Minister Desai himself, as well as with the Government of Maharashtra in association with the relevant Consulates, Chambers and our industries," expressed Dr Juergen Morhard,   "Maharashtra is the home base of our Indo-French Chamber members in India with leading investments in business and CSR activities. We at IFCCI are very glad to have the support of the Govt. of Maharashtra in these delicate times," similarly reiterated Sumeet Anand, President of IFCCI.   The Indo-German Chamber of Commerce and the Indo-French Chamber of Commerce and Industry are committed to support its member companies and to promote bilateral trade between the two countries and India to achieve sustainable economic development.
