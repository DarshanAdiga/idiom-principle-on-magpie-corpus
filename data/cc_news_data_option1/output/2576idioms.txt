"That just underscores the fact what we've said every week, all of us, that this virus is on the prowl, and in some places it's gaining momentum. It's not slowing down. That spread is not slowing down. It's just doing the opposite, and that's why you see a number of states -- even though they maybe reopened recently -- they are now going back and closing some of those facilities or closing parts of their economy.

The centre has informed the Bombay high court that it may consider declaring sanitary napkins as an essential commodity after public interest litigation was filed in this regard. The petitioners, law students, in light of the lockdown and Covid pandemic had sought directions for sanitary napkins to be made an essential commodity and be provided through the public distribution system.
 The division bench headed by chief justice Dipankar Datta while hearing the petition filed by the students Nikita Gore and Vaishnavi Gholave through advocate Vinod Sangvikar on June 5 was informed that due to the pandemic situation most outlets dispensing sanitary napkins were shut. As a result of many women from the poor and marginalized sections of the society were unable to maintain personal hygiene due to the non-availability of sanitary napkins.
 In light of these submissions, the petitioners had sought directions to the government to recognize sanitary napkins as an essential commodity by making changes to the Essential Commodity Act, 1955 and also sought effective implementation of the 'Menstrual Hygiene Management National Guidelines, 2015'.
 On June 5, after the state submitted that any addition in the Act was the prerogative of the centre, the bench had directed the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) to respond to the plea within three weeks.
 In response, MoHFW under-secretary Dilip Kumar Sahu submitted an affidavit last week which said that the petitioners were making sweeping allegations about the government machinery not functioning properly during the lockdown. The affidavit stated that MoHFW has been implementing the 2015 programme for promoting menstrual hygiene for girls between 10 and 19 years of age and states and union territories have a decentralised process for procuring sanitary napkins through a competitive bidding process ensuring quality standards.
 Sahu further stated in the affidavit, "I most humbly submit that the decision to bring sanitary napkins under the essential commodities may be done after understanding the current market scenario, demand-supply gap, if any; also keeping in mind the various options of brands, quality, specification, costing and preferences of the beneficiaries."
 The affidavit added that a decision could be taken after consulting the Consumer Affairs Ministry and involving all stakeholders.
 As per the directions of the court on June 5, the petitioners have to file a rejoinder to the affidavit after which the petition will be heard.

"Reason to Be Reasonable" sets a clever trap using a heartfelt, falsetto chorus and some choice songwriting ("It begins to dawn on me/If we fuck it up completely, I still recall it fondly"), but it never evolves beyond a steady drumbeat and some empty lyrical promises. "Drama King" rings hollow and takes way too long to catch fire, "Idiosyncrasies" tries for an off-kilter hep vibe but quickly drowns in its own tone, and "Rusty Nail" treads similar ground as 2011's "Second Chance" but lacks the urgency (and the cowbell) to propel it forward. After a little over 30 minutes, _Endless Dream_  fades quietly into the background with the dull strains of "A Week-End" before trying to come back to life with the pseudo-gusto of closer "On the Brink." Most of the songs never properly get off the ground before they're over and done and the album suffers from the same fate.

_Endless Dream_ is scaled back and overly minimal in an unenthusiastic way. Drums make up the center of most of these songs, which makes them difficult to endure. None of the songs, with the exception of "Out of Nowhere" and "Reason to Be Reasonable," have any momentum to carry the band over the top of the mountain and, what's worse, the band sounds bored, sleepwalking through the motions. As on the album's cover, Peter Bjorn and John are looking up at the Technicolor mountain, marveling at unscaled heights in front of them. _Endless Dream_ sits at the base of that mountain, never cresting, never moving. It's a rare miss from a band capable of much, much more. (www.peterbjornandjohn.com)

This won't be a full lunar eclipse. This is called a "penumbral" lunar eclipse. The difference between penumbral and total or partial eclipses is that the Earth's outermost shadow or the penumbra falls on the face of the Moon. This makes for a more subtle shadow over the moon compared to a sharp shadow during a partial eclipse, making it a bit more difficult to observe.

This Ganpati season, the by-lanes of Lalbaug in south Mumbai's Chinchpokli will be bereft of the usual rush of devotees waiting for a view of their favourite elephant God. For the first time in the 86 years of its existence, the Lalbaugcha Raja Ganpati Mandal (committee) will not have an idol this year, in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.
 Instead, an 11-day blood and plasma donation drive will be held at the Lalbaugcha Raja pandal from August 22. The donation camp will aid health workers in the city in their fight against the virus, said Balasaheb Sudam Kamble, president of the committee.
 While the decision is in the interest of the physical-distancing norms set by the government, devotees of 'bappa', as he is fondly referred to, are not too happy. Many have thronged the pandal every year for a 'darshan' (viewing) or to ask for a 'mannat' (wish) but this year, they will be deprived of the trip.
 Smita Mestry, a 28-year-old IT professional, has been visiting the Raja every year.
 To not be able to visit him this year has upset her. "I have a lot of faith in him. At least they should have placed a smaller idol and allowed a virtual darshan for the devotees," said the Andheri resident.
 The decision was not so simple, according to Santosh Kambli, the chief murtikar or sculptor of Lalbaugcha Raja. "In most other sarvajanik mandals, there are two idols. A smaller one for the puja and the bigger one is for darshan. But in Lalbaug, the 14-feet idol is the one for both," said Kambli, whose family has been making the idol for Lalbaugcha Raja for three generations and has held a patent for the idol since 2011.
 The Maharashtra government had issued guidelines for Ganesh pandals and set the height for all idols at 4 feet. "We cannot reduce the height of the idol as we have been doing puja for 86 years. As we could not build the 14-feet idol, we decided to not have an idol at all," said Kambli, who has lost around 50% of his business owing to the pandemic.
 His 79-year-old father, Ratnakar, who usually adds final touches to the idol and draws the eyes, is sorely missing the 'bappa' this year. "He [Lalbaugcha Raja] is not just an idol that we make. He is an emotion for our family," said Kambli.
 Established in 1934 by the fishermen community of Kolis in Chinchpokli, Lalbaugcha Raja or 'Mannat cha Raja' (loosely translated as the wish-granting king), has since come to symbolise the Ganpati festival in the city.
 Until this year, the mandal had managed to brave the Emergency (1975-77) and the Mumbai riots (1992-93) to set up the 14-feet idol every year. Over 1.5 crore devotees from various parts of the state throng the pandal through the 11 days in hopes of getting their wishes granted. The committee also receives large donations from devotees that are then used in several public service activities. In 2019 alone, the committee received donations to the tune of ₹12 crore.
 "The decision to not organise the Ganesh festival this year is understandable as we need to focus on the society at present. But for someone who has not missed visiting the Ganesh idol at Lalbaugh fort the past 47 years, I will miss being part of the festivities this time round," said Ajinkya Mhatre, 68, a retired banker and Borivali resident.
 For Hassan Khan, 30, visiting the Lalbaugcha Raja every year with friends is an emotion. "Ganpati festival is the biggest one in the city and Lalbaugcha Raja is a flavour of the festival, which will be missing this year," said Khan, a Goregaon resident.
