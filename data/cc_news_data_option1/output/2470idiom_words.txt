Louise Redknapp has been treating fans to regular workout content in lockdown, and it's safe to say she is looking incredible.
 The singer, 45, showed off her rock-hard abs in a sizzling mirror selfie following a gruelling workout at home.
 Wearing a simple black sports bra, Louise let her dark blonde locks flow as she posed for the snap.
 Louise - who divorced footballer Jamie in 2017 - teamed her sporty look up with olive green leggings and a jumper tied over her waist.
 The punchline of the selfie were her shoes, as Louise wore her workout trainers on one foot and some fancy heels on the other.

Inmates got coronavirus relief checks, and IRS wants them back | Fox Business

Israelis tend to get up close and personal, entering your personal space. And this invasion of privacy can be noticed in a metaphorical sense as well. Because Israelis often ask unguarded questions about your family, relationship status and even salary. Notice that they also overshare with you – it’s a two- way street! If you feel uncomfortable in these situations, try to remember that Israelis build trust by building relationships. And through these personal questions they are just trying to get to know you better and establish their business connection with you based on friendship or at least a solid foundation of familiarity. So I recommend you respond in a friendly, straightforward manner to such questions, whether you provide them with all the information they seek or not, as the dialogue is important for future collaboration.
