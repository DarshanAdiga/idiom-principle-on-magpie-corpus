But if the State’s top medic believes non-essential foreign travel this summer is a bad idea and if all the indications are that coronavirus is far from under control in many countries across the EU, then perhaps the Cabinet could make it crystal clear that overseas travel is simply not going to be on the table this summer.

Democrats have been outspoken in their concerns that Pack, a conservative filmmaker and associate of former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, has been brought on board to turn VOA and the other outlets into a pro-Trump propaganda machine with little regard for the independence granted them by their founding charter. Wednesday's letter was notable in that it was signed by the two powerful Trump allies who are particularly close to the president.

With much of America's workforce being laid off or fired due to COVID-19, many will be on the lookout for employment in the coming weeks and months. Finding a new job can be grueling, but once you find the perfect one, it's important to nail the interview.
   
 "Job interviews are literally the first impression of you as a potential employee and can seriously affect the potential for job placement within any industry," said Jennifer Weaver, the area manager at Consolidated Staffing ENC. "If you are on time, dressed for the occasion, prepared with a hard copy of your resume and have ready answers, that will get you further in the process than if you were to be late, shabbily dressed and unprepared."
   
 Weaver gave a few examples of how an interview can make or break your opportunity for employment.
   
 "We had a man come in who was homeless and just wanted to work," Weaver said. "He didn't try to hide his hardships, was very up front about his experience and background and even some former health issues but he was the most respectful employee I have ever had the pleasure of interviewing. He showed up in jeans and sneakers that had seen better days, but he worked hard to explain everything, and I was happy to be able to place him."
   
 On a separate occasion, another man came in with the opposite attitude.
   
 "He sat down and looked me dead in the eye and told me all of the things he wouldn't do for work, that he didn't want to work outside, he didn't want to work more than a few days a week," Weaver said. "He had several felonies and couldn't pass a drug test. Then he proceeded to get upset when I told him we would not be able to place him."
   
 The difference between these two outcomes is all in the way each of these men presented themselves to the interviewer, and there are certain things that can be done to obtain the best possible outcome for yourself.
   
 Interviews can be stressful, but that stress can be minimized by being fully prepared. This includes knowing exactly where you're going, where you'll park, what traffic is like, and how long it will take you to get there, said Sherry Irsik, the career connections coordinator at Lenoir Community College.
   
 "I recommend that when you have an interview scheduled … you do a trial run from where you're leaving from to that location so that you're confident on the day of the interview," Irsik said.
   
 She also mentioned it is likely your interview could be conducted online, considering social distancing and other coronavirus precautions. Irsik said in this case, you should still conduct a practice run, making sure audio and video are working, and that there will be no audible or visual distractions in the background.
   
 "If you have children or pets, you want to be sure that there aren't going to be background noises," Irsik said. "You want to keep in mind what the interviewers are looking at on your screen besides yourself."
   
 Another important aspect of preparation is deciding how to dress. James Andersen, the career and placement coordinator at Coastal Carolina Community College, said a good rule of thumb is to dress one level above the daily dress code.
   
 "If the position requires a shirt and tie, then wear a suit," Andersen said. "If the dress code is slacks and a polo, then wear a button-up long sleeve and a sport coat."
   
 Investing in a well-fitted outfit and shining your shoes can go a lot further than one may think, Andersen said. He also said smoking or vaping before an interview isn't a good idea, as the smell will be overwhelming in a small room.
   
 Another stressor can be not knowing what the interviewer will ask or how to answer certain questions. Andersen said the three toughest ones can be the getting-to-know-you questions.
   
 "When you tell them about you, give them a light mix of professional and personal, but not too much personal," Andersen said. "Remember, we are not robots. We are humans, and people hire people - so they want to get to know you."
   
 Thankfully telling your interviewer about yourself, your biggest strengths and your biggest weaknesses are easy to practice in front of a mirror or with a friend. When practicing these answers, Andersen said you should examine yourself, how well you match the job description, and offer an example. If asked a question you hoped to avoid, try to answer calmly and honestly, not defensively.
   
 During the interview, Weaver, Irsik, and Andersen all agree cell phones should be turned off and put away. They also suggest not chewing gum, interrupting the interviewer, or being dishonest.
   
 "You never want to not tell the truth in an interview," Irsik said. "In the end, it will come out and it doesn't reflect well on you."
   
 Overall, being prepared and putting your best foot forward is the best way to ensure a good outcome.
   
 "It's normal to be nervous for an interview," Irsik said. "I always remind people to take a deep breath and smile, don't forget to smile."

Such a step would protect those who do the right thing, instead of punishing them. It would certainly be a more effective measure than simply shouting impotently at the radio of a dreary Wednesday morning.
