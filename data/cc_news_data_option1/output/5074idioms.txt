The event that commenced early September, connected players spread across State lines, and the WBFI also reached out to families facing financial difficulties, sponsoring care kits across the country. Mike Frogley, National Academy Director, Wheelchair Basketball Canada, was all praise for the virtual outreach. “I cannot tell you how impressed I am that you have looked for ways to support people in the WBFI family in these difficult times. I have not heard of any other federation helping their members with funding for people who are going through economic hardship. That sends a message that I always tell our athletes, ‘Take care of the team and the team will take care of you’. It is about just refusing to let something fall short, and the sheer force of will, to get something new going.”
 Wheelchair basketball athletes are currently fanned out across the nation, practising at gymnasiums and homes, as sports facilities slowly limp back to normalcy. The players are looking forward to practising as a team, as soon as the cloud of the pandemic lifts, and it’s safe to play in the same court.

The goal of MGI is to advocate and invest in a program to provide an income floor by sending monthly cash payments to individuals. The money is "unconditional, with no strings attached and no work requirements," MGI's website says.
 "We are a nation in crisis and the last one of this scale yielded dramatic social reform; this is our New Deal Movement," Tubbs said. "We need a social safety net that goes beyond conditional benefits tied to unemployment, works for everyone and begins to address the call for racial and economic justice through a guaranteed income. These pilots and the resulting evidence will be instrumental in shaping what the 2021 social contract looks like in America."
 The funds provided by Dorsey are already being used to launch or expand guaranteed-income pilots in Los Angeles; New Orleans; Pittsburgh; Columbia, South Carolina; Madison, Wisconsin; Richmond, Virginia; Tacoma, Washington; and Saint Paul, Minnesota, among others.

TUI is preparing intensively for a new start in 2021 after the corona crisis year 2020. The pandemic is not over, but there is light at the end of the tunnel and the prospects for tourism and for TUI are good. The demand for holiday travel is there – consumers in all age groups say that travelling is one of the most missed activities for them in the Corona year. 2021 will be a transition year for tourism, and 2022 is expected to see a return to pre- Corona levels. In particular, the holiday sector will recover faster than the sector as a whole. TUI had made an excellent start to the financial year before the outbreak of the pandemic, but the worldwide travel warnings since March 2020 then forced the Group to largely discontinue business. Among other things, there was no Easter business, no travel at Whitsun and only very limited summer business in the Corona crisis year 2020. The Group introduced cost-cutting and financing measures at an early stage and accelerated the global realignment. In addition to securing additional liquidity, extensive cost-cutting projects were launched. The long-term goal of reducing annual costs has been raised from the previous 300 million euros to the current 400 million euros.

According to the complaint, the woman began working at Hans and Franz in 2016 and became a cook at the restaurant in 2018. During her time working there, the suit claims, Sulley consistently made comments about her appearance, told her she should "draw more attention to herself by wearing makeup, skirts, and high-heeled shoes," and told her at least once that, "he would like to see her wear high-heeled shoes and an apron and nothing else."
 The suit alleges Sulley touched her inappropriately when they were in a room alone or when other employees weren't watching. The complaint includes screen shots of a sexually explicit text message Sulley sent the employee and photos of sexual gifts he allegedly gave her.
 In his response, Sulley admitted to sending the text but denied giving her the gift.
 In 2018, the suit states, the woman spilled grease on her torso while removing meat from the oven because it was "improperly placed on a nonperforated pan," and sustained first, second and third-degree burns. Sulley saw the injury and restaurant management gave her over the counter burn cream and wrapped the burn in cellophane, according to the complaint. The woman then continued to work for "approximately six and a half hours after she was burned."
 The suit states that Sulley told the woman he would file a workers' compensation claim related to her injury and advised her not to seek medical attention until he told her to do so. When the plaintiff went to another job the next day, her boss there took a photo of her injuries and sent it to Sulley and a doctor.

“‘I am forced,’ said Mr. Balfour, ‘to the conclusion that now, for the first time in modern history, we are face to face with a naval situation so new and so dangerous that it is difficult for us to realize all its import.”1 Germany had launched its fourth dreadnought in four years and Britain was nervous. The Royal Navy had ruled the waves since Admiral Horatio Nelson’s victory at Trafalgar. But the international situation in the early 20th century was anything but certain as Britain and Germany embarked on an arms race, and with the United States and Japan close behind. After World War I, most of the major naval powers realized these enormous ships would only get larger, keeping all of them locked in an arms race when the world was supposed to be permanently at peace.

Going through the exhibition can be a moving experience if you pause to consider that a photograph from 150 years ago is more than the image on its surface; it’s a physical artifact that has survived two world wars, natural disasters, mishandling and natural deterioration. You can stand in the exhibition and look directly at the product of groundbreaking moments.
 What kinds of milestones do these photos show? The first Japanese people to be photographed. The first photographs taken on Japanese soil. The first photograph of a Japanese emperor. Smaller achievements are also marked, such as works by the first photographers to work in Gunma and Chiba prefectures, as well as other inland locations on the Kanto Plain, where it took longer for new technologies to arrive.
 The stories behind the images are compelling. The first photographs ever taken of Japanese people, for example, were taken not in Japan, but in the United States in 1851 or 1852. This was a time when Japan had a strict policy of national isolation and its citizens were forbidden, upon pain of death, from leaving the country. How, then, were these subjects photographed?
 A year earlier, a small Japanese ship was sailing near the country’s coast when it lost its mast and was blown off course. After drifting at sea for a month and a half, the crew was finally rescued by the Auckland, an American whaling ship. They were taken to safety in San Francisco, where a photographer made daguerreotype portraits of each crew member. Two of these portraits, now in the collection of the Kawasaki City Museum, are included in this exhibition.
 They almost weren’t, however, because the Kawasaki museum’s underground storage rooms were flooded in 2019 when the Tama River overflowed its banks. Much of the museum’s collection was destroyed, but the two portraits survived, thanks to quick action by the staff.
 The first photographs taken on Japanese soil also have a story of loss and survival. Written records show that in 1854, Eliphalet Brown Jr., a member of Commodore Matthew Perry’s expedition to open Japan’s ports, made several hundred daguerreotype photographs here. Some of these images were the basis for lithograph illustrations (as the technology to reproduce photographs on paper did not yet exist) included in the official record of the American expedition.

 "One of my main interests in the coming session of the Legislature will be to see some treatment given our wild lands of Northern Michigan," Senator Albert J. Engel of Lake City stated on a visit to Cadillac. "Having lived in this country practically all my life I know what eyesores these vast tracts of waste lands are, simply lying idle, the prey of every forest or brush fire that cares to sweep back and forth across them burning every bit of vitality from the soil. We have progressed far enough now that we know the lumber crop can be seeded, cultivated and harvested the same as a crop of potatoes. A bond issue to reforest would doubtless be paid off by the timber harvest in 50 years. Certainly some action should be taken to make our state as productive as possible and this is one of the possibilities. While stationed at Coblenz with the army of occupation I saw enough scientific reforestation to prove to me that Europe, in this respect, has out-distanced us. Of course her forests were devastated the same as ours have been but we should not wait until we are face to face with the shortage of timber which faced Central Europe before she started to replant her wild land. By taking action soon we can keep a crop of timber ever available instead of going through a period of no production, a condition which is bound to occur unless steps are now taken to insure a continuous growing crop. The trouble with us in Northern Michigan is that we have lived close to the forests for so long that we can scarcely conceive of their passing. But haven't our hardwood tracts almost disappeared? The same condition is true of all wooded districts, and within a comparatively short time there will be a shortage of wood materials, which will seriously embarrass us. Now is the time to forestall such a condition."

That said, a few years down the road, the story might change. Many more vaccines may reach the market, and then, governments may have the necessary leverage to lower prices. Or they simply might switch to a vaccine deemed more efficacious, safer, or more practical. For the next couple of years, however, I expect Moderna and other early entrants to sell as many doses as they're able to produce -- as long as their vaccines continue to be safe and effective.

Yes and no! On the one hand, the process of designing, calculating and disseminating benchmarks in India is similar to other markets. The S&P; BSE Sensex, for example, is much the same today in terms of design as it was, nearly 40 years ago, when the index was launched. However, it is supported by a much deeper bench of infrastructure today. Nowadays, leading index providers like S&P; DJI have to rely on a broad base of policies, procedures and production expertise that add a level of independence, accuracy and transparency to our indices.

I co- present the podcast with my colleagues Stephen Bush and Ailbhe Rea – when the pandemic hit we went up from one to two a week in light of our listeners’ desire for information and analysis (and, in many cases, boredom at home!). To me, our future looks good as we’ve actually grown during the pandemic – we now have a data journalism team, for example, which has been amazing to work with. There have been redundancies at other publications though, which must be horrendous to go through and paints an uncertain picture.

These incidents have taken place in the context of a Prime Minister content to ignore both the recommendations of the Burns committee to reduce the size of the House of Lords, and his predecessor’s agreement to exercise restraint in the creation of life peers. While May restricted herself to creating 43 life peers, Johnson has already appointed 36. As well as coming under fire for appointing his friends and allies, the impact of such a sizeable majority of Conservative peers is to weaken the chamber’s power to conduct effective parliamentary oversight.

It is the ideal blend for me of reporting on the impact of politics and policy on people’s day-to-day lives, and focusing on stories around the country as part of our 'Crumbling Britain' series on the impact of austerity, and 'Britain’s Lost Spaces', which investigates the loss of public places to meet, civic infrastructure and decline of the public realm – a major shift that I think is underreported. Each of these series and similar projects allow me to take one place or service or person as a case study and report on a wider trend. Unfortunately during the pandemic, I haven’t managed to get out and about as much as I’d hoped to.

In this context, _Blood Hails Steel - Steel Hails Fire_ is an instant classic, as it could have existed along with the defining works of those pioneers during the heyday of the genre, and be counted as a proper gem.

While it's meaty riffs, galloping rhythms, nifty songwriting, gruff vocal delivery, and grandiose atmosphere carry a certain vintage patina, the music here is all the better for it.

It is important to understand what the government is proposing in the name of new reforms and an aim to turnaround India's agricultural sector, closing the disparity between agriculture and other sectors at large.
 The nationwide protests are being based on some misconceived facts about MSP, mandis, dealings with contractors, and more. In a nutshell, the Farm Laws 2020 does not take away the MSP, which in fact has witnessed an increase after the passing of the bill. APMC mandis will continue to work and farmers are given full control of pricing their produce even before growing it, something that has been in the hands of the contractors.
 The dairy and fisheries sectors are growing at an annual rate of 4 percent to 10 percent, while the growth in the food grain sector has been at an average of 1.1 percent annually after 2011-12. The need for new reforms come with the intention to benefit the farmers and double their income.

The culprit appears to be Carrier Services v50. Following the update, some Samsung, OnePlus, LG, Motorola, and TCL phones refused to send and receive SMS messages, as reported by 9to5Google and on Reddit. Many affected users have turned to their carriers for support since they rightfully assumed it was an issue on their end, with support representatives investigating but unable to resolve the problem. It took some time until Redditors found out that the problem was caused by the Carrier Services app, and then some more until some of our regular tipsters noticed that the Play Store automatically downgraded them from v50 to the previous release, v48.

 “No-huddle, that’s kind of the big thing that everyone’s talking about right now,” the coach said. “We’ve just got to do a good job of executing. You can no-huddle, you can huddle, you can do whatever you want. But if you don’t execute, none of it works.”
 Offensive coordinator Chan Gailey might have been trying to throw the Chiefs off, but he was more enthusiastic about the potential role of no-huddle with Tagovailoa going forward.
 “We will continue to use it,” Gailey said. “How much? I think it will depend on the game; it will depend on the situation. We felt like that would help us in the second half of the last game, and obviously it did.”
 After Miami went up-tempo, Tagovailoa completed 13 of 16 passes for 167 yards during three third-quarter possessions, each of which resulted in a score. He looked more decisive, with quick releases that further fueled the offense’s acceleration.
 “When you’re on the ball and you’re going fast, it confuses the defense,” Tagovailoa said. “They need to get lined up, and can’t get their call in at times. Then when you have guys motioning, it confuses their call if they have a blitz on, or the coverage they’re going to run.”
 The Dolphins’ disruptive defense has allowed Tagovailoa to be primarily a caretaker quarterback so far, and he has been adequate in that role, throwing no interceptions while going 4-1 as a starter.
 Against the Chiefs he’ll likely need to be more aggressive, because Miami might need a lot of points to win.
 Not that Tagovailoa ever expected a smooth ride.
 “Adversity has always been in my life,” he said. “That’s just life. And in the NFL, it’s a continuous learning process.”

The schools ended up offering evening classes from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. And Hodge jumped at the opportunity.
 "The school was a big stressor for me, for myself and the kids," she said. Night school "alleviated a lot of the stress and anxiety and also my worries of 'Is she getting the adequate quality education that a kindergartener should be able to get?' "
 Eger was at first hesitant to take on the night classes but then volunteered for the extra hours.
 During the day, she has 28 students online. Then 11 more at the evening classes.
 The results were immediate. And long lasting.
 "We have a few scholars that were absent the majority of September and almost all of October, but then the second we started the evening learning program, they have not missed one day," she said.
 "Now, getting into end of week nine, I'm seeing a big difference. I'm seeing most of the kids sitting down, staying seated, their eyes are on the screen, they're doing the work."
 It's not the in-person classroom learning that teachers, children and parents yearn for, but both Hodge and Eger say they see the students forming relationships as well as learning their numbers and ABCs -- all critical parts of kindergarten.
 Night classes for both Vanessa and herself means more scheduling and prioritizing for Hodge but she is happy that her younger daughter understands you're supposed to go to school every day.
 "It's been really hard doing this on my own and working in the hospital, trying to make ends meet and being able to go to school to further my education," Hodge said. "I'm very fortunate that she's able to have a school that puts parents at top notch of priorities."
 She looks forward to Vanessa and Gianna getting back to being in school full time, mostly because that's what they need. But it will also give Hodge a little break on her days off -- perhaps for some time to herself or at least the chance to do the laundry in peace.

Payne County Election Board Secretary Dondee Klein said her staff was originally told it did not matter if the addresses on their official voter registration records were outside the city limits as long as they gave an address within the city limits on the petition.
 That should not have been the case, McNickle said.
 The tighter rules resulted in 17 signatures being removed from the 425 on Mayor Will Joyce’s recall and 16 signatures being removed from Vice Mayor Pat Darlington's 421, Amy Dzialowski’s 418, John Wedlake’s 416 and Alane Zannotti’s 414, Payne County Election Board Secretary Dondee Klein confirmed.
 Each petition required at least 416 signatures from people who are registered to vote within the Stillwater city limits. Counts under the revised instructions dropped all five petitions below the required number of signatures.
 An amended certification of signature counts was issued by the election board at 4 p.m. Wednesday, according to a City of Stillwater release.
 On Monday, McNickle and City Attorney John Dorman said four of the five petitions submitted had enough verified signatures to force a recall election for Joyce, Darlington, Dzialowski and Wedlake.
 Only the petition to recall Zannotti was judged to have fallen short at that time.
 A certification was issued that day.

While it's true that a company needs great performance over time to be big enough to enter a benchmark, there are many, many companies that will never make it. If you knew which company was going to make the grade, then it will probably be a good investment. There is some evidence to suggest that - over the long term - smaller stocks generate higher average returns than larger stocks, albeit with higher levels of risk. But even then, the data is open to different interpretations. Over the past decade, larger stocks have generally outperformed in most major equity markets. In many cases, the investor may chose a balance of larger and smaller companies - both the established, higher-quality names of today, and the potentially more risky, but potentially higher-growth companies for the future.

 The UK economic recovery nearly stalled in October as the services sector was hit by Covid-19 restrictions before the full lockdown in November.
 Output grew 0.4 per cent in October compared with the previous month, down from 1.1 per cent in September and the lowest rate since May, data from the Office for National Statistics showed on Thursday.
 Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician for economic statistics at the ONS said: “Public services output increased, while car manufacturing continued to recover and retail again grew strongly. However, the reintroduction of some restrictions saw services growth hit, with large falls in hospitality, meaning the economy overall grew only modestly.”
 The near stagnation left the economy 8.2 per cent smaller than in October last year and 7.9 per cent smaller than in February, before the pandemic.
 A full recovery is key for the survival of businesses and jobs, but the Office for Budget Responsibility, the fiscal watchdog, does not expect the UK economy to reach its pre-virus level until the end of 2022.
 All sectors registered a slowdown in growth, with output in the services sector, which bears the brunt of the Covid-19 restrictions and accounts for 80 per cent of the economy, only growing 0.2 per cent month-on-month in October, down from 1 per cent growth in September.
 Output in the services sector was still 8.6 per cent down on the level in February, a larger fall than for the other sectors.
 The accommodation and food service activities subsector dragged on growth in October, falling by 14.4 per cent month on month as tightening coronavirus measures hit demand.
 Output in manufacturing and construction recovered to about 6.5 per cent below pre-pandemic levels in October, helped by the recovery of international demand and by the strong housing market.
 Samuel Tombs, chief UK Economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, expects the UK economy to shrink 5 per cent in November compared to October as a result of the month-long lockdown in England.
 The UK is one of the few countries that produces monthly GDP data, but quarterly figures for the three months to September revealed that compared to the last three months of 2019, output fell more in the UK than any other G7 country.

Common wisdom considers the freedom from constraints to produce more creative solutions, but constraints actually produce better outcomes. Creativity is enhanced by embracing constraints.12 The Navy knew that it needed a new class of warships rapidly—the competing powers were all doing the same. The General Board felt international pressure to produce an affordable, minimum viable design to the maximum limits allowed by treaty as quickly as possible. Only an iterative approach would work to optimize these constraints, and the Board knew that it could not wait for new technologies to mature before producing the new class. The _Pensacola_ -class cruisers were therefore designed for fast, independent steaming and long-range gunnery performance, reflecting the Board’s desires. Achieving this required the Board to sacrifice much of the armor and cram as much weaponry as they could into the design, earning the class the nickname ‘tinclads.’

At the time cruiser production took approximately three years per ship. The Navy would normally have waited for the _Pensacola_ to deliver and be put through sea trials and a myriad of experiments before making revisions or designing a new class. But other major powers were laying down cruisers just as quickly, forcing “successive classes…to be designed and ordered before their predecessors had been completed (or even launched), so modifications had to be made on a theoretical basis without the benefit of trials and operational service.”16 Thankfully the Navy only ordered the _Pensacola_ and the _Salt Lake City_. The class did not keep well at sea. Their dimensions and top-heavy design made them prone to large rolls and the low freeboard meant that water shipped over the sides easily.17

At their last summit in October, the leaders offered trade and other incentives to Turkey to halt its “illegal activities.” But EU foreign ministers agreed this week that things have only got worse, and the Europeans are concerned that their credibility is on the line if they don't act. Last year, the EU set up a system for imposing travel bans and asset freezes on people, companies or organizations linked to contested drilling activities. Two Turkish Petroleum Corporation officials are already on the list.

So what could be the financial impact of Apple reducing commissions across the board? Apple takes a 30% cut on App sales and subscriptions (15% from the second year of subscriptions) and we estimate that total commission revenues stood at almost $20 billion in FY’19 (out of a total of about $46 billion in Services Revenue). If Apple reduced commissions to say 20% from 30%, it would reduced total commissions by about $7 billion to roughly $13 billion. Although the revenue impact would be limited for Apple (under 3% of Apple’s Total Revenue) the impact on profits would be more pronounced given that commissions are likely to be almost entirely profit. We estimate that Apple’s Operating Income would be about 10% lower if commissions were reduced, considering Apple posted about $64 billion in Operating Income in FY’19.

Economic stimulus programs, federal and state, designed to combat the COVID-19 downturn come in a number of forms, yet we seniors will benefit from virtually none of them.
 Still we have to pay the same high prices for everything as do others, including the egregiously high, government-created and enforced “legalized extortion” called property taxes.
 We don’t benefit from payroll protection plans that continue paychecks; we don’t get unemployment checks or extended federal unemployment checks; you’ll seldom see our gray hair in food bank lines; nor are we generally eligible for rent relief. Most of us don’t get yearly bonuses or an annual increase in salary, yet we face the same escalating costs of living that others do, but must do it on fixed incomes. Where is the consideration?
 State and local governments only look at us and our property as ATMs to be tapped whenever they need more money. The state hands out tax loopholes all over the place, including monster breaks to big businesses that then move out of state, yet can’t help seniors unless their income is at poverty levels. Where is the consideration?

The export-import (EXIM) trade in Cochin Port is pushing shipping lines to start main line services in the wake of the worsening congestion at Colombo Port through which India ships three-fourths of its transshipment cargo.
 The demand for direct services from Cochin Port comes after feeder ship operators plying between Cochin and Colombo cut services by half.
 Colombo, a regional transshipment hub, has been hit by the fall-out of the pandemic, and a strike called by port workers recently had escalated the logjam, further delaying the turnaround of mainline vessels for transshipment.
 Cochin Port Users Forum has asked shipping lines to connect their feeder service operating between India’s East-West routes to Cochin Port and start direct service with transshipment cargo, thereby avoiding Colombo Port.
 Prakash Iyer, Chairman of the Users Forum told _BusinessLine_ that the trade is losing heavily because of the delay in Colombo, resulting in a surge in freight rate to $4,000 for 40-ft containers and $2,300 for 20-ft containers. The increase was almost 100 per cent compared to 2019 rates, he said.
 To ease the situation, Iyer urged the authorities to make alternate arrangements for starting a common feeder service between Kochi and Singapore so that transshipment cargoes from these regions can be moved from Far Eastern ports. He also pointed out that the absence of empties has forced exporters to bring in boxes by road and move it to Chennai for sailing, incurring extra costs.
 P Subramaniam, President, Coimbatore Custom House and Steamer Agents Association urged feeder vessel operators to ensure scheduled sailings between Kochi and Colombo and asked the terminal operator to give prioritised berthing for the time being.
 He also requested the Cochin Port Trust authorities and the terminal operator to consider complete waiver of terminal ground rent as a temporary relief for the users.
 “The port and DP World are in discussions with two major shipping lines for bringing direct mainline services. We are hopeful of getting those in the interim, _ad hoc_ calls of mainline and feeders to continue, which will help the trade”, a senior official in the port said. An _ad hoc_ feeder vessel is expected to call next week. Shipping lines are also evaluating various options for routing their containers, the official said adding, that the port is ready to facilitate in case of any support that the lines may require.
 Kerala’s seafood and coir exporters have also been hit ahead of the Christmas and New Year season. The situation has led to shortage of refrigerated containers, missed schedules and inventory holding has forced buyers to cancel orders, according to marine food product exporters.

Anche in questo periodo di perdurante emergenza sanitaria, costante è l’azione delle Fiamme Gialle della “Granda” nel contrasto a tutti gli illeciti economico-finanziari. Questa volta, al fine di tutelare i diritti dei consumatori, i Finanzieri del Nucleo di Polizia Economico Finanziaria di Cuneo e della Tenenza di Fossano hanno intensificato i servizi di controllo economico del territorio, con specifiche attività rivolte al contrasto della commercializzazione di prodotti privi dei dati tecnici e delle istruzioni per l’utilizzo.
 Tali informazioni devono essere scritte in lingua italiana in modo da consentire all’utilizzatore finale l’identificazione del produttore, dell’eventuale importatore, del Paese d’origine se extra UE. Inoltre devono riportare la descrizione delle proprietà funzionali nonché la natura e/o le caratteristiche del prodotto, le precauzioni da porre in essere durante l’utilizzo e la destinazione d'uso, al fine di consentirne la fruizione in sicurezza ed evitare eventuali pericoli derivanti da un uso improprio.
 Nel corso di controlli nei confronti di esercenti di nazionalità cinese di Ceva e Savigliano sono stati rinvenuti e sottoposti a sequestro circa 700 prodotti (giocattoli, accessori per la scuola, orologi, accessori di abbigliamento, prodotti per la telefonia, lampadine ed oggetti di bigiotteria) privi di qualsiasi informazione, in violazione a quanto disposto dal Codice del Consumo.
 Agli esercenti è stata contestata, ai sensi dell’art. 12 del citato Codice, sanzioni fino a 50.000 euro. Al termine dell’iter amministrativo, qualora i prodotti sequestrati non saranno regolarizzati, si procederà alla loro distruzione.

 City Manager Norman McNickle told the News Press the Payne County Election Board was given incorrect instructions about which signatures should be considered valid. According to the city charter, only people who were registered voters and eligible to vote in city elections at the time they signed the petition should have been counted, he said.
 The Election Board was originally given instructions to count signatures from registered voters who provided addresses within the Stillwater city limits on the petition form.
