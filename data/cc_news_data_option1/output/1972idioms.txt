Trump has promised to build 450 miles of wall along the border with Mexico by the end of the year. So far, the government has awarded millions of dollars in contracts for construction of 30-foot-tall barriers, along with new lighting, technology and infrastructure. The Trump administration says it has already built 187 miles of wall. Some of it is new, but most is replacing old, much shorter barriers that officials say were not sufficient.

"This child has lost innocence that can never be restored on replaced," Sader stated. "I've been involved in the criminal justice system for over 30 years. From that standpoint, this is one of the most vile and horrific cases I have ever experienced in the criminal justice system."
 Prosecuting Attorney George Sitler asked the court to impose the maximum penalty.
 Haway was sentenced to a term of 25 to 100 years on both counts of first- degree sexual assault, which will run currently. She received another five to 25 years on both counts of first-degree sexual abuse, which will run concurrently. Sadler also sentenced her to serve 10 to 20 years in prison for two counts of sexual abuse by a parent, guardian or custodian. Those sentences will run concurrently. She will also serve five to 15 years on each of the two incest charges, which will run concurrently.
 Sitler estimated that this gave Haway a sentence of 45 to 155 years in prison. She will be about 88 years old when she is eligible for parole.
 Sadler informed Haway that if she is ever released from prison, she will be required to register with the West Virginia State Police as a sex offender and serve 20 years of supervision.

A Trump approval of Israel’s sovereignty over the settlements would merely recognize the realities of the Middle East, as did his previous moves to recognize Jerusalem as the Israeli capital or to bow out of the Iran nuclear deal. Then, as now, critics claimed these moves would set the region aflame. It’s likely that if Trump says yes to Israel this time, the reaction will again fall short of alarmist predictions.

Why, then, is Trump hesitating to give the Israelis the green light? One consideration is the theoretical hope that the Trump plan could work in a second term. An Israeli move predicated on the idea that the Trump plan has already failed because there is no prospect that the Palestinians will ever agree to any part of it would forestall this. It’s possible that the president may cling to hope that his “deal of the century” will ultimately succeed. But Abbas -- and any possible successor -- is incapable of accepting any pact that ends a century-old war on Zionism, because the Palestinian people will not accept such an admission.

Lewis Hamilton said Niki Lauda is with him "in spirit at every race" as the six-time world champion hailed the Austrian F1 legend on the first anniversary of his death.
 Three-time champion Lauda passed away just before last year's Monaco Grand Prix at the age of 70.
 As well as his battles on and off the track, Lauda played a key role in persuading Hamilton to leave McLaren for Mercedes seven years ago.
 "With Niki, bringing me to a team, convincing me to come to a team that at the time had a lot of success to come. I am grateful for the opportunity and forever love Niki," said Hamilton.
 "I know he is with us every race in spirit."
 Hamilton, speaking in a video tribute released by the world champions on Wednesday, admitted it was still tough to discuss the impact of Lauda, 12 months after his death.
 "Niki is someone who I miss and who I think we all miss dearly," said the British driver.
 "Probably the most fond memories I have are from my first conversations. We started talking some time in 2012 and I just remember being home during the day, having a call from Niki and he is trying to convince me to come to the team.
 "It was very cool to have a call from a world champion and an icon like Niki."

The Pentagon is pursuing two main types of hypersonic weapons. One, called a hypersonic glide vehicle, is launched from a rocket. It then glides to a target, maneuvering at high speed to evade interception. The other is sometimes referred to as a hypersonic cruise missile. Capable of being launched from a fighter jet or bomber, it would be powered by a supersonic combustion ramjet, or scramjet, enabling the missile to fly and maneuver at lower altitudes.

The Toggl Button extension adds a simple one-click solution to start tracking the time you work on a project, but you can also use it as a Pomodoro timer, which you can activate in the extension's settings. Pomodoro is a technique that has you fully focused on a task for 25 minutes, followed by a 5-minute break. Thus, the extension lets you see how much time you spend on a project and provides you with predefined breaks, which could help you get some routine.

The effect was saving roughly 275 jobs at more than 60 Southern Nevada businesses and nonprofits, a successful marriage of public and private funding to support employers and employees impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Some of those jobs and businesses are in Laughlin.
 Jackie Mazzeo, president and CEO of the Laughlin Chamber of Commerce, was tasked with identifying businesses that fit the program criteria and were considered both deserving and in need of assistance.
 “The vetting process wasn’t difficult,” Mazzeo said. “I was entrusted by the Layoff Aversion Program to identify small businesses that were maintaining employees, were in good standing with reporting agencies and displayed passion or providing a service and/or product to the community
 of Laughlin.
 “I am grateful for the opportunity to build a relationship with each business and honored to award these businesses with these grants. Congratulations to Bruce’s Taste of Chicago, Mama’s Pizza, Humberto’s, and the Chuckwagon Restaurant inside the Regency. I am proud of each business for their compliance and provisions of curb-side service with variety.”
 She added “good luck!” to those businesses, all of whom have kept the faith in trying times and remain standing due in part to this pilot program which came in the nick of time for some.
 Bruce’s Taste of Chicago’s Bruce and Brandie Munro said that one of their fryers had just gone out the night before, adding additional expense to their struggle to stay solvent amid the ongoing COVID-19 crisis. All of the recipients were surprised and said they were very pleased to have been not only recognized for their efforts in the face of adversity, but to have been chosen to receive the assistance right when it was needed most.
 “”We were very grateful to be chosen. It couldn’t have come at a better time, and it was just a real bright spot, a ray of hope.” Brandi Munro said.
 Sheila, the owner of Mama’s Pizza, said it was a “huge blessing,” and “super helpful.”

In a criminal complaint, Sommers stated that he reviewed the video file and it showed an adult male engaging in a sexual act with a prepubescent female child. Sommers also found graphic messages between Haway and another Facebook user, according to the complaint. He then obtained and served a search warrant on Facebook, compelling them to disclose Facebook records for Haway.
 “As I searched her Facebook records further, I found two video files that were approximately 3 minutes and 21 seconds (each) in length that had been sent to another Facebook user,” Sommers stated in the complaint. After viewing the video file that included audio, he saw that it showed an adult female with the prepubescent female engaging in sexual acts.
 “I estimated the age of the child to be between 5 and 6 years of age,” Sommers said in the report. “I also observed that the bathtub had distinct cracking of the molding at the wall and bathtub and that the adult female had a tattoo on her finger of a smiley face (two dots and a line).”
 Sadler said as he sentenced Haway that "lifelong damage has been inflicted on this child."

First there was "The Trip," a six-part, three-hour BBC TV series with Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon playing Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon ... or at least fairly close versions of themselves. The show presented them as friends or, more accurately, close acquaintances who, between acting jobs, got a writing assignment to drive through the north of England, hop from hotel to hotel, and eat lunches in fancy restaurants, then report on the experiences. The charm of the whole thing was captured in their conversations, most involving history and pop culture and any topic imaginable practically in between. The charm of that charm was in full flower when the discussions started including impersonations of celebrities - Michael Caine and Sean Connery among them - and an ever-spiraling sense of competition between the two guys over who could do the better one.      It was a wonderfully entertaining and meandering series of half-hour shows which were eventually edited into the feature film "The Trip." Which begat the series and the movies "The trip to Italy" and "The Trip to Spain," and has now resulted in the fourth and supposedly final installment, "The Trip to Greece." More driving, hotels, restaurants, conversation and imitations.      But the shows and films haven't been just a lot of goofiness. In and around all of the talking, viewers have been treated to two spot-on improvisors - and gifted imitators - who are operating with all pistons firing, and are regularly and successfully trying to crack each other up. But there's much more, and credit goes to the creator and director Michael Winterbottom, who has seamlessly instilled a serious side of things, a sense of gravitas, that keeps everything in balance.      These are comedies, but wrapped up inside them are personal issues that reveal what's making these characters tick. Truth be told, Coogan and Brydon are so good at this sort of thing, it's very difficult to pinpoint where the real people and their characters diverge. In previous entries, there have been looks at the relationship between Coogan and his son (Tim Leach) and the relationship between Brydon and his wife (Rebecca Johnson), and not all has been rosy. In "The Trip to Greece," the thin plotline brings in heartfelt and serious thoughts of mortality.      But, yes, it's still a comedy, and although Coogan and Brydon present it as a continuation of what they've done before, they make sure to infuse it with a breath of freshness. As does Winterbottom.      The director chose Greece partially because of the country's beauty, but also because of its history and its myths. The route he puts his protagonists on distantly mirrors the one taken by Odysseus in "The Odyssey." The actors - driving and eating and chattering away - let pieces of their real lives seep into their discussions, and they up the ante in the impressions competition (my favorites include a meeting between Stan Laurel - who Coogan played in the film "Stan & Ollie" \- and Tom Hardy, and one involving British actor Ray Winstone if he were to play Henry VIII) and, this time, even get into a physical contest over a swimming challenge.      As in the previous TV shows and films, there are six lunches, brief peeks - in extreme close-up - of the meals being prepared in restaurant kitchens, and visits by a couple of women from their publication. One of the odder things about all of this is that neither Coogan nor Brydon seem all that knowledgeable about the food they eat or the wine they drink. Or maybe that's just how they're playing the parts. But they certainly come across as an educated, well read pair of travelers with both shared and completely different interests in what they're seeing and talking about.      If this does turn out to be the final "Trip" film, that'll be too bad, because these have always been a joy to return to. But it also makes sense to end it here, as the Odysseus story is about going on and ending an extended voyage. To be sure, this has been a funny, thoughtful, long, strange one.      "The Trip to Greece" will be available on cable and digital VOD starting May 22.      Ed Symkus can be reached at esymkus@rcn.com.
