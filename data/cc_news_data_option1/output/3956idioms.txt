A former sub-postmaster says he is "over the moon" after the Post Office said it would not be challenging an appeal to quash convictions for theft and fraud.
 Noel Thomas, from Anglesey, was one of hundreds prosecuted when new computer systems installed in 1999 started reporting accounting errors.
 He was jailed, lost his home and was made bankrupt as a result.
 The decision paves the way for Mr Thomas and others to clear their names.
 The Post Office announced on Friday it would not contest 44 out of 47 appeals being heard for sub-postmasters and postmistresses following the Horizon computing system scandal, including that of Mr Thomas.

“I just trained him,” he said. “I always run fit horses. I don’t know why people use the word ‘hard.’”
 He also thought too much was made of Authentic’s unfocused finish in winning the Haskell, noting that the horse needs constant encouragement down the stretch and that jockey Mike Smith let up because he had a big lead. Smith did not see Ny Traffic pulling close as the finish line approached.
 “He wasn’t tired or anything,” Baffert said. “It looked like life and death, but I know the horse really well.”
 With John Velazquez riding him in the Derby, Authentic showed his mettle by pulling away after Tiz the Law challenged at the top of the stretch.
 “To turn the tables on him, we’re going to have to improve or he’s going to have to not run as well as he did in the Derby, and I don’t see any of that happening at this point in time, as far as him not bringing his A game,” said Bret Calhoun, who trained Mr. Big News to a third-place finish in the Derby and will take another shot at Authentic in the Preakness. “Based off the race in the Haskell, you thought the mile and a quarter might be an Achilles' heel for him, but obviously, he proved everyone wrong. He set hot early fractions, and he carried it.”
 Baffert believes the pandemic actually helped Authentic by pushing the Derby to September and the Preakness to October. While the timing proved ruinous for Nadal and Charlatan, it allowed Authentic to mature into his considerable tools.
 “To me, I think he’s getting better,” Baffert said. “You can tell he’s filling out. … He’s just turned into such a superior animal.”
 It’s the kind of superlative he applied to his two Triple Crown winners, American Pharoah and Justify. He also still believes in Thousand Words, the “quirky” colt who won the Aug. 1 Shared Belief Stakes before he acted up at the Derby.
 “That was just a freaky thing,” Baffert said. “He got mad, went up and his hind legs went out from under him. He’s always been tough to saddle. You have to saddle him on the walk and when you stop, he gets mad. He’s not that bad, but you have to keep moving. Then once he has the saddle on, he’s fine.”
 He promised his team (sans Barnes, who’s still laid up with nine screws in his surgically repaired wrist) won’t make the same mistake at Pimlico.
 “He’s got a lot of speed,” Baffert said of the former $1-million yearling purchase. “He’s not as quick as Authentic, but if he can get in a nice rhythm and be right there, who knows? … He was so immature. Mentally, he’s starting to catch up. But he’s always been a bit of a slow learner.”

James Garner, 48, owner of Godwick Great Barn near Fakenham, praised his team after a last minute dash to put together a wedding bash for a couple who had seen their planned celebration cancelled at the last minute. The couple, who do not wish to be named, were desperate to have their event on September 26 before new restrictions came into force, which would have meant only 15 people would be allowed at their wedding. Mr Garner met with the couple mid-morning on the Wednesday, September 23, where he spoke to them for the first time. Just 72 hours later, their big day was ready to go. Despite this tight turnaround, Mr Garner said the end result was worth it. "The joy and celebration that you see on their wedding days - it's what we thrive on," he said. "Like a lot of businesses, we thrive on working short notice, trying to work in quick turnarounds and being quick on our feet. "We were fortunate that the couple had things organised from their previous venue, and it was about getting their stuff to Godwick and how it would fit in." The couple were married at church before heading onto the barn for a socially distanced celebration. The barn hosted 30 people who were seated for the celebrations, with table service and socially distanced rules in place. Prior to this celebration, the barn has only hosted one ceremony, in a year they were due to host around 50. Mr Garner said not seeing these events happen was deeply upsetting. "None of that has been happening, it has been upsetting for the team so it is lovely to see people coming together to celebrate what we do and we love seeing it. "We miss the couples desperately, it is the heart and soul of our business. "It is not just from the point-of-view of getting married, but the joy and celebration that you see on their wedding days."
