WASHINGTON — If you’re planning to travel by air during the holiday season, here are some steps that you can take right now to help ensure that you avoid Santa’s “Naughty” list when you get to a Transportation Security Administration (TSA) security checkpoint at the airport. Because TSA is well- aware that many people haven’t traveled in several months, here is what you need to do now to be prepared this holiday season - whether you’re traveling for Hanukkah, Christmas, Kwanzaa or to celebrate the New Year.

Alleging that the BJP was blatantly misusing powers to win the GP polls by hook or crook, the former MP said that Congress workers must keep a round the clock watch on BJP’s money spending spree. Pointing out that the party has come with plans to win more than what it had secured five years ago, he said that it was the Congress who introduced the Panchayat Raj  system. Charging the BJP of making attempts to weaken the GP system, he said that the party workers should ensure that Congress gets the upper hand in this election, which is vital for strengthening the party at the grassroot level.

Gaston County commissioners are expected to vote Tuesday on whether to move ahead with a lawsuit filed last month against The Gaston Gazette.
   
 The story at the center of the suit had to do with how Gaston County commissioners handled worker's compensation claims filed by former county employees.
   
 County staff claimed the story was inaccurate, and on Nov. 12, the day the story was published online at GastonGazette.com, demanded a retraction and apology. The story appeared in The Gazette's print edition the following day.
   
 The county's elected board will decide Tuesday whether to set aside up to $100,000 in county funds to retain legal representation for the a libel lawsuit against The Gazette, Managing Editor Kevin Ellis, and reporter Adam Orr.
   
 Commissioners plan to hire the Charlotte law firm of Pope Aylward Sweeney & Stephenson, according to a letter provided by the county. Lead attorney Jeremy A. Stephenson would charge the county $225 per hour for his services.
   
 The suit was filed in Gaston County Superior Court on Nov. 23 after The Gazette published an article with a headline that read "Gaston commissioners settle nearly $400K in claims behind closed doors."
   
 Commissioners claim in the lawsuit that the story maliciously defamed commissioners causing them personal and professional damage.
   
 Charlotte attorney Jonathan Buchan, who is representing the newspaper in this lawsuit, said the editorial staff was doing what community journalism should do.
   
 "It is The Gazette's job to shed light on how the commissioners handle their official duties, and that appears to have made these elected officials uncomfortable," he said in a written statement.
   
 The article
   
 The article describes how commissioners met in closed session to discuss four workman compensation claims between February and August 2020.
   
 Those settlements were not made public until a reporter requested closed- session minutes on Oct. 15. According to the article, after that request, commissioners voted Oct. 27 to approve the minutes of those meetings. The article noted that at least one of the former employees had already been paid $35,000 in June.
   
 The suit
   
 County commissioners allege in the lawsuit that the article inaccurately depicted how the worker's compensation claims were approved.
   
 "Commissioners authorized the settlements of these claims without a record of a vote being taken while meeting in closed session," the article says.
   
 According to the lawsuit, commissioners signed off on the settlements when they approved the overall consent agenda on Oct. 27.
   
 The next step
   
 Though the lawsuit was filed weeks ago, the board has not voted to take legal action.
   
 In a recent article by public radio station WFAE in Charlotte, Gaston County spokesman Adam Gaub said no such meeting had been held prior to the filing. According to that article, the action came after county commissioners spoke individually with the county attorney.
   
 Brooks Fuller, director of the North Carolina Open Government Coalition, told WFAE that it appears Gaston County commissioners may have violated the state's open meeting law in the way they filed the lawsuit.
   
 When commissioners decided to sue as a board, Fuller told WFAE, the decision should have been made at a meeting.
   
 "If they are going to discuss or deliberate anything that involves public business," he said, "they have to do so in an official meeting."

WASHINGTON (AP) - A proposed COVID-19 relief bill is expected to get backing from President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell but it won’t include $1,200 in direct payments to most Americans, a Republican senator involved in the bipartisan talks says.“President Trump has indicated that he would sign a $908 billion package — there’s only one $908 billion package out there and it’s ours,” Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., said Sunday. “The pain of the American people is driving this, and I’m optimistic that both those leaders will come on board.”With time running out, lawmakers from both parties were closing in on the final language that would provide roughly $300 in extra federal weekly unemployment benefits, leaving the issue of cash payments for President-elect Joe Biden to wrestle over with a new Congress next year.The package to be released Monday would be attached to a larger year-end spending bill needed to avert a government shutdown this coming weekend.The direct payments were popular when they were first distributed after the pandemic hit, and Biden on Friday had expressed hope that a second wave might come after weekend negotiations.But senators involved in the talks said the checks won’t be included as part of the compromise, even as Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and others said that could cause them to oppose the measure.Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the second-ranking Democrat, indicated that excluding the checks while assuring small-business aid and renters’ assistance was the only way to reach agreement with Republicans who are putting firm limits on the bill’s final price tag.“The $1,200 check, it cost we believe nationally $300 billion, to give you an idea,” he said. “The Democrats have always wanted a larger number, but we were told we couldn’t get anything through the Republicans, except this $900 billion level.”The plan being worked on by a group of Republican and Democratic senators is less than half of the Democrats’ push of $2.2 trillion and nearly double the $500 billion “targeted” package proposed by McConnell, R-Ky.Cassidy agreed that a new round of direct checks “may be a go” at some point. “This is not a stimulus bill, it’s a relief bill,” he said. “And it’s something for the next three to four months to help those in greatest need.”The proposal is expected to include the $300 per week in bonus federal unemployment payments, providing relief just as emergency aid payments at regular benefit levels are set to expire at year’s end. It would extend a freeze on evictions for people who cannot pay their rent and reauthorize the Paycheck Protection Program to give a second round of subsidies to businesses struggling through the pandemic.Still, potential sticking points remain.Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said last week they wouldn’t support the $908 billion proposal if it did not include checks for families, and were joined by Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo. Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez are also against shielding businesses from lawsuits claiming negligence for COVID-19 outbreaks, a provision pushed by Republicans.While favoring the $1,200 checks, Biden said the emerging compromise was “immediately needed” and that additional assistance could follow later.On Sunday, lawmakers involved in the negotiations said the direct payments would have to wait until after Biden is inaugurated on Jan. 20. At that time, Biden will face a new Congress as vaccines are being distributed, with a narrowed Democratic majority in the House and a closely divided Senate potentially split 50-50 if Democrats are able to prevail in two runoff elections in Georgia on Jan. 5.Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., said Sanders was not involved in the negotiations and “his characterization is just not accurate” about the potential liability protections for businesses. The direct payments, he said, will be a task for Biden.Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., said the bipartisan group was focused on extending the most urgent aid for the next four months.“Every indication says more money is needed; we see that,” he said. “This gets us through basically the lifelines that people need and the small businesses that can survive and not go under.”Manchin said Biden’s team, when in power, “can put together a different proposal that takes us further down the road for more recovery.”Durbin spoke on ABC’s “This Week,” Cassidy appeared on “Fox News Sunday,” Warner was on CNN’s “State of the Union” and Manchin was interviewed on NBC’s “Meet the Press.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

Starting January 2021, 92% of taxpayers under the Goods and Services Tax regime with an annual turnover of up to ₹5 crore can opt to file their returns once a quarter instead of the present monthly system, Department of Revenue officials said on Monday.
 As many as 94 lakh registered GST taxpayers can opt in for the new Quarterly filing of Return with Monthly Payment (QRMP) Scheme, under which GSTR-3B returns can be filed just once a quarter.
 “The small taxpayer, from January onward, would need to file only 8 returns (4 GSTR-3B and 4 GSTR-1 returns) instead of 16 returns at present in a financial year,” an official said, adding that taxpayers can join the scheme through the GST, with a facility to opt out or opt in again in the future, if one so wishes.
 The scheme, the official pointed out, was approved in-principle by the GST Council at its meeting on October 5 this year, with a view to provide flexibility to small and medium enterprises in GST compliance norms.
 While the move is expected to ease the compliance burden on indirect taxes for businesses, the Centre is also hoping to plug leakages and frauds by tightening the grant of input tax credits.
 “We are also introducing the concept of providing input tax credit only on reported invoices, which could significantly curb the menace of fake invoice frauds,” the official said.
 As part of an ongoing nationwide drive against fake invoice frauds, the GST intelligence wing and the CGST Commissionerates have arrested 114 unscrupulous persons besides booking 1230 cases against 3,778 fake GSTIN entities.

Restoration brings more benefits. Healthy mangroves mean healthy fish populations and a sustainably fishing economy. The tourism industry is also discovering the forests as a growing attraction that boosts the local economy. The Indonesian government is investing in mangrove restoration in an attempt to re-create a green-belt along the coast. But restoration is slow and existing forests are stressed. Van Bijsterveldt, saw attempts of planting new mangroves fail: 'There is so much focus on increasing the initial number of mangrove seedlings, that the challenges posed by plastic waste on the actual survival of young trees is overlooked'. Replanting mangroves without tackling the plastic problem is like trying to try to empty the ocean with a thimble. Successful restoration needs to go hand in hand with sustainable waste management.'

12 Marijuana Stocks to Buy Now
 There are now more than 50 publicly-traded companies operating in the cannabis industry. Most of these companies aren't directly growing and selling marijuana themselves, but they do stand to benefit greatly as more states legalize the sale and possession of marijuana. Some of these marijuana stocks are media companies. Others are privately studying the medical uses of marijuana. Yet others are providing tools and software for marijuana growers. As more cannabis companies file IPOs and enter the stock market, it will become increasingly difficult for investors to identify which marijuana stocks will truly benefit from the cannabis boom.

Still, a group known as the Abolish Slavery National Network (ASNN) believes one line in the Alabama state constitution left the door open for slavery to continue in 2020.A part of article 1, section 32 of the state’s constitution says, “otherwise than for the punishment of crime, of which the party shall have been duly convicted.”The ASNN says this excerpt has made slavery possible in 2020 through mass incarceration and other forms.Co-director of ASNN Max Parthas says this is something that many are miseducated about.“If it were a disease and many people were dying from it, the entire world would be going crazy, but because its black men and women going to prison, nobody cares, and that’s not acceptable in my book,” Parthas said.The organization held an event Sunday called “Slavery by Another Name,” where poets and activist voiced their concerns.Co-director Savannah Eldridge says it will take events like these to educate people on this issue and bring about change.“I think the key is having these town halls in different cities having this information sections getting with historians alike getting with them making sure they’re educating the young people and getting with our legislators and making sure they have the power to make change,” Eldridge said.In the last two years, the abolish slavery national network has been instrumental in removing pro-slavery language from three states. Nine states have ballot initiatives to do the same in 2021 through 2022.Copyright 2020 WSFA 12 News. All rights reserved.

In business, we talk about targets and achievements. Look at how much government has been releasing on one project or the other. What has become of such projects? The media is not helping matters. If government says we have allocated millions of naira somewhere, you should be able to find out where the money has gone to and what are the benefits of that? Let them come out with the statistics on what they achieved with it. We are fortunate to have this President (Buhari). When this government was coming in, we knew everybody had to sit up because he is a no-nonsense man.

From that game onwards, we always entered into the Cobbold stand and then our favourite steward would let us into the North Stand. I missed only a handful of games for the next few years before going on a run of 12 years without missing a single home game. My addiction was forever growing, a love that would surely stay with me forever.
 I’m not saying that my love is any less today – but I do question, for the first time ever, what it is all for.
 I’ve never felt as disillusioned about a manager before, and I’m afraid the worry must be that the club are going to lose fans if they don’t sort things out soon.

This year a lot of us have spent vast expanses of time isolated from family and friends — and so for many, this story will strike a chord. When van de Leun discusses pandemic lockdowns, she states, “Those who were alone began to physically throb for human connection.” This is a powerful concept — if we, with all the distractions of Zoom and Netflix and pets, can still ache for human connection when isolating, consider what it must feel like for those locked in solitary for months, with their senses so deprived of stimulation they magnify to “smell the guard’s perfume, hear the click of shoes echoing from far away.”

Beitar has the worst disciplinary record in Israel’s Premier League. Since 2005 it has faced more than 20 hearings and has received various punishments, including points deductions, fines and matches behind closed doors.
 The outfit is a bastion of Israel’s political right-wing and the only leading club in the Jewish state that has never signed an Arab player because of fan pressure.
 Beitar was Israel’s richest club until four seasons ago when its main financial backer, Russian-born billionaire Arkady Gaydamak, stopped most of his funding.
