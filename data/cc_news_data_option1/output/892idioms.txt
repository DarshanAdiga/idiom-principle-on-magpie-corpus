NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared more than 1,100 points, or 4.5%, Wednesday as governments and central banks around the globe took more aggressive measures to fight the virus outbreak and its effects on the economy. The gains more than recouped the market's big losses from a day earlier as Wall Street's wild, virus-fueled swings extend into a third week. Stocks rose sharply from the get-go, led by big gains for health care stocks after Joe Biden solidified his contender status for the Democratic presidential nomination.

FARGO, N.D. (AP) — Three attorneys who conducted an investigation into clergy sex abuse said Wednesday the North Dakota Legislature should open up the statute of limitations for civil lawsuits and demanded that the state's two Roman Catholic dioceses release more files on accused priests. The Fargo and Bismarck dioceses in January released a list of 53 clergy members with substantiated allegations of sexual abuse of a minor, but it did not include the assignment histories that were compiled and released Wednesday by attorneys Michael Bryant, Tatum O'Brien and Tim O'Keeffe. The lawyers said they hope their findings will help lay out timelines and encourage victims to come forward. “I think that it's really important for our victims to know and really important for the public to know where these priests were located at different times,” said O'Keeffe of Fargo. “Obviously it's a very private issue for the victims. It's a tough thing to talk about.” The dioceses said in a statement they have “permitted\" the North Dakota Bureau of Criminal Investigation to review the files for their deacons, priests and bishops, and said its investigation is almost complete. “The dioceses are confident that this external review will confirm that they have no clergy with substantiated allegations of sexual abuse of a minor remaining in ministry, and that they have had no substantiated allegations of any cleric’s sexual abuse of a minor for almost 20 years,” the dioceses' statement said. North Dakota Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem told The Associated Press the decision by the dioceses to open up their files “speaks well of at least their present commitment to do the right thing.” The lawyers also called for North Dakota to follow the path of several states that have passed laws creating a window for civil lawsuits...

Then Karl Rove took up the mantel. Mobilize your own base and forget bipartisan cooperation. Filibustering by the Democrat Senate hit all-time highs as cooperation broke down. Both sides were more concerned over winning and anyone willing to compromise was shown the door by voters. Republicans veered sharply right and Democrats swerved left. Not only Congress but voters became more polarized as the media and leaders accused each other of being “un-American” and each side comparing the other side to Nazi Germany.
 Then Obama gets elected and people hope things will change. But he is called a Muslim, a socialist, not a “real American” who wasn’t even born here. The other side questions his very right to be president. The “birther” movement accuses him of being born in Kenya. Even though we are in the “Great Recession,” Republicans try to obstruct everything he does. Obama responds by ramping up his executive orders and is called a dictator. Then Mitch McConnel refuses to give Obama a right to pick a Supreme Court nominee even though there are 10 months left in his term. The war is on. And it has gotten worse since then.
 Neither side can agree or even compromise on abortions, health care, the homeless, voting, gun control, religion, race relations, illegal immigration, climate change, the press, taxes and spending, or LGBTQ issues. Even science and facts are questioned. What is truth anymore? Nobody can agree.
 Democracy dies when there is no compromise – when everyone is polarized. It has happened before around the world. It has happened here. It is worse than just “nothing is getting done.” Democracy can collapse. Fascists and dictators or “strong leaders” fill the gap. The Russians and others don’t care who is in charge. They want chaos and dissent. They want us to fight each other because they know that is when democracy dies and we are weak. We are the great experiment in democracy. Others look to the “United” States of America to be their example. What are they thinking now?
 And God doesn’t care who is in charge. No one is going to “save” us from ourselves. Remember? We have free will. God cares more for the earth and its creatures. God cares about the sick, the poor, the elderly, the disabled, the hungry, the children – at least that was the example that Jesus gave us. We are supposed to love each other, even love our enemies.
 Democracy has always been rough and tumble. It’s messy. It’s not easy. You want to save this country and its democracy? Look for people who will unite not divide. Look for people who can work with the other side. Look for someone who can compromise to get things done. Look for someone who won’t demonize the other side about everything. Those people aren’t weak. They are incredibly strong to stand up against criticism from their own side. Let’s be the “United” States again.

Waverly Mayor Mike Werner said he provided the NDOT with the names of the major employers in Waverly to see if they are interested in partnering in the bus service.
 The planners are still working out exactly where all of the bus stops will be located. Fravel said feedback gathered during the stakeholders and public meetings this time around will be used to finalize the plans.
 On the Gold Route, the location of the stop in Waverly is still up in the air, the mayor said.
 “If this comes to be, they will work with the city to find the best logical space for the stop to be located,” Werner said.
 Once the bus service is successful, the mayor said he believes Waverly officials should look into offering more stops, including a park and ride lot in newly-developed areas along Highway 6.
 The buses will be operated by a contractor, but the amenities are already planned. Fravel said they will be nothing like commuter buses currently operating within Lincoln and Omaha.
 Instead, they will be coaches with amenities like bathrooms, Wi-Fi, charging stations, seat belts and bike racks. All buses will be wheelchair accessible as well.
 “It’s a different mode when you think about bus service,” said Fravel.
 The accommodations are a way to attract people to the service and were frequently mentioned by the public during earlier meetings, Donahue said. The expectation is for commuters to have the option to work, students to do homework and leisure travelers to have access to electronics during the trip.
 “You can work, you can read, you can sleep,” she said.
 While these amenities are attractive, Werner said he worries that Waverly residents will be reluctant to break the habit of driving their own cars and take the bus instead.
 However, the mayor thinks that there are those who will take advantage of the public transportation, including veterans going to the VA facilities in Lincoln or Omaha or college students who live in Waverly and go to school in either city.
 “I have a feeling you could see some use there,” he said.
 And special event routes may also be popular, Werner said.
 “I’m willing to give it a try,” he said.
 The feedback provided during the stakeholders and public meetings last week will be collected, along with an online survey that is still open at www.nebraskatransit.com. The survey closes March 17.

There is no vaccine for the Covid-19 coronavirus epidemic that has spread to over 50 countries in just a few months, but a group of researchers are hoping a videogame might help. _Called Foldit_, this game was developed by researchers from the University of Washington and requires players to solve complicated puzzles by folding protein chains to create new structures that have different functions.
 When it was first released in 2008, Foldit's team hoped the program might help discover a cure for HIV/AIDs or Alzheimers, since both are diseases made up mostly of proteins. But yesterday, the developers added a new puzzle based on the cellular structure of the coronavirus in hopes that players might be key to developing a cure.
 How Foldit works is complicated, but it is designed so that anyone can play. The gist is that players take protein chains and manipulate them into different shapes, which in turn defines how that protein functions. A score is given based on how effective your solution is, with a scoreboard tracking the best ideas. Foldit's _community of some 200,000 players_ don't just compete with one another but also collaborate to find the most effective designs that researchers can then experiment with in the real world to determine their efficacy.
 "Coronaviruses display a 'spike' protein on their surface, which binds tightly to a receptor protein found on the surface of human cells," explains the new coronavirus puzzle description. "Once the coronavirus spike binds to the human receptor, the virus can infect the human cell and replicate. In recent weeks, researchers have determined the structure of the 2019 coronavirus spike protein and how it binds to human receptors. If we can design a protein that binds to this coronavirus spike protein, it could be used to block the interaction with human cells and halt infection!"
 In a video about the new puzzle, one of Foldit's developers explains that this new puzzle comes in two difficulty modes. The easiest one tasks players with folding an already existing protein to come up with a new shape that will block the coronavirus' spike protein. The more challenging puzzle requires players to design that protein from scratch.
 What's cool is that the University of Washington has confirmed that the most promising designs will be tested and possibly manufactured to see if they work in the real world, although Foldit's developers caution that this process will take a long time.
 Still, Foldit and its community have done some promising work in the past. Back in 2011, Foldit users solved _a small but extremely difficult problem_ in decoding the AIDS virus that had stumped scientists for years. While there's no guarantee that Foldit will play a major role in fighting coronavirus, it's great that anyone can download the program and help.
 Foldit is a part of new branch of science called citizen science, which uses brute manpower to help solve extremely complicated problems. For example, EVE Online added a minigame that rewarded players with in-game loot for _doing basic pattern recognition puzzles_ that help map the human genome. A year later, that minigame was augmented so that players were _identifying potential exoplanets_ in other solar systems instead.
 If you want to give folding protein chains a try, Foldit is free and can _be downloaded here_.

The Oversight Board announced today that it is making available an initial $5 million from the remaining Emergency Reserves established in the Certified Budgets of FY19 and FY20 for prevention and preparedness in the face of the COVID-19 (coronavirus) risk to Puerto Rico.
 Given the fiscal responsibility put in place by the Oversight Board through budgeting policy, additional funds can and will be made available if the situation warrants incremental actions.
 The funds being made available today will enable the Task Force created by Gov. Wanda Vázquez Garced to increase public awareness and improve the public healthcare sector’s capacity. The Oversight Board will be in constant communication with the Task Force to ensure there is adequate funding for this purpose.
 The goal of making these funds available is to limit the risk to the people of Puerto Rico to the maximum extent possible by acting urgently in advance. Executive Director Natalie Jaresko announced the Board will review all expenditures made from these available funds to ensure they are used solely for epidemic preparation and response.
 The Department of Health and Oversight Board have agreed that the available funds will be used initially for the following, subject to change as the situation evolves:
 • Public education campaign including providing information, guidance documents, and technical support to local health departments, health care facilities, schools, universities, colleges, and childcare facilities across Puerto Rico.
 • Strengthening response capacity of key hospitals, including the preparation of facilities for potentially infected patients.
 • Purchase of materials for health professionals.
 • Training of nurses and paramedic staff.
 • Strategic advice for the Task Force and the Department of Health on planning for possible scenarios.

Norms are again being broken and it is all because of extreme partisanship. This battle has been going on for decades. It didn’t just start a few years ago.
 Partisanship took a hard turn in 1964 with the passage of the Civil Rights Act. The uneasy peace between Democrats and Republicans split in two. With Nixon’s racist “Southern Strategy,” white, conservative Southern Democrats starting drifting to the Republican side culminating in an almost complete takeover of the South. Both parties moved more to the left and right.
 In the early ’90s, Newt Gingrich rose to power.
 “You’re fighting a war. It is a war for power,” Gingrich told his supporters. “This party does not need another generation of cautious, prudent, careful, bland, irrelevant quasi-leaders.”

SASKATOON - A police chief in Saskatchewan wants the government to provide money to help officers deal with safety measures when the province's first supervised drug consumption site opens.
 AIDS Saskatoon, which practises harm reduction and supports people living with HIV, AIDS and hepatitis C, plans to open the site later this year.
 Saskatoon Chief Troy Cooper says the police service is already preparing and officers have reviewed drug consumption sites elsewhere in Canada.
 “We saw that when they were open, there was an immediate increase in calls such as theft and loitering, littering, trespassing, mischief," Cooper told The Canadian Press.
 Police already receive calls about robberies, drug use and drug trafficking in the neighbourhood where the site is to open, he said.
 A unit of eight officers has been added to the area "to make sure that we were visible, make sure that we could control some of that behaviour before it became an issue for the community."
 The extra officers are expected to cost the city about $800,000 annually.
 The Saskatoon Board of Police Commissioners had requested Saskatchewan's Ministry of Corrections and Policing to fund the police positions. But it was told in a letter from minister Christine Tell late last year that the province funds "areas that are of mutual provincial priority and not strictly a local concern."
 In a statement Wednesday, the ministry repeated its position.

Most of the audience praised the book, with one speaker saying it reminded her of African American ancestors who had fled slavery.

Investing in the new equipment is just the first phase in Nestlé Professional’s plans to grow coffee sales on the island. An essential part of the growth strategy is to source the beans for the machines directly from Puerto Rico. Nestlé is currently evaluating Puerto Rican coffee partners with a plan to launch the locally grown beans in the second half of 2020, with the potential of exporting them to the U.S.
 The initiative would be very important to local coffee farmers because in Sept. 2017, Hurricane Maria devastated the island’s coffee farms, destroying thousands of coffee plants and trees. The Puerto Rico Agriculture Department estimated that 85 percent of the island’s coffee harvest that year was destroyed by the powerful storm.
 “We are excited and proud to contribute to the expansion of the local coffee industry and culture, and to offer coffee lovers in Puerto Rico a quality product, this time through one of our main business partners, Wendy’s,” Miele said.
 Officials said that under the Nescafé Plan, Nestlé has distributed around 220 million high-yield, disease-resistant coffee plantlets to farmers around the world. The project helps farmers rejuvenate their plantations, multiply the yield on existing land and increase farmers’ incomes. As part of the initiative, Nestlé agronomists provide advice on farming and post-harvest practices to thousands of coffee farmers worldwide.

Sajevic said the application process isn’t difficult. He just asks that those applying clearly define how the money would go towards a goal or benefit their curriculum.
 “It’s not just frivolous stuff, it goes in line with curriculum,” he said. “It’s just a little extra that makes a big difference.”
 For applications that don’t make the cut, Sajevic said teachers can ask to have their application advertised on the foundation’s website. From there, the public can donate directly to the project. If it reaches enough funding, Sajevic said the foundation will cut a check to go towards the project.

Playing the game is an incredibly strange experience over 20 years since the original. I’m hyper aware of certain differences. The combat system works as a modern take on active-time battles, combining hack and slash combat with tactical options. Swapping characters is no different than passing a turn in a classic battle, and pausing the action to select key abilities is comfortable. Where _Final Fantasy XV_ stumbled, _Remake_ feels more confident. The former had real-time combat but much of it was automated. Hold a button to attack, hold to dodge. Swap sometimes. _Remake_ is more active. You choose when to slash, cycle through menus to pick your skills. This is an improvement. It’s the extra layer of gloss that ultimately feels odd. _Final Fantasy VII_ was rough around the edges than people might recall. The _Remake_ adds a lot more polish and extras. The boss battle with the Guard Scorpion is now a multi- stage battle with blaring missile salvos, shifting weak points, and dodge rolls. It’s exciting but loses some of the dogged charm of the original.

NEW YORK (AP) - The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared more than 1,100 points, or 4.5%, Wednesday as governments and central banks around the globe took more aggressive measures to fight the virus outbreak and its effects on the economy. The gains more than recouped the market's big losses from a day earlier as Wall Street's wild, virus-fueled swings extend into a third week. Stocks rose sharply from the get-go, led by big gains for health care stocks after Joe Biden solidified his contender status for the Democratic presidential nomination. Investors see him as a more business-friendly alternative to Bernie Sanders.

HALIFAX - Education administrators in Nova Scotia have decided to cancel all school-organized student trips to international destinations until April 30 because of the evolving situation around the novel coronavirus.
 Education Minister Zach Churchill says he fully supports the move made Wednesday by the province's regional centres for education.
 Churchill says cancelling all trips for the time being is considered a "low- risk approach," and the move was decided after the regional centres consulted with the province's chief medical officer of health.
 The minister says the idea to prohibit travel, even to areas of the world that are not currently deemed a high risk, is to minimize the overall risk of moving through international airports.
 Churchill says because the situation with the novel coronavirus is fluid, the ban will be reviewed once it expires.
 He says school principals are in the process of informing families about the decision.
 This report by The Canadian Press was first published March 4, 2020.

“We think fall 2021 is pretty doable,” she said.
 That is very soon, considering the length of time the state has been talking about public transportation between its two largest cities. Donahue said the idea has been around since the 1970s.
 “It’s exciting to be this close to it,” she said.
 The study has analyzed population, cell phone usage and travel patterns between Lincoln and Omaha and determined that over 23,000 people commute daily between the two cities. Employment data included Waverly, Ashland and Greenwood.
 Currently there is limited public transportation running in the corridor between Lincoln and Omaha, the study showed. These routes run only once or twice a day and are not designed for commuters.
 “We want to supplement their service, not duplicate,” said Donahue.
 The planners have drawn up three major routes between Omaha and Lincoln with options for use by residents of Ashland, Greenwood and Waverly.
 The proposed routes would make about 14 trips per route back and forth Monday through Friday along Interstate 80. The Red Route (Lincoln to Omaha) would have a park and ride stop at the Strategic Air Command and Aerospace Museum near Ashland. The Black Route running from Omaha to Lincoln also includes a park and ride stop at Nebraska Crossing near Gretna.
 The proposed Gold Route is a weekday line that travels on Highway 6 and makes stops in Waverly, Greenwood and Ashland. It would run three times per day, going to both Lincoln and Omaha.
 “It is designed to serve people between the two cities to allow them to get to Lincoln and Omaha,” said Fred Fravel, vice president of the transit consultant firm KFH Group in Bethesda, Md.
 Details for a fourth route that would operate for special events on the weekends are still in the works, because the bus service must meet guidelines in order to receive federal transit funding, according to Fravel.
 Funding is the next step in the process, Donahue said. The state has federal funds in reserve that will pay for a large chunk of the $5 million project. A portion of these federal monies must be spent on rural intercity bus services, which Nebraska has not done up until now, said Fravel, so they have built up some cash over the years. There are also state funds that will be used.
 “We have over half of it funded, that’s the great news,” Donahue said.
 But private funding, to the tune of about $2 million, must also be obtained. Donahue said possible partners could be large employers, universities and foundations located within the area of service.
