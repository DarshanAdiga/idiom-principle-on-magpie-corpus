Perhaps now I am going to lose your tentative sympathy, but I do not believe the allegations against Jeffrey Epstein and Ms Ghislaine Maxwell, either. And the attack on Prince Andrew is similarly unbelievable. Chapeau for Mr Trump who dared to express sympathy to Ms Maxwell. This was an act of incredible bravery, to step out of line and to say a few kind words to her and about her. The cowardly Clinton and Obama, who were close friends with Epstein and Maxwell, were mum. Trump who was not particularly close to the couple, spoke up for them. He really deserves being re-elected, despite his many faults. Such a man is a master of his own mind, and this is a very rare quality.

Weinstein’s eighty accusers collected millions; the great producer went to a life-long jail sentence. The public, the great American public was eager to lynch the man who gave them _True Romance_ and _Pulp Fiction_. Was he guilty as charged? Even the charges were a travesty of justice. Men of his generation (and of mine, too) routinely propositioned women. We are all guilty, though not many of us racked up Weinstein’s numbers. Yet every woman was free to refuse. No police reports against Weinstein appeared until the #MeToo media campaign was in full swing. Did he harass them? You and me are harassed daily by offers to take another credit card or bank loan; we are free to refuse this definitely harassing offer. Every unsolicited proposal is harassment; and we receive daily hundreds of proposals of various nature. What is so different about a sexual proposal to a woman? Weinstein may or may not have committed a crime, but in the poisonous air of #MeToo there is no need to prove any accusation, and the man was lynched.

The Hurtigruten line says the operations of three ships - MS Roald Amundsen, MS Fridtjof Nansen and MS Spitsbergen - have been halted for an indefinite period.


  The Tromsoe-based Hurtigruten was one of the first companies to resume sailing after the pandemic hit and started cruises to Norway out of Hamburg, northern Germany, in June with a single ship. It added cruises to Svalbard in July, Norwegian media reported.


  In Italy, the Costa Crociere cruise ship line said Sunday three crew members from two ships in Civitavecchia, near Rome, have tested positive for the coronavirus. The cruise company said two assigned to the Costa Deliziosa were hospitalized in good condition, and a third, assigned to the Costa Favolosa, was in isolation on the ship.


  The Italian cruise company, which is part of Carnival Corp. said the crews of both ships were being screened ''in view of the possible relaunch of our cruises, as soon as the government gives the authorization.'' The Cabinet is meeting on the matter next Sunday.


  Costa Crociere said that all crew members were tested for the virus before leaving their countries, then undergo a second test once they arrive in Italy, after which they are put under a two-week monitoring period.


  Cruise lines stopped sailing in mid-March after several high-profile coronavirus outbreaks at sea. More than 710 people fell ill aboard Carnival's Diamond Princess cruise ship while it was quarantined off Japan and 13 people died.


  A German cruise ship last week set sail from Hamburg, testing procedures for how cruise ships can operate safely during the pandemic. The ship sailed with less than 50% capacity and only went on a four-day trip at sea with no stops at other ports.

Domenic P. Iaria, of Hingham, died July 27, 2020. He is survived by his loving wife, Marguerite "Peggy" (Cronin) Iaria, his four children, Antonio Iaria and wife Rebecca, Annmarie Coyle and husband Robert, Joseph Iaria and wife Monica, Angela Iaria, three sisters Elizabeth Barbuto, Angelina Iaria, and Barbara Adams, and brother Thomas. He had 11 grandchildren, Samantha, Nicholas, Robert, Antonio, Richard, Rosie, Robert, Domenic, Joseph, Kevin and Bella and many close nieces and nephews. Domenic was born January 26, 1935, to Antonio Iaria and Giuseppina Iaria (Sorrentino) who immigrated from Calabria, Italy. Dom as he was known by everyone grew up and raised his family in Hingham. In a tight knit Italian neighborhood, his parents Antonio and Giuseppina created, they instilled in him the joy of family, friends and the benefits of a hard day's work. In 1955 he purchased a bulldozer and truck and began a lifelong career in excavation. In February 1966, he married his true love Peggy - she ran the office and Dom ran the bulldozer. In 1971 he and his brother Tom founded Iaria Bros. Inc. The company is still family run and Domenic was proud that he never retired. Three generations of Iarias - he was able to work side by side with his sons Tony and Joe as they took over day to day operations and his daughters Angie and Annmarie are running the office and also his grandsons in the field. Married to Peggy for 54 years, he was a man who believed in working hard and the rewards of a simple life. He purchased a saw mill to use in his time off, loved to garden, loved farm life; raising pigs, donkeys and the occasional bull. He kept his Italian heritage alive by making homemade wine and sausages with friends and family. He taught all his grandchildren how to chop wood and plant a vegetable garden, creating many special memories for the next generation. Always willing to laugh and if he had the time tell a great story, he was blessed with many, many friends. Dom was always someone his friends and family could depend on - ready to help at a moments notice. Dom would take the occasional vacation now and then, he and Peggy went on many cruises, visited Disney World with their kids, family, friends, and grandkids. He often went to their "The Camp in New Hampshire to relax by chopping wood and mowing his fields. He hiked down the Grand Canyon, went to Alaska twice and visited the small towns in Italy where his parents were born. Even though he loved these trips, he was never far from a tractor, excavator, his old Ford or golf cart wearing his signature engineer cap. A man a little larger than life who believed the old world way was the only way, Dom will be forever in his family's hearts. Services were private.

A British woman accused of stabbing her husband to death at their Malaysian resort home avoided the gallows and was sentenced to 42 months in jail on Monday after she pleaded guilty to a lesser charge.Lawyer Sangeet Kaur Deo said prosecutors reduced the murder charge against Samantha Jones, 51, to culpable homicide, which is murder without intent, after the defense appealed to the attorney-general's office.A conviction for murder carries a mandatory death sentence by hanging."I was scared, and he was so angry," Kaur quoted Jones as telling the court as she sought a lighter penalty before sentencing. "I miss him terribly. What I did that night was unintended. I tried to stop him, I did not know it would happen like this."In addition to the 42-month jail sentence, Kaur said Jones was also fined 10,000 ringgit ($2,368)."She is very relieved having come to terms with what happened that night and for the court ... to understand what happened that night. She didn't intend for this to happen," the lawyer told reporters later at the end of the hearing.Wearing handcuffs and a surgical mask, Jones was earlier escorted by police into the courthouse in Alor Setar in northern Kedah state for the start of the trial. She was charged nearly two years ago after police found a blood- stained kitchen knife in the couple's home where John William Jones was found dead on Oct. 18, 2018.The 63-year-old victim, who was drunk at the time, had a 15-centimeter (six-inch) wound in his liver, according to prosecutors. Police have said Jones confessed she stabbed her husband in the chest during a heated argument.The couple moved to tropical Langkawi island 11 years ago under the Malaysia My Second Home program, which gives foreigners long-stay visas.The lawyer said the couple, who had been married for 17 years, were devoted to each other but Jones was struggling with physical violence by her husband."Unfortunately Samantha found herself at the receiving end of abuse. She supported John through various therapies to address certain problems that he had, none of which worked obviously, until that unfortunate night when things took a turn for the worst," Kaur said."She has accepted the fact that she needs to serve the sentence. She acknowledged the fact that a life is lost and I think she is looking forward to her own recovery because this was indeed a traumatizing event for her," the lawyer added.Kaur said Jones, who has spent 20 months in detention, could be released as early as the end of next year with one-third off the sentence for good behavior.

Arguably, one historical inaccuracy is how much importance is put on the incident. The message in U-571 is clear: it’s the event that won the war.

Another motivation for the liquidation of Epstein's empire is the collaboration between the media and the unknown figures behind the scenes who are likely to walk away with Epstein's millions. Are you familiar with the story of Howard Hughes and the destruction of his Las Vegas empire? It happened to him. Something similar has happened in the past few years to other wealthy Jews like Donald Sterling, who was first falsely accused of being a racist and then forced to relinquish his ownership of an NBA team. Other examples? Richard Fuld of Lehmann Bros. and Bernie Madoff were taken down by their Wall Street rivals and then used as scapegoats to expiate the sins of corporate raiders. Harvey Weinstein was the sacrificial schwein to absolve the sick Hollywood culture. Now that Weinstein has been destroyed, Hollywood can go back to business as usual.

Two days after a crash brought a premature end to his return to competition at Strade Bianche, Vincenzo Nibali (Trek-Segafredo) was back in the saddle on Monday for the Gran Trittico Lombardo after it was confirmed that he had sustained no fractures in the fall.


  Nibali injured his left hand in a crash with 70km remaining at Strade Bianche, and he abandoned the race shortly afterwards. After training for an hour and a half on Sunday morning, Nibali later had his injury assessed at Juventus football club's J-Medical centre at the Allianz Stadium in Turin, where he was given the all-clear to compete at the Gran Trittico Lombardo.


  "Unfortunately, they're things that can happen in a race but in the end it all went well," Nibali told reporters at the start of the Gran Trittico Lombardo in Legnano.


  The Gran Trittico Lombardo is a new addition to the revised UCI calendar and, for this year only, it replaces the Tre Valli Varesine, Coppa Bernocchi and Coppa Agostoni on a schedule redrawn due to the COVID-19 pandemic.


  The race combines elements of all three of the Trittico Lombardo's constituent events and finishes on the same Varese circuit that traditionally features in the finale of the Tre Valli Varesine.


  In 2015, Nibali came close to achieving a hat-trick in the events, losing out to Davide Rebellin in a sprint at the Coppa Agostoni, before winning the Coppa Bernocchi and Tre Valli Varesine. Nibali lines up on Monday in a Trek- Segafredo team that also includes Giulio Ciccone and Gianluca Brambilla.


  "Today we'll see how it goes. We can do a nice race, and we'll see how my condition is during the race," Nibali said. "I'm a bit unsure. Strade Bianche was a hard race, but today it's a different kind of race and the route has changed too."


  The Sicilian is also scheduled to ride Milano-Torino and Milan-San Remo in the coming days before lining out at Gran Piemonte and Il Lombardia next week. The World Championships in Martigny and October's rescheduled Giro d'Italia are Nibali's primary targets on the rearranged calendar.


  Speaking to _La Gazzetta dello Sport_, Nibali's coach Paolo Slongo described the crash that ended his challenge at Strade Bianche.


  "It was on the seventh sector of dirt road. Vincenzo was just before the last uphill part and he took a hand off the bars to drink," Slongo said. "He lost his balance on a bend and then somebody landed on top of him."

The logos of local charity foundations were beamed into the Merseyside sky as the club paid tribute to those whose selfless work continues to provide great comfort to a community in distress.


  Emblazoned onto the Anfield turf were the logos of the LFC Foundation, Fans Supporting Foodbanks and the Owen McVeigh Foundation, an organisation that was established in 2015.


  The Foundation was created by Mark McVeigh in memory of his son, 11-year-old Owen, who tragically passed away in December 2015, shortly after being diagnosed with leukaemia.


  A special flag was created in Owen’s memory following his passing, one that was adapted by the Spion Kop 1906 group from an original pencil image drawn by the Liverpool fan's aunt, Natalie.


  Its poignant silhouetted image of a dad and lad, hand in hand, carried the simple message of “It’s off to the match we go”. It was later turned into a t-shirt and worn by several of Klopp's top stars.


  That was the picture that spread across the pitch as Liverpool cherished their 19th league crown less than two weeks ago.


  The Owen McVeigh Foundation have worked closely with Liverpool FC since its inception, but seeing the company's name in lights was a shock to even Mark himself as he watched the historic night unfold from home with his wife, Joanne.


  "The stuff with the lights, we didn't know anything about it," he tells the ECHO. "We didn't have a clue. The first thing I knew of it was when I saw it. And then the phone went off its head.


  "I got asked for a high definition version of our emblem earlier in the week off the club and I didn't think anything unusual of it as we are working with them a lot lately.


  "So I didn't even ask why they wanted it. I just sent them a few depending on what they needed it for.


  "And then we saw it on Wednesday night. Me and the missus had made the decision not to go out.


  "We just stayed in. When something like that is going to happen we just book the next day off work because things can get a bit heavy after nights like that.
