The family of William (Willy) Varga sadly announces his passing on Friday, June 12, 2020 at the Port Colborne Hospital in his 71st year. He is predeceased by his parents, Bill and Marie Varga and brother-in-law Bill McGowan. He is survived by his sister Ilona McGowan (Michael), his nephews Michael, Sean, and Tim (late Tracy), his nieces Lynn (Carm) and Ann (Shawn), his great nephews Travis, Tanner (Nikki), Dallas, Joshua, great nieces Tasha, Corie, Tiana, and grand-nephew Houston. He will also be sadly missed by his loving companion and best friend Betty Ruicci, and family, Michele Ruicci (Uli Quinones) and Lili and Ari (the "Knuckleheads"), Ryan Ruicci (Sherry Roberts), Jaden, Tristan, and Ethan Ruicci (the "Chuckleheads") and Joe Ruicci. Also, many, many friends and his loyal golf buddies from "Plan B". Willy will be remembered as a happy-go-lucky guy, and anyone who knew him knows that he loved and melted hearts with his kindness and complete loyalty. If anyone needed help, he was always right there doing as much as he could for anyone. Words will never sum up this wonderful, considerate, and caring man. In keeping with his wishes, cremation has taken place with arrangements entrusted to the ARMSTRONG FUNERAL HOME & CHAPEL, 179 Clarence Street, Port Colborne. There is a private family funeral service planned, with a Celebration of Life to be announced at a later date. We would like to sincerely thank all of his friends and loved ones for all of the support and joy that you provided to Willy over the last few months with talks and texts to him. I can't thank you all enough for all that you did to help keep him cheerful at this difficult time in his life. Thank you also to Dr. VanderMeer, Dr. Ishkanian, and all the doctors and caring staff at the Walker Family Cancer Centre, and Dr. Scher and the wonderful nursing staff at the 2 South Wing of the Port Colborne Hospital. We could not have asked for better care than what was provided to Willy from these compassionate nurses and doctors. If so desired, memorial donations may be made to the Walker Cancer Foundation or in honor of Willy's love for dogs and cats, to the Port Colborne or Welland Humane Society. "A great soul never dies but lives forever in the hearts of those they loved" Online condolences available at www.armstrongfuneralhome.ca

Netanyahu has for decades socialized with the ultra-wealthy and his supporters say he has given up opportunities to amass great wealth to serve the country instead. But he and his wife have gained a reputation for enjoying the good life, repeatedly landing in hot water for misusing state funds.

Let me confess right up front: I've been spoiled.
   
 Every morning for more than 80 years now, the day has dawned, the sun has risen. Some mornings were a bit darker than others, to be sure, but light always has come. Every single day, without exception.
   
 Do the math to figure out how many minutes have ticked on the clock during all those years, and the resulting totals may amaze you. During all those minutes my heart has pumped and my lungs have inflated. They just keep doing it. Without fail. And most of the time I've just taken it for granted. I'm spoiled.
   
 All of the days in all of those years I have been surrounded by loving family members and by a host of friends. And at least partly because of those dear people, I've always had food for my belly, clothes on my back, and a roof over my head. Always. I can't imagine having to sleep on a sidewalk or in a homeless camp. I don't live in that world. I've been spoiled.
   
 How often do you pause to say "Thank You" to the good Lord who keeps the earth spinning and the seasons rotating and the seeds germinating to provide us a lush, dependable ecosphere to exist in?
   
 When you go through the daily routines of putting on your socks or picking up your glasses or taking your meds, do you ever stop to realize how many inhabitants of this planet can't do that? Does it ever occur to you just how spoiled we are? And it's all because of the goodness of our God. Our heavenly Father loves to spoil us.
   
 When the apostle Paul wanted to identify his God to the pagans in Lystra, he pointed out blessings like these I've just mentioned. "He has shown kindness by giving you rain from heaven and crops in their seasons," he told them. "He provides you with plenty of food and fills your hearts with joy."
   
 Most of us can testify along with the inhabitants of ancient Jerusalem, "We have had enough to eat and plenty to spare, because the Lord has blessed his people." In fact, some of us can confess that we've had more than enough to eat. We've been spoiled.
   
 Far more vital to us than God's physical blessings, of course, are the spiritual ones. Paul expressed his gratitude for "God's abundant provision of grace and of the gift of righteousness" that we receive through Jesus.
   
 "The Lord is good to all," the psalmist sang. "He has compassion on all he has made."
   
 How blessed we are that he spoils us.
