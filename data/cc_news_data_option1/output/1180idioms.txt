Technical chart claims that Two Harbors Investment Corp. (TWO) would settle between $5.29/share to $6.25/share level. However, if the stock price goes below the $3.77 mark, then the market for Two Harbors Investment Corp. becomes much weaker. If that happens, the stock price might even plunge as low as $3.21 for its downside target. The stock is currently in the red zone of MACD, with the indicator reading -2.24. Traders are always alerted for the move of a stock above or below the zero line due to the fact that the reading is an indicator of the position of the short-term average relative to the long-term average. If the MACD is above the zero line, then the short-term average relative is above that of the long-term average, thus implying an upward momentum. Vice versa is the case if the MACD is below the zero line.

Frederick made the decision to discontinue Tutto Bene’s lunch hours – instead, giving sole focus to its dinner service – but the restaurant’s menu remained mostly the same. However, he knew some of the dishes wouldn’t travel well in to-go boxes, so he substituted them for more “bulletproof” items.
 These dishes would ensure that once a customer got home and put their meal on a plate – or just ate it out of the box – they would be getting the same food representation that they would get if they were dining in the restaurant.

“I think we just became more consistent, and that was due to understanding roles and getting the rotation, and growing in leadership,” Nore said in discussing the team’s evolution throughout the season.
 Nore highlighted the 74-66 win over Fort Lewis win in Spearfish because, he said, it showcased what the team could do. He added the win over UC-Colorado Springs game showcased how the team was able to score.
 Grit and fighting spirit highlighted the Western State win for Nore. Black Hills State claimed a 12-3 scoring edge in the fourth quarter to prevail.
 “The game that kind of solidified it was the regular-season game at Colorado School of Mines,” he said. “We really executed as well as we have all year.” Black Hills State won that game 55-48.
 Wientjes earned a Defensive Player of the Week award from the conference. Nore said she showed a lot of grit and really grew as a player. Wientjes collected 14 and 11 rebounds in two separate games.
 Nore said Switzer grew into a leadership role, with Ashlee Beacom developing into a really solid player. Niki Van Wyk and Ham also earned Nore’s praise.
 Switzer was the lone senior on the active roster. “She had to come out of her shell a lot,” Nore said.
 “From the time Abby (Switzer) was a freshman to the time she was a senior: I think that was a highlight, too, for me,” Nore said. He explained the senior provided a lot of impact on and off the court in many ways.
 Nore said the players must continue to grow. He added leadership will provide a defining area, with players and coaches holding players accountable.
 “That will solve a lot of issues,” he said.

The unprecedented and unpredictable spread of the outbreak has seen the situation in the rest of the world deteriorating.

 In the present circumstances and based on the information provided by the WHO today, the IOC President and the Prime Minister of Japan have concluded that the Games of the XXXII Olympiad in Tokyo must be rescheduled to a date beyond 2020 but not later than summer 2021, to safeguard the health of the athletes, everybody involved in the Olympic Games and the international community.
 The leaders agreed that the Olympic Games in Tokyo could stand as a beacon of hope to the world during these troubled times and that the Olympic flame could become the light at the end of the tunnel in which the world finds itself at present. Therefore, it was agreed that the Olympic flame will stay in Japan. It was also agreed that the Games will keep the name Olympic and Paralympic Games Tokyo 2020.

 During the coronavirus pandemic, the BBC has been told by immigration lawyers that the Home Office has continued to arrest people and place them in IRCs, including in the last few days.
 However, the lawyers have told the BBC there is an inability to remove people to their countries of origin because of a lack of deportation flights.
 Toufique Hossain of Duncan Lewis solicitors says "it is now abundantly clear the Secretary of State has no lawful basis to detain simply because removals can no longer take place."
 ## 'Danger to public health'
 Mr Hossain says a client of his legal firm who is living with HIV was detained as recently as last week.
 Another detainee has told the BBC he was arrested in early March with a cough and a fever, but was still transferred to Morton Hall IRC in Lincolnshire.
 He was asked by a nurse - who was wearing no personal protective equipment - why he had been sent there given that he was displaying symptoms. He has since tested negative and been released.
 Bella Sankey, from the Detention Action campaign group which is taking the legal action in the High Court, says IRCs need to be closed immediately.
 "These are not closed centres, they're not like cruise ships, staff go in and out of detention centres as visitors, and indeed the majority of people detained in our immigration estate will eventually be released back into the community," she said.
 "It's not only inhumane to carry on detaining people in these circumstances, but it's actually a danger to public health nationally."
 The BBC understands that around 900 detainees were in the UK's immigration removal centres last Friday, after the release of 300 people last week.
 Later on Wednesday, in the High Court, Detention Action is taking legal action against the Home Office.
 A government statement said: "Decisions to detain are made on a case-by-case basis and kept under constant review, but our priority is to maintain the lawful detention of the most high-harm individuals, including foreign national offenders."
