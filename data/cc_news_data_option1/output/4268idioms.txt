O’Neill has opened the door for young players this season, also including Josh Tymon, Tyrese Campbell, Tashan Oakley-Boothe and Jacob Brown.
 But Smith can see the importance of permanent summer signings Mikel, James Chester and Steven Fletcher.
 “You want experienced players in the right positions,” he said.
 “I’ve always tried to get a wise centre-half and midfielder, the ones who are controlling the pace of the game. That’s where it starts. They will pull the other players around them. You need your Mikels about, they will talk to the younger players.”
 Stoke are 10th after the opening half-a-dozen matches heading into the weekend's home match against promotion favourites Brentford.
 “I think I’m more optimistic than most at the moment,” said Smith.
 “Everybody can be doom and gloom but generally we’ve looked ok. We’re still a work in progress and I think Michael will say that. He’s still finding his best team but while we’re doing that we’re not looking like we’re going to be turned over.
 “A lot of people will disagree. A lot of people can be a manager on social media, it’s a doddle of a job.

“We’ve looked solid and what I’m delighted with is the two centre-backs coming in and playing so well, usually with an experienced defender alongside them, which helps.
 “Mikel was outstanding in front of them as well against Barnsley. It’s how quickly he sees the pass, how quickly he moves the ball. I’m always just going, ‘Well done’ when he’s on the screen. It might be things a lot of people don’t see. You see people doing step-overs and drag backs up the field. You don’t see the person playing in the holding role who played the first pass or won the ball.
 “Both Souttar and Collins, for such big lads, are very comfortable on the ball. Collins’s dad (David) played for me at Oxford. He was very laid back and comfortable and Nathan seems the same.
 “The test will be to see how they are able to do it after 10 or 15 games. It takes mental concentration to keep defending, keep defending and always doing your job. It’s not easy.
 “But if they want to be top players they’ve got to do it – and they are certainly capable of going a long way. They’ve got pace as well.”

It is the first publicly funded electric, autonomous shuttle in Virginia, officials said. Similar pilot projects are up and running in different places across the country, but what makes the Relay shuttle somewhat unique is the environment in which it will operate. While some projects are limited to college campuses or operate in dedicated lanes, this shuttle will mix with real traffic in a particularly busy section of Fairfax County.

“I had a major sleepover at my apartment, but I will say I regret not planning a big one,” Jennifer shared. She then went on to explain why she didn't plan a big event. “My friend was getting married close to me and I went to her Bachelorette and then we ended up—typical Leo—we called it my Bachelorette,” Jennifer revealed. Even though it wasn’t big and over the top, Jennifer still had a blast at her Bachelorette party. “It was the most fun weekend of my entire life,” Jennifer shared. “I don’t know how she felt, but I had a blast.”

Oklahoma State has a legitimate shot at a College Football Playoff berth, but the Cowboys might be knocked out of the picture with a loss. Iowa State has improved significantly under fifth-year coach Matt Campbell, but the Cyclones haven’t reached a Big 12 championship game. Iowa State would greatly improve its chances of reaching the title game with a victory.
 KEY MATCHUP
 Iowa State QB Brock Purdy vs. Oklahoma State pass rush. Purdy is mobile and throws well on the run. The Cowboys will have to pressure him, then contain him and make plays when the opportunity is presented. He hasn’t had a breakout game this season, but this is an ideal stage for a guy building his resume for NFL scouts.

Procedural distinctions like this are important to understand when it comes to Murkowski. At this point, Mitch McConnell might be satisfied is she and Susan Collins just sat out the vote. With Mitt Romney on board — early and often, as it turns out — McConnell has 51 votes. All 47 Democrats (or as many as show up) can be expected to vote against, including Joe Manchin and Doug Jones. A 51-47 party-line vote will look a _wee_ bit better than a 51-49 result with “bipartisan” opposition.

Federal prosecutors said Snyder allegedly solicited money from co-defendant John Cortina, of Kustom Auto Body in Portage, and “Individual A” and gave them a towing contract for Portage.
 Cortina, 81, in January 2019 pleaded guilty to a charge that he paid bribes to Snyder to get a spot on the tow list. Cortina did not testify during the trial.
 Cortina was sentenced Jan. 22 to time served and a $12,000 fine.

Point of order for Newsweek: “Unanimous consent” has a specific parliamentary meaning. The Judiciary Committee moved Barrett’s nomination not on unanimous consent but on a roll-call vote this morning. Unanimous consent is a passive way to move bills and procedural votes. The video of this morning’s proceedings shows the clerk calling the roll and getting a 12-0 result, which means this was much more intentional than “unanimous consent.”

“Our project will help organizations that serve young children and their families who may have experienced trauma to be more trauma-informed," Evans said. "By embracing the core principals of a trauma-informed approach to care the project will help transform how people experience services."
 Working with The Institute on Trauma and Trauma-Informed Care (ITTIC), Allegany County will be the home to a Trauma-Informed Care Champions Program. Later this fall, 30 individuals will apply to become a TIC Champion and participate in a year-long educational program.
 Participants will learn about the core principals of trauma-informed care, including encouraging safety, trustworthiness and transparency, peer support, collaboration, empowerment, and humility and responsiveness.
 For more information on the Allegany County Trauma-Informed Care Champions Program, or to join the Trauma-Informed Communities throughout Allegany County Coalition, contact Evans at (585) 593-5223 ext. 1011.

Without discriminating between sides of the ball, the lackluster game against Atlanta stunned coach Mike Zimmer one week after a crushing one-point defeat at unbeaten Seattle.
 “If you lose a game, you shouldn’t have a letdown. You should put a foot on the grinder and get back to work,” Zimmer said.
 Now the Vikings, in their bye week, have been handed extra time to be confronted with their shortcomings.
 “It will give us a chance to kind of refresh to try to figure out individually, ‘What can I do better going into the next part of the season?’” wide receiver Adam Thielen said. “You really have to take advantage of this time with how we started. If we want to be a tough team and come back and get on a roll, we are going to have to all kind of self-evaluate.”

Cousins, in a sobering self-reflection after the game, didn’t get it, either.
 “I simply forced the football into coverage, tried to do too much. That’s a mistake I may have made in Year 1, but I’m disappointed that I would do that now,” said Cousins, who was picked off only six times in 2019 and now has a league-high 10 interceptions just six games into 2020.
 The second turnover was a bit less egregious, but Cousins was still outfoxed by a rookie when cornerback A.J. Terrell left his man and jumped in front of a hitch route by Jefferson and made a juggling interception.
 The third one wasn’t his fault, forced when simultaneous contact by a pass rusher with his arm and the ball produced a wobbler that wound up in the arms of Foye Oluokon. Still, the damage done by the first three-interception first half of Cousins’ career was too much to overcome for a Vikings team trying to renovate a once-dominant defense on the fly.
