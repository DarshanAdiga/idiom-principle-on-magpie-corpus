The first home game for Norwood is Oct. 16 and the boys play Mancos that night. Homecoming and whether that will happen is still up in the air. Dinsmore said he knows the high school kids on student council are discussing it.
 The date for homecoming was moved when football got switched to a spring sport due to the pandemic. With football back on for fall now, it’s made the planning of homecoming a challenge, especially because of the dance.
 Dinsmore agreed the guys are ready to play football. He said the fall option was better for Norwood in general, since the field in March is usually snowy and nobody can be sure what will happen in the spring with regard to the pandemic. According to Dinsmore, something like 80 percent of teams made the same choice to move football back to fall.
 Coach Hickey said he is happy to get started.
 “We are thrilled to be back on the field,” he said. “The kids are ready to get back to normal life.’

The head of the Federal Aviation Administration, a former military and airline pilot, said Wednesday that he liked what he saw during a two-hour test flight of Boeing’s revamped 737 Max jetliner, a key step as the agency considers whether to let the plane return to flight after two deadly crashes.
 Administrator Stephen Dickson said the FAA is “in the home stretch” of its review of the plane, but he vowed not to take short cuts and declined to set a deadline for a decision.
 The FAA said Dickson sat in the captain’s seat during the flight, which took off from the former Boeing Field near Seattle with Boeing pilots also on board.
 The crew put the jet through repeated changes in direction, speed and altitude as it headed east over the Cascade Range into central Washington state, according to data from tracking site Flightradar24.com. Dickson said he landed the plane twice and also did "some air work maneuvers."
 The Max has been grounded since March 2019, after the second crash. Both times, an automated anti-stall system pushed the nose of the plane down based on faulty readings from sensors. Boeing hopes to win FAA approval later this year for changes it has made to flight-control software and computers, including tamping down the anti-stall system’s power and adding redundancies.
 “I liked what I saw on the flight this morning, but we are not to the point yet where we have completed the process” of certifying Boeing’s changes, said Dickson, who had vowed to fly the plane himself before the FAA cleared it to carry passengers again.
 Zipporah Kuria, a British citizen whose father died in the second Max crash, called Dickson’s flight “a gimmick” to reassure the public.
 “Just because Dickson flies in a 737 Max 8 doesn’t make it safe,” she said. “It’s clearly a PR stunt for the FAA and a free endorsement for Boeing.”
 Michael Stumo, of Massachusetts, whose daughter died in the second crash, criticized the FAA for not publicly disclosing technical descriptions and test data it is using to judge the plane. Dickson said the FAA is working closely with other global regulators and being transparent in its review of the plane.
 Shortly before Dickson’s flight, the House Transportation Committee approved legislation to change the way the FAA certifies new planes, including the agency’s reliance on employees of Boeing and other aircraft makers to perform key safety analysis.
 The bill would not eliminate the FAA’s use of private-sector employees to review their own companies’ planes — lawmakers believe it would be too expensive for FAA to do the work, and that the aerospace companies have more technical expertise. Instead, the bill would give FAA approval over picking private-sector employees who perform safety analysis and allow civil penalties for companies that interfere with their work. Boeing whistleblowers complained of pressure to approve systems on the Max.
 The bill would also require plane manufacturers to tell the FAA, airlines and pilots about automated systems that can alter a plane’s path. Top FAA officials and most pilots did not know about the anti-stall system on the Max, called MCAS, until after the first crash, in October 2018 in Indonesia. Less than five months later, another Max crashed in Ethiopia. In all, 346 people died.
 “Those crashes were the inevitable culmination of stunning acts of omissions within Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration,” said committee Chairman Peter DeFazio, D-Ore.
 Rep. Garret Graves, R-La., a staunch defender of the FAA, said the agency represents “the gold standard” in aviation regulation but the crashes show the need for improvement.
 The committee approved the bill by what appeared to be a unanimous voice vote. Rep. Paul Mitchell, R-Mich., left the meeting after complaining that lawmakers had only one day to read the bill, which he called an “absurd” rush for such a complex, technical subject.
 The measure, based on recommendations from U.S. and international regulators and safety investigators, goes next to the full House. Its fate is uncertain, however. A similar bill was pulled from consideration in a Senate committee on Sept. 16, and Congress is rushing to adjourn so that lawmakers can go home and campaign for reelection.

BRIMFIELD -- Benjamin Bedell was a fun-loving guy who always made his classmates laugh, a former teacher said.
   
 "He had a real dry sense of humor. He was fun to call on for answers to things. He would say something silly, and then he would come up with the answer," said Scott Carlson, the social studies teacher and basketball coach at Brimfield High School. "He was just a kid that all the other classmates enjoyed having in class because they knew he would crack up the class once or twice during the time he was there. I think he enjoyed being at school because he had his friends around him and he knew he could get a laugh or two."
   
 Bedell, 18, a 2020 graduate of Brimfield High School, was pronounced dead about 4 p.m. Tuesday at the scene of the wreck at Illinois Route 89 and County Road 2100 North, a few miles south of Washburn.
   
 The accident happened about 3 p.m. Tuesday when Bedell was driving east on the county road and pulled into the Route 89 intersection. He was struck by a northbound semitrailer truck hauling grain. The truck driver, Glenn Edwards, 70, of Henderson, Tenn., was taken by LifeFlight to OSF HealthCare Saint Francis Medical Center in Peoria.
   
 In addition to having a great sense of humor, Bedell was also a fine chess player, said Robert Bernales, the Brimfield High School math teacher and chess coach.
   
 "He was an awesome chess player, probably the heart and soul of the team," said Bernales. "He was well-respected."
   
 Bedell joined the chess team as a novice player, but he soon became an expert.
   
 "He was a quick learner. He picked up the game and strategies very fast," said Bernales. "He actually beat me in a few games -- he pulled some surprises on me in a few games."
   
 Bernales recalled a match against Metamora that appeared all but lost.
   
 "He was losing pretty badly, and his opponent wasn't being very careful, and Ben found the one winning move -- it was perfect," said Bernales. "I remember the player from Metamora got mad and stormed out, but they became friends later. It was a pretty awesome game."
   
 Wednesday was a rough day for teachers and students at Brimfield High School. With a student body of only about 240, everyone pretty much knows everybody. Bernales was among the many who took a day off to deal with their grief.
   
 "We had quite a few not here, actually, and it was pretty somber," said Carlson. "It wasn't that long ago that we lost another student, Aaron Miller. A lot of their friends are the same people. Brimfield has been hit really hard for everybody to take. Especially their families and friends are definitely hurting."
   
 Miller, 16, had just finished the first day of his junior year at Brimfield High School on Aug. 19 when he died in a single-vehicle wreck on U.S. Route 150 in Peoria County.
   
 "Everybody around here is shocked and very sad," said Carlson. "It's going to take awhile to get past it, I'm sure. We are praying for their families and friends."

The conference commissioners who manage the College Football Playoff decided to stick with a four-team format during this pandemic-altered season after the Pac-12 made a request to consider expansion.
 College Football Playoff executive director Bill Hancock said Wednesday that Pac-12 commissioner Larry Scott asked the rest of management committee to consider having eight teams play for the national championship this season. ESPN first reported Scott broaching the subject.
 The request was made because of disruptions to the season caused by the pandemic. Conferences are not playing the same number of games, are starting play at different times and there are no interconference matchups between Power Five leagues.
 Hancock said the committee, with 10 FBS commissioners and Notre Dame athletic director Jack Swarbrick, had a “civil and thoughtful discussion.”
 “To do it now, it’s such a significant change with so many challenges, especially with the season started, they thought it was best to not make a change,” Hancock said.
 Hancock added any decision on expansion would need the approval of the CFP’s presidential oversight committee after a recommendation by commissioners.
 The playoff semifinals are scheduled for Jan. 1 at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif., and Sugar Bowl in New Orleans. The national championship game is set for Jan. 11 at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Fla.
 Scott declined a request for comment through a Pac-12 spokesman.
 Also, the Pac-12 announced a partnership with Fulgent Genetics that will supplement its testing capabilities it already has with a deal reached earlier this summer with Quidel Corporation.
 Big 12 commissioner Bob Bowlsby said he was happy to have the discussion, but it was apparent there was not enough support among the group to continue talking about what he called “a Herculean task.”
 “There probably could be multiple motivations. Some probably just like their position and were happy to have it play itself out as originally planned. Others probably saw it as perhaps an opportunity for more slots that weren’t available previously,” Bowlsby said. “Those kinds of things we were never going to do without something close to unanimity. It was obvious from the discussion we weren’t going to get close to that.”
 The Pac-12 postponed its fall football season Aug. 11, but changed course last week and decided to have a seven-game season starting Nov. 7.
 “(Scott) should have asked for it in their circumstance because they’re going to have fewer games than most everybody else,” Bowlsby said.
 The Big Ten also decided to conduct a fall season after initially postponing and have set plans to have its teams play as many as nine games, starting Oct. 24.
 The Mid-American Athletic Conference (six games) and Mountain West (eight games) also are starting late.
 The Southeastern Conference, Atlantic Coast Conference and Big 12 already are up and running among the Power Five leagues. The SEC is planning to play a 10-game regular season, all in conference. The Big 12 has a 10-game regular season schedule, with one home nonconference game for each team. ACC teams have an 11-game, regular-season schedule with one home nonconference game.
 Outside the Power Five, the American Athletic Conference, Sun Belt and Conference USA have permitted their schools to play up to 12 total games.
 Outside the Power Five, the American Athletic Conference, Sun Belt and Conference USA have permitted their schools to play up to 12 total games.
 AAC commissioner Mike Aresco is the one member of the management committee who has publicly suggested playoff expansion in the past. He said he was supported having the conversation, but doing it now just wasn’t feasible.
 “The logistical problems are pretty significant,” he said.
 With new testing partnership, Fulgent will serve as a supplemental resource for each Pac-12 school. The RT-PCR testing program from Fulgent will be driven by their new COVID-19 screening platform, which provides an end-to-end solution for routine and repeat testing, including onsite testing for student- athletes and staff, 24-hour results and mobile delivery and interface.
 “We are excited to be partnering with a leading testing company in Fulgent to provide our athletic departments with the very best capabilities to protect the health and well-being of our student-athletes,” Scott said in a statement.

That’s only true in the northern hemisphere — in the southern hemisphere you must drive clockwise. Consequently, roundabouts are not permitted along the equator (that’s why many people are moving to Pekanbaru).


  2\. What’s up with flashing yellow arrows?


  Flashing yellow arrows (FYA’s) allow vehicles waiting within the intersection to turn left when the signal turns red and before conflicting traffic receives a green light. Thus, avoiding the “Yellow Trap Dilemma” (the movie is better than the book). Unfortunately, not all intersections are candidates for FYA’s (more on this in a future column).


  3\. Why do some roundabouts have two circulating lanes even though the adjacent roadway has only one receiving lane?

AMMAN — Jordan and China have stood “shoulder to shoulder and helped each other through thick and thin” in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, Beijing’s envoy to Amman Pan Weifang said on Wednesday.
 In his address on the occasion of the 71st anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China, the ambassador said: “Under the leadership of His Majesty King Abdullah, the Jordanian government and people have shown great sympathy and support to the Chinese people in their great fight against COVID-19.”
 Relevant Chinese government departments, local governments and enterprises have provided a large number of epidemic prevention materials to Jordan in batches, the envoy said in his address, a copy of which was made available to The Jordan Times.
 Companies with Chinese investment such as Arab Potash Corp. and Atalat Oil Shale Power Station Project have generously donated to the Ministry of Health and Jordan’s National Aid Fund. Meanwhile, Jack Ma, founder of China’s Alibaba Group, promptly provided Jordan with a large number of testing kits, ventilators, infrared thermometers, medical masks, protective suits and other epidemic prevention materials, for which His Majesty King Abdullah awarded Ma with the King Abdullah II Ibn Al Hussein Order for Distinction of the First Degree.
 Touching on bilateral trade, the envoy said that China has become Jordan’s third largest trading partner and second largest source of imports.
 “The sudden outbreak of the epidemic has affected China-Jordan cooperation to some extent, but it is bound to be only temporary,” Weifang said.
 In 2019, the bilateral trade totalled $4.112 billion, up 29.17 per cent year- on-year, he said.
 “To these, our two countries should be full of confidence, work closely together, give full play to our traditional strengths of friendship and economic complementarities, and jointly meet challenges and seek common development,” he noted.
 On July 6, the 9th Ministerial Meeting of the China-Arab States Cooperation Forum was co-chaired by China and Jordan, and State Councillor and Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Yi put forward five suggestions at the meeting, namely, strengthening solidarity and cooperation, hand in hand to overcome COVID-19, firmly supporting each other, safeguarding fairness and justice, adhering to multilateralism, improving global governance, building One Belt One Road initiative joining hands for rejuvenation, promoting political dialogue, and bettering the Middle East security, which have won positive response from Arab countries, including Jordan, the envoy recalled.
 “The Amman Declaration, the Forum’s Action Plan for 2020-2022 and the Joint Statement on Solidarity between China and Arab Countries in the Fight against COVID-19” have “opened up new prospects” for China and Jordan to accelerate the joint development of the One Belt One Road initiative and realise common sustainable development within the overall cooperation framework.
 “It is believed that with the joint efforts of both sides, China-Jordan relations will continue to brave the wind and waves, sail far, and bring more benefits to our peoples,” the ambassador said.
 Elaborating on the fight against the pandemic, Weifang said China will continue to advance international cooperation on epidemic prevention and control and promote the building of a human health community.
 “Now China is one of the countries in the world which has best stemmed the pandemic,” he said.
 Confronting the special year of “Big Test”, Chinese government promptly made a major decision to coordinate epidemic prevention and control with economic and social development, the ambassador said.
 “The whole country rallied as one and overcame the difficulties, and the economy successfully resumed after a short period of dormancy. China’s economy grew by 3.2% year on year in the second quarter,” he added.
 The envoy also extended the embassy’s festive greetings to Overseas Chinese in Jordan and expressed “our heartfelt thanks to Jordanian friends from all walks of life who have long cared about the development of China-Jordan friendly relations.”
 “I arrived in Jordan in December 2015 and have been working in Jordan for nearly five years. I am deeply impressed by the warmth and friendship of the Jordanian people and the rapid development of bilateral relations in various fields,” he said.

When the downturn in the S&P 500 reversed in late March, several strategists struggled to predict how far and long the rally could go, the review shows.


  In a June email to Reuters, Subramanian defended her team’s record and highlighted the unprecedented nature of the crisis. “It is precisely during moments of uncertainty that we should strive to provide investors with our best guess as well as a range of scenarios around that framework,” she wrote.


  She did not respond to requests for further comment last week.


  Bank of America declined to comment for this article. Of the other five largest banks, JPMorgan Chase & Co , Citigroup Inc , Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo & Co also declined.


  Goldman Sachs Group Inc , in a response to Reuters in May, said its forecasts are made with the best information it has available at the time and that it noted in research early in the year that a significant change in circumstances relating to coronavirus would alter its forecasts. In response to additional questions from Reuters in late September, the bank declined further comment.


  “THEY MISSED IT”


  The market’s rebound this year comes as the economy and public health continue to feel the devastating effects of the pandemic. The resulting disconnect between Wall Street and Main Street has investors trying to understand market behavior.


  Wall Street research has long been a staple input in investment theses for all stripes of investors, but some say they are relying less on it now.


  Rob Christian, co-head of research and investment management at Franklin Templeton’s hedge fund solutions group K2 Advisors, said while he pays attention to sell-side research, his group is putting “less weight on it as there are so many unknowns.”


  "In general, they missed it as a group,” Christian said, referring to the pandemic. “We think it is really hard to predict anything now.”


  Some of the strategists’ predictions have proved to be correct. JPMorgan’s chief U.S. equity strategist Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, for example, did not cut his initial year-end S&P 500 target of 3,400 during the crash, arguing that the selloff was temporary and policy response would outlast the impact of COVID-19. The target was raised to 3,600 on September 11.


  But he also argued in a Feb. 27 research note that the pandemic would have “one-time earnings hits for companies.” Between then and Sept. 11, he reduced his 2020 S&P 500 earnings per share estimate to US$136 from US$174.


  Lakos-Bujas did not respond to requests for comment.


  NOT BULLISH ENOUGH


  Morgan Stanley chief U.S. equity strategist Michael Wilson and his colleagues cut their year-end S&P 500 forecast the day the market hit its low on March 23. “The speed and intensity of this recession is worse than we expected,” they wrote at the time. But they also said they were “incrementally more bullish,” and by mid-April were raising their year-end S&P 500 target back up again.


  It was not bullish enough, however. Early in September, Wilson wrote that investors were surprised by the “persistence and magnitude” of the rally over the past few months. "While we were early to call for a new bull market back in late March, we have to admit we did not expect the S&P 500 to make its way to 3,600 by Labor Day," they wrote in a Sept. 8 note. "We doubt many others did either."


  At Goldman Sachs, strategists led by David Kostin cut their S&P 500 2020 earnings per share target three times in 30 days and price target twice during the market downdraft of late February and March. When the market started to rally, they held fire even as the S&P 500 surpassed their year-end target of 3,000, and finally raised it to 3,600 in August.


  “The building blocks of that price have shifted dramatically during the past six months,” they wrote on Aug. 14.


  Wilson and Kostin did not respond to requests for comment.


  "A WILD GUESS"


  Indeed, economic whiplash from the coronavirus and unprecedented government intervention have made the traditional predictive tools unreliable, analysts and investors said.


  Earnings per share estimates, a key input in S&P 500 price forecasts, initially lagged the market and then diverged from it as the shutdowns hurt business, Refintiv data shows, stretching stock valuations in ways that some strategists found hard to reconcile.


  Between Jan. 1 and Feb. 19, when the market first peaked this year, Wall Street’s consensus estimate for the S&P 500’s 2020 earnings per share was reduced by 0.9per cent, according to the data.


  Over the next month, as the markets fell sharply, the estimate fell 4.3per cent. Analysts kept cutting estimates as the economy tanked but the market rallied, reducing it by nearly 23per cent between March 23 and Aug. 25. The estimates have started to increase slightly since then.


  Citigroup strategists led by Tobias Levkovich raised their target on Aug. 24 to 3,300 from 2,900, and said the index could hit 3,600 by mid-2021. But they expressed reservations: “We still think the market may be ahead of itself.”


  Levkovich did not respond to requests for comment.


  Some have decided to throw in the towel on trying to forecast the market.


  Tony Dwyer, chief market strategist at financial services firm Canaccord Genuity Group Inc , said it was impossible to arrive at a sensible number. Dwyer suspended his forecast in March, then reinstated it over the summer before withdrawing it on Aug. 31 as the S&P 500 kept rising beyond his target.


  “It's a wild guess,” said Dwyer.


  Dwyer added that he believed the overall investment thesis he provides clients is more important “than a made-up target.”

BRUSELAS (AP) — La Unión Europea emprendió el jueves acciones legales contra Gran Bretaña por sus planes de aprobar una ley que incumpliría parte del acuerdo de divorcio legalmente vinculante firmado por ambas partes el año pasado. La iniciativa de la UE hacía patente el deterioro de las relaciones con Londres, que fue miembro del grupo hasta el 31 de enero. Las dos partes intentan cerrar un acuerdo comercial básico antes de final de año, aunque la lucha por la controvertida Ley británica de Mercado Interno ha tensado las relaciones este mes. La presidenta de la Comisión Europea, Ursula von der Leyen, indicó que el plan británico “por su propia naturaleza es una ruptura de la obligación de buena fe planteada en el Acuerdo de Salida”. “Si se aprueba como está, quedará en plena contradicción con el protocolo de Irlanda-Irlanda del Norte” contemplado en el acuerdo, afirmó. Los líderes europeos temen que la norma pueda llevar a la reimposición de una frontera dura entre Irlanda del Norte, que forma parte de Reino Unido, e Irlanda, miembro de la UE, y erosionar la estabilidad que ha respaldado la paz desde el Acuerdo del Viernes Santo de 1998. La UE había dado a Londres hasta el miércoles para retirar la ley. En lugar de eso, los parlamentarios británicos aprobaron el texto el martes por 340 votos a favor y 256 en contra en su última votación en la Cámara de los Comunes. “El plazo límite terminó ayer\", dijo Von der Leyen. \"Las cláusulas problemáticas no han sido eliminadas. De modo que esta mañana, la Comisión ha decidido enviar una carta de aviso formal al gobierno británico” que augura el inicio de una larga batalla legal. “La Comisión seguirá trabajando hacia una implementación plena y oportuna del Acuerdo de Salida”, afirmó. “Nos atenemos a nuestro...

“We have to get started. We have to have a plan,” the sheriff implored. “We keep spending thousands and thousands of dollars for temporary fixes ... We are wasting taxpayers’ money.”


  The county will likely construct a new facility, although county leaders could opt to refurbish the current facility or transport prisoners to nearby counties and not have a local jail at all.


  If county officials vote to build a new jail, taxpayers can expect an additional tax — a public safety income tax — down the road to pay for it. A new jail could cost about $15 million, according to information presented at the meeting.


  “I want the public to know where we’re headed with this, and to have it all out in the open,” council member Nick Robertson said.


  Officials said that tax might be close to 0.4%, twice the one passed on Monday, and another $200 a year for a median-income household.


  “Nobody wants to pay more taxes,” the sheriff said. “I know it’s a lot of money for a lot of people.”


  Council president Andy Wood made it clear that no decisions have been made, that all options are on the table and the county will try to spend “as little as possible.”

Cronin and his team examined all the candidates for the U.S. Senate, and also targeted 8 “geographies”: Colorado, Nevada, Montana, Arizona, Maine, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Michigan. “Our criteria was to focus on places” where their efforts could make the most difference, Cronin said. “Where elections were less than a 10 percent margin last time, where the outdoor community can have a sizable impact, and where there is a clear distinction on the ballot” between a candidate who respects science, and a science-denier. “In Colorado, we determined that the 3rd Congressional Race and the Senate race were perfect candidates for a voters’ guide deep dive,” Cronin said. “We also looked at the Jason Crow race in the 6th District, but decided that so many groups are working (to inform voters) on the Front Range, we wanted to concentrate on the Western Slope.”
 Another voter’s guide is out Saturday from the nonpartisan League of Women Voters.
 "We've published background information, as well as the pros and cons of each issue, on each of the 11 ballot issues," said Beth Hendrix, the league's executive director in Colorado. "Our 16 chapters around Colorado," including one based in Montrose, "typically go into municipal and county issues as well. You can find them all through our website LOWVColorado.org. Our ballot guide is written in even more layman's language than the Blue Book is," Hendrix said. "I'm pretty biased toward our Vote 411" website, she added, "where you can register to vote, track your ballot and learn about the candidates. Vote 411 has been growing exponentially each year. During the 2019 election, we had 91,000 people in Colorado use it. I bet we'll have half a million people use it this year. I hope we have 3.5 million people use it, which is the number of registered voters in Colorado. Let's work toward 100 percent turnout, and 100 percent informed voting." The citizens in this state have an advantage, given how streamlined mail-in voting has become here (vote-by-mail, or drop-in ballot box, has been available in Colorado since 2013). "Our counting system is quicker than other states, which have to wait for 10 days after Nov. 3 for the mail to come in," Hendrix said. "The Washington Post has declared Colorado the safest place to cast a vote" when it comes to making your vote count. "It should be noted that our election systems, for which we've received such renown, were implemented by a Republican, Wayne Williams. This is truly a nonpartisan state."

Usually, Vienna's trams can be seen gliding past Baroque palaces, but this winter, one of them will take on a new role: helping Viennese get the seasonal flu vaccine.


  The "vaccine tram" was unveiled on Thursday as part of a campaign being launched by the city to provide residents with free vaccinations and thereby reduce any potential pressure on hospitals from coronavirus patients.


  The Viennese are being urged to either register for a spot on the tram or to head to one of several health centres and around 600 doctors' offices where the vaccine is being administered.


  "We think we can have a threefold increase of the vaccination rate this year and we hope to motivate many Viennese to get vaccinated," Michael Ludwig, Vienna's mayor, said at an event to unveil the tram.


  He added that the city has acquired 400,000 vaccines, enough to cover about 25 percent of the population.


  "The aim is to get a large number of Viennese residents inoculated... so that the capacities in the hospitals remain free because we don't know what this winter will hold," in terms of coronavirus infections, Ludwig said.


  Currently, Vienna accounts for more than half of Austria's coronavirus infections, with close to 4,500 active cases.


  Medical experts have warned that the medical system could come under strain if it is forced to deal with an influx of seasonal flu and coronavirus patients at the same time.

  At the same time, EU and U.K. officials were continuing talks on a trade deal, going into detailed negotiations over everything from fisheries rights, state aid rules and legal oversight in case of disputes.


  Time is short for the U.K. and the EU to mend fences. A transition period that followed Britain’s Brexit departure ends in less than 100 days, on Dec. 31.


  The EU-U.K. trade negotiating session is supposed to wrap up Friday but expectations are that negotiations will continue right up to an Oct. 15-16 EU summit, which British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has set as a deadline for a deal. The EU said talks could continue right up to the end of the month.


  Britain says it wants a free trade deal along the lines of the one the EU has with Canada, allowing for goods to be traded with no tariffs or quotas.


  The EU says if the U.K. wants access to EU markets it must respect standards that EU companies have to live by since Britain is just too close to allow for undercutting rules that would allow for so-called “dumping” of U.K. merchandise at prices lower than in the EU.

Tolton head coach Taylor Bartlett completely trusted ace pitcher Paige Bedsworth to get the Trailblazers back on track Tuesday.


   


  Better yet, the senior further cemented her place in history.


   


  Tolton started the season with 13 consecutive wins before losing close games to Rock Bridge and Mexico. Bedsworth entered Tuesday night's game against New Bloomfield with 999 career strikeouts as she sought to lead Tolton back into the win column.


   


  Bedsworth carried the weight of becoming the 11th player in Missouri State High School Activities Association history to reach 1,000 career strikeouts as well as keeping Tolton from its first three-game losing streak since 2018.


   


  Bedsworth's answer was simple: near perfection.


   


  She fired 12 strikeouts and a no-hitter in the Trailblazers' 9-0 victory over New Bloomfield at American Legion Park.


   


  "She's had a great career so far," Bartlett said. "Hopefully we have a few more games left. Hopefully we've got a chance to play until the state championship.


   


  "... 1,000 strikeouts is really a great accomplishment."


   


  Freshman Madison Uptegrove led Tolton (14-2) with three RBIs and three runs in the rout.


   


  Bedsworth struck out five of the first six batters she faced while New Bloomfield (8-5) struggled defensively. New Bloomfield committed two errors in the first inning that led to an RBI sacrifice fly from Allie Widmer and another run when Uptegrove scored on a passed ball.


   


  After that, New Bloomfield freshman Peityn Thomas held the Trailblazers in check until the bottom of the fifth inning, when Uptegrove hit a two-run home run.


   


  Bartlett said the approach his team had at the plate was one of the best he's seen all year, and it showed in the bottom of the sixth. Tolton cycled through its lineup and got RBIs from Olivia Mobley, Uptegrove, Bedsworth and Widmer to take a 9-0 lead.


   


  Bedsworth followed her RBI single by returning to the circle to cap off her no-hitter.


   


  "I just tried not to think about it," Bedsworth said about closing in on 1,000 strikeouts. "I just think about it (as) another game and another batter. My goal is to always strike a batter out no matter what."


   


  Yet it was still surreal to achieve a goal Bedsworth has been talking about with her parents since playing varsity as a freshman.


   


  The Trailblazers are scheduled to play at St. Dominic (8-10) on Wednesday.

PULLMAN — Most Washington State University courses will continue to be delivered online during the spring semester.
 The plan for spring semester courses will be similar to the current fall semester on the Pullman campus where, with some exceptions, most courses are being held virtually, WSU Provost Elizabeth Chilton said.
 “For the spring, right now we’re going to do the same exception process, where most of our large lecture classes will continue to be offered remotely; but then there’ll be an exemption process that’s run through my office for the kinds of the instruction that really just cannot be done well remotely,” Chilton said Wednes-day during an online COVID-19 town hall.
 The exception process is dependent on factors like proper personal protective equipment, social distancing, testing protocols, the number of COVID-19 cases in the community and state and local COVID-19 guidelines.
 Dozens of classes, such as veterinary medicine classes, engineering labs and fine arts courses, are held in person across WSU’s campuses, while most other courses are online.
 Chilton said the university needs to ensure it can accommodate students who get sick or are exposed to the coronavirus.
 WSU will release the Pullman spring course schedule to students in mid- October, and it will indicate which classes will be held remotely or in person.
 Theresa Elliot-Cheslek, the school’s chief human resource officer, said the university hasn’t made a decision about the possibility of furloughs outside the athletics department, where noncontracted employees must take furloughs.
 “Currently the university is still continuing to evaluate the budget situation and making those final decisions as to what impacts we will all need to take and what actions are the appropriate ones, including furloughs,” she said. “So at this point that’s still undecided as how those should be applied.”
 She added that WSU isn’t offering employees incentives for early retirement.
 Starting this week, voluntary COVID-19 testing is available for all asymptomatic WSU employees free of charge until Nov. 20. The National Guard will administer tests at different locations in Pullman until Nov. 20. More information is available at hrs.wsu.edu/covid-19/covid-19-testing/.
 Employees with COVID-19 symptoms should contact their health care providers to seek care, said Kendra Wilkins-Fontenot, WSU’s director of disability services and labor relations.
 Ann Monroe, of WSU Human Resource Services, said the university’s health insurance plan will cover employees’ tests if they are experiencing symptoms. It also will cover their treatment if they test positive.
 Wilkins-Fontenot said that, as a result of the federal Families First Coronavirus Response Act passed in March, full-time employees who are parents can have as many as 12 weeks of time off to care for children. This includes parents of children who are learning from home because their schools are closed or only open part of the week.
 Employees who have been exposed to COVID-19 and are told to quarantine or isolate may be eligible for as many as 80 hours of paid leave as part of the federal act. Wilkins-Fontenot said the university can work with employees to find other options if they aren’t eligible for this leave.
 If an employee has to care for someone in their household who has COVID-19, they also may be eligible for as many as 80 hours of paid leave.

  On revenue projections it’s much easier to grow say from £50m to £1bn than from £1bn to £6bn. Percentages don’t always help. If they are to do so they will likely have to move into other product areas - like Next did with home - or further geographic expansion. Where will this £5bn come from?      It’s PER is 62.

Combined with ongoing talks between Steve Mnuchin and Nancy Pelosi over a long-awaited stage two US fiscal stimulus that lifted equity markets to a strong finish, although currencies, precious metals and energy contented themselves to mark time.

That's where voter's guides come in -- and over the next week, an increasing number of them will be appearing. The biggest of all the guides is the ballot information book, the so-called Blue Book, which is being printed and mailed to every "active registered" voter's household in Colorado Friday (it can be viewed online right now at leg.colorado.gov). Published by the Colorado Legislature, the guide takes its nonpartisan mission in earnest, said Cathy Eslinger, the book's research manager.
 “It’s a great responsibility. We’re required to produce a Blue Book whenever there’s a statewide issue on the ballot. We have specific writing teams devoted to each issue,” Eslinger explained of the process.
 The teams are charged with laying out the pros and cons of every ballot issue, which involves several back-and-forth drafts between various stakeholders and proponents to check for accuracy and thoroughness. The goal is not simply to satisfy both sides, pro and con, but to lay it all out in plain English that voters can understand.
 “We hope it’s a tool that people find useful,” Eslinger said. “It’s a very satisfying project, and one we take extremely seriously.”
 The Blue Book provides not only in-depth analyses of the 11 statewide ballot measures to be voted on this November, but also includes information on Colorado Supreme Court, Court of Appeals, and local district and county judges on the ballot, including whether each judge, as the guide puts it, “meets performance standards” (or fails to). Factual, comprehensive and nonpartisan though it may be, the guide does not assess a candidate’s position on an issue. That is where, if you are passionate on a subject, it helps to turn to groups who share your interests. Care deeply about protecting wildlife, for example? Adam Beitman, the Sierra Club’s deputy national press secretary, said there are numerous groups (besides his own) evaluating who is running this election season, and how to make your vote count.

Ironically enough, I did not sleep PEACEFULLY last night, because I was concerned about taking the wrong tone with this column about the iconic singer/songwriter/musician and anti-war activist who wrote “Give Peace A Chance.”
 Friday, October 9 marks the 80th anniversary of the birth of John Lennon (who was murdered by a deranged fan on December 8, 1980 at age 40).
 In honor of Lennon’s outspokenness, I hesitated about writing a fawning Beatles-fan puff piece; but neither did I want to lay too much criticism on a fellow fallible human being who isn’t here to defend himself.
 Then I got the idea of thinking of Lennon as a Facebook friend.
 Facebook allows you to experience the touchy-feely side of people you may know only casually. Likewise, the home movies in the video for Lennon’s “Beautiful Boy” (from the “Double Fantasy” album) genuinely tug at the heartstrings.
 Various Facebook memes let you see your friends in a different light (“What would your pirate name be?” and the like). I got choked up seeing actor Robert Carlyle’s cameo as a 78-year-old unassuming, non-celebrity Lennon in the 2019 fantasy movie “Yesterday.”
 Facebook shows you how your friends strive to grow and reinvent themselves. The Beatles COULD have hung on as a nostalgia act for decades, playing their “Ed Sullivan Show”-era hits at local dances and Rotary Club fundraisers; but (both before and after the breakup), Lennon thrived on innovation, experimentation and avant-garde aspirations, creating a deeper bond with the listeners and society.
 With Facebook, you get treated to previously unseen “glory days” snapshots of your friends. On a recent weekend, my wife, our son and I FINALLY got to watch and enjoy the zany 1965 Beatles movie “Help!”
 If you’re like me, you sometimes click “Like” without really scrutinizing all those vacation albums and kindergarten graduation albums that your friends inundate you with; but every now and then, you have the luxury of time. Lennon left a discography containing much more than commercial hits such as “Power to the People” and “Instant Karma” and I hope I live long enough to explore it.
 And, of course, SOMETIMES your friends – no matter how witty, talented and lovable they are – espouse political beliefs so wrongheaded that they convince you they were repeatedly dropped on their heads as youngsters.
 Yes, I’m thinking about “Imagine” (which some people would like to see replace the National Anthem). Although Lennon softened his interpretation of the message over the years, he was initially proud of having applied enough sugar- coating to lure unsuspecting millions into embracing an anti-religious, anti- nationalistic, anti-capitalistic philosophy.
 As with Facebook, I’m tempted to cope by rolling my eyes, agreeing to disagree and scrolling down to something less exasperating.
 But seriously – don’t just sway and chant. THINK about the implications of the lyrics. They’re not just naïve or impractical or misguided; they’re all those things ON STEROIDS.
 Imagine there’s no heaven? As if primordial ooze produced a genius such as Lennon? As if DREAMERS should relish the “fact” that all great musicians just CEASE TO EXIST?
 No possessions? Um, stereos are possessions, dude.
 Living for today?
 Yes, I’ll live for today. I’ll ALSO cherish my MEMORIES and plan for a FUTURE in which I employ a wide range of emojis to keep new generations aware of John Winston Lennon – warts and all.

Cyprus could be appeased if its partners underline their support in the final summit communique, or in a special statement from European Council President Charles Michel, who is chairing the two-day meeting. The leaders could then give a green light to sanctions against dozens of Belarus officials.


  National envoys could then quickly enact the sanctions in coming days, the EU diplomats said.


  Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said that “Turkey’s destabilizing actions in the eastern Mediterranean are unacceptable and exacerbate an already tense situation.”


  “Should the dialogue path not yield results, then the EU must be ready to consider other courses of action, such as expanded listings within the framework of the existing sanctions regime,” Lofven was quoted as saying by Swedish news agency TT before the summit, which Lofven won't attend because of his mother’s funeral.


  The dispute shines the spotlight on troubling old questions about the EU’s ability to act quickly and with one voice. The leaders will also discuss ties with China, but here too they are divided in how to approach a country that is a major trading partner yet poses serious economic and political challenges.


  It’s also possible that divisions will be exposed in other ways, given a worrying rise of authoritarianism in some member countries. A recent EU report on the state of the rule of law — the independence of the judiciary, corruption and media freedoms — has ruffled feathers and could be raised during the summit.


  Hungary and Poland are notably angry about the report and an attempt to link countries’ access to certain relatively generous kinds of EU funds to the way they run their democracies.


  The leaders will also hold brief talks on Brexit, scheduled for Friday, after the EU’s executive commission launched legal action against Britain for reneging on its commitments in the divorce agreement.

By validating your teenager’s feelings, you grant them the opportunity to be open and expressive with their feelings. Try phrases such as, “You are right, this is unfair” or “I feel that too, but it’s important that we do what we can to keep others safe.” Validating a teenager’s feelings will make them more accepting of whatever you say next.


  Your teen may feel frustrated that they have new restrictions placed on them when they have not been directly affected by this virus. Help teens make the connection by outlining the increased danger for older family and friends. This helps students understand that your fears aren’t far-fetched, and that what we do now makes a big difference down the road. You may also use the mask mandate and current restrictions as a way to teach compassion and the importance of keeping ourselves safe so we can keep others safe.


  If your student is going out with friends, incentivize them to comply with safety measures. Let them know if they are willing to take safety precautions seriously, they will have more freedom to spend time with friends.


  Make safety fun by practicing what talking to a friend from 6 feet apart looks like. Allow them to pick out a cool mask in which they can express themselves, and sit down with your teen to create a list of outdoor places where they could safely spend time with friends. Remind your student that your family rules may be different than their friends’ rules, but they are still the rules they must follow.


  It is important to remind your teen (and yourself) that even though we are in the middle of a difficult time, this pandemic, like other difficult times, will pass. Work as a team and keep communication open, factual, and honest with your student. Remember, what we do now will determine what will happen next.
