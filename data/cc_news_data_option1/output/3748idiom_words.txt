A 15-year-old girl was led into woodland by a stranger and forced to remove her clothing.
 The 'disturbing incident' has left the girl 'very shaken', according to Lancashire Police officers who are searching for the man.
 The teenager was approached in a wooded area just off Stonyhurst in Chorley broad daylight between 8.45am and 9.15am on Thursday morning (September 17).
 The man, believed to be in his 30s, asked the girl to follow him, leading her further into the woods and behind more trees.
 He threatened her and ordered her to remove items of clothing, before fleeing the scene.
 Detectives are now appealing for witnesses as they investigate the 'disturbing incident'.
