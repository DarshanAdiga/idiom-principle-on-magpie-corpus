BROCKTON -- In a matter of seven months, 5,000 people from Brockton have tested positive for COVID-19, accounting for more than 5 percent of the city's population, resulting in death, disruption and an ongoing struggle to return to normalcy.
 The city, with just fewer than 100,000 people according to the latest U.S. Census figures, has been one of the communities in Massachusetts that's been hit the worst by the coronavirus pandemic, more than doubling the state rate of approximately 2.1 percent of residents contracting COVID.
 Brockton was ripe for a high rate of infection due to many factors it shared with other communities with large coronavirus outbreaks, including the amount of front-line workers who reside in the city, working every day at grocery stores, hospitals, food manufacturers and other workplaces that were considered essential by the state government.
 Brockton has more front-line workers than any other community in the state, according to the city's pandemic consultant, Dr. Richard Herman, citing statistics gathered by the UMass Donahue Institute. The city, with its diverse population, has the fifth highest concentration of people or color among cities and towns throughout the state, and it ranks fourth in household size, Herman said.
 "Brockton was hit particularly hard because I think we have a lot of characteristics of our city that make the virus prone to spread rapidly," said Herman, in an interview with The Enterprise, as the city reaches the 5,000 mark for COVID-19 cases. "We know the virus has disproportionately affected people of color."
 Herman said it's important to understand how the coronavirus spreads.
 "What are the things the virus like?" he said. "The virus likes the indoors. It likes people being close to other people. It likes respiratory droplets. It likes overcrowding. It likes people who have face-to-face interaction, including people who have front-line service jobs. Brockton is number one in terms of front-line workers. All of these things make it more likely for the virus to spread."
 For the second week in a row, Brockton was in the "red," the highest risk category designated by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health on state's color-coded COVID-19 risk assessment map. Communities with more than eight cases per day per 100,000 people over a two-week period are high risk. Brockton had been in the "yellow" at moderate risk for five weeks before the recent "red" weeks.
 This comes after the onset of the coronavirus pandemic devastated the city during the spring, when Brockton topped 200 deaths less than two months after the city's first COVID-19 case was confirmed on March 14. For the first few months, Brockton was only behind the city of Chelsea for highest overall rate of infection, among all communities across the state.
 Now, as of Friday evening, seven months after coronavirus came to Brockton, the city's death toll stands at 294 and 5,000 total cases.
 The vast majority of coronavirus deaths in Brockton afflicted the elderly, including many residing in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities in the city, according to the Brockton Board of Health.
 The oldest person to get COVID-19 in Brockton was 104 years old, while the youngest was just one month old.
 Five of the people who died of COVID-19 in Brockton were over 100 years old; 56 who died were between ages 90 and 100; 85 who died were between the ages 80 and 90; 80 who died were between the ages of 70 and 80; 44 died between the ages of 60 and 70; 20 died between the ages of 50 and 60; two died between the ages 40 and 50; and one died in the 30 to 40 age group.
 "Early on at the end of March, and throughout the month of April and into May, we were really hit very hard, like much of Massachusetts," Herman said.
 Since then, the deaths caused by coronavirus inside Brockton nursing homes have slowed down, Herman said.
 "They have their situations far more under control," Herman said.
 For every 100,000 people in Brockton, 5,194 have now been infected, which puts it sixth in the state in terms of highest overall COVID-19 transmission rates, below communities including Chelsea (9,350 per 100,000 people), Lawrence (6,574), Lynn (5,339), Revere (5,282) and Everett (5,243).
 But the actual amount of people who contracted the coronavirus in Brockton and other communities may have been much higher than that, due to the amount of cases that went undetected, especially during the early onset of the pandemic when the availability of testing was limited, according to one expert. He uses mathematical models to study the spread of infectious diseases and compared the City of Champions to hard-hit neighborhoods in densely populated New York City.
 "We could be on the order of 10 to 20 percent exposed and infected with the virus. I think that's a reasonable estimate," said Stephen Kissler, research fellow in the Department of Immunology and Infectious Diseases at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, when asked about the case count in Brockton. "Early in the pandemic, we didn't have a lot of testing capacity. There were a lot of cases we missed then. I would imagine, as Massachusetts was seeing a lot of its transmission earlier this spring, there were probably a lot of undetected cases in Brockton and across Massachusetts and the country as well."
 However, this level of COVID-19 cases in the community likely wouldn't be enough to allow Brockton residents to develop heard immunity, which is the protection a community can receive after a sufficient amount of the population has received a vaccination or survived the virus, making it difficult for the disease to spread.
 "According to all of the best estimates I have available, that's still far too few to achieve herd immunity in the sense of preventing major outbreaks from happening, as we've seen in New York City where we have seen 60 percent in some neighborhoods," Kissler said. "A herd immunity threshold of 10 to 20 percent is too low. It seems like even in the very hardest hit communities in country, there are still plenty of people susceptible to sustain outbreaks into the winter."
 Brockton is among 63 communities in Massachusetts, of the 351 cities and towns across the state, that were recently put into the "red" status by the state. Mayor Robert Sullivan was asked by a school committee member what was the root cause behind the recent spike in cases that led to the elevated risk level, which has caused city officials to continue opting for remote online learning, rather than returning children to the classroom.
 Sullivan couldn't put a precise reason behind the recent uptick, although the mayor said he has noticed some city residents getting lax about following public health guidelines designed to slow the spread.
 "I can honestly say there's no specific root cause. I can't say there was a massive party that was a cluster," Sullivan said. "I think it's a combination of different things. Quite honestly, I think some people have gotten complacent. ... I have seen decreased mask-wearing. Parties still happen. They've been minimized, but they are still happening."
 Sullivan said he feared that it wouldn't be safe to allow Brockton Public School students to return to in-person classes anytime soon, following the recent "red" designation.
 "We have to take a hard look and say what the heck is going on," the mayor said.
 Herman said city leaders want to get kids back in school, but want to do so safely.
 "That is the number one priority right now, to get the number down, so kids can get back to school," he said.
 Herman said ultimately life will not be able to return to normal in Brockton until a vaccine or an effective treatment is available, while a vaccine could take much longer to develop. Herman said he's hopeful that monoclonal antibodies treatments can become available to the masses sometime this year, while a vaccine is not expected until at least next year. Herman noted that President Donald Trump took the antibody treatment created by Regeneron, a biotech company that recently requested emergency use approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
 "That is an incredibly promising treatment," Herman said. "A single dose can decrease the viral lode by 99 percent in seven days. It represents the best immediate hope we have to treat folks that have been infected. As I've said many times, in the history of man versus pandemic, man is rarely the winner. The best we can do right now is try and keep things under control as best we can with the measures we have, until science gets a chance to catch up, give us a treatment and a vaccine."

TAUNTON -- Right now, the Silver City Galleria is a bizarre and beautiful sight to behold.
 Hosting the approximately 15,000 pieces of furniture and other items from New York City's famously ritzy Waldorf Astoria hotel while they are up for auction, the mall is a strange tribute to 20th century America.
 Where once was a Champs Sports, elegant furniture from a suite where 16 American presidents stayed fills the space. Where once was a Radio Shack, there sits the custom-ordered furniture used by Gen. Douglas MacArthur for decades.
 In a whirlwind of assorted furniture from different cultures and eras, the luxury and glamour of the mid-1900s meets the now-dying mall culture of the 1990s, covering the entire first floor of the Galleria with everything from 17th century portraits to 20th century French ormolu mounted cabinets.
 It was nothing but the best for the rich and famous guests of the Waldorf Astoria. But now that so many of its expensive pieces are up for bid, bargain hunters have a chance to snag some of the historic hotel's high end furniture.
 We can deliver news just like this directly to your inbox. You can sign up for This Just In (a daily newsletter that comes out at 7:30 p.m. each evening with items we've posted that day), News Alerts (so you don't miss anything important), our Daily Newsletter (sent each morning) and more. It's customized to your preferences -- and it'll only take a few seconds.
 Cliff Schorer, art consultant to the sale, said that because there is simply so much that needs to go, prices have been driven down from the thousands to the tens for lots of quality items.
 "The lowest starting price is $10. But you'll see there's not a lot of super low-end things. Probably the smallest thing is a nightstand from a bedroom or a crystal lamp," he said. "And generally they bought the best of the best, so the products they have are really good."
 Bidders will be able to find almost any household item or decoration they can think of. There are couches and chairs with the finest upholstery. There are tables, desks, cabinets and chests with beautiful golden accents. There are all kinds of decorations to suit your home, from porcelain Chinese vases to framed photos of people like Marilyn Monroe, John F. Kennedy, Herbert Hoover and Richard Nixon. And all of it will go for a tiny fraction of what it was originally purchased for.
 "It's enough furniture, we figure, for about 1,000 houses because there's a lot of big, big furniture today," Schorer said. "You can get a bedroom set and a dining room set for the average house."
 But there are also deals for businesses as well, especially restaurant owners. The benches and tables from the hotel's upscale restaurants are all for sale, and there is enough to easily furnish more than one restaurant in its entirety. Schorer said days four and six of the auction will be especially fruitful for those looking for a bargain.
 There are, of course, also items that will go for thousands of dollars, such as the 26 pianos up for grabs. The auction offers everything from the Steinway Model M to Boston and Yamaha brands. A set of pillows featuring the Duchess of Windsor's pug dogs are also very popular.
 But how did all this historic luxury end up in the Silver City? According to Schorer, when the hotel closed four years ago after being sold to a new owner, all the old furniture was shipped up to a warehouse in upstate New York where it stayed for three-and-a-half years while they decided what to do with it.
 "In the end, they decided to reuse only the very important historical things -- a handful of things," he said.
 The rest was donated to St. Bartholomew's Church -- a historic building across from the hotel -- to fund its restoration and preservation. The church hired the auction company to sell the furniture in the hopes of raising at least $2 million.
 But Schorer said finding a space for the auction was a huge challenge.
 "There were no spaces big enough. This was probably the cleanest, driest, well-lit space with over a million square feet that was available," he said.
 And then they had to make the mall suitable for holding the furniture as well as hosting the auction. To do so, they had to get a special permit from the city, install increased security, clean up the space and make sure the water and power were running correctly after being off for so long.
 The furniture was transported to the mall in 88 trucks, and took 416 hours of unloading over the course of 26 days to get into the mall. Schorer said they still haven't finished cataloguing.
 On Wednesday, Joan Hagianis drove down from Marlboro with her daughter to see the collection. She grew up in Manhattan, and said she used to walk through the hotel in its heyday.
 "It's bringing back memories," she said. "...As a young person you'd go through like 'Ooh, aah. Look at this, look at that!'"
 Hagianis said she would sometimes bump into celebrities such as Myrna Loy and Bela Lugosi as she walked through. But so as not to be so gauche, she never asked for autographs.
 So far, Schorer said, Hagianis is one of the few visitors who has come by to look at the collection in person. But the collection has had tens of thousands of bids online.
 The auction is maintaining strict social distancing rules, requires mask- wearing, has a self-imposed limit of 525 people in the building at a time and has guests fill out a questionnaire and have their temperature taken as they walk in to ensure anyone who wants to see the splendor first-hand will be safe inside the building.
 But bidders need not leave their homes to participate. Online bidding is already open at kaminskiauctions.com, and items will start to be auctioned off Saturday, Oct. 17, 2020 through both the online platform and in-person simultaneously.
 The auction will last two weeks, after which those who purchased furniture will pick up their items. All of the items must be out by Nov. 15, and anything not purchased will be donated to charity.

SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run Director Speaks on How Coronavirus Affected the Release

The budget in which her salary was cut was approved in August 2019, yet her resignation was tendered more than a year later — just before a high-profile election with an anticipated high turnout.
 If county commissioners had any inkling that Luedecke was considering leaving her job, they should have made sure that her assistant was thoroughly trained and ready to take over her duties, if necessary.
 Last week, the county named Matthew Dutton — the assistant elections administrator — as the interim chief administrator. Certainly, Dutton is getting a trial by fire, given the magnitude of the election and its accompanying challenges. Hopefully, he and his departmental staff will be able to make the necessary adjustments to ensure a relatively smooth election process from here on in.
 After Tuesday’s chaotic start, the subsequent days have proved more encouraging.
 As of Thursday, wait times at most locations were down to 45 minutes, and some voters reported completing the entire process in only 10 minutes.
 That’s certainly encouraging, and as election workers become more familiar with the hardware and better versed in election procedures, it’s likely that the process will become even more efficient as the early voting period progresses.
 That’s important, because the whole point of having three weeks of early voting this election — instead of the traditional two — is to encourage greater participation at the ballot box.
 When electronic glitches and inadequately trained election workers contribute to delays that leave hundreds of people waiting in line for hours at a time, the benefit of the expanded voting period could be lost.
 Hopefully, the system in place will allow everyone who wants to vote in person to cast their ballot as quickly and easily as possible between now and Oct. 30, the end of early voting. And of course, polls will be open for 12 hours on Election Day, Nov. 3.
 But in moving forward, county officials should seriously consider adding more polling places for early voting, especially in presidential elections. Bell County has just six locations countywide, and the fact that Killeen, a city of 150,000 residents, has just two polling sites is problematic.
 The location of Killeen’s polling sites is also an issue, with both sites in the northern part of the city — effectively discouraging participation by residents in the other parts of town. Adding a third location at the Lions Park Community Center on Stan Schlueter Loop would go a long way to addressing the problem.
 This is a critical election, with voters deciding races ranging from city council to Congress, from JP to president.
 It’s our county officials’ solemn responsibility to ensure that every eligible voter is afforded the opportunity to be heard at the ballot box — and not have to jump through hoops to do so.
 To those who have waited in long lines to vote in the last few days, thank you for your patience, thank you for your resolve, and thank you for your commitment to our system of democracy.
 For those who haven’t yet cast your ballots, don’t be deterred by reports of electronic glitches, long lines or lack of parking. There are 13 more days to go to the polls during early voting, including weekends and expanded weekday hours.
 Choose a day, choose a time — then choose your candidates.
 It may take a little longer this year, but it will be well worth your investment.

VALHERMOSO SPRINGS, Ala. (WAFF) - We’re just 19 days away from the election.A Morgan County woman woke up to find her car tagged and signs supporting Joe Biden and Doug Jones covered in paint.And people in North Alabama are going out of their way to make a political statement - legal or not.“At first I thought it said traitor with a ‘t’, I looked again and saw it said Trump," Vicky Gibbons said.Vicky Gibbons, who lives off of Highway 36 East in Valhermoso Springs, woke up to find her car spray painted to spell ‘Trump’ in bright orange letters Thursday morning.Gibbons says she put signs in her yard supporting Doug Jones, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris earlier this week. Two two days later she found her car and her signs vandalized.“I thought about getting new signs, so I decided no I’ll just leave these spray painted ones up and let people see what a Trump supporter did. That is a good typical Christian Trump supporter," Gibbons said.“No this is the behavior of a classic criminal," Tom Fredericks said.Tom Fredericks with the Morgan County Republican Executive Committee says this type of behavior is not okay.“It’s an indication of how far we’ve polarized politics in America and I don’t like it. I think we need to come together. We need to recognize political differences, but at the end of the day, we’re Americans," Gibbons said.Fredericks says the problem isn’t one sided. He tells us over 500 Trump signs have been stolen out of yards in Morgan County this election cycle.Gibbons says she filed a police report with the Sheriff’s Office, and a local auto shop removed the paint for free.“It is a crime and we will try to prosecute when we can find whoever did it,” Mike Swafford said.Public information officer Mike Swafford says the person responsible will be arrested, brought to jail and charged with a misdemeanor.Copyright 2020 WAFF.

WILCOX COUNTY, Ala. (WSFA) - A little while back, we told you about a group of students forced to do their school work crammed inside a car parked next to a school bus with internet access.Those students no longer have to do that after a couple from Huntsville stepped in to foot the bill.Cassandra Rudolph’s children only have the option to do virtual learning. In September, this left them crammed in a hot car relying on buses with internet to learn.A viewer saw this this story and now pays for their internet so the students can work from home.We followed up with the family Friday.“In the house it’s way cooler than in the car," said Jayla McWilliams.McWilliams said the space allows her to focus on her schoolwork instead of being bunched up with her siblings.“Now they sit down comfortably and focus on what they’re doing," said Rudolph.Reaction poured in from across the state after the story aired. People asked to buy the students headphones, pay for their internet, and offered workspaces.Keith Matthews and his wife said they “couldn’t believe” what they saw.“Me having children myself, I mean, I can’t imagine them being in the same room much less in the same vehicle, trying to have a beneficial virtual learning experience,” Matthews said.Matthews and his wife now pay for the family’s internet.“It was a no brainer,” he explained. “For me, it was it was an easy opportunity to help some children.”The students said they feel “blessed" that someone would help them.Rudolph did receive an internet voucher in the mail from the state. This is a program meant to help students connect to the internet from home.Rudolph said only one internet provider was listed on the voucher and that provider said they could not connect the family.Local education leaders provided the family with a hotspot, but Rudolph said it was spotty and could not handle five children working. Rudolph had also bought two separate hotspots which also had poor connection.This left the family with very few options until Matthews stepped in to help.“I really appreciate that,” Rudolph said. “My heart goes out.”Copyright 2020 WSFA 12 News.

LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) — The Arkansas Supreme Court ruled that two proposed amendments will not be removed from the general election ballot next month, upholding a lower court's decision to dismiss the case against the secretary of state. Tom Steele, chairman of the Arkansas Term Limits committee, filed the lawsuit against Republican Secretary of State John Thurston in an effort to remove two separate ballot measures. Steele argued that ballot titles for Issue 2 and Issue 3 are misleading, insufficient and fail to inform voters of their specific proposals and, as a result, the substantial changes made by the two amendments constitute manifest fraud. Last month, Pulaski County Circuit Court dismissed the lawsuit, and Steele appealed that decision to the state Supreme Court, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported. The high court ruled Thursday that Steele's appeal did not overcome the ”‘enormous hurdle’ of the manifest fraud standard,” the court said. “Thus, viewing the facts in the complaint in the light most favorable to Steele, we hold that the circuit court properly ruled that Issue 2 and Issue 3 comply with the requirements of article 19, section 22 of the Arkansas Constitution,” the court concluded. One proposed amendment, Issue 3, would make it more difficult to qualify proposed constitutional amendments, initiated acts or referendum. Another ballot measure, Issue 2, would eliminate lifetime term limits for state lawmakers. The court also ruled that the ballot titles “sufficiently identify and distinguish the proposed amendments from others on the ballot and in the public.” Steele’s attorney, David Couch, disagreed with the court's decision in a statement. “No voter will actually know what they are voting for when they cast their vote on...

 With most votes counted, Ardern's liberal Labour Party was winning 49% of the vote compared to 27% for its main challenger, the conservative National Party.
 Labour was on target to win an outright majority of the seats in Parliament, something that hasn't happened since New Zealand implemented a proportional voting system 24 years ago. Typically, parties must form alliances to govern, but this time Ardern and Labour can go it alone.

Although it’s possible the final calculation will keep the region in the red tier, the situation “is just too close for comfort,” Wooten said.
 In addition to the oft-repeated advice of washing hands, distancing socially and wearing masks to help keep case rate totals low, people were asked to avoid crowded places and skip house and dinner parties. Employers were encouraged to allow workers to telecommute.
 And everyone was reminded to stay home while sick.
 Wooten acknowledged that these sorts of measures won’t affect the state’s next two case rate assessments. That’s because the dates the state will assess on Tuesday have already come and gone. And most of the dates that will be assessed the following Tuesday have also passed.
