“I’m so happy for the record. It is thanks to my teammates, they help me in these nine years,” said Aguero after netting a hat-trick against Villa. “When I scored the second, I thought one more [and] I break the hat-trick record. I want to keep scoring more goals,” he added.
 Aguero’s efforts in the three-and-a-half seasons that Guardiola has been in charge at the Etihad have been all the more impressive given many thought the Argentina international would not fit into the Catalan manager’s demanding style of play.
 Brazilian Gabriel Jesus was seen as an immediate successor to Aguero but the veteran had other ideas and, after leading City to their first Premier League title in 2012, has been a central figure during the most successful years in the club’s history.

The Supreme Court asked the Enforcement Directorate ED on Monday to attach Indian properties of JP Morgan, which engaged in a transaction with the now-defunct Amrapali Group to allegedly siphon off home buyers money in violation of the Foreign Exchange Management Act FEMA and FDI norms. The ED said it had prima facie found violations of FEMA norms by the US-based JP Morgan and that a complaint in this regard was lodged.The Supreme Court also allowed the ED to take into custody the defunct groups CMD, Anil Kumar Sharma, and two other directors, Shiv Priya and Ajay Kumar, who are behind bars on the top courts order, for interrogation as regards alleged money-laundering offences. It said the central agency could take them into custody immediately and once their interrogation was over, they could be sent back to a prison here.According to the share subscription agreement between JP Morgan and Amrapali Group, the US-based firm had invested Rs 85 crore on October 20, 2010 to have a preferential claim on profits in the ratio of 75 per cent to JP Morgan and 25 per cent to the promoters of Amrapali Homes Project Private Limited and Ultra Home. Later, the same number of shares was bought back from JP Morgan for Rs 140 crore by two companies -- Ms Neelkanth and Ms Rudraksha -- owned by a peon and an office boy of Amrapalis statutory auditor Anil Mittal.A bench of justices Arun Mishra and U U Lalit was told by ED Joint Director Rajeshwar Singh, who is supervising the probe against JP Morgan, that the MNC remitted the money back to the United States. They JP Morgan have a lot of properties in India. We want you to attach their office or corporate properties of a like amount. Then they will come running to us and we will see to it, the bench said.Singh said the adjudication process against the firm had begun in accordance with law. On December 2 last year, the ED had informed the top court that it had prima facie found evidence of violation of FEMA by the multi-national firm and recorded the statements of the country head of the company with regard to dealings with the Amrapali Group.It had said though the investigation was underway, prima facie it appeared that there were also violations of the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act PMLA and that appropriate actions were being taken. The apex court had then directed the ED that the investigation should be carried out impartially, properly and expeditiously within a period of three months.On July 23 last year, the Supreme Court had cracked its whip on errant builders for breaching the trust of home buyers, ordered cancellation of Amrapali Groups registration under real estate law RERA and ousted it from its prime properties in the NCR by nixing the land leases. It had ordered a probe by the ED into allegations of money laundering and to look into the charge of FEMA violation by JP Morgan.The money of the home buyers has been diverted. The directors diverted the money by the creation of dummy companies, realising professional fees, creating bogus bills, selling flats at an undervalued price, payment of excessive brokerage etc. They obtained investment from JP Morgan in violation of FEMA and FDI norms, the top court had said. It had said the equity shares of the group were purchased at an exorbitant price to suit the requirements of JP Morgan and the Amrapali Zodiac Developers Pvt Ltd had diverted home buyers funds.The shares were overvalued for making payments to JP Morgan. It was adopted as a device for siphoning off the money of the home buyers to foreign countries, the top court had said as it accepted the reports of forensic auditors. It had also noted that the shares of Amrapali Zodiac from JP Morgan were ultimately purchased for Rs 140 crore by Ms Neelkanth and Ms Rudraksha, shell companies owned by a peon and an office boy respectively.The transactions of Amrapali Zodiac Developers Pvt Ltd with JP Morgan were clearly in order to avoid the provisions of the Companies Act, it had said. The Supreme Court had said it was apparent that Ms Rudraksha was created for money laundering as its two directors and shareholders had no income.

JOHANNESBURG - African National Congress (ANC) treasurer-general Paul Mashatile said that the ruling party was committed to strengthening state- owned entities, with the energy sector identified as a top priority.
 Mashatile said that while government had announced a number of initiatives to tackle the crisis at Eskom and that the country must look at alternatives, including renewable energy.
 He said that he believed one of the solutions was moving Eskom from Public Enterprises to the Energy Department.
 Mashatile said that this would assist in policy and implementation.
 "You have a minister of energy whose responsibility is to sort out energy policy and implementation but you have another big institution that doesn't sit with that ministry. I think that in the long run, it is creating problems."

US President Donald Trump is facing criticism from a wide range of figures for threatening to freeze Iraq&rsquo;s account at the New York Fed.&nbsp;Critics of the threat, who include former government officials and Washington insiders, said the move amounted to &lsquo;blackmail&rsquo;, &lsquo;extortion&rsquo; and &lsquo;imperialism&rsquo;.The controversy follows an Iraqi parliamentary resolution that asked foreign troops, including US soldiers, to leave the country.&nbsp;Trump has warned he&rsquo;ll impose sanctions on Baghdad if it follows through on the resolution, which was spearheaded by lawmakers angry over the US assassination of a top Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani, in Iraq.&nbsp;The outgoing Iraqi Prime Minister Adil Abdul Mahdi has already asked US officials to prepare for the withdrawal of American soldiers.&nbsp;The Wall Street Journal on Saturday reported that the US State Department has warned that Iraq&rsquo;s central bank could be stopped from accessing its account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.&nbsp;&nbsp;Developing countries, such as Iraq prefer keeping some of their foreign exchange reserves with the Fed to access the US dollar and make international payments.&nbsp; The money that Iraq keeps at the Fed largely comes from the sale of oil. While the exact amount remains unclear, AFP, citing an unnamed Iraqi official, reported that the balance stands at $35bn.&nbsp;The money is flown to Iraq in dollar bills on a monthly basis.&nbsp;Central banks and governments from around the world keep trillions of dollars at the Fed as it allows them access to the US dollar, the world&rsquo;s most dominant currency.&nbsp;Information about the accounts and transactions is confidential but the US government has in the past used its leverage to gain access to it.&nbsp;In theory, the Fed functions independently of the US government&rsquo;s foreign policy. But that&rsquo;s not always the case.&nbsp;In 2015, the Fed temporarily suspended the flow of the US dollar to Iraq citing concerns the funds were ending up in the hands of Iranian banks and Daesh.&nbsp; Linking the Fed account with US foreign policy objectives is also not uncommon. In 2008, the US arm-twisted Iraq into agreeing to its military strategy by threatening to freeze the account.&nbsp; Any disruption in the flow of the dollars would have a devastating impact on the government budget, which drives 90 percent of its revenue from oil.&nbsp;The Iraqi government is struggling to pacify a burgeoning young population, which is competing for limited public sector jobs, after last year&rsquo;s violent protests.&nbsp;Washington can block individuals and entities from accessing the US financial system on the pretext of violation of its sanctions such as those on Iran or the like with which Trump has threatened Iraq.&nbsp;The US has time and again used the dominant position of the dollar as a preferred currency and medium of exchange to force other countries to toe the line on its policies. &nbsp;Sanctions can cut an entity - individual or business - from the global financial system as banks refuse to process transactions in fear of US penalties.&nbsp;

Valuing Agios
 I understand investor frustration with the slow rollout of Tibsovo. On the bright side, it looks like a drug that will keep building revenue over a long period of time, until its patents expire. In time it seems likely that all AML patients with IDH1 mutations will try Tibsovo. This will be expanded to cholangiocarcinoma and then MDS. Which tumors will be prioritized after that is unclear, but I think any tumor that tests positive for IDH1 is fair game.
 Vorasidenib and mitapivat potential commercialization are also on the horizon, pending FDA approval. EU approvals are also in the pipeline. As revenue flows in I expect to see the pipeline expanded as well. But all that will require a considerable cash burn. Any faltering in revenue growth could frighten investors and make it hard to raise more cash.
 As I mentioned above, in the past Agios stock price has been over $100 per share, and this year it sank as low as $28.36. That is an enormous differential. It closed on January 6, 2020 at $48.49, giving it a market capitalization of over $3.2 billion. Clearly investors see a great deal of value in the future. I own the stock, and I am a long-term investor, so I am going to reserve judgment for now. I will be looking for Q4 Tibsovo revenue to continue to ramp. Even if it goes over $20 million for the first time, I would remain cautious. If it goes over $25 million, I would call that a bullish signal. We should see Q4 results towards the end of January or early February. But the real value should be over the longer, multi-year run.

The Supreme Court Monday asked four senior advocates to convene a meeting to decide on re-framing and adding issues to be deliberated by it in the matter relating to discrimination against women in various religions and religious places including Kerala's Sabarimala Temple. A 9-judge Constitution bench, headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde, commenced the hearing on the matter referred to it by a 5-judge bench on November 14 last year on various issues including evolving a judicial policy to deal with matters relating to religions, their essential practices and the scope of judicial interventions.
 At the outset, senior advocate Indira Jaising, who has been appearing in Sabarimala and other matters, opposed the reference. She said without holding that the Sabarimala judgement was wrong, the matter could not have been referred to a larger bench and moreover, the 7-judge bench verdict in the Shirur Mutt case has not been doubted or assailed to justify a reference to the larger bench.
 "We are not hearing the review petitions in the Sabarimala case. We are only on the reference points," the bench clarified. Jaising said: "There is no defect in the (Sabarimala) judgment. The reference order only says that the issues arising in cases of entry of Muslim women in mosques, rights of a Parsi woman married to a Non-Parsi and the practice of Female Genital Mutilation by the Dawoodi Bohra community may overlap with the issues in that judgment, and that the prospect of the reference of those issues to a larger bench cannot be ruled out.
 "No competent court has said that Sabarimala judgment is bad in law. If Your Lordships say it is not correct, only then will subsequent questions arise." She said that the issues raised in the reference order were "academic in nature" and it was not possible for the court to answer them without dealing with the facts of the case.
 "If necessary, only for the purpose of reference to facts, and not for decision, we can list all those cases", the bench said. Jaising said that Hindu, Muslim and Parsi laws cannot be governed under the same regime and a common judicial decision was not possible.
 Senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan said the court needs to examine the facts of the each case to arrive at a decision. Senior Counsel A M Singhvi, appearing for Dewasom Board, said the issue before the court was "the interplay of freedom of religion, Article 25 and 26, Article 14, Article 21 and other provisions of Part III of the Constitution. It doesn't mean 5-6 Chapters of the Constitution. Such a sweep would shake every case-law from 1950".
 He said the matter was extremely sensitive and sought time for preparing arguments in the case. Solicitor General Tushra Mehta also agreed with Singhvi and said that issues to be dealt by the bench needed to be fine-tuned.
 "We may list all the cases, Dawoodi Bohra, Mosque entry, Parsi woman, before us for facts, even though we won't decide them," the bench said. The bench categorically said that for the time being, it was not venturing into the issues of polygamy and nikah halala pertaining to Muslims.
 The bench also rejected the plea that lawyer Mathews J Nedumpara, who has been barred by a judgement from appearing before the apex court, be allowed to argue in the Sabarimala case. "We will not review Justice Nariman's judgment (debarring advocate Nedumpara)", the bench said.
 The top court said the 9-judge bench will proceed chronologically with the hearing, starting with the Sabarimala case as it was the "oldest" matter.

It was Oshima Brothers, an indie-folk-pop music group from Belfast, and they were shooting a music video for an atmospheric love song called “Lost at Sea.” And because Sean Oshima, 25, and Jamie Oshima, 22, are awash in creativity, but not cash, they took a low-budget approach. They used instruments they didn’t mind getting wet and salty, and for a camera they used an iPhone tucked in a Mason jar in order to get underwater shots.

En nuestro caso, es en el verano donde más aumenta el consumo de energía dado que se intensifica el uso del aire acondicionado y esto amplía la necesidad de más gas. Lo que pasó en 2016 y parte de este año es que hubo una disminución en la demanda de gas, debido a que la recesión económica golpeó fuerte al país provocando una disminución en la actividad económica que está relacionada con el consumo de energía. El segundo aspecto a tomar en cuenta, es que hubo abundantes lluvias que beneficiaron a las hidroeléctricas lo que permitió a la industria optar por este tipo de energía, y esto sin dudas que tuvo un impacto en la demanda de gas.

While talking to _TRT World_ , he took breaks to attend to the newly arriving patients. Just days before, he treated a 14-year-old boy who was shot in the leg while trying to escape the Iranian authorities to avoid deportation. "We provided him first aid, and rushed him to the hospital about nine kilometres away," he said. "I have attended all kinds of cases; victims of torture, bullet injuries, physical abuses and sexual abuses."
 Mohammadi was himself a refugee in Iran. About 14 years ago, as he returned to Afghanistan through the Zero Point, he started working at the clinic a volunteer. "We had little resources and nearly no staff. I built this place from scratch because I love what I get to do here. I can make a difference," he said.
 For the first 16 months, he worked for free. "As someone who has lived in the very situation as these people, I can relate to their problems better than anyone else. I am able to empathise with them and help them in a more personal way," he said.
 While they have come a long way, the clinic is still underfunded, and in need of resources and additional staff, especially to work with women and children. In fact, owing to the location of the Refugee Reception Centre, close to the border and away from the city, only a handful of women work there, of which three, including Noorjahan, are with the clinic.
 But despite little financial reward, Mohammadi and his small staff remain committed to providing the best healthcare possible in the most dire circumstances, working long hours, and at times unpaid. "When I am reminded of all the injustice and pain they suffered, it motivates me to work harder. I cry for the victims I see everyday," he said, choking back tears.
 His colleague Noorjahan is also intimately familiar with refugee life, as she has been a war refugee in Iran herself at one point in time in her life.
 "It's hard to do this job, to watch our people, especially the women, in distress," she said. "Having been a refugee, I understand their pain. I know what the ground reality is in Iran and I can feel their suffering as I have lived through some of it myself."

I mounted the Spolar to an existing B&D workmate bench and laid a 3/4″ plywood over the top and mounted the press and went to town and never returned. WOW, this thing is slick!. After the thrill wore off I decided to do a gauge change and set it up for loading 28 gauge. As stated in the book, it requires a 1/2″, 9/16″ wrench and two allen wrenches to change it over. Approximate time to perform a gauge change is 10 minutes and that includes changing powder and shot. For me, the process take a little longer, I have to CLEAN everything before I go back to work, add 10 minutes.
