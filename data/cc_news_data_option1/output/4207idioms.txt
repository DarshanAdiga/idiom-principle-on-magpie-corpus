Il frutto miracoloso di cui stiamo parlando è il lampone. E a svelarci le sue proprietà nella prevenzione di malattie come l’Alzheimer è una ricerca condotta dal Torrey Pines Institute for Molecolar Studies. Gli studiosi hanno confrontato quasi 2.000 sostanze contenute in questo frutto, con quelle presenti nei farmaci utilizzati. E hanno notato come i lamponi possano migliorare il livello di attenzione di ognuno di noi e la nostra memoria. Ma non è l’unico studio in favore di questa tesi. A intervenire, anche uno studio della Tufts University, che ha confermato questa teoria. Perciò, il declino cognitivo che si presenta a causa dell’Alzheimer, può essere combattuto a tavola per cominciare!

Wes Whipkey threw three touchdown passes and Corey Wise made a triumphant return from a knee injury with two long scoring runs as West Greene improved to 2-3 overall on a night when playing a game at all was up in the air just a few days ago.
 The Pioneers were originally scheduled to host Monessen and celebrate senior night and homecoming Friday night, but the Greyhounds wound up forfeiting their final three games due to a dwindling roster.
 Athletic director Bill Simms found out Brownsville was suddenly off also with COVID-19 issues at Southmoreland forcing the Scotties to postpone their game Friday night as well. The Falcons, under first-year coach Ramont Small, agreed to come to West Greene for a non-conference match-up.
 "We were on eggshells because we heard rumors that Monessen was going to forfeit," Pioneers coach Brian Hanson said. "It's hard to prepare for a team if you don't know if you're going to have a game or not. I'm glad it worked out and we got a game in."
 West Greene was able to honor seniors Wyatt Hoag, Brayden Mooney and Hayden Ross.
 The Pioneers wasted little time taking control of the game against the Falcons (0-6), jumping out to a 20-0 lead in the first quarter as Whipkey threw touchdown passes of 30 yards to Dalton Lucey and 20 yards to Nathan Orndoff before Wise broke free for a 34-yard TD run.
 West Greene extended its lead to 47-0 by halftime on a 2-yard scoring pass from Whipkey to Orndoff and touchdowns runs of 20 yards by freshman Colin Brady, 59 yards by Wise and 5 yards by freshman Seth Burns.
 Whipkey was 5-for-5 passing for 79 yards. Orndoff had three receptions for 49 yards and two TDs and Lucey had a pair of catches for 30 yards and one score.
 "I thought we played well," Hanson said. "I know Brownsville is a little shorthanded. We've been shorthanded all season, too. I've seen glimpses of us improving. It was an overall good win, especially after last week, we took a bitter loss to Bentworth (48-40)."

As ever, the songsmith doesn't shy away from big issues. Sasha sings about her long-term battle with body dysmorphia on "House With No Mirrors" and ruminates on loss on the gut-wrenching "Until It Happens To You." Here, she addresses the fact that it is impossible to really _understand_ the body blow of losing someone without having experienced it first hand — no matter how much empathy you can muster. What makes it worse it that loss is never too far away. "Somebody loses their somebody every day" just might be the darkest lyric on the album.

       China's domestically developed BeiDou Navigation Satellite System has released platform 2.0, which supports 1.2-meter accuracy and lane level positioning, and experts said that these specifications have endorsed the system's ability to compete in the same ring as GPS.      The information was announced by the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT) recently. Media reported that the BeiDou High Accuracy Positioning Service Platform 2.0 has improved mobile phone positioning accuracy to 1.2 meters for civilian applications.      Based on the BeiDou 2 and BeiDou 3 global satellite navigation systems, the platform can achieve second-level positioning and improve positioning accuracy to 1.2 meters, meaning that lane level positioning can be achieved. The accuracy can reach the sub-meter level when fitted with an on-board antenna.      Realizing lane level positioning means that the navigation system is able to recognize main roads and side roads while being used, Chinese military expert and TV commentator Song Zhongping told the Global Times, noting that GPS is unable to achieve such accuracy.      "The release of version 2.0 of BeiDou's positioning service means that lane level high-precision positioning using mobile phones has entered formal commercial use," CAICT researcher Liu Xu said. "Lane level positioning can be achieved by simply upgrading the firmware and software versions, without the need for additional hardware."      Another difficulty to overcome in order to realize lane level positioning is to shorten the time of navigating. Insiders said that BeiDou's high-precision service 1.0 solved this problem for newer equipment, as it helped store all ephemeris  data needed in positioning, so other equipment would just extract from the high-precision service 1.0, instead of downloading data from satellites.      "It also provides an edge for BeiDou to compete with GPS in the same ring," said Liu.      This improvement is hailed by many netizens, who wonder if it signals the realization of autonomous driving.      However, Song said they are being too optimistic. "Self-driving requires a higher level of accuracy, more to the centimeter level. The navigation system alone is not enough for the car to drive by itself, it also needs sensors and other equipment to steer clear of obstacles."      Song said the achievement is still a big advance, meaning that the navigation system's accuracy has improved from the previous decameter level to the meter level.      On July 31, China's BeiDou III global satellite navigation system was fully completed, opening up high-quality services to the world and allowing ordinary users to use BeiDou's high-precision positioning through their mobile phones.      Apple's latest iPhone 12 series and the new iPhone 11/XR and iPad Pro cellular versions have added support for BeiDou navigation and positioning system services, reports said.

       Despite the bias and questioning from some foreign media over TCM and its effectiveness in treating the disease, it is still receiving rising recognition in many countries and regions worldwide.      Lianhua Qingwen capsule has been licensed in more than 10 countries and regions including Canada, Indonesia, Brazil and Romania, and has started its registration work in more than 30 countries around the world, according to the company.      Demand for TCM in Italy and other infected countries surged in June, as different from Western medicine that initiates treatment when patients get confirmed by a test, TCM therapies offer treatment based on symptoms not only for confirmed but also suspected cases.      In August, Shanghai Cooperation Organization Secretary General Vladimir Norov delivered a special award to a TCM producer Shijiazhuang Yiling Pharmaceutical Co for its contribution to the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in SCO member states, marking a growing recognition of the TCM and its role in treating the disease not only in China but also overseas.

Hay hoy organizaciones que desde España dicen querer empoderar a la mujer africana, y promotoras de la denominada salud reproductiva, promotora del aborto.

First Michigan's governor, then Virginia's, and now, the mayor of Kansas' largest city.

In the case of Wichita Mayor Brandon Whipple, the threats against him, sent via text message to a third party who reported them to police, spelled out a gruesome fate. The "very descriptive plan of execution," Whipple said Saturday, included tracking him down and cutting his throat, then hanging him and "turning him into fertilizer," per the _New York Times_. Whipple tells CNN that the person who sent the messages expressed anger over having to wear face masks, and "anger over ... just COVID in general." Whipple had instituted a citywide face-covering mandate in July.
