Days before the close of the 2012 London Olympics, banners appeared around the city bearing the logo of the soon-to-follow Paralympic Games and proclaiming, “Thanks for the warm-up.” That cheeky, irreverent attitude permeates the new Netflix documentary “Rising Phoenix,” written and directed by Ian Bonhôte and Peter Ettedgui.


  The film, which spans from the celebratory London games to the imperiled 2016 Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro, profiles nine elite athletes (each of whose stories could merit its own documentary) and looks back to chronicle the games' fascinating evolution. Started by Dr. Ludwig Guttmann, a neurologist, as a one-day event for wounded British soldiers at Stoke Mandeville Hospital to coincide with the 1948 London Olympics, the games gained momentum with the first official staging in Rome in 1960.

"It is clear that we did not sustain and suffer the absolute catastrophic damage that we thought was likely based on the forecast we had last night, but we have sustained a tremendous amount of damage," Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said of Hurricane Laura as it was downgraded to a Tropical Storm early Thursday afternoon, nearly 12 hours after making landfall.

He called it the most powerful hurricane to strike Louisiana, meaning it surpassed even Katrina, which was a Category 3 storm when it hit in 2005.


  The hurricane’s top wind speed of 150 mph put it among the most powerful systems on record in the U.S. Not until 11 hours after landfall did Laura finally weaken into a tropical storm as it plowed north and thrashed Arkansas with powerful winds and heavy rain.


  The storm came ashore in low-lying Louisiana and clobbered Lake Charles, an industrial and casino city of 80,000 people. On Broad Street, many buildings had partially collapsed, and those didn’t were missing chunks. Windows were blown out, awnings ripped away and trees split in half. Police spotted a floating casino that came unmoored and hit a bridge.


  “It looks like 1,000 tornadoes went through here. It’s just destruction everywhere,” said Brett Geymann, who rode out the storm with three family members in Moss Bluff, near Lake Charles. He described Laura passing over his house with the roar of a jet engine around 2 a.m.


  “There are houses that are totally gone. They were there yesterday, but now gone,” he said.


  Not long after daybreak offered the first glimpse of the destruction, a massive plume of smoke visible for miles began rising from a chemical plant. Police said the leak was at a facility run by Biolab, which manufactures chemicals used in household cleaners such as Comet bleach scrub and chlorine powder for pools.


  Nearby residents were told to close their doors and windows and turn off air conditioners.


  The fatalities included a 14-year-old girl and a 68-year-old man died when trees fell on their homes in Louisiana, authorities said. No deaths had been confirmed in Texas, which Republican Gov. Greg Abbott said would amount to “a miracle.” President Donald Trump said he would visit the Gulf Coast this weekend to tour the damage.

“We were putting pressure on them to do that with a 4-3-3 system, so we recognised that, put two up top, released our eights in midfield to go a bit higher, and it worked well.


  “It was really pleasing to see all three forwards score and hopefully we can kick on from here.”


  Glentoran boss Mick McDermott felt the outcome was harsh, with Robbie McDaid’s stoppage-time penalty scant reward for their performance.


  “The two yellow cards (for Clucas) had a massive impact,” McDermott said. “The scoreline was harsh but that’s the realities of football.


  “The first one, when I asked the fourth official, he said it was the intensity he hit the ball. I didn’t realise there was a rule against how hard you tackle. The second one he was reaching for the ball and the referee decided it was another yellow. Those moments turn games.


  “We created a couple of chances even after we went down to 10 men and I thought we created the best chances in the first half as well. That game could have gone either way, but the defining moment obviously is the red card.”

Excitement for release of Zack Snyder's _Justice League_ is at an all-time high, even though it won't be premiering on HBO Max anytime soon. But after the buzz of DC FanDome this weekend, where fans were treated to the first official trailer for the 4-part miniseries releasing in 2021, there was a lot of buzz about the project. There's even a rumor about a leaked release date according to an "official" title card released by Warner Bros. which indicated that _Justice League_ would hit HBO Max in September 2021. But now DC and Warner Bros. has made it clear that is not the case.


  The studio confirmed _Justice League_ press materials were erroneously released with the September 2021 release date, but right now the company's official stance is that Zack Snyder's _Justice League_ 4-episode series does not yet have a targeted date on the calendar.


  It will be a while before fans can finally see _Justice League_ as Snyder intended, but fans got their first glimpse of his vision along with the debut of Superman's black suit.


  There's still a lot of work to be done before Snyder's _Justice League_ is ready for HBO Max, but the filmmaker confirmed they had to do some post- production work for Superman's darker costume.


  "At the time, the studio said there was no chance because I was arguing for the black suit the entire time and they were like, 'We don't think it's a good idea,'" explained Snyder.


  2comments


  "I'd say, 'What do you mean?' We would always about...eventually we were like 'Fine. Don't worry about it, we're good.' We said we'll shoot the suit the way it was, but we had done little adjustments to the suit that would make it a little easier to dial it and contrast it a little more because we had done some experiments in Photoshop, so we knew how to do it," Snyder added. "We had done a bunch of private experiments to make sure we could switch it on the DL since frankly, they just weren't into it. I thought from the beginning it was a great idea because it was the correct evolution for him when he rose from the dead, he'd have the black suit. It just made sense."


  Fans will get to see Zack Snyder's _Justice League_ when the film premieres on HBO Max some time in 2021.

Somehow, that welcome sign outside the Lake Berryessa senior center was still standing on Tuesday as residents trickled back through police barricades and road closures to check out what little had survived.


  Three people were killed — one of them a 71-year-old man in a wheelchair — when flames swarmed their mountainside property. Family members said they had tried to escape, but as a last resort took refuge in a homemade “burn shelter.” Relatives identified the victims as Mary Hintemeyer, 70, her boyfriend, Leo McDermott, 71, and McDermott’s 41-year-old son, Tom.


  Much of the lakefront community of retirees and young families who commute to landscaping, winery and service jobs in wealthier corners of Napa County had been reduced to a thicket of tangled steel and ash.


  Now, as people in this community of 1,700 salvaged chipped tea saucers and wooden lanterns from the char of about 100 destroyed homes, their worries were a microcosm of the question haunting so many people during this season of pandemic and strife: Would they ever get their old lives back?


  “We’ve lost so many people who won’t be back,” said Jerry Rehmke, 80, who runs the country store with his wife, Marcia Ritz, 77. Her trailer home, with all of the drawings and paintings she had made, burned in the Spanish Flat Villa mobile home park, along with Vollmer’s trailer and about 50 others.


  “Everything,” Ritz said. “It’s down to the ground.”


  The constellation of wildfires staining California’s skies and stinging people’s lungs across the West have now killed seven and destroyed at least 1,690 homes and other buildings, officials said. It is still early in a wildfire season expected to rage through the fall. So as 15,000 firefighters pushed to gain control of the blazes around the state, thousands of families who evacuated are now streaming back and wondering whether they will have to flee again.


  On Wednesday, Gov. Gavin Newsom said the accounting of death and damage could rise as people return home. “We’ve never seen fire of this scale in this part of the state,” he said. “It demonstrates the reality — not just the point of view — of climate change and its impact in this state.”

The retirement of Laplante, who has decades of experience working in law enforcement in Massachusetts and northern Vermont, came as no surprise; when he came on board five years ago he said he would only work for half a decade.

  “As far as I know there’s only been one so far,” Keith said, and that individual’s interview was postponed from earlier this week.


  Providing police coverage with a depleted roster is nothing new to Keith and his department — they’re regularly at nine officers when someone is out injured or on vacation — but almost two months of working with a nine-man roster is putting a serious dent in the department’s overtime budget, very early into the new budget year, which began July 1.


  Keith said he typically budgets roughly $100,000 for overtime; last year the department slightly exceeded the budget, and “at this rate I expect to go over again. The overtime is up there pretty good, we’re having to back-fill several shifts.


  Keith has faced far worse overtime situations. There were stretches 10 years ago when two of the department’s officers were both deployed overseas at the same time.

Several Texas cities issue mandatory evacuation orders as Hurricane Laura strengthens in the Gulf


   


  The mayor of Galveston called for a mandatory evacuation of the city Tuesday morning after Tropical Storm Laura strengthened into a hurricane and its path shifted westward, increasing the chances that it could strike the Houston area.


   


  Galveston residents have until Wednesday morning to evacuate, but city services will be suspended Tuesday at noon, according to a city Facebook post.


   


  "With the uncertainties of this storm and its increasing strength, we need to take all necessary precautions to protect our residents," Mayor Pro Tem Craig Brown said in a written statement. "It's imperative that you make plans this morning to secure your homes and move you and your family to safety off island."


   


  Further up the Texas coast, residents of Jefferson County, Orange County and the city of Port Arthur also are under a mandatory evacuation order, a local news station reported. Voluntary evacuation orders are in place for Chambers County, Galveston County and the city of Seabrook.


   


  The hurricane, which is expected to strike somewhere along the Texas or Louisiana coast sometime late Wednesday or early Thursday, is forecast to turn into a major Category 3 storm or higher at landfall, according to The Weather Channel. Category 3 hurricanes have wind speeds between 111 and 129 miles per hour.


   


  Laura is bearing down as the coronavirus pandemic remains a major concern in Texas, especially in cities like Houston. The state has averaged about 200 new COVID-19 deaths per day in August.


   


  On Sunday, Gov. Greg Abbott declared a state of disaster for 23 counties and requested federal assistance in anticipation of two impending hurricanes, Laura and Marco. By the time it made landfall Monday near the mouth of the Mississippi River, Hurricane Marco had weakened into a tropical depression, bringing heavy rainfall and gusty winds, The National Hurricane Center said.


   


  Laura could become the second significant storm to impact Texas during the 2020 hurricane season. In Late July, Hurricane Hanna dumped more than 15 inches of rain on South Texas at the same time the region became one of the nation's biggest coronavirus hot spots.


   


  This week marks three years since Hurricane Harvey made landfall near Rockport as a Category 4 storm, then inundated Houston with 50 inches of rain, flooding thousands of homes and killing more than 80 people.

A fire burned a vacant house in Blanket Tuesday morning and damaged a car parked at a neighboring house, bringing a response from four fire departments, Brown County Precinct 3 and others who helped behind the scenes.


   


  That was the description provided by Blanket City Secretary Rose Wigham, who said the fire burned the vacant home at 701 Ave. H, next to the Blanket school district. The fire also jumped to a yard across the street, where it was extinguished with a garden hose while firefighters concentrated on protecting the house at 703 Ave. H, Wigham said. That is the house next to the vacant house and where the car burned, she said.


   


  Blanket Fire Chief Robert Rodgers said the house at 703 Ave. H might have sustained some minor damage such as melted siding, but firefighters saw no major damage.


   


  Fire departments from Blanket, Zephr, Early and Brownwood responded, Rodgers said.


   


  Blanket Mayor B.J. McGinnis turned on additional water wells to make sure firefighters had adequate water pressure, Wigham said. She said the mayor coordinated the water flow to firefighters and was "very instrumental in keeping water flowing."


   


  The man who owns the vacant house had been keeping electricity turned on at the structure so he could come work on the house, Wigham said. She said the same man owns the house at 703 Ave. H, which is a rental house.


   


  "It was amazing how the firefighters got out there," Wigham said. "Precinct 3 was out there with a tanker. They were good. When there's a fire, they swarm from all different angles and swoop in on it. It all happened so fast."


   


  Blanket City Council member Dominique Suentzenich was on the scene and helped the woman who lives at 703 Ave. H get her animals out of the yard, Wigham said.


   


  Wigham estimated that the fire began around 9:15 a.m. She said via text she understands someone heard "a loud pop/explosion in the attic" of the vacant house just before the fire began.


   


  She said McGinnis was at the Blanket City Hall Tuesday morning when McGinnis stepped outside and saw the smoke. McGinnis told her there was "smoke out by the school," Wigham said.


   


  She said McGinnis told her he was impressed at the number of vehicles -- some of them fire trucks, others private vehicles driven by firefighters -- that "just came from everywhere."

Their voices have been added to those of parents' groups, who have expressed concerns over large class sizes, poor school ventilation systems and a lack of online options.


  But at Philippe-Labarre, several parents said they felt it was important for their children to regain a school routine, and expressed confidence in the government's plan despite their worries about COVID-19.


  Bridgeo said the isolation brought on by the pandemic had been hard for her children, and said she felt it was important for them to see their friends and classmates. She also praised the school for its efforts to reassure and communicate with parents.


  Her daughter, Eva, said she was excited to be back at school to see her friends and teachers. She said she was ready to follow safety rules, such as "wear a mask, put gel on your hands, distance."


  Hicham Mekkaoui, standing in line with his six and 10-year-old children, seemed less sure.


  "We're a little stressed this morning because it's not easy coming back to school during a pandemic, but we have no choice, we have to respect public health," he said. Mekkaoui said he would have felt more comfortable with more physical distancing in the classroom, but he believes the teachers will do their best.


  Legault's government has said the plan was developed with health and education experts, who agree that attending school is the best thing for children's well-being. Government officials have noted that elementary schools outside Montreal opened in May without a large spike in cases.


  Quebec Education Minister Jean-Francois Roberge told reporters Thursday most teachers and students are excited to be back at school.


  "What I'm told is that it's not yet perfect everywhere of course — because it's new, because we're adapting — but that it's going well," Roberge said.


  For the time being, the education department has banned team sports, among other after school activities, saying students need to remain in their classroom bubbles. But the province said it plans to review those restrictions in a few weeks.


  Teachers' unions have also raised concerns that the pandemic will exacerbate an existing teacher shortage at a time when more resources are needed to deal with the pandemic.


  A spokesman for one union said many teachers have retired early or have been exempted due to medical conditions, leaving Montreal's largest school district missing hundreds of staff members as the year starts up.


  Gendron said that as of Thursday morning, 75 of the school district's 69,000 students had requested an exemption due to a medical condition. He said 379 of 9,000 teachers have also requested to stay home. It was too early, however, to confirm how many parents have chosen to opt for home-schooling, he said.


  This report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 27, 2020.

The video released appears to show Jacob Blake getting shot in the back, while getting into his car, by a policeman with one hand on Jacob's shoulder and his gun in the other. This snapshot alone is a demonstration of improper police procedure. With your hand on the suspect your gun should be holstered lest it go off by mistake. Especially with two other officers on scene, holding guns aimed at the suspect. If Jacob had acted in a manner legally deserving to get shot, he would have been struck in the front by the other two cops. If the bystanders stories hold up, and the forensics match, we will find that the officers, coming to break up a fight, man-handled a good Samaritan instead and shot him by mistake. We have not seen the actual fight Jacob came to break up, but surely some neighbor got video of that. Meanwhile, let's parade and shout but stop throwing rocks, bottles and firebombs.

The Sox had a day game Wednesday, before the Milwaukee Bucks’ wildcat strike ahead of their game against the Orlando Magic, and had a scheduled off day Thursday.


  The Sox are scheduled to have a home game Friday — on what Major League Baseball is promoting as Jackie Robinson Day — against the Kansas City Royals. As of Thursday afternoon, Giolito said the team hadn’t addressed its next steps.


  “I don’t think anything going on is a distraction,” Giolito said. “It’s real life. It’s what’s going on in this country. It’s been kind of weird because (Tuesday), I had a really good game (pitching a no-hitter) and I want to enjoy that and celebrate that. We have been. We had a nice series as well. Our team is playing well, momentum is good.


  “But at the same time, there is a lot going on outside of baseball that is very important. We are going to have to have a discussion on the team and see where everyone’s head is at.”


  Three NBA games were postponed Wednesday, with the Bucks leading the push to protest racial injustice. WNBA players also made powerful statements, Major League Soccer postponed five games, and three baseball games were postponed as part of the movement.


  “I think that it’s a good step,” Giolito said. “Historically, it’s almost as if you wouldn’t expect baseball players to participate in something like that. Usually, it’s, ‘Keep your head down and play the game and do what you do.’ But, and I’m going to sound like a broken record, players are people, too, human beings.


  “I happened to watch the press conference of Mets player Dom Smith, who I know personally, and watching him up there talk about his experience, get emotional, it made me emotional.

Global corn supply outside the United States appears set for expansion in 2020-2021. Total foreign corn production in the World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates report for August came in at 30.8 billion bushels, an increase of 648 million bushels from the previous year. Corn production for major exporters expanded by 330.3 million bushels during the previous marketing year to 8.9 billion bushels. Brazil looks set for a large corn crop. At 4.2 billion bushels, the projection for the Brazilian corn crop encompasses almost half the major exporter production. Argentina is expected to hold corn production at 1.97 billion bushels next marketing year.


  Quite a bit of discussion on export potential focused on the changing fortunes of the dollar recently. The Brazilian real has decreased 39 percent against the dollar since the turn of the year. The Argentinian peso has decreased 23 percent during the same period.


  The dollar is stronger than levels seen in June. But the potential for continued dollar weakness against significant competitors seems limited as we move into 2021 due to various economic issues around the world. It’s too early to assess production potential in South America, but larger crops seem in the offing and hold the potential for changes in U.S. export levels during 2021. Corn exports may reach USDA projections in 2020-2021 but might require reduced prices for that.


  The recent flattening of ethanol-production levels creates some concern for corn demand in the short and long run. The projection of corn used for ethanol production of 5.2 billion bushels for 2020-2021 indicates an increase of 350 million bushels as compared to this marketing year. To meet the current USDA projection, an expansion in gasoline consumption or growth in ethanol export levels is necessary.

“We know that asymptomatic spread is a very real concern and we need everyone who comes into contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19 to get tested,” he said in an email. “I know the President doesn’t believe in science and would like to ignore this pandemic, but it’s the job of our medical institutions to uphold science and provide straightforward public health guidance, not bow to political pressure.”


  In response to the CDC change, the Chicago Department of Public Health immediately issued its own guidance stating that testing is still recommended for those who have been in close contact with an infected person, regardless of symptoms.


  “Right away, like that same morning, we put out guidance that said we continue to see significant transmission here in Chicago, and the Chicago Department of Public Health continues to recommend testing for asymptomatic contacts of anybody diagnosed with COVID-19,” said Dr. Allison Arwady, director of the city’s health department, during a Facebook Live show on Thursday. “That has been our guidance all along, and we were very clear that is locally still the recommendation.”


  The Illinois Department of Public Health is also advising anyone who comes into close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case to be tested.


  “Many individuals who test positive for COVID-19 have not reported having symptoms,” the state health department said in a news release on Thursday. “However, scientific studies have proven that those individuals are still able to spread the disease to family, friends, and members of their community who may become sick and require medical attention and even hospitalization, especially for those with underlying health conditions.”


  After coming under fire, CDC Director Robert R. Redfield issued a statement to some media outlets on Wednesday attempting to clarify the new federal testing advice.


  “Everyone who needs a Covid-19 test, can get a test,” the statement said, according to the New York Times. “Everyone who wants a test does not necessarily need a test; the key is to engage the needed public health community in the decision with the appropriate follow-up action.”


  But as of Thursday afternoon, the revised testing guidelines were still posted on the CDC website.

Republican leaders in the state Senate have already introduced their own plan that addresses some of Wolf and his cabinet’s concerns surrounding what is sure to be an unprecedented election. But the legislation also contains a provision that would tighten the deadline to apply for a mail-in ballot — from seven days to 15 — which a spokesperson for Wolf previously said he opposes.


  Earlier in the week, Wolf said there have been discussions with Republicans about election reform, but the bill introduced by Senate Majority Leader Jake Corman (R., Centre) and President Pro Tempore Joe Scarnati (R., Jefferson) was “not the result of the negotiations.”


  “It’s a first pass and I certainly take it very seriously,” Wolf said.


  Under an election reform package passed by the legislature in 2019, counties can begin processing mail-in ballots at 7 a.m. on Election Day. But counting those ballots can take days, which may lead to delays declaring a winner. For that reason, Wolf is proposing lawmakers extend that timeframe to allow county election boards to begin the process 21 days before the election.


  Such a change was endorsed by the Pennsylvania Department of State in a report reviewing the 2020 primary and by the good-government group Committee of Seventy in a letter to the General Assembly.

  # Letter: Let businesses operate indoors


  Ventura County Star


  Members of the Simi Valley City Council, I am writing this to address an issue causing concerns within our community. Many questions have been raised regarding whether businesses should be allowed to operate outside in this heat with poor air quality, putting the health of many citizens in jeopardy.


  I, as well as other members of our community, strongly disagree with this temporary authorization. Although this was put in place to “accommodate operations at pre-COVID-19 levels,” I feel that it’s only putting people’s health more at risk. If many businesses can operate indoors such as coffee shops, grocery stores, and clothing stores, then why is it that barber shops, nail salons, and even churches are required to operate outside? If barber shops and nail salons were able to operate indoors, masks would still be worn, and business owners have the option of installing plexiglass screens.


  If churches were able to operate indoors, masks would still be implemented as well as the required six-feet social distance. Although these businesses are operating outside in a large open space, that only results in employees working in this crucial heat while breathing in bad air due to all the fires, which puts not only the employees but the customers health more at risk.


  The community of Simi Valley needs to do something about this. We should not sit back and watch people suffer just to make a living; this is not how it should be. We are a community and we must stick together through everything, not sit back and watch people suffer. Businesses should be able to operate indoors as long as CDC guidelines are followed. Think about it, would you want to be outside working under the sun, in the heat, with no air conditioning breathing in your own carbon dioxide?


   _Joy Moore, Simi Valley_

BUFFALO, N.Y. - The Toronto Blue Jays-Boston Red Sox Major League Baseball game on Thursday night has been postponed in the aftermath of the police shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man, in Wisconsin last weekend.


  The Red Sox and Jays put out a joint statement to announce the decision, about 30 minutes before the scheduled first pitch.


  The decision was made after Red Sox outfielder Jackie Bradley Jr., who is Black, said he would not play, according to multiple media reports.


  The Blue Jays and Red Sox played the second game of their three-game series on Wednesday night in Buffalo, N.Y., after the NBA started a string of postponements across all sports just over an hour before first pitch as the Milwaukee Bucks refused to take the court.


  Multiple reports indiciated at least three other Major League Baseball games would not be played Thursday.

To say that _The New Mutants_ has had a complicated path towards release would be an understatement, as it has suffered a number of release date delays over the span of years, with a new report from _Vulture_ claiming that, at one point, Fox was so disappointed with the cut they had seen that they wanted the entire film scrapped so that it could start over. Director Josh Boone, on the other hand, claims that he never helmed any reshoots for the film and that the version that will be landing in theaters is his vision for the adventure, so whatever the studio's desires might have been at the time, it seems like new distributor Disney wasn't as invested in the final product.


   _Vulture_ cites "sources familiar with _New Mutants_ ' production" when noting that the project got the green light to move forward when it was pitched as embracing not just horror elements, but also the lighthearted coming-of-age films of John Hughes. Boone and his writing partner Knate Lee, however, weren't as interested in the more comedic corner of the X-Men universe, and were "reluctant or outright unwilling to implement such script changes requested by the studio, requiring round after round of rewrites and one intervention-like roundtable read just before filming." When the initial cut was screened for Fox, likely back in 2017, the studio was "so displeased with the initial cut the studio discussed throwing the entire movie out to 'start over' with a total reshoot."


  With _The New Mutants_ finally set to land in select theaters on August 28th, it marks the closing of a chapter in the _X-Men_ spinoff's saga, though it surely won't be the last we'll hear of it.


  The film's first trailer landed in the fall of 2017 with an April 2018 release date, but when _X-Men: Dark Phoenix_ was delayed for reshoots, so was _New Mutants_. Various reports emerged about the need for reshoots and what additional footage could consist of, with rumors ranging from the project going full-blown horror with R-rated scenes to the addition of an entirely new CGI character into what was already filmed.


  Boone has largely denied reports of massive tweaks to his film, other than various hints that the project was initially set in the '80s and was since updated.


  Disney's purchase of 20th Century Fox while _New Mutants_ was facing delays didn't help matters much, but once the project is in both the studio's and Boone's rearview, we won't be surprised if more reports about what really led to the various delays ultimately emerge.

After battering the Gulf Coast at about midnight Thursday, Hurricane Laura has been downgraded to a Category 2 storm as it moves away from the Texas- Louisiana border.


   


  About 70,000 Texans are out of power in the East Texas counties of Jefferson, Orange and Hardin, local media reported. The storm moved ashore in Cameron Parish, Louisiana -- which borders Texas -- around midnight Thursday after almost strengthening into a Category 5 storm, according to the National Hurricane Center.


   


  But as the morning wore on, officials in Southeast Texas were sounding optimistic that their corner of the state had escaped the worst of the hurricane's impact.


   


  "I'm very pleased to report the damage to Southeast Texas was minimal. We really dodged a bullet," state Rep. Dade Phelan, a Republican who represents part of Jefferson County and all of neighboring Orange County, tweeted Thursday morning. "Prayers for our friends in the Southwest Louisiana."


   


  In Newton County, by the border with Louisiana, County Judge Kenneth Weeks said that Hurricane Laura knocked down trees, blocking roads and major highways. Some areas received minor flooding and power is out in most of the county as of Thursday morning. Crews are working to clear the roads.


   


  "We got about what we expected and what we geared for," Weeks said. "Our big push right now is to make sure that all of our citizens can get back to their properties safely and assess damage to their homes."


   


  But that optimism came at the same time Gov. Abbott warned Texans not to celebrate too much before officials have a chance to assess the storm's full impact on the area.


   


  "Good news, which is really premature, is that we have no reports of any deaths," he told Good Morning America on Thursday morning. "The storm continues to sweep through Texas in an unprecedented fashion because it's not just where the surge came in. [The storm] is going up north to Jasper and Center, Texas all the way up to Marshall, Texas so in northeast Texas a hurricane is going through there for, as far as I know, the first time ever."


   


  Earlier Abbott told NBC's Today show that search and rescue efforts are currently underway and credited evacuation orders for saving lives.


   


  "This is, unfortunately, not our first rodeo in dealing with something like this. So [search and rescue] get pre-staged, and we are ready to go out as soon as the storm hits… They are out looking for anybody who may need help right now."


   


  Laura's size and strength brought warnings from the hurricane center of "catastrophic" devastation from storm surge and wind damage on both sides of the Texas-Louisiana border.

Anderson has been around for many years, and over the next couple months, he will be back, knocking out some phenomenal players. He is aging, but he does focus, and he just wants to play. He is amongst the players who are addicted to tennis.      Two years ago many people did not know who Tsitsipas was. Well, now, many folks have watched him, and they can see that his punching forehand, his heavy backhand and his high-bouncing serves, can rattle the cage. Tsitsipas does smile, and he can sprint, and touch the lines.      He will play against American John Isner today in the last match. Isner was very thrilled that he could play again at a real tournament. Another guy with a very huge first serve, Isner beat Hubert Hurkacz in straight sets. He has put together some terrific years on hard courts. He recently said that he can go super deep at Western & Southern Open and the US Open. During press conferences, he can be enthusiastic, but when he loses, he was dreadful. Either way, to return to the top 20, he has to be patient and think about his approach in the next few points He has to be thoughtful and try to push Tsitsipas with a lot of variety. It should be a thrilling match.      Belgian David Goffin had a solid day, beating the grinder Borna Coric in two tough sets. Goffin has a lot of variety. To reach the top 10, he must swing harder. Neither Rafa Nadal and Roger Federer are here, so in this tournament, there are a solid 10 guys who can win this title. It’s a long way to go but the winner can jump in the ocean and celebrate.

Since Seth Whiting was hired as head football coach, Alliance has gradually built a winning culture.  


  Under Whiting, the Aviators have gone 28-15 the last four years, qualified for postseason play the last three seasons and claimed three straight conference championships, going undefeated in the league all three seasons.  


  "Our goal was to become a football program with sustained success," Whiting said. "We think we've raised the expectations from our kids and community, but we want to keep building on it."  


  Heading into his fifth season as Alliance head coach, Whiting believes his current team has a different identity than any of his four previous squads.  


  "We feel we have great depth," he said. "We think we're two-deep at every position."  


  Alliance, which finished 7-4 overall and 6-0 against Eastern Buckeye Conference competition in 2019, returns to Division III after a one-year stay in Division II and a competitive region featuring Massillon, Akron Hoban and Perry. However, the return to Division III won't make it easier for the Aviators, even though they don't have to worry about qualifying for the playoffs this year after the state approved an open postseason tournament.  


  "There excellent teams in Division III, especially in our region," Whiting said. "There also is quality depth."  


  When it comes to position depth, Alliance is loaded at quarterback, with two returning starters and a talented young prospect. Seniors Brandon Alexander (6-3, 220) and Braidyn Hartsoe (6-1, 190) split time taking snaps last season. Both were dual threats. Alexander, who gave a verbal commitment to Youngstown State this summer, was 59 of 113 passing (52%) for 671 yards and five touchdowns, and he added 468 rushing yards (4.3 avg.) and two scores. Hartsoe, who was inserted as the starter after Alexander was injured in the sixth game at Canton South, was also productive, finishing 43 of 69 (62%) for 964 yards with eight touchdowns, and he added 200 rushing yards and four scores. In addition to the two veterans, freshman Brendan Zurbrugg (6-2, 165) adds depth at quarterback.  


  While the quarterback spot is led by two veterans, the running back spot is loaded with sophomores, headed by Kayden Davis (6-2, 190), Ex'Ziriaun Williamson (5-9, 140) and Jaxson Cooper (5-10, 165). Junior Marqwayil Greer (5-9, 190) also is in the mix for playing time.  


  "We're a spread team that wants to be able to run and throw the football, but we want to be a run-first team, so we need good backs," Whiting said.  


  Complementing the offensive backs are the receivers, headed by senior tight end Andrew Datz (6-2, 240) and senior wide receiver Dylan Bugara (5-7, 150). Datz, who also has given a look at running back, was a playmaker last season, finishing with 14 receptions for 329 yards (23.5 avg.) and four touchdowns. Bugara, who possesses good speed, added eight catches for 131 yards (16.4 avg.) and also averaged 13 yards on three carries. Seniors Tre Hawkins (5-11, 200) and Jhon Howard (5-9, 165), junior Jordan Simms (6-1, 190), and sophomores Carter Bugara (5-9, 165) and Ovie Jones (5-8, 150) are the other wideouts. Alexander looked comfortable at wideout after returning late in the regular season and is another candidate. Junior Tyriq Mason (5-9, 170) brings depth to tight end.  


  During Whiting's time as head coach, he favors rotating offensive linemen and Alliance has both the personnel and depth to continue that philosophy. The tackles are senior Blayne Reith (6-2, 210) and junior Thomas Butt (5-10, 210), two returners. Senior Cody Thompson (5-10, 255), another veteran, moves to center. Senior Markell Davis (6-1, 300), junior Jahkai Martin (5-11, 260) and senior Rico Curry (6-2, 275) are good-sized guards which could make the zone running game sparkle. The other two offensive linemen in the rotation are senior Kyle Daniel (5-10, 200) and junior Hunter Berlin (6-0, 200).  


  Many of the offensive starters are projected to play on defense, which is a 3-4 base with multiple looks.  


  Datz, who accrued 44 tackles, six tackles for loss and 1 ½ sacks, returns at one end, with Daniel, Reith and Berlin at the other end. Markell Davis, a returner, and Curry, are the top two nose tackles.  


  Howard, who is solid run stopper and is versatile and quick enough to rush the quarterback or drop in coverage on pass plays, returns at outside linebacker. Senior Dewayne Davis (6-4, 190) will get the nod at the other outside linebacker spot. Hartsoe, an impact player with 90 tackles, 12 tackles for loss, six sacks and two interceptions, and Martin are active inside linebackers, with Greer, Mason and senior Corey Prendergast (5-11, 205) supplying depth.  


  Dylan Bugara, who registered 42 tackles and three interceptions, returns at cornerback. Jones and senior Jabril Gilmore (5-9, 140) are vying for the other starting cornerback spot. Senior Grant McGeehan (6-0, 165), another veteran, is back at safety. Kayden Davis, Alexander and Carter Bugara are the prominent candidates to join McGeehan at safety.  


  "Our defensive [mentality] is the same," Whiting said. "We want to be aggressive, yet disciplined."  


  Dylan Bugara returns at punter and return specialist. He averaged 39.1 as a punter on 25 attempts, and averaged 15 yards as a kickoff returner and 13 yards as a punt return specialist. Carter Bugara and Zurbrugg are two candidates for the vacated placekicking spot.  


  "We've had a good summer," Whiting said. "We're taking things day by day, getting ready for the season, and controlling the things we can control."

Any pandemic, in any historical period, would benefit from a Bill & Tedmovie. “Bill & Ted Face the Music” makes that clear enough. It opens in theaters and online this weekend. While it’s adequate at best in its screen comedy technique, its heart is supremely generous. And its unfashionably persistent belief in the value of “being excellent to each other” goes down especially well in 2020, when so many have forgotten that one.


  First things first: Keanu Reeves. He and his less-starry costar Alex Winter, as the San Dimas, Calif. friends for life, are now in their mid-50s. Now married (to their medieval princesses) with young adult daughters seriously into music, the duo isn’t a middle-aged extension of the duo introduced in “Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure” (1989) and “Bill & Ted’s Bogus Journey” (1991). They’re pretty much _exactly_ the same guys, although Reeves — with jet-black hair, chalky-white features and an air of karaoke reluctance — seems to have re-learned the character from a Kabuki theater master.

  # Janoris Jenkins feels great heading into Year 2 with Saints. 'Oh man, we're stacked'


  By Luke Johnson


  The Times-Picayune (New Orleans)


  Imagine what Janoris "Jackrabbit" Jenkins could be in a New Orleans Saints uniform when he actually understands exactly what is going on around him -- when he knows where his help is supposed to be on a given play, when he has a feel for his teammates' subtleties.


  All of that he believes will help him play fast; faster than he did after joining the Saints in 2019, when he was thrust into the fire during the stretch run. New Orleans acquired him off waivers December 17, Jenkins played his first game three days before Christmas and then played 141 of a possible 149 defensive snaps in the regular season finale and playoffs.


  Those few weeks were tough, but they were critical, "a huge advantage," Jenkins says now. The crash course gave him some frame of reference this offseason when it comes to understanding the Saints defensive framework and his place within it.


  And the early returns are encouraging. Coach Sean Payton said he has liked Jenkins' performance in training camp so far.


  "He's a player with very good instincts," Payton said. "He's a player that is a good tackler. He can turn the ball over; I like his ball skills. ... And that's been a big plus for us to get another quality corner in our program."


  It is a big plus, particularly because of who lines up on the opposite side of the field as Jenkins.


  Well before he arrived in New Orleans, Jenkins already owned a reputation as one of the NFL's premier cover corners. His 23 career interceptions -- including an NFL-high five last season -- rank T-15th among active players. Now, he gets to work in tandem with a rising star in Marshon Lattimore.


  "Oh man," Jenkins said, "we're stacked."


  "We feel like we got two of the better cover corners in the league," defensive coordinator Dennis Allen said. "They're different in that Marshon's a little bit of a bigger, physical type of corner; Jackrabbit's going to use his speed and his quickness a little bit more."


  In his ideal scenario, Jenkins said he is playing in a defense that allows him to use his quickness, agility and aggressiveness in press coverage.


  That aligns both secondary coach Aaron Glenn's vision of Jenkins' strength, and also the way the Saints want to play defense.


  "We have the ability to play a lot of press man coverage with both (Jenkins and Lattimore)," Glenn said. "They do a really good job of working off of each other."


  That last bit is a part of solid cornerback play that Glenn believes is often taken for granted.


  The Saints' secondary coach spent 15 years as an NFL defensive back. The good corner tandems have a sort of unspoken communication between them, a sort of intuitive interplay. It's understanding where the other is supposed to be, it's the shared look and mutual understanding about how to respond to a specific situation.


  There was a bit of a flying-by-the-seat-of-their-pants element to that sort of advanced communication late last year. Not as much now, and it's only getting better.


  "That takes reps," Glenn said. "With him being with us to get it has been outstanding. He is an outstanding player.


  "You see the bounce in his step. I think he's very happy to be here. That has a lot to do with the way he's operating right now."

DNA testing of the samples confirmed what DuBoise had long said: that he was not responsible for the rape and murder of the woman, Barbara Grams, 19, prosecutors said.


  On Wednesday, prosecutors said they had moved to free DuBoise by filing a joint motion with his lawyer to reduce his life sentence to time served. If a judge approves the motion Thursday, DuBoise could walk out of Hardee Correctional Institution in Bowling Green, Florida, on Thursday afternoon, after 37 years behind bars.

Flu activity typically peaks between December and February, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), but flu activity can last as late as May. Experts are warning of a “twindemic,” or the overlap of flu season and COVID-19 when hospitals and medical professionals can be overwhelmed with sick people.

En su discurso de esta noche, Trump tiene la intención de hablar de los disturbios raciales en Kenosha (Wisconsin), después de que un hombre de raza negra recibiera siete disparos en la espalda de un policía blanco el domingo pasado.                                                                                                                                                                                         Trump 'hablará de los disturbios que hemos visto en ciudades estadounidenses, incluida Kenosha, Mineápolis, Portland, Seattle, Chicago y otras urbes', avanzó el director de Comunicaciones de la campaña del mandatario, Tim Murtaugh, a los periodistas.                                                                                                                                                                                         'Hará referencia a Kenosha -agregó-, y hablará sobre el tema en términos de que la reacción no puede ser una escalada de la violencia, y no podemos tener estadounidenses que continúen dañando a estadounidenses en nuestras calles'.                                                                                                                                                                                         Asimismo, el responsable de la campaña adelantó que el mandatario mencionará también la necesidad de que la Policía pueda hacer su trabajo y expresará su respeto por la labor desempeñada 'por la amplia mayoría' de los agentes.                                                                                                                                                                                         El Servicio de Parques Nacionales ha dado autorización al Comité Nacional Republicano para que se lancen fuegos artificiales a partir de las 23.00 horas local (03.00 hora GMT) en el Mall, la explanada de museos y monumentos que une la Casa Blanca con el Capitolio, después de que el presidente acepte la nominación del partido.                                                                                                                                                                                         Mañana, viernes, se espera que miles se congreguen frente al Monumento a Lincoln, en la capital, para conmemorar la Marcha sobre Washington de 1963, durante la cual el líder de los derechos civiles Martin Luther King pronunció su famoso discurso 'Tengo un sueño'.                                                                                                                                                                                         Desde finales de mayo, las protestas raciales se han reavivado en EE.UU. tras la muerte de un afroamericano, George Floyd, a manos de un policía blanco en Mineápolis (Minesota).

For the uninitiated, Sam and Max first made their debut in a series of comics created by Steve Purcell in 1987. The characters are a pair of private investigators that take on a number of bizarre cases. In 1993, LucasArts published _Sam and Max: Hit the Road_ , a point-and-click adventure on PC that is often considered one of the greatest games of all-time. Following the success of _Hit the Road_ , Sam and Max briefly starred in a cartoon on Fox Kids in the 90s, as well as a series of adventure games published by Telltale in the 2000s. The last of those released back in 2010; after more than a decade, the characters will finally return!


  It will be interesting to see how fans react to Sam and Max's return. While the characters have maintained a faithful following since their debut, VR gaming tends to be rather niche. The costs associated tend to be fairly prohibitive, and many gamers find the equipment to be nausea-inducing. Since this new game also seems to be in a very different style from _Hit the Road_ , longtime fans might be less enthused. Of course, VR does offer more immersive experiences, and a Sam and Max game could take great advantage of that.


  Either way, developer Happy Giant seems to have its work cut out for it! As of this writing, specific platforms have yet to be revealed. Until more information is revealed, fans will just have to be happy with the brief teaser that was released.


  Are you excited for the return of Sam and Max? Are you a fan of the characters? Let us know in the comments or share your thoughts directly on Twitter at @Marcdachamp to talk about all things gaming!

"It may not be now, but there could be a plan," he said. "I'm not promising anything. But there could be a plan as far as just standing up and doing what's right. Because at the end of the day, that's all that matters. Human life is the most important thing. We have to value that. There is no clear cut other way but to do the right things."

Under the legislation, voters would be able to turn in ballots at polling places, county election board offices, or county courthouses. Language in the bill would effectively prohibit the use of satellite drop boxes, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer, which are also the subject of a Trump administration lawsuit against the state.


  There are areas of agreement between Wolf and GOP leaders in the Senate. Both sides support moving the deadline for counties to begin mailing out ballots to 28 days before an election, instead of the current requirement of 14 days.


  And there’s consensus that voters should be able to serve as poll workers anywhere within their county, not just at their home precinct.


  Republicans in the state House, who will return to Harrisburg soon, said there’s “agreement that changes must be made to our Election Code following the primary.” A spokesperson for the caucus said lawmakers will consider legislation that “provides more options to voters to cast their ballots, enhances the security of the voting process, and maintains the integrity of our elections while ensuring accurate results are reported in a timely manner.”

“Each student can have a dedicated device in order to avoid sharing,” Lamoille North Business Manager Deb Clark said. Those devices can be used during remote learning but also in school, and hopefully cut down on the potential spread of COVID-19.


  “It’s not necessarily so kids can take them all home,” Clark said. “They may be able to take them home on their remote days, but it’s mostly so they’re not sharing,” while in the same buildings.


  Plans to put a portable computer into the hands of each student in the district were in the works before the pandemic, but remote learning last spring, coupled with plans for a hybrid model this fall where kids will switch off being in school and being at home, accelerated the process.


  The money is being drawn from a few different emergency relief funds, Clark said. The money will come from elementary and secondary school emergency relief accounts, coronavirus relief funds and school improvement grants.


  The district still had roughly $500,000 in emergency relief funding available before approving the purchase of new learning devices last week.

Yet McConnell faces his own difficulties because many, if not most, GOP senators appear satisfied, for now, that there remains enough existing aid available and new money is not needed. The split in his ranks gives Pelosi an upper hand in talks because she has been able to bring most of her Democrats on board with her proposals.

“This agreement represents a compromise to avoid further litigation,” the settlement agreement states. “By making this agreement, no party makes any admission concerning the strength or weakness of any claim.”


  Bain was awarded $150,000 in damages by the jury last September, and Judge Geoffrey Crawford awarded him an additional $175,000 in legal fees. He settled Monday for $70,000 less, and waived his right to any legal action against Wrend and other Lamoille South officials for any reason “which he ever had, now has, or may have.”


  The settlement will be paid out of the Vermont School Boards Insurance Trust, a pool established by the Vermont School Boards Association that all public school districts can dip into. It covers lawsuits as well as things like worker’s compensation and property damage.


  The settlement happened before the case in New York’s Second Circuit Court of Appeals could really get off the ground. Wrend appealed the verdict June 29.


  Wrend’s lawyer, Sean Toohey, said one of the early steps in the appeal process was a court-ordered mediation session. That’s where the settlement occurred.


  Toohey said the appeal concerned “several legal errors that resulted in an unsustainable jury verdict.”
