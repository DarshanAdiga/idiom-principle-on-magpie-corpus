DARTMOUTH -- Cancellation of all its major fundraiser events due to the coronavirus, forced the Humane Society & Shelter SouthCoast to go out and apply for a disaster assistance loan from the Small Business Administration.
 The low-interest loans were made available by the SBA for businesses and non- profits that suffered substantial economic injury due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 "All of our fundraising events had to be cancelled," said Melina Ventura, executive director of the shelter. The upcoming "Give Me Shelter" Gala Fundraising Event that would have happened next month has been canceled, due to the pandemic. That fundraiser alone typically brings in some $45,000 in donations, Ventura said.
 "There's no way we could have held the event and keep with social distancing," she said. "Businesses are so generous, but how do you ask a business like a restaurant to donate?" she asked, knowing they are struggling financially during the coronavirus crisis.
 However, Ventura was staring down at a leaky roof and dog kennels that needed to be redone and had to make the choice and apply for a loan to cover the renovation expense.
 "This building is over 20 years old. The roof couldn't wait," she said.
 The shelter's 48 indoor/outdoor kennel dog runs are also being refurbished starting in November. Ventura explained that constant cleaning of the runs with disinfecting chemicals takes its toll on the flooring over the years.
 The roof replacement, Ventura said, is complete except for the cupola that was removed for repairs. The kennel runs should take a couple of weeks.
 The total cost of the project, she said, is around $149,000.
 The shelter is a holding facility for animals coming from Dartmouth and Marion. It takes overflows of animals from New Bedford, Fairhaven, and Fall River. It also serves as a state-approved quarantine facility taking animals mostly from southern states where animal overpopulation is high, Ventura said.
 Another popular summer program that had to be put on hiatus because of the pandemic, Ventura said, was the Shelter Buddie Kids Club.
 "We couldn't put the kids in jeopardy," Ventura said, noting it would have been difficult to run the program with social distancing rules. The four- session summer program teaches children ages 6 to 11 about all forms of animal care. "Hopefully by next summer the program will be back," she said.
 The shelter is open to the public for adoptions, Ventura said. It's also still delivering donated pet food to senior citizens who cannot get out to purchase food for their pet.
 Ventura said the shelter plans to go ahead with its Christmas fundraiser, which is a direct mailing way to secure donations.
 The next in-person fundraiser happens in the spring during its Easter Basket giveaway event. However, Ventura said she doesn't know what coronavirus restrictions might still be in place then, leaving plans for that fundraiser up in the air.
 Anyone can donate to the shelter at its website, by mailing a check, or calling the main office at 508-995-6661 with a credit card donation.

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — The Florida Supreme court dismissed a lawsuit on Wednesday that sought to nullify a proposed constitutional amendment that would open primaries to all voters regardless of party affiliation. While the Supreme Court approved Question 3 for the ballot in December, the lawsuit claimed new studies since then show the proposed amendment would hurt minority representation in government. The lawsuit was filed Oct. 13, when about 2 million votes had already been cast for the Nov. 3 election. It asked justices to order elections officials not to count ballots cast on the question. The ballot question would style Florida elections similar to those in California. In Florida, all candidates for the state Legislature, Cabinet and governor would appear on the same primary ballot and then the top two candidates would move on to the general election. That could mean two Democrats or two Republicans face each other in the general election. The group All Voters Vote gathered petitions to put the proposal on the ballot. It would need 60% approval to pass.

Creating your own Christmas traditions or Hanukkah traditions is a wonderful way to make the holidays even more special. If you don't already have customs that you do every year with your family, get inspired by the unique ways _Real Simple_ readers ring in the holidays, from Hanukkah to Christmas to New Year's Eve.      Since we moved to Virginia four years ago, my husband and I have attended the annual National Menorah Lighting on the Ellipse, in Washington, D.C. A military band accompanies three cantors while they give the blessing and sing, and latkes and sufganiyot (a type of doughnut often enjoyed on Hanukkah) are served. Afterward we go to our favorite Mediterranean restaurant. I am pregnant with twins due this month, and I can't wait to share this tradition with them.    _-- Cyndi Alderson, Oak Hill, Virginia_      When my two siblings and I were very young, our nana started the tradition of hiding a small plastic bird in our Christmas tree (it was notable for the Band-Aid on its left leg, courtesy of a run-in with the family dog). The three of us would search high and low to find the bird, which was supposed to bring the finder luck in the coming year. Once we were adults, our mom wanted us to continue the ritual with our own families, so she gave each of us a replica of a red cardinal. And ever since we've enjoyed watching the next generation search for these birds.    _-- Beth Britton, New York, New York_      A marshmallow fight. It always happens after dinner on Christmas Eve, and usually one of my cousins starts it. Everyone joins in, from the toddlers to the grandparents, until someone waves the white flag.    _-- Jessica P. Sanchez, La Mirada, California_      During Hanukkah, we do a Yankee swap, a gift exchange. It has always been great fun, but a few years ago my husband and I decided to make it even more interesting by sneaking decoy gifts into the mix. They look like normal presents from the outside--we wrap up things like CD cases, gift-card envelopes, and wine bottles--but once you look inside, you see that the original item has been replaced with a note card bearing an instruction, such as "Switch gifts with a person of the opposite gender" or "Choose a new gift-- and no one can take it from you." This little twist was a surprise to everyone the first year, but now it is our favorite part of the ritual.    _-- Christine Gritmon, Pearl River, New York_      Every December, my friends and I visit a nearby resort that hosts a holiday gnome hunt. Twenty of these white-bearded men, which range from 6 to 12 inches tall, are hidden throughout a giant atrium. Our group of 12 splits into teams of three, and we give ourselves a two-hour time limit to scavenge for the gnomes. The folks who find the largest number of them win free ice cream or hot chocolate, depending on the weather that night.    _-- Alicia Carby, Orlando, Florida_      While we decorate the tree, our family devours a spread of doughnuts and Champagne. We always save the wire cage from the top of the bottle, write the year underneath the cap with a permanent marker, then affix the cage to a high branch. My husband and I have done this since we got married, nearly three decades ago, so this year there will be 27 Champagne cages adorning our tree. They are unusual, to say the least, and add a fun pop of color.    _-- Evelyn Cucchiara, Madison, New Jersey_      One tradition that my clan adopted from our hometown of Maracaibo, Venezuela-- in fact, it's common in several Latin American countries--is to wear a new pair of yellow underpants on New Year's Eve and into the following day. It's supposed to bring good luck. My husband, who is American, was amused to hear of this custom when I told him about it back in 2006. Later that same day, he came home with two pairs of underwear: Mine were simply yellow, but he could find only a pair of SpongeBob Square-pants boxers for himself. Two pairs of lucky underwear now top our holiday shopping lists every year.    _-- Natalia Gustafson, Baton Rouge, Louisiana_

The outbreak of coronavirus has affected the lives of the people to the maximum possible extent. This is because of the reason that the medical industry is not equipped with the vaccine to cure the patients who are being treated with. In addition, the most important consideration, for the time being, involves the point that the people who are already suffering from serious health ailments are likely to get more affected by the spread of the novel coronavirus. Therefore, an attempt is made to ensure that the patients who are already suffering from diabetes and foot problems are likely to report an increase in the incidence of suffering due to the depleting health conditions. The studies highlighted that they are facing problems including indigestion. Therefore, the most important consideration in this respect is that the proportion of the population which reported for severe symptoms of diabetes after being infected with coronavirus was around 75 percent. This shows that the virus is aggravating the status quo on diseases in the worst possible manner. However, no effect of the virus could be found on ulcer formation.

Four people who died when their boat capsized as they tried to cross the Channel from France to Britain were all members of a Kurdish-Iranian family, British media reported Wednesday.
 Rasoul Iran-Nejad and Shiva Mohammad Panahi, both 35, and their two children, Anita, nine, and Armin, aged six, all drowned during stormy weather on Tuesday.
 The capsize is the worst loss of life in a single incident and takes the number of migrants to have lost their lives attempting the Channel crossing this year to seven.
 Iran-Nejad's brother Ali told the BBC that the couple's 15-month-old baby, Artin, was still missing but a search has been called off.
 "Some say he is alive, some say he is dead. We are confused," he said. "Our family here are desperate. My father, mother and sisters are crying their eyes out."
 Ali said the family had paid a large sum to get to Britain, while Choman Manish, who knew them, said he had warned them several times not to undertake the perilous crossing.
 "They trusted in God, they think God will protect them," Manish, who lives at a migrant camp in Dunkirk, told Sky News television.
 Kurdish-Iranians at the camp were devastated by the loss of the family, who came from Sardasht, near the Iraqi border, he added.
 According to official French figures, 6,200 migrants tried to get across the Channel between January 1 and August 31, stoking anger and calls for action on the British side.
 Britain has accused France of not doing enough to prevent migrants from leaving but Prime Minister Boris Johnson has offered the authorities "every support" in the investigation.
 Both he and interior minister Priti Patel criticised "ruthless criminal gangs" for exploiting the vulnerable.
 \- No life jackets -
 The tragedy has also led to calls on both France and Britain from children's charities and others to provide safer, legal routes for those seeking asylum.
 "The Channel must not become a graveyard for children," said Save the Children.
 Dunkirk prosecutor Sebastien Pieve earlier told reporters that 14 migrants who were plucked from the water would all be questioned in a bid to identify those responsible.
 The group had set off for the south coast of England in a small fishing boat but it turned over in choppy waters at about 9:30 am (0830 GMT).
 Investigators believe the migrants were taken from the Grande-Synthe migrant camp to a nearby beach then sailed for some 40 minutes before bad weather forced them to turn back.
 "None of them is thought to have had life jackets," he said.
 A passing English vessel reported the capsize and triggered a large search and rescue operation involving six boats and three aircraft.
 Pieve said one of the survivors who was still receiving medical treatment had not been questioned by French border police. The others were all aged 16 and over.
 Up to 22 people may have been on board the vessel at the time, "which means three people are still missing, including a very young child", he added.
 Pieve indicated the youngster was the family's third child.
 The inquiry is seeking to establish who was responsible, and any potential grounds for prosecution, including against the vessel's skipper, he added.
 The four victims are thought to have been in the cabin of the boat at the time of the capsize, according to eyewitnesses.

SPRINGFIELD - Six of the state's 11 coronavirus mitigation regions will be under escalated restrictions starting Wednesday as hospitalizations for COVID-19 show a quickening rate of increase.
   
 "So no matter where in Illinois you call home, as you go about your daily lives, remember that this is not over," Gov. JB Pritzker said at his daily COVID-19 briefing in Peoria. "There seems to be a COVID storm on the rise. And we have to get prepared."
   
 As of Sunday night, there were 2,638 people hospitalized with COVID-19, including 589 in intensive care unit beds and 238 on ventilators - all were once again highs not seen since early to mid-June.
   
 A Capitol News Illinois analysis shows the weekly average hospital bed usage from Monday, Oct. 19 to Sunday, Oct. 25 increased by 495 to a total of 2,488, or roughly 25 percent, from the previous week. ICU bed usage increased by 118 to a total of 534 on average, an increase of 28 percent from the previous week. Average daily ventilator use increased by 51 from the week prior to 210, a jump of 32 percent.
   
 "At the beginning of the pandemic, we were concerned about overwhelming our hospitals and we must take action now to prevent that possibility," Illinois Department of Public Health Director Dr. Ngozi Ezike said in a news release.
   
 Pritzker's office on Monday made the announcement that suburban Cook County's Region 10 will enter Tier 1 of the state's mitigation protocols after seeing an increase in positivity rate and hospital admissions for eight of the past 10 days. Region 4, which includes the Metro East area on the Missouri border near St. Louis, will see the mitigations after its positivity rate remained above 8 percent for three days.
   
 Region 4 was previously under added mitigations from Aug. 18 to Oct. 9, while Region 10 is the first to trigger mitigations by a route other than three days above an 8 percent seven-day average positivity rate.
   
 The state's rolling seven-day average test positivity rate hit 6.3 percent Monday, the highest it's been since June 2. That's after IDPH reported an average of 4,984 confirmed cases among an average 70,959 test results reported each day from Saturday through Monday. That made for a three-day positivity rate of 7 percent, and the 6,161 cases announced for Saturday set the state's one-day record.
   
 Another 104 COVID-19-positive individuals died over the previous three days, bringing the death toll to 9,522 among 378,985 confirmed cases and more than 7.3 million tests conducted since the pandemic began. Ezike said if the current trends continue, Illinois is on a path to see 11,000 dead from the virus by the end of the year.
   
 While there is a 97 percent recovery rate - meaning 97 percent of COVID-19-positivie individuals are alive 42 days after diagnosis, according to IDPH - Pritzker and Ezike said there are often lasting side effects for survivors.
   
 "There are currently more than 2,500 Illinoisans in the hospital fighting this virus, and unfortunately because we now have so many new people getting infected, that number will likely rise over the coming weeks," Pritzker said. "Many of those people will survive, but many will have lasting damage to their lungs and other internal organs."
   
 Ezike said all Illinoisans should take care to wash their hands, maintain social distance, wear face coverings and avoid large crowds, doing all of them together to further protect themselves.
   
 "The goal should not be to be lax with getting infected because the chances of survival are good," Ezike said. "But as we know, it's not clear who will succumb to this virus or not. Yes, it's true that our older members of society, and people with pre-existing conditions are among the higher risk, but we have heard countless stories of individuals, even teenagers, with no known medical conditions that have succumbed to this virus."
   
 Dr. Michael Cruz, chief operating officer of OSF HealthCare based in Peoria, agreed that OSF doctors had seen "otherwise healthy individuals who have succumbed to this virus."
   
 "This is the time when we have to double down," he said. "We need everyone's help to prevent further escalation of this pandemic in our area, and to help us reduce the impact on our health care resources, which are being used fully at this time."
   
 He said all Illinoisans should get their flu shot to help avoid strain on the system.
   
 Asked about a potential need for field hospitals in the future, Pritzker said "we have the ability, by limiting capacity at certain locations like bars and restaurants, by everybody wearing a mask and so on, to avoid the need for field hospitals, but we've kept warm at least one facility."
   
 That's in suburban Cook County, he said.
   
 Ahead of the holiday season, Pritzker said people getting together with family and friends should wear masks and keep six feet of distance from each other, even when gathering in private.
   
 While Pritzker has said he is not considering a statewide stay-at-home order, at the current rate of increase to COVID-19 positivity rates, all of the state's 11 regions could soon be under escalated mitigations.
   
 As of Friday, Oct. 23, the latest IDPH data available, Region 9 in north suburban Lake and McHenry counties had reached an 8.1 percent positivity rate, meaning two more days at the level would lead to added mitigations.
   
 Region 3 in the Springfield area and several surrounding counties and Region 6 in east-central Illinois were at 7.8 percent, while Region 11, which includes only Chicago, had a positivity rate of 7.7 percent. Region 2, which includes Peoria and several surrounding counties, had the lowest positivity rate at 7.2 percent.
   
 Mitigations in effect in Regions 1, 5, 7 and 8 and soon to be in effect in Regions 4 and 10 include the closure of bars and restaurants to indoor service, and Ezike noted last week that an outdoor structure used by bars or restaurants must be open on at least two sides, otherwise it will be considered an indoor structure. Outdoor service must close at 11 p.m.
   
 Meetings, social events and gatherings both indoor and outdoor will be capped at the lesser of 25 guests or 25 percent of overall room capacity for those under Tier 1 of the mitigation plan, while casinos will close at 11 p.m. and be capped at 25 percent of capacity. Party buses will not be allowed to operate.
   
 Last week, Ezike said casinos are allowed to open at 25 percent capacity because they are large, well ventilated spaces.
   
 Pritzker once again reiterated that the state would enforce mitigations, potentially with revocation of gambling machine or liquor licenses after first issuing citations or dispersal orders.
   
 "Where we know we've got scofflaws, where we know there are bars and restaurants or others who are putting the public in danger, we have asked our state police to go to those areas," he said.
   
 The mitigations do not apply to schools, which have separate guidance provided by the Illinois State Board of Education which remains in effect. Districts can choose locally whether students will participate in in-person learning.

 Plewes added that Nancy's leather jacket from "The Craft" also inspired some of the outerwear used in the reboot.
 "There are so many elements from her closet in the original that withstand the test of time," Plewes said of Nancy's wardrobe. "Her patent-leather jacket in the original is something that doesn't go out of style, and in the new movie, Lourdes wears a lot of patent leather, which is kind of an homage to the original."
 In addition to incorporating hints of nostalgic prints, textures, and accessories, Plewes left her mark on "The Craft: Legacy" by giving the new characters' wardrobes modern updates and punches of color.

Sleep impacts every one of our biological systems. Serious consequences can result with poor sleep quality. Here's a short list: Blood pressure may increase. Risk of coronary heart disease could go up. Our endocrine system releases more cortisol, a stress hormone. We become more aroused by "fight or flight" syndrome. There's a reduction of growth hormone and muscle maintenance. There's a higher chance of increased appetite and weight gain. The body has less glucose tolerance and greater insulin resistance; in the long term, that means an increased risk for Type 2 diabetes.

Always communicate about your sexual status. (That stands no matter what type of dating or relationship sitch you're in!) You should ask new partners when they've been tested for STIs before you have sex with them, and determine your comfort with their answer. The rule of thumb is to get tested every three months, and between fluid bonding with new partners, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It's important to educate yourself with how STIs are transmitted, so you know how you're putting yourself at risk. (See: How Often Should You Get Tested for STDs?)

The Phillies need to know how good organizations operate. The Dodgers and Rays are two of the best in baseball. They also happen to be the only two teams that, as of last night, were still playing baseball in 2020.
 This shouldn’t be complicated. When the Dodgers needed an executive who could reshape the organization into one that was capable of sustaining success in the modern era, it hired the best executive it could find. After they lured Andrew Friedman away from the Rays with a big check and the title of president, Friedman surrounded himself with executives who had shared space with Theo Epstein during their formative years. Three years earlier, the Cubs had given the former Red Sox GM the title and the check and the free rein to reshape their franchise. Friedman also poached Farhan Zaidi from Billy Beane’s A’s. Four years later, the Giants poached Zaidi from Friedman. They gave him the title. And the check. And the free rein.
