Sewell praised the diversity of Democrats’ historically large field and said it “saddens” her to see black candidates drop out. But Sewell said the hand- wringing over Democrats’ all-white slate of remaining top contenders misses Biden’s appeal and deep connections in the black community, especially among older African Americans and black women.

With a wide open GOP presidential field, Cain is likely to catch fire and become a top tier candidate. Republicans need someone who will be able to go toe to toe with Obama and match his liberal philosophy with strong conservative convictions. Cain has the zeal, the speaking ability and the good old fashioned common sense to connect with the American people. Republican voters should give him every consideration. In fact there is no reason why Herman Cain should not be at the very top of the list.

Alabama, where African Americans are expected to cast a majority of primary ballots, has 52 Democratic pledged delegates at stake, part of the 1,357 up for grabs on Super Tuesday. That’s about a third of the party's pledged delegates nationally. Biden is in a cluster atop polls in Iowa and New Hampshire, the two overwhelmingly white states that begin 2020 voting in early February. But polls consistently show him with a wide lead among black voters who make up significant portions of the states that follow, starting with Nevada and South Carolina and continuing through the Super Tuesday slate.

We found that the limited-slip rear differential can find traction even if one tire is on pavement and the other is on ice. The latest adaptive dampers smooth over choppy snow with help from a quicker electrical architecture. When the Yukon goes on sale, it'll be fit for a family cruise across the country.

The prosecutor said firefighters were on the scene within eight minutes of the 999 call, and found the front door of the flat "well alight".
 Donning breathing apparatus, the firefighters entered the property and found "the entire flat filled with thick black smoke". They located the occupant, who was suffering with smoke inhalation, and took him to safety.
 When police arrived they tracked Smitham down to her own flat - but she climbed out onto a window ledge and claimed she could not find the key to the front door to let officers in. Police eventually talked her down, then used a battering ram to gain entry.
 Fire officers later determined the seat of the blaze had been the letter box of the target flat.
 Meanwhile the casualty had been rushed to intensive care suffering with lung damage from smoke inhalation, and was placed in a medical coma for two weeks.
 In an impact statement read to court, the casualty said he was concerned about the possible long-term effects of the incident on his well-being.
 Smitham, of Cil y Coed, Waunarlwydd, Swansea had previously pleaded guilty to arson when she appeared in the dock for sentencing.
 The court heard she has previous convictions for criminal damage, public order matters, and for a battery committed against her father.
 Stuart John, for Smitham, said the defendant and her partner had been in a "co-dependant and mutually destructive" relationship.
 He said his client's "troubled upbringing" and resultant substance misuse "play no small part in the commission of the offence".
 The advocate said Smitham had been under the influence of Valium on the night in question, and the incident marked an "extreme escalation" in her offending.
