Our business has been busier than we expected during this time. Brokers with clients who have decided to stay active during these unprecedented times have seen their listings sell, and in many cases, due to others pulling off the market, they are seeing multiple offers. I anticipate the rest of the year will be slightly slower than last year; however, I am anticipating that sales will continue during the traditionally slower summer months and expect our annual sales to be close to last year.

The 2020 field season is the second of three field seasons that I will conduct for my Ph.D., and I had plans to hit the ground running. Instead, we have whittled our six-person crew down to three and are living in trailers without running water, rather than in U.S. Forest Service housing that normally would be available.

I started the year with 40 listings -- it was to be my greatest year ever. Sixteen of them are on hold. We have few listings going on the market, and I worry that all that on-hold inventory will all hit the market at once. It will be a wonderful time to be a buyer in my area.

The biggest change I've made is to my mindset over the past six weeks. At first, I was getting easily frustrated and flustered, especially while trying to work from home with a 1 year old and a 2 ½ year old. Now, I've learned to "go with the flow" and embrace the chaos.  I remind myself that everything I need to do will get done. In times like this, connection to family and friends is most important.

Since the market was forced to grind to a halt, there is pent-up demand out there. Real estate is an "in-person" business. The outlook for our industry depends on how fast the stock market rebounds and how the economy recovers. Continued low interest rates will also help spur activity once we come back.
