Cooped up and silenced, humans have traded places with so many of their avian relatives for vast stretches of this pandemic. Meanwhile, the winged creatures have flown high and swooped low, tweeting frenziedly here, whistling sweetly there, starring in their own open-air opera. Feathers unfettered. Spirit ablaze. Droppings galore. And audience be damned. While birds use their song and flight for a range of reasons linked to survival, I just can't stop marvelling at the fact that they sometimes do it just for fun. How inspiring to see this streak of leisure in their relentlessly hardworking nature.The crow chroniclesWe city wallahs have a far from ideal relationship with our beaked cousins. I, for one, am guilty of being very unfriendly towards those gurgling, bumbling, window-banging specimens that there are too many of to even take notice anymore. Of course, one wants them to be fed and their social needs met. But if only their upkeep would happen somewhere far away, where there is no danger of rotating fan blades or predatory house cats. Not to pigeonhole the creatures or anything, but they are, in fact, birdbrained.On the other hand, there's something about crows that draws my respect. They're the hustlers, the fighters, the survivors. Whether they're cawing ruthlessly at the window just as you're about to take that rainy-day nap, or slipping through the grill to steal your dinner, there's something so swift and focused about the creatures that you've got to admire them. Celebrated British poet Ted Hughes ascribed mythic value to them in his collection, Life and Songs of the Crow. And I'm merely one ounce of inspiration away from crowing about them myself. Cloud cuckoo landFor Mumbaikars, the parakeets that perch on the cables hanging between buildings are a reminder that all is still not lost in the greying city. They pop up before us all the time in a burst of colour and activity, but we seem to be largely unimpressed. And that's where the lockdown's been so ear-opening. The soundtrack to the summer of isolation has been entirely composed by a motley choir of birds. They've audio-bombed Zoom calls and hijacked Insta lives, forcing us digital zombies to pay attention. They've been bold, persistent and surprising - like boy bands in the '90s, but less annoying and with better hairdos. The wonder of it all is that they've always been here, drowned out by the heavy metal combination of traffic, construction and gadgets. Stripped of these layers of noise, we're left with birdsong, uplifting in unexpected ways. Emboldened by the attention they've been getting, the koels and mynahs have been reprising some of their B-side songs. They've stretched their repertories and spruced up their acts. I finally know why Anil Kumar was likening Madhuri Dixit to a cuckoo in Beta. A koel is indeed a sweet-sounding bird, that's if it isn't conducting its riyaaz at an obscene hour that even the early birds frown upon.What a hootIn the suburb where I live, there are enough roosters in the yards of crumbling cottages to remind you of a Gerald Durrell idyll. Their full-throttled calls remind me of other people's childhood, a kind of borrowed nostalgia. I've had the occasional brush with a Red-whiskered Bulbul and chance encounter with an Oriental magpie-robin. Then there's the barbet in its coat of vivid green, with a splash of orange and red. Fantails and sunbirds. Orioles and kingfishers. With excursions to hills and forests still a distant dream, these cooing cameos in balconies and on window sills have shown us that nature, in fact, visits our homes regularly. But for all the drama of the showy birds, there's one creature that's in a flock of its own. There's a strange thrill in spotting an owl (pun regretted) on the scaffolding of a building or the top of a flagpole at midnight, calmly - and condescendingly - surveying the scene below.Jungles have a wealth of birds embellishing the branches of trees and sides of hills, but a bird in the city is worth two in the wilderness. We need them to remind us that gravity can be defied, vocal cords stretched and colours mixed madly. And that nature, too, is occasionally looking for some fun.Follow @rehana_munir on Twitter and InstagramFrom HT Brunch, June 21, 2020Follow us on twitter.com/HTBrunchConnect with us on facebook.com/hindustantimesbrunch

PORT LEYDEN — The Port Leyden park will soon feature whimsical renderings of plants and animals in the area created by local artist Lydia Johnson Huntress.


  Ms. Huntress, a resident of Lyons Falls, applied for and won a $2,500 Public Art Fellowship grant to do the community murals at the urging of friends, Mayor Heather Collins and resident Darci Byrne, who had seen some of her other work, including a large mural at a Boonville church.


  “They approached me about applying for the grant and we worked together to submit the application last fall. The awards were given in February and we’ve gone from there,” Mrs. Huntress said.


  According to Mrs. Collins, more than seven other artists also submitted their work for the flora and fauna idea but ultimately they “were blown away with the connection we felt to [Mrs. Huntress’] art when she made a submission. We instantly knew this one was the one!”


  Ms. Huntress will be creating plant-life murals that will be mounted on the back of the public pool house and animal-life panels for “the old field days barn.” There will be four panels in each series, one for every season.


  “The different species will be labeled with their names and things, so we’re using it as a tool to help us connect with the environment around us and will hopefully encourage people to pay closer attention to what is special about our area,” Mrs. Huntress said.


  The locations of the buildings will allow the murals to face the playground on both sides and one of the series can also be viewed from State Route 12.


  Each panel will be four-foot squares of high-quality plywood and Mrs. Huntress will be using house paint to ensure durability.


  “The panels will allow us to take them down in the winter, just to preserve them longer, or move them if things need to be shifted at any point. The goal is to give them longer life by having them be movable artwork,” she said.


  While nature and ecology have long been the source of her artistic inspiration, Mrs. Huntress said the flora and fauna murals “were the brainchild of Heather and Darci.”


  Mrs. Collins said she had learned about the grant opportunity at a “grant seeker meeting” and after attending another grant meeting with Ms. Byrne, “the wheels began turning. Our imaginations ran wild for our small community park.”


  “We want to pass along to the community youth a knowledge of plants and animals native to our area,” Mrs. Collins said.


  One requirement of the grant was to engage the community in the project, so Mrs. Huntress created a Facebook page featuring a link to a survey in which people are asked to select the flora and fauna they believe best represents the area among those she sketched for each season.


  Those that receive the most votes will be featured more prominently in the panels surrounded by written-in suggestions.


  “Each panel is going to feature lots of what’s special about our area in each season and each category,” Mrs. Huntress said, “It is neat to see what people associate with our area.”


  Some of those suggestions, however, like a polar bear and a penguin, may not end up making the panels, she said, and she is not yet sure what to do about the mosquito and poison ivy suggestions, but she’s working on it.


  So far, 23 surveys have been completed and Mrs. Huntress will accept responses until the end of June.


  She is hoping to have the mural finished by the end of July.


  Funding for the fellowship came from the Decentralization Program of the state Council for the Arts. The program, administered by the St. Lawrence Council of the Arts, is supported by Gov. Andrew Cuomo and the state legislature.

Syracuse University football coach Dino Babers landed a verbal commitment from 2021 three-star Illinois offensive guard Wes Hoeh on Friday.


  The 6-foot-4, 250-pound prospect became the second offensive lineman and 12th player overall to commit to the Orange for the 2021 cycle, all of which are listed at three stars by the 247Sports composite ratings system.


  Hoeh declared his intentions to join the Orange with a post on social media in which he thanked his parents, coaches, and teammates.


  “Thank you to the entire coaching staff at Syracuse for welcoming me into the Syracuse family,” Hoeh stated in the announcement. “Very proud to announce my commitment to Syracuse University.”


  Hoeh — a native of Glen Ellyn, Ill., who is entering his senior campaign at Glenbard West High School — is rated as the No. 84 guard in his class nationally and the 47th-best prospect overall from Illinois by 247Sports.


  He opted to play for the Orange over 10 reported offers that included Air Force, Navy, Bowling Green, and Central Michigan.


  The Orange entered the weekend at No. 52 in the 247Sports team rankings for the class of 2021 recruiting class and No. 57 by the Rivals.com list.


  Babers and offensive coordinator Sterlin Gilbert are also reportedly in strong pursuit of 2021 three-star California quarterback target Justin Lamson, who confirmed earlier this week via social media that he had received an offer from the Orange.


  Lamson is rated as the nation’s 18th-best dual-threat threat quarterback and the No. 51 player overall from California by 247Sports, and recently told the publication that he viewed SU among his top schools and planned to make his decision within the next three weeks.


  The 6-foot-3, 210-pound rising recruit from Oak Ridge High School and El Dorado Hills, Calif., also has offers from Louisville and UCLA, among 13 reported scholarship extensions.


  The Orange is hopeful that Lamson will become a key factor in the fast- growing 2021 class that added Hoeh and three-star Hawaii offensive tackle, Austyn Kauhi, up front over the past week.


  The new linemen joined Illinois tight end Landon Morris, South Carolina wide receiver Kendall Long, and Pennsylvania running back Josh Hough as 2021 offensive recruits to commit to SU.


  The Orange has also received 2021 verbal pledges from linebackers Austin Roon (Michigan) and Malik Matthew (Bronx), along with Rochester-Fairport High School defensive tackle Jaelin Moss, Georgia defensive lineman Derek McDonald, Wisconsin defensive end Hayden Nelson, Massachusetts defensive tackle Terry Lockett, and Pennsylvania defensive back Malcolm Folk.


  ROSCOE GRANTED WAIVER


  Cody Roscoe will be able to play for the SU football team for the upcoming season, according to a report by Syracuse.com.


  Roscoe — the 6-foot-1 and 247-pound defensive lineman that announced Monday he was transferring to SU from McNeese State — has one season of eligibility remaining.


  The NCAA approved Roscoe’s request for immediate eligibility due to his good academic standing compared to the Cowboys’ postseason ban for failing to meet the Academic Progress Rate threshold, per the report.


  Roscoe recorded nine sacks and 11 tackles for loss while garnering All- Southland Conference third team honors last season.


  FREENEY, HARRISON ON BALLOT


  Syracuse football icons Dwight Freeney and Marvin Harrison were among the 78 players from FBS schools listed on the ballot released last week for induction into the National Football Foundation College Hall of Fame.


  Freeney played defensive end for the Orange from 1998-2001 and finished second in program history for career sacks (34) and established SU career records with 50.5 tackles for loss and 14 forced fumbles. He played 16 NFL seasons after being selected No. 11 overall in the 2002 draft by the Indianapolis Colts.


  Harrison starred at wide receiver for SU from 1992-95 and finished with 135 catches for 2,827 yards and 20 touchdowns. His career receiving yardage total stood as the SU record for more than two decades until Steve Ishmael (2,891) established a new mark in 2017. Harrison was also a first-round NFL Draft pick of the Colts and made eight Pro Bowls in 13 NFL seasons.


  The announcement of the 2021 NFF College Hall of Fame class is expected to be released early next year.

Liverpool have made a mockery of their Premier League opponents this season and now comes the task of finishing the story in style. The Covid-19 virus was Liverpool&rsquo;s biggest opponent in recent months as the global pandemic came closer to halting their march to title glory than any of their rivals on the pitch, with the next few weeks offering Jurgen Klopp and his team a chance to cement their place in history.We all recall the eulogies for Pep Guardiola and his Manchester City side as they became the first in the Premier League era to reach 100 points for a season when they won the title a couple of years back.Guardiola was hailed as a master who had reinvented football, even though those singing his praises overlooked the fact he was handed £500m to build a team that were tipped to dominate English football for years to come.Well, if you are the genius many people say you are, Pep – what does that make Klopp in a season when he has put you in your place in no uncertain terms by winning the Premier League with embarrassing ease?Just two years on from that 100-point milestone being reached, all those records City achieved can be shattered by a great Liverpool squad that has banished the notion that Guardiola and his dream team are unbeatable.To be 22 points ahead going into the final nine rounds of matches this weekend left the chasing pack red-faced, with each and every one of them shown up to be second rate compared to this Liverpool dream team.I read my old pal Jamie Carragher in the Sunday World last weekend suggesting City are not as far behind Liverpool as the table might suggest, but there is no getting away from the domination Klopp has overseen.What they need to do next is secure the legacy of a team that should go down in history as one of the best we have seen in English football, despite their disappointing exits in the Champions League and FA Cup.Klopp won&rsquo;t know how his side are going to perform as they get back into action against Everton on Sunday evening – and his champions-in- waiting owe it to themselves to make sure they finish this remarkable season on a high.They should be aiming to break the 100-point barrier in their final nine games, they could target 100 goals if they hit top form and Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane should be trying to fill their scoring boots as they go after the Golden Boot.I&rsquo;m sure Klopp will play a few young players in these nine matches and it would be good to give them some first-team experience, but I&rsquo;d like to see Liverpool put nine more wins on the board to finish with a total of 109 points.It would create a record that would stand the test of time and may never be beaten, as it would be as close to perfection as we have ever seen before in a major European league.You might say these statistics don&rsquo;t count for much, as the title win is all that matters, but the great champions leave their mark in the history books and this Liverpool team have a chance to do that over this strange summer that we are all living through.Sunday evening&rsquo;s game at Goodison Park will be one of the more curious occasions in the history of this great fixture, with Merseyside derby No 236 the first to be played without spectators in attendance.It will feel different and the intimidation offered up by Everton fans at Goodison will be absent as fake crowd noise replaces the real thing on TV screens on Sunday.What was once a friendly derby between the two great teams of my home city has lost some of its charm in recent years, with Everton and Liverpool fans no longer as jovial with each other as they once were. The rivalry between red and blue in Liverpool is nowhere near as nasty as it is when Manchester United are involved.Yet this contest has certainly developed a prickly edge in the last decade and more, which has been a shame to see.Liverpool fans would love to see their heroes get one of the two wins they need to confirm the title win in this fixture, but the strange atmosphere around this game might just give Everton hope of causing an upset.They have not won a derby game in a decade and in manager Carlo Ancelotti, they have a tactician who proved he can make life difficult for Klopp&rsquo;s men during his time in charge of Napoli.Ancelotti sets his team up to nullify Liverpool&rsquo;s strengths – and it worked for him on more than one occasion in the Champions League over the last couple of seasons.Liverpool rarely looked at their best in those matches. But the question is whether he has the quality of players to replicate those tactics at Everton. And all the evidence of this season is that he has not.No, for me, if Klopp&rsquo;s side can get back to anywhere near the form they showed before the lockdown, they will sweep to victory on Sunday.So I am backing Liverpool to get the win that will set them up for a title-winning moment when Crystal Palace head for Anfield on Wednesday night.

NATICK - A Burlington woman admitted to drinking Thursday before causing a three-car crash, police said.
 Police arrested Ashley Steadman, 27, after the 11:30 p.m. crash at the intersection of Speen Street and Superior Drive, police spokeswoman Lt. Cara Rossi said Friday.
 The crash occurred after a Toyota Tacoma stopped at a red light. The vehicle behind it, a Honda Civic, also stopped. But police say a third vehicle, a Mazda 6 driven by Steadman, did not.
 "Car number three (Mazda) crashed into car number two (Honda) and pushed it into car number one (Tacoma)," Rossi said.
 No one was injured, but two of the three vehicles were not operable after the crash and had to be towed, Rossi said.
 Police say that when they spoke to Steadman, it appeared she may have been under the influence of something. She admitted to police that she had three vodka drinks prior to driving, the lieutenant said.
 Steadman refused to perform a field sobriety tests or take a Breathalyzer test, meaning her license was automatically suspended for 180 days.
 Police arrested Steadman, of 6 Van Norden Road, and charged her with operating a vehicle under the influence of liquor; and driving without a license. She was also cited for failing to stop for a red light.
 After her arraignment Friday in Natick District Court, Steadman was released without bail. She is due back in court on Sept. 1 for a pretrial conference.

Falls has filled two roles with one employee.
   
 On Monday, supervisors unanimously appointed assistant manager Matthew Takita to serve as township manager while continuing his dual role as director of building, planning and code enforcement at an annual salary of $160,000 per year.
   
 "He wanted to remain as the building and code director," supervisor Chairman Jeff Dence said during Monday's meeting. "He's done a great job. He led us through the COVID-19 situation. His leadership skills are great."
   
 Takita joined the township in October at an annual salary of $120,000 and began serving as interim manager in February following the resignation of former Manager Peter Gray, who served in that role for 12 years.
   
 Takita's contract prohibits his personal business, MTA, LLC Architecture & Urban Design Firm, from interfering with his role as manager, officials said.
   
 Prior to joining Falls, Takita served as Bensalem's director of building and planning department for 24 years and authored zoning regulations for a 675-acre revitalization district on the Delaware River.
   
 Takita has worked in public service since 1992 after earning a bachelor's degree in architecture from Spring Garden College in 1991.
   
 He holds two dozen certifications from the International Code Council and more than a dozen Pennsylvania Uniform Construction Code licenses. He also is a member and former chair of the International Code Council - Building Code Exam Advisory Committee.
   
 Filling the manger position ends a tumultuous stretch of uncertainty in the township's administration.
   
 Gray initially announced he planned to resign Oct. 1, but abruptly reversed his decision in September and agreed to a two-year extension to his contract that was set to expire Dec. 31.
   
 The deal included a $5,000 salary bump retroactive to Jan. 1. Records show Gray's salary as $144,439 for 2018. For 2017, Gray's salary was listed as $143,741.
   
 Yet Gray was paid $161,254 in 2017, wage documents showed.

TALLAHASSEE --- While calls to require residents to wear face masks grow louder amid rising COVID-19 cases, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis continues to maintain his position that mask-wearing should be voluntary.
   
 At a news conference in Miami Friday, DeSantis said people need to abide by local mask-wearing requirements. But that's as far as the governor was willing to go, as he reiterated a position about personal freedoms.
   
 "This has to be voluntarily because the Constitution is not suspended just because there is a virus," DeSantis said. "You do have a right to protest, you have a right to go to religious service, all these other things."
   
 The numbers of new COVID-19 cases reported daily by the state have been increasing by record amounts. The state Friday announced 3,822 new cases, making Florida a new national hotspot for the spread of the virus.
   
 The data released by the Department of Health shows the state has had 89,748 COVID-19 cases and 3,104 deaths related to the virus. Florida has had 28,260 new COVID-19 cases in the past two weeks.
   
 The governor has offered several explanations for the spike, including increased testing among high-risk people such as nursing home residents. He also said migrant workers and construction workers have been testing positive for COVID-19, in part, because of cramped living and working conditions. On Friday, he also repeatedly said that many of the positive test results involve younger adults, who are less prone to severe medical problems because of the virus.
   
 The surge in cases, however, is the impetus behind moves by a number of local governments to mandate that residents wear masks. Residents in Orange County will be required to wear masks beginning Saturday. There are no fines for people who violate the policy.
   
 Tampa's mayor ordered citizens to wear masks in public or face potential citations. In neighboring Pinellas County, workers who interact with the public also are now required to wear masks. Broward County residents who don't wear facial coverings in public indoor spaces can face second degree misdemeanors. Miami-Dade County has taken similar steps. And in the Florida Keys, the Monroe County Commission has required everyone to wear face coverings for the next year.
   
 The Florida Medical Association issued a statement Friday thanking local governments that have mandated face masks and calling on others to follow suit. The FMA is the largest physicians association in the state.
   
 "The science is clear. Asymptomatic infected individuals can release infectious aerosol particles while breathing and speaking," FMA President Ronald F. Giffler said in a prepared statement. "Not wearing a mask or face covering increases exposure, whereas universal masking greatly reduces the spread of viral particles. The message is simple: For the sake of your health and the health of everyone around you, Florida's doctors want you to wear a mask."
   
 While DeSantis won't mandate the use of masks, he has encouraged them --- as has state Surgeon General Scott Rivkees --- and said there would be public service announcements on masks in the coming weeks.

Cummings created and starred in her own sitcom in 2011 called Whitney, where D'Elia played her long-term boyfriend. This close association made it strange to many fans when Cummings did not speak out immediately after allegations against D'Elia emerged. Starting early last week, several women went public on social media with stories about D'Elia trying to engage them in a sexual encounter while they were underage.


  Many women have been waiting on a response from Cummings, judging by the replies to her tweet. In her work, Cummings often addresses topics of sexism, misogyny and other gender-related issues. She is also seen as a trailblazer to many, rising quickly through the industry and working variously as a stand-up comic, a writer, producer, director, showrunner and podcaster.


  "I'm so glad you've finally spoken about this!!" one fan wrote to Cummings on Saturday. "And I'm proud of you for sticking to the young women's side and not his. I know this is hard for you, but thank you!" Another fan shared a similar sentiment, writing: "it can't be easy to learn this about a friend. I'm so sorry. Seeing your voice and heart in support of those young women (then girls) is so meaningful, thank you."

  Cummings and D'Elia co-starred as a snarky but relatively conventional couple for the duration of Whitney -- two seasons in total. In the beginning, the two are mutually opposed to marriage, but by the end, they decide to tie the knot. Some critics disliked this turn for the show, which got middling reviews for its entire run.


  D'Elia is accused of knowingly pursuing underage girls for sex, particularly during his stand-up tours around the country. Some women have even posted screenshots of text message exchanges with him where he solicits nude photos or asks them to come to his hotel room. D'Elia has denied allegations that he knew any of these girls were underage.

Embattled Pennridge school board Vice President Joan Cullen is being asked to resign from another position, and this call is coming from Bucks County's top elected official.
   
 County Commissioners Chairwoman Diane Ellis-Marseglia is asking Cullen to step down from her voluntary board position on the county planning commission for social media posts Marseglia calls "hateful, ignorant and unacceptable," a county news release put out Friday night said.
   
 In Twitter posts, Cullen denies the existence of systemic racism, sexism and homophobia. She acknowleges that all those problems exist, just not on a "systemic level."
   
 Another Cullen post that references blackface also drew the ire of Marseglia.
   
 "The county of Bucks strives to represent all of its residents equally, with respect and fairness," she said. "Comments made by Bucks County Planning Commission member Joan Cullen are hateful, ignorant and unacceptable. They do not reflect the values of Bucks County."
   
 Planning commission board members are appointed by the county commissioners.
   
 "Ms. Cullen was not appointed by this current administration, and we do not have the authority to remove her from her appointed position," Marseglia continued. "As chair, however, I call on her to resign this position immediately.
   
 "Should she choose to ignore this request and finish out her term, which ends in January 2021, I assure the public she will not be reappointed to any position by this board of commissioners."
   
 Cullen, a Republican in a county that now has a two-to-one Democratic commissioners majority, responded that she wasn't going to be reappointed anyway. She added her social media posts are being taken out of context and misrepresented, and that she has no intention of resigning from either the Pennridge or county board.
   
 An online petition, referencing the same posts, is calling on Cullen to step down from the Pennridge school board.
   
 "This is a coordinated attack by political operatives who seized a positive moment and inflamed tension through misrepresentation," Cullen wrote in an email to this news organization.
   
 "No one should resign a post for expressing a belief in the overall goodness of our nation, nor for exposing out of control viciousness and hypocrisy. We don't run our communities on fear, intimidation and silencing. We run them on respectful cooperation and by welcoming all voices in our discourse."
   
 The county news release said that in response to a June 21, 2019 Twitter post that denied the existence of systemic racism in America, Cullen posted "I'll add to this. There's also no systematic sexism, homophobia, etc. Those who try to convince you you're being held back by someone else DO NOT have your best interests in mind.
   
 "They NEED you to be a victim so they can control you. Break free! The only one holding you back is U."
   
 The twitter feed was recently reposted on the Facebook page of Pennridge School Board Watch.
   
 According to the county release, Cullen responded to a Feb. 20, 2019 Twitter post discussing white students wearing blackface, "You're clinging to a narrative because there's no defense of the blatant, outrageous, coordinated effort to smear 60+ million ppl as racistsexisthomophobicmisogynistbigots."
   
 Cullen said the background and context for her blackface post came from some testy interchanges between a Native American and some students from Covington Catholic School in Kentucky at the March For Life in Washington, D.C. in January 2019.
   
 Soon afterward, images emerged of Covington students wearing black paint on their bodies at sporting events. Some have defended the pictures as students simply exhibiting spirit by wearing one of the school colors.
   
 On her various posts touching on racism, sexism, homophobia and blackface, Cullen wrote in an email "I find it puzzling that believing the United States isn't a racist country would be considered a hateful, ignorant statement. Indeed, the sentiment is shared by many, and has been expressed very recently by both President Trump and Senator Tim Scott in public remarks.
   
 "Both these gentlemen said the same thing I believe, i.e. that although there is indeed racism in this country and we should confront it and eliminate it whenever it rears its ugly head, it is not fair to malign tens of millions of good people as being racist."
   
 On the blackface issue, she wrote: "In no way did I deny the offensiveness of what we think of as stereotypical blackface. I do believe that is offensive. I agree with the Mummers' banning of black face paint altogether. I think it was antagonistic and wrong of those who marched with it on this year.
   
 "In this instance, however, I was speaking directly to the disproportionate and wildly hypocritical reaction to an old picture of school kids at a basketball game, who painted their faces with one of their school colors.
   
 "As clearly misguided as we can all agree that was, it was not done with the malicious intent of true blackface, which is indeed meant to demean. Should some adult have said 'Uh hey, painting your face black is actually, really offensive, so use the other color?' Yes, I will definitely grant you that."
   
 Cullen said Robert Harvie, the other Democrat on the three-member county commissioners board along with Marseglia, called her Friday to ask for her resignation and she declined.
   
 "I did point out to Commissioner Harvie in our phone call that I think it's incredibly hypocritical that he supports Joe Biden, who recently made a blatantly racist comment about voters who might choose not to vote for him, while characterizing my comments about the overall goodness of my country as inappropriate," Cullen wrote in an email.
   
 In a radio interview last month with a popular African-American host, Biden said "If you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't Black."
   
 He walked back the comment hours later, acknowledging that he had perhaps been "much too cavalier."
   
 Harvie responded in an email on Saturday "I would like to see Ms. Cullen take responsibility for her own behavior instead of trying to deflect attention to others.
   
 "There are too many people in this country who spend their time pointing fingers at others and asking 'what about them?' when they should be looking at their own behavior and asking 'how can I do better?'"

Morrisville has moved on from a police officer who as suspended last year for allegedly harassing a resident.
   
 The borough council voted 5-3 to terminate the employment of Cpl. Michael Pitcher, who was suspended with pay for allegedly misusing law enforcement resources to harass a Lower Makefield man for driving too slowly.
   
 Council President Ted Parker and members Helen Hlahol, Robert Paul, Scott Robinson and Nancy Sherlock voted yes, while members Justin Bowers, Eileen Dreisbach and Michael Yager voted no.
   
 Lower Makefield police arrested Pitcher in July after a resident reported that he received a threatening phone call to his home on April 6, 2019, following a "road rage" incident.
   
 Police said that log-on information allegedly connected to Pitcher showed he logged into a law-enforcement only database used in police investigations to search the resident's vehicle registration information the day of the alleged incident. Two of these searches originated from the Morrisville Police Department, and a third was made by Lower Makefield police, authorities said.
   
 Police determined that the three calls made to the home were traced back to Pitcher's personal and work cellphones.
   
 Pitcher, who has been on the borough police force since 2007, was suspended with pay in July by borough council after being charged. He was put on paid administrative leave in April when the police department was notified about the investigation.
   
 Pitcher's annual salary for 2020 is $91,865, according to borough Manager Scott Mitchell.
   
 Pitcher is awaiting trial in Bucks County court on charges of felony unlawful use of a computer and misdemeanor charges of terroristic threats, official oppression and harassment. He is free on $5,000 unsecured bail, according to court records.
   
 His fate with the department has been up in the air for months as his trial date is indefinitely delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic.
   
 Paul said the borough needed to act due to financial limitations and national circumstances regarding excessive police force.
   
 "Because this is a case of alleged police brutality, at least dominance and taking advantage of the public, I think it's important for us to take a moral position that we're not going to condone or tolerate this kind of police misconduct," Paul said.
   
 Dreisbach and Yager said they were worried the move could open the borough up to a potential lawsuit.
   
 "This has been a difficult situation for the borough. This has been a difficult situation for the police department ... I am concerned that we will find it to be a horrible misstep in the long run to jump the gun on due process," Yager said. "I understand the want to do it, I wanted to do it a long time ago. I don't think it's the right move."
   
 During a meeting in February where a previous vote to remove Pitcher failed, Parker said the decision was based off the April 2019 incident as well as other issues that he declined to discuss.
   
 On Monday, Parker said he believes council should have removed Pitcher from his position last year. This news organization was unable to reach Pitcher's attorney Louis Busico for comment.
   
 Pitcher was promoted to the rank of corporal in 2014, and his duties included overseeing and leading numerous narcotics investigations in Bucks County and the surrounding areas as a Bucks County narcotics officer.
   
 Currently, the department has nine full-time and nine part-time officers, police Chief George McClay said Tuesday. Of these, one full-time and one part- time officer is out due to injuries, he said.

According to Healthline.com, dust mites have become a serious concern for families.
   
 "Dust mites can be difficult to detect due to their small size. These microscopic arthropods are estimated to be only 1/4 to 1/3 millimeters long.
   
 "You can only see them under a microscope, and even then, they only look like small white spider-like creatures.
   
 "Male dust mites can live over a month, while female dust mites can live up to 90 days.
   
 "The reason why dust mites are so prevalent in people's homes is that they feed off of dead skin cells.
   
 "On an average day, one person may shed 1.5 grams of dead skin cells, which can feed up to one million dust mites at a time.
   
 "Dust mites make their homes in places where dead skin cells are most likely to accumulate, such as bedding, furniture, and carpeting.
   
 "While you can find dust mites all over the world, these creatures tend to favor hot and humid climates.
   
 "Dust mites themselves are allergenic, meaning they can cause allergies. They also leave behind skin and fecal matter that may also trigger allergies".
   
 My gosh, I think I am going to throw up. I need some Benadryl.
   
 I'm sure you are wondering what generated my dust mite interest.
   
 Let me explain.
   
 My daughter Kelsey and I were watching the animal channel a few nights ago.
   
 I had never thought about dust mites, at any point in my life.
   
 Now, I'm overwhelmed with the thought of going to bed. And staying in bed.
   
 Did you know that the dust mite has eight hairy legs and are translucent, and that they do not have eyes? Neither do they have antenna.
   
 I can't bear any more of this talk.
   
 I'd rather birth a ninth child than hear that report again.
   
 But now, I have a bigger problem. I can't go to bed.
   
 Bedtime is the best part of my day. I lay back, read a book, play games on my cell, or just click the light off and dream away.
   
 Since the dust mite story, I can hardly lay down.
   
 Last night, it was 87 degrees outside with 100% humidity. It was intense.
   
 Therefore, I dressed in my heaviest footed, high-neck pajamas to go to bed.
   
 Josh came in the door, and asked, "Expecting a snowstorm?" I guess I looked like a polar bear with several layers.
   
 Our Pomeranian mocha actually laughed at me.
   
 Seriously, I just didn't want the dust mites to get me.
   
 Since all of this talk, I can't even sit on my bed. I think of 2 trillion dust mites having a party on my mattress.
   
 I've been thinking of their dead skin and their ... oh, I can't bear anymore.
   
 So what is the answer?
   
 Forget the 30-year warranty on the mattress.
   
 It's sound like the longer you have any bed or bedding, the larger attendance at the annual dust mites' family reunion.
   
 Although, I do have an idea ... I'm going to say longer prayers tonight.
   
 And when I am done, I am going to scream at the top of my lungs, "Dust mites, GET OUT!"
   
 Then, hopefully, the dust bug . . . mite just leave!

It seems like everyone you talk to these days claims to either have a Native American heritage or a German background. I have a little of both. Actually I guess you could say I am a Heinz 57, a typical American boy who grew up in this "melting pot" called the United States.
   
 One grandfather was English and the other one Scots-Irish. My grandmother's people on my dad's side were Native American, Cherokee and Kaw. On my mother's side, our dear ol' grandmother always said her folks were Dutch and were shoe carpenters and made wooden shoes in Holland. A genealogy study on her heritage confirmed that they were originally Germans who fled oppression and migrated into Holland before coming to America.
   
 Today in the U.S., there are about 50 million people of German ancestry, or 17% of the population - America's largest ancestral group, ahead of even Irish Americans and African Americans. California, Texas and Pennsylvania have the largest numbers of German origin. Several Upper Midwest states - Ohio, Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Nebraska and the Dakotas - have the highest proportion of German Americans, about one-third of the population of those seven states.
   
 If you remember your high school American history lessons, you may remember that the first English settlers arrived at Jamestown, Virginia in 1607, and they were accompanied by a German doctor, Dr. Johannes Fleischer. He was followed in 1608 by five German glassmakers and three carpenters. The first permanent German settlement in what became the United States was Germantown, Pennsylvania, founded near Philadelphia in 1683.
   
 None of the historical German states had American colonies, so all of those early German immigrants landed mostly in English colonies on the East Coast.
   
 Large numbers of Germans migrated from the 1680s to 1760s, with Pennsylvania the favored destination. They migrated to America for a variety of reasons. Of course, religious freedom was high on that list, but other factors were the worsening opportunities for farm ownership in central Europe and conscription into the military.
   
 Hoping for better economic conditions in America, German immigrants often were willing to pay for their passage by selling their labor for a period of time as indentured servants.
   
 Large sections of Pennsylvania and upstate New York attracted Germans. Most of them were Lutheran or German Reformed; many also belonged to smaller religious sects, such as the Mennonites. German Catholics did not arrive in large numbers until after the War of 1812. As time unfolded and more states were created, German immigrants pushed westward as pioneers just as other American did at the time.
   
 The unique story of German settlers in our neighborhood probably began in the 19th century German kingdom of Saxony. Lutheran Pastor Martin Stephan and many of his followers found themselves increasingly at odds with established Lutheranism. Stephen rounded up his flock of nearly 1,100 Saxon Lutherans and piled into four ships and left for the United States in November 1838.
   
 They arrived and docked at New Orleans two months later. Somehow, only three ships arrived safely though, they never knew whether the fourth ship may have encountered heavy seas and sank, or maybe had gotten lost and ended up on some other distant shore.
   
 After spending some time waiting and praying for that last ship, most of the remaining 750 immigrants headed up the Mississippi River, settling heavily in St. Louis and in present day Perry County, Missouri. As the years unfolded, they began to spread out into the rich farm lands along the Missouri River and continued onward upstream toward our neck of the woods by the time of Kansas statehood.

Local citizens including clergy and retired law enforcement plan a peaceful march and demonstration at noon on June 27 in New Bern, a response to the nationwide movement on racial equality.
   
 It is contingent upon approval of street closings by New Bern Aldermen at the June 23 meeting.
   
 The requested streets are Broad Street from the old Days Inn site at Five Points to East Front Street and East Front Street to South Front Street. The march will end at Union Point Park, and streets will reopen as the march rolls through. According to the application, the demonstration and march will conclude by 3 p.m. A rain date of July 18 was included.
   
 "Stop the Killing. Begin the Healing" is sponsored by New Bern Alumnae and Concerned Citizens of Craven County.
   
 It would be the second recent major march in New Bern since the nationwide Black Lives Matter movement began. There has also been a static demonstration in front of New Bern City Hall and a number of roadside demonstrations in front of Walmart on Dr. M.L. King Jr. Blvd.
   
 The June 27 events at the park include speakers - religious leaders, the top two law enforcement officers in Craven County, an educational professional and a teenager.
   
 The planned speakers at the park are Craven County Sheriff Chip Hughes; New Bern Police Chief Toussaint E. Summers; Senior Pastor Holly Raby of Word of God Christian Center; Apostle Linster Strayhorn of the United Worship Center; Presiding Elder Erlinda Dobson of the New Bern District of the N.C. Conference of the African Methodist Episcopal Church; Pastor Angela Scott of Refreshing Lives Church; Deacon Jim Hackett of Saint Paul Catholic Church; Greg Singleton, director of Workforce Readiness at Craven Community College and a project manager for Craven Pamlico ReEntry Council; and Nicholas Glover, a Craven Early College student who attends Word of God Christian Center.
   
 Natalie Standifer, president of New Bern Alumnae Chapter of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, said the idea for a peaceful march evolved from members in her group and was developed during a number of well-attended zoom meetings.
   
 Standifer, a retired Craven County jail administrator, said the theme is "Stop the Killing, Begin the Healing, Justice for All, That's Our Call."
   
 Other main organizational supporters include minister Holly Raby; Victor Taylor, retired correctional officer and former New Bern Alderman; and Chaplain Michael Bostian, director of Pastoral Care at CarolinaEast Medical Center.
   
 Standifer said the march and rally is a show of support for the overall racial equality movement.
   
 "We need to reach out to our law enforcement, we need to reach out to people in general," she said. "Our law enforcement here, we have no problem. We can sit down and talk to our sheriff and we can talk to our police chief. They have opened their policies and they have always been open and honest with us."
   
 Holly Raby, senior pastor at Word of God Christian Center, said he hopes to add to the dialogue the event is seeking.
   
 "I hope my voice will open ears, minds and hearts about the systemic racism and injustices that we are seeing, obviously more prevailing around the world," he said. "I am just hoping that I can add a voice that will not only open the hearts and minds of people, but there will be an entry way to healing and making a change."
   
 Raby, who has been in the area since 1997, said that peaceful goals require mindset changes by multitudes, many of whom he said are not listening to what is being said about core changes.
   
 "We can have all the ideals we want, but we are not going to change anything with just ideals," he continued. "Change is going to come through the convictions of our heart."
   
 Raby said wording and the context it portrays can be crucial, giving a personal example of someone who called him, saying they "didn't want to be part of a protest."
   
 "It is not so much that it is a protest, attacking, as it is against what is happening," he said, adding his concerns go beyond police. "There is urgency for health care, there is urgency for fair hiring, there is urgency in just how we treat people. Many have lost hope. Hopelessness is giving up. Hope allows us to do many things."
   
 Raby said that peaceful protests such as this and others around the country are the result of being organized and seeking positive cause and effect.
   
 Raby grew up in Southside Chicago and recalled that after the 1968 assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., protests turned to rioting which "tore that whole community up."
   
 He called it "a cocktail bomb" of rioters and gangs. More than a half-century later, his opinion of that kind of protest hasn't changed.
   
 "Rioting and destroying other people's property goes contrary to what the purpose is all about," he added.
   
 Chaplain Michael Bostian, who has been at CarolinaEast for 29 years, became involved in the peaceful march through Pastor Raby, who is one of his volunteer chaplains at the hospital.
   
 "The peaceful part is very important to Holly (Raby) and very important to me - to draw attention to the unlawful deaths of African Americans," Bostian said "You really can't look at that video (George Floyd) and say that justice was served. Whatever he did, and I was never clear that he did anything, he didn't deserve death. I am participating because I think it is an important issue."
   
 Emotion and anger continue to rise, especially in light of another police shooting death of a black man in Atlanta.
   
 Bostian is encouraged by what he sees as positive steps, such as NASCAR banning Confederate flags, the NFL's stronger stance on racism and other social and cultural changes.
   
 He said the local group "is focused, they are concrete and they do want for this not to just be a march that ends with a march."
   
 He points to opportunities at the end of the march for voter registration and completing the census as positives.
   
 "It is important that we affirm the dignity and worth of every person," he said. "Every life matters, black lives matter. From a faith standpoint, we are all created in the image of God and that means there is value within every person. That doesn't depend on skin color any more than it depends on the size of your nose or the length of your arms or legs."
   
 Bostian added that locally he feels it is important to note that "the city of New Bern has a police department that works hard to develop community relationships,"
   
 Victor Taylor said that because of his decades as a correctional officer and time as an Alderman, his main concern is that police receive the proper annual in-service training on how to handle situations ranging from conversation to physical hand-to-hand confrontations and displays of weapons.
   
 As for the march, he echoed the same sentiments about June 27 as the others.
   
 "We want a peaceful event."

 NATICK - A Burlington woman admitted to drinking Thursday before causing a three-car crash, police said.
 Police arrested Ashley Steadman, 27, after the 11:30 p.m. crash at the intersection of Speen Street and Superior Drive, police spokeswoman Lt. Cara Rossi said Friday.
 The crash occurred after a Toyota Tacoma stopped at a red light. The vehicle behind it, a Honda Civic, also stopped. But police say a third vehicle, a Mazda 6 driven by Steadman, did not.
 \"Car number three (Mazda) crashed into car number two (Honda) and pushed it into car number one (Tacoma),\" Rossi said.
 No one was injured, but two of the three vehicles were not operable after the crash and had to be towed, Rossi said.
 Police say that when they spoke to Steadman, it appeared she may have been under the influence of something. She admitted to police that she had three vodka drinks prior to driving, the lieutenant said.
 Steadman refused to perform a field sobriety tests or take a Breathalyzer test, meaning her license was automatically suspended for 180 days.
 Police arrested Steadman, of 6 Van Norden Road, and charged her with operating a vehicle under the influence of liquor; and driving without a license. She was also cited for failing to stop for a red light.
 After her teleconference arraignment Friday with Natick District Court, Steadman was released without bail. She is due back in court on Sept. 1 for a pretrial conference.

 This week our United States Supreme Court came down with a much-anticipated opinion that the term "sex" includes sexual orientation and transsexual status, and discrimination on those bases is likewise unlawful under Title VII.
   
 And now many left-wing liberals are dancing in the political streets while many right-wing conservatives are fuming with cries of judicial betrayal.
   
 My thoughts and observations:
   
 • This was a 6-3 decision, with Republican appointees John Roberts and Neil Gorsuch, typically considered part of the conservative bloc on the court, joining with typically considered left-leaning Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Steven Breyer, Sonia Sotomayer and Elena Kagan, in the majority. Justices Alito, Thomas and Kavanaugh dissented. Justice Gorsuch wrote the majority opinion.
   
 • In each of the consolidated cases before the court, the employers admitted that they discharged the employees in question because of their sexual orientation or transgender status. In the words of Justice Gorsuch, "(s)orting out the true reason for an adverse employment decision is often a hard business, but none of that is at issue here."
   
 Typically, in employment discrimination cases, the disputed issue is what the true reasons for the adverse employment action were, due to a reason prohibited by the anti-discrimination legislation, such as race, color, religion, sex or national origin, or some other reason unrelated to that. Not here though. This the employers admitted.
   
 • Score this a victory for the concept of the independence of the judicial branch. I believe this case demonstrates our justices are showing a well- reasoned commitment to the rule of law as they interpret it, and dispels the notion that Supreme Court justices are merely shills for the political leanings of one side or the other.
   
 Meanwhile some political figures and commentators seem to be irritated that the justices are not shills for the left of the right, but are in fact independent thinkers whose reasoning and decision-making reflects a judicial temperament free of such considerations.
   
 • Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is a federal statute, and its application is limited to employers with 15 or more employees. Thus, small companies that do not reach that number are not covered by the law and this decision in most instances. Missouri does have its own anti-discrimination laws. Six or more employees are necessary for state law anti-discrimination claims. Time will tell on what this case means for state law claims, and smaller employers.
   
 • It seems to me that the scope of the political victory for the proponents of civil rights and the defeat to disappointed conservatives is likely a lot more a matter of moral victory and defeat than it is of practical effect on the day to day lives of many. I mean, how many potential employers with 15 or more employees would legitimately put forth a true policy of employment discrimination against the LGBT world?
   
 And how many of those claiming an ugly defeat for the business community and a glorious victory for freedom will be truly affected by this decision? It's hard for me to believe the practical effect will exceed the political one.
   
 • Such bigotry seems foreign to me, particularly in an environment in which again and again I hear that the biggest challenge for any employer in business today is finding good employees who want to work, are dependable and can be trusted.
   
 To eliminate a whole class of potentially good employees in such an environment due to some bigoted attitude of intolerance over differences related to the very private issue of personal sexuality would seem a ridiculous handicap for any business to impose on itself. Still, we have laws on that. And they have been in the limelight of late.

 Summer's is officially here, though it has felt like summer for a while.
 The National Weather Service reported earlier this month that it was the second warmest spring in Lakeland and Winter Haven since temperature records were first collected in 1915 and 1941 respectively.
 The warmest springs were in 2015. Most of the top 10 warmest springs here have occurred within the past 30 years.
 Rainfall, partly aided by an early tropical storm, has given June totals a headstart.
 Weather experts are predicting a busier-than-usual hurricane season, but the annual unknown is when, where or if the storms will make it to Florida.
 Nevertheless, the rainfall seems to have overcome the drought conditions that seemed possible just a few weeks ago.
 Flow in the Peace River at Bartow has surged recently from a combination of the Peace Creek and releases from the Southwest Florida Water Management District structure on Saddle Creek south of Lake Hancock.
 That means the river has ample flow to accommodate paddling trips provided there are no fallen trees or other obstructions. I've paddled the entire river and the section in Polk County is the most scenic.
 By the way, if the rains continue as they typically do in summer in Central Florida, give your lawn irrigation system a rest. Despite recent rainfall totaling a couple of inches, I've seen sprinklers running in my neighborhood. It's a waste of water and electricity.
 Irrigation systems are supposed to have rain sensors to prevent that sort of thing, but it's anyone's guess how many do have them or have sensors installed in the right location.
 Summer is a good time to check.
 Yes, I know it's hot outside, but this is a great time to get out and do some exploring of nature.
 Native songbirds are nesting, which means they may be more visible because early in the season they are singing on territories, and throughout the nesting season they are busily foraging for food for their young.
 I'm still working on my June Challenge list, but keep getting distracted by butterfly counts and yard work. I only have 70 species, so there are still gaps.
 By next month the composition of the local bird populations will change as the first \"fall\" migrants begin arriving.
 I usually expect to see a belted kingfisher or two by July 4 and by mid-July look for migrating shorebirds in some rural fields or shallow marsh edges.
 Purple martins will be gone by the end of next month and so will many of the swallow-tailed kites.
 Migrating warblers and other songbirds begin to arrive in late July.
 I've been helping to compile a plant list on managed lands in the area and keep making an occasional unseasonable discoveries.
 I found some Garberia, a fall-flowering shrub found in scrub and sandhills, blooming already.
 The other day I saw a Dahoon holly whose berries were already red.
 Most of the plants I encountered recently were better behaved.
 One of the unpredictable parts of summer is how often the night skies will be clear enough for stargazing or watching meteor showers.
 On July 5, there will be what is known as a penumbral lunar eclipse, which will be visible over much of North America. A penumbral eclipse occurs when the moon passes across the earth's shadow. This causes the moon to darken slightly, but not to the extent that it would under a full lunar eclipse.
 July 14 will offer the best chance all year to see Jupiter and some of its larger moons. You can obviously see more detail with a decent telescope, but you should be able to pick out the planet and some moons even with a decent set of binoculars.
 On July 20, Saturn will be relatively visible. Its rings and some of its moons will be visible in a telescope.
 Finally, if you know someone who has a really good telescope, Sept. 11 will be the best chance to catch a glimpse of Neptune, which will appear as a blue dot in the sky. After all, it is 2.8 billion miles away. Jupiter and Saturn are only 397 million miles and 851 million miles away, respectively.
 This summer also will have its share of meteor showers.
 The Delta Aquarids will be visible July 28 and 29 after midnight.
 The Perseid shower, which is usually one of the best showers every year, will peak Aug. 11 and 12.
 Summer will officially end Sept. 22.
 Enjoy it while it lasts and stay healthy.

WILMINGTON — A number of updates were delivered at last Wed­nes­day’s School Commit­tee meeting related to COVID-19. The first, as part of the Superinten­dent’s Report, came in the form of a survey to gather feedback and in­formation on the possibility of in-person learning this fall.
 After that, public comments were delivered by residents or read by Dr. Brand. While supporting the School Committee, almost all of the public comments came from Wilmington parents who urged the committee to take a hard look at what things students will need in support for this year.
 “We need a robust plan put in place so that teachers and schools can educate students to a typical school year standard — the same standards that were in place for when everyone was in a classroom,” said Ur­sula Tasto.

If neither of these options are within your budget, you can still turn your backyard into a private summer oasis without breaking the bank on your “staycation.”
 If you have young children or grandchildren under the age of five, or if you are very limited in outdoor space, kiddie pools and blow up pools can still fill the bill to cool off on a hot day. These pools are very budget friendly, with a cost of $15 to $40, and with a little imagination, can be a fun summer fo­cal point in your yard.
 With the addition of a few new lawn chairs, umbrellas, outdoor lights, and maybe an inflatable palm tree or other fun decor, you can create a fun play area for the kids and a relaxing oasis for you to sit back, soak your feet and enjoy a tropical drink!
 If your kids are a little bigger, but your wallet is not, you may want to consider a temporary, blow up above ground pool. These pools come in sizes between eight and 15 feet wide and can be as deep as almost four feet. The cost range can vary from retailers, but run about $150 to $300. They are also equipped with a filter pump and require maintenance chemicals, so there is no need to change the water and the pool can stay set up for the summer months.
 Remember, all pools, besides kiddie pools, require a permit from the town. Each town has their own set of rules and regulations regarding swimming pools, so check with your town’s building department before you make any pool purchases.
 Many pools are required by town safety rules to have some type of locked fence around the pools, so keep this in mind when trying to make a budget for a new pool.
 When setting up a kiddie pool, always be sure to empty the pool every time you are done using it for safety and cleanliness purposes.
 If your family's “staycation” will be including the addition of a pool to your yard this summer, be sure to do your homework first.
 After you set a budget, be ready to make plenty of phone calls. Besides asking for referrals from friends and family, check for any complaints against the company online or through the Better Business Bureau.
 Don’t be surprised if you are put on a waiting list for a pool, as the high demand of pools this summer is causing some contractors to turn away new clients until next season.
 Even kiddie pools are becoming hard to find, and you may need to turn to the internet to find what you are looking for in a small pool.
 If all else fails, you can al­ways go “old school style” and take a run through the lawn sprinkler. It is not the same as, say... an inground pool, but it is sure to cool you off, be a fun distraction for the kids, and you probably already have one in the garage!

Standing in an alleyway by Villa Capri, Doylestown Borough Manager John Davis pointed to about 10 rectangular shapes marked with red tape on the pavement, where tables can now be set up to create safe boundaries for diners of the Italian eatery. In front, where cars once parked, staff wiped down barrel- style cafe tables adorned with flowers and covered with umbrellas.
   
 "When life gives you lemons, make limoncello," said Matt Mannino, owner of Villa Capri, setting up the outside cafe one recent day. "It feels very European."
   
 Davis said Villa Capri's new setting is an example of how business owners and borough officials are banding together, tapping into creativity and flexibility, to help merchants stay afloat.
   
 Together, they launched Operation Doylestown, an initiative to relax zoning regulations and increase support for local businesses as they open their doors, while abiding by health department guidelines. Alleyways, parking spaces and sidewalks throughout the borough have been converted for outside dining and retail sales.
   
 While creating a socially distanced experience, new outside marketplaces are sprouting up in pockets of the borough during scheduled evenings and weekends. Street closures are also being planned to allow for social distancing and safe shopping on designated days. Parking fees and open-container laws have been relaxed temporarily.
   
 "As long as a State of Emergency order is in place, we have the ability to permit some of these things to happen," said Davis, who is working with businesses to create space that meets COVID guidelines and is safe.
   
 This is not the first time borough officials, merchants and the community have stepped in to keep its downtown afloat.
   
 Davis said Operation Doylestown is born out of an historical grassroots movement "Operation 64," which united the community to preserve the borough's historic downtown in the 1960s, a time when urban renewal meant razing centuries-old structures to make way for strip malls with sprawling parking lots.
   
 Back then, the borough passed up such "urban renewal" project money offered by the government and instead turned to each other and the community to preserve its downtown. In 1964, a small group of business owners and residents worked together to prevent the demolition of Doylestown's iconic historic district.
   
 "The theme was 'self help,'" said Davis, adding that local banks offered low- interest loans and local artists painted renderings to highlight local icons. "They didn't succumb and make a mistake that was uncorrectable. They managed to keep things alive."
   
 Now, the community's embrace and support are needed once again. Last week, dozens of volunteers stepped in to help manage the borough's pop-up marketplace in the Hamilton street parking lot. Some handed out masks to shoppers, so they can safely browse the outdoor displays. Others have been busy working behind the scenes to market the event.
   
 Paul Boger, the Creative Director of Mind Your Design has been volunteering with wife, Kris Boger, on branding and promotions, as well as working closely with many small businesses.
   
 "A big part of this organization is giving back to the businesses, not taking away from them. This community has thrived on small businesses," said Boger.
   
 Area merchants are grateful for the boost and show of support.
   
 Owners of the Native Cafe, who opened their restaurant just a month before the pandemic shutdown, said both the community and the borough's zoning help have been a blessing. Customers have stayed loyal, purchasing gift cards and curbside meals, transactions made easier with the borough's designation of spots out front for customers looking to safely pick up food.
   
 "They are making it possible for us to adjust during this challenging time," said Jay Sullivan, who owns the cafe with his wife, Kate Sullivan.
   
 She was moved by one customer who bought a $150 gift card and donated it to local police. Social media reach, through Facebook and Instagram, has been a big help, she said.
   
 The experience, she said, "has been a lesson of flexibility and creativity. We were still new and so we weren't totally set in our ways; maybe we were able to adapt a little more easily because of that."
   
 Not all businesses survived. During the pandemic, at least four businesses in the borough shut down permanently, including Hickory Kitchen, Zen Den, and Dunkin' Donuts on Main Street.
   
 "They are out there with serious limitations in terms of how to go forward; they need the cooperation of the local government," said Doylestown Borough Mayor Ron Strouse. "In the context of being safe and still recognizing that we are in the middle of a pandemic, we needed to find ways to work with businesses and make sure they survive."
   
 "The most encouraging signs is the determination of these business owners," said Strouse, noting that some Zoom calls have drawn more than 60 participants. "Even though we know many are under tremendous stress in terms of the viability of their business, they are cooperative and working together."
   
 Along with providing free meals and support to healthcare workers and first- responders, owners are sharing what space they have with their neighbors.
   
 Patrick Murphy, owner of Bagel Barrel, is open for curbside pickup, but since he has 20 feet of sidewalk space and closes after 2 p.m., he offered dining space to Domoni Star, across the street.
   
 Davis said the borough will continue to brainstorm ways to continue giving support. "It will be through our own ways and from the ground up. Like Operation 64, we'll go door to door and find out what people need to stay above water and get through this."
   
 "We have to be nimble and flexible; it's a new world out there."

Perhaps the thing that amazes me the most about my years in covering sports at Red Jacket is the consistency. And the excellence.
 OK, that's 2 things.
 But for a school the size of the Manchester-Shortsville district, the continued excellence in sports across the board is something to behold. And since we've already looked back at my coverage highlights at Bloomfield, Canandaigua, Honeoye, Naples, Marcus Whitman, Midlakes and Palmyra-Macedon, today it's time for Red Jacket.
 And since 1991 was my first year as a sports writer, my earliest memories of covering sports at RJ is girls basketball because at this point, the RJ girls were a Section V force.
 I just missed the career of Courtney Romeiser before she went on to play at Marquette, but I got to see plenty of Daena Abbott, who could seemingly score at will with a jump shot that rivaled any player on any court.
 Any program would consider itself fortunate to have a player like Romeiser followed by Abbott. But the best was yet to come in Beth Record. And when I point to Record as the best, that's no disrespect to Romeiser and Abbott. But Record really was just that good.
 At 6-feet tall, Record had it all. She could post up, of course, but she didn't hesitate to put the ball on the floor from outside and drive the lane. She used her size, smarts and quickness to play at an elite level and to this day, I've never seen a female athlete at the high school level dominate the pace of play the way Record did.
 There were other sports at Red Jacket during the early 1990s, but to be quite honest, the majority of my coverage time was with the girls basketball team. Coach Bill Henry was always a pleasure to talk with during these years with the girls, but I also got to know football coach Dom Vitticore and boys basketball coach Lance Frisinger. Add wrestling coach Ray Nurse, running coach Bob Goodell and baseball coach Dave Maine and maybe it's not such a mystery as to why Red Jacket athletics were at the level they were at.
 Speaking of baseball, it was during the mid-1990s when I got to know a Red Jacket super fan at baseball games. And softball games, for that matter. We all called him Popeye, and Al Vienna was at every game he could make, setting up his lawnchair in a spot between the baseball and softball diamonds behind the school so he could watch both Red Jacket teams playing.
 It was always a highlight to see Popeye at games and chat him up. That man forgot more baseball than I'll ever know. What I recently learned about Popeye is that he had 3 brothers and all 4 of the Vienna boys had great nicknames: Smokey (Howard), Ducky (Nelson) and Smouse (Donald). What I wouldn't give to see Popeye again and ask how all those nicknames came to be.
 I missed a lot of Red Jacket sports when I worked at the Democrat and Chronicle from 1996 to 2014, so I never got to see athletes like Bailey Hixson (basketball), Kory Fogarty (football), brothers Matt and Marc Vitticore (football).
 But since 2015, there has been plenty to watch and cover. Racewalker Corrine Perry won a few Section V indoor track titles and took the time to explain the sport to me, Sean Sheets kept the strong running back tradition at Red Jacket alive (not to mention the fantastic nickname game with "Scoots"), Beth Record came back to coach the girls basketball team for a season and in 2017, I got to cover what's believed to be the first night football game at RJ.
 That game was as interesting as it was historic, because it was played against bitter rival Clyde-Savannah. And in case you were wondering where the bitterness comes from, how about C-S going for an on-side kick with 7 minutes left in a game in which it had a 33-8 lead? It was a bit surprising, to say the least, but the Indians made up for it in 2018 with a 40-26 win.
 Earlier in 2018, the Red Jacket baseball team with Tyler Liberty, Hunter Williams, Seth Gerlock and Alec Norris was part of one of the craziest baseball days for me in my career. We had 5 baseball teams from Ontario County playing for a Section V championship on the same day. I covered Red Jacket's loss to Geneseo in the Class C2 final that day in Batavia while also keeping tabs on Canandaigua (win), Midlakes (win), Victor (win) and Honeoye (loss).
 The last few years have also provided some more solid basketball for the Indians. Since my return to Canandaigua in 2015, I've never known an RJ girls team without Sydney Close, who graduated this spring, and what fun it was to watch Sara VanAken, a fantastic overall athlete who could seemingly jump out of the gym before heading off to the University of Mississippi to run track and field.
 In the fall of 2019, I watched Madalenn Fee win a Section V Class D cross- country title, only to learn after the race that it was her first year running cross-country. And speaking of cross-country, it was humbling to meet with coach Bob Goodell in his home in September of 2018. He was in the middle of battling cancer and our visit was emotional at times as we talked about his career as a running coach.
 Goodell passed away about two months after our talk and when I went to his calling hours in Manchester, it was another emotional moment to see a train of Red Jacket runners as they -- what else? -- ran from the school to the funeral home to pay respects.
 And just this past year, I was blessed to watch more than a few football games that maintained the power running game with Jarrett LeGault and Logan Keifer, but also had the exciting passing dimension with QB Matt Record and receiver Chase Rizzo. And since I love defense, I have to mention how much fun it was to watch the work of guys like Trent Coyne, Hunter FitzPatrick and Jake Anderson.
 The girls basketball team has had some nice tournament runs in recent seasons, but couldn't quite get over the hump and bring home the block. The closest they came was losing to South Seneca in the 2018 Class C2 final.
 It's the same story for the boys, who landed Trevor Gage for a coach in 2018. But the Indians lost to Lyons in the 2019 final and to Marcus Whitman earlier this year.
 But even with the losses, it's a testament to the strength of the programs, the dedication of the athletes and the leadership of the coaches for a school like Red Jacket to have annual contenders in sports across the board.
 It's always fun to cover games at Red Jacket and I have little doubt that soon enough, we'll have more championship stories to write about the Indians.

If any music genre was going to thrive in the era of quarantined livestreams, it was K-pop.
 While events like KCON and massive concert tours like BTS and SuperM have become fixtures in SoCal’s music calendar, K-pop’s life here began online and flourished in digital spaces. Fans were well-equipped to follow faraway artists and find forums to keep their community going without in-person interaction.
 But like all festivals that are down for the count this year, the loss of KCON — far and away the marquee fan event of the year in L.A. — is a blow to the local K-pop scene, which counts the days until its favorite acts come to town and fans can revel in their devotion in person.
 Enter KCON:TACT, a digital incarnation of the festival happening this weekend. True to the genre’s ultra-online culture, it doesn’t just replace the arena shows and fan panels, but also opens up other avenues for fans to stay invested, like one-on-one video conferences with acts and fan performances broadcast alongside those of idol groups.

 I missed a lot of Red Jacket sports when I worked at the Democrat and Chronicle from 1996 to 2014, so I never got to see athletes like Bailey Hixson (basketball), Kory Fogarty (football), brothers Matt and Marc Vitticore (football).
 But since 2015, there has been plenty to watch and cover. Racewalker Corrine Perry won a few Section V indoor track titles and took the time to explain the sport to me, Sean Sheets kept the strong running back tradition at Red Jacket alive (not to mention the fantastic nickname game with \"Scoots\"), Beth Record came back to coach the girls basketball team for a season and in 2017, I got to cover what's believed to be the first night football game at RJ.
 That game was as interesting as it was historic, because it was played against bitter rival Clyde-Savannah. And in case you were wondering where the bitterness comes from, how about C-S going for an on-side kick with 7 minutes left in a game in which it had a 33-8 lead? It was a bit surprising, to say the least, but the Indians made up for it in 2018 with a 40-26 win.
 Earlier in 2018, the Red Jacket baseball team with Tyler Liberty, Hunter Williams, Seth Gerlock and Alec Norris was part of one of the craziest baseball days for me in my career. We had 5 baseball teams from Ontario County playing for a Section V championship on the same day. I covered Red Jacket's loss to Geneseo in the Class C2 final that day in Batavia while also keeping tabs on Canandaigua (win), Midlakes (win), Victor (win) and Honeoye (loss).
 The last few years have also provided some more solid basketball for the Indians. Since my return to Canandaigua in 2015, I've never known an RJ girls team without Sydney Close, who graduated this spring, and what fun it was to watch Sara VanAken, a fantastic overall athlete who could seemingly jump out of the gym before heading off to the University of Mississippi to run track and field.
 In the fall of 2019, I watched Madalenn Fee win a Section V Class D cross- country title, only to learn after the race that it was her first year running cross-country. And speaking of cross-country, it was humbling to meet with coach Bob Goodell in his home in September of 2018. He was in the middle of battling cancer and our visit was emotional at times as we talked about his career as a running coach.
 Goodell passed away about two months after our talk and when I went to his calling hours in Manchester, it was another emotional moment to see a train of Red Jacket runners as they -- what else? -- ran from the school to the funeral home to pay respects.
 And just this past year, I was blessed to watch more than a few football games that maintained the power running game with Jarrett LeGault and Logan Keifer, but also had the exciting passing dimension with QB Matt Record and receiver Chase Rizzo. And since I love defense, I have to mention how much fun it was to watch the work of guys like Trent Coyne, Hunter FitzPatrick and Jake Anderson.
 The girls basketball team has had some nice tournament runs in recent seasons, but couldn't quite get over the hump and bring home the block. The closest they came was losing to South Seneca in the 2018 Class C2 final.
 It's the same story for the boys, who landed Trevor Gage for a coach in 2018. But the Indians lost to Lyons in the 2019 final and to Marcus Whitman earlier this year.
 But even with the losses, it's a testament to the strength of the programs, the dedication of the athletes and the leadership of the coaches for a school like Red Jacket to have annual contenders in sports across the board.
 It's always fun to cover games at Red Jacket and I have little doubt that soon enough, we'll have more championship stories to write about the Indians.
