A stunning 26.5 million Americans have sought unemployment benefits over the last five weeks, confirming that all the jobs gained during the longest employment boom in U.S. history have been wiped out as the novel coronavirus savages the economy. The labor market slaughter added to collapsing oil prices, retail sales, manufacturing production, homebuilding and home sales in reinforcing economists' contention that the economy entered recession in March.
 As the economic slump deepens protests have risen against nationwide lockdowns to control the spread of COVID-19, the potentially lethal respiratory illness caused by the virus. President Donald Trump, who is seeking a second term in the White House in November's general election, has been anxious to restart the paralyzed economy. Trump on Wednesday applauded steps taken by a handful of Republican-led states to begin reopening their economies, despite warnings from health experts of a potential new surge in infections.
 "Today's report shows the labor market is almost certainly pushing into new territory, jolting the unemployment rate up above the Great Recession's 10% peak and wiping out more jobs than we've gained in the recovery," said Daniel Zhao, senior economist at Glassdoor, a website recruitment firm. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 810,000 to a seasonally adjusted 4.427 million for the week ended April 18, the government said. Data for the prior week was revised to show 8,000 fewer applications received than previously reported, reducing the count for that period to 5.237 million. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims falling to 4.2 million in the latest week.
 All told, 26.453 million people have filed claims for jobless benefits since March 21, representing 16.2% of the labor force. The economy created 22 million jobs during the employment boom which started in September 2010 and abruptly ended in February this year. The Labor Department said "the COVID-19 virus continues to impact the number of initial claims."
 Last week's claims report covered the period during which the government surveyed business establishments for the nonfarm payrolls component of April's employment report. Economists are forecasting as many as 25 million jobs were lost in April after the economy purged 701,000 positions in March, which was the largest decline in 11 years. The National Bureau of Economic Research, the private research institute regarded as the arbiter of U.S. recessions, does not define a recession as two consecutive quarters of decline in real GDP, as is the rule of thumb in many countries. Instead, it looks for a drop in activity, spread across the economy and lasting more than a few months.
 WORST OVER? Though weekly jobless filings remain very high, last week's data marked the third straight weekly decline, raising hopes that the worst may be over. Weekly claims appeared to have peaked at a record 6.867 million in the week ended March 28.
 U.S. stocks opened higher as investors focused on the decline in claims. The dollar was slightly higher against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were trading lower. "While layoffs and furloughs are likely to continue across a number of industries in coming weeks, we are cautiously optimistic that the peak in layoffs following initial widespread closures has occurred," said Andrew Hollenhorst, an economist at Citigroup in New York.
 Some of the decline in claims has been attributed to a historic $2.3 trillion fiscal package, which made provisions for small businesses to access loans that could be partially forgiven if they were used for employee salaries. The U.S. Senate on Tuesday approved $484 billion in a fresh relief package, which mainly expands funding for loans to small businesses.
 With claims expected to gradually decline in the coming weeks as more small enterprises access funding, attention will shift to the number of people on unemployment benefits rolls. The so-called continuing claims data is reported with a one-week lag and is considered a better gauge of unemployment. Continuing claims jumped 4.064 million to a record 15.976 million in the week ending April 11.
 Next week's continuing claims data will offer some clues on the magnitude of the anticipated surge in the unemployment rate in April. Continuing claims have not increased at the same pace as initial jobless applications. Economists believe some people thrown out of work because of state-mandated "stay-at-home" orders found employment at supermarkets, warehouses and delivery services companies. They expect the unemployment rate will shatter the post-World War Two record of 10.8% touched in November 1982.
 The jobless rate shot up 0.9 percentage point, the largest single-month change since January 1975, to 4.4% in March. (Reporting By Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Andrea Ricci)

FY20 would not be affected much because of this. But this entire financial year we will see pain.

In the short term, my gross NPAs may be elevated, but in the long term, we will be able to pull them back. If the business starts functioning in June, it would take six to nine months from then for me to come back to my normal numbers in delinquencies. Most of the businesses can get back to 70-80 per cent of efficiency within nine months of the lockdown being lifted.

Global equity benchmarks edged higher Thursday as investors weighed an ongoing rebound in oil prices against stark economic data from Europe and the United States that further illustrated the worldwide toll from the coronavirus pandemic.
 IHS Markit's Flash Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) the European Union, seen as a good gauge of economic health, sank to by far its lowest reading since the survey began in mid-1998. In the UK, PMIs fell to a new record low in March - and far below even the weakest forecast in a Reuters poll of economists. U.S. jobless claims, meanwhile, fell to 4.427 million, a decline from 5.2 million the week before but still about 200,000 more than expected. A record 26 million Americans have sought unemployment benefits over the last five weeks.
 "While markets are going to take this drop as being very positive, it is not a victory flag that recession is going to be avoided," said Steven Blitz, chief U.S. economist at TS Lombard in New York. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.74%.following modest gains in Europe and Asia.
 In early trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 165.87 points, or 0.71%, to 23,641.69, the S&P; 500 gained 22.3 points, or 0.80%, to 2,821.61 and the Nasdaq Composite added 66.73 points, or 0.79%, to 8,562.11. Safe-haven assets like the dollar and government bonds were little changed. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 1/32 in price to yield 0.6172%, from 0.619% late on Wednesday.
 An internal EU note showed the bloc's commission was considering a plan worth 2 trillion euros ($2.2 trillion) to tackle a deep recession. An EU meeting to discuss the plan comes a day after the U.S. Congress appeared to be on course to approve nearly $500 billion more in coronavirus aid, taking the world's biggest economy's overall stimulus packages to nearly $3 trillion. "(The) EU Council meeting will be closely watched to see how quickly EU policy-makers will move towards area-wide fiscal risk-sharing," said George Cole, an economist at Goldman Sachs. "We expect the discussions to fall short of a full commitment to mutualize risks from the COVID-19 shock."
 The prospects of further stimulus measures and increasing tensions between the United States and Iran helped bolster oil prices. U.S. crude recently rose 21.19% to $16.70 per barrel and Brent was at $22.09, up 8.44% on the day.

Restaurants scrambled to find creative solutions for serving customers when the coronavirus shutdown was announced. While many are offering takeout, several restaurants decided to provide a delivery option as well. A few places are doing their own deliveries. Others are using third-party delivery apps.
 Local restaurants that offer delivery are saving customers from third-party apps’ delivery fees and higher menu prices. Using a restaurant’s delivery option means the restaurant can make more money and pass along the savings.
 Third-party delivery services — Postmates, Grubhub, Uber Eats, DoorDash, and Bend Take Out — were in place well before the shutdown. Over the past year, many restaurants took advantage of the opportunity to supplement their dine-in business by partnering with a delivery app. Some popular restaurants found that they were too busy to add to-go orders and rejected delivery. Other restaurants rejected the delivery apps because of the high commission fees.
 Restaurants operate on a thin profit margin for food. Participating restaurants may raise the prices on food that is delivered through the app to offset the 30%, or higher, commissions. The same menu item is often a few dollars less when ordered at the restaurant.
 Grubhub states its 35% commission fees are justified because restaurants are getting a higher volume of sales. During the shutdown, the company has offered little relief to restaurants, according to several Central Oregon restaurant owners. Grubhub did offer to delay commission fees, but they will be required to pay the fees at a future date.
 Jackalope co-owner Kathy Garling encourages customers to call the restaurant for direct delivery rather than use Grubhub. Unhappy with the high commissions, Garling called her insurance company and discovered that during this national emergency, she could add a driver for a small fee. Using the restaurant’s own driver had the added benefit of ensuring that the high- quality ingredients would taste their best with a faster, direct delivery.
 Joolz restaurant owner Juli Stonelake Hamden also expressed concern about how food will arrive from third-party deliveries. While Joolz still doesn’t offer delivery, Hamden said the restaurant does not want to use a delivery app to avoid “cost, set up and more hands touching the bag.” She continued, “This way (curbside pickup), we control temp and timing. It was hard to set it up, to begin with, but now it goes right into our point of sale system.”
 Wild Rose did use Postmates for a short time but quickly learned that its menu is too complicated for online ordering. Customers must call the restaurant to order. Co-owner Rosie Itti Westlund explained that Wild Rose’s food is “too different” from typical Thai food. It’s often important to describe the options to customers over the phone. “Customers can’t substitute or eliminate ingredients, as many dishes and sauces are pre-made. Some entrees are braised or stewed for a long time.”
 Aside from menu complexity, Westlund said she did not feel that the middleman delivery apps were good for restaurants. “Third-party delivery services, take gratuity that they don’t give to restaurants, and they charge an obscene commission. Delivery can get canceled before they are picked up with no protections to the restaurant owner.” These big company apps “need to be better at supporting small business restaurants.”
 Wild Rose is keeping relatively busy with the current number of takeout orders. While it can do delivery for those most at risk, it could take a long time. Where pickup can be ready in 15 minutes, a delivery can take over an hour. For those who want delivery, there is a $50 minimum and an 18% gratuity added to the order that goes to the driver. Delivery is available after 4 p.m. within the city limits.
 Boneyard Pub charges a 20% gratuity, paid to the driver, for all pub deliveries within the city limits.
 A few restaurants offer local neighborhood deliveries. Marcello’s Cucina Italiana in Sunriver provides delivery within 10 minutes of the restaurant. Pflücke Bavarian Grillhaus and Biergarten delivers in NorthWest Crossing. Niblick and Greene’s, the restaurant at Eagle Crest, delivers to those in the Eagle Crest area. Washington Dining and Cocktails offers limited delivery.
 Of the third-party delivery services, DoorDash has been the most accommodating to small restaurants during the shutdown. On April 10, the company issued a press release that it will be reducing commission fees for local restaurant partners by 50%. “This estimated $100M injection from DoorDash is dedicated to helping merchants respond to the acute financial threats they are facing right now,” the release stated.
 The delivery app company is also offering zero commission fees for 30 days to independent restaurants that are new partners. Pickup orders made through the app will also have zero commission. The waived commission fees will not need to be paid in the future.

Inslee acknowledged the “huge buy-in” from most Washington state residents following the order, saying he had trouble thinking of another time Washingtonians had shown such dedication to the health welfare of the state at large.
 Inslee said he is only aware of one instance where action at the level of Washington State Attorney General Bob Ferguson’s office had been taken on noncompliance — a property management business in Tacoma that was not following a moratorium on evictions the governor ordered last month.
 “Law enforcement really has not been necessary to do what we have to do, which is to use our heads to protect ourselves from this virus,” Inslee rsaid, though he said enforcement would be used if necessary, referring to a three- tier process for any sort of legal intervention beginning with education of the order, then moving into potential licensing or local law enforcement action.
 “Only as a very last resort do we have to seek legal action to obtain compliance,” Inslee said about the third step.
 Inslee said he had sent a letter to the Franklin County commissioners, who approved a resolution this week in defiance of the “Stay Home, Stay Healthy” order, citing constitutional and state law. He said the letter “made clear that those actions really intentionally and knowingly violated the state law, and so they’ll have to change.”
 Inslee added that individual law enforcement department leaders cannot “arbitrarily decide which laws they are going to enforce, and which laws they are not going to enforce.”
 “If people have disagreements with the law, that can be decided by the courts, not by any individual law enforcement officer,” Inslee said. He mentioned Snohomish County Sheriff Adam Fortney specifically after the sheriff had said he would not enforce the “Stay Home, Stay Healthy” order, calling it a “suspension of constitutional rights.”

 "Our role is to protect the players and coaches. We've informed the various teams on the measures to curb the spread of the disease and now we have decided to pay out some money directly to those involved in the most transparent manner.
 "Football is a uniting sport and in such a difficult period, there should be more solidarity.''

 In a press release, Fecafoot stated that 25 players and coaches will be retained per a men's team, while 20 players per outfit from the women's championship will benefit from the gesture.
 However, this disparity in the number of players selected per team has sparked some discussion, with some accusing Fecafoot of undermining women's football.
 "We arrived at the figures after having discussed with the presidents of the men and women's leagues," Njoya added.
 "With the women's championship, it was discovered that due to limited resources, some teams start the championship with fewer players. Only a handful have a roster of about 18 players unlike in the men's championship where some teams begin the season with as many as 30 players.
 "It is the reality of our sport but we want to develop women's football and give it a similar standing as the men's league.
 "Each team will receive $2000 and for us, this is the first step in a series of measures that are aimed at helping the players of the domestic championship during this difficult period," he says.
 "We also have plans of extending this to the amateur championships but we want to do something that will have a very significant impact in the lives of the players."
 A project to distribute food, sanitisers, protective face masks and other items to footballers across the country is also on the cards, but there are growing concerns the coronavirus pandemic could herald an economic depression that will greatly affect the sport in Cameroon.
 "Fifa and Caf have been assisting us but we need more means. We have limited resources at the moment and we feel we may be in for a greater challenge in the months ahead.
 "There are so many uncertainties in this dramatic situation and we are thinking about different scenarios but most of our sponsors are affected.
 "Our major partners are all suffering as a fallout of this pandemic and even though we know things may be hard for our sport, we want to stay positive and hope there can be a ray of hope in this" Njoya concluded.
 Part of the fallout of the pandemic has been the indefinite postponement of the African Nations Championships, also known as CHAN, which was due to be held in Cameroon this April.
 "It is too early to determine the date of the next edition of the CHAN, whether in 2020 or 2021 - the only thing that seems clear, is that the tournament will not be held in Cameroon in June and July, due to climatic conditions," CAF President Ahmad Ahmad, told French newspaper Le Monde.

Online school-I'm probably in the minority here, but I've been preaching for years to anyone who'd listen that our school system is antiquated. We need to take the time to come up with something better than we've been thrown into, but don't go back to cramming our kids into buildings together where they are sitting ducks for bullies, gunmen, and now for virus spreading. It is not a good system for learning regardless of health and safety.

Už se ale samozřejmě taky těší, až se vrátí ke své původní profesi. „Uvidíme, jak se bude situace vyvíjet. Je jasné, že nejdřív budou povoleny menší koncerty a vystoupení pro uzavřenou společnost (s kapelou Joybox). Největší radost mám ale z koncertů, na nichž hrajeme autorskou hudbu. Ať už jsou to ty s Ondrou Brzobohatým nebo klubové s kapelou Atomic Gigolo, protože jsou výjimečné samy o sobě. A taky se těším, až se uvidím se svými žáky ‚face to face‘, protože to nelze ničím nahradit. Online výuka má bezesporu taky svoje výhody, například v tom, že se děti naučí práci s novými médii při natáčení vlastního hraní. A to jim pak slouží jako nastavené zrcadlo. Na překlenovací období je online výuka fajn,“ dodává Matouš Kobylka.

Video of arguments seems like a non-starter. No justice is on record as backing cameras in the Supreme Court, and several have backtracked from their confirmation hearings when they said they were open to the idea. But neither has any current justice been as vehement as retired Justice David Souter, who said in 1996 that "the day you see a camera come into our courtroom, it's going to roll over my dead body."
