The reigning world champion was further asked if he had the chance of winning only one race which one would it be? Alaphilippe didn't even think twice and made the choice very clear saying, &quot;After winning the World Championships, I would definitely like to win the Tour de France. It's the two races that have always made me dream. If there was only one race to win, it would be the Tour.&quot;

Of course, there's a good chance you won't be able to claim that presumably limited special offer if you're not fast (and lucky) enough, so it might be wise to settle for the $60 discount available right now at Woot. The Amazon- owned e-tailer will hook you up with a standard 1-year Apple warranty if you decide to beat the holiday rush, although you can also opt for an even cheaper pair of AirPods Pro backed by a 90-day seller warranty.
   
 We're talking "grade A" refurbished units priced at $174.99, but unfortunately, Woot doesn't provide any additional details on the condition of these particular earbuds. We're pretty sure grade A means that the deeply discounted AirPods Pro look essentially as good as new while working flawlessly to deliver your favorite tunes without letting your surroundings mess up your listening experience.
   
 Apart from state-of-the-art active noise cancellation technology, these puppies have excellent overall audio quality going for them, as well as a battery life of more than 24 hours (when taking the bundled wireless charging case into consideration), impeccable iOS integration, and a sweat and water- resistant design.

The latest killer deal comes from Woot, dropping the $249 MSRP of the world's most popular high-end true wireless earbuds to a measly $189.99 in brand-new condition. The AirPods Pro have never been cheaper than this, mind you, but the best AirPods Black Friday deals are obviously yet to come, and we already know Walmart plans to go all the way down to $169 starting November 25.

Across Africa, where the vast majority of protected areas already operate on a shoestring budget, similar scenarios are playing out. The pandemic has laid bare what conservationists have been warning of for years: that support for Africa’s nature is grossly inadequate. But rather than just highlighting and exacerbating this fact, many experts believe that COVID-19 presents a unique opportunity to completely revamp the way the world approaches conservation in Africa, which is currently almost entirely reliant on the fickle tides of tourism and the whims of donors. Through the fog of struggle and loss, conservationists see a chance to rebuild the status quo into something that is significantly more self-sustaining, resilient, and equitable.

Such changes are necessary not just for Africa’s protected areas and people, but for all of us. The economy, experts agree, is not a valid argument against investing in the future of our planet. In the short term, Tear points out, there are “massive funds” available globally that could be better coordinated to cover the costs of changing our ways, and those investments would very quickly pay off. According to a report published in September by the Paulson Institute and the Nature Conservancy, the world would have to spend $598 to $824 billion annually over the next 10 years to stop the impending extinction crisis, reduce the risk of future pandemics, and maintain ecosystem integrity in Africa and beyond. It might sound like a lot, but compare that to the at least $2.6 trillion that the COVID-19 pandemic has so far cost humanity—a figure that may wind up ballooning to up to 10 times more, according to a recent _Science_ opinion piece.

Indeed, whether protected areas are managed by governments, non-profit groups, individuals, or companies, involving local communities is key to long-term success. This is necessary from both an ethical and practical standpoint. Living near a protected area can come with steep costs in terms of land that is not available for use and danger posed by animals that can kill people and livestock, and consume or trample a year’s worth of crops overnight. If an impoverished rural community does not reap any benefit from a nearby protected area, they will often come to resent it. They may target it for illegal activities—or look the other way if they see a neighbor doing so.
