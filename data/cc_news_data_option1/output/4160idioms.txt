Local politicians and the Government are at loggerheads over the level of financial support Greater Manchester would get if it is forced to accept the most severe coronavirus restrictions - a disagreement that has so far prevented the region from being moved into Tier 3.
 And senior Tories warned Number 10 that there is now a growing rebellion on its own backbenches over the bid by ministers to encourage more areas to accept the most stringent measures.
 Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham, in an impassioned press conference, accused the Government of treating the North "with contempt" and of trying to make it the "sacrificial lamb" for unproven measures that were being carried out "on the cheap".

Not that he seemed too concerned. He downplayed the matchup and shifted the focus to what the Vikings have to do to have success.
 “They’ve got nice deep threats in Julio and Calvin, and we are just going to have to limit those guys,” Gladney said. “Take the deep shots away and we should be straight.”
 While he’s definitely oversimplifying the position on the surface, and refusing to say too much during interviews, Gladney hasn’t lost any of his confidence. His teammates seem to appreciate that.
 “He’s getting better every game,” rookie receiver Justin Jefferson said. “It’s still early in the season, and we are still learning and we are still picking up on different things. I think the more we play, the more we see, and he’s been doing a great job just picking up on different stuff. I’m excited to see what he has down the road.”

Both young QBs might be falling out of favor with their current teams. The Jets could jettison Darnold, the 2018 No. 3 overall pick, and start over in 2021 with another young QB. They are bad enough to win the Trevor Lawrence sweepstakes. Washington went through a regime change since picking Haskins No. 15 overall in 2019 and he, too, could be on his way out after an unproductive start.
 At worst, these young QBs would serve as functional backups. At best, they would develop into potential successors to Kirk Cousins if his production and that relationship go downhill.

“I really loved the communication of our guys,” Cassellius said. “I felt like our offensive line was on the same page, and I think that’s probably the most important thing is making sure all five or six or seven are stepping together, blocking the same and all that stuff. That to me is super exciting and then obviously, too, leaders up there stepping up and helping out the young guys. It was just great to see, and they are going to continue to improve every week.”
