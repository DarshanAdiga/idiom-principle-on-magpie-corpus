EA surprise-released the first instalment of its critically-acclaimed Titanfall series on Steam yesterday, but less than 24 hours later, the game is sporting an ominous "mixed" user score on Valve's PC client owing to technical woes preventing players from connecting to the servers.
 Complaints chiefly concern matchmaking. Some people report that the game refuses to match them with other players, stating they haven't got the right DLC maps installed when they have, while others say they can't connect at all - which is problematic, given Titanfall has no singleplayer content.

 Others report issues with the audio installer, which reviewer "swaggy p" on Steam says is "super loud static" that "ruins the experience".
 Some later reviews, however, insist the issues have now been rectified, but even recent feedback continue to report that connectivity and audio issues persist.
 "Had a rocky first day, but all issues were swiftly patched," reported Fresh Pancake (thanks, _Eurogamer_). "Titanfall 1 has several significant differences from 2, and a lot of the community still prefers 1. Absolutely worth buying if you love 2, and if you like fast paced shooters its a great game in general."
 ICYMI, _Apex Legends_' latest map, _Olympus, originally began life in Titanfall 3_.
 "At one point, there was a Titanfall 3 in the works after we launched Titanfall 2," said Apex Legends game director Chad Grenier, explaining the origins of the map. "And Olympus wasn't called Olympus at the time, but that style of map was something that we were exploring for the next Titanfall game."
 Grenier delves into detail on the scrapped Titanfall 3, saying that while they were "building Titanfall, we sort of discovered this battle royale game mode within that." This battle royale mode would turn into Apex Legends, which the team would then choose to work on over more Titanfall.

It was in 2014 when Streb closed with a 63 to make up a five-shot deficit before winning a three-man playoff. Six players were within five shots of the lead going into Sunday.
 Even with no spectators and only limited corporate clients allowed, Johnson will feel an entire community behind. He lives at Sea Island, and no resident has ever won this event. Winless since the 2015 British Open at St. Andrews, Johnson rallied late with three birdies over his last five holes, finishing with a 30-foot birdie putt.
 Burgoon had five birdies in a six-hole stretch on the back nine — the exception was a bogey on the 14th, playing straight into a strong wind along the water — to overcome a rough start and get into the final group.
 Emiliano Grillo had a65 and was four shots behind, while Kevin Kisner (66) and Kyle Stanley (68) were five back.
 Streb began his round with a quick hook and escaped trouble with par. From the left side of the second fairway, 123 yards to a back pin and facing the wind, he left it on the front of the green and had to two-putt from 75 feet. He came up well short of the green on the par-3 third and had to get up-and-down from 65 meet, making an 8-foot par putt.
 “It wasn’t the greatest start, but got out of there with a bunch of pars and tried to find some consistency and it got better,” Streb said.
 It never felt easy, but he wasn't losing any ground. He made his first birdie with a sand wedge to 3 feet on No. 8, and the rest of the round was relatively stress-free except for a couple of more two-putts from 50 feet or longer.

We’ve just got to get there. Let’s make sure that we work hard to protect one another, make sure our most vulnerable are there to get the vaccine. So mask up, follow these steps we’re taking the next three weeks and let’s stop this growth of the coronavirus.”Top counties with the most positive cases Saturday were reported in Jefferson, Fayette, and Warren. Counties seeing the greatest number of new cases were reported in Jefferson, Fayette, Oldham, Boyd, and Hardin.Those reported lost to the virus Saturday include a 43-year-old, 72-year-old, and 83-year-old men from Jefferson County; a 67-year-old and a 73-year old woman, both from Jefferson County; a 79-year- old man from Bullitt County; an 80-year-old man from Carter County; a 79-year- old woman from Monroe County; a 73-year-old, 75-year-old, and 90-year old woman, all from Pike County, and an 80-year-old man from Pike County; a 76-year-old and 91-year-old from Madison County; an 86-year-old and 90-year- old man from Jessamine County; a 58-year-old man from Barren County; a 75-year-old man from Lewis County; an 87-year-old and 92-year-old man from McCracken County; and a 94-year-old woman from McLean County.To view the full daily report, incidence rate map, testing locations, long-term-care and other congregate facilities update, school reports, the White House Coronavirus Task Force reports for Kentucky and other key guidance, click here.Copyright 2020 WAVE 3 News.

"Our hearts are broken," interim La Vergne Police Chief Chip Davis said in a statement. "Our K9s are members of the LPD family. Sjaak was an amazing and loyal dog. We ask everyone to keep Officer Darby, his family, and all of the La Vergne officers in your thoughts and prayers as we deal with this loss."
 Sjaak is the first line of duty death for the department, according to its statement.
 The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation is investigating the incident. According to a TBI statement, Darby has just left a police station when a vehicle pulled along the passenger side and the driver fired shots into the patrol car.
 Darby and other officers pursued the driver, who pulled into a residential complex, exited his vehicle and began shooting at the officers, who returned fire, according to the TBI.

Those raucous crowds of shoppers who emerge on the day after Thanksgiving are the lifeblood of some retailers. The day is called Black Friday on the theory that only in the holiday season do some store owners move from the red ink to the black and start turning a profit for the year.
 But this year, crowds mean outbreaks, and COVID-19 seems to be spreading fast without any holiday help. As of Saturday, 113 people were dead of the virus in Calhoun County, with more than 5,900 people infected and new cases emerging faster than they did in the summer virus surge.
 Even so, Dennis said, the numbers so far are surprisingly good. According to a Retailers Association survey, she said, 42 percent of people in the state said they’d started their holiday shopping early. By the end of September, those shoppers had spent 8 percent more than the year before.
 Bill Wakefield, owner of the Anniston-based Wakefield’s clothing store chain, said he’s seen business come back, some of it online but much of it in person. He’s even managed to open a new store in Gadsden during the pandemic.
 The biggest problem right now, Wakefield said, was the one he predicted in spring. Manufacturers cut back on production earlier in the year, expecting less demand.
 “The suppliers place their bets early on, and now they don’t have enough product,” he said.
 State officials earlier this month lifted restrictions that required stores to keep crowds at their stores down to half of their normally allowed occupancy. Wakefield said he’s keeping occupancy limits at his store.
 Some consumers shopped early to avoid crowds, Dennis said. And some businesses, even small ones, learned to step up their efforts to sell online.
 “Many retailers have moved ahead with changes they’d been putting off for years,” Dennis said.
 Tom Moore, of Lucy’s Toys on Alabama Highway 9 east of Anniston, has lived through some of those changes.
 A family business, the store has sold handmade puppets, blankets and plush toys since the 1960s. Walk-in customers were rare, but the Moores made sales through word of mouth, and traveled to arts and crafts fairs nearly every weekend — until 2020.
 “All of our shows have been canceled,” Moore said. At first, he said, it wasn’t a problem, since most of the store’s sales took place in fall and winter. Moore said he’d hoped the virus would clear up by fall. But just last week he got a call announcing that one of the few remaining events on the schedule, a show in Virginia, was being canceled.

David Charles Olson      David Charles Olson, loving husband, father, brother, and son passed away peacefully with his wife by his side on Monday, October 26, 2020 in Thousand Oaks, California. Strong in stature and spirit to the end, the Lord called him home after a life well lived at the age of 87.      David was born on June 25th, 1933 in Lincoln, Nebraska to Carl Wilhem and Charlotte Angela Joyce Olson. He was the first of three children with brother Samuel (Sam) Olson and sister Carolyn (Carrie) Olson Lamphere. Known as Duff/Duffy to family and friends, Dave to co-workers, Gramps to his beautiful grandchildren and great grandchildren, he inspired all that knew him with his loyalty, hard-work, ingenuity, and thoughtfulness.      Born into a third-generation construction family, who knew that this tall, Swedish, left-handed, basketball loving, engineer would meet his future wife, Agnes (Aggie) Anderson at Irving Jr. High School in 9th grade. He attended Shattuck Military Academy in Faribault, Minnesota but returned to graduate from Lincoln High School his senior year. He received a four-year NROTC Navy scholarship and attended the University of Nebraska earning dual degrees in Architecture and Civil Engineering. In one momentous day on February 4th, 1956 he received his Navy stripes in the morning, graduated from UNL in the afternoon and married the love of his life that evening. Their commitment lasted 64 years strong.      While in the navy, the newly married couple stationed in Newport, Rhode Island. David served with the Sixth Fleet as a gunnery officer aboard the USS William R. Rush destroyer, which protected the Suez Canal and surrounding areas of the Mediterranean during the Suez crisis. After completing his military service, they returned to Lincoln where David joined Olson Construction. During a steel strike in Nebraska, David and his growing family moved to California to pursue other construction opportunities. Work was plentiful in California with notable projects being Berkeley's Lawrence Hall of Science, Stanford University's Law School building, the Brundage wing of the DeYoung Museum in San Francisco, and the Bank of America building in San Diego. He was proud to build the Sheldon Art Gallery on the U of Nebraska campus as well. David became the President of Olson Construction and moved back to Lincoln. O.C.C. had operations in 26 states, was the 2nd largest builder of hospitals and one of the largest general engineering contractors in the United States. David traveled continuously between eight offices in the central and western U.S. While living in San Diego, David bought a defunct parcel of land in Windsor, California north of Santa Rosa. He planted grapes on the property to hopefully earn enough to pay the property tax. This decision began David's next career as a grape grower. He enrolled in Santa Rosa Jr. college and with the help of other farmers, learned how to grow fine quality Chardonnay, Gewürztraminer, and Syrah grapes. With his entrepreneurial spirit, he was excited to try new grafting, trellising and growing techniques. Often, students from UC Davis would tour his vineyards and study his success. Modestly he would say, "This soil is so fertile, I could plant a pencil and it would grow an eraser". David's thoughtful decisions and lasting legacy continue to be a blessing to his family and communities wherever he served.      Being on the move was a constant theme in David and Aggie's life. The locations of the birth of their three children are an indication of their movement: Charles John Olson (Chad) in Newport, RI, Christopher David Olson (Chip) in Lincoln, NE and Emily Elizabeth Olson Hill in Redwood City, CA. Duff and Aggie also lived in the beautiful communities of Menlo Park, Atherton, San Diego, Windsor, Healdsburg, Ojai and Thousand Oaks, keeping enduring friendships along the way. He was actively involved with Rotary, Delta Tau Delta fraternity, AGC, YPO, Boy Scouts, Menlo Atherton High School, The Bishops School, Dry Creek Valley Association, Ojai Music Festival and the #1 fan at his family's sporting events and activities. David helped in the formation and incorporation of the City of Windsor. David had a deep and abiding faith in Christ, often serving as a loyal volunteer at Good Shepard Lutheran Church. He loved to fish, follow Cornhusker football, listen to country music, and tell stories often bringing tears to his eyes. His energy never subsided even when fighting prostate cancer. One of his final sentences was "Let's Go".      David is survived by his wife, Agnes, his three children and spouses; Chad & Denise Olson, Chip & Kathy Olson, Emily & Spencer Hill, his eleven grandchildren and spouses with four great grandchildren; Lindsey & Benjamin Frehner, Andrew & Kelsey Olson with Sadie Ann, Carl Olson, Emma Olson, Camille & Adam Henningsen with Dawson Charles and Emelia Fey, Chloe Olson, Lauren & Rick Weipking with Avery Rose, Lindsay & Mark Karwowski, Preston Hill, Anderson Hill, and Spencer Hill III, all of whom David was "Mighty Proud".      We are deeply grateful to all the nurses and staff at University Village in Thousand Oaks, Oak View Skilled Nursing and Assisted Home Hospice for their loving patience, care, and loving hearts during his final years. The family will celebrate David's life at a later date. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the Alzheimer's Association at www.alz.org.      Living a life always on the move, David will rest peacefully next to family in Lincoln, Nebraska. He always said, "There is nothing in life more important than family" and we are grateful he will have an eternal home in Heaven.      Condolences online at Roperandsons.com.

DULUTH — When the final round of the LOCALiQ Series began, David Pastore trailed Trace Crowe by a shot.
 Early in his back nine, Pastore had stormed ahead by four shots and looked to be cruising. By the end of the day, all he could do was watch to see if there would be a playoff. When Crowe missed a 12-foot birdie putt that would have left the two tied, Pastore had the title that had eluded him all season, capturing the season-ending LOCALiQ Series Championship at TPC Sugarloaf by the narrowest of margins.
 The win pushed Pastore into the second spot on the season-long points list, and he earned a playing spot in the PGA TOUR’s 2021 Barbasol Championship by virtue of his victory. Crowe, a non-International Tour member, had a runner-up finish and a tie for fourth in only three Series starts.

Things that were awkward for the crowd of volunteers in April — like wearing masks and avoiding handshakes — are now second nature. Victory’s pastor, Charles Gregory, said volunteers will go to the city’s public housing communities to distribute the meals.
 “We’re trying to go to some areas where people might not be able to get out to get it,” Gregory said. “Want we’re going to prearrange with some of them to come to the church and get it.”
 Gregory and Wakefield said volunteers would distribute “a word and a bird” — the “word” being Psalm 107:1. “O give thanks unto the Lord for He is good,” the verse reads. “For His mercy endureth forever.”
 In April, Gregory and the volunteers invited people to a virtual Easter service via Facebook. Today, Victory Headquarters is again holding church in person, in addition to Facebook Live events.
 So far, Gregory said, finding the room for social distancing at those services hasn’t been a problem.
 “We never have a really large crowd, because most of our people now follow us online,” Gregory said.

At last month’s virtual G2E expo, Bill Miller, president and chief executive officer, American Gaming Association (AGA) spelled out a case for continued progress on the road to recovery, citing statistics that demonstrated the durability of the demand for brick-and-mortar casino gaming and creative approaches to testing for COVID-19 in both the tribal and commercial sectors.
 Unity was the third leg of the stool. “We’re united; unity creates strength and it deepens our influence,” he said. “We saw this at work with the CARES Act back in March. During the past natural or man-made disasters, Congress and the federal government explicitly excluded gaming from economic relief. When other industries were offered a helping hand, gaming was given a cold shoulder. Many policymakers and commentators called for the same treatment in the CARES Act. We made the case that gaming was a pillar in our communities all across the country and that our workers should be entitled to the same compassion as millions of others in America. That small business depending on gaming should not be allowed to fail. And for the first time ever, gaming received federal relief to keep workers on the payroll, to access critical capital to provide stabilization funds to tribal governments, and to give direct economic support to gaming workers and their families. Now that we’ve broken through, we will never accept discriminatory treatment from Washington again.”
 Miller added that industry unity will enable it to hit the ground running regardless of which party controls Congress or the White House. “More importantly, we have a focused agenda that unites our industry. One of our top priorities is to continue to build gaming champions in Washington to help us achieve our legislative goals. And that work starts with the congressional gaming caucus. Our recent success in Washington would not have been possible without the revival of the bipartisan caucus late last year under the leadership of Representatives Dina Titus (D-NV) and Guy Reschenthaler (R-PA).”

Still, this victory feels cut from the same cloth as LSU’s 17-16 win in 2017 at Florida. A win that came a week after that still infamous 24-21 loss at home to Troy. A win that kept the Tigers’ season from careening out of control and put LSU on pace for a return trip to the Citrus Bowl.
 It remains to be seen whether this win can be all that for the now 3-3 Tigers, who still have road games with Texas A&M and Florida and (maybe) a home date with Alabama still on the schedule. It’s a win in which you take the pieces that help you and discard the rest on the large pile of moments and mishaps that LSU wants to forget about this 2020 season.
 “I’m happy for our football team,” coach Ed Orgeron said at the end of a trying week that included disturbing allegations of mishandled sexual assault claims against his program and his school. “We needed this win.
 “We needed a break. These guys fought hard.”
 Fight was something much lacking from the Tigers the last time they took the field on Halloween afternoon at Auburn. After battling those Tigers to a scoreless first-quarter draw, LSU turned pumpkin in an embarrassing 48-11 defeat.
 No reason for such blushes for LSU in this one. Oh for sure, the Tigers gave up a host of big plays, six of them for 29, 29, 50, 50, 51 and 65 yards, accounting for 274 of Arkansas’ 443 yards total offense.
 But the Tigers also did a lot of things they haven’t done most of the season, basic things like sealing the edges and tackling effectively and, yes, defending passes. LSU held Arkansas to seven three-and-outs plus a third-down interception that linebacker Jabril Cox snatched at the Razorbacks’ 37 that he returned to the 1 to set up a Ty Davis-Price touchdown run.

Moore said younger members of the family have been pushing their products on social media instead.
 “We had always planned on doing more online,” he said. “But you get stuck on this treadmill, saying ‘I’ll get to that, I’ll get to it.’”
 Reilly Johnson, director of Main Street Anniston, said many downtown businesses have taken to online sales, too, hosting online auctions to attract attention and allowing people to schedule shopping times to avoid crowds.
 Main Street this year is again promoting Small Business Saturday, a yearly event intended to remind shoppers to support local businesses during their holiday shopping. She said she has high hopes for the event despite the pandemic, because people are aware of the toll COVID has taken on small businesses.
 “I think people will rally around them the way they rallied around our restaurants earlier this year,” she said.
 Anniston this week canceled its downtown Christmas parade due to COVID concerns. Johnson said that may not hurt downtown businesses as much as one might think, because many of those businesses close before the late-evening parade typically begins.
 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention this week urged people to rethink their Thanksgiving travel plans in light of the pandemic. Johnson said it’s hard to tell what effect that could have on shopping.
 “A lot of people travel out of town on Thanksgiving,” Johnson said. “Hopefully, if they stay, they’ll shop at local businesses.”
 A near-total shutdown of shopping, of the sort the state saw in April, could change the picture entirely. Still, there are indications that a shutdown isn’t likely, even if the spread of the virus continues to accelerate.
 Gov. Kay Ivey earlier this month lifted restrictions that required businesses to operate at no more than 50 percent of their maximum occupancy — a move that drew criticism from some who said it could contribute to spread of the virus. On Wednesday, Ivey tweeted that she “will not shut down businesses.”
 Some local business owners are betting that a brighter future will come soon. Robbie Whitman opened a small gift shop called Moon near the Jacksonville Public Square in October.
 She said social distancing hasn’t been a challenge, because there’s rarely more than one customer at a time. Finding suppliers who can deliver merchandise has been more difficult, she said.
 As for how the pandemic will affect holiday business, she said, it’s hard to say.
 “I don’t really know what to expect,” she said.

All of these make the traditional Thanksgiving celebrations a danger, especially with case numbers and positivity rates what they are. Marking the holiday as usual could mean inviting the virus into your homes and to your table.
 For plenty of people, who have struggled through this pandemic and continue to face tremendous hardship, the loss of Thanksgiving may seem too great. They are intent on celebrating this holiday as before, consequences be damned.
 Virginia isn’t going to stop them. Not really.
 Gov. Ralph Northam imposed tighter restrictions on the commonwealth which took effect on Nov. 15, but said on Wednesday that he doesn’t intend to further reduce the limit on gatherings from 25 or to prohibit travel, as many other states have done.
 Northam said the state would step up enforcement of its mask ordinance and hold people accountable for large gatherings, but law enforcement isn’t likely to crash your dinner if there are 26 people there.
 Instead, the governor has left it up to us, urging Virginians to make smart decisions without further government intrusion.
 “This is in your hands, Virginia. You know what to do,” he said Wednesday. “And if you do the right thing ... we’ll be able to move forward.”
 The governor knows, as public health officials have reported, that family gatherings are likely driving the spread of COVID-19 in parts of the commonwealth, particularly in southwest Virginia.

Even with no spectators and only limited corporate clients allowed, Johnson will feel an entire community behind. He lives at Sea Island, and no resident has ever won this event. Winless since the 2015 British Open at St. Andrews, Johnson rallied late with three birdies over his last five holes, finishing with a 30-foot birdie putt.

ST. SIMONS ISLAND, Ga. (AP) — Robert Streb kept his game from coming undone over the first hour Saturday, and then pieced together enough birdies for a 3-under 67 to build a three-shot lead going into the final round of the RSM Classic.
 Streb came from five shots behind when he won at Sea Island six years ago, his only PGA Tour title. This time, he has a lead over Zach Johnson (65) and Bronson Burgoon (67).
 Streb was at 17-under 195.
 Camilo Villegas pulled within one shot on the lead going to the back nine of the Seaside course until a two-shot swing at the 10th that cost him momentum. Streb hit his approach to 8 feet for birdie. Villegas was just on the fringe 15 feet away, ran it by 5 feet and missed that to fall three shots back.
 Villegas added a bogey on the 13th, didn't make a birdie on the back nine and had to settle for a 70. He was five shots behind as he tries to win for the first time since five years, and following a summer in which his 2-year-old daughter died of tumors on her brain and spine.
 Streb had to earn back his full PGA Tour card a year ago, and then missed the PGA Tour postseason for the third straight year. He kept his status because of the pandemic-shortened year, and a victory Sunday would give him an exemption through August 2023.
 Even so, he knows from experience not to look too far ahead.

The Committee has said that given the reports of “private hospitals charging exorbitant medical fees” that were beyond the reach of many, “free Covid treatment under PMJAY could provide a sigh of relief to the entitled beneficiaries and the economically weaker sections of the society”. It has recommended to “the Ministry to constantly make efforts to minimise the out of pocket expenditure of patients due to Covid and update the details of the beneficiaries on the scheme's IT System”.

Few would argue that COVID-19 stay-at-home orders and an ongoing prohibition against large gatherings have had a tremendous impact on all aspects of the gaming industry.
 Across the board, casinos, operators, slot machine suppliers and those that maintain them were all feeling the effects of a sudden and complete halt of gaming activity. These businesses were forced to reevaluate 2020 plans, and many turned to furloughing staff and other cost-saving measures. Many planned installs for casinos were reconsidered, and dollars devoted to them were reinvested into safety solutions and data collection.

The Maximum Pressure campaign against the Iranian regime continues to be extraordinarily effective. Today, Irans economy faces a currency crisis, mounting public debt, and rising inflation. Prior to the Maximum Pressure campaign, Iran was exporting nearly 2.5 million barrels of oil per day. Now it struggles to export even a quarter of that volume. Since May 2018, we have denied the regime of direct access to more than $70 billion in oil revenue, and will continue to prevent the regime access to around $50 billion annually. The Iranian rial has depreciated to one fifth of its former value against the dollar since the start of the campaign, while Irans GDP has shrunk by around 6% for three consecutive years.

A familiar face is set to return to Kansas City.
 The Chiefs are expected to sign guard Stefen Wisniewski to the practice squad once he clears COVID-19 protocols with a view to eventually elevate him to the active 53-player roster, a source with knowledge of the situation confirmed Saturday with The Star.
 Wisniewski arrived Friday night in Kansas City, the source added.
 The 6-foot-3, 305-pound Wisniewski originally joined the Chiefs in late October 2019 before being inserted in the starting lineup at left guard in late December.
 A physical player at the point of attack, Wisniewski went on to start all three playoff games, including the Super Bowl, for the Chiefs last season before leaving in free agency after signing a two-year deal with the Pittsburgh Steelers.
