"articleBody": "When discussing the intellectual circles of the Tanzimat era in the 19th century, many people would mention names such as Mustafa Fazıl Pasha, Namık Kemal, Ibrahim Şinasi, Ziya Pasha, Ebuzziya Mehmed Tevfik and Ali Suavi, most of whom were members of the Young Ottomans group. The Young Ottomans, officially known as the New Ottomans Association, was a group of young intellectual bureaucrats who were trying to conceptualize the new constitutional Ottoman state to save it from decline. That is, the association, led and sponsored by Mustafa Fazıl Pasha, was a secret club of intellectuals aimed at finding a solution to the state&#39;s crisis. The great poets and thinkers Namık Kemal and Ziya Pasha were among the members of the association, as well as Ali Suavi, a very colorful and controversial revolutionary.

Münif Pasha was born “Mehmet Tahir” in 1830 in Aintab sanjak (today’s southeastern Gaziantep province) to Abdülhadi Efendi, a madrasah instructor. He was first schooled in Nuruosmaniye Madrasas in Aintab before he moved to the Kasr-ı Ali Madrasah in Cairo, where his father was officially transferred. His father and friends taught him Arabic, and he learned Persian from an Iranian native speaker and scholar named Mirza Senklahdam. Furthermore, he began to study French.

Bulgaria’s demands for the talks to begin include the former Yugoslav republic acknowledging that the roots of its language are Bulgarian. Launching accession talks with a prospective member country requires unanimous approval from all 27 EU nations. Foreign Minister Ekaterina Zaharieva told Bulgaria’s lawmakers that their country withheld its consent last Tuesday because North Macedonia was not observing a 2017 bilateral friendship treaty and was fueling hatred through some of its policies.

The question of police violence in France has become mainstream since the yellow vest protests. On Monday, French police were filmed tossing migrants out of tents while evacuating a makeshift camp in the French capital, leading to accusations of excessive force. Police used tear gas to remove migrants from a camp set up in central Paris. Prosecutors have opened probes into the use of violence against both a journalist and a migrant in that incident. On Tuesday night, protesters took to the streets to show support for asylum- seekers and to denounce police violence and an unwelcoming policy toward migrants in France.

The French government has been under growing pressure to address long-running accusations of excessive violence by police, particularly against minorities. Some Black Lives Matter protests broke out in Paris in June, a month following the death of Floyd after a white police officer knelt on his neck in the street for nearly nine minutes in the course of arresting him. The outrage generated by Floyd&#39;s death has resonated in France, in particular in deprived city suburbs where police often clash with youth from ethnic minority backgrounds. The protests in Paris in June focused on unsolved cases of people dying during police operations, such as Adama Traore, who died in police detention near Paris in 2016. Young people in French working-class suburbs with a large immigrant population have long complained of police violence, with an upsurge in complaints during the first coronavirus lockdown earlier this year. Racist comments allegedly made by police officers in a Facebook group also sparked outrage.",

He was also an archetypical example of educational modernists. According to him, the revival and progress of the Ottoman nation could be possible if only the young people were raised with the liberal ideas of the 18th century European Enlightenment, some parts of which he translated into Turkish. Liberal concepts including freedom, individualism, the ideal man, the natural rights of men, freedom of religion, progress and economic development constituted the repertoire of Münif Pasha’s writings. The fact that he never mentioned collective concepts such as the Ottoman territory as homeland, the historical significance of the Ottoman state, the difference of the Ottomans from the Europeans, the East-West difference or the centrality of Islam in the Ottoman state enables us to place him in contrast to the Islamist-Ottomanist Young Ottomans. The pasha, a practitioner rather than a theorist, was coming from the Westernist line of Mustafa Reşit Pasha’s liberal Tanzimat ideas, while the Young Ottomans were representing the younger generation who were not only opposed to the sultan but to the senior bureaucrats as well.

Münif Pasha’s reputation as a pedagogist and an educational reformist is more significant than his official bureaucratic career. He worked on the educational question of the Ottoman state from the inside out. He not only did bureaucratic work but also worked as a pedagogical journalist and philosopher. Mecmua-i Fünun, the first modern scientific periodical in Turkish, was one of his greatest achievements. The periodical, which was published by the Cemiyyet-i Ilmiyye-yi Osmaniyye (Ottoman Scientific Association), helped promote young students’ awareness of the modern sciences. Münif Pasha wrote about nearly every scientific field including geography, history, law, sociology, philosophy, political economy and pedagogy. Besides his work in scientific circles, the pasha also addressed the masses directly through his columns in daily newspapers. He also hosted many scholars from all around the world, including from Japan and Morocco, who addressed intellectuals as well as ordinary citizens at the kiosk of Münif Pasha in the Cağaloğlu quarter of Istanbul.

On the other hand, the full picture of the intellectual scene of the Tanzimat included others, too. Particularly, there were the older bureaucrat intellectuals with higher ranks than the Young Ottomans. These senior bureaucrats were not revolutionaries, nor did they run out of the country to find the liberty to publish their ideas on Ottoman politics. In fact, they were Ottoman politics. Other than the grand viziers and ministers, such as Mustafa Reşit Pasha, Ali Pasha and Fuat Pasha, perhaps Ahmet Cevdet Pasha, the official historian of the Abdülmecid era and the author of the famous “Mecelle” or the civil code of the Ottoman Empire, was the best example of these conservative but reformist bureaucrats. Reformism was indeed the job he was assigned to.

Münif Pasha was one of the early examples of a complete Westernist Turkish intellectual, who thought that the Turkish state and society should adopt Western European civilization without any hesitations or omissions. Unlike the Young Ottomans, who sought an independent path to Ottoman revival by adopting some features from Europe but not without customizing them, Münif Pasha was very liberal in neglecting the political realities of the 19th century, such as the violent capitalism and imperialism of the Western European forces.

Like all of his peers, Münif Pasha worked at every stage of the Ottoman state. As a well-educated, intellectual young man, he was a good candidate to be patronized. As the Ottoman bureaucratic system relied on patronage, civil servants needed to find a supporting patron, a senior bureaucrat or royal family member, to rise through the bureaucratic ranks. Kemal Pasha, then- Ottoman ambassador in Berlin, supported Münif and had him receive higher education there from German institutions. Münif also read the works of the Enlightenment intellectuals, which convinced him to adopt their understanding of the Ottoman system.

There were other official reformists as well. Münif Pasha, for example, was the man behind the pedagogical reforms of the Tanzimat era. He was appointed as the minister of education three times. He was a significant columnist at the first private Turkish daily newspaper, Ceride-i Havadis. Moreover, he was the archetype of the instructor-columnists, who were a type of Turkish author that gave basic knowledge to the reader in order to enhance the intellectual level of the general public. Finally, Münif Pasha was among the liberal intellectuals such as Süleyman Pasha, Ahmet Vefik Pasha and Ethem Pertev Pasha who supported the idea that the Ottomans should adopt all Western European institutions in order to develop.

Münif Pasha served as a civil servant and bureaucrat until the end of the 19th century, working half a century for the revival of the Ottoman state. Although he worked in various departments including diplomacy, he owed his reputation to the work he did at the ministry of education. He had political ideas, too, and authored some literary works besides his journalism, but today he is best appreciated as an educational bureaucrat and a pedagogist.
