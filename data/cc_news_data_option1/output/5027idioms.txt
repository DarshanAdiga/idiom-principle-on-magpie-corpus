The US coronavirus vaccine task force hopes to get 100 million Americans access to vaccines within 100 days of an FDA green light.

Ludovic Orban, Romania's center-right prime minister, resigned Monday after the populist opposition Social Democrats (PSD) party won around 30% of votes with roughly 95% of ballots counted.
 "I'm not clinging to any post," Orban said, albeit adding that he did intend to participate in upcoming negotiations on a potential coalition government.
 Orban's centrist National Liberal Party (PNL)  came in second, with 24.2%-24.7% of votes for the two houses. The centrist alliance USR-Plus, a likely coalition partner for the Liberals, won 15.4% of votes.
 Orban said earlier Monday that coalition talks with the PSD were out of the question. However, he did not provide a clear explanation for how his party plans to form a new governing majority.
 "Talks to form a majority ... won't be long ... this country needs a government as soon as possible," Orban told supporters, adding that his party had four potential coalition partners to form a majority.

Yet since losing Virgil van Dijk in the derby, Liverpool have conceded just four goals in six league games. Add in the Champions League and it’s six clean sheets in 11. They’ve only actually lost one league game this season, albeit a spectacular one. More than that, the last two home games, against Leicester and then Wolves, have followed a   very encouraging pattern for the champions. Both fixtures were, on the face of it, testing games against sides adept on the counter. If there were weaknesses in a back four stripped of three regulars, the sense was that these were opponents equipped to take advantage. But between them they managed just seven shots on target and lost by a combined score of 7-0. Both were entirely emphatic.

We have a positive of our final part, but now we need to make a negative. We'll take a steel cylinder called a flask and slip it onto the sprue base.

Signaling a willingness to reconsider the reliability of ballistics evidence in light of national scientific reports questioning it, the state Supreme Court on Friday reversed the murder conviction of Donald Raynor, a South Windsor High School graduate and reputed one-time leader of the violent Money Green Bedroc gang in Hartford.

 A new trial would be Raynor’s third. His first trial, in 2014, ended in a mistrial when the Hartford Superior Court jury was unable to reach a unanimous verdict. A different jury in the same court convicted him at his second trial in 2015. He has been behind bars since his June 2013 arrest.

Associate professor in the Department of Fisheries and Wildlife and Extension Wildlife Specialist Dana Sanchez said, “No matter who you are or how you identify, as one of my mentors described it, ‘it’s just a really tough slog.’”
 Those who go through the tenure-track process are constantly learning new concepts, training, prepping and teaching courses, conducting and seeking funding for research, all while preparing for their midterm and final tenure reviews.
 “It’s a compressed amount of time of very hard work, a lot of deep learning,” Sanchez said.
 Though the tenure-track process is difficult for everyone, there are additional pressures and challenges that may arise based on how people identify.
 Sanchez pointed to caregiving and parenting as a couple of the main reasons that lead to less women becoming tenured.
 “Generally, in American society, there’s still a great difference in who does the caregiving,” Sanchez said.
 This statement is reflected in the statistics. According to a report by the American Association of Retired Persons, women represented 61% of caregivers in May 2020.
 A report from YaleGlobal in 2018 showed that in every region studied, including the U.S., women spent more than twice as much time as men on housework and family care.
 Because these responsibilities tend to fall on females more often, women are faced with less time to focus on their tenure goals and more emotional labor, which can increase their stress levels and leave them more exhausted than those who are not expected to provide care or parent others.
 COVID-19, according to Sanchez, has exacerbated the difficulty between balancing parenting and work.
 “Parents are being expected to homeschool and/or help supervise school-guided curricula for their children of potentially multiple different ages and stages of their educations, while they’re lecturing, attending required meetings, writing their articles, writing their grants,” Sanchezsaid.
 Other identities contribute to varying levels of difficulty on the tenure- track ladder.
 “The complexities of intersecting identities can make that tenure climb that much more challenging,” Sanchez explained. “It’s not at all unusual— in fact it’s quite common— for people from underrepresented races, ethnicities, cultures, orientations, LGBTQ+ status, communities, even differences in abilities, that are visible or not visible. Across any of those complex and intersecting identities, if there are very few in the community, they tend to get targeted to represent huge slews of people.”
 Often, these people are asked to mentor and advocate for the larger group that their identity may represent, which occupies time and takes an emotional and mental toll.
 “It is just a difficult process, and anything that exerts pressure, the pressure will always fall more heavily on those who have multiple responsibilities in addition to their work,” Sanchez said.
 Tiffany Garcia, a professor in the Department of Fisheries and Wildlife, agreed that though the tenure-track process is difficult for everyone, different identities can affect a person’s experience.
 “Tenure is incredibly challenging,” she said. “It’s a tough time in an academic’s career, and that’s across pretty much everybody that’s ever done this. It’s a lot of intrinsic and extrinsic pressures. It’s do or die, make or break. If you don’t get tenure, you’re out.”

"I was actually talking to my girlfriend the other day. She asked me that same question (about nerves)," Ballock said. "Obviously you want to perform and you want to play well and you want to do everything you can to win. At the end of day we are just playing basketball.
 "If you approach it like that, do what you are supposed to do, take care of your business, everything else will follow and everything else will play into itself. I haven't been nervous in the past. I don't really see myself being nervous going forward, just come out have fun," he added.
 Ballock, who chose Creighton over KU, Kansas State, Iowa State, Oklahoma and others in recruiting, said the most memorable game he's witnessed in Allen as a fan was the Jayhawks' 109-106 victory over Oklahoma on Jan. 4, 2016.
 "It was triple overtime. Buddy Hield went crazy. I think he had 46, 47 (points)," Ballock said of the OU standout who indeed had 46 that day. Ballock said another overtime game, a 90-84 KU victory over Kentucky on Jan. 30, 2016 was a close second favorite game he viewed from behind KU's bench.
 Ballock confessed Monday he almost chose KU as his college choice.
 "It's kind of hard not to. Obviously you've been in Allen Fieldhouse. It's an unbelievable atmosphere, and the way they do things is … I'm not saying it's the right or wrong way, but they win," Ballock said.
 "When you have a program that wins games like that at the level at which they win, then it's appealing to a recruit especially when you are 15 and 16 years old. Just seeing that so close to home it was just an opportunity for me to play at the next level and play in front of that atmosphere and those fans.
 "At the end of the day, I don't think it fit me as a person overall," Ballock added of KU. "I thought Creighton … the opportunities it posed for me right away and the opportunities it posed for me down (the line) in my future, I thought it was a better situation for me. I think it's going to be more beneficial for me playing out."
 He added: "I've been here for three years. This is my fourth year. I've had an unbelievable experience here at Creighton so I have no regrets. Kansas has done an unbelievable job the past four years so I don't think they miss me that much. It's been fun being at Creighton."
 Creighton coach Greg McDermott said it's been a pleasure to coach Ballock.
 "He is one of the few people I've coached through the course of my career he could have zero points or 28 points and you could not tell by his body language how his personal game is going," McDermott said. "He is about winning. He is about impacting winning.
 "We've blessed to have him here," he added of Ballock, who has a personal best mark of 11 threes made in a game (versus DePaul his sophomore season).
 Also, his 93 makes from beyond the arc in 214 attempts ranked him fifth nationally in three-point percentage (43.5) for players with over 200 attempts a year ago. "He's done a lot for this program in the three-plus years he's been here. I'm hopeful we can have some semblance of a normal season for him to end on," McDermott said.
 The unusual season, one played during a pandemic, continues Tuesday when just the 2,500 fans will be allowed admittance into the fieldhouse instead of the usual 16,300.
 That makes it even more impressive he landed 10 tickets. He had an allotment of four as a participant, a teammate gave him four and Ballock's mom located two more in Eudora.
 "This is going to be the first game where I actually have a majority of my family," Ballock explained. "My brother down in Florida, my sister in Brazil (will attend). I'm going to have 10 total people from my family just with niece and nephews, sister in laws, brother in laws type thing -- 10 total and hopefully some other faces I can pick out in the crowd. It will be fun to see some familiar faces and hopefully see some people I don't expect to see."
