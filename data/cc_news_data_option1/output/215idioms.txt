The one weakness on the 49ers defense of late has been cornerback Ahkello Witherspoon, who has been picked on repeatedly as teams avoid Richard Sherman. Witherspoon has allowed all five TD passes given up by San Francisco the past three games and was benched for Emmanuel Moseley in the first quarter last week after getting beaten for a 41-yard TD by Stefon Diggs. Shanahan hasn’t said what his plan is for this week, but it seems likely Moseley will get the nod after faring well in nine games as a starter earlier this season when Witherspoon was hurt.

South Africas top bowler Kagiso Rabada has been ruled out of the last test of the four-match series against England after being given another demerit point for a robust wicket celebration on the first day of the third test at St Georges Park on Thursday. Rabada was also fined 15 of his match fee after being found guilty of a level one breach of the International Cricket Council code of conduct, the ICC said on Friday.He has now accumulated four demerit points in a 24-month period, meaning he is suspended for South Africas next test, at the Wanderers in Johannesburg from Jan. 24-28. Rabada celebrated bowling out England captain Joe Root on Thursday by running down the pitch, going down on his haunches, clenching his fists and roaring into the ground, under the nose of Root himself.The ICC said he was guilty of using language, actions or gestures which disparage or which could provoke an aggressive reaction from a batter upon his or her dismissal during an international match. Rabada, who is fourth in the ICCs rankings of test bowlers, admitted the offence and accepted the sanction proposed by match referee Andy Pycroft on Thursday.Just under two years ago, Rabada was suspended for two tests against Australia after being found guilty of inappropriate and deliberate physical contact with a player after a shoulder charge on Australia captain Steve Smith in the second test. Rabada was fined 50 of his match fee and handed three demerit points which took him to a total of eight points within a 24-month period, automatically leading to the suspension.But this was overturned on appeal as South Africa successfully argued his brush with Smith was not deliberate. The incident, and a similarly aggressive send off of David Warner in the same game, remained on his record however, and one point for each offence is part of the four demerits collected for the latest suspension.Cricket South Africa have not yet indicated whether they will appeal this time. Seven wickets for Rabada helped South Africa beat England by 107 runs in the first test in Pretoria last month.He took five in the second test defeat in Cape Town and two on Thursday on the first day of the third test.

Ukrainian Prime Minister Oleksiy Honcharuk submitted his resignation on Friday after an audio recording suggested he had criticised the president, but then appeared to suggest that he might stay in his job. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy would consider the resignation letter later on Friday, the presidents office said.Speculation over Honcharuks position has grown this week after a recording of a man discussing Zelenskiys purported lack of knowledge of economics was circulated on messaging channels, apparently at a meeting of the prime minister, finance minister and the National Bank of Ukraine NBU in December. Zelenskiy is a former comic actor who had no political experience when he swept to power in an election last year on the back of public anger over high-level corruption.Honcharuk said on Friday the recording had been doctored and was made up of different fragments of what had been said at government meetings. Its contents artificially create the impression that my team and I do not respect the president, who is our political leader, Honcharuk said on social media. He did not say whether it was his voice heard in the recording.Central bank officials and the finance minister have declined to comment on the recording. Contacted by Reuters shortly after his announcement and asked whether he indeed intended to step down, Honcharuk said Do not jump to conclusions.Under Ukraines previous president, Honcharuks predecessor as prime minister, Volodymyr Groysman, also made threats to resign but ultimately stayed the course until last Julys parliamentary election which Zelenskiys party won. Honcharuk, appointed by lawmakers last August, declined to say whether he was using his resignation letter as a way of testing the presidents confidence in him.It doesnt show the prime ministers desire to resign, but rather its a way for him to fight to stay in his position, Volodymyr Fesenko, a Kiev-based political analyst. MODEL OF OPENNESS AND DECENCYHoncharuk announced his resignation in a message on Facebook where he also praised Zelenskiy as a model of openness and decency. However, in order to remove any doubts about our respect and trust in the President, I wrote a letter of resignation and handed it to the President with the right to submit it to Parliament, he said.Honcharuk appeared in parliament later on Friday and reaffirmed his respect for the president, adding that Ukraine must remain united in the face of what he called information attacks and manipulations. He was given a standing ovation by a number of lawmakers, though some shouted shame on you.Since taking office, Honcharuk has set out an ambitious reform agenda and secured provisional agreement from the IMF for a three-year loan program seen as key to maintaining investor confidence and economic stability. Ukraines dollar bonds softened slightly after the news but later recovered.Seems likely Zelenskiy will reject it, said Tim Ash of BlueBay Asset Management about the letter of resignation. Question is if Zelenskiy accepts it, would any credible reformer opt to sit in Honcharuks place when the said govt session with the NBU was leaked, and Honcharuk was only being honest, he wrote on Twitter.Honcharuks government managed to secure a 5.5 billion IMF loan program in December but this is still subject to Ukraines performance on reforms and tackling vested interests. The resignation offer will not affect them, Honcharuk said in his comments to Reuters on Friday, replying to a question about his governments reforms and the IMF program.

_I'm a 26-year-old bisexual woman with a history of self-harm. It hasn't been much of an issue for the last few years, but my sex life has improved a lot in that time. I realized that I am quite submissive and masochistic, and I have found a wonderful Dominant partner who I've gotten to explore that kink with in a positive and healthy way. Last night, I watched the movie_ Secretary _, and Maggie Gyllenhaal's character is someone who self-harms but stops when she begins a Dom/sub relationship with her boss. Obviously this film is flawed and not exactly a great guideline for healthy BDSM relationships. (The power dynamic! The lack of consent! That weird come scene!) However, I did find myself relating to her character and am now questioning my motives for pursuing this kind of sexual relationship. I worry that I may be unintentionally using the pain that I lovingly experience from my partner as a replacement for the pain I used to experience from my bad habits. Or am I using BDSM as a form of harm reduction? Is it rational to even compare these two things?_

Ride-hailing refers to booking rides and paying for its service via a smartphone app with a transportation network company such as Lyft or Uber. Ride-hailing includes an array of companies and services, comprising traditional taxis as well as car services. The all-embracing concept of ride- hailing is that a customer rents a car or hires a driver to take them accurately where they want to go. It is somewhat like waving to a taxi from the street, virtually hailing a car and driver from an app, or calling up a car service through phone.

“I would like to thank Bill for his dedication and efforts during his time at Wake Forest,” Currie said in a statement.
 Oakes was asked about the impact Isner made on the tournament in the early stages, and he couldn’t help but remember how he landed Isner for the initial tournament.
 “I had gone to Memphis to recruit players and I talked to his coach about our new tournament and he said, ‘No, John won’t be playing,’” Oakes said. “But I continued to do some background and talked to John a little bit and three weeks later in Miami, John says to me ‘I’m coming.’ That was kind of a breakthrough we needed early in our tournament so that worked out great, especially when John won our first two tournaments.”
 Oakes said that the tournament is in great shape and has sponsorships through 2025.
 “I wish them nothing but the best going forward,” Oakes said. “The footprint is there and the city and the community have embraced the tournament in a big way.”
 This year’s tournament will be Aug. 22-29 and will have a purse of nearly $750,000. Once again it will be the final tournament in the nine-tournament series leading to the U.S. Open. The tournament will now have time to hire a replacement for Oakes to be ready for the tournament in August.
 Oakes said he and his wife, Shea, and their two teenage daughters will continue to live in Winston-Salem for the time being. Before coming to Winston-Salem Oakes spent 15 years working with ProServ, a sports marketing agency where he was the general manager of the Atlanta office and he was also the tournament director for the ATP tournament in Atlanta.
 “We can’t say enough about the community of Winston-Salem and how much we have loved living here and raising our two daughters,” Oakes said.

The Winston-Salem Open, which is an ATP Tour 250 tournament, has been played a week before the U.S. Open since 2011 and it was always tricky getting the top players to come to the tournament. That didn’t stop Oakes from trying to land the best fields possible.
 He helped land Greensboro’s John Isner, an obvious top draw, to four of the nine tournaments played. Isner, who has been ranked in the top 10 in his career, won the first two tournaments in 2011 and ’12 that helped put the tournament on the map.
 Oakes was responsible for all aspects of the Winston-Salem Open, which has been played in August at the Wake Forest Tennis Complex adjacent to BB&T Field.
 In 2016 it was named the tournament of the year by the ATP.
 “I think I’m most proud of what we built from scratch when I first got here to Winston-Salem and it was basically a parking lot,” Oakes said by telephone. “We had something like 200 days to get it ready for play, but there were some other memories that come to mind.”
 Oakes also helped bring the Winston-Salem Cycling Classic to its current Gears and Guitars weekend festival format and he helped land the 2018 NCAA tennis championships to Wake Forest.
 While at Wake Forest in his role as an associate athletics director he also helped in the hiring of Bobby Muuss, the men’s soccer coach and Kim Lewellen, the women’s golf coach. Last spring the Deacons lost to Duke in the NCAA women’s golf championship match and this past fall Muuss and the Deacons made it to his second College Cup in his five seasons.
 But his passion and his drive to make the Winston-Salem Open a success was something he worked tirelessly at. He made sure players were comfortable when they arrived for the tournament and made sure he was available to the media at just about any time of the day.

Hastings-Prince Edward District School Board recently announced it had cancelled the Grade 9 math test conducted on behalf of the Education Quality and Accountability Office scheduled for Monday, Jan. 13.   The school board made the decision in response to the provincial government’s ongoing labour dispute with high school teachers represented by the Ontario Secondary School Teachers’ Federation. Following the OSSTF’s announcement that teachers would not be participating in the province-wide testing HPEDSB’s communications manager Kerry Donnell indicated that school boards across the province received word from the Ministry of Education that the administration of the Grade 9 EQAO math test would be a “board-based decision.”   “At HPEDSB, the assessment will not be administered, meaning that students will not be required to complete it at this time,” said Donnell.   “This is in light of the current labour situation with members of the Ontario Secondary School Teachers’ Federation. Under the terms of the job action, OSSTF members may not participate in EQAO preparation or testing.”   Donnell advises any students, parents or guardians with questions about the cancellation of the test to contact their school’s principal.   Although the effectiveness and necessity of EQAO testing has been called into question by teachers and education workers for years, Minister of Education Stephen Lecce defended the tests in a statement issued on Jan. 8, stating “The EQAO Grade 9 math test provides valuable information to students, families, and the province about how students are performing in critical math skills and concepts. It also supports improved teaching and learning. It should not be in jeopardy for our students.”   OSSTF District 29 president Scott Marshall has a different assessment of EQAO testing than Lecce. Pointing out the futility of the EQAO tests, Marshall said “EQAO testing simply tells teachers, parents, and students what we already know. We have been proposing for years better ways to use the millions spent on this political tool.”   Characterizing the teachers refusal to administer the EQAO test, and the union’s legal job action as “unfair” and “undermining student success,” Lecce accused teachers of “jeopardizing the learning experience of Ontario’s future leaders.” If the Ford government was seriously “focused on developing the skills our students need to succeed in the classroom and in the jobs of the future,” as stated by Lecce, Marshall said the province would be willing to address the key issues on the table for teachers – larger class sizes, mandatory e-learning, teaching job losses, and less course options for students.   “They keep wanting to claim that it is the union folks in charge of everything but not when you look at the level of engagement and level of support from our members, but that’s just not true,” explained Marshall.   “There was a vote for our member to support the leadership during the strike votes, and in our area 94 per cent voted in favour. The government narrative is just not truthful and they continue to try and look for traction with it, and that speaks for itself. They are cutting teaching positions and raising class sizes. E-Learning is really concerning too because it really is a step towards privatization. They won’t admit that, but when they run it centrally, and that’s what they are going to do, they are going to farm out learning to some central consortium.”   Last week, Marshall said the OSSTF offered to cancel its planned full withdrawal of services in select boards if the government would agree to returning staffing levels to those in 2018/2019 (adjusted for student enrollment changes), however the government refused.   While high school teachers throughout Ontario continue to fight the Ford government’s cuts and the impact they will have on students and the education system, the province is also declaring that it is looking out for the interests of students. Highlighting how the provincial government refuses to release the findings from a survey of parents it conducted last spring, Marshall said it appears the government’s own priorities take priority over the educational needs of the students.   “They said they did the largest survey ever with parents, yet they have refused to release the results,” said Marshall.   “It has been leaked that the results show that parents do not support an increase in class sizes. So the government isn’t being honest when they say they are ‘setting students up for success’ because they have gone against what the parents have said very clearly to them. I think it is about ideology now, and I don’t think they value public education. I think they are cutting public education because they don’t see the net value to our communities.”   Until progress is made at the bargaining table, Marshall indicated that the OSSTF will continue its withdrawal of certain services and weekly rotating strikes in select school boards throughout the province.
