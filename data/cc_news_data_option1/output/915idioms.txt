The dollar fell further against the euro and yen on Friday as sliding US Treasury yields eliminated more of its interest rate advantage over other currencies.
 Mounting fears over the effects of the coronavirus have driven a drop in expectations for US rates. Markets now bet the Federal Reserve will have to cut rates by 50 basis points for a second time this month.
 The resulting collapse in Treasury yields has ended one of the most popular carry trades globally - borrowing at negative rates in the euro and yen to buy US assets.
 The euro has now reversed all its earlier losses for the year, rising from below $1.08 a few weeks ago to above $1.12.
 ING analysts said they were targeting $1.15 in the coming weeks as aggressive US rate cuts contrasted with the limited room for action at the European Central Bank. Fed fund futures were pricing in about 90 basis points of further easing by the end of the year.
 “For now, expect USD weakness vs G10 FX to continue, and the G10 FX segment outperforming EM FX, with carry trades under pressure,” they said in a research note.
 The euro last stood at $1.1234, after touching $1.1249, its strongest since August.
 The dollar index was down at 96.438, close to its weakest this year.
 Against the yen, the dollar dropped 0.3 per cent to 105.82 yen . The yen is benefiting both from dollar weakness and its reputation as a safe haven.
 The dollar was not weaker across the board. It still holds safe-haven status compared with emerging-market currencies and those exposed to commodities.
 That left it holding gains against the Canadian, Australian and New Zealand dollars, along with currencies across Asia, where the coronavirus economic effect is pronounced.
 Sterling stabilised after Thursday's move higher. It was last up 0.1 per cent at $1.2971.

The Big 12 Tournament will start in less than a week March 11 in Kansas City but there’s still a lot left to play out when it comes to seeding for West Virginia.
 At the top Kansas or Baylor will have the first or second seeds for the event, but the third through seventh lines are still very much up for grabs.
 Why is that significant? Well, the top six teams in the league get a bye and avoid playing four games in four days if they want to try to win the event and the automatic berth to the NCAA Tournament.
 But how about the Mountaineers?
 West Virginia at 8-9 is currently tied with Oklahoma for the sixth slot with one game left this weekend at Baylor. That game is significant for a number of reasons and with a win over the Bears the program could potentially be in a four-way tie for third place at 9-9 as well as several other outcomes.
 The final weekend slate has Texas Tech (9-8) hosting Kansas, Texas (9-8) hosting Oklahoma State and Oklahoma (8-9) going on the road to play TCU (7-10) lending itself to some interesting options depending on how things play out on the final Saturday.
 West Virginia could find itself as high as in third place under a scenario where the Mountaineers are able to beat Baylor, both Texas and Texas Tech lose and then TCU takes care of Oklahoma. That would force a three-way tie-breaker between the Mountaineers, Texas and Texas Tech and the ultimate determination would be going 1-1 against the Bears due to neither beating Kansas. West Virginia would play TCU in the 3/6 match-up under this scenario.
 Fourth place also is still in the cards with a win over Baylor if Texas wins and TCU is able to beat Oklahoma. That is because the Mountaineers would be tied with Texas Tech and would get the edge by going 1-1 against the Bears. Ironically that would force a rematch with the Red Raiders in the 4/5 game.
 A fifth place combination would require West Virginia win over Baylor, a TCU win over Oklahoma and Kansas State beating Iowa State with Texas Tech and Texas both winning Saturday. That would put the Mountaineers against No. 4 Texas.
 If that four-way tie scenario would occur with West Virginia, Oklahoma, Texas and Texas Tech all finishing 9-9, it would put the four teams into a mini- conference where they would be seeded in order of winning percentage against one another. The Mountaineers would be 2-4 putting them in the sixth seed behind Oklahoma (4-2), Texas (3-3) and Texas Tech (3-3). The matchup would be against the Sooners.
 There are multiple other scenarios where West Virginia falls in the sixth seed as well.
 But the final placement and if the program will avoid playing on the first day of the tournament if the Mountaineers can't upend Baylor will depend entirely on what happens with TCU when they host the Sooners.
 The Horned Frogs are sitting at 7-10 in league play with that final game against a Sooners team desperate for a win after an unexpected loss to Texas. If West Virginia can beat Baylor, the Horned Frogs’ result against the Sooners won’t matter when it comes to seeding considering that the Mountaineers would have nine wins which is more than TCU can accumulate but let’s look at things if the opposite occurs.
 All three teams (West Virginia, Oklahoma and TCU) would be sitting at 8-10 overall in league play under that scenario. That would again create a three- team mini-conference with the records of each against one another creating the order from the fifth to the seventh seed. That order would be Oklahoma (3-1), TCU (2-2) and West Virginia (1-3) putting the Mountaineers in line to play on the first day of the tournament.
 That would slot the Mountaineers as the No. 7 overall seed and a rematch with Kansas State on the first night, something that Bob Huggins and his club would like to avoid.
 A lot of options left to play out and all eyes will be on Saturday.

There are currently four Republicans who are in real danger of losing their seats with several others who are not in easy races. Martha McSally of Arizona, Cory Gardner of Colorado, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, and Susan Collins of Maine are all behind the eight ball. Though most analysts are calling their races toss-ups, I would have a much more grim perspective. These seats are likely to be flipped if a concerted effort and a lot of money isn't injected into those races between now and November. Gardner in particular is in trouble as Colorado has gone from purple to very much blue in recent years. Name recognition and incumbency status may not be enough to overcome the state's blue wave that saw Bernie Sanders defeat "moderate" Joe Biden on Tuesday.

 We are only two months into 2020, and the streaming service has already given us that lukewarm sequel to that film about that teen who wrote letters to all the boys she loved before, and which gave the Internet that swoon-worthy pin- up. There is also that new (stellar) season of that show about teens experiencing sexual awakening. And last week, Netflix dropped _I Am Not Okay With This_ , a new show about yet another confused, angsty teen coming to terms with — what else but — a whole lot of curveballs pubescence throws her way.
 This girl, Sydney, hasn’t yet wrapped her head around the recent death of her father; she may be in love with her best (girl) friend, who’s in turn smitten with the annoying school jock; and she is struggling to come to terms with bodily changes… like zits on her thighs.

North America is anticipated to be the largest region for biocides.

The market to target for future growth is undoubtedly the Asia- Pacific region, led by China and closely followed by India. The main reasons for this are – a large amount of investment being made in the water purification industry to cater to the vast population’s demand for clean water, a painting industry that will grow in tandem with urbanisation and construction activities, and an eventual focus on environmentally friendly products. Europe is a largely mature market and is not anticipated to show much growth in the forecast period.

Yehh Jaadu Hai Jinn Ka Written Update for March 5: Aman and Roshni save the day

It's been almost two decades since actor Steve Coogan and director Michael Winterbottom - both Brits - first teamed up to make the eccentric, based-on- fact comedy "24 Party People," in which Coogan starred as music entrepreneur Tony Wilson. Though both men have had stellar careers on their own - a glance at their resumes on IMDB.com is quite impressive - something just clicks when they work together. (Check out "Tristram Shandy" or any of their films in the "Trip" series.)      With "Greed," Winterbottom has written and directed a sharp, smart, and biting satire that takes serious issues, turns them on their heads by infusing a dark comedic element, and provides an opportunity for Coogan to sink his teeth into the role of a despicable individual who it's fun to root against.      He plays Sir Richard McCreadie, a successful, ridiculously wealthy British fashion industry businessman who is facing two major milestones. He's about to turn 60, and he realizes he needs to do something about his well-earned and extremely tarnished public image. How about throwing a big party in his own honor? How about making it a huge party? Let's build a seaside amphitheater in Greece and recreate some gladiator games - a lion in a cage would be a nice touch - and invite everyone he knows that he wants to impress, and pepper the crowd with celebrities, or at least celebrity lookalikes. Well, now, that should celebrate 60 with style and make everyone think that he's a good guy, not a jerk.      The problem is that he is, indeed, a jerk. That's made clear from how he makes demands of and talks down to the men who are constructing his amphitheater. It's shown that he insists on always having his way and is used to ordering people around. A flashback to a courtroom hearing concerning his business practices a few months earlier has him being rude and smarmy to his questioners. Asked about his possibly illegal history of opening businesses that soon go out of business, he dismisses the accusation with "I'm an entrepreneur. I take risks." Flashing back further to his early days in clothing retail, he's seen as a stubborn, hard-driving dealmaker who is full of himself. Going back even further in time, to his school days, it's no surprise to discover that he was a jerk then, too.      Everything is seen through the eyes of this terrible man, as well as through those of two other characters - his unhappy assistant Amanda (Dinita Gohil), who knows all of his nasty tricks, and his easily flustered official biographer Nick (David Mitchell) who, after checking into McCreadie's past and interviewing former employees, is beginning to get a picture of just how awful this guy is.      Yet, jumping all over the place in locations and time, and featuring an oddball cast of characters - his control freak mom (Shirley Henderson) is very protective of him; his ex-wife (Isla Fisher) loves money more than he does - the film is quite funny, often looking at the absurdities surrounding McCreadie. For instance, it brutally and comically bursts the bubble of TV reality shows. One frustrated "contestant" on an episode being filmed near the partially built amphitheater blurts out, "I forgot my line!"      The film moves along at a breezy clip, but slowly, almost imperceptibly, grows darker. Not just concerning problems with the impending party - construction grinds to a halt, guests start sending in regrets - but also in addressing issues of racism, rampant capitalism and resulting wealth inequality. Don't worry, the party does happen, but it morphs into a sort of bad dream, with threats of it turning into a nightmare. And it's still darkly funny! "Greed" gives us another great Coogan performance and another complete original from Winterbottom.      Ed Symkus writes about movies for More Content Now. He can be reached at esymkus@rcn.com.      "Greed"   Written and directed by Michael Winterbottom   With Steve Coogan, Isla Fisher, David Mitchell, Shirley Henderson, Dinita Gohil   Rated R

Twenty-five years ago this month, country music was turned upside down when Canadian singer Shania Twain released her second studio album, "The Woman In Me." It made her one of the most popular stars in the genre and also served as a stepping stone to what would become an impressive international career.      "The Woman In Me" was not a typical album by an up-and-coming artist. Rather, it was a testament of the human spirit. Twain wrote or co-wrote each of the album's 12 tracks with rock producer Robert John "Mutt" Lange. For those who follow music, Lange probably is best-known for his work with Bryan Adams and Def Leppard.      Twain's album went on to produce eight charting singles and sell an impressive 20 million copies.      Twain had a love for rock 'n' roll, while Lange's interest in American country music was growing. The two bonded and Twain's sound began to evolve. Her record company was somewhat caught in the middle, but were pressing her for an album. Despite feeling her new sound was "less country," Polygram/Mercury opted to move forward and let Lange produce the album.      The album's first single, "Whose Bed Have Your Boots Been Under?," fell along the lines of country, while the follow-up single, "Any Man Of Mine," became a massive crossover hit. It quickly topped the Billboard Country Singles chart before crossing over to Top 40.      "Any Man Of Mine" was a major success on both the country and pop radio formats. Twain's star grew by leaps and bounds.      I remember the first time I heard the song and thought, "What?! This is country music?" I liked it.      "The Woman In Me (Needs The Man In You)" followed suit, hitting the country chart. In this case, Twain made her way onto the Adult Contemporary chart, too.      Next, Twain and Lange had recorded two distinct versions of the singles "(If You're Not In It For Love) I'm Outta Here!" and "You Win My Love." Each were recorded differently for country audiences and pop-rock audiences. Can we say brilliant?      Remixed songs were nothing new 25 years ago, but if you were a country performer, it was new territory. Twain was about to become globally known.      ″(If You're Not In It For Love) I'm Outta Here!" and "You Win My Love" both hit No. 1 on the country chart, but "I'm Outta Here!" lived up to its title. The song became a global smash.      "No One Needs To Know" and "Home Ain't Where His Heart Is (Anymore)" continued her hit streak.      By that point, the world knew Twain. Listeners also were learning a little more about the woman behind the music. Her life was not glamorous before. In fact, it was quite sad. She lost both her parents in a tragic accident and was left to care for her siblings. She put off her dreams of being a singer to do so.      The last single to come from "The Woman In Me" was "God Bless The Child," an a cappella prayer she said to herself after her parents passed away. The heartfelt song was the last track recorded for the album and perhaps the most personal.      "The Woman In Me" was named ACM and Billboard's Country Album Of The Year. It also earned Twain her first Grammy for Best Country Album. And it was the pre- cursor to Twain's massive album, "Come On Over," which made her a superstar.      David T.

 Adapted apparently quite loosely from Atkins’ “Robert B. Parker’s Wonderland,” “Spenser Confidential” has ended up with a genially amusing script expertly tailored to its actors by Sean O’Keefe and the canny veteran Brian Helgeland.
 And, as smartly cast by the veteran Sheila Jaffe, “Spenser Confidential” gets spot on performances from a variety of actors, from household names including Alan Arkin to other less celebrated but undeniably talented folks.
 “Spenser Confidential” begins in full action mode, with the title character going to the house of his superior, Boston Police Capt. John Boylan (Michael Gaston) and whaling the tar out of him as partner Driscoll (Bokeem Woodbine) tries to restrain him.
 We won’t learn Spenser’s reasons for the outburst until later, but what happens immediately is that he’s sentenced to five years in a correctional facility.
 The film picks Spenser up on his last day inside (the word “PRISON” is helpfully flashed on screen in giant letters) as a group of sullen inmates attempt to ambush him before he can get out. Good luck with that.
 Spenser has big plans to leave Boston and restart his life as a driver of semi trucks in Arizona (Colleen Camp makes an all-too-brief appearance as his instructor) but fate, as they say, intervenes.
 Our hero is picked up outside prison by his old mentor and boxing/MMA coach, Henry Simoli, played in his most irascible mode by the irresistible Arkin.

Oil slid 1 per cent on Friday as worries about global oil demand and economic growth slowdown caused by the coronavirus outbreak were heightened by concern over non-OPEC crude producers not yet having agreed to cut output further to support prices.
 Brent crude fell 49 cents, or 0.98 per cent, to $49.50 per barrel by 0735 GMT, while US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) was down 46 cents, or 1 per cent, at $45.44 per barrel.
 The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) on Thursday pushed for crude output by OPEC and associated producers - a group known as OPEC+ - to be cut by an extra 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd) in total until the end of 2020. The call came ahead of an OPEC+ meeting scheduled for Friday in Vienna.
 Non-OPEC states were expected to contribute 500,000 bpd to the overall extra cut, OPEC ministers said. But Russia and Kazakhstan, both members of OPEC+, said they had not yet agreed to the deeper cut, raising the risk of a collapse in cooperation that has propped up crude prices since 2016.
 Some analysts expected Moscow to ultimately endorse the agreement.
 “If it says no, the entire union could collapse and with it any new bilateral trade and investment deals in the pipeline as well as the strategic influence Moscow has secured by participating in the production agreement,” RBC Capital Markets said in a research note.
 “There will be a flurry of high-level calls between Moscow, Riyadh and Abu Dhabi to get the deal done.”
 Concerns about the macroeconomic environment are overwhelming the positive impact of the proposed big output cuts, said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets.
 Even with the deep cut, Goldman Sachs said the OPEC+ deal will not be able to prevent a global oil market surplus in the second quarter, or sequentially lower prices in the coming weeks. The bank maintained its Brent price forecast at $45 a barrel in April.
 “Ultimately a rebound in demand, not supply cuts, will be the necessary catalyst for a sustainable rebound in prices,” the bank said.
 Meanwhile ANZ said global oil consumption could fall by 1.6 million bpd in the first half of 2020 and contract by around 300,000 bpd for the full year.
 “Growth may return in H2 (second half of 2020), but is unlikely to be enough to offset the losses,” the bank said.
 “(I) expect that it is just not OPEC and Russia looking to stabilise prices but also the US producers,” said Jonathan Barratt, chief investment officer at Probis Group.
 “Sub $45 I feel is where things start to hurt for producers.”

Today, the US jobs report for February is due to be reported at 13.30 GMT, and as we get closer to the release time, here are the expectations as forecasted by the economists and researchers of 6 major banks, regarding the upcoming employment data. Most of the economists and researchers are expecting US NFP to post-reading in between 170-200k in February, while the consensus is +175k reading. In addition, theunemployment rate is expected to remain at 3.6% for the month. Nordea "Based on a nine-variable model, non- farm payrolls ought to increase by an average of ~120k/month vs the latest rise of 225k in January. Consensus is looking for a 190k gain, but we would take the under." TDS "Payrolls probably slowed significantly after a mild- weather-assisted surge in January. The weather was milder than usual in February as well, but not to the same degree as in January. Our 170K forecast allows for a 7K boost from temporary hiring for the 2020 census, consistent with weekly data released by the Census Bureau." Westpac "February payrolls are expected to increase by 180k. Although employment growth should slow over 2020, this softening should be gradual. In light of this, the February unemployment rate is expected to edge down to 3.5%. February hourly earnings are expected to increase by 0.2%mth, and remain capped at roughly 3.0%yr." Danske Bank "We get the US jobs report for February today. Judging from the latest ADP and ISM signals, we expect to see a decent report with ongoing healthy job creation." Deutsche Bank "While today's payrolls report would usually be the focal point for markets, for now, the data is very much playing second/third/insert as necessary fiddle to what is going on with the coronavirus given that it's all too backward-looking. So it's likely markets will somewhat look beyond what the data shows however for completeness the consensus for today is 175k following a 225k print last month. This should be enough to keep the unemployment rate at 3.6% while average hourly earnings are expected to rise +0.3% mom with the annual rate at +3.0% YoY. Wells Fargo "Following a better-than-expected gain to start the year, we look for the pace of nonfarm hiring to remain strong in February, with employers adding 200,000 jobs."

“Lavoratori che devono doverosamente essere tutelati, come quelli delle Poste, delle Banche e di tutti coloro che si trovano esposti a rischi sanitari. Ma altrettanto quotidianamente io mi domando come mai fino ad ora nessuno, a mia conoscenza, abbia pensato  a mettere in sicurezza il trasporto pubblico locale, quale pericoloso incubatore di virus e germi di ogni genere, considerata la pressante e continua presenza di viaggiatori, alla scarsa igiene dei mezzi che li trasportano e, soprattutto, a quali e quanti rischi vadano incontro i lavoratori che su quegli stessi mezzi svolgono i loro turni quotidiani. Non mi risulta che i mezzi siano stati sanificati, che i lavoratori siano isolati da cabine o paratie per salvaguardarli dall'eventuale contagio e men che meno che i viaggiatori possano viaggiare alla distanza di sicurezza di un metro l'uno dall'altro, cosa che è materialmente impossibile, perché pura utopia. Da queste ‘mine vaganti a rischio contagio’ per viaggiatori e lavoratori, che scorrazzano da Ventimiglia ad Andora (ponente di Savona), senza dimenticare le vallate e le frazioni servite dal TPL, con quali misure di sicurezza il Comune di Sanremo e la Asl1 Imperiese intendono tutelare la salute di chi viaggia e di chi ci svolge il proprio lavoro? Non dimentichiamo che ogni passeggero ed ogni lavoratore del settore può diventare vettore del virus nella sua famiglia e verso tutti i propri contatti personali e privati. A tutt'oggi nessun provvedimento a tutela del settore più a rischio è pervenuto a mia conoscenza attraverso la stampa, né in altro modo, ragione per la quale ritengo che esista una grossa falla nel sistema di prevenzione e tutela circa il contenimento del contagio. La prego prendere in considerazione quanto sopra perché, attraverso la falla, potrebbero passare molti contagi e penso che Lei, come tutti noi, non vorrebbe certo esserne ritenuto responsabile. L'omissione, a volte, porta a conseguenze più nocive della colpa”.

_Dance With The Devil_ is an absurdly exciting and wickedly nails-hard heavy metal record, full of dazzling musicianship, giant tunes and an overall sense that Swiss quintet Burning Witches are giving the none-more-classic a significant sonic upgrade.
 New vocalist Laura Guldemond asserts herself from the off, imbuing explosive opener _Lucid Nightmare_ with a presence and punch that their previous records occasionally lacked.
 These are easily the best songs the band have written. A glowering undercurrent of classic German thrash drives fiercer moments like _Wings Of Steel_ and _Six Feet Underground_ , while the sheer euphoric wallop of the title track and the Accept-like stately bludgeon of _Necronomicon_ prove that _Burning Witches_ kick large amounts of arse at any tempo.
 Even the obligatory ballad, _Black Magic_ , is an absolute belter, while a suitably thunderous cover of Manowar’s _Battle Hymn_ provides an epic conclusion. Right now, there aren’t many better pure metal bands than Burning Witches.

Currently, 18 of the 35 seats up for grabs in November are safe. It would take something catastrophic for Tom Cotton to lose in Arkansas or Dick Durbin to lose in Illinois. That leaves 17 that have the possibility of being flipped, and most of them are Republicans. The good news is one of those that is almost certain to be flipped is Doug Jones in Alabama. He squeaked by the special election due to reports that his Republican opponent, Judge Roy Moore, dated teen girls when he was in his 30s. He denied the reports, but voters were spooked enough to put a Democrat in the seat vacated by former Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Now Sessions and Tommy Tuberville are vying for the opportunity to take on Jones in the general election. Either one of them should beat Jones by double digits.

But while Rivers has always thrown a lot of 50-50 balls, last season he seemed willing to go 40-60 or 30-70 with the defense having as much as an opportunity as the offense. Still, Rivers' competitive fire could be useful to a team looking for a bridge quarterback. He and the Chargers have already said their goodbyes.

The report describing the incident between a Kingston selectmen and a town employee has been completed. Although social media has been flooded the past few weeks with people stating their version of the incident, including describing the incident as an unprovoked assault and attack, I have remained silent based on the advice of labor counsel. I was not at the restaurant on the night of Jan. 9, 2020. It was not my role to decide who was right or wrong, nor whose "side" to take. My responsibility is to read the facts from an independent investigation and discuss with my fellow Board members what action to take based on the results.
 Since the investigator's report has been made public, I am speaking. The report does not say the incident was unprovoked, nor is the behavior described as an assault or attack. The report states both parties were at fault, the conduct that occurred was not sexual in nature or gender-based and the incident was described as a "heated discussion."
 The purpose of executive session was to decide the contents of the document that would be released to the public and what disciplinary action would be taken, if any. The selectmen received two documents from the independent investigator. We received the Report of Investigation, on Friday, which is privileged and confidential, therefore it was not released. Monday we received the Executive Summary of Investigation. Jessica Kramer recused herself during the deliberation and vote pertaining to the release of the executive summary. The remaining four members reviewed both documents and unanimously voted to include additional content (in its entirety) to the Executive Summary of Investigation from the Report of Investigation. The content included did not violate privilege or confidentiality but provided more transparency on what occurred the evening of Jan. 9, 2020. The Board did not make edits, as alleged by Jessica Kramer. Jessica Kramer rejoined the Board to discuss what disciplinary action would be taken, if any. Whether or not we took any disciplinary action will not be disclosed and remains confidential, as it is a personnel matter.
 Josh Warren, as the chairman of the Selectmen, is one member of the Board and does not have the authority to put a town employee on paid administrative leave without a vote of the Board. As a result of this complaint, we were required to notify the town employee at least 48 hours before a discussion could occur at a meeting. The earliest all five board members could meet was Thursday, Jan. 16. For anyone to pretend they know what the conversations had been between Josh and labor council, prior to that meeting, is blatantly wrong and unfounded. On Jan. 16, 2020, Jessica Kramer read her account of a conversation she had with Josh. Unless the phone call was recorded, or being transcribed word for word, these are representations of Jessica. As the independent investigator's report has shown all of us, both parties interpretation of an incident may differ.
 The town deserves leadership that is brave enough to do the right thing even when it is the hard thing, and I did. It would have been easy to support Jessica Kramer and her version of the incident on Jan. 9 and move on. It was hard doing the right thing and waiting for the independent investigation to be completed. Why has it been hard? Just recently, I was accused of going behind the "backs" of my Board because I was at Town Hall on a Friday (after hours) with members of the Police Department. I was authorized by the full Board of Selectmen to negotiate both Police and Fire contracts. That day, I was in negotiations with the Police Department. It has been hard because of the unfounded allegations of corruption, lies, fake news, misinformation, character assassination, stalking, a documented attack on my home, selectmen being followed home after meetings and a town where some took sides before having the facts. As a selectmen for seven years, it is my duty to remain unbiased and to follow protocol and regulations, which is exactly what I did.
 During the same span of time, a recall was initiated. Again, it would have been easy to take a time out and say, I support Jessica Kramer and her version of the incident on Jan. 9 and move on. The right thing to do was to allow the investigation to be completed, meet as a Board and determine the next course of action. Again, I did that.
 It would have been easy to put politics before principles, but I did not. In fact, at the Sept. 13 selectmen's meeting Josh and I voted to provide Jessica Kramer and any participants protection against any liability claims with our positive vote to support the Offal Pits cleanup. Even with a positive vote, members of the audience were yelling at Josh and me to resign, over four months before the Jan. 9 incident occurred. Now, four months later, the yells for us to resign have turned into a recall. Kingston has always been known for its divisive politics, and this is no different. Some people don't want to accept votes at Town Meeting that have encouraged development projects in town or the votes taken at town elections. In spite of that, I will continue to work on what you have told me is important to you, generating revenue to lessen the tax burden, and working with the Affordable Housing Trust on avenues to provide alternative housing options for our residents, and many other initiatives. That is my duty, and I will continue to represent this town that has elected me to do so.
 Elaine Fiore, Kingston selectmen

HOUSTON (AP) — Kawhi Leonard scored 25 points and the Los Angeles Clippers rolled over the Houston Rockets 120-105 on Thursday night for their sixth straight victory. The Rockets were done in by their shooting woes in a game that was billed as a matchup of two of the top teams in the Western Conference, but was a rout almost from the start. Houston had a chance to take the season series and secure the tiebreaker over the Clippers, but the loss left the teams tied 2-2. Houston made just 7 of 42 3-pointers to drop its second straight game in embarrassing fashion after losing to the lowly New York Knicks on Monday night. Russell Westbrook led the Rockets with 29 points and 15 rebounds. James Harden was 4 of 17, missed all eight 3-pointers he attempted and had 16 points.NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Filip Forsberg and Matt Duchene each scored power-play goals and the Nashville Predators shut out the Dallas Stars 2-0 to snap a three-game skid. Forsberg snapped a 16-game skid with his first goal since Jan. 30, while Duchene scored his first since Feb. 15 to move the Predators back to the Western Conference's second wild-card spot at least for a bit. Juuse Saros made 32 saves for his third shutout this season. The Predators opened with a moment of silence before the national anthem for the 24 victims of tornadoes that swept through Tennessee early Tuesday morning. The Stars have lost four straight.STORRS, Conn. (AP) — Christian Vital scored 26 points in his final home game and UConn beat No. 21 Houston 77-71. Freshman James Bouknight added 17 points and Isaiah Whaley had 13 for the Huskies, who won their fourth straight game, but just their second this season over a ranked opponent. Quentin Grimes scored 24 points and Caleb Mills added 20 for Houston, which fell into a tie for second place in the American Athletic Conference. The Cougars led by seven at the half, but UConn used a 15-2 second-half run to take control.AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — The Texas Longhorns have gone from unwatchable to unbeatable. A five-game win streak with a lineup decimated by injuries has raised Texas from near the bottom of the Big 12 into a possible NCAA Tournament team. And they are slowly turning the conversation about the future for coach Shaka Smart. The winning streak is a making a strong argument to let him stick around despite the program's struggles over the previous three years. Texas hosts Oklahoma State on Saturday.WACO, Texas (AP) — The No. 2 Baylor women have won all of their Big 12 home games for the third season in a row. Te'a Cooper scored 20 points, fourth-year senior Lauren Cox had 17 and the Lady Bears beat Texas 69-53. Cox and NaLyssa Smith both had double-doubles as Baylor improved to 28-1 overall. The Lady Bears have won a record 58 Big 12 regular-season games in a row, and 56 games in a row overall at home. The last time Baylor lost a Big 12 regular season game, or at home, was three years ago against the Longhorns.FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) — The Houston Astros heard some boos and a few cheating chants when they went on the road to play the Boston Red Sox in a spring training game at Fort Myers, Florida. But all in all, the crowd wasn't too harsh Thursday. Not compared with what the Astros have drawn elsewhere so far in the wake of their sign-stealing scandal. No stars played for Houston against the Red Sox. But Boston fans might've been more reserved because they know Major League Baseball is still investigating allegations that the Red Sox also ran an illegal sign-stealing scam.WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — George Springer's goal for the 2020 season is to be more consistent, just like teammate Michael Brantley. Brantley is a four-time All-Star who has finished among the top 10 in batting average four times in 10 full seasons. Springer hit .292 with a .383 on-base percentage and a .974 OPS last year, all career bests. He is trying to shorten his swing, reducing some of the arm and hand movement that can lead to wild misses. Even if Springer doesn't match Brantley's consistency, new Astros manager Dusty Baker doesn't plan on pulling him from the lead-off spot.LORMAN, Miss. (AP) — Maurice Howard scored 22 points and made all 11 of his free throw attempts and Alcorn State upset Prairie View A&M 80-71. Troymain Crosby scored 19 points with nine rebounds for the Braves (14-14, 10-7), who entered the game fifth in Southwestern Athletic Conference standings and led wire-to-wire. Deshaw Andrews and Corey Tillery had 10 apiece. Devonte Patterson scored 33 points with 10 rebounds for the top-ranked Panthers (18-12, 14-3), who are already assured at least a share of the conference title. Darius Williams added 16 points.

So, what can you do as a student in Lexington? If you haven’t already wondered about where your coffee beans come from, start to wonder. Certifications are a great way to start thinking about what you want to support or not support when you purchase coffee.
 The Fair Trade Certification aims to empower and directly compensate farmers, targeting the economic and social issues associated with certain products including coffee. The Rainforest Alliance Certification requires that farmers adhere to the criteria of the Rainforest Alliance Sustainable Agriculture Standard which targets all three pillars of sustainability. If you want to support coffee farmers who acquire these certifications, consider purchasing beans and making your own coffee at home.
 If you want to know even more about the nuance involved in production and consumption of coffee from every perspective, consider taking Dr. Michael Goodin and Dr. David Gonthier’s GEN 300 Special Topics Coffee Course. This duo piloted the course in Fall of 2019, and they absolutely put their heart and soul into it. They were kind enough to allow me to sit in on a few classes, which ranged from professional-level coffee tastings, to local and international speakers, to the chemistry of coffee.
 Disguised as a simple GEN 300, this course tackled coffee from every angle you can think of – from climate change to global dynamics, they proved that you can connect coffee to any and all topics.

On Tuesday night, Ollie Tyndall sat alone in the Kinston High School men's basketball coaches office, knees pulled to her chest, her face pressed against them with her eyes filled with tears.
   
 Only 20 minutes earlier, the Kinston Vikings suffered their fourth loss of the season to Farmville Central 68-53 in the fourth round of the NCHSAA state playoffs, ending their chances at a state championship.
   
 Ollie had spent the last two days at practice with her father, head coach Perry Tyndall, intently watching the Vikings prepare. Tyndall said she has learned as the players have learned, including being able to spot offensive fouls in the Lakers vs. Pelicans NBA tilt.
   
 But for the final time, this group of Vikings walked off the floor, many in tears like Ollie.
   
 Before long, players began exiting the locker room, and before leaving, seniors Will London and Chance Minott saw Ollie and walked over to give her a hug. A short while later, her father walked out and gave his daughter a hug and reminded her that everything would be okay.
   
 "My kids are so much a part of what goes on here," Tyndall said. "They look up to all those guys. I think Ollie hurts right now because she sees them hurting. She's been here the last two practices, not on a device or anything. I'm a girl dad, and my daughter is somebody who has watched these guys, loves these guys and her hurt is because they hurt."
   
 It was a disappointing end to a promising season for Kinston, as the Vikings suffered their third straight loss to Farmville Central and finished with a 26-4 overall record and two games shy of the ultimate goal of a state championship.
   
 "Hats off to Farmville. It is definitely not the way you want your season to end. I wanted this for the guys so bad," Tyndall said. "We weathered some early storms and our guys just kept battling, and defensively they were good early."
   
 In his final game as a Viking, Isaac Parson scored a team-high 16 points and dished out seven assists, pushing his team to score in the third and fourth quarters but ultimately came up short. Junior forward Dontrez Styles recorded a double-double with 13 points and 10 rebounds, but was held scoreless in the second and third quarters.
   
 "I think Farmville Central did a good job on (Styles)," Tyndall said. "He found himself in the corner a couple times and they were trapping. Every time he went to put it on the floor he had people right at him. He had a whole lot of attention on him. But he's a grinder, he's tough and I don't worry about him at all."
   
 The normally high-scoring Vikings offense struggled Tuesday night to put the ball in the basket. Kinston missed several baskets near the rim and made just one three-pointer in the contest, a desperation shot near half court from Parson as time expired in the second quarter.
   
 Senior forward Jaquan Mosley picked up his fourth foul in the third quarter and Styles and Minott played with three fouls much of the second half.
   
 Ultimately, the Vikings couldn't slow down Farmville Central point guard Samage Teel, who scored a game-high 25 points and finished a rebound shy of double-double with nine. Junior guard Terquavion Smith added 20 points and four rebounds while senior guard Justin Wright added 11 points.
   
 Both teams opened the game by attacking the rim. Smith gave the Jaguars an early 4-0 lead with a slam dunk, Mosley responded with two dunks, assisted by Parson, to tie the game.
   
 Late in the first quarter, Styles hammered home a dunk to give Kinston a 14-13 lead, which would carry over into the second quarter. Farmville Central outscored Kinston 11-5 in the second quarter, giving up just one field goal, a desperation three by Parson as time expired in the half to cut the lead to 24-19.
   
 After a Jaguar bucket to open the third quarter, Kinston cut the lead to 26-24 thanks to another Mosley dunk followed by a Parson and-one.
   
 That would be as close as the Vikings would come however, as Teel scored nine straight points, including two threes to open the lead to 35-24, forcing Kinston to call timeout with 5:18 left in the third quarter.
   
 "They made some big shots and we got caught up in some bad rotations, and typical Farmville, they are going to capitalize," Tyndall said. "When they separated I thought we got sped up into some quick shots and didn't allow the ball to move the way it was supposed to. One of the keys to the game for us was not feeding their run, and at times we did. We started pressing a little bit."
   
 The Jaguars ended the third quarter with a 50-32 lead thanks to a Wright three off an assist from forward Leontae Moye and a fastbreak layup by Smith.
   
 Parson willed the Vikings back within 12 points in the fourth quarter with several tough layups, but the comeback attempt would fall short.
   
 "He wants to win so bad. What he has brought and how he has grown every year has been tremendous," Tyndall said. "He wants to lead and hates to lose."
   
 While the season fell short of the ultimate goal, Tyndall told his team after the game they etched their names forever in Kinston basketball history.
   
 "Their legacy has been left here," Tyndall said. "They were outright conference champions and conference tournament champions again. Yeah we had bigger goals, but their legacy has been left. When they bring their kids and grandkids to watch games down the line, they will be able to point to something they put in this gym. I'm so proud of them and I wish we could be practicing another day."
   
 For the third straight season, the Kinston Lady Vikings will be headed to the NCHSAA Final Four. The Lady Vikings took down Randleman 46-41 on the road to improve to 27-3 overall and advance to the next round to face Farmville Central, who defeated North Lenoir 68-51 Tuesday night.
   
 The Lady Vikings built a 41-28 lead in the fourth quarter, but had to hold off a furious run from Randleman in the closing minutes to secure the win. Meanwhile, the Lady Hawks trailed 23-4 after the first quarter and could never recover.
   
 The Final Four will take place on March 7, but the location and time has not been determined yet. Last season, Kinston fell to Farmville Central in the Final Four 76-56.

Similarly, the yearly backlash targeting Aurat March participants is to boot telling of the level of sexism ingrained in our culture. Every year the participants of the march receive death threats and rape threats for holding placards that call out men for their sexism and misogyny. To most Pakistani men and women who have internalized misogyny, the mere idea of women coming out on streets to talk about their sexuality is a threat to the moral fabric of society. This could also be the reason why victim blaming is common in the country. Within a month of the Aurat March last year, the mother of a rape victim was shamed for what had happened to her daughter. People claimed that had it not been for her mother to hang out with the rapist, her daughter would not be raped. Such allegations are not novel in Pakistan or any other patriarchal country in the world. However, it is imperative that people unlearn the misogynistic and sexist values they have internalized.

Asian shares and US stock futures tumbled on Friday as disruptions to business from the coronavirus worsened, stoking fears of a prolonged global economic slowdown.
 MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 2.1 per cent, while Japan's Nikkei stock index sank 2.94 per cent. Australian shares were down 2.44 per cent.
 Europe looked set to follow Asia lower, with Euro Stoxx 50 futures shedding 2.44 per cent, Germany's DAX futures down 2.33 per cent, and FTSE futures off 1.94 per cent.
 US stock futures erased early gains to trade down 1.21 per cent.
 Yields on 10-year US Treasuries fell to a record low and Treasury futures jumped as investors increased bets that the Federal Reserve will follow this week's surprise 50 basis point rate cut with further easing to prevent corporate bond spreads from widening further.
 Rapidly falling yields hammered the dollar, which fell to a six-month low versus the yen and close to a two-year trough against the Swiss franc.
 Oil prices also fell due to worries that non-OPEC oil producers might not agree to output cuts even though global energy demand is weakening.
 The spread of the coronavirus has accelerated so much in Europe, Britain and North America that investors who once played down the virus or thought it would be largely confined to Asia are now re-assessing the risks, which means more volatility in financial markets.
 “Given the pace of US inflation, yields are too low and I certainly don't want to buy Treasuries at this level,” said Ayako Sera, market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank in Tokyo.
 “But the fact that other people are buying shows very strong desire to escape from risk. This is a panic.”
 Shares in China fell 1.22 per cent, while stocks in Hong Kong, another city hard hit by the virus, fell 2.12 per cent.
 ## BUSINESS DISRUPTIONS GROWING
 The S&P 500 tumbled 3.39 per cent on Thursday. The benchmark has skidded more than 10 per cent from its February 19 closing high, and last week saw its biggest weekly percentage decline since October 2008.
 Officials and companies in Britain, France, Italy, and the US are struggling to deal with a steady rise in virus infections that have in some cases triggered corporate defaults, office evacuations, and panic buying of daily necessities.
 The flu-like virus emerged late last year in the central Chinese city of Wuhan and has since spread to more than 80 countries. It has claimed more than 3,000 lives, and though new infections have slowed in China there are concerns other countries are not prepared.
 Travel restrictions and factory closings aimed at curbing the spread of the virus are expected to pressure global growth.
 Many investors were awaiting the release of US non-farm payrolls later on Friday. Recent US economic data has been encouraging, but concerns about the epidemic are likely to overshadow any signs of a strong labour market.
 The Federal Reserve and Bank of Canada both responded to the economic threats by cutting interest rates by 50 basis points this week.
 The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes fell to a record low of 0.8100 per cent on Friday. The two-year yield skidded to 0.4810 per cent, the lowest since April 2015.
 Treasury futures, normally subdued in Asia, rose by 25 ticks.
 Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari said late on Thursday the Fed could cut rates further if needed.
 Money markets are pricing in another 25 basis-point-cut from the current 1 per cent to 1.25 per cent range at the next Fed meeting on March 18-19 and a 50-basis-point cut by April.
 Against the Japanese yen, the dollar fell to a six-month low and was last at 105.84 yen. The greenback also sank to a two-year trough of 0.9438 Swiss franc.
 Sterling traded near a one-week high versus the dollar.
 The euro held steady at $1.1232. Markets in the euro zone are pricing in a 93 per cent chance that the European Central Bank will cut its deposit rate, now minus 0.50 per cent, by 10 basis points next week.
 US crude fell 1.13 per cent to $45.38 a barrel, while Brent fell 1.12 per cent to $49.43, with worries about a decline in global demand due to the virus outbreak and uncertainty about production cuts hurting prices.
