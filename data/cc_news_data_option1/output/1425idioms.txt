 With the resumption of the season not expected for at least another month, given that the players will need at least three weeks for a mini pre-season to get them back up to speed, pitches are expected to be to a similar standard to how they are at the start of a new season.

Its marketplaces were alive with haggling. There was a whiff of danger which I realized I liked. Nowadays Morocco has fast and efficient intercity trains, but in 1995, they were old, slow and charming -- not including the toilets. Stations were filled with a hustle of vendors offering food and mint tea. Between stops, hot air blew through the open windows. Last stop for me was Mount Toubkal, Morocco's highest peak.

 However, Brooks has missed out on any first team action this season due to an ankle injury. Surgery earlier last year ruled him out for a significant period of time and he only began moderate training again just before the suspension of league football.
 Nevertheless, Brooks’ debut season in the English top-flight saw him develop from an exciting talent into a consistent performer during the 2018/19 campaign.
 A number of personal attributes demonstrated during that season made a significant injury this season all the more frustrating. However, he is likely to return fully fit once play resumes and could certainly thrive under Mourinho at Spurs if a deal could be agreed.

A 90th-minute header from Alexis Sanchez secured a stunning comeback from Manchester United as they came from 2-0 down to beat Newcastle United 3-2.
 Pressure on Jose Mourinho had intensified after four games without a win in all competitions, although the club had dismissed reports he would be sacked regardless of Saturday's result.
 It looked as though the manager's days could be numbered when Newcastle raced into a two-goal lead inside 10 minutes, but second-half goals from Juan Mata, Anthony Martial and substitute Sanchez sealed all three points in remarkable fashion.
 Newcastle went in front for the first time in a league game this season only seven minutes in, as Kenedy ran onto Ayoze Perez's throughball, turned away from Ashley Young and curled past David de Gea.
 It was 2-0 just three minutes later, Yoshinori Muto spinning beyond Young and firing home from 12 yards out, prompting Mourinho to bring on Mata for Eric Bailly in a drastic reshuffle of his side.
 Marcus Rashford then headed a golden chance wide as sections of the United fans began to turn their ire towards the club's board, chanting in support of Mourinho and former captain Gary Neville, who criticised the club's hierarchy on Friday.
 It could have been even worse for United before the break, with De Gea clawing away a header from Muto and Young perhaps lucky not to concede a penalty for blocking a free-kick with his arm – although Muto was likewise fortunate for escaping the same offence in his own box.
 Mourinho jogged down the tunnel at half-time to considerable applause from the home fans, who should have been celebrating a goal five minutes after the restart, when Nemanja Matic blazed over the bar with the goal gaping after Martin Dubravka denied Paul Pogba.
 Mata grabbed a lifeline 21 minutes from time with an excellent free-kick from 20 yards out, which seemed to spark some life back into the home side, and Martial made it 2-2 after combining brilliantly with Pogba before firing into the bottom-left corner.
 United's pressure did not relent and Sanchez responded to his own critics with a fine header from Young's deep cross from the right, prompting resounding chants in support of Mourinho from the buoyant home crowd.

Lower Moreland police have identified five suspects allegedly responsible for stealing, or attempting to steal, items out of 14 vehicles over the last three weeks.
   
 The Montgomery County community has seen a big uptick in the thefts since Pennsylvania went into lockdown in response to the fast-spreading coronavirus, police Chief David Scirrotto said.
   
 Last weekend, 12 vehicle thefts or attempts were reported on top of 15 during the previous week, Scirrotto said. He said he is sure the true number is higher.
   
 "We're getting hit significantly on a daily basis," he said. "This is a major rash."
   
 The thieves are not only targeting unlocked vehicles, but locked ones, Scirrotto said. The incidents are happening during daytime and overnight hours.
   
 The situation prompted Scirrotto to create a special response unit dedicated to quality-of-life crimes. The unit conducts surveillance in areas where high numbers of thefts have been reported.
   
 It was during one of those surveillance assignments Sunday when police spotted two men next to a Toyota Camry in the area of Marc and Levy lanes, according to a probable cause affidavit.
   
 Both men took off running when officers approached the car, police said. They identified one of them as Kevin Washington, 19, of Philadelphia.
   
 Washington was later found hiding under trees at the nearby Forest Hills Cemetery off Byberry Road and was taken into custody, police said. The officer recognized Washington as someone he arrested last year for stealing from vehicles and backyard sheds, the affidavit said.
   
 When officers investigated the area where Washington and the other man were first seen, they found signs that nearby cars had been broken into.
   
 Police confirmed nine thefts, or attempted thefts from vehicles parked in driveways and three sheds had been broken into along Bent Road and Pheasant Lane.
   
 Inside the Toyota Camry, police found suspected stolen items including cellphones, electronics, gift cards, jewelry, money and tools. They also learned a third man, who was in the car, had escaped.
   
 Police said they believe the men are suspects in other similar theft from vehicles in Bucks and Montgomery counties, as well as Philadelphia.
   
 Washington, along with Imtiaz Ali, 23, and Nick Filatkin, 20, also from Philadelphia, are facing a dozen felony and 30 misdemeanor charges. Arrest warrants have been filed for Ali and Filatkin, police said.
   
 Washington, who violated his probation, was arraigned and sent to Montgomery County Prison in lieu of $50,000 cash bail.
   
 Those arrests followed the arrests of two men who allegedly are responsible for another rash of daytime car break-ins at parks in three Montgomery County communities, police said.
   
 Keidrick Bosett, 36, no address, and Gary Grier, 34, of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, targeted locked vehicles parked at Mason Mill Park in Upper Moreland and the Camphill and Highland Athletic Complex in Upper Dublin, police said.
   
 Between March 17 and April 1, police allege the men broke into, or attempted to break into five vehicles, according to a probable cause affidavit.
   
 Police allegedly identified the black Ford Edge SUV the men were using based on a witness description and surveillance footage from nearby businesses.
   
 During a search of the car, police found clear and tinted vehicle window glass on Bosket and Grier, and a small tool with a seatbelt cutter and window punch, according to court documents. They also found a Pennsylvania driver's license, bank and credit cars in the name of the victims whose cars were broken into, police said.
   
 Both men were arraigned on more than two dozen misdemeanor charges including possession of marijuana, theft from vehicle, conspiracy and receiving stolen property and released on $10,000 unsecured bail.

Regardless of who the JBPA chief was, though, no one could've imagined dealing with the situation caused by the COVID-19 outbreak, which would eventually force the league to cancel the remainder of its 2019-20 campaign.
 Looking back at when he took the baton from former president Joji Takeuchi last fall, Taguchi was frank when he told the Alvark Tokyo forward/center he could not bear the responsibility being the head of the association.
 “He said, ‘We couldn’t think of anybody else but you,’” Taguchi said, recalling Takeuchi's words in a recent interview with The Japan Times. “‘You’ve been actively involved in our charity events and meetings, it’s got to be you who leads the players.’”
 The JBPA was formed back in 2013, when the men’s top-flight pro basketball scene was split between the National Basketball League and bj-league. Yusuke Okada, who now plays for the Kyoto Hannaryz, was the inaugural president.
 According to Taguchi, the majority of the league's Japanese players are members.
 The JBPA is a general incorporated association and does not operate as a labor union, unlike the similar organizations in the NBA, Major League Baseball and other prominent pro leagues around the world. Its main objective is to promote the game and raise basketball's popularity throughout the nation.
 But as a result of the confusion surrounding the coronavirus situation, the JBPA, perhaps for the first time since its inception, sat down with the league in meetings to discuss what the players would like to do with the season.
 After a couple of weeks of hiatus, the league resumed play on March 14. But two games were called off after a few players and a referee recorded fevers right before tipoff.
 Taguchi said after the Levanga Hokkaido-Kawasaki Brave Thunders game at Todoroki Arena on March 14, one of the contests that was canceled, the JBPA gathered opinions from players about competing under the uncertain circumstances.
 The 30-year-old said there were players who would play if the season went on, but none who were adamant play should continue.
 “There were also somewhat negative voices asking things like, ‘What if there are secondary infections on the team?’ Or, ‘This is a game where you have a lot of physical contact and what if we get infected?’” said Taguchi, who averaged 6.4 points while starting in all 40 games for the Jets, who finished third in the East Division with a 28-12 record, during the shortened season.
 On March 16, one day after that chaotic weekend, JBPA leaders had a discussion with the league to convey concerns players were having.
 Takeuchi and a few other members visited the league office for that meeting, while Taguchi and other association leaders participated via a teleconference system.
 Before the season resumed, the league issued coronavirus measures for clubs to follow, including what players needed to do if they experience symptoms of the virus.
 Taguchi said some players insisted their respective clubs had not fully instructed them about these guidelines.
 Some of the import players expressed their concerns about competing under the circumstance while others said they did not feel they were protected enough by their clubs or the league.
 The JBPA had another meeting with the league on March 25, two days before the circuit announced the season cancellation.
 One thing Taguchi regrets is not having a meeting when the league initially went on hiatus in late February.
 “Yes, we should’ve done it earlier,” the Akita Prefecture native said. “When the league was suspended, we as players probably thought we would be back on the court again, not thinking about it too seriously. I don’t think anybody thought at the point the league would be canceled. But it (cancellation) ended up happening, for the first time (since the league started). So I don’t want something like this to happen again, but in case it does, I, as the president, would like our players association to move faster.”
 Meanwhile, Kawasaki guard Ryusei Shinoyama, who is a vice president of the JBPA, said late last month that it was a positive that the association and league communicated with each other to discuss how the league be run.
 “We feel like the distance between the league and our players association has gotten closer, and we were grateful about that,” Shinoyama said. “It was a positive experience for us because we feel our players association was able to raise our value through this.”
 Taguchi agrees completely. He added that he would like to genuinely make the association serve as a window to represent the players' voices going forward.
 “It’s been like, we hear from players but haven’t really had the occasion (to convey the messages to the league),” said Taguchi, who moved to the Jets from the Akita Northern Happinets in 2018. “But from here on out, we would like to be on the same page as the players association so we can remove anxieties of our players.”

Pakistan was slated to play Bangladesh in a Test match, but it had to be postponed due to COVID-19."If, hopefully in the near future cricket is possible and the health of people is not compromised, I'm sure every cricketer will say we should get cricket back on, even if it is behind closed doors," sport24.co.za quoted Ali as saying."There is no sport on TV right now that people can watch. They will be happy to get sport back on TV. People's health is more important, but if we can get sport going without imperiling that, I'd support it," he added.Ali has also given his suggestion that ICC should look to extend World Test Championship beyond the scheduled end of 2022 to fit in all the matches."I'm sure the ICC will look at this. The Test Championship was a long competition anyway, so I don't think it would be a big deal to extend it if the series cannot be held in time; I'd support extending the Test championship," Ali said.Pakistan also has to face England this year in three Tests and three T20Is.The series will begin from July 30 if the current situation improves.England is currently placed at the fourth spot in the World Test Championship standings with 146 points from nine matches.Pakistan is placed fifth with 140 points from five matches.

Olivia and Raul De Freitas are currently on their honeymoon, at a five-star resort, in the Maldives. The couple arrived just married from South Africa, where they are citizens, on Sunday, March 22, planning to stay for six days. Still, they had some concerns about the trip, considering the mounting travel restrictions imposed in light of the new coronavirus outbreak around the world. But nothing specific that would affect them had been announced, and their travel agent assured them that, whatever policy was forthcoming, all South African citizens would be allowed back home. Go ahead and have a great time, they were told.  By Wednesday, they received notice that their country’s airports would all be closed by midnight Thursday. Flights back to South Africa are five hours to Doha, Qatar, a three-hour layover, and then nine hours to Johannesburg — so even if they scrambled, and even if they could get a flight, the complexities of leaving their remote island ensured they’d never make it home in time. By Sunday March 29, they were the only guests at their resort. On Sunday, April 5, the couple received a WhatsApp from their embassy telling them to be ready in an hour. They were taken by speedboat to another five-star resort, where South Africans in the Maldives, about two dozen in all, are being consolidated.

 Platt had been heavily backed in the transfer market with little to show for it.

 He still wanted the job having played for the club in the mid-80s under Brian Clough.
 "We'd hit an awful lot of debt, but I did want to be manager of Nottingham Forest," he said.
 "Who wouldn't? It's such a great club. I just loved the place.
 "We'd done really well in youth development, but my brief was tough. I had to reduce the wage bill by, I don't know, £4m, bring in some money and try to remain competitive.

I think for me, to let myself really go back there and remember what it felt like and then subsequently what that thought feels like when it appears is just, that’s always been what’s hard for me about it, is that it doesn’t feel scary in the moment, it feels lustful, it feels delicious. And I think that’s what I was really interested in trying to convey, and then also come to terms with, what do you do when this thought feels delicious ... but what if some other part of you knows you do want to keep enduring, how do you navigate that and how do we contend with that thought?

Also, in India, the film won Best Director award at Rajasthan International film Festival.

Karachi, Apr 11 (PTI) Pakistan's centrally-contracted players are mentally prepared for pay cuts if the health crisis created by the coronavirus pandemic persisted for a few months, Test captain Azhar Ali said on Saturday.
 In a video interaction with the media, Azhar said he and his colleagues are aware that the situation is not ideal due to the COVID-19, which has halted sporting activities across the globe.
 "It is not a good situation for any country and we know that if this lockdown situation continued for a few months, the Board might ask us to take pay cuts in the old or new central contacts," Azhar said.
 "If such a situation arises that we are asked to take pay cuts we are mentally prepared for it and we will sit down with the Board and take the best decisions."
 The veteran of 78 tests also said that cricket playing nations and players cannot sit at home for months and no cricket is held.
 "Yes at some stage if this situation persists the option of playing in front of empty stadiums can be discussed but only if proper health and preventive measures are put in place by authorities for all stakeholders," he added.
 "It is unfortunate that fans are not watching any action even on TV and if cricket is played behind closed doors, it will provide fans with an opportunity to (at least) watch some cricket, but the health of the public should not be compromised," he said.
 The PCB has so far said it would ensure payment of the monthly salaries of all centrally-contracted payers and those who have been given domestic cricket contracts at least until end of June.
 But the board has made it clear even it is not sure what scenario would emerge after June.
 The PCB last year after trimming the list of players from 33 to 19 gave central contracts in different categories running from 1st August to 30th June 2020. Babar Azam, Sarfaraz Ahmed, and Yasir Shah are in category A while there are eight cricketers, including Azhar, are in category B.
 The category C also has eight players, including Hasan Ali and Mohammad Amir.
 The centrally contracted players get monthly salaries ranging from 300,000 to 12 lakhs.
 Azhar also backed the suggestion of head coach and chief selector, Misbah-ul- Haq that the ICC should extend the World Test Championship in April whenever cricket resumes so that every team gets a proper chance to gather points and play in the final.
