Hiring is believed to have slowed since the spring, when states reopened and millions of workers at bars, restaurants and stores were rehired. The job gain in August will probably fall short of the 1.8 million added in July, analysts say.

The COVID-19 pandemic is taking a tremendous toll on communities across America, especially households and small businesses with the least resources to weather the storm.2 The COVID-19 crisis is a dramatic reminder of the importance of a resilient and trusted payments infrastructure that is accessible to all Americans. It was notable that after a sharp reduction in spending early in the COVID-19 crisis, many households increased their spending starting on the day they received emergency relief payments under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) and continuing for the following 10 days-especially households with lower incomes, greater income declines, and lower liquid savings.3 The urgency with which the CARES Act emergency payments were spent underscores the importance of immediate and trusted access to funds for the many households and businesses that face cash- flow constraints. That is why the Federal Reserve remains committed to delivering on the FedNowSM Service, which will enable millions of American households and small businesses to get instant access to funds rather than waiting days for checks to clear.4

 Last October, I wrote about having my readers call the fire department to come over and check the smoke detectors in their homes. When they visited our home last fall, they also urged that folks have the dryer vent cleaned out professionally.
 So, my story goes back to three years ago, when we moved into our condo. As we were leaving our house on Stephenson Street, the house up the street was surrounded by firemen trying to subdue a dryer vent fire. The smoke damage that the neighboring house suffered was unbelievable. Everything smelled of smoke, from the wood floors and carpeting to the drapes. The minute our son got to our condo, he went outside and cleaned out the dryer vent for us and gave me a lecture on staying on top of this issue.
 I looked up some statistics on dryer vent fires and wasn't happy with what I read. These statistics were all up to date for last year. There is an average of 2,900 dryer vent fires a year, seven deaths a year and 344 injuries, plus $233 million in property damage. Of all home fires, 34% are caused by lint in dryer vents. Fires from the dryer occur mostly in the fall and winter months, peaking in January. Fall is coming, folks.
 Because we have cats, I clean the pull-out vent in my dryer every single time I dry a load of clothes. Some brands of dryers, such as Maytag and Whirlpool, have a check vent feature so you know when you need it to be deeper cleaned.
 I decided to be safe instead of sorry, so I made an appointment to have ours cleaned this month. Dave was the gentleman who was recommended by the fire department, and owns DuctworX Dryer Vent Cleaning. So when he showed up, I had to be nosy and ask him all kinds of questions: how often he felt it was necessary to clean the dryer, and if he had any good stories from prior homes. He actually started this business years ago when he saw smoke coming out of his vent in the rear of his house. He hadn't realized how important it was to have this job done.
 His recommendation on cleaning depended on how many years you've lived in your house, how often you use your dryer and if you have pets. Certainly going years and years without it being cleaned is not good. As far as stories go, he has found bird nests in some vents he had cleaned, and I am sure they could have started a good fire with the heat. Other vents have huge bags of lint that he removes.
 When Dave was done with ours, he showed me what he had accumulated. It was over a shoe box full of lint, and ours had been cleaned recently. Dave is fast, efficient and affordable and wears a mask. He reminded me to never leave the house or go to bed with our dryer running.
 If you start thinking about how much the cost to clean your dryer is in comparison to your insurance or what a fire would cost, you would have to agree to get the job done regularly. Your dryer will be more efficient, and you can get clothes dried much faster, saving gas or electricity. Make a safety call and contact Dave Vautsmeier at 815-275-4826. Tell him Ann sent you because she wants you to be safe.

Finally, agents also identified two Bitcoin addresses associated with an unlicensed MSB that helped AQB convert donations from cryptocurrency into fiat cash. Agents reached out to the exchange hosting those addresses and learned that they belonged to a Turkish national named Mehmet Akti, who owns and operates the unlicensed MSB. Most of the more than $1 million worth of cryptocurrency seized in this investigation comes from Akti's businesses. According to the DOJ complaint, the main address he used to run his MSB received over $80 million worth of cryptocurrency and U.S. dollar wire transfers between October 2017 and March 2019, though the majority of this was likely unrelated to terrorism financing.
