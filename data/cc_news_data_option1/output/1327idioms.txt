The coronavirus has achieved something in the blink of an eye that no amount of credible scientific evidence on the dangers of climate change could have hoped to have done: it has given us an unexpected taste of a post-development world. In this space right now, we have the opportunity to ponder the possibilities of caring (both for ourselves and the fragile planet we inhabit) and the value of minimalism (in which emotional wellbeing and happiness are prioritised over profit) in a post-development era. Perhaps, after all, medicine and philosophy have more in common than we care to admit.

WASHINGTON (AP) — House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Friday that the next coronavirus aid bill should build on the bipartisan relief bills that Congress has passed so far rather than include broader Democratic agenda items such as infrastructure and rural broadband access.
 That's a noteworthy pivot for the California Democrat, who earlier has pressed goals such as a large public works measure and restoring a deduction for state and local tax payments.
 Pelosi said in media appearances Friday that benefits for small businesses and the unemployed should be lengthened in the next coronavirus relief package. It's a way to build on Democratic gains won during talks on the most recent $2.2 trillion rescue bill, which passed Congress virtually unanimously.
 "While I'm very much in favor of doing some things we need to do to meet the needs — clean water, more broadband, the rest of that — that may have to be for a bill beyond that right now," she said during an appearance on CNBC.
 Pelosi's shift followed criticism by Republicans that she was seeking to take advantage of the crisis to try to press ambitious Democratic agenda items that couldn't pass on their own, and it came after Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell made it clear that Republicans wouldn't agree to such add-ons.
 "We need a fourth bipartisan bill," Pelosi said. Her remarks came as fresh evidence arrived of the gravity of the economic crisis caused by the outbreak: The latest batch of unemployment figures showed that a record, almost decade- long streak of U.S. job growth ended last month.
 In a hallway conversation with a small group of reporters, Pelosi said that a $350 billion program to have the federal government help keep small businesses afloat should be extended, as well as unemployment insurance for the jobless and a direct payment to most Americans.
 "Let's do the same bill we just did, make some changes to make it current and correct some of the things that we'd like to see," Pelosi said. She also would like more generous aid for state and local governments facing budget crises because of plummeting sales and income tax revenues and higher costs for coronavirus response and safety net programs.
 GOP leaders across the board have lambasted Pelosi for citing the crisis as a reason to restore the federal tax deduction for state and local taxes. Putting the deduction back in place would have chiefly helped higher income earners in high tax, Democratic-run states such as California, New York, and New Jersey. The idea was widely panned and was seen as unrealistic given opposition from Republicans.

PLYMOUTH - As the only Division 3 team in the Patriot League, the Plymouth South girls basketball squad is constantly fighting an uphill battle against a schedule filled with teams that are either one or even two divisions above them.
 They struggled at times against bigger schools this winter but the Lady Panthers very nearly made it to the playoffs via the Sullivan Rule exception for teams that have a .500 record against teams in their own division or below.
 Everything came down to the Shawn P. Cotter Memorial Tournament at Abington High. Needing to win both games to qualify for more games they were able to knock off the host Abington team, 47-45, before losing to a very good Rockland High team in the championship contest.
 Rockland and Abington both made an appearance in the Division 3 playoffs. The Green Wave lost in the first round to Rockland while the Lady Bulldogs went on a great playoff run, capturing the South Sectional Championship before losing to St. Mary's at the TD Garden in the state semifinals.
 "When we played teams close to our own size we did pretty well," second-year Head Coach Matt Dellabarba said about a squad that finished with a record of 4-16 overall, 2-13 in Patriot League games. "Win or lose, I was really impressed with the way we played defense this season. In almost every game we played really strong on the defensive end of the court and I was proud of the intensity we displayed.
 "We held Whitman-Hanson to 14 points in the first half of one game and Pembroke didn't score a basket from the field in the fourth quarter of another contest," Dellabarba said. "And then against Hingham we were able to hold 1,000-point scorer Grace Bennis to just one basket for the entire game."
 Plymouth South will graduate only two players off the roster. The bad news is the two players leaving, co-captains Teja Andrews and Kendall McDonald, have been huge cornerstone members of the program for the last four years.
 "Kendall was out the last part of the season and we really missed her maturity on the court," Dellabarba said about the four-year varsity player and three- year starter. "She always had a calm presence about her no matter what was happening on the court."
 And then there's Teja.
 A four-year varsity starter, Andrews has been a key part of the gameplan since the first day she pulled on a Panther uniform. The multiple-time Patriot League all-star got better each season and scored 360+ points in her senior campaign, finishing with 972 points over her memorable career.
 "There wasn't anything she didn't do for us. She gave the team so many things that you cannot replace," Dellabarba said about Andrews who averaged 18 points, 7.9 rebounds, two steals and 1.5 assists per game her senior year. "And she was as good of a leader as she is a basketball player.
 "I'll always remember a group text she sent to everyone on the team before the Abington game when we were still in the running for a playoff spot," Dellabarba said. "She texted everyone 'We are going to win tonight' and then she went out and helped make it happen.
 "Teja wanted to win as much as anyone as I have ever coached. She led us in scoring just about every game but she never cared about her own numbers. She just wanted to win."
 South has some solid building blocks in place as they try to get back into tourney contention with four juniors, five sophomores and a freshman from this year's team ready to carry the torch forward.
 The building starts with returning junior co-captain Cat Sullivan, who can play both guard and forward and averaged seven rebounds per game this season. Junior Braley Quigg is a strong defender and one of the best athletes in the entire program. Junior Alyssa Kane stepped into a larger role when McDonald went down with an injury and junior Alyssa Briggs is the team's top post defender.
 Dellabarba was also impressed with the play of freshman guard Sarah Kenney, saying the solid outside shooter "has just scratched the surface" about what she'll be able to do with the program.
 "The key now is what they do in the off-season," Dellabarba said. "They need to keep a basketball in their hands and keep working on developing their court skills."

 I know how to prepare for a disaster.
 My first job as a photojournalist was in Florida, where on top of weathering hurricanes, I covered them. When the coronavirus began to get close to the United States, I thought I was ready. I had food, medicine and first-aid kits to get me through.
 But nothing could have prepared me for the pandemic we're now experiencing, including my own positive COVID-19 test.
 A lot of people are blaming us, the media, saying we're creating panic out of nothing. But that's not true. This is a real crisis that is affecting the entire world. People tend not to believe what is really happening out there until they have someone close to them suffering the consequences. I wanted to share my story as a journalist and a human to show no one is exempt from this.
 If they don't believe the news, they should at least believe the people who are telling their own stories of suffering with this vicious illness. Even now, I'm dictating this from my hospital bed to a colleague who is helping me craft my story.
 When the pandemic started to get serious in early March, my newspaper, the Austin American-Statesman, sent employees home. Reporters and editors set up new work spaces: commandeering kitchen tables, countertops and even back porches. But I'm a photographer, and we can't work from home. Our place is out there, taking photos and videos of what is going on in the community. The closest thing we ever get to an office is our cars.
 I was washing my hands raw, wiping down every surface I touched and never going to an assignment without my hand sanitizer. I wore a mask and gloves.
 On March 19, I spent a few hours along Lady Bird Lake talking to the fitness enthusiasts who had flocked to the trail after local gyms shut their doors. They ran shoulder-to-shoulder and took turns using workout equipment in the park. I stood 6 feet away when I spoke with them and sanitized everything I could. But from there, things started to go downhill. That night I developed a fever of nearly 102 degrees, but in the morning it was gone. The next night, the fever came again, and suddenly the pain in my body was unbearable, as if a truck had hit me. Twice.
 I still wanted to work, to document the unprecedented shutdown of our usually vibrant city. I spent three hours the next day, between midnight and 3 a.m., with no one around, documenting the shuttered storefronts of downtown Austin. The pain became excruciating. I knew something was wrong and wondered if I had the virus.
 That weekend I began to develop a dry cough and decided to seek medical attention. A nurse at an urgent care clinic suggested I fill out an online medical questionnaire from Baylor Scott & White, which diagnosed me as having some type of viral infection. I asked to be tested for the coronavirus, but instead they prescribed me some medication to numb my throat and lungs and told me to take Tylenol and rest. They even suggested a spoonful of honey to soothe my throat.
 After the weekend, I felt somewhat better, and because the doctors told me it was a common virus, I returned to work wearing a mask and gloves and kept distance from any subjects I photographed.
 The night of March 24, the symptoms, especially my cough, started to get worse, to the point I could barely move throughout my apartment. Even going to the bathroom was a challenge; the shortest walk left me coughing uncontrollably and unable to catch my breath. I began to lose my sense of taste and smell. I texted my boss, and she told me to work from home. I stayed home working on a video, assisting other photographers by translating some interviews done in Spanish.
 The next day, I was instructed via video chat to visit another clinic, where they would be able to X-ray my lungs and possibly test me for COVID-19. At the open-air clinic, a nurse said I still wasn't meeting the criteria for a test, even though I had a history of asthma. She said they were reserving the limited supply of test kits for people older than 65 with severe medical conditions.
 They sent me home with orders to take Tylenol and drink plenty of fluids, and they gave me an emergency inhaler to use as needed.
 But at home, things got worse. My coughing fits would last 10 to 15 minutes. I began to lose weight because I had no appetite. My chest was in absolute pain. Sometimes I was coughing to the point that I was crying and vomiting. I felt as if my chest, head and eyes were going to explode.
 I hardly moved for the next few days. Though my fever had subsided, my respiratory symptoms were getting worse. I slept for 12 hours a night. I lost 4 pounds in 10 days.
 On March 28, I tried the digital questionnaire again with Baylor Scott & White but was again denied the test. They diagnosed me with acute bacterial sinusitis, gave me a prescription for an antibiotic and suggested more rest.
 Nothing helped. I took puffs of my inhaler every 10 minutes, even though it's only intended to be used twice a day. I needed help.
 I hadn't left my apartment since March 25, but on Tuesday, I made my fifth attempt to get tested. At an open-air clinic, the nurses said my vital signs were out of control. I couldn't stop coughing. They wanted to call an ambulance to take me to the emergency room, but I couldn't afford the added cost. I drove myself to the emergency room of St. David's South Austin Medical Center.
 On the way, I called my sister Laura, who lives in Florida. We were both crying. When I got to the ER, they were waiting for me.
 As the doctors began to attend to me, I couldn't help but think, \"This is it.\" My chest was completely shut down, my body going numb from low oxygen levels. I felt as if an elephant were sitting on my chest. That moment was absolutely terrifying. I truly believed I was about to die.
 They stabilized me quickly and said they would try to test me. But an hour later, they said I couldn't get a test. They wanted to send me home -- for the fifth time. I was exhausted, both mentally and physically, but I didn't budge. Eventually, they agreed to test me, which requires someone shoving a long cotton swab deep into my nose to reach the back of my throat. I cried out in pain when they did it.
 The next morning, the test came back positive.
 I'm normally a healthy 42-year-old. I run at least 6 miles every day, take good care of myself and don't smoke. As a photojournalist, I consider it my duty to run toward the fire, rather than away from it, but my colleagues and I have put ourselves at grave risk to document what is happening to our town.
 I know medical personnel are doing everything they can to help, but this crisis is serious, it's real, and it's going to affect all of us. The stories the doctors and nurses are telling are important, too. As they urge us all to stay home, I do, too. Take care of yourself, take care of those at home with you, and take care of everybody else around you.
 This virus is killing people of all ages, not only sick and old people. You might think you are not at risk, but you won't know until you are in a hospital fighting for your life.

 A Hector woman appeared in Renville County court March 30 and is facing one count of second-degree murder and one count of second-degree manslaughter.
 Elizabeth Perry Lynch, 35, of Hector made her first appearance following an incident that occurred March 26 which resulted in the death of a Hector man.
 That individual was identified by the Hennepin County medical examiner's office as Anthony Tebben of Hector.
 According to the criminal complaint, the defendant called Renville County dispatch stating she had shot her boyfriend.
 A number of law enforcement officers responded to a residence located in Hector.
 According to the report, the first officer on the scene recognized the defendant and observed that her right hand and wrist were covered in blood. Additional officers on the scene secured the defendant, while the initial officer on the scene entered the residence and found the victim on the floor.
 The officer observed his breathing was labored. The defendant was transported to the Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis where he was pronounced dead.
 In the residence, the initial officer discovered a black semi-automatic handgun that it appeared may have been the weapon involved.
 The officer also found children of various ages upstairs who were later taken into protective custody by social services.
 The defendant agreed to be transported to the Renville County sheriff's office to give a voluntary statement. Later the defendant was interviewed when she allegedly told law enforcement officers that she had gone to Montevideo where she purchased the gun.
 The defendant also allegedly stated she and the victim had argued leading up to the shooting, and that the victim had thrown a plate at her. The defendant also allegedly stated the victim had become aggressive, which led to her pointing the gun at him, although she allegedly told offers she did not intend to shoot him.
 The complaint states the defendant also said she did not even know if the gun was loaded.
 The defendant was ultimately placed under arrest and taken to the Renville County jail.
 During the defendant's first appearance before Judge Dwayne Knutsen bail was set at $500,000 without conditions and $200,000 without conditions. The second-degree murder charge, which is a felony, has a maximum sentence of 35 years in jail, while the second-degree manslaughter charge, also a felony, has a maximum sentence of 10 years, a $20,000 fine or both.
 The defendant is scheduled to make her next court appearance April 24 at 10 a.m.
 The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension and Renville County Sheriff's Department are assisting the Hector Police Department with the investigation.

ASHEBORO -- A local Asheboro attorney revealed that he has been "presumed positive" for COVID-19, while his wife was confirmed positive after being tested.
   
 According to Ed Bunch, of Bunch & Robbins law firm, his wife, Nancy Bunch, suddenly became sick on March 18.
   
 The pair had just returned from traveling in Europe and Nancy, who works at Randolph Health, had been directed to quarantine for 14 days, "not because she had symptoms, but because we had traveled," Ed said.
   
 On March 18, "She had walked three miles that morning and ate lunch with me," Ed explained in an email to The Courier-Tribune. "About a half hour later, she had a raging fever."
   
 Ed said Nancy's symptoms began that day.
   
 "Besides the fever, she had a sore throat, a cough and body aches," he said.
   
 Nancy called her doctor at White Oak Family Physicians and was asked to do a flu test. She was swabbed for the flu test and for the coronavirus test that afternoon.
   
 "The flu test came back negative that day," Ed said. "The coronavirus sample was sent to LabCorp, and the results came back nine days later," on March 27.
   
 By that time, Ed was sick, too. He awoke with a fever on March 26.
   
 "I assumed that I had whatever she had," he said. "The next day, she received her results and had tested positive for the coronavirus."
   
 Ed said Nancy called the Randolph County Health Department, who had been monitoring Nancy since she was first swabbed, and told them about Ed's situation and symptoms.
   
 "She asked whether I should be tested," Ed said. "She was told no, that I would be presumed positive."
   
 Ed had already been quarantining, but the health department asked that he continue, due to Nancy's positive result and his symptoms.
   
 Over two weeks after she first showed signs of the virus, Ed shared that Nancy is doing better. She hasn't had a fever since April 1, but Ed said he is still fighting a low-grade fever and a persistent cough. Both are still feeling "pretty weak and washed out."
   
 "I really had no preconceptions as to what the virus would feel like, but it has been a lot like the flu for us," Ed said. "We have kept up with reports about this, and we hope that it doesn't develop into a respiratory crisis or pneumonia, as that seems to be what sends people to the hospitals."
   
 Though they haven't been able to pinpoint where they picked up the virus, they traveled just before Nancy contracted symptoms.
   
 Ed said that he, Nancy and two others flew to London on March 5, to Paris on March 9, to Philadelphia on March 12 and to Raleigh/Durham on March 12.
   
 "None of us felt sick nor had symptoms while traveling," he said.
   
 While Ed said they had considered the possibility of contracting the virus while traveling, they didn't panic. The pair was celebrating their 40th wedding anniversary, Ed said, and "having the time of our lives with friends."
   
 "We each had hand sanitizer. The subway or metro in Paris was too crowded, so we traveled by Uber after experiencing that," he said. "We didn't watch the news while traveling."
   
 Despite their caution, they still ended up sick. Now, Ed is taking the time to warn others that the virus is "very real."
   
 "We know that the response to this public health crisis can seem unnecessary and over the top to people who are not sick, do not have any symptoms and do not know anyone who has contracted the virus," he said. "This is very real, however.
   
 "The scary part about this virus is that there currently is not an effective medical treatment nor a cure."
   
 Ed and Nancy strongly recommend that the orders entered by the governor and recommended by public health officials be followed to minimize the impact of the crisis.
   
 "We plan to recover from this," Ed said. "When we beat it, we will look for any opportunity to donate blood, plasma or antibodies so that treatments and a vaccine can be developed to help others."

New York, April 4 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 4th Apr, 2020 ) :A military hospital ship which arrived in New York City on Monday is fighting to stay in a coronavirus-free "bubble" so as not to risk bringing the disease on board, its medical officer said.
 The 1,000-bed USNS Comfort, previously deployed to conflict and natural disaster zones, was sent to Manhattan to ease the strain on health centers in the city at the epicenter of America's outbreak by caring for patients other than those diagnosed with the virus.
 By Friday it had received 21 patients, according to the ship's press officer Lieutenant Commander Amelia Umayam.
 "We consider the USNS Comfort to be in a bubble," said medical officer Captain Patrick Amersbach as he explained the procedures followed by the ship's crew to shield it from the virus, including not disembarking for as long as it is docked.
 Patients are arriving directly from New York hospitals and will be screened in advance to make sure they are free of the coronavirus.

All that aside, the coronavirus is affecting a lot of us in different ways and it's been seen when it comes to entertainment that we continue to discuss it over and over since, being realistic, it's basically shut down a lot of things that would normally be running full tilt. There's an option here though, to be depressed and anxious as a result of not being able to do everything we want, much as the Emperor is in this clip, or to make the most of it, laugh, and just find a way to enjoy being home for an extended period of time, especially if you still get to work from home. Those that don't get to work at all and aren't making money are hopefully finding their way to unemployment or possibly finding alternatives that can keep earning them a paycheck since there are plenty of online jobs out there if a person knows where to look. It might sound easier than it is but at the very least it's something to do and something to take a person's mind off the mind-numbing boredom and possible depression that might otherwise come quite naturally. This is a hard time for everyone right now and we're doing our best just to get through it, and right now entertainment is one of the best ways to at least attempt to push through and make the best of a seriously messed-up situation. One can only imagine just what's going to happen when people are finally allowed to go back to work and told that the virus is either on its way out or gone. At that point there might be businesses that no longer know how to handle a crowd and will have to get the hang of it once again. But hopefully it won't take that long.

PARIS Doug Hunt is taking physical distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic to new heights.
 By day, the Brantford man handles marketing and promotion for Participation Support Services, a residential home and organization that provides support for people with cerebral palsy and other disabilities in the community.
 But, as a sideline, Hunt is known widely as an entertainer and Guinness World Record holder for stilt walking. He achieved that record in 2002 when we took 25 forward steps on stilts that measured a tad over 50 feet tall. He also set a world record in 2008 when he led more than 600 people, all on stilts, around the track at North Park Collegiate.
 Hunt donned a red tailcoat and top hat Friday afternoon as he strutted, danced and juggled atop his stilts for a small group of residents sitting outside Revera's Telfer Place in Paris.
 "I was happy to be asked. It was a new experience for me," said Hunt. "In these extraordinary times, you get unusual entertainment."
 Hunt, who grew up in Paris, said he feels a connection with the retirement home and long- term care facility on Grand River Street North. His mother, Irene, and sister Valerie both lived at the facility for a number of years.
 "All of the LTCs have a day where they bring in some sort of entertainment," Hunt noted. "When you can't bring people in and do what they normally do, adding something fun and different gives them a lift. It's good medicine in more ways than people realize."
 Darlene Barber, executive director at Telfer Place, said they are going to try to do something fun every Friday, getting residents outdoors to enjoy some fresh air and sunshine.
 "It puts a little spunk in their step," Barber said. "We're bringing some happiness to the residents who can't have visitors."
 Among the Telfer Place residents gathered outside was Jack Bawcutt, former mayor of Paris prior to its amalgamation into the County of Brant.
 Bawcutt, now 96 years, said Hunt's performance was good.
 "It was nice of him to come over and do this for us," he said. "I give full marks for the staff here at Telfer Place. They're working so hard to look after us."
 Hunt said afterwards that one of the home's staff walked around the perimeter of the building with him.
 "She was thrilled to see the residents laughing, which they haven't done for a long time," he observed. "It's a tough situation, so I think adding a little fun and laughter is an important component of care, to keep people's spirits up."

I like to help out now when I can and they have been so helpful to me which is much needed when you're getting into farming. I am very fortunate to have good neighbours too, especially at Coedmolion Farm who have been very helpful.
 Over the years I have been able to save up to buy my own farm with my partner Barrie and we've built up 26 pedigree Hereford cattle. Well, 27 by the time you read this but more of that later.
 I have bought the land, shed, animals and have started from scratch.I have named it the Mairwen herd pedigree, after my mother Rhachel Mairwen. It has a nice little ring to it and means a lot obviously. It was suggested to me as an idea by Neil, a friend who has helped me with the shed design and set up.
 Our first calf was due today and I was so nervous and up every couple of hours during the night. We realised she was getting close and I have never been so nervous. Refereeing the World Cup final was a walk in the park compared to it I can tell you. Barrie was more composed then me. He was brilliant.

 Just last week, the Army chartered 32 buses to carry 812 new soldiers from Fort Jackson, South Carolina, where they had finished basic combat training, to Fort Lee, Virginia, to start quartermaster and logistics training. A similar caravan will take medic trainees from Oklahoma to Texas.
 Maj. Gen. Lonnie Hibbard, commanding general of the Army Center for Initial Military Training, said people ask why the Army is still recruiting and training during a pandemic.
 “We have to,” he said, adding it can be done with minimal risk to health and safety. “It’s our responsibility to America right now.”

Pollux and Castor are two fairly bright stars not far apart on the face of the night sky, prominent on April evenings. These two are considered the "heads" in the constellation, Gemini the Twins.      They're not exactly identical twins.      Despite the bright moonlight this week, they stand out, high in the southern sky between 8 and 9 p.m. (daylight savings time) They are visible most of the night, setting in the northwest a little after 3 a.m.      Orion, the majestic constellation with its famed trio of stars marking Orion's Belt, can be used to point right at Pollux and Castor. Orion is a bit lower, in the south-southwest around 8-9 p.m. Trace an imagined line from Orion's bright blue-white star Rigel at lower right of the "Belt," through the bright red star Betelgeuse at upper left of the "Belt." Continue this line to the upper left, to the Castor and Pollux duo.      (Betelgeuse, by the way, has triumphantly regained its brightness after a few months of unusual dimness this winter.)      Pollux is the brightest of the two "heads" of the Twins, and the lower one (assuming you aren't in the Southern Hemisphere where the perspective is turned on its head). The star's color is light yellow-orange. In 2006, a planet about 2.3 times the mass of Jupiter, was discovered circling the star. The International Astronomical Union has named this planet Thestias.      Castor is bluish-white and bright, but less so than Pollux. Castor's claim to fame for amateur astronomers training their backyard telescopes at the sky is that there are actually six stars in the Castor system. We see it as one, with unaided eyes. There are three pairs of binary (double) stars, orbiting around a common center of mass.      Telescopes, however, only pick up three of these stars. Two are easily seen in a small telescope; you may also find a third star, which is a lot fainter. Each of them are double stars themselves, but they are so close it takes a spectroscope, splitting the starlight into their spectrum of colors, to resolve them as double stars. They don't know anything about social distancing, a serious matter here on planet Earth lately.      The rest of the naked-eye stars making up the pattern of Gemini the Twins stretch back to the west (or right as seen on an April evening), towards Orion. There is a beautiful star cluster known as M35 located near the stars marking one of the "feet" of the Twins. M35 is easily visible in binoculars when the moon isn't around, and is a fine sight in a small telescope.      It's interesting to note that Pollux is 34 light-years from the Earth, and Castor is 51 light-years away. That means the two "heads" of Gemini the Twins are 17 light-years apart. It takes that many years for the starlight from one to reach the other. That would seem to make the Twins an incredibly immense couple of brothers.      Of course, we know that the constellations are imagined, two-dimensional patterns of our making. The stars across the sky are in three dimensions, at greatly varying distances. A space traveler heading out among the stars would observe that the constellation patterns as we know them become unrecognizable the farther we travel from the sun.      That doesn't stop us from enjoying them!      Full moon is on Tuesday, April 7. The moon will be close to its monthly perigee, when it is closest to Earth. This will make the moon appear a little larger (by 14%) and brighter (by 30%) than when the full phase happens to occur close to the moon's farthest point, apogee.      Be sure to see the trio of planets in the southeast in the hour before dawn. From left are Mars, (which is reddish), Saturn and Jupiter (which appears as the brightest). Venus is extremely bright in the evening, in the western sky.   Keep looking up at the sky!      Peter Becker is managing editor at The News Eagle in Hawley, Pennsylvania.

I know how to prepare for a disaster.
   
 My first job as a photojournalist was in Florida, where on top of weathering hurricanes, I covered them. When the coronavirus began to get close to the United States, I thought I was ready. I had food, medicine and first-aid kits to get me through.
   
 But nothing could have prepared me for the pandemic we're now experiencing, including my own positive COVID-19 test.
   
 A lot of people are blaming us, the media, saying we're creating panic out of nothing. But that's not true. This is a real crisis that is affecting the entire world. People tend not to believe what is really happening out there until they have someone close to them suffering the consequences. I wanted to share my story as a journalist and a human to show no one is exempt from this.
   
 If they don't believe the news, they should at least believe the people who are telling their own stories of suffering with this vicious illness. Even now, I'm dictating this from my hospital bed to a colleague who is helping me craft my story.
   
 When the pandemic started to get serious in early March, my newspaper, the Austin American-Statesman, sent employees home. Reporters and editors set up new work spaces: commandeering kitchen tables, countertops and even back porches. But I'm a photographer, and we can't work from home. Our place is out there, taking photos and videos of what is going on in the community. The closest thing we ever get to an office is our cars.
   
 I was washing my hands raw, wiping down every surface I touched and never going to an assignment without my hand sanitizer. I wore a mask and gloves.
   
 On March 19, I spent a few hours along Lady Bird Lake talking to the fitness enthusiasts who had flocked to the trail after local gyms shut their doors. They ran shoulder-to-shoulder and took turns using workout equipment in the park. I stood 6 feet away when I spoke with them and sanitized everything I could. But from there, things started to go downhill. That night I developed a fever of nearly 102 degrees, but in the morning it was gone. The next night, the fever came again, and suddenly the pain in my body was unbearable, as if a truck had hit me. Twice.
   
 I still wanted to work, to document the unprecedented shutdown of our usually vibrant city. I spent three hours the next day, between midnight and 3 a.m., with no one around, documenting the shuttered storefronts of downtown Austin. The pain became excruciating. I knew something was wrong and wondered if I had the virus.
   
 That weekend I began to develop a dry cough and decided to seek medical attention. A nurse at an urgent care clinic suggested I fill out an online medical questionnaire from Baylor Scott & White, which diagnosed me as having some type of viral infection. I asked to be tested for the coronavirus, but instead they prescribed me some medication to numb my throat and lungs and told me to take Tylenol and rest. They even suggested a spoonful of honey to soothe my throat.
   
 After the weekend, I felt somewhat better, and because the doctors told me it was a common virus, I returned to work wearing a mask and gloves and kept distance from any subjects I photographed.
   
 The night of March 24, the symptoms, especially my cough, started to get worse, to the point I could barely move throughout my apartment. Even going to the bathroom was a challenge; the shortest walk left me coughing uncontrollably and unable to catch my breath. I began to lose my sense of taste and smell. I texted my boss, and she told me to work from home. I stayed home working on a video, assisting other photographers by translating some interviews done in Spanish.
   
 The next day, I was instructed via video chat to visit another clinic, where they would be able to X-ray my lungs and possibly test me for COVID-19. At the open-air clinic, a nurse said I still wasn't meeting the criteria for a test, even though I had a history of asthma. She said they were reserving the limited supply of test kits for people older than 65 with severe medical conditions.
   
 They sent me home with orders to take Tylenol and drink plenty of fluids, and they gave me an emergency inhaler to use as needed.
   
 But at home, things got worse. My coughing fits would last 10 to 15 minutes. I began to lose weight because I had no appetite. My chest was in absolute pain. Sometimes I was coughing to the point that I was crying and vomiting. I felt as if my chest, head and eyes were going to explode.
   
 I hardly moved for the next few days. Though my fever had subsided, my respiratory symptoms were getting worse. I slept for 12 hours a night. I lost 4 pounds in 10 days.
   
 On March 28, I tried the digital questionnaire again with Baylor Scott & White but was again denied the test. They diagnosed me with acute bacterial sinusitis, gave me a prescription for an antibiotic and suggested more rest.
   
 Nothing helped. I took puffs of my inhaler every 10 minutes, even though it's only intended to be used twice a day. I needed help.
   
 I hadn't left my apartment since March 25, but on Tuesday, I made my fifth attempt to get tested. At an open-air clinic, the nurses said my vital signs were out of control. I couldn't stop coughing. They wanted to call an ambulance to take me to the emergency room, but I couldn't afford the added cost. I drove myself to the emergency room of St. David's South Austin Medical Center.
   
 On the way, I called my sister Laura, who lives in Florida. We were both crying. When I got to the ER, they were waiting for me.
   
 As the doctors began to attend to me, I couldn't help but think, "This is it." My chest was completely shut down, my body going numb from low oxygen levels. I felt as if an elephant were sitting on my chest. That moment was absolutely terrifying. I truly believed I was about to die.
   
 They stabilized me quickly and said they would try to test me. But an hour later, they said I couldn't get a test. They wanted to send me home -- for the fifth time. I was exhausted, both mentally and physically, but I didn't budge. Eventually, they agreed to test me, which requires someone shoving a long cotton swab deep into my nose to reach the back of my throat. I cried out in pain when they did it.
   
 The next morning, the test came back positive.
   
 I'm normally a healthy 42-year-old. I run at least 6 miles every day, take good care of myself and don't smoke. As a photojournalist, I consider it my duty to run toward the fire, rather than away from it, but my colleagues and I have put ourselves at grave risk to document what is happening to our town.
   
 I know medical personnel are doing everything they can to help, but this crisis is serious, it's real, and it's going to affect all of us. The stories the doctors and nurses are telling are important, too. As they urge us all to stay home, I do, too. Take care of yourself, take care of those at home with you, and take care of everybody else around you.
   
 This virus is killing people of all ages, not only sick and old people. You might think you are not at risk, but you won't know until you are in a hospital fighting for your life.

La Cina è stata subito al centro dell’attenzione mediatica e subito si è chiesto se il Covid-19 era la Chernobyl di Xi Jinping, se la Cina sarebbe crollata, se era iniziato il decoupling, la fine di Chimerica e della globalizzazione. Dal 2017 America First ha dichiarato guerra alla globalizzazione e la Cina di Xi ha sostituito gli Usa come paese guida della globalizzazione con la BRI in Asia ed Europa. Chimerica però era già finita da tempo. Chimerica, la relazione simbiotica tra Cina e America, sarebbe finita, come prevedeva Niall Ferguson, quando i cinesi non si sarebbero più accontentati di assemblare nuovi Apple americani e avrebbero iniziato a sviluppare la propria tecnologia e strategia commerciale, e il proprio soft power. Niall Ferguson, come Graham Allison, l’inventore della “trappola di Tucidide”, ha consigliato a Trump di non cadere nella trappola di Tucidide, di non ripetere l’errore del Regno Unito, quando per timore della potenza tedesca, decise la prima guerra mondiale, mentre l’impero britannico poteva convivere tranquillamente con la Germania egemone nell’Europa continentale.

Our governor's "shelter in place" order has changed the way we live. Rather than meeting people at church or in the coffee shop, I've been meeting people on Zoom. Pastoral visitation has not happened in people's homes but on our phones. I and others have been calling our church family, checking on their health and seeing if they need groceries or meds. Many of these members are older and, to a person, they are doing remarkably well. They are a resilient bunch.      It turns out that many of our older members were spending most of their time at home, even before the governor's order. The pandemic has not affected them in the same way it affects the soccer mom, who puts 25,000 miles a year on her van, or the retired couple who eat out five nights a week.      While our church family is doing well, the question on their minds, and their friends' and neighbors' minds, is: How long will this last? They want to know what's coming next and when things are going to return to normal.      All of us have a sort of inner gravity that constantly pulls us back toward normal, even when normal is not healthy. When will things be normal again? Our routines, which always have suffered interruptions, have now been turned on their heads. Everything has changed.      The pandemic has highlighted the limits of our ability to control the future. When we are in our usual routines, we assume we know what is coming next. Now, we are painfully aware that we don't. When normalcy finally returns, that awareness is likely to dissolve like a mist.      However, when the awareness of our limits dissolves, the limits themselves remain. As long as our routines are in full swing and our rhythms uninterrupted, we can overlook those limits. We may even congratulate ourselves that our crystal ball readings have been spot-on. Nevertheless, human beings are not, and never have been, good at controlling the future.      When I was a schoolboy, life suddenly changed in my household. My dad, who had been drinking and hanging out with a rowdy crowd, gave up alcohol. Previously, he was gone most evenings playing softball, bowling or playing cards and, always, drinking. Now he was playing catch with my brother and me. We were going fishing together. We even went camping.      The future must have seemed brighter to my mother. It certainly seemed more orderly. We got into a routine of sorts. The uncertainty of the past was gradually replaced by confidence in the future.      It was short-lived. Even at that time, unperceived by my parents, a white blood cell in my brother Kevin's body was damaged and began growing and dividing uncontrollably. He had leukemia.      I don't know how long this went on before my parents noticed something was amiss. For a while, life continued normally. Kevin seemed to have everything going for him. He was a gifted athlete, popular at school, and was loved by kids and adults alike. Then the sky came crashing in.      There was no warning that life was about to change. But that's the way it is. The future only occasionally issues warnings. Usually, it is stubbornly silent. Our confidence concerning the future is built on shaky ground. Even now, some reader's (or the writer's) cells may be dividing uncontrollably, and there is no indication of what is coming.      If COVID-19 helps us come to terms with this fundamental uncertainty, we will have wrestled some good out of a bad situation. If we are able to replace a wispy confidence in the future by a secure confidence in God, we will stand on firmer ground. Oswald Chambers confessed, "Faith doesn't always know where it is being led," then added, "… but it does love and know the one that's leading."      It is ironic. When our routines are in place and we think we have everything in hand, our confidence in the future is set to betray us. But when our routines have been upended and we're not sure what's coming next, our confidence in God can enable us to face the future with courage and peace.

THERE have been growing concerns that thousands of tourists who initially planned to attend the now cancelled Easter In The Country extravaganza will still arrive in Roma next weekend.
 Easter In The Country president Jenny Flynn announced on March 18 that Roma’s biggest event of the year would no longer go ahead in light of rapidly escalating COVID-19 concerns.
 This resulted in eager travellers taking to social media with good intentions that they would still come to Roma to “make their own fun”.
 The committee said while they regretted that the event had to be cancelled, it was a decision in the best interest for the health of the community.
 While the Maranoa Regional Council has not closed its borders, it joined the contingent of Western Queensland Alliance of Councils telling tourists to stay away in the hopes it will prevent an outbreak near vulnerable remote medical services.
 We spoke to many of the local accommodation providers in our region and this is what they had to say:
 Karen Blackman at Starlight Motor Inn said “all of our booked guests for Easter have cancelled.”
 Owners and managers, Sue and Steve at Villa Holiday Park said, “as per government restrictions for travel we called all bookings and cancelled them. We cannot take tourists for any reason.”
 Owner of the Overlander Motel, Amanda Weyman-Jones said “all Easter in the Country bookings have cancelled, plus every coach tour for the year.”
 The Queen of Arms Hotel said, “we had a few rooms booked for Easter weekend, but all ours have cancelled.”
 Dianne from Motel Carnarvon said “all of our Easter in the Country bookings have been cancelled.”
 Leigh from Mid Town Motor Inn said “all our rooms have been cancelled for Easter.”
 Charlie Eames from Roma Central Motel said “All our rooms for Easter have been cancelled (full refund of course) and the few other moteliers I have spoken to are the same.
 “In saying that we are all still operating for essential travelers accommodation needs which there could be a limited need.”
   * Other venues will be added to the list as they confirm.

Located in southwest province of Balochistan, Gwadar Port began to play a new role as economical transit stop and time-saving trade port for land-locked Afghanistan when it shipped fertilizer in January.
 As Pakistan entered lockdown last week, the port followed relevant rules and put on hold some of the projects in the nearby Free Trade Zone.
 Construction of a steel tube factory has been halted and a business center has been closed as precautions to stop the novel coronavirus from spreading. Business development to attract foreign investors has also come to a temporary halt.
 The port itself has been sealed off to outsiders and the number of non- essential visits has been cut to a minimum.
 However, the pandemic is unlikely to have a long-term impact on the port's development, which is measured on a scale of years rather than months.
 Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said in a recent interview with the Global Times that CPEC construction won't be impacted in the long run, although in the short run it could face some slowdown.
 "As soon as we are over the hump of dealing with the coronavirus, I think we'll be back on track," Qureshi said. "After the temporary dip, things will come back quickly. And the entire region stands to benefit from the projects."
