Multi-racial individuals like Aurora, currently face the worst odds of finding a donor due to their genetic make up, alongside the lack of availability, which is why it is so important to spread awareness and encourage everyone to sign up. Reach out to those you know with friends in high places, and spread knowledge of how important this is. Not just for Aurora, but for all those people in the same position as her, who are at a disadvantage because of their ethnicity.

 As the remainder of the schedule looms, the defense is going to need Basham to continue showing 1st round flashes, as his efforts could keep them in games late.

 Argyle were the greater threat from there on in, but they could not find a way through Hull’s well-organised defence.

Tony Mowbray said Blackburn “lacked a bit of nous” after 10-man Cardiff left Ewood Park with a 0-0 draw.


  Nothing could separate the sides, with chances few and far between, but Lee Tomlin’s 69th-minute sending off for a second bookable offence since the interval gave the hosts renewed hope of stretching their winning run to three.


  But they could not take advantage of that hope, as Tomlin’s team-mates produced a composed defensive performance that meant they left Ewood with a second goalless draw in successive seasons, without really being troubled.


  Adam Armstrong had a first-half effort well saved by Alex Smithies, but that was it for gilt-edged chances.


  Rovers remain sixth and have not conceded in three league games. Mowbray said his team can take positives but was unhappy that they could not find a winner.


  He said: “We’re all very disappointed. You’ve got to give them huge credit. They made it difficult for us.


  “They’re a very, very experienced team. It was a difficult game, we knew it was going to be difficult because we couldn’t play to our strengths and yet when we got asked in the last 20 minutes to break down a packed defence, we didn’t have the answers really.

As an emergency department physician, it saddens me but I have come to terms with the fact that some people get awful cancers. Or that car accidents can change a person’s life in a split second and trampolines cause the craziest fractures. What I have not been able to come to terms with is watching a young child struggle and turn blue as they are unable to breathe, or trying to care to an elderly patient who eventually dies when the diseases they suffer from are ones that can prevented by one of the safest things we do in medicine — routine vaccination.


  As a parent, vaccinating was hard. Holding my young, perfect child and allowing a stranger to stick a needle in her leg and hear her cry was not easy. It was made worse by the drumbeat from friends and comments on social media seeding doubts that maybe someone was harming my child. Before I could do it, I had to pull back, look over the science again, and know my desire to protect my child both compelled me to get her vaccinated and made me hesitant at the same time.


  As a public health official, I am reminded daily of how the choices we make as individuals have profound effects on the health and well-being of our friends, our neighbors, and those most vulnerable in our communities, especially when it comes to the spread of infectious disease. Besides access to clean water, I cannot think of a single action that can more profoundly affect our communities’ collective health than getting vaccinated.

After the interval, Glen Rea sent a volley over the bar from a Berry set- piece, before the visitors eventually mustered some attacks of their own. Daryl Horgan’s attempt was blocked, while Joe Jacobson and Horgan sent efforts over.
 Luton then took the lead with a magnificent first goal of the season for Mpanzu, as he took Cornick’s pass and picked out the corner of the net from 22 yards, curling a beautiful effort beyond Allsop.
 In a frantic second period, opportunities came and went at both ends, James Collins volleying wildly off target for Luton before Sluga had to repel Anthony Stewart’s far-post header from a free-kick.
 Berry thought he had a second when he was picked out by Cornick and fired goalwards, only to see Allsop stick out a foot in the nick of time.
 Jacobson sent a shot wide when afforded too much room, before – at the other end – Collins was denied by Curtis Thompson on the line from close range when he simply had to score.
 Sluga parried Jack Grimmer’s effort away after the right-back overlapped well, before Cornick almost pounced on an error from Jacobson but Allsop came out to block with his legs.
 Wanderers thought they had snatched an equaliser with three minutes to go, but substitute Scott Kashket’s goal was ruled out for offside.

  Although optimistic about the future - and about Manchester Union's longevity - the proposed changes to the Small Brewer's Relief in 2022 are unnerving.


  Established in 2002, the scheme allows breweries producing under 60,000 hectolitres - about 10m pints - to pay reduced rates of duty on a sliding scale.


  The biggest beneficiaries are those with a capacity of under 5,000 hl (880,000 pints), but the lower threshold is now set to be cut to 2,100hl (370,000 pints) by 2022.


  Pressure is being applied by The Small Brewers Duty Reform Coalition, a group of more than 60 larger breweries (including Manchester's JW Lees and Joseph Holt) to overhaul the scheme.


  It's been described by the Society of Independent Brewers (SIBA) as a ' reverse Robin Hood ' system.

  The Ammies struck within two minutes through Ashley Hunter to make it back- to-back wins and preserve their unbeaten record in the fourth tier so far.

 The visitors were worthy opponents, especially in the second half, but left East Yorkshire empty-handed following Hakeeb Adelakun’s terrific volley after 10 minutes.
 Adelakun’s goal maintained Hull’s 100 per cent start to the season – they have also yet to concede – and keeps them second in League One.
 McCann said: “I’m really pleased with the result. They’re a really good team and they’re not afraid to play through you.
 “What pleased me most about performance was the way we kept going in the second half. We still created a few good chances, but we had to really dig deep.
 “They’re a good side and they’ll maybe feel a wee bit aggrieved that they didn’t come away with a draw.”
 Hull charged into an early lead when Adelakun cushioned a beautiful volley into the far corner following Keane Lewis-Potter’s perfect cross from the left.

For the first time in ecent past, election campaign has commenced without declaration of candidates of any political party.


  This is the interesting aspect of the byelection for Dubbak Assembly constituency to be held on November 3. The election is necessitated by the death of ruling party MLA Solipeta Ramalinga Reddy.


  The TRS has already taken the lead in campaigning with Finance Minister T. Harish Rao touring the constituency extensively and inaugurating a series of development programmes and announcing sanction of various development projects to the tune of several crores. However, he has been cautious enough to float the name of S. Sujatha, widow of Ramalinga Reddy.


  Cheruku Srinivas Reddy, son of late minister Ch. Muthyam Reddy has been trying his luck to get party nomination with not much response from the party leadership so far. It is not clear what path will be chosen by Srinivas Reddy, who has good following in the constituency due to the works done by his father.


  The name of Collector P Venkatarami Reddy is also doing the rounds but he was not available for comment. During 2018 general elections, he had reportedly tried for Lok Sabha ticket but missed the opportunity due to last minute changes.


  M. Raghunandana Rao of the BJP, who contested previous two elections, has been extensively visiting the villages and meeting people with a promise to grill the government on the compensation being offered to oustees of Mallannasagar coming up in Toguta mandal.

Fairbanks residents will decide Tuesday whether to approve a $1.5 million loan from the state to improve the wastewater treatment plant when they vote on Proposition A.


  Endorsing the proposition will help Golden Heart Utilities, the company that leases and manages the city’s Peger Road Wastewater Treatment Plant, find money for the improvements. If the proposition is ratified, the city will get a pass-through loan from the Alaska Clean Water fund at a $1.5 interest rate, and GHU will pay off the grant, as well as its fees and interest.


  The low-interest loan will reduce the total cost of the project and will benefit people paying GHU for utilities, according to Ordinance 6125, which put Proposition A on the ballot.
