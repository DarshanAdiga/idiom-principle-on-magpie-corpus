 Minister for Agriculture S.

He was accompanied by Managing Director of Telangana State Seed Development Corporation K. Keshavulu and others.
 The study has been taken up to encourage farmers to go for crop change with an aim to improve their income by diverting from traditional crops with which they were unable to get the expected income, an official of the visiting team said. Stating that there was huge demand for tapioca in the national and international markets, the official said it could be cultivated as an irrigated-dry crop and achieve high yield.

If all the recent chatter we've seen online turns out to be true, today could finally be the day when Sony either sends out invitations to its PS5 event or even announces some preliminary details about the PlayStation 5. At this point, it's completely unclear which route the company will take in light of the coronavirus outbreak that's still wreaking havoc. Big conferences are being canceled left and right and Sony in particular has been quick to bail on events even before they're canceled. With that in mind, it seems like the company may decide to skip the big PlayStation meeting it was undoubtedly planning. Instead, Sony could follow Microsoft's lead and make its PS5 announcements in bits and pieces. Microsoft's upcoming new Xbox Series X design was shown off first, for example, and then the company announced some specs and key Xbox Series X features just last week. Sony could easily skip its big press conference that was rumored to take place at some point in March and just start making PS5 announcements instead.

OGDEN — The updated estimated cost of rebuilding or revamping four Ogden elementary schools has jumped since the successful 2018 vote on the bond question to fund the projects.
 When put to voters in November 2018, the estimated budget to rebuild Horace Mann and T.O. Smith schools, overhaul Polk Elementary and add onto Wasatch Elementary totaled $87 million. Since then, that figure has increased to $106,451,924, a 21.2% increase.
 That’s money taxpayers will likely have to pay to keep the city’s schools up to par. Whatever the case, Jer Bates, spokesman for the Ogden School District, says the rise, stemming in part from construction inflation, isn’t a surprise and he doesn’t expect it to adversely impact other district projects. Work has already started on the Wasatch addition and the rebuild of Horace Mann. The Polk upgrade is to begin in June and the T.O. Smith rebuild is to start this coming summer or fall, according to the tentative project timeline.
 The $87 million figure was meant to be “a representation of the amount of money that the district would need to borrow to pay for the projects based on estimates at that time,” Bates said in an email to the Standard-Examiner. “It is not a surprise that the current estimated combined cost of the projects exceeds the amount of the 2018 bond, given the fact that we are in a period of significant construction cost inflation.”
 Moreover, he noted that the updated cost figures are “actual renovation costs versus estimated costs” and that school leaders are mindful of keeping spending in check. “While factors such as inflation are outside of the district’s control, we are working with our project manager, contractors and architects to get the best possible value for the project budget,” Bates said.
 Voters in the Ogden School District approved the $87 million bond in 2018 by a 56%-44% margin. Officials said the four schools needed updating to modernize the facilities and make them more resistant to earthquakes, among other things. Passage that year came a year after the narrow defeat in 2017 of an earlier $106.5 million school bond proposal by a 51%-49% margin.
 When the Ogden School Board approved the 2018 bond resolution, the estimated costs of the varied projects were $30 million at Polk, $25 million each for the Horace Mann and T.O. Smith rebuilds and $7 million for the Wasatch project. According to an update on the projects presented to school board members at a Feb. 6 work session, the estimated cost in dollar terms had increased the most on the Polk project, from $30 million to $37.15 million. The Horace Mann estimate had gone from $25 million to $29.16 million, the T.O. Smith estimate had risen from $25 million to $27.45 million and the Wasatch price tag had jumped from $7 million to $11.69 million.
 The Wasatch project required a $601,797 change order to deal with plumbing, irrigation, sidewalk, curb and gutter issues.
 The extra dollars needed could come from district capital budget funds or lease revenue bonds, which don’t require voter approval, according to Bates. He didn’t have additional details, but doesn’t expect the extra cost to impact other capital projects.
 As part of the Polk rebuild, to be finished by summer 2022, the school is to temporarily close, with students attending other schools — probably Taylor Canyon and Wasatch elementary schools. Bates said a meeting is in the works, probably later this month, to give the public more details on the plans, which are still being finalized.
 “Questions have arisen from each of these three school communities asking about the displacement from Polk Elementary. The most common inquiry is about the timetable for announcing the displacement plan. We are eager to provide this information as soon as possible as it impacts all school stakeholders — students, staff, parents, volunteers, crossing guards, bus drivers and others,” Bates said.
 Taylor Canyon is scheduled to close when the Polk rebuild is done, with students — some at least — shifting to the overhauled school.

 Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, for Mr. Fadnavis, had earlier asked for a stay of the trial court proceedings, but was refused by the Bench.
 The review petition was filed against the Bench’s judgment on October 1 last year directing a Nagpur court to continue with the trial against Mr. Fadnavis under Section125-A of the Representation of the People (RP) Act, 1951.
 The October 2019 judgment had come in an appeal filed by Satish Ukey, a lawyer, against a Bombay High Court decision that had set aside a Sessions Court go-ahead to try Mr. Fadnavis for violation of the RP Act.
 The October judgment had held that a “contesting candidate is mandated to furnish information concerning the cases in which a Competent Court has taken cognisance along with the cases in which charges have been framed”.
 The Supreme Court had interpreted Section 33-A of the 1951 Act to hold that “information” to be disclosed by a candidate includes cases of which a court had already taken cognisance.
 Mr. Rohatgi had argued that Section 33A was wrongly involved in his case.
 The Supreme Court had held that the election affidavit under Form 26 of the Conduct of Election Rules of 1961, submitted to the poll officer along with the nomination papers, should contain details of not only cases in which charges had been filed but also those which had been taken cognisance.

I did write a column to the effect that I believed Trump would be found not guilty in the eventual trial and I am not crying sour grapes here. This is just a set up for what has been going on since the impeachment trial ended. This is where the story gets really scary.
 But to start I would have to start in 2016 when Trump — while involved in a lawsuit over the legitimacy of Trump University — complained about the judge’s “Mexican heritage.” Trump’s critics took this as a sign of latent racism and I don’t disagree with them but in hindsight his statement also could have been interpreted as being indicative of his lack of respect for our legal system.
 In my opinion, if you say anything to a law officer or judge other than “yes,” “no,” “sir” or “ma’am” then you go straight to jail. Do not pass Go. Do not collect $200. That’s the level of respect that I, and presumably you, have for the process. That’s the way it has to be for our society to continue to function properly.
 Immediately after getting a speeding ticket I drive in a “chastened” manner — for a while, anyway. And you might think that after the impeachment Donald Trump might take a more chastened approach to our legal system. But…. noooo. Quite the opposite.
 Donald Trump, perceiving himself to be unbound by the legal system, has used his time to pardon one convicted felon (Rod Blagojevich), interfere with the sentencing recommendations of another (Roger Stone), criticize his own Attorney General for not going along with it, and then insist that two Supreme Court justices recuse themselves from “Trump-related” cases.
 Personally, and as a direct result of the drunken “lobster fight” that took place in the supermarket while I was in college, I consider myself to be disqualified from public service. That’s another story. But, in the meantime, I’ve got to ask how many “Trump-related” cases are we talking about? Who does this guy think he is?

The challenge with real estate is inventory. A sales representative can do all the branding and marketing they want and still end up with nothing. Consumers are not looking for a Realtor, they are looking for a property. Any sales representative will tell you that when they have the product a consumer wants the consumer comes to them with zero marketing. Having a "niche" can work but more importantly it is getting know by potential Seller's, not chasing down Buyer's, that works. When a new property comes up in my neighbourhood I never hear this. " Did you see Brokerage ABC sales representative Anyone has a property listed for sale?" Never. I do hear things like. "You know that beautiful Victorian everyone likes? It is listed for sale. Or. "Guess who just listed their house for sale?" Or. " It looks like the Jones' are moving their house just came onto the market." That is why the top sales representatives spend thousands of dollars on bill boards, print ads, news letters and print advertising. To attract Seller's so they can have an inventory to sell. It is getting into the consumer's Evoked Space to acquire an inventory of listings. Imagine a factory with nothing to sell. All the marketing in this universe will not help them.

"There is still a huge stigma attached to mental health illness which makes it difficult for people to expose and admit their feelings.  I know how hard it is to seek help.  Having student-based support is innovative, as we understand exactly the experiences of being a student in current times.  As mental health champions, we can make it easier and more comfortable to talk as we are more approachable.  We can remove the awkwardness, risk and exposure of talking to a teacher, and we are on the ground with our fellow students so we have the opportunity to see and recognise early signs of a student's struggle, and will be able to guide them to further help and support."

The former Wolverine took another step in the right direction with his performance in Saturday’s USA Western Regionals competition in Park City.
 “I had to dig deep,” Frimpong said. “To get to the top, I needed to have two good runs. In many competitions, I’d have one good run and one that was flop. That kept me from having a good combined time. I was really relaxed this past week and looked at it like it was a training opportunity.”
 Since he didn’t put as much pressure on himself, he was able to reach new heights with his performance.
 “I had my first run and pushed in 4.82 seconds, which is my fastest push time this season,” Frimpong said. “I had a 50.96 down time, which was my personal best in Park City.”
 But there was some tough competition, so he knew that he still had to be good in the second run.
 “I wanted to be consistent,” Frimpong said. “I went and pushed a 4.78, which was faster than my first push and was my personal best. I was able to work on the corners and for the first time in my life I was able to execute it really, really well. I was able to win the race by 44-hundredths of a second over the two runs. That was a big accomplishment for me.”
 He said that it was an amazing feeling to finally see all the hard work rewarded with a victory, the first ever for an African in the sport of skeleton.
 “I came across the finish line and looked at the clock and I almost didn’t believe it,” Frimpong said. “It was a chance to show that I have what it takes to do well. There has been the feeling that my efforts were just a marketing stunt or another ‘Cool Runnings’ story. But I showed I am an athlete and I can do this.”
 He said that having the help of Zach Lund, a former skeleton athlete and USA national team coach from Salt Lake City, made a big difference.

Ever watch the changing locations of the game ball during high-school basketball contests when there is a break in the action of play?
 The ball moves around a bit, and sometimes even gets lost.
 The ball ends up in various places, often in the hands, or resting on the hip, of a referee. Other times it’s on the floor somewhere, again not far from a referee – sometimes under one of their feet. The ball does roll away – once picked up by a fan in a student section. He began using it to start an impromptu volleyball match with other students in those bleachers.
 At halftime, the ball often is put somewhere on or under the scorer’s table or set on a chair in that vicinity for safekeeping, usually right in the middle so it is not misplaced. Someone is usually assigned of keeping tabs on the ball, but they often walk away. That leaves the ball unattended, and sometimes it gets grabbed and used.
 During those halftimes, youngsters often gather on the court to shoot around a bit, snatching whatever ball or balls they see. That includes the game ball on the scorer’s table. No surprise, it isn’t always returned to the right place.
 When play is set to resume, there can be a mad scramble to find that all- important game ball. Usually, the ball is found. If not, that creates an unwanted situation.
 Another ball can be substituted, certainly. That often is vehemently never to the liking of players. Every ball is a bit different in feel and texture. So there is an adjustment period for shooters. By halftime, players have already become much more comfortable with the original ball and want no part of any replacement.
 During timeouts or breaks between quarters, the ball is in possession of a referee, whereever they may be on the court. Mostly it’s just held. Every so often, a ref will fiddle with the ball a bit, maybe spinning it on a finger.

Some cultures still believe that the girl-child should be used to feed the family.

For our society to be free we have to have laws to govern the boundaries of our behavior so that we do not tread on the freedoms of others. America grants its citizens a lot of freedoms and on that basis has a lot of laws which, in theory, are applied equally and without prejudice to all of us. Unless you happen to be the President.
 There are a lot of things that disturb me about Donald Trump but the fact that he has increasingly treated the rule of law as mere suggestions has started to bother me. And I am well aware of the fact that many of you voted for the man but I’m going to give you a pass on that for today because there is no way you could have imagined this kind of behavior coming. That’s my olive branch — I just want a little critical reading ability displayed in return.
 For starters, how can you get away with obstructing justice while you are on trial for obstructing justice? In a nutshell, that’s basically what happened during the impeachment. The House of Representatives would call for a witness and the White House would deny them that witness. The House of Representatives would subpoena a document and the White House would ignore the subpoena. And on and on.
 I can accept the idea that partisan politics provided quite a bit of motivation in this process — just as it played a role in Bill Clinton’s impeachment — but I don’t believe that there are “Republican” or “Democrat” laws. There is only THE law. Donald Trump broke it and then perverted the process of inquiry into his infraction. He claimed it was a partisan issue. The law is not a partisan institution.

That the people of Syria feel that the world does not care, is understandable. They watch the USA and Turkey boldly misleading the international community and making a mockery of their suffering. They witness being treated as manipulatable statistics by Turkey and its NATO allies to justify its presence in their country; and by human rights organisations to get access to funding. They observe the murders by Israel going unchallenged. The frustration with the porousness of the system that is meant to protect them is exacerbated by the challenges of living in a conflict environment as they lose loved ones, struggle to make ends meet and are unable to comfort their traumatised children. There is a reason for the sense of despondency at the absence of decency in humanity, to run deeply.
