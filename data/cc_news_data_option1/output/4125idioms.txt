After successfully folding Kolkata Knight Riders for 167, Chennai Super Kings raced away to 90 for the loss of just one wicket at the half-way mark of the innings. Shane Watson, like in his previous innings against Kings XI Punjab, looked in fluent touch alongside fellow batsman Ambati Rayudu, who as well was playing decently against the KKR pace attack. But 10 overs later, CSK lost four more wickets for just 67 runs, a phase when they began with nine wickets in hand, losing the match by 10 runs at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi. It was all down to a tactical move from captain Dinesh Karthik.ÔøΩ Chennai have...

The Balkan Insight (fornerkt the Balkin Investigative Reporting Network, BIRN) is a close group of editors and trainers that enables journalists in the region to produce in-depth analytical and investigative journalism on complex political, economic and social themes. BIRN emerged from the Balkan programme of the Institute for War & Peace Reporting, IWPR, in 2005. The original IWPR Balkans team was mandated to localise that programme and make it sustainable, in light of changing realities in the region and the maturity of the IWPR intervention. Since then, its work in publishing, media training and public debate activities has become synonymous with quality, reliability and impartiality. A fully-independent and local network, it is now developing as an efficient and self-sustainable regional institution to enhance the capacity for journalism that pushes for public debate on European-oriented political and economic reform.

The ornate wooden homes dotting the Siberian city of Tomsk are cherished landmarks, but that hasn't prevented many from falling into disrepair following years of neglect, with some now facing demolition.
 A scattering of the iconic buildings still boast brightly-coloured and cared- for exteriors with intricate wood carvings adorning window frames and roofs.
 A large number, however, look as if they have been abandoned.
 The townhouses represent some of the finest examples of wooden architecture in the country.
 Yet historians in the city say their future is uncertain, with government support too slow to respond to the urgent need to save them and commercial interests spying prime real estate.
 Many of the homes have only survived this long because residents "were forced to live in what already existed", historian Sergei Maltsev, 46, tells AFP.
 There are around 2,000 of the historic houses in the city of 575,000 people, Maltsev says, pointing out that fewer than 100 are preserved by the state as heritage sites.
 Some fall prey to real-estate developers and can be levelled on orders from the mayor.
 Some 2,900 kilometres (1,800 miles) east of Moscow, Tomsk is one of the oldest cities in Siberia, founded in 1604 on the banks of the river Tom.
 At the beginning of the 20th century, it was a major transport hub through which merchants would pass on their way to Asia.
 \- Conservation efforts lack 'political will' -
 Traders, craftsmen and blacksmiths built hundreds of the houses made of wood -- affordable building material at the time -- to demonstrate their success.
 But the age of prosperity was short-lived.
 In the 1910s, Tomsk was stripped of its status as the regional capital in favour of a village called Novonikolaeyvsk, located some 265 km southwest, which was to become a stop on the Trans-Siberian railway.
 That settlement would later be renamed Novosibirsk, now the third largest city in Russia and a large industrial centre dominated by imposing Soviet-style buildings made of concrete blocks.
 In 2016, a project was launched aimed at establishing a historic preservation zone in Tomsk within which the wooden houses could not be destroyed.
 But the initiative has been slow to get off the ground even though Russian President Vladimir Putin last year personally instructed local government to ramp up conservation efforts.
 Maltsev puts this down to "lobbying by construction companies" or the "usual bureaucratic delays".
 Another conservation programme sees the properties rented at a symbolic price on the condition that they will be restored by their new inhabitants.
 But it is yet to have any significant impact.
 Maltsev says the programme "works" but notes it has saved fewer than 10 houses since it launched three years ago.
 "It takes a long time and there are few investors given the current economic situation," he tells AFP.
 The historian believes that only "political will" can protect the landmarks.
 He gives as an example the ongoing renovation in the town of Plyos on the Volga River where former president and prime minister Dmitry Medvedev is believed to own an estate.
 "Unfortunately, none of the big bosses are from Tomsk," Maltsev jokes.

He was in isolation and was dropped from the country‚Äôs Nations League match against Sweden on Wednesday in Lisbon.
 "Ronaldo is doing great. He is dealing very well with this,‚Äù Portugal coach Fernando Santos said. "He is asymptomatic, he has no problems. He doesn't even know how this happened to him."
 Ronaldo, one of the most prolific goal scorers in the sport's history, played in the 0-0 draw at France in the Nations League on Sunday and in the 0-0 draw against Spain in a friendly last week.
 On Monday, the Juventus forward posted a photo on Twitter and Instagram showing him and the rest of the Portugal squad having a meal together. The players were all close to each other at a table, with a smiling Ronaldo apparently taking the photo himself at the front end.
 Along with the tweet, Ronaldo wrote, in Portuguese, "United on and off the field!‚Äù
 Photos published by Portuguese media showed Ronaldo on a balcony overlooking his teammates practicing below on a field at the national team's training center. In one of the images, he was shown giving the thumbs-up sign.
 The 35-year-old Ronaldo last month became only the second male soccer player to reach 100 goals for a national team, after former Iran striker Ali Daei.
 Players who tested positive for COVID-19 recently include Neymar, Kylian Mbappe, Paul Pogba, Paulo Dybala, Angel Di Maria, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Diego Costa.
 The Portuguese federation said Ronaldo's result prompted another round of tests for the rest of the national squad. It said everyone else in the team tested negative.
 Tuesday's practice session was moved from the morning to the afternoon so there was time for all the results to come back.
 "We have done everything we were told, we have taken all precautions,‚Äù Santos said. "We are here confined. It‚Äôs like a bubble. No one is coming in or going out. In the first training period there was no problem, but now there was a problem, but not because we broke the rules. It just happened. The players are very concerned about abiding by the safety rules.‚Äù
 Santos said Ronaldo's positive result came on Monday and he remained in isolation in his room until he could be tested again on Tuesday along with the rest of the squad. He said the players have been tested seven times since they arrived.
 "Every day we have been tested and of course that leaves us with a bitter taste because we have done everything right,‚Äù he said. "We followed every health rule. Unfortunately, this still happened. That‚Äôs life.‚Äù
 Two other Portugal players, Jose Fonte and Anthony Lopes, tested positive for COVID-19 recently.
 Speaking during an official visit to Belgium, Portugal President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa said he had already wished Ronaldo the best in his recovery.
 Portugal and France lead Group 3 of the Nations League with seven points each after three matches.
 Ronaldo could miss Juventus‚Äô Serie A match at Crotone on Saturday and the team‚Äôs Champions League opener at Dynamo Kyiv next Tuesday. And depending on his condition and the results of future tests, he could also miss the much- anticipated match against Barcelona on Oct. 28.
 Juventus had been in isolation following positive tests for two staff members. There has been some controversy that Ronaldo and six other players were allowed to leave the isolated group and join their national teams.
 Portugal's next round of matches will be next month.

Baron Li, a sales manager at a Burien car dealership, said he was walking to his car to go to work on July 10 when an unknown assailant shot him 9 times from point-blank range in the parking lot of Li's Bellevue apartment complex.
 He spent a week at Seattle's Harborview Medical Center and had to use a wheelchair for a month after he was discharged, Li said in a phone interview on Tuesday, the same day King County prosecutors charged his ex-wife and two teenage alleged accomplices with premeditated attempted first-degree murder.
 Li and his ex-wife have been involved in an acrimonious custody battle over their son, who has special needs and who turned 6 in April, according to Li and court records. Police say there may be a financial motive behind the murder-for-hire plot and Li confirmed his son has a special-needs trust fund that contains "quite a bit of money."
 "I knew where the threat was coming from. It wasn't a surprise. I knew I was in her way for what she wanted and that she was capable of doing it," Li, 48, said of his ex-wife's alleged plot to have him killed.
 Prosecutors say Li's ex-wife, 30-year-old Shaerin Kelley of Mountlake Terrace, was actively plotting with one of her accomplices to "complete the job" and kill Li after their failed July attempt, according to charging papers.
 Kelley and two Mount Vernon 17-year-olds, Joseph Good and Quincy Mendez, were arrested Thursday and made their first court appearances Friday, according to prosecutors.

CLEVELAND, Ohio (WOIO) - We have a warning for drivers before you hit the road.You may be seeing less traffic on our roads still during the pandemic, but deadly crashes are up.State troopers tell 19 Investigates they‚Äôre seeing concerning changes in driver behaviors.Highways and roads were pretty empty this March through May, as many Ohioans stayed put during the governor‚Äôs stay-at-home order for coronavirus.Car crashes and state trooper enforcements dropped dramatically during that time.And the effects of the pandemic on driving continue to last.19 Investigates discovered Ohio State Highway Patrol enforcement stops statewide are down by nearly 180,000 so far in 2020 compared to the same time frame in 2019.OSHP statistics show enforcement stops at 275,567 so far in 2020 year to date, compared to 454,152 in 2019 during the same time period.Despite that, we found deadly car crashes are up this year.There have been 946 fatal crashes so far in 2020.Last year at the same time, there were 904.‚ÄúSo that‚Äôs almost 50 additional traffic fatalities, and that‚Äôs tragic, especially when we‚Äôre still not at our normal traffic levels,‚Äù said Sgt. Ray Santiago with Ohio State Highway Patrol.Latest statistics from the Ohio State Highway Patrol.In Cuyahoga County, deadly crashes are up by 18. Troopers say extreme speeding could be part of the problem.Santiago said they saw a huge spike in drivers going over 100 miles per hour during the stay at home order.‚ÄúBut what we saw with the traffic that was traveling, they were doing so at dangerous speeds, and crash severities actually increased,‚Äù he said.And that is not stopping.From January to the beginning of September, OSHP issued over 2,300 citations for drivers going over 100 miles per hour.During that same time last year, they wrote about 1,400 tickets. Distracted driving is also up and construction zone accidents are a major concern too.We found OVI stops are down by more than 5,000, but troopers say that‚Äôs not something to celebrate.‚ÄúAnytime you see a decrease in OVIs, it‚Äôs a positive. What‚Äôs not so positive is when those numbers, those statistics stay relative to the amount of traffic fatalities that we‚Äôre having. So that‚Äôs where it‚Äôs still an issue,‚Äù Santiago said.The bottom line is this-- less drivers on the road right now doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre safer.But the state troopers are trying to do their part.‚ÄúWhen we see again, traffic decreases, we should see significant decreases in all of these areas where folks are getting injured and it‚Äôs not necessarily correlating that way,‚Äù Santiago said.OSHP statistics show drug violations statewide are down so far this year from last year.But weapons violations are up by more than 100.All of this data helps state troopers figure out how to best protect you.If you‚Äôre wondering about all of that lost ticket revenue from less traffic stops, the state patrol said they don‚Äôt track it and they don‚Äôt have a dollar amount.The money doesn‚Äôt go to them, part of it goes to the state and the rest goes to the city or county where they made the stop.Copyright 2020 WOIO.

MADISON (AP) ‚Äî Vice President Mike Pence defended President Donald Trump‚Äôs nominee for the U.S. Supreme Court and his response to the coronavirus pandemic at an outdoor rally Tuesday in a conservative Milwaukee suburb before a crowd of supporters, most of whom were not wearing masks or socially distancing even as COVID-19 cases broke records in Wisconsin.
 The rally at Weldall Manufacturing in Waukesha came exactly three weeks before the election and as the Senate Judiciary Committee held confirmation hearings for Amy Coney Barrett, Trump‚Äôs pick to replace the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Supreme Court.
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to make a prediction,‚Äù Pence said. ‚ÄúJudge Amy Coney Barrett will soon be Justice Amy Coney Barrett. We‚Äôre going to fill that seat.‚Äù
 Pence said Democrat Joe Biden would ‚Äúpack the court‚Äù if he is elected president by adding seats to the Supreme Court. Biden has avoided questions for weeks about the idea that‚Äôs been pushed by liberals and used by Republicans against him.

TIVERTON -- There have been 34 calls to police since June about a coyote sighting in the populated north end of town. Sometimes it's near Pocasset School, other times it's been seen in driveways and back yards of homes, near school bus stops, along the railroad tracks on Bay Street, and near the Bourne Mill apartments on Fish Road.
 It's been photographed numerous times and videoed during the day while munching on a chicken it just caught, and at night feasting on a deer on the side of the road that had apparently been hit by a car.
 Some callers have told police dispatchers that the coyote was stalking children or following them, that it went after their dog and ate a cat.
 While some people want it to be hunted and taken away, others on social media, where there are over 400 comments about the coyote, say it's just part of nature and should be left alone.
 Animal Control Officer Jennifer Stills tried to snare it recently, but it ran away carrying its lunch in its mouth, crossed Main Road and went into a wooded area.
 Police have responded to the dozens of calls over the last four-plus months. "Coyote ran off into the woods," is how most of the communications about the calls end.
 Stills said she does not know if there is just one coyote. A mail lady in the area told her she thinks there are three.
 Sightings have been reported on Bay Street, near the Bourne Mill at least a mile away, on State Avenue at the state line with Fall River, and as far south as Lepes Road, which is a couple of blocks south of Pocasset School.
 "The one I have seen and dealt with really just pays no mind to you," said Stills of the day she was called to a Main Road home where the coyote was eating a chicken on the front lawn while being videoed by a passerby. When Stills approached it with a snare pole, it ran, taking its lunch with it.
 Officers have been directed not to shoot it if they come into contact with it.
 "Officers are not authorized to euthanize any animal unless it presents an immediate danger/threat to another person or animal," Stills said in an internal memo to police officers after speaking about the situation with Chief Patrick Jones. "Officers are also required to obtain the permission of the officer-in-charge prior to use of any firearm to put down an animal."
 There was a report in late August of a coyote nipping a child in the behind at a party in Fall River, just over the state line with Tiverton. Stills said the coyote ran through the back yard and the child ran after it. She can also confirm that one dog was nipped by a coyote. She has not personally received reports of any cats gone missing.
 Stills said Massachusetts environmental officials have talked to Rhode Island environmental officials about the "common nuisance" coyote.
 It has been seen eating cat food at a home on the Fall River side of State Avenue where a shelter and a feeding area for stray cats has been set up by the homeowner.
 "There are easy meals for it everywhere, all over the north end," said Stills. "There's trash" the coyote can easily get into, "and people let their chickens loose."
 She said the situation is one of being "between a rock and a hard place."
 "I don't see any signs of aggression," Stills said of her encounters with the coyote. "It doesn't make me feel uncomfortable. I've had run-ins with it. It scares off easily," she said.
 Parents need to educate their children not to approach the coyote if they see it, she said, and report any threatening behavior to police.

The debate over who the Greatest Player of All-Time is has gotten a large boost of fuel ever since LeBron James helped lead the Los Angeles Lakers to the 2019-20 NBA Championship, earning his 4th individual championship in his storied 17-year NBA career. Earlier this year, when 'The Last Dance' aired, voters in an ESPN poll overwhelmingly had Michael Jordan as the best player in basically every way, including passing. But after the bubble started and LeBron James put the finishing touches on a season where he led the NBA in assists while still being an elite scorer, eventually leading the Lakers to a title, the debate has new steam. LeBron, at least in conversation with the media, would be adding any.

"I have always recalled a quote I learned from Fred Bear while working at his archery shop in Grayling and shooting with him out back. He said pick a spot on the animal and aim at that; never look at the whole animal. That quote always stuck with me and I use it every time. That's what I taught you kids to do.
 "I was just very happy to have the opportunity to get out to the blind,‚Äù continued Adlen.
 Pratt‚Äôs 12-year-old daughter, Autumn, and her brother, Rick, helped with the hunt, too.
 ‚ÄúMy daughter could have gone instead of my dad, but Autumn told me that if we could get Pops out to hunt, she wanted him to have the chance. She was so excited when she found out her grandfather had gotten those two bucks. She thought that was so cool,‚Äù continued Pratt.
 Pratt and her dad were in the blind together that Saturday evening.
 ‚ÄúI saw a four-point working through,‚Äù she began. ‚ÄúBut, out the oher window of the hut, I saw another buck rubbing on a tree about 80 yards out. Dad did not see it. It was looking out the other window in the hut. I held up on hand to stop him from shooting.
 ‚ÄúThe larger one began working his way toward us,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúThe four- point moved on and along came the 10-point. After my dad shot, he didn‚Äôt move a muscle. He was so composed. I turned and looked at him and said congratulations you just shot a nice buck.‚Äù
 Less than an hour later, he got the eight-pointer.
 ‚ÄúDad cocked his bow again. We had lots of light left. He had the potential to see another nice buck come along so we decided to stay. Forty more minutes we looked out the window and saw the eight-point rubbing on a tree. It was probably 50 yards away when dad shot,‚Äù said Pratt. ‚ÄúThose two bucks died within 10 yards from one another.‚Äù
 That's something for show and Tell, isn't it?
