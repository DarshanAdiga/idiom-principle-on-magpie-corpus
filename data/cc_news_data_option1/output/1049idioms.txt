This makes you much easier to market to, because you can be marketed to as part of your group. It also makes it easier for you to know where you belong, how you should act, and what views you should hold. Simply ask another member of your group, and they can inform you as to what the group thinks. That way you don’t have to think it through for yourself.
 Identifiers aren’t so much about who you are, but what identity you subscribe to. Pronouns are a marker to identify a person to a given group, and for the group to be identified as a collection of same identifying individuals. Individuals within a group must comply with the group’s thinking.
 When you hear things like “why does x group vote against their interests?” What you are hearing is that those persons have been identified as belonging to an identity group, and they ought to subscribe to it. Or when trans persons refuse to subscribe to trans ideology, choosing to think things through a different way, and are badgered.

 Free speech is under threat, and the calls for censorship are coming from journalists. In the past few weeks, op-eds have been published in _The Washington Post_ and _The Walrus_, as well as many other outlets, demanding that action be taken by legislators and corporations to restrain and control speech online. The writers of these op-eds are certain that the problems of violence and intolerance in our society can be solved by quieting those who espouse views that are anathema to a tolerant, equitable society. But there is something else at play here. They are not merely concerned for the public at large, but for the viability of their own outlets.
 These op-eds that oppose free speech are chock full of good intentions—enough to pave a superhighway to hell. Indeed, it almost seems that the people running these establishment outlets want this more than anything. They pour out ink and pixels to evidence compassion for those who might feel hurt by words, fear that violent speech is a slippery slope to violent action, or that the population lacks enough discernment to parse speech for themselves, but none of these is a good reason for placing limits on our fundamental liberty.
 From governments to establishment media outlets to corporations, the push for censorship is on. The op-ed in the _Washington Post_ called for the U.S. to draft hate speech laws that would modify the First Amendment’s provision for free speech. While Canada has hate speech laws enshrined in its Charter of Rights and Freedoms, _The Walrus’_ essay demands that those restrictions tighten. Media outlets and authors demanding more censorship, not less, foolishly deny that free speech is essential for journalistic integrity.

The current case contends that while Bill 21 cannot be stopped on the basis of its subversion of religious freedoms, the province’s overreach into criminal law, the vague definitions of religious symbols, and the violation of minority rights which, in the past, has been viewed as a separate constitutional principles,.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is calling on people to stop hoarding groceries and other supplies as one of the nation's most senior public health officials urged Americans to act with more urgency to protect themselves and others against the coronavirus. Dr. Anthony Fauci said he would like to see aggressive measures such as a 14-day national shutdown. “You don't have to buy so much,\" Trump said at a news conference. \"Take it easy. Just relax.” Trump assured Americans, after speaking with leading grocery chain executives, that grocers would remain open and that the supply chain remained healthy. Speaking at the same White House news conference, Vice President Mike Pence urged Americans to buy only the groceries they need for the week ahead. The comments from the president came Sunday after the government’s top infectious disease expert said he would like to see Americans to hunker down even more to help slow the spread of the coronavirus. Still, Fauci said travel restrictions within the United States, such as to and from hard-hit Washington state and California, probably would not be needed anytime soon. Officials in Washington were preparing for what was expected to be a long-haul effort to try to stem the virus that has upended life around the globe. “The worst is yet ahead for us,” Fauci said. “It is how we respond to that challenge that is going to determine what the ultimate endpoint is going to be.” Trump, on the other hand, offered an optimistic outlook even as officials said the infection rate in the U.S. was surging. The president acknowledged that the virus was “very contagious” but asserted that his administration had “tremendous control” over the spread of the disease. Trump said expressed pleasure that the Federal...

“On Thursday, I was called into the headmaster’s office to discuss my document and was told that I had undermined my position by writing a serious report, only to follow it up by taking ridiculous items to school,” he said, according to the paper. “I was told that I had a choice to make, either to have a serious discussion about the issue or to continue my rebellious streak and force the head to take me out of circulation.”
 Jacob Ford’s mother felt the issue was a simple expression of free speech and thus supports his humorous attempt to prove his point. “I think Jacob’s protest has been very peaceful and I believe he should have his say,” she said, according to _Metro UK_. “At the end of the day, I believe in freedom of speech and so I’m very proud of him for standing up for something he believes in.

When she was sentenced, Superior Court Justice Bruce Thomas said, “She was far from an angel of mercy. Instead, she was a shadow of death that passed over [her victims].”
 However, while Wettlaufer is behind bars, her case signifies what many are calling “systemic vulnerabilities” within the Canadian healthcare industry, which has allowed for misuse of prescription drugs, medication, and the potential abuse for victims.
 As it stands, many believe that had Wettlaufer not begun to feel the weight of guilt and confessed it is unlikely that she would have ever been caught and would have been free to continue killing her elderly patients. This also means that, if oversights in the healthcare industry are not addressed, there’s little stopping someone like Wettlaufer from committing similar crimes in the future.

 Moreover, the special privileges Canada provides Quebec, which this year came in the form of a Supreme Court justice pick, are exceptional and, as Soroski sees it, gives the federal government greater reason to expect the province to fall in line with the Canadian consensus.

The Minnesota Department of Corrections recently announced it will suspend in- person visiting for at least two weeks, and the ban will likely be most felt at the Shakopee women’s correctional facility, where a high percentage of its visitors are children visiting their mothers.
 According to the DOC website, the facility will explore ways to expand electronic visiting, including potential reduction or waiver of fees. But electronic visitations are nothing compared to the precious four hours the mothers at the Shakopee correctional facility get once every-other Saturday to hug, visit and play with their children.
 Despite not being able to visit with children and loved ones, however, the general sentiment within the facility was disappointment, yet understanding.
 Rosalyn Richards, an inmate from Minneapolis who has children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren who come to visit her, said this is an emotional time for many of the women, who look forward to seeing their loved-ones in person.
 “Emotionally, this has an impact,” Richards said. “But this is to the good, working for both sides, so each party is not at risk. I think it’s fair.”
 Richards added most of the women feeling the brunt of the visitor ban are those with babies.
 “You just can’t go emotional. You can’t go the whole picture,” Richards said. “You look at the flip side, of putting (loved ones) at risk, and it makes sense.”
 Elizabeth Hawes, an inmate in Shakopee who is not a mother herself but volunteers in the parenting unit and advocates for other women who do have children, said many of her fellow inmates struggle to talk over the phone with children who are nine years of age or older.
 “That 9-year-old and beyond, when you’d like that time with your mom to talk about things personally, you don’t want to talk about that over the phone,” Hawes said, adding it will be difficult for those women, specifically, to connect with their pre-teens and teenagers over the phone or through a video call.
 Another blow the inmates will take due to the temporary no-visitor rule, Hawes said, was an event the correctional facility puts on each year, when the facility’s librarian puts together several different stations, each with its own learning activity and volunteer. That event has been canceled for the time being, since volunteers won’t be able to come into the facility.
 “But I also think there’s a lot of people here with compromised immune systems, so everyone does understand why this is happening,” Hawes said.

The world's second- and third-ranked players joined the top-ranked player in rejecting the Premier Golf League, landing two more heavy blows to the proposed league's hopes.
 No. 2 Jon Rahm of Spain told Golfweek in a story published Sunday that he's focused on the PGA Tour, while No. 3 Brooks Koepka told the Associated Press on Sunday that he's "out of the PGL."
 Last month, world No. 1 Rory McIlroy of Northern Ireland said he was opposed to the PGL, which would feature 48 of the world's top players with larger purses but also require appearances at all 18 events each year.
 "At the end of the day, I'm a competitor," Rahm said, per Golfweek. "I'm a PGA Tour member, and I'm going to stay that way."
 Koepka, who was ranked No. 1 at the start of February, told the AP he couldn't support the PGL because it would undermine less proven players who work their way up from other circuit tours.
 "I'm going with the PGA Tour," Koepka said. "I have a hard time believing golf should be about just 48 players.
 .".. I get that the stars are what people come to see. But these guys who we see win, who have been grinding for 10 or 15 years, that's what makes the cool stories. I'd have a hard time looking at guys and putting them out of a job."
 Koepka himself had to work his way up from anonymity, going from the Challenge Tour in 2012 and 2013 to the European Tour before his first PGA Tour victory in 2015. A year and a half later, he won the U.S. Open, his first of four major titles in less than two calendar years.
 "I don't forget where I've come from," Koepka told the AP. "There are guys from that top 125 who could be the next star."
 McIlroy was the first to publicly reject the idea of the PGL, while other prominent players like Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson have taken a wait-and- see approach. McIlroy said he was opposed to the requirement of playing all 18 events -- though they wouldn't conflict with the four traditional majors -- saying he values his flexibility.
 He expanded on his thoughts in March, adding, "I didn't really like where the money was coming from, either."
 The PGL is partially funded by the Saudi Arabian government, according to CEO Andrew Gardiner. McIlroy previously turned down playing at the European Tour's Saudi International, citing "a morality" as part of his decision.

 Despite the 1999 Supreme Court ruling that granted equal voting rights to both on and off-reserve band members, the issue of who can vote and run for office on a reserve continues to create strife amongst First Nation communities.
 In the Alberta Treaty Eight territory region Swan River, this issue has recently come to a head with a dispute between the local Chief, Council and Shauna Jean, an off-reserve member who wants to run for the position of Chief.
 She and her brother, Rob Houle, who was nominated to run for councillor but also lives off-reserve, both had their applications denied by the electoral officer because of some existing codes in the local band electoral code that seem to prohibit their candidacy because of their living location, despite the Supreme Court’s ruling.

Biden and his allies focus on the later years of the Obama administration.
 U.S. Rep. Ruben Gallego, who represents largely Latino areas of Phoenix and endorsed Biden this month, predicted that Latino voters will come around. But he said Biden could help himself by talking up his own progressive proposals, such as a $15 minimum wage and a public option for health insurance. He should also talk about the Obama health care law that extended coverage to millions of Americans, including a disproportionate number of Latinos, Gallego said.
 While Arizona Latinos are frustrated with the Obama-era deportations, Gallego said, they also remember that the administration sued to block the state’s anti-illegal immigration bill known as SB1070, sued Sheriff Joe Arpaio for racial profiling and enacted DACA.
 “Even those voters who aren’t supporting Vice President Biden right now, I think they still have positive feelings toward him and at the end of the day will be very supportive in the general,” Gallego said.
 Biden’s defenders also point to Sanders’ work to help kill a 2007 immigration bill, which Sanders warned would drive down wages.
 “No one’s perfect, but let’s not forget that he made a fatal mistake by doing that,” Gallego said.
 Latinos in the West, where Sanders has done so well, are mainly of Mexican and Central American descent. It’s a different story in Florida, where Cubans and Puerto Ricans predominate, making the state a potential bright spot for Biden. Sanders’ self-identity as a democratic socialist and his recent defense of certain aspects of Cuban dictator Fidel Castro’s regime are a liability with Cuban voters.
 “Miami is a melting pot for people from all over,” said José Javier Rodríguez, a Democratic state senator from Miami who was an early Biden supporter. “Biden’s appeal hits a cross-section in ways that Sen. Sanders does not.”

Against this backdrop, semiconductor manufacturers are investing in developing their offerings for 5G-capable infrastructure. Manufacturing of 5G chips is expected to create potential opportunities for manufacturers of RF filter in the coming years, in turn pushing the growth of the RF filter market.

Olsen says that with evacuations now underway at other posts and travel becoming more challenging by the day, the agency decided to expand the suspension and evacuations.
 “As COVID-19 continues to spread and international travel becomes more and more challenging by the day, we are acting now to safeguard your well-being and prevent a situation where Volunteers are unable to leave their host countries,” Olsen says.

Pence said that he and the president would brief the nation’s governors on Monday “specifically about our expanding testing to the American people.”
 Chad Wolf, the acting secretary of Homeland Security, acknowledged that many travelers were facing “unacceptable” long lines as they waited to be screened at U.S. airports this weekend. He said average wait time for screening was down to 30 minutes at most airports, but the problem had not been fixed for those arriving at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport.
 Pence said the federal government on Monday will release updated guidance concerning restaurants, bars and other establishments. California and Illinois are among jurisdictions that have ordered restaurants and bars to close to help slow the spread of the virus.
 Asked whether restaurants and bars around the nation should close for the time being, Fauci said he wanted to wait for the guidance to come but allowed, “That could be.”

This lack of need and potential for danger is perhaps why Senators attempted to strip the bill of its most controversial aspects before it became law. Despite this, the Trudeau government, with the help of “independent” Senators, pushed through the bill without accepting any substantive changes.
 While this is all jaw-dropping, the decision to move forward with this kind of law in the face of steep opposition is even more shocking. It quickly becomes comedic when you also consider the ease and frequency with which the Liberals will brandish their pro-minority and pro-science reflexes.
 At some point the government will have to decide if they actually plan to govern based on science, reason, and data, or if they instead wish to continue wasting precious political capital on PR-short stops which in the long term erode our civil liberties.

However, because of the nature of the threat the Quebec government has projected onto its society, some maintain that Bill 21 still warrants a strong-handed response from the federal government, no matter the legal and political risks that might be faced down the road.

 “If a government is going to erase a group of citizens from public participation, I am very passionate and tense about it, and I think that government and its supporters should be exposed to all possible public critique,” countered Soroski whose op-ed in the Calgary Herald was titled “Bill 21 and the moral emptiness of Justin Trudeau.”

Dr. Harry is one of the leading pioneers in a radical new form of treatment delivery service aimed at reducing the need for new brick and mortar structures.


  He explained, “I left formal treatment centers because I saw some of the problems. We disrupt people horribly when we take them out of their homes. We are getting sucked into the idea that treatment centers are the only way to beat addiction.


  "There is a model that is gaining traction across the country. It’s called Recovery Without Walls, which takes treatment to the patient. It’s directly geared to the individual and no two treatment programs are the same. It’s founded on evidence-based medicine, it’s more accessible, less expensive, and a better fit for older adults.”


  He continued, “They stay at a center for about 30 days of detox, then they’re placed back home in a safe environment. They’re set up with Skype or Zoom for daily therapy sessions and monitoring. Medications are delivered to their house and a nurse conducts weekly home visits. They return periodically, and they check in with their chosen counselor seven days a week for two consecutive years.”


  Addiction experts all agree that the lack of both mixed age and age specific rehabs is a national health care crisis that’s about to explode. They further concur that we need to elevate the visibility of this issue and make it part of a prominent ongoing conversation among people of all ages via television, print, internet, and radio broadcast media.


  The medical, pharmaceutical, and retirement industry also need to come on board. Furthermore, city, state and national policymakers need to begin drafting and enacting appropriate legislations.

The kind of language Mallick uses to bemoan Trump and is similar to Trump’s approach to his political rivals. Using methods you condemn when employed by your opposition in order to uphold your own position is completely nonsensical, especially in this case because Trump is, essentially, his tactics.


  Why would she caution young women and call them out as particularly vulnerable? Does she think they are not capable of considering all the factors, candidate positions, and making a decision based on those ideas and policy positions?


  The goal is to keep young women cowering in fear about a future over which they have no control. It tells them that they should harbour doubt about their own ability to make choices. This is the kind of language we have been seeing at the forefront of so much of the social justice movement, and this style of discourse is one we’ve learned from the much-maligned Trump.

First, it was a hoax. Then, it was fake news. Then it became a Democratic conspiracy and finally, when the handwriting was already on the wall, our illustrious leader conceded that yes, the virus existed but it would be "gone by April when the weather warms up."
 Not really caring about science, Trump went so far as to clamp down on media access to federal scientists at the U.S. Geological Survey, so said the LA Times https://tinyurl.com/y9ksorv8. On Wednesday, Trump said "(The virus) is going away, we want it to go away with very few deaths."
 We would like that also. But we have been nothing but confused because of his purposeful inaction. Increasing numbers in active cases and deaths wouldn't reflect kindly upon his administration so telling everyone the virus was under control would keep the hounds at bay.
 Trump claimed he had no idea the coronavirus was coming even though the CDC had been warning about it for months. And had his official in charge of pandemic preparedness and response efforts not been pushed out in May of '18, there was nothing or no one to take on the role of this magnitude. Trump had absolutely no idea what to do except to mess with the facts.
 We were told there were millions of testing kits available and that ANYONE could get a test who needed one. Not true. We were told that a vaccine would be ready in a few months. Not even possible. When the World Health Organization predicted a mortality rate of 3.4%, Trump said he had "a hunch" they were giving a false number. A hunch. Nothing science based, just a hunch. In fact, he said the number of Americans affected was going down. Not even.
 It is a sad day of affairs when our president is more concerned about how the numbers (not only of coronavirus but also the Dow) affect him and his presidency than he is about the effects of this pandemic. Stephen Morrison, director of Global Health Policy Center at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said, "Pandemics don't really care what numbers people use. They just march on and… people are getting extremely alarmed at the lack of preparedness for what lies ahead."
 No, it isn't a hoax, fake news or a Democratic conspiracy. It is very real, and unless we come to terms with this reality, we may wind up one of those numbers.

TOKYO (AP) — Millions of people began holing up at home, stocking up on supplies and keeping a wary eye on how close they got to friends and neighbors as fear of the coronavirus spread to more places around the world Monday. Resorts closed on the Las Vegas strip. Restaurants offered only take- out, if they were open at all. Schools, concerts, sporting events — even small-scale St. Patrick's Day parties — were canceled. It's a reality Northeast Asia has been living with for months, but while the focus of the pandemic appears to be shifting away from its original epicenter, many in Asia continue to urge vigilance against anything that might hurt hard-won gains. “If we loosen our grip on the quarantine, it could be a matter of time for the embers of small-scale cluster infections to be revived,” the South Korean mass-circulation Dong-a Ilbo newspaper said in an editorial Monday. China, where the virus was first detected in December, now accounts for less than half of the world's 169,000 cases, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. A shutdown of public gatherings and a quarantine of the hardest- hit central region has steadied China's caseload as the virus spreads rapidly elsewhere. Most of the world's 77,000 recovered patients are in China. Formerly ubiquitous traffic began returning to Beijing. Office buildings, however, enforced strict screenings for fever, and most restaurants only offered take-out. Children usually snowed under with classes and homework found themselves glued to screens, shopping, chatting and watching video clips. As the world inched toward a shutdown of much of public life — bars, restaurants, school, work — Asian cities have become increasingly worried about importing cases of the virus from abroad after making inroads...

  TorStar, the company that owns the _Toronto Star_ , has seen its stock plummet to historic lows. This came after the company reported an unexpected loss of $40.9 million. This financial hit is so extreme that the company may have to shift the balance of power amongst the company’s shareholders, according to BNN Bloomberg.


  The company’s publicly traded shares dropped to 53 cents, the lowest ever for TorStar. By midday, the shares had recovered to 60 cents, largely due to TorStar’s damage limitation tactics, including telling shareholders the company will weather the storm.


  TorStar’s Chief Executive John Boynton has told analysts that the newspaper is looking to diversify their income so to mitigate the decline of print sales. Although TorStar continues to report losses, Boynton is said to be content with their subscriber revenue, stating that it now represents a large portion of their revenue base.

 If we should fear fear, what should we say about panic? I have never in my nearly eight decades on this planet seen so much panic over relatively little danger. COVID-19 can be deadly, especially if you are old and ill. But it poses minimal risk to everyone else. In the grand total of deaths by other variations of the same virus, this is quite minor. Tens of thousands of Americans die from plain old ordinary strains of flu each year during the cold months. This sad toll includes hundreds of children.
 So how do we handle a disease which infects tens of millions and kills tens of thousands every year? Basically, we ignore it. Do we get our flu shots? No. Only a minority do -- and I am as guilty as the rest. I haven't had a flu shot in years. It's taken as background noise, and life goes on undisturbed. Does the NBA shut down because one of its players gets the flu? I don't think that's ever happened. Do schools shut down because one of the children, or Mrs. Jones who teaches the fifth grade, gets the flu? Not to my knowledge.
 This panic impacts me personally, where ordinary flu has not. Bonnie and I were set to travel to Europe on the 18th for five weeks. Once President Trump indicated getting back from Europe would be difficult, to say the least, our long-anticipated journey was out the window. If I thought such bans were likely to save lives, then I wouldn't mind the sacrifice so much, but I doubt steps like this will have much impact. Once the horse is stolen, it is too late to lock the barn.
 Travel is trivial, but what about the people who will lose their livelihood as businesses of all kinds either shut down or slow greatly? The money we would have spent would have been their income. Millions of workers depend on travel, entertainment, transportation and hospitality. Will their enforced sacrifices save many lives? I don't think so.
 Consider the market reaction to all of this. I cannot know what will be happening when you read this, but as I am writing this the Dow is down another 2,000 points to 21,000 and change. A few weeks ago it was nearly to 30,000. All of a sudden your retirement plans have taken a 25 to 30% haircut and maybe worse. This has been one of the swiftest and most severe losses in market history -- impacting hundreds of millions worldwide. Life has changed in the twinkling of an eye and it is an open question when it will return to normal. I hope quickly, but I have my doubts.
 So what is different about COVID-19 that we would close schools for a disease apparently posing almost no risk to a child, and continue to operate schools when a known child killer is around? Why are we stampeding over the cliff for a disease which in the U.S., except for wildly exaggerated fears, will kill a few hundred, maybe, and ignore what certainly kills tens of thousands?
 The best analogy I can think of is termites eating away at a beam. All is just fine, until one fine day the last bite causes catastrophic collapse. The termites of safety and security have been eating away at the supports of our society for as long as I can remember. Safety and security feed on fear, as certainly as those termites feed on wood. I don't have the space to elaborate on the many examples, but just think what a playground was like in 1955. Or other ways we bubble-wrap our children. How likely do you think a bubble- wrapped child is likely to grow into a brave adult?
 Once fear is ingrained and a new threat emerges, panic ensues. I cannot know how deadly COVID-19 will turn out to be, but I can guarantee the panic will cause more damage than the cause.

COHOCTON -- Two wind projects in Steuben County are set to take off as Governor Andrew Cuomo on Friday unveiled the details of the awards for 21 large-scale solar, wind, and energy storage projects across upstate New York, totaling 1,278 megawatts of new renewable capacity.
   
 Three projects were announced in the Southern Tier.
   
 Under the Cohocton Wind Project, TerraForm Power will repower an existing wind farm, leading to an increase in new renewable capacity of 35.8 megawatts in the Town of Cohocton.
   
 Under the Prattsburgh Wind Farm project, Terra-Gen will build a 145 megawatt wind farm in the towns of Avoca, Cohocton, Prattsburgh, and Wheeler.
   
 Under the SunEast Valley Solar project, SunEast Development will build a 19.99 megawatt solar facility in the town of Owego.
   
 In the Finger Lakes, the Highview Solar Project under SunEast Development will build a 20 megawatt solar facility in the Town of Castile.
   
 Overall, the state said the projects announced Friday will spur over $2.5 billion in direct, private investments toward their development, construction and operation and create over 2,000 short-term and long-term jobs. The awards accelerate New York's progress towards Governor Cuomo's Green New Deal goal to obtain 70 percent of the state's electricity from renewable sources by 2030, as codified by the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, and supports the State mandate for a 100 percent carbon-free electricity sector by 2040.
   
 "New York continues to be a leader in developing large-scale renewable energy projects in a way that brings significant economic benefits and jobs to the state," Governor Cuomo said. "With these projects we will build on our aggressive strategy to combat climate change and lay a foundation for a more sustainable future for all New Yorkers."
   
 Several of the projects awarded are expected to break ground as soon as late 2020 and all projects are expected to be operational by 2024. NYSERDA payments under these awards will not commence until projects have obtained all required permits and local approvals, and begin commercial operation. As part of NYSERDA's solicitation, proposers underwent a rigorous review process to ensure that they have, and will continue to engage in effective community outreach, as well as adopt responsible siting practices throughout the development process. Through this third procurement and subsequent procurements, NYSERDA will continue to work with developers, other State agencies, and stakeholders to ensure that the State can achieve its clean energy goals while protecting lands of agricultural importance as well as those that support critical environmental resources and habitats.
   
 As the State continues its progress towards the 2030 renewable energy target, it will also continue to emphasize and enhance engagement with the communities where projects are being developed. In order to directly assist communities, NYSERDA will also continue to offer resources and no-cost technical assistance to all cities, towns, and villages throughout the state.

The first 5,000 gallons, manufactured this week using a formula McAllister said meets or exceeds U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and World Health Organization standards, sold out immediately and have been distributed at two pickup sites — one in Pearland and one at Chopin Mon Ami Catering, 4417 Ave. S in Galveston.


  Todd Schott, the Galveston distributor, has received orders from the San Luis Hotel and other large businesses where supplies are dwindling, he said.


  McAllister invested “tens of thousands” of dollars in raw products to make the hand sanitizer to ensure he could produce thousands of gallons at once, he said.


  The raw ingredients — isopropyl alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, glycerin and a cellulose product with a small amount of Blue No. 1 dye — already are dwindling because of worldwide demand, and McAllister will invest more as long as orders come in, he said.


  The hand sanitizer comes in gallon containers with a hand pump, in part because smaller containers are hard to find right now, McAllister said. At $45 a gallon, his product price per ounce falls in line with Purell, he said.


  “I’m covering my costs, but I’m not in it to strike it rich,” he said. “I have a 4-and-a-half-year-old, and something tells me things are going to be different after all this. We’re doing our part as a small business.”

MANKATO, Minn. (AP) — Jon Burris doesn’t like to call the developmentally disabled folks he works with “clients.” “I call them individuals. I don’t want to take away their identity.” Burris has an easy, engaging manner as he talks with Nancy Hollerich, a 60-year-old resident at a Harry Meyering Center intermediate-care facility on Hoffman Road in Mankato. His fondness for her is evident, even when she gives a blunt review when someone asks her if she likes the food served there. “Not really,” she says, as Burris breaks into laughter. “You like going out to eat don’t you Nancy?” “I like going out to lunch,” she answers. Burris is a coordinator at the facility who schedules staff, fills out paperwork and, like all coordinators, also puts in shifts of direct care to residents each week. The menu aside, Hollerich loves her home. “The staff is all kind to me. They go outside and go out to lunch with me. We go on field trips. We just went to “Mamma Mia!” (at Chanhassen Dinner Theatres),” Hollerich told the Mankato Free Press. “We go to movies and fairs.” Like most everyone, she’s getting cabin fever. “I have my own garden.

The heads of the Kern County Superintendent of Schools and Kern County Public Health Services Department are telling public schools to temporarily close to aid in the fight against coronavirus.
 A joint letter from superintendent Mary C. Barlow and public health director Matthew Constantine was issued minutes before 8 p.m. Sunday.
 "It is a mandate to close," KCSOS spokesman Rob Meszaros told The Californian.
 Although there have been no confirmed cases in Kern County, all Kern County K-12 schools, preschools and charter schools are to close temporarily, no later than the close of school on Wednesday, March 18. Schools should not reopen earlier than Tuesday, April 14.
 "Out of an abundance of caution, to minimize the spread of COVID-19 throughout Kern County, we are recommending a temporary closure of all Kern County public schools. This recommendation also applies to preschools and charter schools in Kern County," the statement attributed to Barlow and Constantine said.
 Parents were urged to take steps to reduce children's risk to exposure by avoiding taking them to crowded areas. They should also avoid all non- essential travel, Constantine said.
 The two officials said they "applaud" the efforts of school districts that have made provisions to comply with Gov. Gavin Newsom's order to continue offering essential services, which they listed as:
 • high-quality educational opportunities that address equity and access issues of students in disadvantaged communities.
 • a free and appropriate education to students with disabilities.
 • school meals in "noncongregate settings" that protect students and staff.
 • supervision for students during ordinary school hours.
 Earlier Sunday afternoon, during a livestreamed news conference in which he announced wide-ranging guidance and directives related to coronavirus concerns, Newsom said the Kern High School District was the only school district of the largest 25 in the state that had not closed.
 At that hour, Newsom said 24 of 25 of the largest school districts in the state had closed.
 He said 51 percent of the districts in the state have closed, but they represented 80 percent to 85 percent of the children who won't be going to school.
 The governor said by Tuesday his administration will have very specific guidance on how schools can handle the provision of free and reduced price breakfasts and lunches in light of campus closures.
 Some 73 percent of students in Kern County receive free and reduced price meals and extra-support resources, The Californian reported Friday.
 The situation was rapidly evolving as The Californian neared its print deadline Sunday night.
 Earlier Sunday, public school districts and private schools had issued various plans, which can be found at Bakersfield.com.
 However, it was not immediately clear after the late Sunday announcement from the county superintendent and public health how quickly individual districts were going to move, and if some of the plans announced earlier would change.

 According to _CTV News_ , construction for the expansion is expected to be complete by the middle of 2022. The Liberal government has forecasted taking up to $125 million in revenue from Trans Mountain Canada each year up to the expansion’s completion and the $500 million each year after.

This theory “posits that people are always striving to create a world in which their idea of themselves make sense. We are motivated, sometimes above any sense of morality or personal gain, simply to hold our view of ourselves constant. This allows us to maintain a coherent sense of order, even if it means doing things the rest of the world would see as counterproductive.” This idea was explored in _The Atlantic_ as a means of trying to figure out why Trump voters are so hung up on being Trump voters. The logic of this theory of why a person would so adamantly advocate for the prevalence of their group identity makes perfect sense when applied to pronoun dictation.
 Your name is not as personal as your pronoun, and while your name may be given, your pronouns are specifically requested. When you offer your pronoun it is a solemn statement, a demand that you be referred to with this specific language and no other. It is a way for you to state so much more than who you are, but where you belong. And in today’s political climate, when ideologies come in sets, and holding one political belief is often taken as a signal as to which adjacent political beliefs you hold, pronouns are a way of stating your group, your ideological set of beliefs, and your lack of individuality.
 Media, big tech, basically all corporations, have gotten fully on board with this group identification. Why might this be? Even once-serious civil liberties organizations want you to identify as less of yourself and more of a generic group of hes, shes, xes, xirs, or thems.

 Right now it seems like Calgary may be getting a new arena based on Monday’s tentative agreements that have finally been reached between the city and Calgary Sports and Entertainment. I’m not exactly thrilled though. It’s as if the new arena and the budget cuts live in two different universes.
 At least for some people, the deal exists in a much better reality. In Kristien Anderson’s article on the topic, she refers to it as a “no-brainer for sports fans” later going on to put me in stitches saying “it is a good deal for the taxpayer” as if losing money to vanity projects was a benefit.
 The issue here is that simply liking the idea of a new arena doesn’t actually make the project have any more merit. Kristien gets lost at some point in the article saying “Make it exciting. Make it modern, unique, but filled with tradition. Make it about Lanny McDonald’s moustache. Theoren Fleury scoring against the Oilers”; as if this nostalgia trip is somehow proof we have $275 million to throw at this project over a three year building period (2021-2024).

Gold in search of fresh direction after $50 move post-Fed rate cut. Stalled USD rebound and Treasury yields slump continue to underpin. Broad market sell-off amid coronavirus to keep the upside in check. Having witnessed a volatile early Asian session, gold(futures on Comex) is stabilizing near the mid-1550s, as investors await fresh catalysts for the next direction in the prices. The yellow-metal opened with a $45 bullish opening gap this Monday, as traders sold-off the greenback across its main competitors, responding to the surprise rate cut delivered by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) late Sunday. The dollar sank in tandem with the US Treasury yields, as the demand for the US bonds rose, with markets unwilling to buy into the Fed rate cut decision that is said to cushion the blow of the coronavirus impact on the economy. Gold, however, failed to sustain at higher levels and fell as low as $1524 to close the gap, as investors locked-in gain after the upsurge. The buyers re-emerged around the latter, prompting a recovery in the commodity towards $1550, as the broad US dollar rebound stalled. Markets now remain in a wait and see mode ahead of the G7 and EU Finance Ministers' economic response to the virus outbreak, which will have a significant impacton the risk sentiment and the dollar trades, eventually influencing gold prices.

Little did Purdue know on March 7 as it left Keady Court following a loss that in many ways reflected its whole season — an overtime defeat vs. Rutgers — that that was it, that the season was over.
 Such was the case, though, for the Boilermakers and most everyone else in the college basketball world, as the COVID-19 outbreak cut short not just the NCAA hoops season but stopped sports at all levels — and, in a lot of ways, life in general — in its tracks.
 The Boilermakers finished up 16-15, perfectly reflective of the sort of season it was, the results varying widely from game to game, week to week, venue to venue.
 It was a season defined by inconsistency, sharp turns coming for better and worse when they might have been least expected.
 After Purdue lost to Rutgers, a critical, critical game toward the Boilermakers' at-large NCAA Tournament hopes, played in a Mackey Arena, and played within a free throw of a different outcome, that was probably the bottom, a golden opportunity having come and gone.
 Rewind a few weeks.
 It was Feb. 8 that Purdue may have peaked, walking off the floor at Assembly Hall a 74-62 winner at Indiana, marring Bob Knight Day — as we'll call it — on its rival's campus and landing the sort of road victory the Boilermakers hadn't previously appeared capable of.
 It was Purdue's third win in a row. The Boilermakers looked like they were well on their way to locking down their place in the NCAA Tournament. Of the final seven games, four would be played in Mackey Arena.
 Purdue went on to lose three of those home games, draining a big-time win at ranked Iowa of its value by dropping that Rutgers game, at home, next time out.
 That was the season in a nutshell, but Purdue concluded that season with great unknown. While it seemed to believe that its only path to the NCAA Tournament was to win the Big Ten Tournament, it can't be certain. Perhaps three wins in Indy would have done the trick, maybe even two.
 Purdue could have been a fascinating case study in this new era of NCAA Tournament selection.
 The Boilermakers, again, were just a game over .500 _overall_ but closed the season 32nd in the NET rankings, with the Big Ten's gravitational pull at its side. Had the Boilermakers beaten Rutgers and finished 10-10 in the league, then won one game in Indy, that very likely would have put them in the Tournament.
  _That_ was the difference between the NCAA Tournament and a presumed NIT bid, and the best face to put on this season, one in which Purdue proved it was capable of so much more — from dominant, _dominant_ wins over good teams at home, to a few highly competitive near-misses against good teams in non- conference, to two really high-level Big Ten road wins — but never could find the consistency to bridge the gap between this team's potential and its identity.
 Purdue still might have gone to the NCAA Tournament.
 We'll never know.
 There will be no NCAA Tournament. There was no Big Ten Tournament, beyond a couple of Day 1 games that didn't matter, but sure put a scare in everyone. College basketball is currently the same as everything else: Suspended indefinitely.
 Purdue will remember this season forever for its unprecedented ending.
 And undoubtedly for what could have been, but wouldn't have been anyway, even if it was.
 Now, a look back.

Since he is far and away the front-runner for the nomination, Uncle Joe’s pledge (nicely timed to overshadow any mistakes he might make in this debate) is money. But Bernie Sanders did allow that he would “in all likelihood” follow suit, though he may have crushed any vestigial hopes of a Sanders-Klobuchar Great Northern Tier ticket by focusing his consideration on a “progressive woman.” You’d have to guess Sanders will be pushed into a more definitive promise very soon.

Yes and no. Eritrea's relationship with the idea of regional cooperation has been complex ever since the country gained its independence from Ethiopia in 1993 following a 30-year war. That same year, Eritrean President Isaias Afewerki stunned his African peers when, at a summit of the Organization of African Unity (now the African Union), he publicly repeated criticisms he had formulated as one of Africa's most formidable guerrilla commanders: the OAU had utterly failed by closing its eyes to the terror inflicted by Ethiopia's Soviet-backed military dictatorship (the Derg) and he accused his peers of clinging to power while failing to take any meaningful action to address poverty in Africa. From that starting point, Eritrea never invested significant resources in continent-wide diplomacy. When the African Union (AU) imposed sanctions on Eritrea in 2009 for supporting al-Shabab extremists in Somalia and seeking to overthrow the Somali government, Eritrea suspended its participation in the organization and denounced the AU as a lapdog of U.S. imperialism and a mechanism for the hegemonic aspirations of Ethiopia, its main rival. In addition, Eritrea has twice withdrawn from the East African regional bloc--the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD).

Fear and faith are two polar opposites. They are on public display these days.
 The public health threat from the coronavirus has exposed the dynamics of both fear and faith. Fear has inspired people to stockpile toilet paper, hand sanitizer, and food so that just in case they come down with the virus, they will have their basic needs met. Others have canceled travel and even local public appearances in order to stay free of anything communicable. Many others have simply had their emotions and blood pressure toyed with as public health officials paint worse-case scenarios of possible statistics on contracting the disease and dying from it.
 On the other end of the spectrum are those who are simply foolhardy. They will take no precautions at all. Even if they are not feeling well, they may venture into public places with the possibility of infecting others with either this virus or another one. They are careless.
 In the middle are those who exercise faith. They are neither driven by fear nor mindlessness. They study all the facts of the case, take reasonable precautions, but proceed in faith that one way or another they will not succumb to the disease. And, even if they do fall ill, they have trust that they will recover. Given all of the statistics involved, the numbers are on the side of these people of faith.
 Of course, even with faith there is no absolute guarantee that you will not become sick. Even for those sequestering themselves in their own homes through this season, life can never be risk-free. One of the lies that underlies many people’s mindset today is that if just the right steps are taken we can eliminate all risk and never face real challenge in life. We know from the school of hard knocks that this simply is not so.
 And so we all have the option of living in fear or in faith. Which is it going to be?
 I choose faith. That is not blind faith; it is informed faith. The Bible defines faith as “the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.” Based on the considered judgments and objective facts on the ground, we make our own decisions about many things in daily life — not with absolute knowledge but with our tentative, limited, and yet adequate base of knowledge.
 We enter into marriage in faith. We are not exactly sure what our spouse is going to look like, act like, or think like 25 years into the future, but we proceed trusting that we have a gauge of their personality.
 We enter into business contracts in faith. We engage contactors expecting that they will perform according to the agreement in print —not always guaranteed that it will happen — but still confident that they would not be in business if they were consistently unreliable.
 We enter into friendships with a certain level of trust, hoping that we will see mutual respect, the keeping of confidences, reliability in promises made — not knowing for sure that this will always be the case — but we pursue relationships even with these risks.
 And for those of us who have faith in God, it is affirmed by thousands of years of testimony by those who have found God trustworthy. Our own experience with God is fresh and unique, and yet we enter into a connection with the divine expecting that it will be the same positive and helpful experience that thousands of other people have attested to in the past.
 An attitude of faith in all situations of life is a liberation to those who are willing to live in this way. It opens mind and heart to unlimited possibilities, rather than the stark parameters of scientifically proven realities.
 In the current health climate, we can trust that the likelihood of illness is very low, the likelihood of death is even lower, and that even if illness occurs there will be friends, family and health professionals who will come to our aid. For people of faith, the overarching reassurance of the presence of God completes the picture and a life of confidence is possible. May God help us all to avoid fear and embrace faith for all of life.

GBP/USD bounces off five-month low as USD bears cheer Fed's surprise action. The US Federal Reserve announced rate cuts, QE. Global central banks unite to counter COVID-19. UK PM Johnson to hold a daily press conference on the outbreak. With the Fed's surprise action recalling the US dollar bears, GBP/USD bounces off five-month low to 1.2340, up 0.50%, while heading into the London open on Monday. The US Federal Reserve announced a surprise rate cut to 0.25%, in addition to $700 billion worth of Quantitative Easing (QE), during the early Asian session. Additionally, the global central bankers including the Fed, BOC, BOJ, ECB and SNB joined to lower pricing on standing US dollar liquidity swaps by 25 basis points. In doing so, central banks will offer US dollar swaps with an 84-day maturity, in addition to existing one-week operations. While the moves were largely praised by the BOE policymakers, the UK central bank is still considered to be lagging to counter the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. To ward off the allegations, the UK PM Boris Johnson will hold daily press conferences, as per the Independent. Over the counter, the global markets remain volatile as not only the Fed but the RBNZ also announced an unscheduled rate cut while the BOJ is in the pipeline. That said, the risk-tone remains on the back foot with the US treasury yields down nearly 30 basis points while markets in Asia also flash losses by the press time.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Peace Corps is telling its volunteers around the world that it is suspending all operations globally and evacuating all volunteers in light of the spread of the new coronavirus. In an open letter to volunteers posted Sunday on its website, the federal agency's director, Jody Olsen, says the decision follows recent evacuations in China and Mongolia due to the outbreak. Olsen says that with evacuations now underway at other posts and travel becoming more challenging by the day, the agency decided to expand the suspension and evacuations. “As COVID-19 continues to spread and international travel becomes more and more challenging by the day, we are acting now to safeguard your well-being and prevent a situation where Volunteers are unable to leave their host countries,” Olsen says. Olsen says the posts are not closing and that the agency looks forward to returning to normal operations when conditions permit. The letter says country directors would be providing more information to volunteers. The Peace Corps was established in 1961 during the Kennedy administration as a government-run volunteer program serving nations around the world. Its website says volunteers perform community work in more than 60 countries today and that more than 235,000 Americans have served in 141 countries since its inception.

 “This is a really historic cancellation for us here for the Catholic Church,” Aguirre said. “It’s pretty rare. Even in the midst of war sometimes we still get together but this virus is a silent agent that spreads so quickly we just don’t have a choice.”
 Statistics vary in terms of the virus’ toll.
 As of Sunday, the World Health Organization estimates there are 153,517 confirmed cases and 5,735 deaths from COVID-19. The Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University puts the figures at more than 162,600 cases and more than 6,000 deaths. Sixty-two have died in the U.S., 40 in Washington alone.
 On Sunday, the Yakima diocese announced one of its own pastors, Rev. Alejandro "Alex" Trejo, of Our Lady of the Desert Parish in Mattawa, tested positive for the virus.
 At St. Joseph, normal church functions have come to a halt. Funeral services will continue but with limited attendance. Weddings are more or less out of the question. All other gatherings are canceled.
 “We just don’t want to put ourselves in any compromising positions,” Aguirre said.
 Churches throughout the area have issued similar cancellations. Grace City Church hosted video services online Sunday. So did Sage Hills Church.
 St. Joseph is still figuring how it might be able to perform a similar service.
 Jason Eastman was one of a dozen people at confession Saturday afternoon, including his wife Kristin and their three children.
 “From somebody that comes to Mass regularly, it’s important to keep receiving the communion regularly,” Eastman said.
 He and other parishioners are working to find a way to gather, physically or virtually.
 Aguirre called this a time to be like history’s first Christians who met in their homes and prayed in small groups.
 “Now more than ever we need to concentrate on hope because we believe in the God of hope so this should not be the end. It will not be the end,” Aguirre said. He addedg, “Now is the time to pray and be the way the church was in the very beginning.”
 Aguirre and a collection of local pastors met Saturday at the home of Grace City pastor Josh McPherson, along with Wenatchee Mayor Frank Kuntz and Assistant Superintendent of the Wenatchee School District Mark Helm to discuss challenges present by the virus and its effects on the community.
 In speaking with his church members, Aguirre has heard worry and fear — common in times of uncertainty, he said. He believes he and his colleagues in faith can ease the tension.
 “Love can never be paralyzed and we have to remind the people that this is not the end, that God is with us and that God will help us go through all this and be victorious in the end,” Aguirre said.
 He’s optimistic the tide will turn.
 “We have been in worse times in the past, this is not the worst time for humanity,” Aguirre said. “But this will bring us together. It will bring us closer, I think. It will help us focus more on what we should be about as family and community in general.”
 Though his church won't bustle for the immediate future as it had recently, Aguirre and his staff will be of service, hosting private communion or anointing the sick.
 "We still have a lot to do," Aguirre said.

 There is something peculiar about the amount, or should I say, endless coverage of Greta Thunberg’s crusade to save the planet and the total disinterest the media has in similar stories of activists who propose actual solutions. While I can admire Greta’s tenacious spirit and devotion to what is certainly a noble cause. It seems as though the media’s divise nature these days and the general public’s proclivity for doom and gloom news stories has left other activists high and dry.
 What’s worse still is that it appears as though young environmental activists who are proposing tangible and viable solutions are overlooked. Who wants a solution to a catastrophic problem? Sure it’s good for the world and the preservation of the human race, but does it get clicks. If it bleeds it leads, isn’t that the old maxim of journalism?
 If you want to go viral nowadays in a positive sense, you better be a cat, or a K-Pop star with funny dance moves. Otherwise keep it grim, we might have been wrong about Y2K but this time it’s all over for real.

The American Red Cross is calling for healthy residents to donate blood as blood supplies have been tightening up in light of the coronavirus pandemic on top of the regular cold and flu season.


  Fewer people have been donating blood, and the situation has become even more worrisome as several blood drives have been canceled.


  "The American Red Cross is doing everything it can to prevent a blood shortage. Over the last few days, we have seen blood drive cancellations grow at a concerning rate," Kelly Isenor of the Red Cross told The Sun Chronicle.

First, it was a hoax. Then, it was fake news. Then it became a Democratic conspiracy and finally, when the handwriting was already on the wall, our illustrious leader conceded that yes, the virus existed but it would be "gone by April when the weather warms up."


  Not really caring about science, Trump went so far as to clamp down on media access to federal scientists at the U.S. Geological Survey, so said the LA Times https://tinyurl.com/y9ksorv8. On Wednesday, Trump said "(The virus) is going away, we want it to go away with very few deaths."


  We would like that also. But we have been nothing but confused because of his purposeful inaction. Increasing numbers in active cases and deaths wouldn't reflect kindly upon his administration so telling everyone the virus was under control would keep the hounds at bay.


  Trump claimed he had no idea the coronavirus was coming even though the CDC had been warning about it for months. And had his official in charge of pandemic preparedness and response efforts not been pushed out in May of '18, there was nothing or no one to take on the role of this magnitude. Trump had absolutely no idea what to do except to mess with the facts.


  We were told there were millions of testing kits available and that ANYONE could get a test who needed one. Not true. We were told that a vaccine would be ready in a few months. Not even possible. When the World Health Organization predicted a mortality rate of 3.4%, Trump said he had "a hunch" they were giving a false number. A hunch. Nothing science based, just a hunch. In fact, he said the number of Americans affected was going down. Not even.


  It is a sad day of affairs when our president is more concerned about how the numbers (not only of coronavirus but also the Dow) affect him and his presidency than he is about the effects of this pandemic. Stephen Morrison, director of Global Health Policy Center at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said, "Pandemics don't really care what numbers people use. They just march on and… people are getting extremely alarmed at the lack of preparedness for what lies ahead."


  No, it isn't a hoax, fake news or a Democratic conspiracy. It is very real, and unless we come to terms with this reality, we may wind up one of those numbers.

The ongoing coronavirus pandemic that has swept the globe into a wave of caution and drastic changes has hit home.
   
 Both the Iowa High School Athletic Association and the Illinois High School Association made changes to their boys state basketball tournaments, while Southeastern Community College canceled its southern trips for the baseball and softball teams and Iowa Wesleyan, in following with the NCAA guidelines, has ended spring sports until April 3, when the situation will be re- evaluated.
   
 In addition, the NJCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, which was set to begin Monday in Hutchinson, Kansas, has been pushed back with a tentative start date of April 20. That leaves Indian Hills head coach Hank Plona with at least 1 1/2 months between games for his student-athletes.
   
 "I'm glad they postponed it instead of canceling it. We are looking forward to the opportunity to play with everyone else next month," Plona said. "There are a lot of unknowns right now. We will workout and stay in shape the next two or three weeks, then start practicing again. It's almost like October again where you practice for two or three weeks before the first game of the season. But we don't want to do that four or five weeks out. We will take a couple weeks to gather ourselves and then practice for probably 30-40 minutes a day. We want our guys to stay fresh."
   
 The Iowa boys state basketball tournament carried on as normal until Friday, when the IHSAA limited spectators in Wells Fargo Arena in Des Moines for the consolation and championship finals.
   
 Only team members, game officials, essential tournament workers, Iowa Events Center staff, limited credentialed media and select school spectators were allowed inside the facility. Those spectators were asked to leave the facility once their game was complete.
   
 The Illinois High School Association, meanwhile, canceled its remaining winter state series postseason tournaments, which include boys basketball, scholastic bowl, drama and group interpretation, music, debate and journalism, over concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
   
 "We appreciate the patience and understanding that we have received from everyone involved in this process over the past 72 hours," said IHSA assistant executive director Craig Anderson. "We have stressed the fluidity of this situation and have been transparent about the possibility that a suspension or cancellation could occur. While we had support from the Illinois Department of Public Health and the Peoria City/County Health Department to continue our events with limited spectators, it has become untenable to continue the events among our member schools. Multiple schools who are participating or hosting these sports and activities have been forced to withdraw from those roles, clarifying the need for the IHSA to take definitive action. The board considered suspending the events, but after deliberate discussion, did not believe that was a realistic option within the timeline. We feel for everyone who has been impacted, but must put the health and safety of all involved ahead of these events."
   
 The IHSA has not made any decisions related to spring sport tournaments at this time.
   
 "It is too early to make any decisions regarding IHSA spring state final tournaments," said Anderson. "We respect the NCAA's decision to cancel its spring championships, but also recognize that the exposure and travel by our high school teams is not as expansive as collegiate teams. At this juncture, we recommend that all IHSA spring sport teams consult their local health departments, and follow their recommendations on if and how to proceed with practices and regular-season contests."
   
 SCC Athletics Director Tyler Gaston decided to cancel the southern trips for the baseball and softball teams as those student-athletes and coaches were getting prepared to leave.
   
 "As the athletic director at Southeastern Community College, it is most important to me to support our coaches as they work with our student-athletes to ensure they have the best experience during their time with us. This includes making everybody's health and safety a top priority," Gaston said. "The decision to cancel their trips was not made easily. It was done with our student-athletes' best interest in mind, as we continuously communicate with public officials and move to follow appropriate safety measures.
   
 "Coach (Melissa) Flores, Coach (Justin) Schulte, and I are disheartened that our softball and baseball players will miss these opportunities that they've worked incredibly hard to earn. We appreciate your understanding that circumstances beyond anyone's control led to this difficult decision.
   
 "Likewise, I understand that the cancellations have a wide-reaching impact. It is not lost on us that many family members had already made plans for family trips and may be financially impacted by this decision. Although I cannot offer financial remedies to this unfortunate situation, I offer my true sentiments to our Blackhawk players and families."
   
 The NJCAA Board of Regents will meet April 3 as previously scheduled and an update from the National Office will be provided with a full assessment of the national landscape. Should conditions improve, regions and individual colleges will be allowed to resume regular season competition in a format and time period following April 3 that has been approved by the region. During this entire "no competition" period, practice standards are determined by the individual colleges.
   
 Iowa Wesleyan University in Mount Pleasant allowed its spring sports teams to compete through today. All sports will be halted on Monday until at least April 3, when the situation will be re-evaluated.
   
 "Effective March 15, all spring sports programs are postponed until April 3. All practices and competition for all athletic programs will be halted until the University makes an announcement on the remainder of the semester. Housing, dining services, and essential campus functions will remain open. Any student-athlete who does not feel comfortable being on campus will be supported in their decision to remain home," Iowa Wesleyan Athletics Director Derek Zander said. "Every effort will be made to reschedule varsity contests that are postponed between now and April 3. In addition, all athletic facilities on Iowa Wesleyan's campus, including the weight room, fitness center, Old Gymnasium, walking track, and Ruble Arena are closed to the public, effective March 16 at 5 p.m.
   
 "Health screenings will occur regularly to ensure the safety of our student- athletes, faculty and staff, as well as the community of Mount Pleasant."

About 600 Red Cross blood drives have been canceled across the country due to coronavirus concerns, resulting in approximately 18,000 fewer blood donations.


  As of late last week, 57 drives had been canceled, leaving 1,617 blood donations uncollected in the state.


  "We expect these numbers to grow with the number of COVID-19 cases on the rise, making it difficult to sustain the blood supply for patients in need," Isenor said. "The American Red Cross is urging healthy, eligible individuals to give blood or platelets now to help prevent blood shortages that could result from lower donor participation."


  The need for blood and platelets is constant, and donors are the only source of blood for those in need of transfusions, including accident and burn victims, heart surgery and organ transplant patients, and those receiving treatment for leukemia, cancer or sickle cell disease.


  "There is always that chance that if the blood supply reaches unsustainable levels, patient care could suffer," Isenor said.


  Blood donors with type O blood and all platelet donors are especially needed right now.


  “We’re asking the American people to help keep the blood supply stable during this challenging time. As communities across the country prepare for this public health emergency, it’s critical that plans include a readily available blood supply for hospital patients,” said Chris Hrouda, president of Red Cross Blood Services. “As fears of coronavirus rise, low donor participation could harm blood availability at hospitals, and the last thing a patient should worry about is whether lifesaving blood will be on the shelf when they need it most.”


  Donating blood is a safe process and people should not hesitate to give or receive blood, Red Cross officials add. There is no data or evidence that this coronavirus can be transmissible by blood transfusion, and there have been no reported cases worldwide of transmissions for any respiratory virus, including this coronavirus, from a transfusion.


  "Giving blood is not only a safe process, but by doing so, they can help ensure medical care continues uninterrupted for patients who depend on lifesaving transfusions," Isenor added.


  The Red Cross only collects blood from individuals who are healthy and feeling well at the time of donation -- and who meet other eligibility requirements listed at its website, RedCrossBlood.org. At each blood drive and donation center, Red Cross employees follow thorough safety protocols including wearing gloves, routinely wiping down donor-touched areas, using sterile collection sets for every donation, and preparing the arm for donation with an aseptic scrub.


  These mitigation measures will help ensure blood recipient safety, as well as staff and donor safety in reducing contact with those who may potentially have this respiratory infection, Red Cross officials say.


  Out of an abundance of caution, The Red Cross has also implemented new screening procedures for donors. Individuals are asked to postpone their donation for 28 days following travel to China and Hong Kong and Macau, as well as Iran, Italy and South Korea; and for a diagnosis of COVID-19 or contact with a person who has or is suspected to have the virus.


  Even before the virus hit, the Red Cross had issued an urgent call for donors of all blood types to give blood or platelets.

ALBANY - New York City will limit its restaurants, bars and cafes to serving only take-out and delivery customers by Tuesday morning, a dramatic step to try and slow the spread of the novel coronavirus in the nation's most populous city.
   
 All nightclubs, theaters and concert venues will also be ordered to close, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced late Sunday.
   
 De Blasio said he will sign an executive order Monday putting his directive into place.
   
 It will take effect 9 a.m. Tuesday morning, he said.
   
 "This is not a decision I make lightly," de Blasio said in a 10 p.m. statement. "These places are part of the heart and soul of our city. They are part of what it means to be a New Yorker. But our city is facing an unprecedented threat, and we must respond with a wartime mentality."
   
 The move comes as governors of five states -- California, Ohio, Illinois, Massachusetts and Washington -- took action to close restaurants or bars or limit them to takeout and delivery.
   
 New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo had already put significant restrictions into place last week as the coronavirus spread through his state, banning gatherings of more than 500 people and restricting maximum occupancy for other businesses by 50%.
   
 Cuomo's order had already shuttered large theaters throughout the state, including those on Broadway in the city. He warned he would take more dramatic action -- perhaps limiting bars and restaurants to 30% capacity -- if business owners didn't follow his order.
   
 De Blasio's order takes it a step further, forcing all theaters regardless of size to close, including movie theaters.
   
 "Now it is time to take yet another drastic step," de Blasio said in his statement. "The virus can spread rapidly through the close interactions New Yorkers have in restaurants, bars and places where we sit close together. We have to break that cycle."
   
 As of Sunday morning, New York state had 729 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus. New York City had 329 confirmed cases as of Sunday evening, including five deaths.
   
 Also on Sunday, de Blasio and Cuomo announced New York City's school system -- the largest public system in the country -- would shut down beginning Monday for over a month.
   
 The city's announcement followed a wave of school closures throughout the state, with all school districts in at least 52 of the state's 62 counties closing at some point this week.

 The general response to an economic downturn from the government would be to increase spending to provide an economic boost.

And, by running large deficits and adding to the debt even when there is no recession, the Liberals have deprived our country of fiscal room that could be used to respond to a crisis.
 Finally, the Liberals are running up big budget deficits at low interest rates. When interest rates rise, the cost of serving that increased debt will also rise.

  And for those communities with open town meetings — how will those be handled in light of the coronavirus pandemic? If you think about it, that’s quite an opportunity for the virus to spread.


  You gather a few hundred people (depending on a lot of conditions) in a school gymnasium or auditorium, in relatively close quarters. You have many of them sharing microphones and standing in line to get to them. You have people checking in attendees as they enter. You have tellers tallying ballots, or mingling among the people as they count those who stand to vote.


  Already there has been legislation drafted to extend the time frame during which town meetings can legally be held, in an attempt to perhaps outwait the virus or let mitigation and containment efforts progress. Not to exaggerate the threat, but how much risk is acceptable for ordinary citizens to assume in order to participate in their local government?


  Municipal government may rate fairly low on the priority list of things the average citizen worries about given the pandemic today. But let’s remember those governments are made up of people who work to represent us all. They are our friends, our neighbors our family.


  They are us.

With the U.S. Capitol among the many iconic landmarks closed to tours, Pelosi also urged lawmakers to have most of their Washington staff telework from home, as health officials urge social distancing. House lawmakers are away on weeklong recess and many have already curtailed office visits at their local offices, as well.
 Fauci, the public face of the administration’s messaging during a round of morning TV interviews, said the country should do as much as “we possibly could,” even if officials were criticized for overreacting. He said he raised the issue of measures such as a shutdown with the Trump administration, and said officials were open to his ideas.
 “I think Americans should be prepared that they are going to have to hunker down significantly more than we as a country are doing,” said Fauci, who heads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health.
 For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The worldwide outbreak has sickened more than 156,000 people and left more than 5,800 dead. The death toll in the United States is more than 50, while infections neared 3,000 across 49 states and the District of Columbia.
 The vast majority of people recover. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three weeks to six weeks to recover.
 Trump in recent days has imposed sweeping travel restrictions for much of Europe. On Saturday, he added the United Kingdom and Ireland to a list of countries that would face travel restrictions over the next 30 days. The State Department on Sunday said it would allow U.S. personnel to leave their diplomatic or consular posts worldwide if they or family members were medically determined to be at a higher risk of falling very ill if exposed to the virus.
 Trump also has pledged broadened U.S. testing for the virus as major employers such as Apple Inc. have sent workers home to telework and several states and big cities, including Los Angeles and Boston, shuttered down schools for a week or more.
 Trump has suggested that restrictions on travel within the U.S. to areas hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic could be next. But Fauci on Sunday played down that or having major national lockdowns on the level now seen in European countries such as Italy and Spain.

Jyotiraditya Scindia resigned from Congress and joined BJP, the party of his grandmother and two aunts. Madhya Pradesh Congress satraps would have welcomed Jyotiraditya’s exit. But what is worrying them is the ‘tremors from the falling of a big tree’ — the resignation of 22 Congress MLAs. A major concern for the Congress leadership is the looming danger of losing the reins of a big state, earned with a razor-thin majority after a hard fought election in December 2018. As the Karnataka experiment gets repeated in Madhya Pradesh, the worrying factor for democracy is that MLAs are happily courting disqualification or tendering resignations for a better deal in the new dispensation. The Tenth Schedule, inserted in the Constitution in 1985 after bitter experiences of governments falling prey to defections of MLAs, is silent on this new resignation formula to destabilise governments. The 1960s and 1970s political arena was marked by ‘Aya Rams and Gaya Rams’, the coinage credited to Haryana MLA Gaya Lal who changed his loyalty to parties thrice in a short span of time in 1967. Haryana had two other stalwarts in the defection game — Rao Birendra Singh and Bhajan Lal. Bhajan Lal in 1980 had defected to Congress after Indira Gandhi returned to power post-Emergency. He along with his ministers and MLAs merged with Congress to remain chief minister. Probably that made Parliament in March 1985 to insert Tenth Schedule, which then had validated defection of one-third of MLAs of a party and merger of one party with another if two-thirds of MLAs of the merging party favoured it. The Tenth Schedule gave the Speaker of Lok Sabha and assemblies unquestionable power in deciding petitions seeking disqualification of MLAs under the anti-defection law. This was challenged in the Supreme Court, which by a slender 3-2 majority in Kihoto Hollohan case [1992 Supp (2) SCC 651] ruled that Speakers, while deciding petitions under anti-defection law, exercised judicial powers akin to a tribunal and hence their decisions would be subject to scrutiny of HCs and the SC. Since then, the SC has been called upon numerous times to decide the validity of Speakers’ decisions under the anti-defection law, which indicated rampancy of defection and Tenth Schedule’s limited deterrence effect. Finding split and merger concessions in the Tenth Schedule getting exploited repeatedly, the NDA government under Atal Bihari Vajapayee through Parliament effected the 91st Constitutional Amendment in 2003, which prohibited defections through split and merger. It also capped the number of ministers in a government as experience showed that the carrot of ministerial berths to engineer defections led to jumbo-sized council of ministers. With the anti- defection law plugging exit routes for MLAs and given the mind-boggling cost of re-election, it was hoped that there would be political stability in governance after exploration of opportunities for post-poll alliances between parties. But with the political manoeuvres of BJP, having been entrenched in federal governance, increasingly resembling the machinations of Congress in the last quarter of the 20th century, the anti-defection law appears to be in need of some urgent surgical treatment through constitutional amendment. Penning the minority opinion in Kihoto Hollohan judgment, Justice J S Verma had noticed that under Articles 103 and 192, disqualification of MPs/MLAs was to be decided by the President/governor after consulting the Election Commission. Finding that Tenth Schedule vested disqualification powers with the Speaker, he had raised doubts about the impartiality of Speaker. “Speaker being an authority within the House and his tenure being dependent on the will of the majority therein, likelihood of suspicion of bias could not be ruled out. The question as to disqualification of a member has adjudicatory disposition and, therefore, requires the decision to be rendered in consonance with the scheme for adjudication of disputes,” the minority opinion had said. A similar view on erosion of traditional impartiality attached to Speaker was expressed by the SC through Justice N V Ramana in a recent judgment in the case relating to disqualification of Karnataka rebel MLAs. The limitations of anti-defection law were evident from the fact that 17 MLAs, who resigned/were disqualified by the Speaker for anti-party activities, sought re-election and 11 of them got re-elected. Ten of them got ministerial berths in the B S Yediyurappa government that was formed after the H D Kumaraswamy government collapsed. The SC in the Karnataka rebel MLAs case had said, “His (Speaker’s) political affiliations cannot come in the way of adjudication (of disqualification petitions)… There is a growing trend of Speakers acting against the constitutional duty of being neutral. Additionally, political parties are indulging in horse-trading and corrupt practices, due to which citizens are denied stable governments. In these circumstances, Parliament is required to reconsider strengthening certain aspects of the Tenth Schedule, so that such undemocratic practices are discouraged.” Probably, the solution lies in creating an independent authority to deal with disqualification of MPs and MLAs under the Tenth Schedule. Justice Verma in Hollohan judgment had said, “Tenure of the Speaker, who is the authority in the Tenth Schedule to decide this dispute, is dependent on the continuous support of the majority in the House and, therefore, he does not satisfy the requirement of such an independent adjudicatory authority; and his choice as the sole arbiter in the matter violates an essential attribute of the basic feature.” It is now for Parliament to decide.

The idea is that the memes should be regulated and intellectual property use restrictions enforced. This “we must regulate the memes” kind of thinking is everywhere these days. The fact that in this case, it’s the beloved, ubiquitous, Baby Yoda, may actually help to expose how silly and censorious this perspective is. We’ve seen this rhetorical gambit deployed in the realms of music, movies, video games, and of course, politics—“we can’t control what’s being said; therefore it must be stopped.” But Sheppard is not the only one demanding meme control, as if such a thing is even really possible.
 During the recent Canadian election, Melanie Green wrote a similar article called “Why political memes—which are virtually unregulated—matter to this federal election” in which she complained that viral political memes are not regulated by the government. Green cites a communications professor who created a “meme encyclopedia” and a data researcher in an attempt to paint regular people sharing jokes and opinions in meme form in a bad light. As though it is even relevant whether these memes are viewed positively or negatively with regard to free speech considerations.
 It was authoritarian drivel, a missive in favour of shutting down views she didn’t agree with, or found annoying, or thought would unduly influence people—despite her inability to be unduly influenced by the pervasive memes. Now the target isn’t political in nature, but cultural. Apparently seeing Baby Yoda outside of a carefully choreographed, scripted CGI sequence is just beyond the pale. Sheppard wants fans to have less control over their preferred story verse, while fans are continually clamouring for more.

BOSTON -- In a dramatic escalation of the state's response to the spreading coronavirus outbreak, Gov. Charlie Baker on Sunday announced that all Massachusetts public schools must soon close for three weeks, most events with 25 or more people are now banned, and visitors are barred from the state's nursing homes and assisted-living facilities.
 New responses unveiled Sunday also include a mandate that all restaurants and bars transition to takeout-only to prevent crowds, a requirement that commercial health insurers cover telemedicine, and steps aimed at making unemployment aid more easily accessible.
 The sweeping announcements came hours after the total number of identified COVID-19 cases in Massachusetts hit 164 and as Public Health Commissioner Monica Bharel announced that community-level transmission -- where investigators cannot trace an individual case back to a source -- is now occurring in seven counties.
 "I realize these measures are unprecedented, but we're asking our residents to take a deep breath and understand the rationale behind this guidance," Baker said, stressing the response could save lives, enable the health care sector to avoid an unmanageable surge, and limit the already rapid spread of the illness.
 Public and private K-12 schools will be allowed to return Monday, but starting Tuesday, they must suspend all educational operations until April 7. Baker urged staff to plan for how to provide alternative and remote learning resources equitably to all students during the shutdown.
 District buildings can still open to provide food to students or other important non-educational services. Residential and day schools for students with special needs are exempt, as are day care facilities and preschools.
 Baker had resisted ordering a statewide educational shutdown for several days, even as many districts enacted their own weekslong suspensions and governors in other states implemented similar policies.
 "The facts on the ground have changed," Baker said Sunday. "At this point in time, it's particularly appropriate that we not only move on the school closures, but also that we get a lot more aggressive around other places and spaces that people gather."
 Two days ago, Baker issued an emergency order banning gatherings of 250 or more people such as conventions, parades and concerts.
 On Sunday, he scaled that threshold down to one-tenth its original scope, updating the order to prohibit events that would bring together 25 or more people in an effort to impose social distancing practices that public health experts say are necessary to slow the virus's spread.
 The updated order also forbids on-premises consumption of food or drink, effectively requiring all restaurants and bars to transition to takeout-only from its March 17 effective date until at least April 5.
 The order banning large gatherings does not apply to normal operations at grocery or retail businesses.
 Massachusetts has 164 identified coronavirus cases as of Sunday, a more than fivefold increase over the total cases one week ago.
 Three commercial laboratories -- Thermo Fischer, Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp -- have received federal approval to conduct COVID-19 tests, supplementing the roughly 400 tests per day the state's public health laboratory will soon be able to conduct.
 At least 969 tests have been done so far between the state lab and private labs, Bharel said. The governor warned this morning that he expects the numbers of total cases to rise significantly as more tests are conducted.
 While the majority of cases trace back to a late February meeting of Biogen employees in Boston, community spread is becoming more common. The state's public health commissioner said Berkshire, Essex, Hampden, Middlesex, Norfork, Suffolk and Worcester Counties all have evidence of community-level transmission as of Sunday.
 "This is an evolving situation," Bharel said. "Social distancing is our collective opportunity to influence the course of this illness and flatten the curve. Each of us needs to do our part."
 Officials also announced a range of health care-specific restrictions Sunday.
 Hospitals must cancel nonessential elective surgeries until further notice starting Wednesday, and those operated by DPH or the state Department of Mental Health must screen all visitors and limit visitation.
 All assisted-living facilities, including nursing homes, can no longer allow visitors, a step that officials hope will limit transmission risk to especially vulnerable populations. Exceptions will be made for end-of-life and hospice care, and the restriction follows federal guidelines issued Friday.
 As of Monday, all commercial health insurance carriers and the Group Insurance Commission will be required to cover all medically necessary telehealth services -- treatment offered by doctors over the phone or a video conference -- and pay the same rates as in-person care. They are also prohibited from requiring cost-sharing or prior authorization for any COVID-19 telehealth treatment.
 "Telemedicine is one of the most important things we need to divert care from hospitals and ambulatory sites from patients," said Marylou Sudders, who stepped aside from her usual duties running the health and human services secretariat to lead the state's coronavirus command center. "By enabling patients to remain at home, rapid treatment delivery can be provided, we can adhere to social distancing protocols, we can optimize efficiency and conserve resources."
 The public health orders also authorize certain pharmacies to create their own hand sanitizer and sell it over the counter to supplement stockpiles.
 Baker said he would file emergency legislation on Monday that waives the one- week waiting period for unemployment benefits and expanding eligibility, aiming to allow "many of the workers affected by closures to get some financial relief faster."
 According to the governor's office, the Executive Office of Labor and Workforce Development will also file emergency regulations allowing employees affected by the coronavirus to collect unemployment if their workplace shuts down with plans to reopen within four weeks.
 Baker's legislation will attempt to address issues municipalities have raised amid the outbreak, such as the potential need to delay annual town meetings and fiscal year 2021 municipal budget discussions that typically take place in the spring.
 The Registry of Motor Vehicles will add a 60-day extension to the expiration date for standard driver licenses and other credentials to limit how many customers visit service centers. Vehicle registrations, many of which can be renewed online, will not be extended.

Bitcoin Cash bulls are tired of watching from the sidelines but focus on breaking the resistance at $200. Technical indicators begin to align for a possible bullish reversal above the seller congestion at $200. Bitcoin Cash is the only cryptocurrency asset in the green among the major digital assets on Monday. The just-concluded weekend session was mostly bearish but bulls were this time around, alert and committed to defending key support areas. All the top three cryptocurrency assets; Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple are in the red towards the end of the Asian session and are posting subtle losses between 0.1% and 1%. In the meantime, Bitcoin Cash is trading at $181 after a minor upward adjustment from $174 (intraday low). On the upside, an intraday high has been achieved at $184.21.

To those of us who really wanted 2020 to crush once and for all the poorly documented notion that Clinton lost because of her gender, the willingness of these two men to choose a female running mate was at best a consolation prize. But depending on the circumstances and the identity of the woman in question, it could be a pretty big deal. Given their respective ages, Biden and Sanders are much better than average bets to be one-term presidents if they win in November. That would almost certainly make the vice-president the putative party leader and front-runner for the big job in 2024. And while we all focus on the fact that women have so far been denied the presidency, they’ve been denied the vice-presidency as well. It’s been _36 years_ since Geraldine Ferraro became the first woman (and so far, the only Democratic woman) to be nominated for vice-president. That Biden and (to a slightly lesser extent) Sanders feel breaking that drought is obligatory this year is a sign of real, if grossly overdue, progress.

Those touched by this malady find that their ability to tell time and discern the difference between the present and the future has been strongly impaired. The carriers of this sickness are confused as to the very season our nation now finds itself.
 They conflate things, which no sensible person would conflate. The primary symptom of their malady is the driving tendency to believe the events of 2023 will be decided before we even exit the year 2020.
 Consequently, everything they say and do is geared toward obsessive jockeying for position to control and manipulate a race still three years away. In doing so, they recklessly undermine the very party which they claim to serve and weaken the administration of President Buhari to which they claim to be loyal. They line up to run a race for which the track has not even yet been constructed.
 Put another way, they seek to pluck the fruit before the seed is even planted. As such, their actions border on the pathological. True, ambition is inherent in human endeavour. Without it, nothing great is achieved. However, strong ambition applied in the wrong way has never done anything positive.
 At best, it results in confusion. Usually, its results in something worse. No matter how great one’s ambition and how able one may be, nobody can rush or speed time. That is beyond the realm of human capacity. To do so is to contest against fate itself. When it ends, such a contest rarely ends well.
 In a well-structured society, people come to understand that the time for politics is seasonal; it is periodic. The responsibilities of governance are what is perpetual. Many of our politicians sadly have inverted this reality. Politics and electioneering are secondary to governance for they are but tools of governance, the platforms by which one demonstrates his or her worthiness to lead a great people.
 The more a person obsesses over and constantly engages in political manoeuvring is a warning sign. Not only is he prone to the 2023 virus. He likely has little to offer in the way of good governance. He wants to hold public office that you might serve him not he serve you. For if he had adequately studied and been acquainted with the ways and means of progressive governance, he would be focused on that important task at the present moment. He certainly would not drown himself and all around him in harmful political intrigue.
 It is against this backdrop that we should view the present ploys and plots to undermine the APC National Chairman. The Chairman is human; thus, he has his merits as well as his flaws. Yet his humanity cannot be grounds for his dismissal. If so, the position will forever go vacant.
 The Chairman has been a tireless campaigner and mobilizer for the party. He has steered the party through difficult elections. His contributions should not be undervalued now that the bulk of elections are behind us. To do so would be an act of ingratitude. It is no secret that the Chairman and Edo Governor Obaseki are in dispute. This is unfortunate.
 However, the party has moved through proper procedures within the proper organs of the party to hopefully resolve this spat. All party members know this. Such decisions are part and parcel of internal party governance. Yet, motivated by ambitions that have nothing to do with the quality of the Chairman’s performance, people shunned the agreed party reconciliation mechanism and resorted to other means to oust him. These self-help attempts are unwarranted. These attempts reveal more about the mala fides of their perpetrators than they do about the Chairman.
 The plotters launched their attack solely because they perceive the chairman as an obstacle to their 2023 ambitions. People went to court knowing full well the party constitution prohibits such action because these people had not yet exhausted all internal disciplinary procedures.
 We even had a national deputy secretary improperly call for a NEC meeting on the basis that he believed himself the acting national chairman. Clearly, this man would not have summoned the temerity to make such a move had he not been instigated by powerful individuals who he thought would reward or, at least, protect him for committing the wrongful act.
 Those engaged in these manoeuvres see themselves as clever or cunning. They do so because they only understand the mean craft of political intrigue. They have yet to understand the value and long-term utility of democratic governance. Thus, they embark on the strangest of quest. They would rather dismantle and weaken the institutional core of their party just to gain control of that weakened edifice in order to pilfer the party nomination, which they crave. This is more than sad.
 Many of us expended sweat, tears, toil and sleepless nights to build this party. Our personal sacrifices were not insignificant. We built this party not simply as a vehicle for personal ambition. We built the party because we saw it as perhaps the only enduring hope to bring progressive governance to this nation. Those who now seek to abuse the party by using it as their personal device do it great harm. They should not be allowed to sacrifice this collective enterprise at the altar of their self-aggrandizement. Somehow, some way they should find in themselves the bearing to adhere to the democratic spirit on which the party was founded. To be an APC member means more than merely carrying a membership card. It means to believe in a set of ideals and principles geared to our highest purpose as a party and a nation.
 In a broader context, those afflicted with the 2023 virus do a grave disservice to President Buhari and his administration. They should be trying their best to help the president. Instead of seeing President Buhari as our present leader and commander-in-chief, their sole contemplation is upon his eventual exit. Yet, not even a full year has passed since his second inaugural. How can they be committed to helping him realise his mandate when the fullness of their gaze is affixed to seizing this very mandate for themselves?
 The President is faced with many challenges. He is fighting hard on security to keep the population safe. He is pushing for economic reforms that will augur future sustainable growth. His disdain for corruption remains unwavering. Add to it now the Corona crisis and its resultant social as well as economic impact. Politicians express loyalty to him but the words of too many of our politicians are like butter under a burning sun; they melt quickly away. Better to be loyal in deed. Instead of trying to manipulate party and other mechanisms solely to their political gain, it is time to shelve political intrigue for the time being. It is time for all party members to truly see what is at stake and work with Mr. President for the collective good of the nation.
 This means we must rally around President Buhari. Instead of everyone saying they are working for the party and nation but going their separate ways based on their selfish designs, we must help him build a stronger national consensus on policies that will ensure safety and bring greater prosperity. If need be and when called upon, we must offer ideas and suggestions that move policy and progress forward. This is the time for governance. It is not the moment to bring the politics of 2023 into 2020. In due course, 2023 shall come. Nothing can prevent it. However, that time is not today. If we are earnest, the present offers sufficient work and challenges for us without trying to add to it by rushing the future. Let us dedicate our energies to helping President Buhari win the present. In this way, you better secure the future for the nation, the party and even for whatever personal ambitions you may nurture.
 I have said what is on my mind in hopes that some people may leave the 2023 frenzy and commit themselves to the harder yet more rewarding task of improving progressive governance, whether within the party or at the local, state or federal levels. Yet, I am not so naïve to think all will heed this counsel. The stubborn, those obsessed with the obsession of their ambitions, will ignore all advice. They will constantly pull 2023 into all that occurs in 2020. Their vision is blurred and judgment made faulty by their ailment. We are democrats so we cannot physically quarantine them. However, we can quarantine their ideas and antics by not falling prey to them. This is the best way we help President Buhari fulfil his mandate and inoculate our party and the nation from grave folly.
