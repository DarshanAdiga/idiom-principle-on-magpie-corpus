Oktay during his speech at the ceremony underlined that Turkey seeks to widen cooperation and constructive diplomacy in the conflicts in the area – especially in the Eastern Mediterranean.

The Greek Cypriot administration continues to oppose recognition of the political equality of Turkish Cypriots and claims to be the island's sole legitimate government, while its unilateral declaration of exclusive economic zones (EEZ) in the Eastern Mediterranean and initiation of drilling activities in the region have been a cause for concern to the island's north. Meanwhile, the recent unilateral opening of non-military areas of the British Sovereign Base Areas for development by the U.K. and the Greek Cyprus administration remain obstacles for a permanent solution.

But if it was U.S. policy that pushed the world higher then, it is U.S. policy that threatens to pull the world under now as the country’s troubled response to the coronavirus pandemic emerges as a chief risk to any sustained global recovery.

"Globally there will be difficult months and years ahead and it is of particular concern that the number of COVID-19 cases is still rising," the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said in a review of the U.S. economy that cited "social unrest" due to rising poverty as one of the risks to economic growth.

The decades since have seen several attempts to resolve the dispute, all ending in failure. The latest one, held with the participation of the guarantor countries – Turkey, Greece and the U.K. – ended in 2017 in Switzerland.

A total of 103 Turkish Cypriot villages were attacked, leading to the deaths of hundreds. In fact, the bloody campaign led to the displacement of 30,000 Turkish Cypriots, who had to take shelter in an area constituting merely 3% of the island.

Speaking during the ceremony, Akıncı noted that there were times when a solution seemed imminent. "However, no result has been reached due to reasons not stemming from us," he stated.

Turkey is a treasure trove of ancient mosaics that once adorned the walls and floors of palaces and houses of nobles of ancient civilizations. Many mosaics have been unearthed during ongoing excavations, especially in the southeastern provinces of Gaziantep and Hatay.

The chain of events that set the stage for Turkey's Cyprus Peace Operation in 1974 has its roots in the mid-1950s, when EOKA, a terror group seeking "Enosis" (the annexation of islands in favor of Greece) started oppressing and killing local Turkish Cypriots.

In July 2013, officials in the village of Yavru carried out a salvaging mission at a site where an illegal archaeological dig had been attempted. It was here that a 24-square-meter (258-square-feet) mosaic belonging to the floor of a chapel was discovered.

The Peace Operation, which was Turkey's first independent military venture abroad in the Republican era, followed two decades of intercommunal violence which saw Turkish Cypriots targeted by Greek Cypriot pro-independence militias during the British colonial rule and after independence. In response, Turkish Cypriots were confined to certain enclaves to protect themselves from ongoing violence.

"The risk ahead is that a large share of the U.S. population will have to contend with an important deterioration of living standards and significant economic hardship for several years. This, in turn, can further weaken demand and exacerbate longer-term headwinds to growth."

The mosaic depicts apples, an apple tree, partridges and a plethora of geometric figures. It has since been brought to Amasya Archeology Museum following the successful completion of the renovation work.

"Turkish Cypriots ... are struggling for equality for more than 50 years... (have) fought despite all kinds of pressures and threats, and claimed their rights and freedom," Erdoğan continued in his message. "As always, Turkey will make every effort to protect Turkish Cypriots' rights and the rule of law. I commemorate our martyrs who sacrificed their lives in the struggle for liberation, and our veterans with gratitude and respect. I present my best wishes for the peace, welfare and happiness of our brothers and sisters in the TRNC."

Akıncı signed a visitors' book at the event hailing Atatürk, the founder of Turkey, and wrote that Turkish Cypriots still sought a permanent solution to the Cyprus issue with a peace-based approach. Oktay, meanwhile, wrote that Turkey would remain a guarantor of peace and stability in the region, and that both Turks and Turkish Cypriots were deeply connected. Turkey, he added, is determined to stand behind Turkish Cypriots whenever needed.
