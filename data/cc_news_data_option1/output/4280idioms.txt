FILE - In this Saturday, Sept. 12, 2020, file photo, fans join in singing "The Eyes of Texas" after Texas defeated UTEP 59-3 in an NCAA college football game in Austin, Texas. Texas athletic director Chris Del Conte said Wednesday, Oct. 14, 2020, he expects players to “stand together as a unified group” to show appreciation for the school and fans during the playing of the school song “The Eyes of Texas” after games, but didn't say what will happen if they refuse. The song has exploded into a thorny controversy after several football players and other athletes said over the summer they no longer wanted to sing it because of its uncomfortable connections to racist elements of the school's past. less

  With numerous employers accepting applications, PA CareerLink will hold a virtual job fair from 1 to 5 p.m. Wednesday, Oct. 28. The fair will focus on manufacturing positions as October is Manufacturing Month.


  Thus far, Mercaldo said 14 employers representing 400 open positions have signed up to participate in the fair.


  According to a press release on the job fair, the manufacturing industry provides 34,600 jobs throughout the region. The average package of wages and benefits for those positions total more than $65,000 per year.


  While PA CareerLink traditionally held large in-person job fairs in the spring and fall, Mercaldo said the pandemic has caused the focus to shift to virtual job fairs.

Azlan Raj, Chief Marketing Officer EMEA of data-driven, technology-enabled performance marketing agency Merkle, said: “The record reduction in budgets, and recurrent Covid-19 lockdown restrictions have left the industry low on both confidence and optimism. Just 3 in 10 of respondents are feeling more optimistic about their own companies' financial prospects than in Q2, and there's a very real risk that low confidence could itself become a self- fulfilling prophecy of stagnant growth or further retrenched budgets. The green shoots may not feel 'immediate', but there are opportunities to get ahead of the curve and back to growth. As we try and get back to normal, consumers are still very much unsettled by what's going on in the world, and not just Covid-19, but the US election and Brexit too. Brands that can truly support their customers to navigate safely through the stormy waters of 2020, have much to gain. So we'd expect to see a shift in 'pay and spray' approaches to advertising, and a greater investment in digital, data and customer experience. The number of touchpoints is still growing, as what customers consider 'ads' diminishes, so both into Winter and beyond into 2021, we anticipate that kneejerk digital transformation caused by the Coronavirus will need to mature into strategically-driven, experience-led investment.”

The highest within the past 10 years was 436,700 in March of 2019, less than a year before the virus struck.


  “We called it our carryout season,” said Marty Hutnick, the owner of the Four Corners Diner in the small southeast Michigan village of Romeo. “There were only three to four of us working, so it was hard. But that’s what helped keep our doors open.”


  Hutnick credits the “phenomenal community” for helping keep the establishment afloat. When they weren’t buying carryout, many customers purchased gift certificates. A few customers even went as far as helping the restaurant pay the bills for rent and electricity.


  “The stress that it caused on me personally was very hard,” Hutnick said. “I don’t think people realize what goes on behind the scenes. I wanted to give up and turn the lock.” Compared to other business owners, Hutnick considers herself lucky to have survived carryout season.


  “Some industries have not been hit as hard as others,” said Otie McKinley, the media and communications manager of the Michigan Economic Development Corp. and Pure Michigan. “When you look at the tourism industry and small businesses, they have been catastrophically impacted.”


  The agency launched 19 coronavirus response programs to assist businesses during the pandemic. Working closely with local partners and agencies, the corporation used funding provided by the federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act that was implemented at the end of March. About $100 million went toward supporting communities across the state through the Michigan Small Business Restart Grant program, McKinley said.


  “As we work to rebuild our economy, we want to do so in a way that creates a more equitable and resilient economy than what we had going into COVID-19,” he said.


  The Michigan Restaurant and Lodging Association worked with lawmakers to ease the virus’ impact on the hospitality industry. It supported a bill passed in July that let restaurants sell liquor to-go with limited customer contact.


  The legislation also permits cities to establish social districts for people to dine and drink from open containers outside. East Lansing blocked off a portion of Albert Street, home to many restaurants, and set up picnic tables for sitting and dining or drinking.


  “Closing Albert and having the social zone so close to us was an additional revenue stream that we’ve never had before,” said Bryan Ponke, the general manager at HopCat’s East Lansing location. “Even though our restaurant occupancy was limited and our sales were negatively impacted by COVID-19, we saw an outstanding spike in takeout sales.”


  HopCat used the garage doors on the side of its building as its takeout window. Guests could order and pick up their drinks and food from the safety of the sidewalk. According to Ponke, the social district definitely helped business.

Spend is very much dependent on the sectors in which your clients operate, and for every loser there is more often than not a winner, and a winner happy to invest. New business volumes have also increased substantially, so any reports that the industry is dead on its feet are a little wide of the mark!"

Maybe it was because new rules allowed muting of candidates' mics when the other was speaking, or because President Trump's advisers urged him to play it cool during one of the last major events of the election season. Asked about the pandemic, Trump argued the situation could be a lot worse and that the virus is "going away" despite surging numbers around the country. He also tried to find traction with unsubstantiated and convoluted claims about Biden's son, Hunter Biden, which have failed to manifest into the October surprise many Trump supporters hoped for. Trump also cast Joe Biden as a typical politician who hasn't solved major issues during his decades in office. For his part, Biden talked about moving away from an oil-based economy and increasing the minimum wage. He also said the Trump administration's practice of separating families at the southern border has made the US a "laughingstock" on the world stage.

Will's been that amazing chop tackler that's given blokes around him the opportunity to get on that ball, and again his work-rate is relentless.” Catt believes there is much more to come from Connors than his prodigious work ethic in defence.


  “I think Will's very underrated in terms of his handling ability, it's never really been used with the Leinster way. Again he's exceptionally quick into breakdowns, not just defensively, attacking-wise too. And he's got a real understanding of the game.
