But, the underlying cause, the overburdening, is that stock prices have been inflated into an unsustainable bubble by a decade of unprecedentedly low interest rates. The old idea that extreme swings “regress to the mean” applies in spades to stock prices. We have had a long and unprecedented bull market upswing since 2009 price lows in the aftermath of last decade's financial debacle. This upswing became unsustainable. History told us prices would fall eventually despite any spin or hyping by administration officials or Wall Street bulls. The only unknown was what would be the precipitating factor. The COVID-19 came along -- an unforeseen excuse to sell.

“Our Town gives local residents the opportunity to showcase their favorite qualities and distinct features of their town, told from their own perspective, in their own words,” Rhode Island PBS President David W. Piccerelli said. “The project slogan is ‘your voice, your vision’ and we are excited to see what South Kingstown has to offer.”
 The Our Town team is headed by project director Jodi Mesolella and producer Nicole Muri. Muri’s name might sound familiar – she worked at channels 6, 10 and 12 in Rhode Island.
 The series has been in the works for several years. To date, the Our Town team has visited 11 Ocean State towns, with 20 left to go. Residents from neighboring North Kingstown and Charlestown have taken part in it. The state’s eight cities aren’t eligible for the project at this time.
 According to R.I. PBS, the purpose of the Our Town project is to share the charm and character of Rhode Island towns and villages - in particular, untold or uncelebrated stories that capture the essence of life in the town.
 Building community by enhancing connections and relationships between Rhode Island PBS and town residents, the stories are told by resident storytellers and videographers, who choose the stories they want to tell about their town. The role of Rhode Island PBS is to offer technical advice and then stitch together the stories into a one-hour film.
 After the producers visit a town, the resulting documentary is shown on PBS, posted to the R.I. PBS website and made available as a YouTube video. Each town gets its own page on the PBS site as well.
 Local businesses and organizations serve as sponsors for each video, providing additional hometown ties.

He rigged up a blue light bulb to an extension cord, ran it all the way downstairs from her bedside and hooked it to the chandelier over our dining- room table. He took the bell away from her and told Edith to just pull on the string and we would see the light. He was very pleased with himself, and the first time that blue light came on, Daddy himself ran up to find out what 'the little darling' needed. He came back down and maybe managed two bites when the light came on again. He motioned to one of my siblings to do the running while Daddy continued eating and telling us his stories.

The complaint filed in June 2019 by South Kingstown resident Deborah Bergner said that Markey did not remove herself from such discussions on seven occasions between Dec. 11, 2018 and May 14 of 2019.
 At two other times, both on April 9, she recused herself but did not leave the room, Bergner’s complaint says.
 The Ethics Commission met behind closed doors about the matter June 18 and voted to proceed with the investigation, which took several months and was continued several times until early this year.
 Bergner’s complaint stemmed from instances when NEASK President Brian Nelson and Vice-President Mick Lefort appeared before the South Kingstown School Committee.
 Among Nelson’s appearances, he “presented the position of the bargaining unit regarding the school calendar” (Dec. 11, 2018), “presented concerns about working conditions under the new facility plans and their importance to the teaching community” (Jan. 10, 2019), “presented concerns and requested actions by the committee regarding Personnel Action Team policy” (Feb. 12, 2019), “presented concerns to a joint budget session with the Town Council and School Committee present” (March 13), “presented support for the new PAT process” (April 9) and “discussed implications of the new PAT process” (May 14).
 Lefort also presented clarifications about the PAT process April 9 – the date Markey recused herself from discussions – and on Feb. 12 he “presented concerns about Teacher’s College Reading and Writing Program while advocating for a reduction in administrative staff” and “presented results of a bargaining unit survey regarding Teacher’s College that he had emailed to the School Committee.”
 Bergner cited state law and an earlier ethics advisory opinion that Markey sought, arguing that she “should recuse herself from participation in the discussion of any matter related to NEARI and any NEARI-associated individuals that appear before the School Committee.”

Rather than scanning an app, Just Walk Out—the name of the technology—allows shoppers to simply insert a credit card into a turnstile in order to enter. As shoppers pick up items, the items will be placed into the customer’s virtual shopping cart. Once the individual exits the store, their credit card will be billed, completely negating checkout lines or scanning bar codes on items. (Source: Reuters)
