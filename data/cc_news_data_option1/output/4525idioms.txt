A few of the usual suspects spoke out from the Republican side.            “There is no defense for the president’s comments tonight undermining our Democratic process,” said Maryland GOP Gov. Larry Hogan, a frequent Trump critic. “America is counting the votes, and we must respect the results as we always have before.”            Former GOP Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona, another Trump detractor, put the onus on his fellow Republicans to follow suit.            “No Republican should be okay with the President’s statements just now. Unacceptable. Period,” he tweeted.            But there was notable silence from many in the president’s party after his latest address, including from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.            Whether that dynamic will continue if fuller election results deliver the presidency to Biden is another key unanswered question.            If Trump loses his grip on power, that could diminish the incentive for Republicans to continue their sometimes awkward embrace of a president whose provocative pronouncements have so often left them squirming.            Allan Lichtman, a history professor at American University, said previous presidential candidates who have lost elections have accepted their fate with dignity and a respect for American democracy.            He pointed to Nixon’s resignation after Republican colleagues told him that he would be impeached and convicted. He said that Democrat Al Gore gave a courageous speech after the Supreme Court decided his long-in-limbo race would go to George W. Bush.            He called Nixon a “pragmatist” and Trump an “egotist.”            There’s always the possibility that Trump will pull up short at some point and consider the weight of his words — and the impact on his legacy.            If the vote count goes against him, does he really want to be remembered as the president who burned down the building on his way out the door?                     *[FT]: Financial Times

The number of those hospitalized with COVID-19 in Rock County increased to a total of 50 on Thursday, up two more from the previous day and the highest number to date.


  Beloit Health System CEO Tim McKevett urged residents to continue to observe health safety measures during the pandemic.


  “It is imperative that our community adhere to the protocols of wearing masks, practicing social distancing and frequent hand washing to halt the spread of this horrific disease,” McKevett said.


  McKevett said Beloit Memorial Hospital has seen an increase in patients who have had to be admitted due to COVID-19 in the past few weeks. He said the hospital had 14 patients as of this past weekend, but the hospital continues to have capacity for patients. The hospital has about 24 beds available for COVID-19 patients.


  The demand for tests at Beloit Health System’s COVID-19 testing facility remains high with an average of about 100 tests performed a day. Back in October, the facility was performing 40 to 60 tests.


  He also noted that the patients who are showing up at the clinic and hospital are sicker that the patients who came to the health facilities at the beginning of the pandemic. He said it is extremely important for people to see their doctors or seek out medical attention if they think they have COVID-19.


  “The hospital and the clinic are extremely safe. People should not wait to seek medical attention,” he said.


  On Thursday, the Rock County Health Department reported 114 new cases of COVID-19 from the previous day and one additional death in Rock County, bringing the countywide total to 6,091 cases and 48 deaths.


  The health department estimates 50,733 people have tested negative and 3,892 people have recovered. There were 2,151 active cases as of Thursday.


  The positivity rate in Rock County was 29% on Thursday. The statewide seven day positivity rate is 16.4%.


  Dane County reported 17,295 cases and 50 deaths; Green County reported 1,127 cases and 5 deaths; and Walworth County reported 3,830 cases and 39 deaths, Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS) data from Thursday shows.


  Wisconsin reported 5,922 new cases and 38 additional deaths on Thursday, bringing the statewide total to 249,924 cases and 2,194 deaths, DHS reports. As of Thursday, 193,369 people have recovered in the state and DHS believes there are a total of 52,326 active cases in Wisconsin.


  On Thursday, Winnebago County Health Department reported 202 new cases of COVID-19 from the previous day and 3 additional deaths in the county, bringing the countywide total to 12,204 cases and 195 deaths.


  Boone County reported a total of 2,349 cases and 26 deaths; DeKalb County reported 3,027 cases and 43 deaths; McHenry County reported 7,977 cases and 120 deaths; Ogle County reported 1,646 cases and 8 deaths; and Stephenson County reported 1,443 cases and 12 deaths, state data shows.


  On Thursday, the Illinois Department of Public Health reported 9,935 new confirmed cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Illinois, including 97 additional deaths. Currently, IDPH is reporting a total of 447,491 cases, including 10,030 deaths, in 102 counties in Illinois.

Back in March, Sam “The Cooking Guy” Zien was as shocked as anyone when COVID-19 arrived and shuttered his new Graze by Sam restaurant in Little Italy just a few weeks after it opened.


  But with business partner Grain & Grit Collective, the gregarious TV cooking- show host has learned how to adapt and survive in the rocky pandemic-era restaurant world.


  “The word pivot can’t be overused,” Zien said last week. “They say 2020 is the year of the pivot, and if you don’t pivot at all, your life will be a lot more difficult.”


  Graze By Sam has reopened successfully as an all-outdoor restaurant/bar and Zien’s Not Not Tacos stand in Grain & Grit’s Little Italy Food Hall is also now doing “solid” business since the hall reopened for takeout service, he said.


  On Oct. 22, the partners opened their latest collaboration, Eats by Sam, which was tailor-made to ride out the pandemic for as long as necessary. Located in Seaport Village, Eats is essentially two takeout-only restaurant concepts — Samburgers and Samwiches — which sell their products only through third-party delivery apps and a walk-up computer kiosk at Seaport Village. Zien said a third takeout “Sam” brand will likely be added to the Eats mix around February.

UEFA's proposal to change the handball law to prevent unfair decisions damaging the sport will be assessed by world football's rulemaking body, FIFA President Gianni Infantino said in correspondence seen by The Associated Press.


  Responding to a letter from UEFA President Aleksander Ceferin, Infantino said FIFA is striving for "fairness, consistency and transparency" with the on- field regulations that are deliberated over intensely.


  Ceferin had written to Infantino last week seeking a return to the pre-2019 law that allowed referees to judge whether handling was intentional or accidental and prevent the current spate of "many unfair decisions."


  Ceferin was sent a reply after his request to FIFA was obtained by the AP on Thursday, with assurances received that the UEFA suggestion will be discussed by the International Football Association Board meetings later this month.


  "This is not the first time this rule has been the focus of discussion and I believe that it will not be the last time," Infantino wrote to Ceferin. "I for one believe that the intensity of debate over this particular area of the game illustrates well the passion for our sport and the subtleties that make it so compelling."

There are a couple of glimmers of hope for Anderson and the GOP. First, U.S. Senate challenger Daniel Gade ran better than expected against incumbent Mark Warner, the party held on to its seat in the conservative 5th congressional district, and it took two first-term Democratic House incumbents down to the wire (Elaine Luria in the 2nd District and Abigail Spanberger in the 7th).


  Also, the redistricting amendment passed by Virginia voters this week theoretically means the Democrats can’t stack the deck in their favor for the next decade by drawing state and federal districts to their advantage.


  But Anderson and Virginia Republicans will need to do more to reverse a losing streak that’s going into its second decade. Only by redefining what it means to be a Republican can the Grand Old Party recapture Virginia, particularly critical Northern Virginia.


  The GOP needs candidates who better reflect the diversity that is Virginia today, who can relate to suburban voters, and who stand for good government and fiscal responsibility rather than just stand against social issues like abortion and gay rights.


  So it’s a good thing Rich Anderson has lots of energy – he’s going to need it.

We have been blessed with bright planets to easily see in the evening sky (Mars, Saturn and Jupiter) and early morning sky (Venus). Let's try for another you can easily see with a pair of binoculars!      The planet Uranus, one of the gas giants, is seventh in line from the sun. British astronomer Sir William Herschel made history after spotting it in his 6.2-inch, 7-foot-long reflecting telescope, on March 3, 1781. This was the first planet ever discovered since mankind first looked up at the heavens enough times to see that some of the bright points of light were slowly moving, unlike the stars.      He made repeated observations over several weeks and consulted with other astronomers before confirmation was made.      The planet has been detected many times before, but astronomers mistook it for a star.      Uranus is well placed in the evening sky this fall. It is actually bright enough to find with eyes alone, as long as you have a dark, clear sky and dark-adapted eyes. It is shining at magnitude +5.7 and appears like one of many very dim stars.      You need a detailed star chart showing where to find Uranus. Once you think you have it, you can confirm it is Uranus by checking back over the next few nights to see if it has moved.      With binoculars, it is easy as pie. 10x35 binoculars will do fine; 10x50 makes the planet even brighter. If you have a telescope with a mirror or lens at least 3 inches wide, use an eyepiece giving you around 100x and you will share what Sir Herschel must have felt, when you see it as a small disc, unlike any star in the night sky.      It appears to have a somewhat greenish tint in a telescope. Some say bluish. I see it as pea green. Anyway, the color is from the perpetually clouded shroud enveloping Uranus, made up of methane gas. What color do you see?      In the early evening, face east to see the constellation Aries the Ram, and Cetus the Whale. Uranus is right between the "tail" stars of the Whale, which is an easily recognized star pattern on the east side of the constellation. (That's the left side as seen from those of us what I like to say are "Up Over" \- opposite of Down Under - and living in the Northern Hemisphere.)      There are four principal stars of Aries. They make a line that bends down on the west (right) side.      To help you find this region in the sky, Aries is a little over to the right from the glittering, compact Pleiades star cluster, a sight you can't miss. This year, over to the right of Aries, is the bright red planet Mars.      Uranus is very unusual among the planets as it is literally tipped on its side. The axis of rotation, through the planet's north and south poles, is tilted 98 degrees with respect to the planet's orbit. The Earth's axis is tilted 23.5 degrees. It is thought that a major collision knocked the planet over, long, long ago.      At 31,518 miles across, four Earths could fit inside. There are at least 27 moons circling, and 13 extremely faint rings.      Uranus takes 84 Earth years to go around the Sun, which is 1.83 billion miles away, on average.      NASA's intrepid Voyager 2 spacecraft flew by Uranus in 1986.      It may be some time before another space vehicle ventures to Uranus, but with a simple pair of binoculars, you can have a look for yourself the next clear night and let your imagination whirl.      It can make a memory. Like others, I have kept a journal of my astronomical observations. I first located Uranus over 50 years ago, on March 6, 1970, with 7x35 binoculars. I showed the planet to my mother. Uranus was in the constellation Virgo at the time, and has completed more than half of its orbit since then.      The moon is at last quarter on Nov. 8, and new moon is Nov. 15.      Keep looking up at the sky!      Peter Becker is managing editor at The News Eagle in Hawley, Pennsylvania.

His hesitation is strikingly relatable: he’s desperate to do the right thing, even if it means watching relationships crumble away.

Although the plans would undoubtedly turn Shoeburyness into a place worth visiting, it's not what everyone wants.


  The town of Shoeburyness is far less built up than the likes of central Southend-on-Sea down the line, and as a result is far more peaceful.


  It's something that resident Victoria Pallen appreciates.


  During the coronavirus lockdown back in March, 49-year-old Victoria and her partner were both off work for three months.


  In that time, she explored the town she had lived in for 18 years, and liked what she saw.


  "We did a lot of walking around the area, and I've appreciated how village-y it is even more," Victoria said.

  # Couple weds at Orange Park Medical Center where staff saved groom's life from COVID-19


  Beth Reese Cravey


  Florida Times-Union


  When Henry Bell arrived at Orange Park Medical Center on Sept. 13, his case of COVID-19 was so serious he was immediately put on a ventilator.


  Bell, 63, spent weeks in intensive care. His fiancee Antionette Brown, 48, and their respective seven grown children could only wait and hope.


  Eight weeks later, Bell is to go home Friday. But he and Brown, together 14 years and engaged for 12, decided to do something special at the hospital the day before his departure.


  They got married.


  "His condition was deadly," said the bride. "We decided to do it now because we feel they [the hospital staff] are like family and wanted to share the life they gave us back."


  Brown's uncle performed the Thursday-afternoon ceremony outside the hospital's Inpatient Rehab Center, where the groom had begun rehabilitation Sunday.


  His recovery included learning how to walk again.


  In addition to being placed on a ventilator, he had undergone a tracheostomy, a medical procedure that creates an opening in the neck to place a tube into a person's windpipe, allowing air to enter the lungs.


  "It was touch and go for a while," said hospital spokeswoman Carrie Turansky. "After this journey, he and his fiancee didn’t want to wait another minute to get married, and they are so appreciative of the staff … that they wanted to have their wedding here."

Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

There are all these lines that kind of glorify it in the show, like "genius and madness go hand in hand." But I really believe that's true. You know, people whose brains think differently are often wired a little bit differently. And they're often — if you're very emotional, then you're susceptible to certain things, or if you're obsessed with a game, you usually have an addictive personality to go along with it. So, yeah, substance abuse was really common in chess. Especially because a lot of the culture, it being so male-dominated, and also [alcohol] being so much of a lot of individual countries' cultures. Drinking is huge in some tournaments; you can even drink at the board when you're younger and you're around adults who can drink and have, and it's not really an issue. Alcoholism is a big issue for chess players. But also a lot of chess players are on prescribed substances for whatever reason. And so it's really easy to fall into addiction that way. You're playing eight-hour games and then waking up in the morning and doing the same thing. So some people it's just like, you know, self-medication.

UEFA’s proposal to change the handball law to prevent unfair decisions damaging the sport will be assessed by world football’s rulemaking body, FIFA President Gianni Infantino said in correspondence seen by The Associated Press.
 Responding to a letter from UEFA President Aleksander Ceferin, Infantino said FIFA is striving for “fairness, consistency and transparency” with the on- field regulations that are deliberated over intensely.
 Ceferin had written to Infantino last week seeking a return to the pre-2019 law that allowed referees to judge whether handling was intentional or accidental and prevent the current spate of “many unfair decisions."
 Ceferin was sent a reply after his request to FIFA was obtained by the AP on Thursday, with assurances received that the UEFA suggestion will be discussed by the International Football Association Board meetings later this month.
 “This is not the first time this rule has been the focus of discussion and I believe that it will not be the last time,” Infantino wrote to Ceferin. “I for one believe that the intensity of debate over this particular area of the game illustrates well the passion for our sport and the subtleties that make it so compelling.”
 The change to the law from 2019 determined that an offense was committed if players’ arms were outstretched, in an unnatural position, when hit by a ball.

  In fact, Pearson's health was deteriorating just as football was returning for the restart and as he began the final nine games of the season, when Watford were outside the Premier League relegation places on goal difference.


  The Watford players noticed the difference - their usual ebullient, enthusiastic 'Gaffer', whose energy and motivational skills were key to the way he worked - looked exhausted and flat. He spent more time away from the training ground, though he battled on.


  "It wasn't easy for sure, but I dealt with it because I had to," he says. "The other choice was to walk away from the situation. I felt when I was in work, I was still contributing.


  "I missed a couple of press conferences, but there would be a number of people who didn't know what was going on, because when I was in work I was trying to make sure I was going full tilt. When I got home it was a different matter."

I’m usually not the type to bother going for 100% completion in this kind of open-world game, but the sheer joy of exploring _Miles Morales_ New York—looking for hidden baubles and beating up its less-savory characters all the while—will have me exploring every last morsel of Spider content. My one complaint at this point is that there isn’t more of that content—15 hours or so should be enough for a completionist playthrough that I’d be happy extending for much longer (though a New Game + option lets you start over with all your upgrades if you want to work through the game again).

Although by 2005, audiences had grown much more sophisticated and accepting of complex characters and uncomfortable subject matter, Bochco said he still had to fight for his vision of a show with network executives. “It’s always a complicated battle with these people. You have to understand that this is an economically driven medium, and no advertiser wants to be associated with controversy. Because controversy may be interesting and high profile, but it doesn’t necessarily sell soap. That's why _NYPD Blue_ , in its first year, could attract no top-shelf advertiser—no one wanted to touch us with a fork. It was only when the controversy went by the wayside that they all came back on board. It’s first and foremost a commercially and economically driven medium, so you’re always going to have those issues to deal with. The networks are always looking over your shoulder. They do not want you to do anything that’s going to buy them any sort of controversy. Ironically, the easiest time I ever had with them was with _NYPD Blue_ because we had so carefully negotiated the parameters of that show, both in terms of language and in terms of nudity. For over ten years, as long as I stayed within those parameters, there was never anything to argue about. But on every other show I ever did, including the current one, [ _Blind Justice_ ] they’re blue noses, they’re terrible. They are so frightened. They are so conservative. I used to have horrible fights with them when I was younger, and now I just kind of disregard what they say because I don’t have the energy to shriek anymore.”

BEL AIR— Some say beauty is only skin deep, but in Harford County beauty runs deep in several of its residents due to their selfless efforts to help improve the community. Harford County recently recognized some of these individuals as part of the 34th Annual Harford’s Most Beautiful People Awards.


  Award winners include Greg LaCour, who won the 2020 Ripple Effect Award and Shining Light award winners Daniel McGhee and Tom Yingling. The awards also celebrated 11 others who were named as Harford’s Most Beautiful People nominees.


  Harford County Executive Barry Glassman and the Harford County Department of Community Services began recognizing these individuals on Oct. 15 on social media and the county government website in order to share their stories.


  LaCour was nominated by Neala Lancellotti, and was chosen, according to a Harford County press release, for his commitment and advocacy of the Sexual Assault/Spouse Abuse Resource Center for the past 10 years and for his work coordinating the food ministry at Bel Air United Methodist Church.


  In an interview with the Susquehanna Press, LaCour said he felt good about the award, not for himself, but for all of the volunteers who help with the food ministry and other programs. He noted that after receiving the award he went and took photos with many of those behind the scenes people who work to make the community a better place.


  One of those unsung heroes, according to LaCour, is Bryan Kilby of Jones Junction. LaCour said Kilby stepped up and reached out through United Way to help fund the church’s food ministry. LaCour said that Kilby as well as other community members have helped to make the church’s ministry possible, especially during this year, when the outbreak of COVID-19 created difficulties across the county.


  “In the community, Bryan has been a God-send to us,” LaCour said.


  LaCour said the program, as it originally operated, had to switch gears in light of the pandemic and now offers bags of food for those in need through a safe, drive-through operation, where families can drive up and receive food in a COVID safe environment following all of the necessary health and safety protocols.


  “Maryland Food Bank is our primary provider and through this pandemic they have been wonderful,” LaCour said, noting that in addition to food items provided by the Food Bank, other places such as local grocery stores and other businesses have provided food items.


  LaCour also touted local farms, such as Harman’s Farm, who helped the program by providing their extra produce for those in need.


  LaCour said in all there are some 100 volunteers who contribute for the different ministries offered by the church. He notes that in addition to food distribution to families, the last Thursday of the month volunteers work with the Harford County Office on Aging to distribute meals to 260 seniors in Harford County. Throughout the interview LaCour focused on the importance of the volunteers that help push the ministries forward.


  “It is really about them,” LaCour said of the volunteers. “This is really their award.”


  The county also recognized two individuals with the Shining Light Award, an award created by Glassman to recognize citizens who shine a light of awareness on serious issues facing Harford County. McGhee and Yingling were recognized for their commitment to drug prevention and recovery, shining a light on the power of treatment and the elimination of stigma.

The Eats businesses are being operated from the kitchen of the former Buster’s Beach House, an 8,000-square-foot shuttered restaurant at Seaport Village that Zien and Grain & Grit leased earlier this year. Their original plan was to renovate Buster’s and open a new full-service, sit-down restaurant. But that’s not feasible right now. So until the pandemic clouds lift, they’re using the Buster’s space as a ghost kitchen and a commercial commissary for Graze By Sam and Not Not Tacos, which are a mere 1-mile golf cart trip away.


  Samburgers offers five burgers and one hot dog, with a choose-your-protein option and choice of add-on toppings and patties. Zien said the runaway best- seller so far is the Not So Basic Basic Burger.


  Samwiches serves nine sandwiches, including a spicy Soyrizo torpedo, a bacon grilled cheese, a smoked club and a toasted shrimp salad sandwich. Zien’s favorite is the grilled pastrami Reuben, which is topped with cole slaw rather than the traditional sauerkraut. Sides for both Eats concepts include fries, tots, fried pickles, baked beans and three deli salads.


  In the first week of business, Zien said 30 percent of sales were through third-party delivery apps like Grubhub and DoorDash and 70 percent of sales were to walk-up customers at Seaport Village, which has a lot of outdoor seating.


  “Things are going swimmingly,” Zien said. “So far we’ve been embraced. People seem to be excited by what we’re offering.”


  Another thing going well for Zien is the success of his YouTube cooking channel, which has grown from 1.5 million to 2.3 million subscribers since the pandemic began, as more Americans prepare most of their meals at home. That celebrity has helped bring new visitors into his restaurants, which he visits frequently to interact with customers and oversee operations. Zien and his wife, Kelly, live in Little Italy.

I think it's different for everybody. I'm an audio learner, definitely, but a lot of chess players are visual, especially because one of the biggest aspects of chess is space and time and then your position and things. So any chess player that's going to be on any kind of expert professional level has to be able to visualize the board. But for me, I guess it's second nature. It's kind of like translating. For me it feels like, I'm bilingual in Spanish, you know, I'm thinking something in English. Maybe that's my primary language, but then it's easily translated in Spanish. That's kind of the way that it feels with chess for me. Like, OK, I'm sitting and looking at a position, and I see all of these permutations. And the thing that I visualize isn't a totally different, you know, on-the-ceiling board that comes and speaks to me or anything. But it is a similar concept. I just don't think it's so visually apparent to me because it's like second nature.

There are fewer students strolling around Michigan's college campuses this fall.


   


  "I think people are just unsure of what was going to happen," Northern Michigan University President Fritz Erickson told the Free Press recently. Northern Michigan saw its overall enrollment drop 5% this fall from last fall.


   


  Total enrollment in the state's higher education system fell by 3%, a survey of schools by the Detroit Free Press shows. In most admissions offices, the drop is being attributed to the COVID-19 virus because of uncertainty over safety for students, uncertainty of how school would work this semester and the economic impact of people being out of work.


   


  The drop occurred at all levels from the state's biggest public universities to the smallest rural private colleges. In total, the state lost just more than 9,500 students from last year. Seven private colleges contacted by the Free Press for enrollment numbers did not respond, or said that because of how they ran their semesters, the numbers were not yet available.


   


  The drop in students can have a big impact on campuses. At private and public universities, the bulk of a school's revenue comes from student tuition. Lose a significant chunk of students and budgets won't just be sliced, they will have to be diced.


   


  Nationally, undergraduate enrollment is now running 4% below last year's level, and an upward trend for graduate enrollment has slipped to 2.7%, according to the latest data by the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center. As a result, overall postsecondary enrollment is down 3% compared with the same time last year.


   


  "With more data, the downward trends identified in September's First Look report appear steeper, while also emerging for more states and student groups," said Doug Shapiro, executive director of the research center.


   


  "Most strikingly, freshman students are by far the biggest decline of any group from last year, with a decrease of 16.1% nationally and a 22.7% drop at community colleges in particular. First-time students account for 69% of the total drop in undergraduate enrollment."


   


  The public universities


   


  There are 1,800 fewer students taking classes at Eastern Michigan University this fall than there were last year, a drop of about 10%. That ties the drop at Ferris State University, where there are 1,300 fewer students on campus this year than last fall, for the steepest drop of the public universities.


   


  "The fall 2020 enrollment cycle exhibited a high level of uncertainty, particularly amongst our first-time-in-any-college and new transfers," said Kristen Salomonson, Ferris State's dean of enrollment services. "These students were deciding to enroll or not much later than in a typical year. Enrollment results were consistent with the range we predicted based on our ongoing modeling."


   


  The state's largest universities weren't immune. The University of Michigan was flat overall, with gains in undergraduate students, but losses in graduate students, due in large part to a drop in international students.


   


  U-M's application deadlines occurred before the United States reported its first coronavirus death, but by the time students learned whether they were admitted and had to decide whether to enroll, there had been lockdowns and more uncertainty about what school was going to be like in the fall.


   


  "What we're seeing is that many students are choosing to go to school closer to home, which is totally understandable," Erica Sanders, U-M's director of undergraduate admissions said in a statement. "The pandemic and some of the economic hardships that families are facing because of it have been huge factors in students' decisions this year."


   


  At Michigan State University, enrollment is down nearly 900 students from last year -- or 2% -- meaning a projected $54 million drop in revenue, school President Samuel Stanley said in a letter to the campus community. MSU lost 1,165 students in international enrollment and 56 out-of-state students. Out- of-state and international students pay more in tuition than in-state students.


   


  Wayne State and Oakland were also down 2%.


   


  The private universities


   


  As late winter bled into early spring, Albion College admission officials knew families were worried about COVID-19 and what the fall might look like. They sensed some wavering in the students and families that had expressed interest in attending.


   


  "We're small enough of a school that we can be very personal with (prospective) students," said Hernan Bucheli, the school's vice president for enrollment management. "Families in general wanted their students to stay close to home for safety reasons."


   


  So the private school in the middle of southern Michigan reached out to reassure families and also developed the Michigan Promise 2020 to offer free tuition to any family making under $65,000 a year.


   


  They also tried other ways to connect with students and families. For example, if a student signed up for a virtual event at the school, Albion paid for a pizza to be delivered to the student's house. They also sent care packages to some admitted students as part of keeping in touch.


   


  "When you come to Albion, you're going to get this personal attention," Bucheli said.


   


  The plan worked -- the percentage of this fall's freshman class coming from Michigan went up from 69% of the total class to 72%.


   


  And overall enrollment grew as well -- by 2%. That made Albion, along with Adrian, the only private or public college or university to post overall enrollment growth.

BOSTON -- House leaders put forward a $46 billion state budget on Thursday that top Democrats said has no "drastic cuts" or broad-based tax increases, but does rely heavily on one-time funding from the federal government and state reserves to protect services during the ongoing pandemic.


  The House budget, which is usually debated in April, proposes to spend about $188 million more than Gov. Charlie Baker has recommended, in areas like education, food security and substance addiction services. Leaders said they will open debate on the bill on Tuesday, and Speaker Robert DeLeo said he hopes to work with the Senate to deliver a budget for fiscal 2021 to the governor by month's end.


  "This is a budget that pays bills by concentrating on those who are most in need of our help," DeLeo said.


  Like Baker, the House's fiscal 2021 budget assumes a $2 billion reduction in tax revenues from fiscal 2020 due to the pandemic. The House proposes a 5.3% spending increase over the $43.6 billion fiscal '20 budget.


  The House budget includes a section that would restrict courts from finalizing evictions if a tenant has an active application for rental assistance pending with the administration. As a sort of middle ground plan between Gov. Baker and those House Democrats who want to revive the pandemic eviction moratorium, the budget would put $50 million into the Rental Assistance for Families in Transition program.


  Many progressive groups also have been urging the Legislature to consider taxes on wealthy businesses and individuals to avoid cuts to safety net programs during the pandemic, but business leaders have warned that employers bracing for higher minimum wage and unemployment insurance costs next year could choose to leave the state.


  House Ways and Means Chairman Aaron Michlewitz said it was "unthinkable" back in the spring that the House would debate a fiscal 2021 budget that doesn't propose sharp reductions in spending or raise taxes, but the spending plan offered Thursday accomplishes that, in part, by tapping into the state's "rainy day" fund for more than $1.5 billion, or $155 million more than Gov. Baker recommended.


  "I think we tried to create a budget that addressed the immediate needs that we see are important during this COVID world that we're living in, but also didn't burden forever our constituents in this difficult time," Michlewitz said.


  The budget does delay a charitable giving tax deduction that was set to become available for tax year 2021. And the Boston Democrat did not rule out revisiting tax increases in fiscal 2022, planning for which will begin as soon as the budget for fiscal year 2021 is complete.


  The House budget adopted many of the same one-time revenue sources that Baker relied on in his revised budget submission last month, including $550 million in federal CARES Act funding and $834 million in enhanced Medicaid reimbursements for MassHealth. Overall, the proposed budget for fiscal 2021 would use $13.86 billion in federal money, up from $13.23 billion in fiscal 2020.


  For the first time in many years, House leaders are also recommending a substantial withdrawal of $1.5 billion from the state's "rainy day" fund," which would draw down the $3.5 billion reserve by 43% and leave nearly $2 billion for future years. Baker recommended using $1.35 billion from the stabilization fund in his budget plan.


  The Massachusetts Fiscal Alliance, which has argued against tax hikes, said the House's approach would be welcomed if lawmakers had shown more restraint with their spending.


  "Massachusetts taxpayers would be more supportive of seeing their savings being spent if it included at least some belt-tightening by State House leaders," said Paul Craney, spokesman for the group.


  Asked what that meant for earmarks or other policy proposals from legislators, DeLeo said the House must be "careful" to consider the limited resources available, and also mindful that by the time the budget is finished there will be only six months left in the fiscal year.


  House leaders told members to file amendments to the budget by 8 p.m. Friday.
