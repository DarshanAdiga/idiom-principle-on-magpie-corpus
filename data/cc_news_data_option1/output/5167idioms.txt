And it's not just public officials who are being targeted. The Georgia GOP election official who warned earlier this month that someone would wind up getting killed if Republicans didn't speak up outlined instances in which random citizens are getting caught in the crossfire.
 "We have people stalking outside of our elections offices in Cobb County," said Gabriel Sterling last Thursday. "We've had a warehouse manager, he was simply taking trash out to the dumpster, and he had somebody follow him with a camera telling him he's going to prison."
 Hate crimes spiked across the country following Trump's 2017 defense of white supremacists in Charlottesville as "very fine people." But Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University at San Bernardino, told the _Post_ threats targeting government officials increased last year and were then exacerbated by the onset of coronavirus restrictions.
 "The direction of the threats and intimidation against state and local officials took an eerie turn in the last couple of years and accelerated during the pandemic because aggrieved people are interacting with their government at the local level — in public health and elections," Levin said. "And those officials are the very ones labeled as legitimate targets for aggressions on cable news, social media and particularly by the president."
 Following the spate of violent threats, the question becomes who will even want to serve in these positions anymore?
 "There is an ugliness and cruelty in our national rhetoric that is reaching a fevered pitch here at home, and that should worry us all," said Diana Lachiondo, a local Idaho health official who was forced to flee a meeting last week about pandemic restrictions when menacing protesters showed up at her home. Lachiondo, who recently lost reelection, added, "I'm out. ... I've got a light at the end of the tunnel here. But who is going to want to run in the future? Do you need to live in a gated community to feel like you're safe? That is my concern going forward . . . what does this mean for our democracy?"
 One of her colleagues, physician Ted Epperly, agreed the problem isn't going away anytime soon. "I think it'll take a lot of healing, quite frankly, to get us back to working together as a society," he told the _Post_. "I'm sure people will write about this for years to come," he added. "What happened? What happened here in this country? Who are we as people?"

Trump has a loyal base, but loyalty is an easy thing to misplace. The president’s loyalty — and that of other GOP leaders — should be to the Constitution and to the country. And while Trump and many other Republicans across the country say the right things about making sure that every legal vote gets counted — a given as part of the American elections psyche for more than 200 years — their actions have been viewed by many as a power grab to subvert the clear will of American voters and discount hundreds of thousands of legally cast votes for Biden.
 As court after court reiterates whenever the latest lawsuit is dismissed, the challenges are baseless. Trump and his followers have had weeks to find the smoking gun of voter fraud and have failed, with just one minor court victory and more than 50 losses in state and federal courtrooms thus far. Many judges who have dismissed suits are GOP appointees, including many appointed by Trump. Meanwhile, elections officials in various states who did their jobs properly have endured threats of bodily harm from angry Trump supporters.
 No less than U.S. Attorney General William Barr has stated that U.S. attorneys and FBI personnel assigned to investigate specific complaints have not seen any signs of fraud “on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election.” The words of Barr — one of Trump’s staunchest allies — were denounced by the president, and on Monday Barr resigned.
 Last week, Republican U.S. Rep. Dan Newhouse of Sunnyside signed on to an amicus brief supporting efforts by the Texas attorney general to overturn election results in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Georgia. Overall, Newhouse has done a good job representing Central Washington in Congress. He was greatly misguided, however, when he toed the party line and supported the Texas lawsuit, which was bathed in hypocrisy and which the Supreme Court and its conservative majority, including three Trump appointees, quickly dismissed on Friday.
 “Joining this amicus brief is not about trying to overturn the results of an election, but is simply about ensuring the American people have faith in our elections and our Constitution,” Newhouse said in a statement, noting that the four states’ election methods might have been compromised because governors or courts — not the respective Legislatures — made adjustments to the elections process by expanding mail-in voting in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Newhouse was one of 126 GOP members of Congress to sign the amicus brief, along with 17 other attorneys general from states that Trump carried — including several that had their voting procedures altered in similar fashion to those mentioned in the lawsuit. In Texas itself, the governor had made pandemic-related changes to the voting procedure.
 In reality, the actions of Trump and others who refuse to accept Joe Biden’s victory promote the exact opposite of “ensuring the American people have faith in our elections and our Constitution,” despite what Newhouse said.
 Despite all of his losses in the courts, in election recounts, in certified results and in Monday’s Electoral College, Trump as of Tuesday had yet to concede. Enough is enough. Just as Democrats had to get over Hillary Clinton’s loss to Trump four years ago despite winning the popular vote, Republicans have to get over Trump’s loss.

Markets regulator Sebi on Wednesday decided to tweak norms pertaining to 25 per cent minimum public shareholding for companies which undergo corporate insolvency resolution and seek relisting following the process. Besides, it decided to enhance disclosure for such companies, Sebi said in a statement after its board meeting. The move would ensure revival of the corporate debtor pursuant to the resolution plan and provide any listing gains over the next three years to shareholders. Post the Corporate Insolvency and Resolution Process CIRP, such companies will be mandated to have at least 5 per cent public shareholding at the time of their admission to dealing on stock exchange. At present, there is no such minimum requirement. Further, such companies will be provided 12 months to achieve public shareholding of 10 per cent and further 36 months to reach 25 per cent public shareholding. Currently, the norms mandate that in case public holding of such company falls below 10 per cent, then the same will be increased to at least 10 per cent within 18 months and 25 per cent within three years. In addition, Sebi said the lock-in on equity shares allotted to the resolution applicant under the resolution plan will not be applicable to the extent to achieve 10 per cent public shareholding within 12 months. Typically, in view of preferential issuance of shares to the incoming investorpromoter under the resolution plan, such shares would be under lock-in for at least one year. Thus, achieving minimum public shareholding MPS compliance through means involving off-loading of shares by the incoming investor promoter within one year is not possible. Sebi said such companies will be required to make additional disclosures, such as specific details of resolution plan including details of assets post-CIRP and details of securities continuing to be imposed on the companies assets and other material liabilities imposed on the firm. Besides, they need to make disclosure about proposed steps to be taken by the incoming investoracquirer for achieving the minimum public shareholding and quarterly disclosure of the status of achieving the MPS. In August, the Securities and Exchange Board of India Sebi came out with a consultation paper in this regard.

Delhi High Court on Wednesday issued a notice on a petition challenging Centre's notification constituting the Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC) for environmental appraisal of thermal power and coal mining projects.The bench of Justice DN Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan after hearing the submission of petitioner's Advocate Ritwick Dutta, issued notice to the respondents and slated the matter for January 22, 2021.According to the petitioner Manoj Mishra, a retired Indian Forest Services officer, Union of India through Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change on July 10, 2020, reconstituted the EAC for the environmental appraisal of thermal power and coal mining projects under the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) notification, 2006.The notification shows that the government has appointed a total of nine 'non-officials' as members of the EAC and the rest six are officials, the plea said.The plea filed through Advocate Srishti Agnihotri stated that as per the notification, no 'expert' has been appointed despite the mandatory requirement that the EAC should comprise of 'experts'. The EIA notification does not make any reference to 'officials' and 'non-officials', and any such appointment or classification is dehors the statutory scheme. The order states that a total of 15 members have been appointed, of which nine are 'non-officials', which is completely alien to the statutory scheme, the plea further added.It also stated that these appointments fly in the face of several precedents laid down by the Supreme Court of India and the Delhi High Court on the appointment of experts to the EACs/other expert environmental bodies. The notification requires members of the said bodies to be experts having certain educational qualifications and relevant experience in specific fields/disciplines including, inter alia, Environment Quality and Project Management in relevant sectors.The plea added that thus the qualifications for a chairperson are something more than mere expertise. The chairperson must be an 'outstanding and experienced environmental policy expert'.The plea sought the quashing of the notification constituting the EAC and a declaration that the appointments of the respondents are illegal. It also says that the EAC for thermal power and coal mining projects has been improperly constituted vide the notification dated July 10, 2020.The newly appointed chairperson and other members do not meet the prescribed statutory qualifications. Thus, it is imperative that during the pendency of this petition, the EAC does not take any final decision on a thermal power and coal mining project, the plea stated.

The true pleasure in watching Donald Glover evolve as an actor, musician, and cultural critic is anticipating his disruption of expectations. In each manifestation, and with each cultural contribution, Glover deliberately defies intention and probability. As Childish Gambino, the recent release _3.15.20_ is an astute cultural examination of the current political and social situation while also avowing love and humanity. The rollout of _3.15.20_ was a little clunky, first appearing on donaldgloverpresents.com then disappearing only to have a few tracks stream continuously. Regardless of whether this was a tactic to score more attention, the result is perfectly timed.
 As COVID-19 forces individuals into accepting the digital connection and subsequent social disconnect, society is ensconced in the digital realm more than ever. Glover wasn't exactly predicting social distancing, but _3.15.20_ is prophetic in its criticism of the exceedingly blurred overlap between humanity and the digital. A disconnect Glover defines as exasperated by the current health crisis and the underlying oppressive social norms. -- _Elisabeth Woronzoff_

The National Weather Service defines a blizzard as a storm with considerable falling or blowing snow, winds over 35 mph and visibilities of less than 1/4 mile for at least three hours. I remember making it home just before a blizzard showed its nasty side. I was thrilled that the car I called Halftime because it started half the time had gotten me home. Its trunk carried jumper cables and a pair of grain shovels in case I found help after I’d become stuck in the snow. I repeated the mantra “this too shall melt” as I shoveled. If I had a dollar for every time I’d been stuck, I wouldn’t be even moderately rich. Astronomical winter begins Dec. 21, meteorological winter on Dec. 1. My winter begins the day I’ve forgotten how to drive in winter weather. A friend from just down the road owned a tow truck. While I was safe at home and wondering if winter was on its way somewhere or had already been where it was headed, he was out trolling the freeway in blizzard conditions to help stranded motorists, frequently winter visitors who were first thrilled, then chilled.

The title of Staten Island-based instrumental funk group Budos Band's upcoming 15th-anniversary album, _Long in the Tooth_ , is a perhaps obvious but no less satisfying piece of wordplay that speaks to both the group's longevity and style. Evocations of the snake have long been key to Budos releases, fitting visual analogues for the group's serpentine style as they wind back and forth across the borders of retro cinema, golden age Ethiojazz, and psychedelic soul, all with a sinister edge. On _Long in the Tooth_ , we find Budos Band on the attack once more with renewed fervor, fangs truly bared.

Whilst the pandemic has had a huge impact on the refuge, some silver linings have emerged in response to coronavirus restrictions. Although the majority of the refuge’s face-to-face community outreach has ceased for the time being, the support from their dedicated team has been predominantly unaffected. The pandemic has changed the way in which they offer their services, but the fact that victims can be supported remotely – whether that be through WhatsApp, FaceTime, Zoom or via phone – means they can deliver support with fewer time and travel constraints. “Because we cover such a big area, we’re able to spend more time and we’re able to see and speak to more clients,” she said, noting that outreach services have increased during the pandemic.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is considering pushing to have a special counsel appointed to advance a federal tax investigation into the son of President-elect Joe Biden, setting up a potential showdown with incoming acting attorney general Jeffrey Rosen. Trump — angry that out-going Attorney General William Barr didn’t publicly announce the ongoing, two-year investigation into Hunter Biden — has consulted on the matter with White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, White House counsel Pat Cipollone and outside allies. That’s according to several Trump administration officials and Republicans close to the White House who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity to discuss private matters. Beyond appointing a special prosecutor to investigate the younger Biden, the sources said Trump is interested in having another special counsel appointed to look into his own baseless claims of election fraud. But if he’s expecting his newly named acting attorney general to go further than Barr on either matter, he could end up quickly disappointed. Barr on Monday evening announced he will resign effective next week, revealing his plans about a week after Hunter Biden publicly disclosed that he was under investigation related to his finances. It is generally Justice Department policy not to disclose investigations that are in progress, though the subjects of those investigations can. Rosen, the deputy attorney general, will step into the Justice Department’s top job in an acting role. A longtime litigator, he has served as Barr’s top deputy since May 2019 but largely shies away from the spotlight. He said in a statement Tuesday he was “honored” to serve and “will continue to focus on the implementation of the Department’s key priorities.”Trump is still weighing his options, considering whether to pressure Rosen to make the special counsel appointment or, if needed, to replace the acting attorney general with someone more likely to carry out his wishes. He has even asked his team of lawyers, including personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, to look into whether the president has the power to appoint a special counsel himself.A key question will be whether Rosen can stand up to presidential pressure — and potentially withering attacks — in the waning weeks of the Trump administration. If not, Rosen could be cast aside in favor of others more willing to do Trump’s bidding. Believing that a special counsel probe could wound a Biden administration before it even begins, Trump aides have urged the president to push for one, which would make it so the investigation can’t be easily stopped by the incoming president. No firm decision has been made.Trump announced that Barr would be stepping down from his position on Dec. 23, amid lingering tension between the president and the attorney general over the Hunter Biden investigation. Trump was angry for days after learning that Barr knew of the Hunter Biden tax investigation before the election but did not disclose it.He also was unhappy that Barr said in a widely reported interview with the AP that the Justice Department had not uncovered widespread election fraud that would have affected the results of the election. For much of his tenure, Barr was perceived as one of the president’s most loyal Cabinet members, especially after he framed the results of Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation in a manner favorable to Trump even though the special counsel did not exonerate the president of obstruction of justice. It was Barr who first appointed a U.S. attorney to review the case against former national security adviser Michael Flynn and then sought to dismiss the criminal charges against Flynn, who twice pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. As Barr exits, the biggest thing by far hanging over the Trump Justice Department is its investigation into Hunter Biden, which involves multiple U.S. attorney offices and FBI field offices. Appointing a special counsel could prove to be complicated, requiring consolidating different investigatory angles and bringing in someone new to run the probe and get up to speed. Under federal regulations, a special counsel can be fired only by the attorney general and for specific reasons such as misconduct, dereliction of duty or conflict of interest -- reasons that must be spelled out in writing. Appointing a special counsel for the Hunter Biden probe would also signal a more prolonged and complicated investigation than the current inquiry, so far largely centered on his taxes. A subpoena seeking documents from the younger Biden asked for information related to more than two dozen entities, including Ukraine gas company Burisma. Either way, the probe is complicating Joe Biden’s pick for attorney general, upon whose shoulders this probe would land. Any nominee for attorney general is likely to face a mountain of questions at a confirmation hearing about how they would oversee the probe. It could be that Rosen is left in the position for a few weeks after Biden is sworn in on Jan. 20. If Trump doesn’t fire him, that is.Rosen has been the public face of some of the Justice Department’s biggest actions, including its antitrust case against Google and the criminal case against opioid maker Purdue Pharma. Before joining the Justice Department, he worked at the Department of Transportation as general counsel and then deputy secretary.At Rosen’s confirmation hearing in 2019, he suggested that he was willing to rebuff political pressure from the White House, if necessary. He told legislators that criminal investigations should “proceed on the facts and the law” and that prosecutions should be “free of improper political influences.”“If the appropriate answer is to say no to somebody, then I will say no,” he said at the time.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

 # I'm Hamp Fay. Here's why I'm signing with Michigan State football
 Hampton Fay
 Special to Detroit Free Press
 View Comments
 _Hampton Fay is a 6-foot-5, 210-pound quarterback at All Saints' Episcopal School in Fort Wort, Texas. He has committed to play football at Michigan State and is expected to sign with the Spartans on Wednesday, the first day of the early signing period. This is his story: _
 Answered prayer.
 I don’t know how else to explain how I ended up choosing Michigan State football, other than God listening to my heart and providing a clear picture.
 In 2019, I made a difficult decision to leave Aledo High School, where I played wide receiver, following our school’s eighth Texas football state championship. Until that year, I had always played quarterback and loved the position, but knowing I needed to get actual work in at QB, if I wanted an opportunity to play the position after high school, I enrolled at All Saints’ Episcopal School for my junior season. Our team started strong that fall, winning our first three games; but as luck would have it, on the day I received my first scholarship offer from the University of Illinois, I hurt my shoulder at the end of that game. I quickly found myself watching the remainder of our season from the sideline with a repaired shoulder.
 Nonetheless, those three games gave me great confidence in what was to come. I would have to pass on other sports that spring and summer, and rehabbing my shoulder became my priority. I wouldn’t get “camp exposure,” but frankly, while I think it serves a purpose, I’ve always valued winning ball games as the great talent evaluator. By March, I had received several offers to play football. Intending to “unofficially” visit all of those schools — before COVID-19 turned our world upside down — I visited Indiana and Michigan State during spring break. MSU’s beautiful campus, top-notch facilities, student- body passion ... it all proved to be incredibly impactful.
 In January, I was introduced to Coach Mel Tucker and offensive coordinator Jay Johnson and was impressed with their attention to detail on many levels. Immediately, I found them to be very committed to WINNING football games and devoted to the toughness, discipline, work ethic and character required to be successful. (Throughout my brief high school career, I have always enjoyed the grind and valued the benefits from tough work drawing near to my teammates in the pursuit of success.) My visit to East Lansing, and interaction with the staff and locals cemented my desire to join this family atmosphere of hard workers.
 After researching the school’s tradition and excellence in education, I found common ground and envisioned myself wearing the green and white. In May, after comparing every top football program —including those that had no interest in me — to MSU’s, I found peace in committing to Coach Tucker and the Spartan family — a commitment I’ve never questioned.
 My senior season was deeply affected by COVID-19 interruptions, and we lost our semi-final playoff game, but I’m honored to have won with this decision and opportunity. See you in January! Go Green!!!

West Brom are looking for a new manager following the departure of Slaven Bilic. Here, we look at some possible contenders for the vacancy at The Hawthorns.It might seem a stretch to expect Gerrard, 40, to quit a strong title challenge in Scotland for a relegation battle in England, but his name being mentioned underlines the growing reputation he has. Expected to move back to the Premier League at some point but the route to his dream job of managing Liverpool looks unlikely to open up any time soon. Former England and Chelsea captain Terry is expected to step up to a top job sooner or later after two years working as assistant boss to Dean Smith at Aston Villa. The 40-year-old, who won multiple honours during his illustrious playing career, has also been linked with other posts including Derby and Bournemouth.Long regarded as one of the brightest young managerial prospects in English football, the 43-year-old is available after leaving Bournemouth in the summer. Led the Cherries through the divisions to the top flight - after first keeping them in the English Football League - and then oversaw a five- year stay in the Premier League. The Portuguese would be a gamble after failing in three previous attempts to establish himself in England. He cut a particularly forlorn figure as he was dumped by Everton after a dreadful run in December 2019 that left the Toffees in the relegation zone. Silva, 43, made positive initial impressions at Hull, Watford and Goodison Park but all three reigns proved inglorious and short-lived. The former Leeds and Newcastle midfielder may be ready to step up to the Premier League after cutting his managerial teeth with Charlton. The 43-year-old proved his worth by overcoming the club's off-field difficulties to secure promotion to the Championship in 2019. They were relegated last term but are back among the leading League One contenders. Remains a contender for top English jobs despite his recent sacking by Nice. The 44-year-old World Cup-winning former Arsenal linchpin made a good impression in two-and-a-half years with the French club, overseeing seventh and fifth-placed finishes and European qualification, before paying the price for a poor start in 2020-21. Previously in charge of Manchester City's elite development squad and sister club New York City. A name typically linked with fire-fighting jobs, Allardyce is likely to be mentioned despite apparently being retired. Has previously taken on Crystal Palace and Everton as short-term rescue projects. England manager for a brief time, the 66-year-old would not come cheap but he has a strong reputation forged with solid spells at Bolton, Blackburn and West Ham.
