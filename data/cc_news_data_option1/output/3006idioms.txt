Star West Coast defender Jeremy McGovern will miss at least another week, while midfielder Jack Redden has also been ruled out of the Eagles' clash with Geelong at Optus Stadium.
 McGovern was a late withdrawal from last week's win over Collingwood after breaking his right thumb against Fremantle and coach Adam Simpson said the four-time All-Australian wasn't ready to return.
 "The thumb is just giving him a bit of grief at the moment," Simpson said.
 "It hasn't got worse, it's got better, but just not to the point where he can play.
 "We tested it out today, and we'll err on the side of caution with that one.
 "We'll have to wait and see (whether he can play next week).
 "We'll give it as much time as it needs to. He hasn't had a setback, it's just in a difficult spot. It's just going to take a little bit of time."
 Redden pulled up sore in his quad after the win over Collingwood and has been put on ice for this week.
 Simpson confirmed 19-year-old rookie defender Harry Edwards would make his debut.
 "These tall defenders take a little bit of time to develop. He's pretty raw," Simpson said.
 "I reckon he might have grown around 20cm in the last two years. He came to the club as a utility, and he's about 200cm tall now."
 West Coast shot into premiership favouritism following their 66-point demolition of Collingwood.
 But Simpson was doing his best to take the underdog tag against the fourth- placed Cats, who are above the Eagles only on percentage.
 West Coast, who lost to Geelong by 20 points in last year's semi-final, enter Saturday's match as hot favourites.
 "We've been building for a few weeks, and I think we're now in a position where hopefully we've got a brand that can compete against anyone in the competition," Simpson said.
 "But Geelong are above us on the ladder, they're the form team really when you look at it. Their numbers stack right up across the board.
 "We've had a good week, they've had a good season, so we know where we sit."
 The Cats will be without skipper Joel Selwood (hamstring) for another week, while they are still without a recognised ruckman, meaning Eagles big man Nic Naitanui has the perfect chance to continue his stunning form.
 Saturday's match will also see Eagles midfielder Tim Kelly come up against his former side for the first time.
 Kelly played his best game for the Eagles last week when he tallied 29 disposals, six clearances and a goal.

If college football somehow makes it to the field, all we’ll get is a shell of a season. Fewer games. Conference bubbles. A limited number of fans in the stadiums — or maybe none at all. Is it really worth risking the health of players, coaches and boosters for this? The mighty Southeastern Conference, which has produced 10 of the last 14 national champions, delivered the grimmest signal Thursday that this will be a season like no other, if there’s actually a season amid a raging pandemic that shows no signs of fading away. Following drastic moves already instituted by the Big Ten, Pac-12 and Atlantic Coast Conference, the SEC announced a 10-game, conference-only schedule that won’t begin until late September. The Big 12 will likely have to follow suit, despite making an aggressive push to play a full, 12-game schedule even as the pool of potential non-league opponents dries up. The reduced, bubble-like schedules are effectively a Hail Mary to save a season that, frankly, may not be worth saving at this point. “We’re all hoping,” was the best Georgia athletic director Greg McGarity could offer, and even then he was quick to add a sobering dose of reality. He reminded everyone of the Miami Marlins, who were struck with a coronavirus outbreak just days into a baseball season that already had been delayed by nearly four months. “No one in college football has even practiced yet,” McGarity said, as though he was already preparing everyone for a fall without college football. “This is just a date. It’s a date we’re holding. I sure hope we start then. But as we’ve seen with professional sports already, this thing can change on a dime.\" No sport faces more daunting odds to pull off a season that is relatively free of the highly contagious virus....

Stillman Valley's five-time state champion coach Mike Lalor never had to draw up a scheme trying to deal with Byron's Troy Drake.
   
 Worse, he had to do it himself.
   
 Lalor lined up head-to-head with Drake on both sides of the ball when Woodstock Marian edged Byron 23-21 in the second round of the playoffs. That was Marian's only playoff game closer than 12 points en route to the 1982 Class 2A state title.
   
 "For that time period, his size was monstrous," Lalor, who played guard and defensive tackle, said of the 6-foot-8 Drake, who would go on to start on the defensive line for Indiana in the Big Ten and at offensive tackle for Washington in the NFL. "We hung on to win the game, but I don't know if my back has ever felt right since then.
   
 "He was maybe a touch better on defense. He had such a wingspan at 6-8. You could have him blocked decently, but he could still reach out and cover a lot of ground."
   
 "Troy was equally as good on either side of the ball. When he blocked, he just drove people," said former Byron coach Everett Stine, who called that 23-21 loss to Marian "one of the greatest high school football games I ever coached."
   
 Drake, our pick as the 10th-greatest football player in Rockford-area history, was almost as good in basketball as he was in football. He was also a good first baseman in baseball before deciding to run track as a senior under Stine, who also coached that sport at Byron.
   
 "He went out for track as a senior to help with his running," Stine said. "We made him a 400 runner and discus thrower. He started out running the 400 in 67 seconds. By the end of the year, he made finals in the district meet and ran 52 seconds. At that time, he weighed 260.
   
 "He also made the finals in the discus. The ring was too small for him. If he had thrown the discus four years in high school, he would have been right there with the best."
   
 Drake's athleticism almost led him to choose a basketball career. Before college, that was his favorite sport. And he had Division I college offers in basketball. Just not as good as the ones he had for football.
   
 "If I decided to play Division I basketball, I would have had to go to the Naval Academy or Fresno State," he said. "I would have had to leave the Big Ten, and the Big Ten is where my heart was. That's why I changed direction and went to football."
   
 Still, he also changed his football direction at Indiana. He played on both the offensive and defensive lines in high school.
   
 "I also snapped for extra points," he said. "Kickoffs and kickoff returns were the only two plays I came off the field. I loved it."
   
 In high school, Drake was "still a little clumsy," according to Stine, still adjusting to his huge growth spurt.
   
 At Indiana, he was one of the most athletic linemen in the Hoosiers' 1983 recruiting class.
   
 "They recruited eight linemen and the way they did it at Indiana is all of them started on defense," Stine said. "The three best they kept on defense. The rest they moved to offense. So Troy played defensive tackle."
   
 All those basketball seasons helped Drake be an athletic lineman in football.
   
 "It's completely comparable to what you have to do in football," Drake said. "You have to be able to move your body around, have hand-eye coordination and see the court. It's like being on the line and trying to figure out what is happening in front of you."
   
 Drake, a two-year starter at Indiana, was eager to play defense.
   
 "That was my desire. That was where I wanted to be," he said.
   
 "And throughout my career at Indiana, I was playing with and against guys in the Big Ten that were getting chances in the NFL. I knew I'd get an opportunity, too.
   
 "But I didn't know the opportunity was going to come as an offensive lineman."
   
 Drake bulked up to 285 pounds by the time he left Indiana. That still wasn't big enough to be an NFL offensive lineman. And he wasn't quite athletic enough to play defensive line in the pros, but several teams wanted to try him on offense as an undrafted free agent.
   
 "I was happy to be an offensive lineman if that is what they thought I would be most successful at," Drake said.
   
 He picked the Philadelphia Eagles, mostly because Bill Callahan coached their offensive.
   
 Callahan was the head coach of the Oakland Raiders for two years, leading them to the Super Bowl in his first season in 2002. He is currently the offensive line coach of the Cleveland Browns and knew Drake because he tried to recruit him to Wisconsin when Callahan coached the Badgers' offensive line.
   
 "Bill told me I should have been playing offensive line in college," Drake said. "I went with him so he could mold and create and get me in position to play. We had a previous relationship, and I played defensive line against his offensive linemen for four years. We had a real good bond. That gave me an opportunity. As an undrafted free agent, that's all you want; an opportunity to make a name for yourself."
   
 It took time. First, Drake had to bulk up, eventually growing from 285 pounds to 330. He also had to learn a new mentality as a blocker instead of a tackler.
   
 "It was tough; everything on the defensive line is attack forward, attack forward and go after the ball," Drake said. "On the offensive side, it's all about positioning. It's a lot different. The skill set of hand work and foot placement and the steps you have to retrain and work on, all of that stuff was heavily needed for me. Especially early on. I spent a lot of time on the field with Bill and the other guys training to be an offensive linemen and taking that defensive mentality out of my skills."
   
 By the time he was ready, Drake moved on. After three years as a backup or on the taxi squad with the Eagles, he signed as a free agent with Washington.
   
 "They were in need of some offensive tackles," Drake said. "There was open competition for the position."
   
 Drake worked his way into the lineup and became a starting NFL offensive tackle for the first time midway through the 1998 season. But he tore his ACL in November and was finished. He officially retired in 2000 but still lives with his wife and two kids in Ashburn, Virginia, home of Washington's NFL training facilities. His daughter, Abbey, is a senior in high school and his son, Dawson, is the student manager of Indiana's football team.
   
 "It's unfortunate the game is that way," Drake said of injuries and the NFL. "I was out of football for 18 months. I had surgery in the beginning of December and all through the 1999 season I was still rehabbing. Even after the season, I still wasn't medically cleared to play.
   
 "When I finally got medically cleared in the offseason, I made the determination that if I was not on a team for the start of the 2000 season, I was going to retire. Nothing panned out, so I put in my retirement papers and moved on. It was a tough decision, but it was time to move on."
   
 Drake's name still lives on in Byron. His jersey, along with the Philadelphia Eagles jersey of Sean Considine, Byron's only other NFL player, hangs above the bar in the restaurant area of Byron's PrairieView Golf Course.
   
 "That's pretty neat," Drake said. "It's amazing that Sean and myself were two kids from Byron that got to play in the Big Ten and make it into the NFL."

Right now, no one can — with 100 percent certainty — say schools will even open for in-person instruction, so it’s time to pump the breaks on extra- curricular activities.
 Football teams are scheduled to begin heat acclimatization on Aug. 10. A week later all fall sports — boys and girls soccer, cross country, golf, field hockey and girls tennis — can begin practice with games scheduled to start in late August or early September.
 It just feels like it’s too soon.
 We want sports to be back as much as all of you do. The Daily Item sports reporters want to be back covering our teams, our kids. There is something special about a town rallying around a sports team, it’s a tie that can bind generations, too.
 Last week, the association that oversees scholastic sports in California pushed back the start of sports until at least December with games likely not to begin until January. They will then combine winter and spring sports into the season. A similar time frame will be in place in Virginia with winter sports running from December to February, fall sports from March through May and spring sports from late April until June.
 No one knows if those plans will work either, but they buy time. Right now, that means a lot.

 "We received a tremendous amount of positive feedback on him from staff, administration and community members," Trojan said. "We realize there are going to be some tough challenges getting the (Advanced Technology Center) up and running, but I think he'll work hard to make that successful."
   
 The Advanced Technology Center, which the college is in the process of building in partnership with the Belvidere School District, will serve as a regional hub for post-secondary education in manufacturing and technology.
   
 Trojan said the board also was impressed with Spearman's community engagement and believes his outreach efforts will help the college build partnerships throughout the region.
   
 Madison College, where Spearman is employed, is one of 16 technical colleges in the Wisconsin Technical College system, which serves 33,000 students.
   
 Spearman previously served as vice president of student affairs at Rock Valley and remains a Rockford-area resident.
   
 "I'm excited about being the next president at RVC," Spearman said. "It's a great opportunity to engage the community and lead the campus' efforts. It's a great time to reconnect with the campus and the staff, faculty and students."
   
 Spearman said his top priority is student success.
   
 "I know these are tough times regarding COVID-19 and social unrest, but I believe people want to see a leader that they can trust. ... I believe I am that person," he said.
   
 "I believe they selected me for what I bring to the table and my talents; however, I also acknowledge that I am the first African American president, and I don't mind being the first."
   
 The other finalist was Amy King, who recently served as the central region group president for DeVry University.
   
 Beth Young, the college's chief operating officer, has been serving as interim president since April 28 when the college's former president Doug Jensen resigned to take job at Bismarck State College in North Dakota.
   
 Rock Valley College was founded in 1964. Jensen was the college's seventh president.
   
 Hiring its first Black president in 56 years is a good move by RVC, said Tony Turner, a former Rock Valley student and former president of the Black Student Union. He's also the founder of the city's All Black Graduation event, which debuted in 2019.
   
 "It's a good look and a good decision by Rock Valley College," Turner said. "Now is a time for change. One of Rock Valley's goals is to encourage more African American students.
   
 "We've been talking about creating diversity on campus, and what better way to create diversity than the president."

I remember swearing to myself that I would NEVER do a long distance relationship again. I thought it was just impossible and then 2 years ago…..you walked into my life. Time went on and I started to panic, realising I was head over heels and in love with a person who was going to stay away for a while. As hard as it may be sometimes, our decision was totally worth it. My heart was only strong enough for you ???? You keep me on my toes, put up with me (I also put up with you, don't know which is worse) and make me want to be the best version of me that I can be. The universe really does work wonders ????

"These enhancements to PPE are a direct response to the increasing number of incidents of violent and aggressive behaviour from patients and visitors against our staff.
 "Since introducing CCTV we have seen a marked reduction in incidents that escalate to violent and aggressive behaviour.
 "Both of these introductions are becoming best practice for all those who work in a security function across most industries and organisations."
 Nottinghamshire Police have also got on board with a new office in the emergency department, providing further security and support to the staff working in areas of increased risk.
 Red Watch is requested when a patient is displaying violent and aggressive behaviour or poses a danger to themselves and others.
 The most recent collection of data is for March 2019, when security staff spent 298 hours dealing with these types of patients.
 This is an increase from February where they spent 242 hours dealing with 'red watch' incidents.
 The report states: "The increase in security response and incidents of violent and aggressive behaviour have been discussed with our police partners and both parties agreed this is due to the increase of synthetic drug use and associated criminal activity in the Nottinghamshire area."
 Synthetic dugs include substances such as synthetic cannabinoids, commonly known as mamba.

ROCKFORD - Sports fans were so desperate for anything related to athletics during the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic that seemingly the entire nation came together in April to watch the ESPN documentary series "The Last Dance" about the Chicago Bulls' final championship season in 1997-1998.
   
 When Stuart Walker, the Rockford area's 11th greatest football player of the past 75 years, talks about his East E-Rabs teams, it reminds you of one of Michael Jordan's better quotes about success.
   
 "Talent wins games, but teamwork and intelligence wins championships," Jordan has said.
   
 "We could could watch (game) film whenever we wanted," Walker said of those E-Rabs, who went 22-0 over his junior and senior seasons and rolled to the IHSA Class 4A state title in the first year of the state playoffs. "We studied film. There was an expectation at East. We'd study it in between classes.
   
 "I have to give it to (defensive coach Jerry) Stalcup and (head coach Bob) Pellant. Our opponents were so well scouted that we usually knew what a team was running as soon as they lined up.
   
 "When you had the talent we had, with six or seven guys going on to play big time football … I felt sorry for the other teams. They had no chance."
   
 Those E-Rab teams featured three players who would play college football in the Big 10 in Russell Pope (Purdue) and Ira Matthews and George Wojtowicz (Wisconsin) and another who would make his school's Hall of Fame in Division II in Jerry Holloway at Western Illinois. Walker would excel at the University of Colorado.
   
 In an earlier story in this series, Holloway detailed how this great collection of talent only came together because Rockford Public Schools redrew its boundaries after converting Jefferson into a high school. Most of East's star talent would have gone to West under the old boundaries.
   
 "Man, did you see 'Remember the Titans?'" Walker asked about the 2000 movie detailing how football players from an all-black high school came together with players from an all-white high school in Virginia in 1971. "It wasn't always smooth. We'd grown up thinking we'd be Warriors. Plus, you have to look at the times. You had the Civil Rights movement. You had Vietnam going on. The talk wasn't always football. A lot of times it was about getting drafted to go to Vietnam."
   
 Of East's major stars, Walker was the only specialist who didn't play offense and defense.
   
 "I was a stand-up linebacker. They tried to get me to play offensive line, but I didn't want to do that," Walker said. "What I did like to do was play special teams. I'd tell Ira (Matthews), 'just follow me around the right side.' Ira returned so many kicks for touchdowns … until they started just kicking the ball out of bounds."
   
 Of the 22 wins, the team's 1973 season-opening win over Freeport was the one Walker remembers best. That Pretzels team featured future Freeport coach Cal Cummins, who would go on to star at Iowa State, Dave Babcock, Jim Spangler and Jim Spielman (all at Eastern Illinois), Jim Ludeking at NIU, Steve Kaiser at Dartmouth and Iowa basketball player Tom Norman.
   
 "It was in Freeport and they had a bunch of seniors. No one expected us to win that game," Walker said. The Pretzels led 14-13 at halftime.
   
 "I never talked much, but that's the one time I said something. I stood up and told the coaches we needed to give the ball to Ira."
   
 In the second half, Matthews, who would go on to play three years in the NFL for the Oakland Raiders, would score on touchdown runs of 31 and 10 yards and then cap it off with a 61-yard touchdown reception in a 33-21 win. It was Freeport's only loss of the year.
   
 "After that, I don't want to say it was easy, but we never worried about losing," Walker said.
   
 Although the E-Rabs mostly remain close today, there were factions. Pope and Holloway grew up in the same neighborhood. Walker grew up near Matthews.
   
 Walker and Matthews, who were the two E-Rabs named to the Champaign News- Gazette all-state football team in 1974, planned to stick together in college. But about 30 minutes before they were scheduled to sign their letters-of- intent for scholarships, Walker told Matthews he'd be going to Colorado instead of Wisconsin.
   
 "Me and Ira, we were visiting colleges every weekend," Walker said of the decision. "I was a pretty headstrong cat. My hero was Muhammad Ali. I wanted to try something new. We were invited to Colorado. I remember flying to Denver on Feb. 7, 1974. It was like 10 degrees in Rockford. We get to Denver and go over this valley and see Boulder. It was 65 degrees and you had mountains in the background. I said to Ira, 'This is the place for me.'"
   
 Walker was a three-year starter at Colorado. He had 159 total tackles, including 24 for losses and 12 sacks. The Buffaloes went 21-12-1 during those seasons and played in the 1977 Orange Bowl.
   
 "That was grown-man football," Walker said. "We played Oklahoma, Nebraska, Oklahoma State, Iowa State. I went up against Kellen Winslow at Missouri. He was the real deal."
   
 In 1979, Walker was one of three former E-Rabs drafted by NFL teams. The Atlanta Falcons took him in the 12th round despite the fact he skipped Colorado's pro day workout for scouts because he was taking a final exam.
   
 "I expected to go the free-agent route so I was a little surprised when I saw my name called," Walker said. "'When you're a low pick, you get pegged early on. I was able to stick for a year, but it was frustrating. I'd get signed to the taxi squad, get cut, taxi squad, get cut.
   
 "I talked to a lot of the vets who had been trying to stick in the league for three or four years and … I was done after that season," Walker said. "I had other things to do. Pro football wasn't the end-all for me. I'd had some shoulder surgeries so I wanted to get healthy and see what life held for me."
   
 Walker went back to Colorado and started working with Continental Airlines and stayed in the industry for more than 30 years through a bunch of mergers and buyouts. Now, he is retired and splits his time between Florida and Colorado.
   
 "You know, my problem was I could never gain weight. I would start a season at 220 pounds and I'd be 198 by the end of it," Walker said. "A couple of years after I stopped playing, the weight suddenly showed up and now I can't get below 240."
   
 He still has a special bond with his former East teammates.
   
 "When Ira won the Super Bowl (with the Oakland Raiders in 1981) it felt like we won it," Walker said. "We still talk all the time. We did some special stuff."

A South Australian paramedic who went to Victoria to help test people for coronavirus has herself tested positive for the infection.
 The woman in her 20s volunteered to help with testing operations in Melbourne associated with the current surge in cases there.
 She returned to Adelaide on Wednesday and is now in isolation along with one close contact.
 Other health officials who went to Melbourne as part of the same team have all tested negative so far.
 Chief Public Health Officer Nicola Spurrier said the woman had followed all the proper procedures with protective equipment but an infection in such circumstances was "part of the risk of this sort of work".
 "She absolutely followed the correct infection control processes," Professor Spurrier said on Friday.
 "But this is risky business."
 It was also revealed that 170 people were expected to arrive in Adelaide on Saturday on a repatriation flight from India.
 All will go into hotel quarantine with officials expecting at least some to have COVID-19.
 At the same time, Police Commissioner Grant Stevens rejected calls from the state opposition to check every car and truck coming into SA from Victoria and conduct mandatory border testing.
 Mr Stevens said regardless of the resources available, stopping every truck would cause significant delays with road freight and create significant road safety issues.
 The commissioner also expressed disappointment over the good behaviour bond imposed on a 65-year-old Mt Gambier woman who snuck back into SA from Victoria by hiding in a truck on Tuesday night.
 She appeared in court on Friday and pleaded guilty to failing to comply with a direction.
 The 46-year-old driver of the truck was also arrested in Adelaide and charged with failing to comply with a direction and was expected to appear in court on Monday.
 Mr Stevens said the general sentiment in the community towards those who breached the state's border rules was "one of disgust".
 "People recognise we have a significant concern right on our doorstep with Victoria in the current state it's in and we're doing as much as we can to protect the South Australian community," he said.
 "People who breach these directions are putting other people at risk and they're making a mockery of the efforts of everybody in the community to work through this COVID-19 situation."
 Premier Steven Marshall said in light of the dangerous situation in Victoria and the clusters of cases in NSW, SA would not change its current border rules.
 Under the current provisions, only essential travellers are allowed to enter SA from Victoria.
 But people can come from NSW and the ACT provided they quarantine for 14 days.
 The new coronavirus infection in SA on Friday takes the total number of cases diagnosed in SA since the start of the pandemic to 450 but only three of those are considered active infections.

"My house mate's bike is only a 2020 model and it's worth about £1,400. It's hard to put a price on mine because it's custom made.
 "I've had my bike for four or five years and I've built it from the frame up, the wheels are custom, the handlebars are custom. Apart from the frame, it's all custom.
 "The bikes are fairly unique and they're bright orange and they must have made a bit of noise breaking the door through."
 The thieves also caused thousands of pounds worth of damage to Connor's show car denting the bonnet.
 He said: "When I bought the car, it was bog standard but I've spent quite a bit of money building it up.
 "I paid £1,500 to have it wrapped cream at the beginning of the year and that money has gone down the drain as they have destroyed the wrap so it will need to be re-done.
