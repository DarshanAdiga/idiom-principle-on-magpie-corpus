Essentially, Raju and others used this fake financial strength to raise more money which they used for large real estate purchases. During the boom, they had apparently become obsessed with land development on a gigantic scale. As the 2008 financial collapse accelerated and the land business unravelled, they found it impossible to maintain the illusion and had to come clean. Of course, none of this would have been possible without the involvement of the auditors, but that's a separate story.

It happened to work out well with the regional hosting site as well— after last year’s fan support and moderate on-court success from Best Virginia, a WVU alumni team, they re-entered the field in 2020 and were granted the chance to host a regional bracket from the Charleston Civic Center.
 With the MEC being centered in the state and most players either in West Virginia or bordering state, it was easy to get the team organized and establish an opportunity to qualify for the regional — the proximity of the team to the region and their West Virginia roots fit perfectly.
 But to ensure that they’re playing alongside Best Virginia and others from July 24-26 — which is when the Charleston regional bracket is set to take place — the team must earn their place. While Morris believes from speaking with his former collaborators at the TBT that they have a pretty good chance at being on the court, to make it a lock, they need to garner a buzz online to prove they’ll provide fan support and rating when the tourney comes to town.
 “They base it off of fanbase, off of player quality, your sponsors — you have to be reliable for the region, for the hotel stay and travel for that level of the tournament. It helps to have a celebrity or someone intriguing backing your team like Chris Paul had his team last year,” Morris said.
 “One good thing we have is that we don’t just have one fanbase — we have teams all over West Virginia and Ohio, and I think that will be an awesome opportunity for us. Its very important the different fan bases come out for us — it will be important for us to grab all those alums and help us get over the top and be one of the best teams in this region,” team general manager Warren Doles said.

Did you know that Warren Buffett, one of the richest people in the world, still lives in the same house he bought in 1958? Purchased for $31,500 (which is equivalent to a price of at least $250,000 in today’s dollars.) It’s now worth at least $650,000. Buffett calls it the “third best investment I ever made.” Certainly Warren Buffett could afford a newer house. When asked why he doesn’t move? He says he’s happy there, and would move if he thought he could be happier somewhere else.
 You hear often about a person who dies and leaves millions to a nonprofit or an educational institution. And people are surprised, as no one had a clue that this person had that kind of money. Why are they surprised? Because the person lived below their means.
 Instead of upsizing their home, like Warren Buffett, they stayed put. They were proud to drive an older car when they could have easily afforded to get one with fewer dings and more bells and whistles. They could, but didn’t.

 Budgets are good things. They require us to think about the money coming in and the money going out. They force us to rethink our choices, especially when the outflow is greater than the inflow.
 What’s most important? We have things we have to pay for, such as housing, utilities and food. And there are things we want, such as restaurant meals, vacations and clothing.

Fredericksburg’s School Board has revised its current and upcoming budgets in light of revenue shortfalls caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Board members voted unanimously during a virtual meeting last week to approve both a $500,000 reduction in the city’s contributions for the $47.5 million operating budget for this fiscal year and an updated budget for fiscal year 2021, which begins July 1, that has nearly $1.85 million less in city funding than originally planned.
 The school system also incurred unexpected expenses for technology and payroll as it switched to online learning due to COVID-19, but those will be offset by the approximately $801,500 in CARES Act stimulus funds available for use through 2022 for expenses related to the pandemic. It was also able to save on some expenses such as supplies, travel and utilities because schools were closed, according to a memo from Director of Finance Jennifer Brody to the School Board.

It was a sensitive message from an actor that put the spotlight on the plight of animals still locked in cages in shops that sell animals as pets. In the lockdown period, shop owners had left without caring for the animals inside. Local good samaritans and animal welfare groups had to rescue them. The worry is that more shops with captive starving animals may be shut to this day, unknown to authorities or welfare organisations.
 The Covid-linked lockdown has revealed why the use and sale of animals as pets and circus animals, for example, needs to be stopped. The very source of the coronavirus is being linked to China’s wet markets where wild animals are sold for meat — a practice criticised globally, forcing China to take some measures to curb it. Another Covid revelation is the abandoning of pets by uncaring owners, apparently for fear of getting infected by them. This, despite the World Health Organization clarifying, repeatedly, that there was no truth in this view. If anything, humans transmit Covid to their pets. The distressing reality of locked-up animals and abandoned pets led People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) to write to the Director Generals of Police across the country to book people abandoning their pets and take action against shops leaving captive animals to starve.
 Animals in circuses also suffer, says animal rights organisation FIAPO, citing reports of owners choosing between the welfare of its staff versus animals. The organisation called for the animals to be released to caring shelters. For all the videos of animals reclaiming their space during the lockdown, its also true is that a German zoo reportedly had a “slaughter list” of animals to be fed to others because of the financial crisis. As the lockdown lifts for humans, so should it for animals captive in shops, circuses or zoos. Let them run free in their habitats.

 "Resiliency is the hallmark of being a small business entrepreneur," said Loren Remillard, president and CEO of the Winnipeg Chamber of Commerce. "We're seeing huge numbers of small retailers and others make that transition and doing so successfully."
 All of this, however, will be for naught if we do not maintain our stranglehold on the pandemic in this province. If the disease is allowed to creep back in, future shutdowns could kill that small business lifeblood which was already strained to the max.
 So remain vigilant in your social distancing and practicing of proper hand hygiene and other health orders.
 We have a long way to go before we are out of this mess, but we will emerge because of the entrepreneurial spirit this province and country was built upon.

At the local, state and national levels, social workers are concerned about a decrease in the number of child abuse reports since the coronavirus outbreak caused schools to close.
 “Teachers report the majority of abuse and neglect, and now we’re looking at our kids being out of school from mid-March until we go back in the fall,” said Gretchen Rusden, recruitment coordinator for Embrace Treatment Foster Care, which has a local office.
 Since Gov. Ralph Northam declared a state of emergency in Virginia on March 12, the Virginia Department of Social Services has seen a 50 percent decrease in the number of child abuse and neglect hotline referrals and a 90 percent drop in referrals from school staff.
 “While we are still receiving calls, our data reflects numbers more similar to summer months—a typical June or July volume,” said Cletisha Lovelace, associate director of public affairs for Virginia DSS, adding that the department is concerned about “the potential for an increase in domestic violence and child abuse and neglect” during the social isolation imposed by the COVID-19 crisis.
 That’s why Fredericksburg’s Department of Social Services prepared the flyers to remind other essential workers—medical personnel, police and first responders as well as grocery store clerks, food delivery drivers and others—who might not be used to reporting child abuse of the role they can play in preventing it.
 “Because our traditional mandated reporters are not seeing our children, we really are relying on our essential workers to let us know if they see anything concerning,” Gallik said. “That’s what the flyers really get to. Our ability to get this information out widely to various groups of people is recently going to be instrumental in keeping our kids safe.”
 Allie Williams of Stafford County grew up in the foster care system in Colorado and has been a foster parent in Virginia for eight years. She adopted three children from foster care and is now fostering a 13-year-old girl who came to her in the beginning of March.
 Williams said her experience causes her to worry about children’s safety the longer schools remain closed.
 “For a lot of kids, school was their safe place,” she said.
 Rusden said the “inordinate” amount of family time caused by the pandemic- related shutdowns can be hard, even on those with coping skills.
 “It’s still hard with us to be at close quarters, trying to work, trying to homeschool and make sure everyone is taken care of,” she said. “If you don’t have coping skills, or appropriate coping skills, this is where we find abuse and neglect come into play.”
 “There are a lot of things people are dealing with that, unfortunately, they may be taking out on their kids,” she continued.
 Local social service departments said they are getting fewer referrals to child protective services since the outbreak began.
 In normal times, the Fredericksburg DSS receives an average of three reports of child abuse or neglect per week that are investigated and found to be merited, Newton said. Since the outbreak, that number has dropped to one or two calls per week.
 In addition to creating the flyer for essential workers, Fredericksburg DSS prepared a flyer about Child Abuse Prevention Month, which was observed nationally during April and which the department is extending locally through the end of Northam’s “shelter at home” order, set to expire June 10.
 The flyers give tips on coping skills, such as sharing feelings with family members and other trusted friends, dialing 211 to find out about local organizations that support families, playing games and doing craft projects together as a family and giving children space to share strong feelings without overreacting.
 Calls to Spotsylvania’s DSS dropped 35 percent in April compared with the same month in 2019, the department said. Of those calls, the number of serious allegations requiring investigation are down “drastically” by about 73 percent as compared with April 2019, Spotsylvania DSS Director Amy Swift said.
 “This is why we are asking that the community check in on their family, friends and neighbors,” she said.
 Swift said child abuse and neglect reports always drop whenever schools are out, but the current pandemic adds another level of concern.
 “The increased ‘worry’ this pandemic breeds is that children are not only out of sight and sound from potential community supports, but they are also now uniquely isolated at home during an extremely stressful time for them and their parents,” she wrote in an email. “Households across our community, on a good day, deal with challenges such as mental health, substance abuse, behavioral issues and financial stressors. When you add a pandemic on top of that, combined with complete isolation—yes, we are concerned.”

"Sure they're ugly, Arthur says they're double ugly, but he never refuses a plate of my baked stuffed tautog."
 Jack was putting forth an argument about a last meal of one of his favorite dishes. It was early in the season and I was up to my armpits in alligators, deadlines, and work on two boats to get ready for the fishing season.
 My old friend was no longer able to walk the four blocks from his home to the old green bridge where he spent hours at a time fishing for his very favorite fish, the tautog, or blackfish as they are known from Connecticut to New York and Jersey.
 On some days, Jack was successful but on most others he was unable to catch one of those bucktoothed, leather-lipped denizens of the deep. When he did hook a decent fish, he had the task of hauling that fish up 32 feet from the water to the deck of the bridge without having the hook pull out.
 At that time you could buy cod for less than a dollar, but Jack would spend money on bait and tackle and invest his time in an attempt to catch what he considered the best-tasting fish that inhabited local waters.
 It was early spring, and after a cold and snowy winter it would be a while before the tautog moved back inshore from their winter habitat to the shallow and warmer waters of our rivers and bays in more catchable numbers.
 I can recall many a late spring night walking the deck of the old green bridge with my dad and visiting with the fishermen lined up on both sides of the street. I could not wait to move on to the next person to look in their buckets, which were usually galvanized pails from the Dover Stamping company that was located in the big red brick building on the corner of Plymouth
 Avenue. Employees could buy seconds and we acquired a lot of them at the Weetamoe Yacht Club from a member who worked there.
 For a boy of eight or ten it was like an Easter egg hunt.
 Some pails were empty while others held a tautog or two, the occasional eel and quite a few big white perch, which were also inclined to take a bite out of a green crab or piece of clam.
 It was the sharpies with the wet burlap bags that received the most scrutiny. I recall coming up on a man with a burlap bag with a large bulge laying alongside his bucket. The fish inside was still quite alive and flipping but when I asked how the fishing was he never made eye contact. Looking straight ahead, he said he hadn't got a single bite.
 My father chuckled, took me by the hand and pulled me along.
 "That is a man who doesn't want or need any company."
 At that time, the winter flounder, or blackback, was the most popular and available fish in the Taunton River and Mt Hope Bay and those flat fish fed a lot of working-class families, including my own.
 The problem was that with their tiny mouths they did not bother with the large green crabs used for tautog bait and preferred the soft and slender texture of sea worms.
 The next most popular species was the aforementioned tautog, often referred to as tog or, toto, by the older Portuguese gents who kept boats at the boat club and the fish shacks along the river.
 I enjoyed flounder fishing, but those tautog could sure pull the string and they were much more difficult to catch than the flounder.
 In the ensuing years, the flounder has become nothing more than a fond memory and fishing for them is prohibited in Narragansett and Mt Hope Bay and their tributaries. The tautog, which are nowhere near their former abundance, are on the mend and are still available for those who don't mind putting in their time. They still prefer rocky lairs covered with mussels and they have such a craving for green crabs they will occasionally eat one with a 3/0 Kirby hook in it; if you are skillful enough to pull the trigger before your crab is stolen.
 Today we are fishing with much better tackle than the handlines of yesterday and the braided lines allow you to feel the slightest touch.
 Jack was well aware of the possibilities, or lack thereof, of catching a tog that early in the season, but for some reason that old-timer either had exceptional faith in me or knew how to
 encourage me to get the best results.
 Whatever his motives, I collected a coffee can of green crabs to use as my tackle, and without a boat in the water I headed for the bridge.
 There was very little action and only a few bites from the bait-stealing choggies. After almost two cold hours of feeding them, I was packing up my gear to head back to Jack with the bad news when George, who was fishing much closer to the Somerset side, came walking towards me.
 "It's still too cold and a bit too early for a good run of tog, but I managed to scratch up two fair-sized ones on the bottom of the outgoing tide, just before you arrived. Its been dead since then."
 I thanked him for the information and told him I would not be there without the appeal of my old friend Jack. George knew Jack and was aware of his failing health, mentioning that he had not seen him on the bridge in over two years.
 I began to walk away when he called me.
 "I'm going to make you a deal. I only need one fish for my table, and I will loan you the other for the old man, but only if he assumes you caught it."
 I thought that was an odd request, but it was a chance to fulfill the wish of a man who had been very good to this boy.
 "When you begin striper fishing and get an extra fish, think of my wife. For some reason she loves striper and would love to have a fillet."
 I took the fish and promised to fulfill my part of the bargain, to which he responded, "That fish is going to taste a lot better to him if he believes you caught it rather than knowing it was a gift from a near stranger."
 I thought about that as Jack was grinning from ear to ear at the sight of his prize. He cleaned, stuffed and baked that tog like you would a Thanksgiving turkey and the big section he sent over to my family was delicious.
 It was almost two years later when I knocked on George's door with a fresh striper fillet wrapped in wax paper. He looked at me and told me he remembered my dad and the little boy he walked the bridge with, and said he had no doubt that I would hold up my end of the bargain.
 Old Jack, who had passed on several months after baking his last tautog, went on to meet his maker with one of his last requests satisfied with the cooperation of two fellow fishermen. Amen.

NEW YORK -- Just 0.7% of Major League Baseball employees tested positive for antibodies to COVID-19, the illness caused by the new coronavirus.
   
 Researchers received 6,237 completed surveys from employees of 26 clubs. That led to 5,754 samples obtained in the U.S. on April 14 and 15 and 5,603 records that were used. The survey kit had a 0.5% false positive rate.
   
 Dr. Jay Bhattacharya of Stanford, one of the study's leaders, said the prevalence of the antibodies among MLB employees was lower than for the general population during testing in New York, Los Angeles, the San Francisco area and Miami.
   
 "I was expecting a little bit of a higher number," Bhattacharya said during a telephone news conference Sunday. "The set of people in the MLB employee population that we tested in some sense have been less affected by the COVID epidemic than their surrounding communities."
   
 Data for players was not separated in the study, and some MLB family members were included.
   
 Spring training was stopped March 12 and opening day was pushed back from March 26 because of the pandemic. MLB intends to give the players' association a presentation this week for a possible start to the season, and has said frequent testing would be necessary.
   
 Antibodies are produced by a person's immune system if they have been infected by a virus. These tests are different than the polymerise chain reaction (PCR) tests used to detect active infection.
   
 "By using two different technologies, both PCR to diminish the active virus, as well as the antibody, the serology tests, that will give you better information and may even be able to alleviate some of the concerns with false positives," said Daniel Eichner said of the Sports Medicine Research and Testing Laboratory in Salt Lake City. another of the study leaders.
   
 "So I would definitely advocate if anyone was going to put a program together to get their sport of their work back, is to utilize both different technologies," he said.
   
 The University of Southern California also participated in the study.
   
 Bhattacharya said MLB employees are younger than the overall population and took protective measures such as frequent hand washing when they reported to spring training in early February, earlier than most people.
   
 No MLB employees have been known to have died from COVID-19.
   
 While the percentage of Los Angeles Angels employees with positive test was the highest among teams, the error margin is too high to draw results because just 123 tests were included from the team.
   
 Bhattacharya called the results "both good and bad news" because they showed the virus has not spread widely in MLB but still has many baseballers left to target. Eichner said results could mean MLB employees had been diligent in use of personal protective equipment, such as masks.
   
 "If this population was social isolating and practicing good PPE, then it shows that that worked and it didn't get the spread in there," Eichner said. "And then the flip side of that is that means it's worked well, then they keep doing it."
   
 Sixty people tested positive in the raw data, and the figured was adjusted to about 42 to account for false positives and false negatives.
   
 Over 95% of the participants were under 65 and few reported comorbidities, according to Stanford medical student Bianca Mulaney, who authored the study.
   
 The Chicago Cubs, Cincinnati, Colorado and Miami did not participate, Bhattacharya said. A pre-print server will publish the study this week, and it will be sent to a journal for peer review.
   
 Test kits were provided by the Partnership for Clean Competition, which funds anti-doping research, and researchers worked for free.
   
 Mulaney said the prevalence of positive tests for antibodies was higher in areas that have been harder hit by the virus, such as New York, and lower in less-impacted areas, such as Ohio.
   
 "This is a special population. It's not it's not representative of the American population at large," Bhattacharya said. "But it's an important population because it allows us to get a peek at the nationwide prevalence."

The Minnesota Department of Education and Office of Higher Education announced Friday the state would ban large-scale graduation ceremonies, even if they were held outdoors, due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
 Many high schools and colleges had already planned virtual commencement ceremonies for students in an attempt to recognize their efforts during an extraordinary time.
 Minnesota State University sent ”commencement-in-a-box” packages to its 2,200 graduates this spring.
 “We’re disappointed that we’re not able to hold commencement ceremonies this spring,” MSU President Richard Davenport said in a written statement. “Commencement ceremonies are a tradition that can’t be replaced. But it is our hope that the special gift boxes, videos and website we have put together will show our graduates how special they are, and that we are thinking of them on this momentous day in their lives.”
 Minnesota’s second-largest public university, MSU planned three commencement ceremonies for more than 1,800 undergraduates and 400 graduate students Saturday. The pandemic and accompanying restrictions on public gatherings mean the grads instead opened their care packages in parents’ homes and off-campus apartments and possibly tuned into online videos of commencement speeches from graduating seniors in each of the university’s six colleges.
 The “commencement-in-a-box” packages include a purple-and-gold MSU-branded box, a diploma cover, commencement programs, two small branded gifts, and a personalized note from Davenport inviting them to participate in the December commencement ceremonies typically reserved for fall semester graduates.

"The city's population struggles with obesity and poverty, which can increase risks of severe illness from the pandemic," Oliver wrote, noting that Petersburg ranked 132 out of 133 Virginia localities in terms of health in the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's 2020 report.
 Oliver wrote that "access to running water helps improve hygiene" and "ensures persons can easily and routinely wash their hands and clothes."
 When asked on Sunday about Oliver's order, city spokeswoman Folakemi Osoba said that Petersburg plans to have an update this week on how it will respond to Oliver's order. On Wednesday, Osoba said that a team from the Department of Public Works and the city’s billing and collections office would contact the 46 households that lack water service, and work with residents on a case-by- case basis to determine a payment plan to have their water turned back on.
 Given the choice to help restore the homes' water last week, the City Council voted "No," 6-1, saying Petersburg can't afford to pick up the tab. That didn't sit well with Councilwoman Treska Wilson-Smith.
 “We can’t tell citizens to wash their hands if they don’t have water in their house,” Wilson-Smith said, invoking the golden rule of the COVID-19 public health crisis. Those without service also can't flush a toilet, take a shower or bath or get drinking water from the tap.
 City officials weren't sure how many of the accounts they'd turned off between July 2019 and Jan. 31 over nonpayment belonged to homes with people living inside until last week, when police, public works employees and Ferrell- Benavides fanned out to check 264 residences.
 The survey came after Del. Lashrecse Aird, whose district includes Petersburg, sent the city a formal request to identify the homes and restore service; 731 accounts were suspended between July and January.
 Oliver’s order is a “long awaited relief for the households,” Aird said on Sunday, commending both Oliver and Gov. Ralph Northam for responding to requests from her and others.
 “I eagerly await the local government to begin the process of restoring the water to these homes immediately,” Aird said.
 The city is owed about $3.25 million in back pay for water and budgets to receive $15 million in utility payments during the fiscal year that begins July 1. Collections have been a consistent thorn in the municipality’s side; the city four years earlier teetered on the brink of insolvency after the flawed roll-out of a new utility billing system.
 When Wilson-Smith began lobbying her colleagues last month to establish an amnesty program that would forgive payments and resume service under a special contract, Mayor Samuel Parham sent a letter in response calling her plan "an act of socialism."

The smell of yeast filled my nostrils as I moved closer to peer inside. The moist, tan dough, the size of a grapefruit, sat in a round glob and swelled to fill its space. Time passed in silence as the dough continued to rise, turning into a square shape that filled the bottom third of the pan.
 “It appears to be working,” I said to my husband optimistically as he headed outside to work in the yard.
 As the bread baked, its fragrance filled the house.
 “Mmmm, that smells good,” my husband said as he walked in the door.
 That’s a good sign, I thought to myself. I looked through the window of the bread maker. It was browning nicely and looked fully cooked with five minutes to go. “Beep.”
 After I removed the bread from the pan and allowed it to cool, I cut a slice for the taste test. It had a light texture and smelled and tasted of wheat grain with a hint of honey. I cut another slice, toasted it and put butter on it. It was good. I waited for the real test, my husband’s response. He toasted a slice and added butter.
 “Mmmm, this is delicious,” he said. “Mmmm, what’s in it?”
 I read the ingredients out loud to him.
 “Water, local honey, safflower oil, salt, whole wheat flour, bread flour and active dry yeast,” I said. “No sugar or preservatives.”
 The machine also has a timing unit. I can add the ingredients, set the timer and wake up to the smell of freshly baked bread just in time for breakfast.
 It was easy to make and easy to clean up. It came out perfect. I look forward to experimenting with more varieties. My bread machine has earned its way off the shelf and into our kitchen.

We come not to praise the loogie, but to bury it.
   
 Already banned on sidewalks, outlawed indoors and pooh-poohed by polite society, that gob of saliva and Lord-knows-what-else is done mucking up sports. In the wake of the new coronavirus, teams are revoking the germ- landing privileges that turned dugouts, benches, boxing rings and even grass fields into potential biohazard sites.
   
 No sharing towels, hats, bats, gloves or water bottles. Which could mean the golden era of spitting, slobbering, gleaking, glanding, hawking, hocking, venoming and expectorating is about to dry up. Or not.
   
 "About time they did something," said Bobby Valentine, who played and managed in the major leagues for more than 40 years, including two stints in the Japanese Pacific League.
   
 "I was over there for seven years and I could probably count on one hand how many times I saw a ballplayer spit. Heck," he added, "they don't even chew gum."
   
 But a moment later, Valentine remembers a photo tucked in a drawer somewhere in his Stamford, Connecticut, home. It reminds him why the loogie will not disappear without a fight.
   
 "It's a picture of me after a game from 30 years ago, back when I was managing the Rangers and behind me there's this elongated view of the dugout. There must have been 200 of those green Gatorade cups and all this other … let's just say gunk, laying around.
   
 "And I used to wonder even then," Valentine mused, "why guys couldn't clean up after themselves."
   
 The answer may be as old -- and as American -- as the sport itself. Baseball began as a working-man's game on sandlots and dusty diamonds, and more than a few players struggling with "cotton mouth" turned to chewing tobacco (and later gum and sunflower seeds) to work up some moisture. It became an institution in no time flat.
   
 Pitchers figured out that loading a glob onto one side of the ball made it dip like crazy. Fielders pounded spit into the pocket of stiff leather gloves to soften them up and hitters rubbed it on their hands or lacquered up bat handles to improve their grips, at least temporarily. But it had psychological value, too.
   
 Spitting helped some soothe jangling nerves, show contempt or machismo, or just mark their territory like dogs do. It was only a problem when an opponent got in the way of its gravity.
   
 It isn't just baseball, of course. Rough-and-tumble sports like soccer and football embraced the practice at the beginnings of their games, too, and once grabbing a swig of water on the sidelines during a break became available, it practically elevated it into an art form. But don't expect any new masterpieces to flow soon.
   
 With Germany's Bundesliga considering a return to play within week s, Michel D'Hooghe, the chairman of FIFA's medical committee, is strongly advising against any soccer league restarting until the fall. But if they do, he wants even the most casual dribble on the pitch punished with a yellow card.
   
 "It is unhygienic … I think we should have to avoid that at maximum," D'Hooghe said. "The question is whether that will be possible."
   
 More genteel pursuits like tennis and golf have proved that it is, although both Tiger Woods and Sergio Garcia handed over hefty fines for leaving something besides sweat out on the course.
   
 Basketball and hockey are stuck indoors, but only one of them said no to spitting. Puckheads defend hockey's choice by arguing players who get a tooth knocked out during a game shouldn't have to swallow a chiclet. Fair enough. But if you've ever watched a game and seen how much blood, sweat and tears they voluntarily share on the bench, it shouldn't come as a surprise that the National Hockey League has been hit twice in recent years by outbreaks of mumps.
   
 But that's about to change. The coronavirus has pulled the rug out from underneath just about everything in sports, and better sanitation shouldn't require a seismic cultural shift. Just rise at some ungodly hour and catch a Korean Baseball Organization game on ESPN.
   
 The KBO is at the vanguard in the return of live sports. It checks players' temperatures twice daily, requires umpires and trainers to wear masks and gloves, and banned spitting, handshakes, fist-bumps, high-fives and perhaps most noticeably, a live audience.
   
 That's been replaced by banners picturing fans -- also wearing masks -- stretched across every row. In a spectacularly complicated nod to social distancing, the opening pitch was rolled to home plate by a youngster wearing a uniform inside a clear balloon made up to look like a baseball.
   
 Dan Straily, an American-born pitcher with the Lotte Giants of the KBO, said the game lacked so much energy, it reminded him of "weekday games in Oakland." Still, he had only one real complaint.
   
 "I want someone to find me a game in history where baseball players did not spit on the field," Straily told NPR.

For the past 20 years, more and more consumers were spending less time in the kitchen and less time eating meals at home. On average, people were eating away from home at least 3 days per week and many much more than that. The rapid growth in the fast food and food service sectors is a reflection of this trend. Even when food was prepared at home, time was limited and convenience was a driving factor for food choices.  The livestock industry identified this trend and began making changes to the products it offered.  Checkoff funds were devoted to developing ready to heat and eat meat options as well as recipes that were quick and easy. Unlike previous generations, many modern mothers lacked sophisticated cooking skills and did not have the time or confidence to make something from scratch.

Amazing. A painting. Were these real people ? Probably. 1000 years ago. Their faces are fair and almost perfect complexion. A lot of resemblence, in their lips and mouth. Small mouth but full lips. Look at their, her appears to be painted or feathered, on the man as well. A fashion, or sense of one, the leaves as a crown, cloth for clothing, so accepted to them. Her fingernails are short, probably ground down finely, but with what ? She has a ring and bracelet. Her neckless and earrings look to be made of gold -no doubt. Her jewelery would be considered poorly skilled by todays standards. It was skilled by hand from scratch, hence a true meaning of man-made. She loves her ring. I see them just like us all, but in a way so different. We will never know what it was really like living then.
