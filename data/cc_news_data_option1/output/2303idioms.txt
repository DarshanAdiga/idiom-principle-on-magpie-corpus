The bronze statue was put up three years after his death in 1850, and was given listed status in 1972, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.
 "Given the current national focus on memorials, including statues of Robert Peel, we feel it necessary to take extra precautions to protect Tamworth's 167-year-old Peel monument for the time being and fence it off.
 "The Tamworth MP and former prime minister Robert Peel depicted in the Tamworth statue was anti-slavery and supported its abolition, and it is widely felt he has been confused with his father, who opposed the Foreign Slave Trade Abolition Bill," Mr Cook said.
 Tamworth MP Christopher Pincher said the statue was being protected from "agitators who can't get their history right".

My son's first taste of tofu was at a restaurant. He didn't know what tofu was, or that it was coming. Having never caught wind of tofu's bad reputation among non-Asians, he took a bite of its sauce-drenched, crispy fried goodness with an open mind. He chewed through its golden barrier and into its moist, pillowy interior. Grunting his approval, he kept eating. That, ideally, is how you meet and greet tofu.      Most tofu virgins know it's out there. They've heard the stories of what this personality-free substance doesn't taste like. Unless their first bite is at a restaurant, their fears are likely confirmed. Statistically speaking, non- Asians do a poor job cooking tofu, my dad included.   He called tofu "bean curd," like you did back in the 1970s. He explained it was something I would be eating in place of meat, which I had recently sworn off at age 7 for ethical reasons.      Dad was a good cook, and while bean curd was not his strong suit, he made a well-researched attempt. I vividly remember its chalky, flaccid, absent presence.      His intentions were pure, but dad could not have devised a more effective way to change my mind about vegetarianism.      If dad had known then what I know now about freezing tofu, I might still be a vegetarian. But at least in my lifetime I have been able to finish what he started. I'm not referring to the fact that I have become one of those weirdos who likes raw, unseasoned tofu, but the fact that   I now know how to cook it like the pros.      This time of year, with so many new veggies in season, stir-fries are in play, and some proper tofu can make any stir-fry seem royal. But tofu's default state is lame and flavorless, characteristics that will carry through to the finished product unless you take measures. Namely, put your brick of firm tofu in the freezer for a few days.      That's mostly it, actually. That, and some cornstarch and sauce, and you're set.      It isn't law that you put golden cubes of crispy, meaty, succulent tofu into every stir-fry. It is, however, something of a tradition for a reason. And adding tofu doesn't mean skipping meat, depending on your inclinations. Tofu is great with every type of animal protein, from chicken to eggs to bacon to seafood.      There is a lot going on in a stir-fry, and it's easy to overlook the tofu, which would be a mistake. Just ask generations of disappointed tofu tasters. Or ask my son, who lights up for "restaurant tofu."      Restaurant tofu has a resilient, fleshy quality, a tasty brown skin that holds onto sauce, and a springy, moist interior. Tofu is mostly water, and when you freeze it that water expands, rupturing channels through the tofu as it tries to push its way out. Those channels will soon act as portals to allow in what we call "restaurant sauce." You can guess the kinds of restaurants we frequent from its recipe below.      I dust the saucy cubes with cornstarch and deep-fry them into golden blocks of joy that explode with flavor when you crunch through, like restaurant tofu should.      For a fun side dish, save the onions from the marinade, roll them in extra cornstarch, and deep fry into a tasty side, snack or garnish.      Marinated Restaurant Tofu   Serves 2   • 1 (12 oz.) brick firm or extra-firm tofu, frozen for at least three days, thawed overnight, squeezed of excess water and cut into ½-inch cubes   • 1 tablespoon each soy sauce, oyster sauce, rice vinegar   • 1 teaspoon each fish sauce, hoisin sauce, hot sauce, sesame oil, brown sugar   • ¼ teaspoon black pepper   • ¼ onion, sliced and teased apart   • 2 cloves garlic, minced   • 1 cubic inch ginger, peeled and sliced   • 2 cups vegetable oil   • 4 tablespoons cornstarch (more for onion ginger garlic fritter rings)      Mix all of the sauces, along with the onion, garlic, ginger, brown sugar and black pepper, and toss the tofu in the sauce. It will absorb every last drop.      Heat the vegetable oil to 350 degrees in a small, deep pan suitable for frying. While the oil is heating, toss the tofu cubes and cornstarch in a bowl until the tofu is coated. Save the onions for later.      Deep-fry the cubes 2 to 4 minutes, depending on how dark and crispy you want them. Remove and allow to drain and cool in a colander or on paper towels.   Toss the onion sections in the cornstarch, adding more if necessary, and then fry these onions in the hot oil. They take a bit longer to cook because of all of the water. Don't stir them. Let it fry into a 3D matrix.      If serving your tofu with a stir-fry, prepare the tofu first. Don't add to the stir-fry until serving time, or serve it on the side, ready to mix in.

 City GuideGreeleyThey say in real estate: location, location, location. In this case, the location boasts both gorgeous mountain vistas and expansive, flowing plains. The town of Greeley, located in central Colorado, is nestled in the Front Range foothills at the foot of the gorgeous Rocky Mountains. Greeley, CO can chase its roots as far back as the Oregon Trail; the town is adjacent to a former popular stop and post office on the trek out West in the late 1800s.
 Life in Greeley
 +
 While property sales have stayed relatively constant, the median sale price of a Greeley home has vastly increased over the past five years from approximately $125k to about $180k. That’s a positive jump of over 30% since 2009, more than big brother Denver can say. Further north and west of 8th Ave/US 85 decrease in price of housing.
 First and foremost, newcomers should be prepared for a challenge when first coming to Greely since a large majority of the streets running both directions are in sequential order; with numbered ‘St’ running East-West and numbered ‘Ave’ running North-South. 8th Ave serves as the main border road to the East of the university, and is the place to be any day - or night - of the week. Highway 34 serves as a border road to the South while also providing quick and easy access out of town, and I-25. Most residential and commercial buildings in Greeley are contained within the area northwest of the 8th Ave/Highway 34 intersection, with some new housing developing directly to the East of 8th Ave. These newly built homes are not alone; construction is seemingly sprouting up everywhere.
 Renters make up half of Greeley’s population. Most of these are students studying at the University of Northern Colorado. Though typically regarded and known for its top-notch nursing school, UNC has produced recent success both scholastically in the nursing program, and athletically, appearing in the 2011 NCAA Men’s Basketball Tournament.
 If you’re looking for a place to rent for an incoming University of Northern Colorado student beyond on-campus housing, the area just north of 20th Street has multiple unit housing available. Most available rentals in this area are on a first come, first served basis. Typically prospective renters can be patient to find the “right” space, but should be prepared to agree to terms on a lease – paperwork in hand - the moment they visit the unit. Planning on an August or May move-in date could be good for free help with the beginning and end of the college terms (don’t tell ‘em I told you). But generally, finding and moving into rental units during June and July can save money on the monthly rent. As the college student population disperses for the summer months, landlords have a smaller pool of renters to choose from and the higher competition drives down prices. Lock in a summer rate for a full twelve month contract and save serious cash over the length of a full college term and then some.
 Using US 85 to travel the 60 miles south to DIA avoids dreaded I25 & I70 traffic through Denver, while boasting a DIA arrival in the same or less amount of time as it would take through the Interstate 25/70 corridor...with no traffic.
 Access to the quintessential Colorado getaway in the Rock Mountains is surprisingly simple despite Greeley’s proximity to wide open eastern plains. Again unlike most Colorado residents and tourists, Greeley residents can drive to Rocky Mountain National Park in just over an hour and a half using US 36, rather than an Interstate which is typical. And again they can do it in the same amount of time, or less.

  Herbek, the acting Woodbury County medical examiner at the time, and other pathologists and forensic experts were tasked with identifying the victims and assisting in the crash investigation.


  He joined Methodist in 2004, serving as medical director of transfusion and coagulation services for the hospital’s pathology center. He also was medical director of the Methodist Women’s Hospital laboratory.


  At Methodist, he helped lead efforts to conserve blood, both to improve patient care and reduce dependence on donated blood supplies. As president- elect of the pathologists’ group in 2012, he called for making sharing of patients’ medical records easier and urged federal officials to help.


  “Dr. Herbek’s enthusiasm for people, life and the practice of pathology was evident every day in everything he did and to everyone who had the pleasure of meeting him,” Dr. Deborah Perry, medical director for pathology at Methodist Hospital, said in a statement. “He shared his experiences, stories and wisdom and always had time to talk.”


  In addition to his wife and daughter, Herbek is survived by daughter Emily Frezell of Omaha; brother Robert Herbek and mother Mary Herbek, both of Hastings; and one granddaughter.

Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said he gave prosecutors a full account of how he handled the coronavirus pandemic that devastated Italy, adding he did not fear a judicial probe would be opened.
 "I explained everything to prosecutors. I am totally calm," Conte said in an interview published Saturday after he was grilled for about three hours on Friday over his handling of the emergency.
 "I detailed all the stages in these terrible days during which we fought an invisible enemy. I have nothing to fear," the premier told La Stampa newspaper.
 Conte said he believes he "acted based on science and conscience," adding: "I have the serenity of one who always carried out each step with the scientific technical committee" offering advice.
 "I am not expecting to receive a notice of an opening of a judicial investigation. I have never feared one," he added.
 The epidemic has killed more than 34,000 people in Italy, one of the hardest- hit countries in the world, mostly in the nation's north.
 Chief prosecutor Maria Cristina Rota and her team are trying to find out why a lockdown was not enforced early in the health emergency around the towns of Nembro and Alzano in the northern province of Bergamo.
 Health experts say had the area been quarantined, many lives would have been saved.
 The team has already met with senior officials in Lombardy, who say it was up to Rome to decide whether certain areas should be shut.
 Conte has countered that regions had full discretion to close certain areas where the virus had begun to flare in late February and early March.
 "As I have already told investigating magistrates, the chronology of events is very clear," the premier told La Stampa.
 "In light of the epidemiological framework available to us during the first week of March, it would have made no sense to close only the towns of Alzano and Nembro," he said.
 "Our problem at that moment already was to study drastic and immediate solutions for all of Italy. And that's what we did."
 The first town in Italy to be quarantined was Codogno, about an hour south of Nembro and Alzano, on February 21.
 Another nine towns around Codogno were subsequently locked down before the entire region of Lombardy and 14 provinces in neighbouring regions of Veneto, Piedmont and Emilia Romagna were quarantined on March 8.
 Conte imposed a nationwide quarantine on March 10.

At times, the June 6 rally against racism in Effingham was more of a religious revival with references to the Bible and church songs.
   
 There were no hateful words, just expressions of hope that people in Effingham County can change their attitudes toward people of color just as demonstrations across the country are showing that racism in all its forms is becoming unacceptable. The rally was dedicated to George Floyd, who was killed while being held down by Minneapolis police officers on May 25 after being arrested for using a counterfeit bill. A shocking video showed an officer holding his knee on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes even as Floyd said he could not breathe.
   
 A crowd of about 500 people gathered under the trees in front of the Effingham Courthouse gazebo where speakers offered inspiration for the cause of Black Lives Matter and musicians played songs similar to those used by the civil rights movement decades ago. The rally, like hundreds across the United States took aim at systematic racism, which can involve police brutality toward African Americans. The rally did not claim local law enforcement engages in brutality or injustice toward people of color.
   
 Some of the speakers talked about what it is like to be a person of color in Effingham County.
   
 Skylar Rogers of Altamont talked about being a mixed-race married couple in these times after asking a show of hands from other mixed-race couples in the crowd - several raised their hands. She said there are places where her white husband can go and be welcomed, and places where she can go, and he is not welcomed.
   
 "That is not acceptable!" Rogers shouted out and drew cheers and applause from the crowd. "Change brings discomfort. When I moved her 10 years ago, I'll admit I was apprehensive. Effingham as well as the surrounding communities were historically known as 'Sundown Towns.' How could a place like that accept someone who looked like me? Have there been incidences of disdainful glances at us? Yes. Because I am an outsider and I could be one of those people who bring crime and other undesirable circumstances to their personal world. With that being said, however, I have become part of a community that I have come to love. It feels amazing to be walking into a business and have the owner greet me as a friend. Not as a threat, not as someone who they have to watch. But someone who has come to support their business and sees me as a person. This is the community I am proud to be a part of."
   
 Rogers said faith and hope can change communities that once refused to accept people of color even for an overnight stay in a motel. She referred to the Cross of the Crossroads that shows Effingham's commitment to faith, and therefore, it should accept all people by changing attitudes toward race.
   
 "Change also brings hope. Hope that this community can see beyond color, beyond the borders of this community and bring hope for a better tomorrow," she said. "The Bible speaks on faith and hope but specifically says, 'The greatest of these is love.'"
   
 She quoted Martin King Jr. on how hate was unacceptable for him. "I refuse to hate. It's too big a burden to bear." Many have said hate is based on fear. "Love is the one thing that can bring change," she said before singing "Amazing Grace" that had many in the crowd joining in during a very emotional moment.
   
 Terrence Hill, an Effingham High School record-setting athlete and talented student now attending college, talked about how his dark skin caused a local white girl to stop seeing him. It was not her choice, but her family that forced it. For the most part, Hill said he was well-accepted by the community, but that memory is a bitter one.
   
 Matt Robinson, a recent EHS graduate and one of the organizers of the rally, talked about how being black in a small town means you're asked in businesses if you are from here or a white teammate blurts out he accepts you because you're not really black.
   
 Effingham resident and musician Bill Passalacqua had the crowd joining in when he sang "This Land is your Land." He also talked about how some people in the crowd had taken risks by attending the rally by losing jobs or being threatened with dismissal or being shunned by their family members, hopefully temporarily. He told of a shouting match he had with a long-time friend over the rally.
   
 "Whereas, the county and city have been very supportive, it has been some unelected bigwigs who have been most opposed to our gathering," Passalacqua said. "What they don't get is change is coming. As it should have decades ago. And all we are doing is ushering in that change as righteously and as peacefully as possible."
   
 Just as Black Lives Matter is fighting for the rights of African Americans today, Passalacqua encouraged local residents to stand up for their First Amendment rights and defy people opposed to justice.
   
 There were many young people in the crowd including several from Jasper County inspired to organize a similar rally in Newton on June 13.
   
 Damien Hartke, a Newton Community High School alumnus, said he was impressed by the turnout and some of the messages. When asked what he thought of Terrence Hill's comments about some racial prejudice he experienced in Effingham, Hartke agreed that also happens in Jasper County.
   
 "I heard stores like that when I was in school," Hartke said. He agreed that is demeaning and unfair.
   
 Mitch Bierman, who was a football teammate with Hartke in 2016, was glad to see people from this area letting go and doing what is right.
   
 "I was impressed that people have finally let go of what other people thought of them. And they stood up for what's morally right, not just what other people think. And what is morally right in their town. More people need to think about moral justice and what is going on in America. And forget what their immediate circle thinks about them what the town's image should be," Bierman said.
   
 Bierman said it is wrong for people to just think about the rioters and looters because they are not the true face of the protest movement. He noted how peaceful the Effingham rally was.
   
 Anna Habing, part of the Social Justice Group that organized the rally and one of the presenters, was thrilled by the turnout to the Square. She said the event was peaceful and did not seem to draw any counter-protests.
   
 Some adults brought their children to the Effingham rally, which included a march around the Courthouse Square. Some called it a moment in history that they wanted their children or grandchildren to witness.
   
 The question now is whether the rally will change local history or simply be a historic footnote.

And then you got Martin Luther King giving himself up marching, nonviolent, getting arrested, getting calls. Little girls getting bombed in Birmingham. It was all going on because people wanted to be treated like they were supposed to be treated, like humans.


  Growing up in Louisiana, we understood who the bad folks were. I'm from Zachary, Louisiana. Six miles down the road is Baker. I remember stopping at a red light and the KKK was passing out pamphlets in their hoods. That was a scare tactic to black folks, to keep them in their place.


  There were so many young people, from Emmett Till [1955] to the bombing of the little girls in Birmingham [1963] and the Freedom Riders, the two whites and a black in Philadelphia, Mississippi, who got burned in their car [1964]. You just remember them. You go back to that, to where we are today. That's [56] years and we're still doing this. I told my wife this morning [June 8] that George Floyd will be remembered for the rest of our lives.


  Out of all the Tamir Rices and Trayvon Martins, all the other blacks that were brutally killed in the arms of the police or what have you, George Floyd will stand out the most because we're not just talking about the United States protesting, we're talking about the world. This is the worst time with the pandemic, so there are two major issues in 2020 that should -- should -- change the world. Whoever thought it would be with a kneeling? There was so much controversy a few years ago about kneeling. Kneeling during the anthem is different than kneeling on the neck. Some people want to put so much emphasis on the looters. That's a small, small, small percentage out there compared to the people peacefully protesting.

  The good thing about this is we got young folks doing it, black and white young folks, across the United States and across all seven seas. We've got people who can't speak English doing it because they saw it in broad daylight. We can't do it alone. Where are the hearts of the good people in white America? We've got all kinds of religious folks whose main goal is to try to get into heaven and they're all reading the Bible and talking about God and God's children. I grew up around the church and some things a lot of people stand for, they didn't tell me those things in church. I'm not one to preach the Bible to nobody, but I do know being around my grandma and my mama and everyone I know that was strong religious folk, moralistically if you're a Christian and a good person with moralistic values, you can't put up with some of this stuff.


  A lot of this is homeschooled. I've got eight kids, and two are in school here and they're definitely in the minority. They don't have a hatred bone toward no one they go to school with. I've had some incidents where they came home and said a little kid called them a name. How else would a second- or third-grader know to call them a certain name? You look at videos and you see a son or a daughter riding in the back of their parents' car with their middle fingers up. That's sickening. What kind of parents teach their kids that you're better than the next guy? Hopefully the parents become better parents; don't tell your kids you're better than him because his skin is a little darker than yours. That's so unfortunate. The last few weeks have been teaching moments.


  It shows you how important race relations are, because so many came out upon this situation. That says a lot about a lot of people in this country, how important changing the culture is in the United States, which is supposed to be the strongest and the biggest.

HORNELL -- There will be Independence Day fireworks in the Maple City on July 4th, but none of the other traditional trappings that accompany the nation's birthday will take place.
 The Hornell Board of Public Safety did as expected Thursday -- suspending the city's July 4 parade and Independence Day festival in Veterans Memorial Park at James Street.
 Municipalities throughout Steuben County and the State of New York have cancelled annual summer festivals and other large gatherings in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Arkport Summerfest, the Allegany County Fair and the Wellsville Balloon Rally are a few of the traditional summer crowd draws that won't take place in 2020.
 The text of the resolution approved by the city safety board Thursday morning reads as follows: "(The) Board of Public Safety hereby suspends the Independence Day parade and the festivities at James Street Park, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 "That's based on our consultation with our partners at Steuben County and state reps as well," Mayor John Buckley said.
 The annual fireworks display is still a go, however.
 "We will have fireworks at night. The Board of Public Safety encourages everyone to practice social distancing when observing the fireworks," Buckley said.
 Hornell K9 Program
 Community contributions have put the Hornell K9 Program over the top as far as fundraising goes, and K9 Snitch and handler Seth Blanchard, a Hornell police officer, are in service, the Board of Public Safety was told.
 Police Chief Ted Murray thanked the community groups, businesses and individuals who donated money and resources to make the program a reality.
 "The K-9 vehicle is now fully suited and up and running," Buckley added. "Strobels (Supply) donated their time and effort and actually painted it for us. That was a really nice thing for them to do.
 "The vehicle itself, everything that went into it was all donated, so nothing related to that vehicle came out of the city budget. That was all donations from community members, organizations and businesses."
 Murray said Snitch, a yellow Lab, has completed her training as a K9 dog.
 New Police Department Vehicles
 The Hornell PD has taken delivery of two new Dodge Durangos, according to public safety officials. The city has a leasing agreement with Maple City Dodge for three Durangos, with one still on order.
 One of the delivered Durangos is currently minus a police radio.
 Once the full fleet is in service, the new vehicles will be broken in cautiously, Murray told the Public Safety Board.
 Buckley said, "What we plan on doing is assigning one Durango to each shift. We have three different shifts and three Durangos, so instead of everyone driving a new Durango all the time, this way it will stagger them and hopefully extend their life by trying to spread out the workload."
 The lease agreement allows the city to forgo payments this year.
 "That's the nice thing," Buckley said. "When we enter into a lease agreement, we don't actually start getting billed for that until 12 months after the fact, so it gives us a little breathing room, especially this year of all years when revenues are basically falling off a cliff, so that definitely helps us out."
 Duane Street Parking
 The Board of Public Safety approved a resolution to prohibit parking on the west side of Duane Street. The resolution now advances to the Law and Ordinance Committee. If approved in committee, the measure will come before the full Hornell Common Council.
 Buckley said the resolution arose from "feedback from the residents there and alderman John Carbone who lives down there as well."
 "On the one end it was getting bottlenecked because of parking on both sides to the point where it would be almost impossible to get a firetruck or a dump truck or snowplow through there," the mayor said.
 Outdoor dining
 The city wants to assist restaurants trying to bounce back from the New York State on Pause restrictions. Buckley said the city will work with restaurants that seek to provide or expand some outdoor dining seating for customers.

For those who've long wanted Charlotte to rid itself of the 2020 Republican National Convention, Donald Trump's tweets on it Tuesday were a strong reminder why.
   
 The president packed a lot of wrong into a handful of words. He said N.C. Gov. Roy Cooper refused to guarantee Republicans "use of the Spectrum Arena," which was untrue. He said the governor was "still in Shelter-In-Place Mode," which isn't accurate. He said, finally, that he was forced to seek another home for his convention "because of @NC_Governor."
   
 That's wrong.
   
 Charlotte losing the convention -- or at least the big events associated with it -- is not about a Republican president vs. a "Democrat governor," as Trump has called Cooper more than once. It isn't about any of the ideological things the president and his supporters might like it to be about.
   
 It's about public health. That's it. Roy Cooper wanted to protect the health of North Carolinians. Donald Trump was thinking about himself.
   
 After a week of trying to get the other to say "no," the governor and the president landed in a place that seemed inevitable all along. The president made the governor an offer he couldn't accept -- guarantee a full convention, a packed Spectrum arena with no requirements to wear masks or practice distancing. In other words, pretend that COVID-19 wasn't too big of a deal, just as the president has so often tried to do.
   
 To guarantee Trump his triumphant final-night convention moment three months before it happens, while COVID-19 metrics are still rising in our state and with little sense of the landscape in August, would have been a dereliction of duty for Cooper.
   
 It's true, as this editorial board has said, that the president and his party were in a pinch. They understandably didn't like the thought of making plans and investing millions only to have the governor lock the doors because COVID-19 was spiking in August. We wish the RNC and Trump chose the responsible wait-and-see approach Democrats are taking with their August convention in Milwaukee, but if the president is insistent on his convention- goers partying like it's 2019, he needs to find a city and state where leaders care as little as he does about the risks.
   
 It's also true that even if some RNC meetings stay here, the loss of the full convention will sting for Charlotte. While the coronavirus might have dampened the $100-200 million estimated economic impact of RNC 2020, big money was coming here. Businesses big and small‚ along with their employees - would have seen a much-needed boost to the bottom line. Even if you believe that public health is more important than potential revenue, it's hard to see those dollars go away.
   
 It might, however, be a bit of a relief. The convention presented an additional safety issue with this spring of discontent possibly bleeding into summer. Given the president's growing combativeness with protests, it's not hard to imagine a heavily militarized police force clashing with angry demonstrators in August. The president is spoiling for a fight. Charlotte could have been the battleground.
   
 Instead, it appears that another city will reap the revenue and take on the risks of Donald Trump's big week. RNC 2020 is among the more unpredictable conventions -- other than the nominee, of course -- in history. But of all the uncertainties surrounding August, one mattered most -- the health of Charlotte and the people who were coming to North Carolina. Roy Cooper cared about that more than Donald Trump. -- The Charlotte Observer

Consider this simplified example. Let's say you are a day trader, and you buy a stock for $10,000. It goes down by 20% today, so you sell and cut your losses and now have $8,000. The next day, you buy another stock, and it goes up by 20%. Your $8,000 is now $9,600 and you're _still_ down. If the same two- day cycle repeats, you'll be down to a little over $9,200, even though you gained and lost the same percentages each day. When you're a day trader, losses _really_ hurt. And this doesn't include the effects of trading with margin (borrowed money), which is extremely common among day traders.

Prior to the vote, Rogers gave a presentation on current health metrics that showed the county has already met or is on track to meet each of the state’s 15-point requirements. Three of the metrics the county does not yet meet consistently — hospital admissions, contact tracers and daily testing numbers — are “on track” to be met, Rogers said. More importantly, she said, she and her colleagues in the health department feel comfortable that the county is prepared for a surge in cases and hospitalizations should it come. Rogers also said that the focus of future health orders will turn to personal responsibility and requiring residents to continue practices like hand washing, wearing face coverings and social distancing.
 In response to a question from Supervisor David Canepa, Rogers said some other counties in have been approved for variances without meeting the full state criteria. Today, she said, the state is monitoring each county’s metrics closely and reengaging with those that are no longer performing up to par.
 Over the past few weeks, San Mateo County leaders have suggested that the county is close to meeting the state’s requirements for a variance, but had yet to achieve some metrics, like decreasing hospitalizations and new cases.
 But County Manager Mike Callagy said at a recent press briefing the county’s hospitalization numbers have been going down as it increases testing, contact tracing and the personal protective equipment supply.
 “Basically, on any given day, we might meet most of the measures or even all of the measures, but what the state is looking at is what has our trend been either for the last seven days or the last 14 days,” Srija Srinivasan, deputy chief of San Mateo County Health, said at the press briefing earlier this week.
 Outside of the Bay Area, almost every county in California has now moved beyond the state, which is currently in “early Stage 2” of its Resilience Roadmap plan to reopen. Up to this point, San Mateo County has attempted to be more strict or aligned with the state — and seeking a variance would be the first indication the health department wishes to open further.
 “Currently, the county does not allow dine-in restaurants, hair salons and barber shops, museums, gyms and fitness centers hotels for tourism and travel to open,” a county update reads. “If approved by the state, the variance would allow Dr. Morrow to issue a new health order that, when he deems appropriate, could open additional businesses with restrictions that may include social distancing, face coverings and additional health precautions.”

The UK's hospitals have been among the main breeding grounds for spreading Covid-19, with one in five patients catching the virus while in hospital, scientists say.
 Papers published by Sage, and prepared for the Cabinet Office, showed that at the peak of the crisis, transmission within hospitals was thought to account for around 22 percent of cases in hospitalised patients, or more to 11 per cent of deaths.
 The figures did not include staff, or those attending outpatients appointments, so the numbers might be an underestimate.
 In light of the data, a letter from NHS England Medical Director Professor Stephen Powis has been sent to hospitals instructing them to 'minimise' close contact between staff and urges workers to 'avoid congregating at central work stations' and simply take staggered breaks.

  City GuideDunedin


  Dunedin was so named from the original Gaelic for Edinburgh, as it was settled by Scottish folk homesick for the highlands of their countryside. And the Scottish heritage is still strong in this sunny seaside town, as yearly festivals celebrate bag piping and more at the Dunedin Highland Games.


  Dunedin features a gorgeous location with a mixture of sporty outdoorsy activities. Enjoy a range of options, from soccer to swimming to biking on the 39 miles of pathway called the Pinellas Trail. If those features arent enough to send you high-tailing it to the East Coast, perhaps the world-class beaches will do the trick. Yeah, the weather can be a bit of a pill; welcome to Florida. And sure, there are some weirdos living right out in the open in this state, but Dunedin is a peaceful little retreat that should cost an arm and a leg but doesnt. Start researching those bagpipe lessons now.


  Prepare For Weather


  Dunedin is on the coast, where residents can enjoy sunshine, sandy beaches and, oh yeah, hurricane season. Yep, youre gonna have to prepare for that eventuality if you live anywhere near the beach in Florida (otherwise known as anywhere in Florida). Plus, summers tend to be rather wet, with thunderstorms traveling through and soaking everyone midday. Humidity is also a bummer, and so are mosquitoes, but DEET exists for a reason and so does air conditioning. Start buying stock in both (Can you buy stock in air conditioning? Find out.). Other than that, it’s a paradise, so pack your flip-flops; youre done shoveling snow and wearing sweaters.


  Outdoor Lifestyle


  You may have gathered from the beach-adjacent address that Dunedin inhabitants love outdoorsy activities and not just sunbathing and snorkeling either. This is where the Toronto Blue Jays have their spring training camp, and it’s filled with youth programs and sports leagues for soccer, basketball, football and more. Theres also an awesomely extensive 39-mile bike and pedestrian path called the Pinellas Trail. It cuts right through downtown Dunedin and was spearheaded by a local bike store called The Energy Conservatory Bike Shop. Folks are also pretty local-minded, eschewing commercial signage, chain stores and franchise restaurants in favor of mom and pops and the like. It makes for a charming and welcoming spot for visitors and year-round dwellers.


  Cost of Living


  Well, you had to know it would be more expensive than many Florida locations. But it’s still Florida, so it’s lower cost than many other coastal areas. In fact, it’s still less expensive than the nation’s average overall, but housing does drive the cost of living up just a smidge. Fortunately, the walkable neighborhoods, high vacancy rates, gorgeous landscape, well-educated residents and playful college students more than make up for Dunedins high housing costs. It is good to know, however, that most people are homeowners here, and renters are a bit rarer. There are plenty of both, ultimately, but expect a fair number of seasonal owners and well-entrenched families.


  Districts


  There aren’t neighborhoods so much as general areas of Dunedin. If you show up and ask for a house in the Hammock Park neighborhood, you may get a raised eyebrow in return, but they’ll generally know what you mean.

 “He’ll never forget the scolding I gave him!”
 “I think I peeled paint off the wall when I bawled her out like a sailor!”
 “I reamed him out! He’ll never cross me again!”
 A young woman recently told me someone who had been important to her had called her the “B” word.
 To counteract his label, I ask her to list all her good qualities, talents, gifts and blessings. I did the same. We brought our lists together and read them aloud for her hearing.
 I surmised, “The beauty of your life disproves his label. You are on the honor roll of living life.”

 Summertime is surely upon us! Between 95-degree days and thunderstorms, it's beach time and pool parties!
 I'm sure abs are at the top of all our fitness plans, which makes this week's exercise a good addition.
 Today's move is an angled crunch.
 It will be working your whole midsection, from upper to lower, and transverse abdominals. All you need is a flat surface and you are ready to crunch.
 Begin this move by laying flat on the floor. Press your back into the floor and roll your hips up to engage the midsection. Draw in one leg by bending in the knee and planting the foot on the floor. Then, extend the opposite leg straight up in the air.
 Now, position the upper body by holding the chest tall with good spacing between the chin and chest. Place the arms as follows: Bent arm with fingertips gently behind your ear, on the same side as the raised leg. The other leg is extended straight and slightly angled across the body.
 Once everything is in place, start to lift the upper body off the floor. Use the straight arm to guide you up and over, reaching for the extended foot. This should create a slight twist in the middle along with the contraction of the midsection. Once you reach your deepest point, return to the start.
 Continue on the same side for at least 10 times. Release your positioning then restructure yourself on the opposite side. Give yourself the same amount of repetitions.
 Continue to alternate your sets from side to side, shooting for at least three sets on each side.
 This exercise is great for all levels. If you need to intensify, flatten out the vent knee. If it is too much for the extended leg, bend that one down to match the other.   This abdominal move is good to add to any routine for variation and extra challenges.

Chief of Army Staff General M M Naravane on Saturday said the country is passing through difficult times and its safety and honour depend on the ability of its young officers as military leaders.
 Addressing gentlemen cadets at the Indian Military Academy here in Dehradun as the reviewing officer of a passing out parade, Gen Naravane said they are being commissioned as officers into the army under the most daunting of circumstances and the high standards of their military training will help them overcome the challenges lying in store for them.
 The parade saw a total of 423 cadets being commissioned into the army including 333 from the country and 90 from friendly foreign countries.
 "These are difficult times for the country. Its safety, honour and respect depend on your abilities as military leaders. You have to live up to the expectations of your countrymen. You have to ensure that whatever you do is for their welfare," he said.
 The army chief said there are no good or bad regiments but only good officers.
 "Become one with your men. Win their trust and affection and they will win battles for you," Naravane said.
 He asked the gentlemen cadets to throw themselves into their new role as commissioned officers with passion but also be compassionate towards their men.
 "When the going gets tough and all seems lost, it is the spirit of your men that helps you win," he said.
 He said the gentlemen cadets who are taking their first step as commissioned officers will have to make decisions in the tactical and operational domain as well as resolve ethical issues and they will have only their conscience to guide them.
 "In such critical moments let the core values enshrined in the preamble of the constitution of India be your guiding light," the Army Chief said.
 Asking them to rise above petty considerations of caste, creed and religion, he said the army does not discriminate.
 Apart from containing the external threats, you may also have to defang internal forces out to destabilise the country.
 He said the precise drill movements of the cadets had convinced him they will do their respective countries proud.
 "In the autumn of your careers what will matter is not the position you finally attain but how honourably you have served your nation," he said.
 In a message to the gentlemen cadets' parents, who were not allowed to attend the event due to the coronavirus pandemic, the Army Chief said, "Till yesterday they (gentlemen cadets) were your children but from tomorrow they will be ours."
 He promised to be with them through thick and thin.
 The parade looked slightly off-colour this time with the enthusiastic crowds of parents and some usual features missing like the showering of the drill square with flower petals by helicopters.

London [UK], June 13 (ANI): Cricket West Indies (CWI) president Ricky Skerritt has said that the England and Wales Cricket Board's (ECB) USD 3 million loan to West Indies was a 'helping hand' in the coronavirus crisis and had nothing to do with the Caribbean side touring England.   All international cricket has been suspended since March due to coronavirus and the series between England-West Indies will mark the return of international cricket.   England will be playing three-match Test series against West Indies behind closed doors beginning from July 8. The matches will be held at Hampshire's Ageas Bowl and Lancashire's Emirates Old Trafford. These two venues have been chosen as bio-secure venues.   "It was just a matter of when the tour would take place and if the ECB could assure the CWI medical experts that the health risk would be minimal to ensure the safety of our players and staff," ESPNCricinfo quoted Skerritt as saying.   "Money had nothing to do with our final decision to make this tour. Holding out a hand for a pay-off is not the way CWI does business," he said.   The apex body of cricket in West Indies had approached the International Cricket Council (ICC) in April 'seeking an advance' of USD 3 million.   "We needed cash urgently. The communication (with ICC) was beginning to look like it would take quite long to be approved and CWI had no other reliable source of cash at that time," said Skerritt.   It was then the CWI president approached the ECB.   "ECB agreed on the basis that ICC would then pay the advance back directly in July. ICC Finance officials were always fully aware of the transparent arrangements and soon became a legal party to the loan agreement," said Skerritt. (ANI)

“More that 200 persons were shaken up when the locomotive and the first six cars of the passenger train were derailed at Milton,” the article said. “Many of the passengers were trapped in the wreckage, where they remained until freed by railroad crews.”
 Reimensnyder, a U.S. Marine Corps veteran who now lives in Mifflinburg, was just 13 years old and living in Milton at the time of the crash.
 He said the crash occurred in the area of the former Milton airport, located just south of the borough in the area of the Milton Historical Society’s Cameron House on Route 405.
 A Scout at the time, Reimensnyder believes he was called to the scene to see what the Scouts could do to assist.
 “When I got there, I was a small, thin fellow,” he said, adding that it was soon realized he was the right size to crawl into a baggage car, to look for survivors.
 “They didn’t want me to do it,” Reimensnyder recalled. “I said ‘I’m going to do it. If they need help, I’m going to do it.’
 “No one else could do it, they weren’t small enough,” he continued. “There were two cars, at least, piled on top of (the baggage car). I went in there, there were dead chickens, and alive chickens.”
 There were no signs of humans in the car. Reimensnyder believes he went in one other car, also a baggage car.
 “I handed chickens out, I remember that, to get them out of the way,” he said. “They let them run loose.”
 Reimensnyder also remembers seeing smoke and steam pouring from the wreckage.
 “In the baggage car, there was no smell, no dead smell,” he said. “It was more like an oil smell.”
 Reimensnyder has always carried the experience of crawling through the wreckage, looking for survivors, with him.
 “That kind of helped me through some other parts of my life, like the Korean War,” he said. “I was experienced with a tragedy and was better able to handle it.”
 While serving in Korea, Reimensnyder had a flashback of crawling through the baggage car.

 “Recognise there will be far-reaching consequences of your actions for Thistle and everyone associated with the club. If that doesn’t matter to you, then focus on doing the right thing for Scottish football. If this vote collapses because people cannot set aside self-interest and ego, our game potentially faces irreparable damage and ongoing division for many years to come.

Mumbai (Maharashtra) [India], June 13 (ANI): Aditya Birla-led Grasim Industries on Saturday reported a consolidated profit after tax of Rs 1,506 crore in the fourth quarter ended March (Q4 FY20), marking a growth of 32 per cent from Rs 1,144 crore in Q4 FY19.   Consolidated revenue for the quarter, however, dropped to Rs 19,902 crore from Rs 22,431 crore in the same period of previous fiscal while consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) dipped to Rs 3,243 crore from Rs 3,999 crore.   Consolidated revenue and EBITDA for the FY20 stood at Rs 77,625 crore and Rs 13,846 crore respectively. Consolidated profit after tax Rs 4,425 crore recorded a growth of 161 per cent year-on-year aided by write-back of deferred tax liabilities and lower exceptional charge in the current year.   On a standalone basis, revenue and EBITDA for FY20 declined on account of general economic slowdown and start of the lockdown in major economies of the world during the month of March, the company said.   Despite the economic slowdown, the company generated net cash flow from operations of Rs 3,519 crore on a standalone basis in FY20 (before meeting its capex spend of over Rs 2,800 crore) on the back of efficient operations and working capital management during the year.   On a standalone basis, the company continues to maintain a comfortable liquidity position with liquid investments of Rs 2,093 crore as on March 31.   The board of directors has recommended a dividend of Rs 4 per share. The total outflow on account of the dividend will be Rs 263 crore.   In terms of the provisions of the Finance Act 2020, dividend will be taxed in the hands of shareholders at applicable rates of tax and the company will withhold tax at source appropriately.   Grasim said it has been in the process of executing total capex plan of Rs 7,800 crore (at standalone level) for raising capacities in both the viscose fibre and chemical businesses apart from ongoing modernisation capex at various plants.   The capex plans are currently being reviewed in the context of the current economic environment.   "With its strong financial, operational excellence and diverse product portfolio (cement, financial services, viscose and chemicals), the company is well poised to withstand temporary disruptions and sustain leadership across its businesses," it said.

Summertime is surely upon us! Between 95-degree days and thunderstorms, it's beach time and pool parties!      I'm sure abs are at the top of all our fitness plans, which makes this week's exercise a good addition.      Today's move is an angled crunch.      It will be working your whole midsection, from upper to lower, and transverse abdominals. All you need is a flat surface and you are ready to crunch.      Begin this move by laying flat on the floor. Press your back into the floor and roll your hips up to engage the midsection. Draw in one leg by bending in the knee and planting the foot on the floor. Then, extend the opposite leg straight up in the air.      Now, position the upper body by holding the chest tall with good spacing between the chin and chest. Place the arms as follows: Bent arm with fingertips gently behind your ear, on the same side as the raised leg. The other leg is extended straight and slightly angled across the body.      Once everything is in place, start to lift the upper body off the floor. Use the straight arm to guide you up and over, reaching for the extended foot. This should create a slight twist in the middle along with the contraction of the midsection. Once you reach your deepest point, return to the start.      Continue on the same side for at least 10 times. Release your positioning then restructure yourself on the opposite side. Give yourself the same amount of repetitions.      Continue to alternate your sets from side to side, shooting for at least three sets on each side.      This exercise is great for all levels. If you need to intensify, flatten out the vent knee. If it is too much for the extended leg, bend that one down to match the other.   This abdominal move is good to add to any routine for variation and extra challenges.

Windstar Cruises, which operates six ships — the largest of which carries 342 passengers — hopes to resume cruises in Tahiti in September. Among other things, the company plans to stagger boarding times to keep passengers apart; expand dining times and space diners out; serve passengers instead of offering buffets; and require crew to wear masks and train them to recognize COVID-19 symptoms.
 Windstar marketing chief Betsy O'Rourke said the company expects demand for 2020 to start picking up soon. Bookings for 2021 are already ahead of where they were this time last year.
 "People who know and love cruising will be back," she said. "They have confidence in us to operate safely."
 But some cruise lovers say they're just not ready.
 Jonathan Adkins is a self-described "cruise junkie" who has been on more than 25 cruises. This year, he and his husband had booked a Caribbean cruise in March and a European cruise in July.
 But the pandemic cooled his enthusiasm. Adkins doesn't want to share tight spaces until there's a COVID-19 vaccine. And he thinks cruise companies have handled the crisis poorly.
 "I'm not comfortable doing business with them for a while," said Adkins, who heads a traffic safety organization in Washington. He doesn't think he'll cruise again until 2022.
 Experts say getting new passengers interested in cruising could be even more daunting. Kishana Taylor, a postdoctoral fellow who studies the influenza virus, was already wary of cruise ships because of norovirus outbreaks. Cruising just doesn't make sense to her, she says, even though she loves the ocean.
 Tara Smith, a professor of epidemiology at Kent State University, says she's not sure how cruises can protect passengers but still be fun. Pools and dance floors can't be too crowded, for example. Even if ships reduce capacity, droplets can spread between passengers. They could test passengers as they get on board, but they would need to get rapid and accurate results.
 "It all seems like a logistical nightmare to me," she said.
 Robert Kwortnik, an associate professor at Cornell University who studies the cruise industry, thinks the industry will make some long-term changes to get back on its feet. Cruise companies will have to make health and safety a major part of their marketing, for example,
 More liberal cancellation policies could also stick. Passengers used to lose their deposit if they canceled within a month of a cruise, he said. Now, companies are allowing them to cancel even two days before. That helps ensure people will cancel if they're sick, he said.
 For now, cruise lines are offering big discounts. Brian McLaren, who leads the cruise division for the Liberty Travel agency, said it's common to see 20 percent discounts or $200 off per person. McLaren said bookings for 2021 cruises are solid, partly because people with cruises this spring have been rebooking.
 Joe Schreck of Jacksonville, Fla., doesn't need convincing. As a workplace health and safety specialist, he says he's seen how well social distancing guidelines can work, and he trusts cruise ships to take the right precautions.
 "Life is too short to worry about stuff like this," he said. "You have to enjoy the time you have."
 He's booked on a cruise to the Bahamas in August.

NEW YORK — Take the stairs, not the elevator, down from your hotel room. Encourage people to bring their own food and drinks to your cookout. Use hand sanitizer after banking at an ATM. Call ahead to restaurants and nail salons to make sure staff are wearing face coverings. And no high-fives — or even elbow bumps — at the gym.
 These are some of the tips in long-awaited guidance from U.S. health officials about how to reduce risk of coronavirus infection for Americans who are attempting some semblance of normal life.
 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention posted the guidelines Friday, along with a second set for organizing and attending big gatherings such as concerts, sporting events, protests and political rallies.
 But the guidelines are "not intended to endorse any particular type of event," the CDC's Dr. Jay Butler said in a Friday call with reporters.
 The staging and attendance of such events should be in accordance with what local health officials are advising, based on much the coronavirus is spreading in a particular community, he added.
 The guidelines are long overdue, some health experts say.
 Julia Marcus, a Harvard Medical School infectious disease researcher, has likened stay-at-home suggestions to "abstinence-only" messaging and has pressed for advice to help people minimize risk. She said she was delighted by the CDC's tips.
 "I think it's a huge step in the right direction," Marcus said. "These guidelines are really directed toward ordinary Americans trying to make decisions about risk every day."
 But there are notable omissions. There's nothing about precautions to take before going to church, no guidance about dating and sex and no explicit advice on a topic that some doctors say they get asked all the time: Is it OK to take the kids to visit grandparents?
 "Visiting grandma is something I must address three times a week," said Dr. William Schaffner, a Vanderbilt University infectious disease expert.
 "My empathy goes out to the CDC. It's very, very difficult to have a precise answer for every circumstance," he added.
 Stay-at-home orders, school shutdowns and business closings were followed by a national flattening in the rate of new cases. In recent weeks, many states have started reopening as they face pressure to get the pandemic-damaged economy going again. And cases are rising in nearly half the states, according to an Associated Press analysis.
 The CDC has put out many sets of guidelines, including some for churches, camps, schools and transit agencies. But until now, the organization hasn't offered specific advice to people trying to decide how to safely do things like take vacations, get their nails done, host barbecues, visit a bank or library, go out to eat or exercise at a gym.
 Other organizations have been trying to fill the void, and some have addressed questions the CDC didn't.
 New York City's health department this week released guidelines for having sex during the coronavirus outbreak. The department advised people to have sex only with those who are close to them, and not with multiple partners. It also suggested washing hands before sex, wearing a mask during it, and said "be creative with sexual positions and physical barriers, like walls, that allow sexual contact while preventing close face to face contact."
 The CDC's director, Dr. Robert Redfield, called his agency's new guidelines "common sense suggestions," not mandates. State or local governments may want to reimpose stricter measures if new outbreaks occur, but that's a call for them to make, CDC officials said.
 The guidelines repeat earlier advice about wearing face coverings, especially if it's difficult to keep at least 6 feet away from other people.
 They also offers a list of questions people should consider before going out, and some things to think about in particular situations. For example, it suggests that house parties be held outside, guests be greeted with a wave instead of a hug and that everyone bring their own food and drinks.

No hesitation on his part.
 “Because of deprivation,” Old School said. “That’s a penalty that was imposed on African American families. Employment opportunities dried up, housing dried up, and they drew a red line straight across the board. People are penalized for the color of their skin … and after the Rodney King riots everyone was labeled a looter or a thief. The image of the African American male is of a thug.”
 The demonstrations and violence across the U.S. since the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer have unleashed more than a few racist outbursts, and that kind of ugliness will never go away. But there’s also been an encouraging multi-racial demand for reforms on many fronts.
 “The collective action and multi-cultural protests give me hope, because nothing will change until … people see that it’s my brother, it’s my last breath, I can’t breathe because he can’t breathe,” said Adams Kellum. “As a Black person, I love seeing that it’s not just us saying this.”

Of particular promise is the company's first-line treatment for multiple myeloma, Empliciti. If the drug successfully completes its ongoing phase 3 trials, it will be positioned to grab market share from long-entrenched competing products.

As Syosset Park Development’s plan began going through the approval process, new community opposition arose, and after a contentious 2018 hearing the town and developer reassessed their options. Saladino had already put a pause on relocating town offices and personnel. In 2019, the developer terminated the sale of the town property and sued Oyster Bay, alleging it had violated the terms of the deal and demanded its money back, plus interest and damages.

In Los Angeles County, African Americans represent 7.9% of the population.
 In the latest homeless count, with double-digit city and county increases that are uniformly disappointing and disturbing, Black people make up 34% of the 66,000-plus total.
 As has been true in other recent years, that is out of whack by four times, and it’s a particularly important number to highlight today, as a reinvigorated national conversation on racial disparities is taking place across the United States.
 “Without institutional racism, there would be 15,000 fewer people experiencing homelessness, almost all coming from Black and Native American populations,” said the summation of county statistics released this week by the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority.

The Center Square) – A committee of Louisiana lawmakers on Wednesday resolved to study law enforcement tactics statewide, though they removed language focusing on the treatment of black citizens by white officers.
 Also on Wednesday, the ACLU of Louisiana announced an attempt to launch an “intensive litigation effort to challenge racially discriminatory policing practices and combat police violence against people of color.”
 In its original form, House Resolution 13 by Baton Rouge Democratic Rep. Ted James referenced the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police, which helped to spur protests worldwide, and called for a study of law enforcement tactics in light of “the deaths of black men at the hands of white police officers.” Republicans objected to that language.

Instead of participating in the graduation ceremony in-person, Smith watched a livestream of his graduation from home June 5 with a handful of family members due to coronavirus precautions.


  The nixed ceremony was the last in a list of canceled high school experiences for the class of 2020, like prom and spring sports. No sweat though.


  “To be honest, I think this experience we’re having right now is actually really fun,” Smith said.


  Senior year started out normal enough. In the fall, he checked off a longtime goal when he earned the rank of Eagle Scout. He’d joined the Boy Scouts at age 11; Eagle Scout is the highest rank one can achieve.


  The final requirement to becoming an Eagle Scout is to organize a community service project. Smith worked with the city of Wenatchee and gathered 15 volunteers to beautify a section of Lions Locomotive Park.


  He estimates he put in 90 or more hours of work between meetings, planning and labor.


  “It’s really demanding: all the planning, all the people you have to talk to approve it was kind of intimidating at times,” Smith said.


  He was also a member, and one-time president, of the Eastmont Drama Club, with roles in “Les Miserables” and “Cinderella.”


  Plans for an all-out celebration never fully developed, but his church, First United Methodist in Wenatchee, organized a drive through parade in its parking lot for three local graduates, including Smith.


  “People honked their horn and said hi, talked for a little bit,” Smith said. “Kind of the closest thing to a grad party I got.”


  It was an act borne out of necessity.


  “Normally that wouldn’t happen,” Smith said. “And actually it was pretty fun. It helped create that cool opportunity. If this was a normal year I wouldn’t have had a drive through parade like that.” Adding, “It was really fun.”


  With high school now a memory, Smith heads to Washington State University next. When the campus will reopen to students, he’s not sure.


  As far as his future studies, nothing’s set in stone but he’s eyeing a degree in basic medical sciences. He wants to study oncology, and with good reason.


  In eighth grade, when he was 13, Smith discovered a lump on the right side of his neck. He was ultimately diagnosed with Stage 1 Hodgkin’s lymphoma and he underwent four months of treatment at Seattle Children’s Hospital.


  “There was a lot of ups and downs,” Smith said.


  His experience with cancer prepared him for life under COVID-19 quarantine — four months in a hospital has some similarities to three months at home.


  “It’s kind of like a blast from the past,” Smith said. “Except everyone’s doing it.”

Bhopal (Madhya Pradesh) [India], June 13 (ANI): The Directorate General of GST Intelligence and Directorate of Revenue Intelligence conducted joint raids at 16 locations of three pan masala and tobacco companies in Madhya Pradesh, in which GST evasions of Rs 225 crores were detected.   "Continuing its crackdown on pan masala/tobacco Goods and Services Tax (GST) evasion prone Sector based in the adversely corona-hit city of Indore in Madhya Pradesh, officers from enforcement Wings of Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC), DGGI and DRI conducted joint raids at 16 suspected illicit and undeclared warehouses and residential locations in Indore and Ujjain from June 9 to June 12," DGGI said in the statement on Saturday.   Despite the COVID-19 situation in Indore, one of the worst-hit cities, the officers displayed great courage and commitment, it said.   According to the statement, the operations codenamed 'Kark' considering GST (Kar) evasion and implication on public health have also led to a seizure of unaccounted finished goods, raw materials, machines and 10 trucks used for the clandestine manufacture of pan masala or tobacco which was being distributed illicitly in Madhya Pradesh and its neighbouring states.   "This operation has led to the detection of GST evasion based on evidence gathered by DGGI amounting to Rs 225 crore for a period of nine 9 months," the statement said.   "In the raids conducted from June 9 to June 12, three independent groups were found to be involved in large scale clandestine manufacture, undeclared supply and illicit sale of pan masala or tobacco without payment of GST have been covered by the enforcement agencies," it added.   It said that three accused persons were also arrested under Section 69 of the CGST Act, 2017 on June 12. the statement added that the undeclared factory premises with as many as 15 machines installed were also unearthed by the CBIC enforcement teams.   "To avoid detection, the masterminds and organizers of this fraud had floated the partnership/ proprietorship/ HUF firms engaged in manufacturing and trading of Pan Masala and Tobacco owned on papers by three dummy persons," DGGI said.   "Certain masterminds of the fraud and financial beneficiaries have not joined investigations. They have been summoned by the Central GST Intelligence Department for tendering statements under the provisions of Central GST Act, 2017," it said. (ANI)

Kristi Williams' Blue Springs South High School softball team has won back-to- back Class 4 state titles, but she admits that she might be as excited to see players on her team Tuesday as she was when they walked off with championship trophies.
   
 "I can't wait to see my girls," Williams said, "it's been like three months, and talking via social media like Zoom just isn't the same thing."
   
 All high school sports in the Blue Springs School District may start outdoor practice on June 15, with social distancing being of utmost importance.
   
 Players will have their temperatures taken, they must bring their own water and they will work in groups of 10 or less.
   
 "We're keeping the same girls in the same groups," Williams said. "A sport like softball will be much easier, I would think, than a sport like football, where there are so many more players."
   
 Williams said the physical activities of the practices will be important, but there are other aspects she is also anticipating.
   
 "Our juniors from last year are going to be our senior leaders this year and that is something we would have been talking about for months, but we missed all that time because of the pandemic," she said.
   
 "But I know our seniors this year are excited and ready to get to work - on and off the field. And we've been lucky because a lot of our girls have been playing softball already.
   
 "They've been able to go to Oklahoma to play and there have been some tournaments in Kansas, too. In fact, there is a big tournament in Kansas this week and a lot of our players will be there."
   
 Williams hopes Tuesday is the first step toward some normalcy, for her players and herself.
   
 "It will be a return to normalcy - I guess what they're calling the new normal, because we can't hug, we can't high-five, we have to keep our social distancing. But at least we'll be able to see each other and talk to each other face to face, and that's what I'm looking forward to."
   
 She paused for a minute, and added, "The only teenager I've been around is my daughter, and she's tired of listening to me. I hope our players are excited about listening to me."

The story of the S.S. Portland is one of the most tragic in New England maritime history. Heading from Boston to Portland, Maine, over Thanksgiving weekend, the steamer was caught in a hurricane-force storm in a raging sea off the Outer Cape, and was never heard from again. Nearly 200 people perished.
 However, this wasn't the first time that a steamer took this route. Nearly a half century earlier, some time between 1850 and 1855, the steamer St. Lawrence was taking the same route, only in the opposite direction.
 Like the Portland, the St. Lawrence was caught in a gale shortly after leaving port. Unlike the Portland, all but one of the 238 souls on board lived to tell about it.
 The Portland was driven out to sea by fierce winds, leaving her struggling near Provincetown before being overtaken by the waves. In the case of the St. Lawrence, it was more by choice that she ended up near Highland Light in Truro.
 Roughly four hours after leaving Portland, the St. Lawrence, captained by Cyrus Sturdivant, found herself caught up in heavy snow and high winds as night fell. By morning, the storm intensified, and Sturdivant and his crew "could not discover the points of land we desired," the captain wrote in his 1879 book, "Sketches of the Life and Work of Captain Cyrus Sturdivant."
 "The only safe and prudent alternative was for us to change the course of our steamer, and lay her off shore, head to the sea and storm, which was constantly increasing in roughness and fierceness."
 By this time, "there was terrible consternation and alarm among some of the passengers," Sturdivant recalled. One of the crewmen was ordered to secure a lifeboat that became loose, and in doing so, his foot slipped, and he fell overboard and was drowned; the sea being so rough and the storm so fierce that no earthly power could save him."
 The situation continued to worsen. The full load of cargo was tossed overboard to lighten the ship's load. The chief engineer told Sturdivant that the main steam pipe might give out and sought instructions on what to do. "Continue to do your duty as you always have done and we will all do the best we can, and so trust in God who holds the storms in his hands," the captain replied.
 The engineer went to the upper deck to attempt a fix. Like many others on board, he dropped to his knees and prayed for help. By evening, "we found ourselves six miles north of the highland of Cape Cod, thankful to God that the gale had become a calm, and so we were saved from finding a watery grave, or being dashed upon the rough shore of the Cape, from whence there would have been no escape," the captain wrote.
 The next day, the St. Lawrence made its way into Boston Harbor. While there was great relief among those on board that the steamer made it through the storm, Sturdivant was still obligated to break the news of the crewman's death to his family. "He whom they loved so well, and on whom they depended for earthly support, would be seen by them no more until the sea gives up its dead," Sturdivant wrote.
 Sturdivant continued to work for the Portland Steam Packet Company for several years, but "finding the life was producing unhealthy symptoms in my constitution, I was advised by my physician to procure and engage in some other other kind of business."
 For the rest of his life, the captain turned to working for the church.
 "Being a sailor, he knew how to cast his net on the right side of the Gospel ship," Francis Murphy wrote in the captain's book introduction. "To the astonishment of many who had fished all night without success, the captain had his net full."

While working on her prerequisites for nursing school, Terry’s parents were both laid off by their employers. It was then Cunningham decided to take a leap and chase her lifelong dream of nursing.
 “My mom was a candy-striper in high school and fell in love with caring for patients,” Terry said. “Even so, she wasn’t sure nursing was something she could accomplish.”
 In support of her mother’s dream, Terry put her own educational journey on hold to help care for her younger siblings. In 2011, Cunningham received her license as a registered nurse.
 “It was the greatest accomplishment I have ever witnessed,” Terry said.
 Cunningham’s success pushed Terry to work hard, study harder and ultimately receive her associate degree in nursing from ACC in December 2018. Terry quickly went to work for Memorial Hermann Southeast in the medical surgical and oncology unit.
 “Since the pandemic began, work has really slowed for my mom,” Terry said. “She was scrolling through job opportunities when she came across one in New York.”
 A few days later, just as Cunningham was furloughed, a recruiter reached out and expressed the need for nurses in the New York area.
 “We were both waiting for that official offer to come through, praying that God’s plan for us would work out,” Terry said. “Days after being notified that my unit would be temporarily closing, we got a call from New Jersey.”
 Terry and Cunningham packed their bags and hit the road. The two drove 1,600 miles from Texas to New Jersey, arriving April 12 and reporting for work the very next day.

The Center Square) – After approving more than $100 million in business tax breaks and incentives Tuesday, a Louisiana House committee advanced a couple more Thursday, though they pumped the brakes on one and even advanced a new tax.
 The discussions echoed those heard throughout this year’s sessions. Skeptics worried about depriving governments of revenue at an uncertain time, while supporters pointed to that same uncertainty to justify boosting businesses that may provide jobs and tax revenue.
 House Bill 52 by Lafayette Republican Rep. Jean-Paul Coussan would increase the state’s software and digital media tax credit incentive from 18 percent of the money invested to 20 percent, though the extra 2 percent would be used for training new employees from targeted demographics such as women, minorities and veterans. It also would expand eligibility for the credit to information technology services and cybersecurity.

Brandon Dail, a user interface engineer in Seattle, wrote on Twitter that he was dismissed for publicly scolding a colleague who had refused to include a statement of support for the Black Lives Matter movement on developer documents he was publishing.
 Dail sent the tweet a day after joining dozens of employees, including the six other engineers on his team, in abandoning their desks and tweeting objections to Zuckerberg's handling of Trump's posts in a rare protest at the social media company.
 "Intentionally not making a statement is already political," Dail wrote in the tweet, sent on Jun 2. He said on Friday that he stood by what he wrote.
 Facebook confirmed Dail's characterisation of his dismissal, but declined to provide additional information. The company said during the walkout that participating employees would not face retaliation.
 Dail did not respond to a request for comment.
 Trump's posts which prompted the staff outcry included the racially charged phrase "when the looting starts, the shooting starts" in reference to demonstrations against racism and police brutality held after the May 25 killing of George Floyd, a black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis.
 Twitter affixed a warning label to the same post, saying it glorified violence. Facebook opted to leave the post untouched.
 Zuckerberg defended his decision at a tense all-hands meeting with employees that week. During the meeting, Dail tweeted that it was "crystal clear today that leadership refuses to stand with us."
 Dail again voiced objections this week after both Facebook and Twitter declined to take action against a Trump post that contained an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory about Martin Gugino, a 75-year-old protester who was critically injured by police in Buffalo, New York.
 "Trump's attack on Martin Gugino is despicable and a clear violation Facebook's anti-harassment rules. It's again extremely disappointing that we (and Twitter) haven't removed it," he said.
