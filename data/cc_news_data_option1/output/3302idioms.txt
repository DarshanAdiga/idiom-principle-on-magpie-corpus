The risk of fraud or mistakes could rise if voters can use third-party contacts to deliver their ballots to election centers in New Jersey, the Republicans alleged.
 "Ballot harvesters are usually politically motivated third parties -- campaign workers, union members, political activists, paid personnel, or volunteers. They go door-to-door and offer to collect and turn in ballots for voters," Republicans wrote in a lawsuit, using the pejorative term "harvesters" for what's typically called ballot collection.
 The contradiction between how the President submitted his ballot and what his party advocates for adds to a list of ways Trump has twisted his public stance to inflame baseless claims of fraud three months before election day.
 Currently, 10 states allow a voter to send in a ballot through a family member, and 26 states allow others to return ballots, such as in Florida, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. And it's an issue that's come up repeatedly in court fights across the country this summer, with Republicans often on the side of limiting ballot collecting.
 The President has railed on Twitter over mail-in voting for weeks -- and even wrote in April "GET RID OF BALLOT HARVESTING, IT IS RAMPANT WITH FRAUD." This month, however, he defended Florida's practices, calling the state's vote by mail process "Safe and Secure, Tried and True."
 A spokesperson for the Trump campaign didn't respond to a request Wednesday for an explanation of how the President's voting and his political position coexist.
 Lawyers for the Democratic Party have made attempts to allow community organizations to collect and deliver completed ballots a cornerstone of their efforts in court this cycle, as they seek to expand people's opportunities to vote by avoiding polling places during the pandemic.
 In Florida, where the Trumps are voting, there are some limits on ballot collections.
 The state allows for any person a voter designates to pick up no more than two mail-in ballots other than their own in an election.
 Progressive groups earlier this year had gone to court to expand ballot collecting so that any person could deliver a ballot on behalf of a voter to election authorities. But Republicans wanted to keep that limited, arguing that a ballot collector touching many ballots could mean they're interested in influence votes.
 Levitt, who studies election cases across the country, noted that the court fights over ballot collecting can mean a great deal to some voters, especially if they're in rural areas, on Native American reservations, or don't speak English as a first language. "You may welcome the assistance … That doesn't mean you have to trust anyone who comes to the door," he said.
 That, he pointed out, is the same type of judgment that President made for himself in Florida. "He's aware of the risk" and trusted Garcia to handle his ballot, Levitt said.

The United States has notified UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres of its decision to trigger a 'snapback' that will initiate restoration of all UN sanctions on Iran, saying Washington will never allow "the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism" to freely buy and sell any kind of conventional weapons.
 Secretary of State Michael Pompeo visited the UN headquarters on Thursday and met Guterres as well as the president of the UN Security Council for the month of August, Indonesian Ambassador Dian Triansyah Djani, to deliver letters notifying them that the US was initiating the restoration of virtually all UN sanctions on Iran lifted under the UN Security Council Resolution 2231. Under this, the sanctions will come back into effect in 30 days from August 20.
 "Our message is very, very simple. The United States will never allow the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism to freely buy and sell planes, tanks, missiles, and other kinds of conventional weapons. These UN sanctions will continue the arms embargo," Pompeo told reporters at the UN.
 He said the "restored sanctions will also reimpose accountability for other forms of Iranian malign activity that the authors of the nuclear deal foolishly downplayed. Iran will be again prohibited from ballistic missile testing. Iran will be back under sanctions for ongoing nuclear activities such as the enrichment of nuclear material that could be applied to a nuclear weapons programme".
 Last week, the US had suffered a diplomatic defeat when the UN Security Council rejected a proposal by Washington to indefinitely extend an arms embargo on Iran. The Trump Administration had threatened that it would initiate a "snapback" to reimpose all UN sanctions on Iran.
 US President Donald Trump had in May 2018 pulled the US out of the 2015 landmark nuclear deal with Iran, an Obama-era accord which he has repeatedly criticised as "disastrous", and re-imposed sanctions.
 The US was joined by the Dominican Republic in favor of the proposal to extend the Iranian arms embargo, which expires on October 18. Russia and China had voted against, while all other council members, including France, Germany, the UK, Indonesia and South Africa, had abstained.
 US Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Kelly Craft had said that the under Resolution 2231, the US has every right to initiate snapback of provisions of previous Security Council resolutions. "In the coming days, the United States will follow through on that promise to stop at nothing to extend the arms embargo."
 The so-called "snapback" mechanism, which was envisioned in the 2015 nuclear deal, would restore all UN sanctions on Iran if it was found that Tehran was in violation of the accord.
 Pompeo said Germany, France, and the United Kingdom the E3 had told him "privately that they don't want the arms embargo lifted either" yet they have provided no alternatives or options.
 "No country but the United States had the courage and conviction to put forward a resolution. Instead, they chose to side with ayatollahs. Their actions endanger the people of Iraq, Yemen, Lebanon, Syria and indeed, their own citizens as well," he said.
 In a statement, the foreign ministers of France, Germany and the UK said the US has requested to initiate the "snapback" mechanism, which allows a participant to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPoA) to seek the reimposition against Iran of the multilateral sanctions lifted in 2015 in accordance with resolution 2231, adopted by the UN Security Council.
 They said the US ceased to be a participant to the JCPoA following their withdrawal from the deal on May 8, 2018. "We cannot support this action which is incompatible with our current efforts to support the JCPoA," the statement said.
 The E3 called on all UNSC members to refrain from any action that would only deepen divisions in the Security Council or have serious adverse consequences on its work.
 "We remain committed to the JCPoA despite the significant challenges caused by US withdrawal. We believe that we should address the current issue of systematic Iranian non-compliance with its JCPoA obligations through dialogue between JCPoA participants, including through the Joint Commission and use of the Dispute Resolution Mechanism.
 "In order to preserve the agreement, we urge Iran to reverse all measures inconsistent with its nuclear commitments and return to full compliance without delay," the E3 ministers said.
 They added that they have serious concerns regarding the implications for regional security of the scheduled expiry of the UN conventional arms embargo, "particularly given Iran's destabilising activities, which continue unabated".
 Pompeo said Trump and his administration have discarded the "fiction" that the regime merely seeks a peaceful nuclear program.
 "We will never allow the Islamic Republic of Iran to have a nuclear weapon. Our actions today too should come as no surprise to anyone. Our team has made every diplomatic effort over now almost two years to renew this arms embargo," he said.
 He added that the American leadership begins with "recognising the Islamic Republic of Iran for what it truly is: a theocratic, revolutionary, brutish regime that will not voluntarily seek peace or make life better for the Iranian people".
 "The one-sided, foolish nuclear deal did not bring security for America, it did not bring stability to the Middle East, nor did it moderate the regime's behaviour." Pompeo added that the US decision puts additional pressure on Iran to behave like a normal country and to come back to the bargaining table.
 "We call on the international community to join us in crafting a stronger deal that addresses the full range of Iran's malign behaviour and protects people of all nations that simply want to live free from Iranian predation," he said.

Commercial vehicle manufacturers are expected to incur a massive net loss to the tune of ₹6,000 crore in the current financial year, with the volume likely to touch its lowest point in a decade after two consecutive years of high de- growth, Ratings agency Crisil said on Thursday.
 In the April-June period of financial year 2021, as per data, the total CV (commercial vehicle) sale in the country stood at 31,636, a decline of 85 per cent year-on-year as the country remained in the coronavirus-induced lockdown for most part of the June quarter and, most of the trade and business activities coming to a temporary halt.
 A 30 per cent decline in sales volume on an already weak base would lead to a nearly six-fold increase in a net loss to ₹6,000 crore for commercial vehicle (CV) makers this fiscal, Crisil Ratings said in the release.
 “Two consecutive years of high de-growth are likely to result in CV volume reaching its lowest point in 10 years. With utilisation down to a third, high fixed costs would dent the profitability of CV makers, " said Manish Gupta, Senior Director, Crisil Ratings.
 Last time, in 2009-10, the total commercial vehicle sale in the country had clocked 5,33,000 units.
 Noting that commercial vehicles are a critical logistical link to the economy, it said a quick recovery in sales volume is critical as a slower rebound can elongate the pain for manufacturers.
 According to Crisil, the CV makers were already hit by new overloading norms and a slowing economy when the Covid-19 pandemic arrived, and sales volume had fallen 29 per cent in the fiscal year ended March 2020.
 In the first quarter of this fiscal, volume plunged another 85 per cent because of the pandemic-driven lockdown, it said.
 "The resultant sharp slowdown in industrial activity has hard-braked sales of medium and heavy commercial vehicles (MHCVs), which account for two-thirds of the industry revenue. Sales of light commercial vehicles (LCVs) may fare better with support from the rural economy and private consumption," Crisil stated.
 Noting that the situation could constrain credit metrics in the current fiscal, the ratings agency said that the credit profiles of manufacturers will be supported by strong balance sheets and comfortable cash buffers
 Moreover, manufacturers may partly absorb BS 6 upgrade costs in their quest to stimulate demand. That could drive down segment operating margins to near-zero from an already low 6 per cent in fiscal 2020, and increase losses, said Gupta.
 Cash flows may stretch further as manufacturers will tend to support key stakeholders to reduce stress across the value chain and help them rebound next fiscal – such as by providing dealers leeway on payment terms and making timely payments to auto-component suppliers, Crisil said.
 However, that would temporarily increase the working capital requirements and raise the industry's debt by almost a third to ₹40,000 crore this fiscal, it said.
 Consequently, credit metrics of the sector would be constrained, but credit profiles will be supported by strong balance sheets and expectation of a bounce-back next fiscal, it added.
 “The pandemic struck when the industry's gearing was 0.5 times – a shade lower than the year before the previous downturn in 2014. Despite the rise, we expect the gearing to be comfortable at 0.7 times by the end of the current fiscal.
 "Besides, manufacturers also have comfortable cash liquidity of nearly two times debt servicing needs," said Naveen Vaidyanathan, Associate Director, Crisil Ratings,
 According to Crisil while rising debt and weak profitability may constrain interest cover to nearly 1.5 times this fiscal from an average 7.1 times in the past five years, the number should recover next year with sales volume.
 The recovery is predicated on an expected pick-up in both industrial activity and private consumption, said the release adding commercial vehicles are a critical logistical link to the economy and hence sales volume is likely to bounce back next fiscal to reach almost fiscal 2020 level.
 That would substantially pull up the profitability of manufacturers, reverse the working capital stretch and restore credit metrics, it said.

In Game 5, Canadiens forward Jesperi Kotkaniemi’s hit on Travis Sanheim led to some stitches and a major penalty and ejection. Philadelphia defenseman Matt Niskanen’s stick also got up in Brendan Gallagher’s face and broke his jaw.
 The Canadiens ruled out Gallagher for the rest of the series because he needs to leave the Toronto bubble for surgery. It’s a big loss for Montreal; associate coach Kirk Muller called Gallagher “the heartbeat of our team.”
 Niskanen was suspended for Game 6 (7 p.m. EDT, NBC Sports Network) after the NHL’s department of player safety determined he was reckless with his stick but did not intend to hit Gallagher in the face. Vigneault called it “a hockey play.”
 Even without Gallagher, there’s still plenty of fight left in the Canadiens, the 12th seed in the Eastern Conference who knocked out Pittsburgh in the qualifying round and keep fighting back after falling behind 3-1 to Philadelphia. Tensions being up in this series for big hits, questionable ones, some post-whistle kerfuffles and even 21-year-old budding star Nick Suzuki patting Flyers goalie Carter Hart on the head after giving up a bad goal.
 Desperation only brings the best out of Montreal’s young group.

Who cares what they did, who cares what we did, but I’m pretty sure next game’s going to be a good one.”
 That’s one thing the Canadiens and Flyers agree on.

The United States has notified UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres of its decision to trigger a 'snapback' that will initiate restoration of all UN sanctions on Iran, saying Washington will never allow &quot;the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism&quot; to freely buy and sell any kind of conventional weapons.Secretary of State Michael Pompeo visited the UN headquarters on Thursday and met Guterres as well as the president of the UN Security Council for the month of August, Indonesian Ambassador Dian Triansyah Djani, to deliver letters notifying them that the US was initiating the restoration of virtually all UN sanctions on Iran lifted under the UN Security Council Resolution 2231.&amp;nbsp;Under this, the sanctions will come back into effect in 30 days from August 20.&quot;Our message is very, very simple. The United States will never allow the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism to freely buy and sell planes, tanks, missiles, and other kinds of conventional weapons. These UN sanctions will continue the arms embargo,&quot; Pompeo told reporters at the UN.He said the &quot;restored sanctions will also reimpose accountability for other forms of Iranian malign activity that the authors of the nuclear deal foolishly downplayed. Iran will be again prohibited from ballistic missile testing. Iran will be back under sanctions for ongoing nuclear activities such as the enrichment of nuclear material that could be applied to a nuclear weapons programme&quot;.Last week, the US had suffered a diplomatic defeat when the UN Security Council rejected a proposal by Washington to indefinitely extend an arms embargo on Iran. The Trump Administration had threatened that it would initiate a &quot;snapback&quot; to reimpose all UN sanctions on Iran.US President Donald Trump had in May 2018 pulled the US out of the 2015 landmark nuclear deal with Iran, an Obama-era accord which he has repeatedly criticised as &quot;disastrous&quot;, and re- imposed sanctions.The US was joined by the Dominican Republic in favor of the proposal to extend the Iranian arms embargo, which expires on October 18. Russia and China had voted against, while all other council members, including France, Germany, the UK, Indonesia and South Africa, had abstained.US Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Kelly Craft had said that the under Resolution 2231, the US has every right to initiate snapback of provisions of previous Security Council resolutions. &quot;In the coming days, the United States will follow through on that promise to stop at nothing to extend the arms embargo.&quot;The so-called &quot;snapback&quot; mechanism, which was envisioned in the 2015 nuclear deal, would restore all UN sanctions on Iran if it was found that Tehran was in violation of the accord.Pompeo said Germany, France, and the United Kingdom the E3 had told him &quot;privately that they don't want the arms embargo lifted either&quot; yet they have provided no alternatives or options.&quot;No country but the United States had the courage and conviction to put forward a resolution. Instead, they chose to side with ayatollahs. Their actions endanger the people of Iraq, Yemen, Lebanon, Syria and indeed, their own citizens as well,&quot; he said.In a statement, the foreign ministers of France, Germany and the UK said the US has requested to initiate the &quot;snapback&quot; mechanism, which allows a participant to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPoA) to seek the reimposition against Iran of the multilateral sanctions lifted in 2015 in accordance with resolution 2231, adopted by the UN Security Council.They said the US ceased to be a participant to the JCPoA following their withdrawal from the deal on May 8, 2018. &quot;We cannot support this action which is incompatible with our current efforts to support the JCPoA,&quot; the statement said.The E3 called on all UNSC members to refrain from any action that would only deepen divisions in the Security Council or have serious adverse consequences on its work.&quot;We remain committed to the JCPoA despite the significant challenges caused by US withdrawal. We believe that we should address the current issue of systematic Iranian non-compliance with its JCPoA obligations through dialogue between JCPoA participants, including through the Joint Commission and use of the Dispute Resolution Mechanism.&quot;In order to preserve the agreement, we urge Iran to reverse all measures inconsistent with its nuclear commitments and return to full compliance without delay,&quot; the E3 ministers said.They added that they have serious concerns regarding the implications for regional security of the scheduled expiry of the UN conventional arms embargo, &quot;particularly given Iran's destabilising activities, which continue unabated&quot;.Pompeo said Trump and his administration have discarded the &quot;fiction&quot; that the regime merely seeks a peaceful nuclear program.&quot;We will never allow the Islamic Republic of Iran to have a nuclear weapon. Our actions today too should come as no surprise to anyone. Our team has made every diplomatic effort over now almost two years to renew this arms embargo,&quot; he said.He added that the American leadership begins with &quot;recognising the Islamic Republic of Iran for what it truly is: a theocratic, revolutionary, brutish regime that will not voluntarily seek peace or make life better for the Iranian people&quot;.&quot;The one-sided, foolish nuclear deal did not bring security for America, it did not bring stability to the Middle East, nor did it moderate the regime's behaviour.&quot;&amp;nbsp;Pompeo added that the US decision puts additional pressure on Iran to behave like a normal country and to come back to the bargaining table.&quot;We call on the international community to join us in crafting a stronger deal that addresses the full range of Iran's malign behaviour and protects people of all nations that simply want to live free from Iranian predation,&quot; he said.

As the narrative opens, it takes viewers to a time when land was free, then introduces them to a time when land became a matter of rights and power. Dharavi as a place which shelters many people across castes, religions and languages, seems to inherit this history as well as the story of land when it was free and when it started becoming a matter of power and subsequently rights, for the masses.

With her help, DAR divers conducted an initial assessment of the net and what it would take to remove it from the reef. Later a full removal operation was conducted that involved five DAR employees and nine community volunteers. DAR free divers worked to cut the net and remove it from the reef, careful to minimize damage to corals and live rock. Volunteers shuttled the net pieces back to shore and into a truck. LightSUP Hawai‘i and Hawai‘i Surf and Kayak donated the use of stand-up paddleboards and kayaks for the operation. The removal team estimated that over 1,000 pounds of netting were taken off of the reef over a four-hour period.

Like a dog chasing a car, I don't think Epic Games really knew what it was doing when it decided to go to war with Apple and Google last week.
 It all started Aug. 13 when Epic Games, the developer and publisher of the insanely popular game "Fortnite," announced they would start offering a permanent 20% discount on "Fortnite's" in-game currency if the player would buy directly from Epic rather than the Apple or Google app stores.
 Apple and Google, who both collect a 30% fee on all in-app purchases immediately balked at this and pulled the game from their stories.
 Epic Games expected that and lawsuits against Apple and Google were already written waiting to be filed as soon as the game had been pulled from the app stores. Epic even released a video to go along with the lawsuit that is a parody of Apple's "1984" Super Bowl commercial, but this time casting Apple in the villain role instead of IBM.
 "Apple's removal of 'Fortnite' is yet another example of Apple flexing its enormous power in order to impose unreasonable restraints and unlawfully maintain its 100% monopoly over the iOS in-app payment processing market," Epic said in its complaint, which was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.
 Epic is clearly trying to sway public opinion that they're good guys looking out for consumers while Apple and Google are just trying to milk hardworking companies by taking exorbitant fees on purchases made on their app stores.
 While Epic was expecting "Fortnite" to get pulled from the app stories, I don't think they were expecting the continued escalation of the fight this week.
 On Aug. 24, Apple announced it had plans to revoke Epic Games' software development capabilities for all Apple products on Aug. 28, making Epic Games' popular Unreal Engine, used to make games, movies/television shows, theme park attractions and other industries, incompatible with any Apple product.
 Epic Games filed a preliminary injunction and a temporary restraining order against Apple on Aug. 24 that would prevent "Fortnite" from being removed from the iOS app store and keep the Unreal Engine from being incompatible with Apple hardware.
 As a creator and lover of all kinds of media, I absolutely believe that all content creators should be given a fair payment for their work.
 But I also believe in fair business. Since the safer at home recommendations started in mid-March due to the coronavirus pandemic, my wife and I have been rewatching the classic CBS drama "Dallas." Signing a contract agreeing to split the proceeds 70/30 and then finding a way to cheat the system after you've become successful so you don't have to pay your partner sounds like something J.R. Ewing would have taken pleasure in 40 years ago. And if your business model is something J.R. Ewing would approve of, it's probably not entirely on the up and up.

CORNING | Speaking Wednesday outside the Post Office on Corning's Baker Street, U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., criticized recent changes at the U.S. Postal Service for their impact not only on the upcoming election, but on thousands of Southern Tier postal workers and the largely rural residents they serve.
   
 "We need the post office all the time, because it delivers such essential things -- but during COVID, we need it even more," Schumer said. "Senior citizens can't go to the drug store, and they need their medications. Eighty percent of our veterans' medications are mailed by the VA through the post office.
   
 "Yet during the COVID crisis, a new Postmaster General, (Louis) DeJoy, is trying to dismantle the post office, plain and simple."
   
 Schumer was joined by local postal workers representing the National Association of Letter Carriers union, including Tracy Nist, of NALC Local 300 in Corning, and a veteran.
   
 "In addition to my military service, I have just over a quarter of a century working for our government," Nist told the gathered supporters. "The post office employs more than 97,000 veterans, and is one of the largest veteran employers in the country.
   
 "Backing the post office also means backing our veterans."
   
 Schumer, echoing criticisms coming from Democrats in the House now holding hearings on the issue, said changes at the Postal Service that DeJoy and others justified as "cost-cutting" have crippled the organization's operations.
   
 Schumer cited the shutdown and dismantling of sorting machines, removal of postal drop boxes in locations around the country, elimination of overtime for workers and cutting postal jobs, largely through attrition (not replacing retiring workers or those who leave for other reasons).
   
 Schumer noted that the U.S. Postal Service employs 3,906 workers in the Southern Tier.
   
 "These are good-paying jobs," he added.
   
 Schumer didn't steer clear of the political side of the Postal Service fight.
   
 "I believe (Postmaster General) DeJoy, egged on by (President Donald Trump), wants to destroy the post office," Schumer said.
   
 He believes the main target is voting by mail in the November election.
   
 "Our elections are sacred -- millions of men and women from across the country have risked their lives so we will have free and fair elections," Schumer said. "If people doubt their election, because they won't get their absentee ballots in, because when they mail in a request for a ballot it comes too late, that's the beginning of the end of this grand experiment in democracy."
   
 DeJoy said on Tuesday he would hold off on further changes until after the November election.
   
 Schumer has said that the changes must be reversed now, and has asked the Postmaster General to respond to his concerns specifically and in writing.
   
 The Postal Service has struggled financially in recent years, leading to calls for reductions in costs. But the budget shortfalls are widely considered the result of a 2006 law requiring the organization to prepay billions of dollars for retiree benefits in a way other agencies and businesses don't have to.
   
 Schumer said repealing that requirement would be a major boon to the organization -- but he didn't respond directly when asked why lawmakers hadn't fought for a repeal over the past 14 years.

With COVID-19 cases on the rise in California, the virus is uppermost in the minds of many East County residents.
 With reports the virus was running rampant in the U.S. as early as November, many wonder if they can attribute that nagging cough over Christmas or the severe, flu-like symptoms they had in January to coronavirus. Antibody tests aren’t foolproof and medical experts cannot agree if having the virus once creates immunity.
 One East County real estate agent has run the gauntlet, with a positive COVID-19 test and a month of aches, pains and stomach issues. Heidy Hurst and her husband, Todd, both fell victim to it at the end of June and lost the entire month of July to quarantine and recovery.
 “The final week of July, I finally started to come together, to feel like I was going to be ok,” Hurst said. “I was fatigued and disoriented from the dehydration, and my body was exhausted. It took a long time, just trying to get your mind back to normal. And the weakness, it took a long time to get my body back to its normal strength.”
 Hurst said Todd began to feel sick at the end of June, on Father’s Day. She took him to get tested for COVID-19 on Monday, June 22, and received his results – positive – on Wednesday. At that point, Hurst decided to get tested, as well.
 “I went Wednesday, and got my results on Friday, and they were negative,” Hurst recalled. “Then, Friday night, I was talking to my sister on the phone, late, and I thought I wasn’t going to get it, and I did, and I got it worse than my husband.”
 After her phone conversation, Hurst said she felt a heaviness on her back. Within minutes, she had the chills, fever and a sinus headache.
 “I was fine, and then, boom, I was just sick,” said Hurst. “I actually had a horrible sinus headache that was unbearable, I think that was the worst part, in the very beginning. The aches were so bad, it was absolutely radiating through my body, even just touching my fingers hurt, everything hurt so badly.”
 To this day, the Hursts still don’t know where or how they contracted the virus. Though her test on Wednesday was negative, the results could have been inaccurate, or she could have picked it up sometime after her test appointment and before Friday night. Hurst’s work, and her husband’s business as a plumber, brings them into contact with people often, and tracing the origin of their infection is difficult.
 Hurst stayed home and suffered in bed for almost two weeks. On Wednesday morning, June 10, a video appointment with her doctor ended with a recommendation she go into the emergency room.
 “I told my doctor I felt terrible, and could barely breathe and was weak,” Hurst said. “He said he wanted me to go to the ER, and I hate going to the hospital, but Todd looked at me and said, you really need to go in, things aren’t going good for you, so he brought me in and they tested me again, and it was positive.”
 At this point, the virus had morphed into pneumonia, filling Hurst’s lungs with fluid and making it difficult to breathe. Though her sinus headache had abated thanks to an antibiotic prescription, she had a constant sensation of cotton in her lungs, stomach cramps and a persistent case of diarrhea, causing dehydration and exhaustion.
 “It never ends with this virus,” Hurst explained. “It hits you so hard with the fever, the chills, everything you can imagine. I didn’t have a cough, but I had this heaviness on my back, which Todd didn’t, and then that turned into pneumonia.”
 Hurst spent one full day in the hospital, then returned home, where she spent another two weeks in bed before the virus began to let up. Initially a health- conscious person who worked out five days a week, by the time coronavirus finished with her, Hurst said she could barely walk around her house. It was August before she felt up to some light exercise.
 As she and Todd ease into their new normal after recovery, Hurst said one big change for her is her willingness to order things online and skip the store, a personal experience she took great pleasure in previously.
 “I’m so afraid of getting it again,” admitted Hurst. “I ask my doctors and nurses if there is proof I can’t get it again, and they told me it’s unlikely, but it’s not to say you can’t. This was probably the worst month of my life.”

Law360 (August 20, 2020, 9:34 PM EDT) -- The Trump administration is trying to throw cold water on environmentalists' request to halt an overhaul of a cornerstone environmental review law from taking effect while the groups countered that the changes will cause immediate harm and its request should be quickly considered.      The government, defending the White House Council on Environmental Quality's move to streamline the National Environmental Policy Act, told the court Wednesday the rule changes should take effect in mid-September as scheduled. That response came a day after Defenders of Wildlife and several environmental groups asked to speed up briefing and halt the NEPA changes before they go...

In his first-ever trip to Jennerstown, Bonsignore won the first race at the track, the Morocco Welding-Wade Cole Memorial 133, after starting in the pole position and leading from start to finish.
 Six-time Whelen Tour champion Doug Coby will also be racing on Saturday night. Coby, who is second in the tour points standings, was victorious in the last Whelen Tour race at White Mountain Motorsports Park in Woodstock, New Hampshire.
 The Laurel Highlands 150 will be streamed live on NBC Track Pass, and will also be shown on MSNBC Sports on Aug. 31 at 3 p.m. Hribar said hosting races like the Whelen Tour is helping Jennerstown Speedway gain more recognition from the public.
 “It’s been great across the board,” Hribar said. “The ability to get national attention from the tour by them tweeting and posting about us is a tremendous help. When you factor in COVID, it’s been remarkable. We did a lot better than expected. I know myself and everyone at the speedway are very thankful.”
 Prior to the Whelen race, drivers from the Martella’s Pharmacies Late Models division will compete in a 30-lap feature. The race will be important for the final points standings as only five weeks remain in the season, and the top three spots are separated by a difference of just 10 points.
 Jenners’ Barry Awtey sits atop the standings with 320 points. Awtey finished in the top 10 of all five feature races and has four top five finishes. Teddy Gibala is in second with 315 points, and Albert Francis, the only repeat winner in the division, sits in third with 310.
 Somerset’s Garry Wiltrout and Jarred Barclay and Stoystown’s Mike Hemminger are currently in fourth, fifth and sixth place, respectively. Wiltrout earned a victory in Week 1.
 “These guys know that it’s coming down to the wire and every race is important,” Hribar said. “There’s going to be more of an emphasis in the coming races on top five or top three finishes to get points. It’s going to be a great final stretch to see who comes out on top.”

Highland, barring a late twist in the plot — and in 2020, who wouldn't see that coming — will be one of the first teams in Idaho to play a high school football game this fall when the Rams host Thunder Ridge at Iron Horse Stadium on Friday night.
 It's a game that contains multitudes both on and off the field — an early- season conference clash between two 5A hopefuls, an exhalation of relief for the players and coaches after a pins-and-needles summer, and a trial balloon for high school athletics across the state this fall.
 "We're the very first ones, so it's going to be different how we handle the sidelines," Highland head coach Gino Mariani said. "We don't know how much we'll have to be on kids. We'll talk to them about keeping social distance, having their masks on when they're out. There's a lot more that we have to prepare for and talk to kids about. ... (But) it feels great. We want to play, and we're going to get the first game in."
 The matchup, like everything else in athletics across the country this year, has already been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic that remains stubbornly present in the United States.
 Highland was originally scheduled to play Mountain View in the so-called "Week 0" game, while Thunder Ridge had Rocky Mountain on its schedule.
 But when Boise-area schools were forced to push back their seasons because of the novel coronavirus, both opponents had to drop out, leaving Highland and Thunder Ridge with a natural solution.
