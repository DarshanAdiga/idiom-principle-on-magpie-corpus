Anti-government protests resume in Iraq after bloodshedActivists killingA female activist was killed on Wednesday and three others wounded when unidentified gunmen opened fire on their car in the southern&nbsp;Iraqi city of Basra, security and health sources told Reuters.It was the third incident this week in which gunmen targeted an anti-government political activist, after one activist was killed and four others had their car fired upon in a separate incident.Reham Yacoub was gunned down on Wednesday by assault rifle brandishing gunmen on the back of a motorcycle, the sources told Reuters. She was an activist in the local protest movement since 2018 and had led several women&#39;s marches.The recent wave of violence begun when activist Tahseen Osama was assassinated on Friday, prompting a return of street demonstrations for three days in which security forces opened live fire on protesters who lobbed the governor&#39;s house with rocks and petrol bombs and blocked several main roads.Prime Minister Mustafa al Kadhimi subsequently sacked the Basra police and national security chiefs on Monday and ordered an investigation into the violence which calmed protesters down.&ldquo;It seems that there is a well-programmed cleansing of activists who were influential in the last protest movement,&rdquo; said Ali al Bayati, spokesman for the semi- official Iraqi Independent High Commission for Human Rights.Bayati said the government was also complicit in the killings because of its &ldquo;silence&rdquo; and &ldquo;inability to take real action to stop it.&rdquo; According to the commission, there have been six assassination attempts targeting activists, with two killed in Basra in the month of August alone. That represents a jump as the commission recorded 16 attempted targeted killings in the 10 months after the uprising started in October.A recent government investigation said 560 protesters and security forces were killed during the October movement. The probe drew criticism from activists who said it fell short of naming the perpetrators, who are widely suspected of having links to Iran-backed militia groups.Kadhimi fired the Basra police chief on Monday and ordered a new probe into the killing of Osama.READ MORE:

Lots of factors make California burn so much, and people figure in many. The area burned in California has increased fivefold since the 1970s, and the wildfires are happening again now. Climate change makes fuel more dry and burn easier. Invasive grasses introduced by people catch fire easily. People often are in the way and at risk in the nation’s most populous state. And people provide more than 90% of the sparks that start California’s wildfires. In the end, scientists say California has a really flammable ecosystem and global warming is making it worse.

FOX NEWS) -- He's not a third-party presidential candidate up for election in November, but thousands across the country are putting up "Jesus 2020" yard signs.
 More than 5,000 signs have shipped out to California, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, and other states from a campaign that began at Sampey Memorial Baptist Church in Ramer, Ala.
 "People need Jesus with everything that's going on," Joyce Hubbard, one of the Jesus 2020 co-organizers, told Fox News. "He's the only one that we can count on. He's the one that keeps his promises. He's already the winner."
 Hubbard and her friend, Martha Sikes, came up with the idea at their small church, which reopened in May and has several members still at home due to the coronavirus pandemic. The two wanted to spark a revival of hope in a climate of despair.
 "If everyone would just focus on Jesus right now, everything would just fall into place and we wouldn't have the problems we have," Hubbard said. "He's the only way."
 People from all over the country have been ordering signs at the JESUS 2020 Facebook Page and they've been printed at Wells Printing in Montgomery.
 "We don't have to be some megachurch. All it takes is a spark and we want to set fires everywhere," Hubbard said. "We want Jesus's name out there."
 The organizers said they've had churches and entire neighborhoods order the signs because, Hubbard notes, "once one person gets them, everyone wants one."
 "It's been awesome! It's uplifted people so much," Hubbard said. "People are just looking for something to cling onto. Not the signs itself, but just Jesus. I mean that's what we need."

Their way of squaring that circle has been by ignoring the scientific fact of the humanity of the unborn child. Since, however, they have systematically detached morality from the real (the humanity) in favor of the intention (the choice), they cannot evade the fact that their "choice" is driven by a tainted, discriminatory criterion].

El canciller Mario López Chávarri designó como asesor ad honorem de su despacho ministerial al excongresista de Fuerza Popular Juan Carlos del Águila Cárdenas, quien fue parte del Parlamento disuelto el 30 de setiembre del 2019. En diálogo con El Comercio, el excongresista del fujimorismo confirmó su designación y señaló que se trató de “un llamado del propio canciller”. “Nos conocemos de hace algunos años cuando fui presidente de la Comisión de Relaciones Exteriores del Congreso”, añadió. Según dijo, su función será “dar algunas apreciaciones en cuanto a temas de integración y desarrollo fronterizo, especialmente en la Amazonía peruana”. “No tiene que ver necesariamente con el tema de (Acuerdo de) Escazú. Si el canciller me pide opinión sobre eso, por supuesto. Yo soy de Loreto y todo lo que tenga que ver con la Amazonía, y en particular con Loreto, con mucho gusto”, expresó. La resolución ministerial publicada este jueves en el diario oficial El Peruano precisa que los asesores de Alta Dirección, sean remunerados o ad honorem, ejercen las “mismas funciones, gozan de las mismas atribuciones y se encuentran sometidos a idéntica responsabilidad en el ejercicio de sus funciones”. La resolución ministerial 478-2020-RE, firmada por López Chávarri, detalla que “por razones del servicio”, resulta necesario designar a Del Águila como “asesor ad honorem del Despacho Ministerial de Relaciones Exteriores”. Del Águila Cárdenas fue presidente de la Comisión de Relaciones Exteriores en el periodo legislativo del 2016 al 2017 y vicepresidente de la Comisión de Energía y Minas el año siguiente, entre otros cargos. También fue vocero alterno de la bancada naranja. Mario López Chávarri fue designado como canciller de la República como parte del gabinete de Pedro Cateriano desde el 15 de julio de este año. Luego fue ratificado por el actual primer ministro Walter Martos.

As the shooting started the father tried to speed away but crashed into a tree, and the suspect took off from the scene. The father was shot several times, and was flown to U of L Hospital in serious condition. His wife was also shot and taken to the hospital.
 Neighbors who heard the gunshots and crash ran to the nearby home of a police officer to get help. Mark Bye, a school resource officer in Corydon, was the first person to render aid to the victims.
 "Mom had a wound on her left side, in her stomach area," Bye said. "Dad had multiple wounds, some in the arm, some in the side, and I believe one in the leg."
 The couple's 16-year-old daughter wasn't hit by gunfire, but was taken to the hospital.
 Bye says he wasn't sure what to expect when neighbors knocked on his door to ask for help.
 "When you go to the scene you really never know what you're getting into. You can be told 'hey this happened here, but you really know what the whole story is," Bye said. "I live right there, I'm in O'Bannon Woods State Park all the time. I had just went up there and ran on a trail just a few hours before this. You just never know when it's going to happen or where it's going to happen."
 Investigators say they do not know why the family was attacked, but believe it may have been a case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time.
 The car the suspect was driving -- a white Dodge Avenger -- was later found in a cornfield approximately 15 miles away, near Carefree, Indiana. ISP Sgt. Carey Huls tells WDRB the suspect then stole a silver 2000 Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck from a nearby home.

BALLWIN, Mo. (AP) — The national conventions are typically loud, boisterous and chaotic with thousands of people crammed shoulder-to-shoulder. In the coronavirus era, such gatherings are out of the question, so the Democrats are gathered virtually this week, rather than in Milwaukee, to nominate former Vice President Joe Biden and his running mate, California Sen. Kamala Harris. Millions of people are still watching — at home, on Zoom watch parties, even from cars and SUVs at drive-in movie-like viewing stations. From delegates to regular people, observers generally give the virtual format high marks but say it takes some getting used to.

Blanes, por su parte, evita cualquier enfrentamiento con su madre aunque reitera no haber perdido el rumbo. Insiste en que la herencia de su padre, de la que recibió algo más de seis millones de euros, tres propiedades, una sociedad que su padre fundó en 1990 para albergar actividades de grabación de sonido y edición musical y los derechos de autor de todas las canciones que compuso el artista, no le ha cambiado ni lo va a hacer. Pero los hechos no dicen lo mismo y parece que le está resultando difícil gestionar el patrimonio recibido. El chalé de Torrelodones de su padre, en el que el joven reside desde que regresó a España, está muy deteriorado. Blanes ha despedido al matrimonio que trabajaba para Camilo Sesto y la finca se muestra ahora muy abandonada con bastante suciedad acumulada en el jardín y en la piscina.
