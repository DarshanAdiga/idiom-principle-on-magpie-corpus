I only take on projects that I am passionate about and feel that I can contribute to as a collaborator, not just as an author or editor. As I say, If you just want someone to tell you where to put a comma, I’m not your guy. Right now, I’m working with a military physical therapist, Jeff Frankart, who took a new approach to treating pain, mostly back pain, and created the most amazing program for relieving neuromuscular injuries. He had to deal with soldiers with the most horrific injuries who simply didn’t want to be discharged. Instead of the usual “take it easy, be careful, rest up, take these meds’ approach, Major Frankart did completely the opposite. He pushed them as hard as he could and amazingly, many of them recovered from what appeared to be crippling injuries. He had guys with damaged spines not just back running but jumping out of airplanes into combat! The book will be out later in 2020. It’s a tremendous message of the importance of resilience and independence in not only dealing with back pain but also life. I’m also ghostwriting a book on neurofeedback and another one on How to Marry Your Second Wife/Husband First. I am also helping a Hollywood actress write a book about charisma and another woman trace her evolution from a dominated and abused child to a self-loving and confident woman.

New Delhi The National Green Tribunal (NGT)-appointed Yamuna Monitoring Committee (YMC) wrote to the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) on August 4, accusing it of "concealing facts" on the continued dumping of debris and waste in the Yamuna floodplains and asking it to submit a "comprehensive report". The two-member YMC has given the DDA more time to submit a report."From media reports and videos on social media...it is evident that the reports given to YMC were not reliable. The claims had clearly been made without checking the ground situation and amounted to concealment of facts," YMC's letter stated. The YMC had ordered an inspection of the floodplains underneath the Signature Bridge and the Sarai Kale Khan flyover by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) and DDA after complaints of dumping of debris and biomedical waste surfaced on July 27. "DDA is requested to institute an efficient and reliable system to prevent ingress in the floodplains. The delay in responses is also highlighted and is resulting in public apprehension that nothing is being done. You may wish to fix accountability as the officers who have been reporting to YMC appear not to be conversant with the ground reality and depend on others without checking," it said. The committee also said that despite it asking DDA several times to augment the number of security personnel given the size of the floodplains, repeated cases of fresh encroachment and riverside dumping, it has not been done. "Also, it is shocking that debris is still lying on the site, despite DDA claiming that the 4,600 cubic metres of construction and demolition debris has been collected and the floodplains are free of such dumped material", it said. YMC also asked DPCC that the joint inspection report be submitted and "punitive" action be taken against the violators polluting the floodplains. In response to the letter, DDA initiated another inspection of the floodplains on August 4. DDA vice-chairman Anurag Jain said, "An inspection was taken up by the DDA on July 29 and again on August 4. It was found that the debris had been lying after construction work undertaken by different agencies. The DDA took up the matter with the respective agencies and they have agreed on clearing it expeditiously. Also, a systemic change is being put in place so that it is not repeated in the future. Besides, adequate security personnel had already been deployed."Hindustan Times (on July 28 and August 1) reported on the unabated dumping of construction debris as well as it being levelled and flattened at various locations, including Mayur Vihar, Sarai Kale Khan and at the Signature Bridge.

New Delhi A day after a man was robbed and killed, and his friend grievously injured, by three unidentified men in west Delhi's Tilak Nagar, police on Thursday said they have arrested all three and detained a juvenile accomplice. Police said the attack was planned as a revenge by one of the arrested suspects, who was an employee of the man who survived the attack and was sacked recently. The man who planned the attack was identified as Sonu Singh, 19, and he used to work at the packaged food distribution agency run by the injured man, Dheeraj, until a few months ago. His associates were identified as Kawaljeet Kumar, 19, previously involved in six criminal cases, and Anil Bahadur, 19 -- all residents of Tilak Nagar. While one juvenile accomplice was also apprehended, police said they're on the lookout for another suspect, Kuldeep Prakash, who is on the run and was previously involved in a murder and robbery case in Vikas Puri.According to the police, a call was received at the Tilak Nagar police station at 11.29pm reporting that a few men had stabbed two men at Block 24 in Tilak Nagar and had fled towards Mall Road. "A police team reached the spot found that the injured persons had already been taken to Deen Dayal Upadhyay hospital. While one of the injured men, Ranjan Mishra, 25, who had sustained stab wounds to his right thigh, was pronounced dead at the hospital, his friend Dheeraj, who was also critically injured, survived and is undergoing treatment. His condition continues to be critical due to excessive bleeding," said a police officer, who did not want to be named. Additional deputy commissioner of police (west) Sameer Sharma said one of the eyewitnesses, who helped shift the injured to DDU hospital, told the police that he had seen three men attacking the duo and then fleeing on a motorcycle. "The eyewitness said the injured also told him that they have been robbed of their laptop, mobile phone and ₹45,000 cash. A case of robbery and murder was registered and the investigation was taken up," Sharma said.He said, after hours of scanning CCTV footage, technical surveillance, local enquiries and verification of least 50 active criminals, the suspects were identified as residents of Tilak Nagar. "Our teams raided their hideouts and arrested them. Of the money they had stolen, ₹24,640 was recovered along with a knife used in the murder," the additional DCP said. Sharma said, during interrogation, Sonu revealed that he used to be an employee of Dheeraj at the latter's shop. "He said they had gotten into a dispute over salary and Dheeraj had sacked him. When Sonu told his juvenile friend about Dheeraj, he introduced him to Kawaljeet, Anil and Kuldeep. As Sonu had also told them that Dheeraj leaves for his house every night with a daily collection of about ₹50,000, they hatched a plan to rob Dheeraj," he said.The officer said, as planned, the juvenile suspect followed Dheeraj and Ranjan as soon as they left the shop around 10.30pm Tuesday. When they reached Choukhandi Chowk, the juvenile informed Sonu, Kanwaljeet and Anil, who intercepted the duo near Block 24 to rob them. But when the two men fought back, the trio stabbed both of them and fled with their valuables," Sharma said. He said Kuldeep had helped the trio in carrying out the crime and several police teams are currently searching for him..

PORTSMOUTH -- After an hour of comments from the public, and the fire and police chiefs, the Parking and Traffic Safety Committee on Thursday voted to defer further debate about the safety of the Middle Street bike lanes until its September meeting.
   
 The topic was on the agenda for the PTSC to discuss Thursday morning but the committee agreed with resident Charles Griffin that reports from city staff should be published before there's debate and/or decisions made. No information was included with a "packet" for Thursday's meeting.
   
 The safety discussion follows a July 26 accident when a cyclist was "doored" by an opening car door and suffered what Fire Chief Todd Germain described as facial injures.
   
 Germain on Thursday read a report from a fire captain who responded to the July 26 accident and wrote the cyclist was "entering the protected bike lane on Middle Street when someone in a vehicle that was parked opened the passenger side door, resulting in the cyclist striking the door and falling to the ground." The cyclist refused an ambulance ride and police were called to the scene, as is Fire Department protocol in cases involving injuries, Germain said.
   
 Police Capt. Mark Newport said the accident is considered non-reportable from a police standpoint because the vehicle was not moving.
   
 "It just happened that at the same time the bicyclist came through the lane, the person on the passenger side opened the door simultaneously and they hit it," Newport said. "From our standpoint, we wouldn't have an official accident report."
   
 The configuration of the bike lanes have vehicles parked off the curb with the bike lane between the vehicles and curb.
   
 Resident Gerald Duffy attended the virtual meeting and said he's noticed the road striping has faded, adding it's important to the safety of the bike lanes' design and calling on the city to find funds to re-stripe the area.
   
 Resident and former city councilor Ned Reynolds attended the Zoom-platform meeting from the area of Middle Street where the accident occurred. He reported there were three recycling bins and five bags of trash in the bike lane, as well as two cars parked in the buffer area. Reynolds said he thinks education about the proper way to park, combined with enforcement will improve safety.
   
 Resident Marie Nelson said children are riding cycles on Lincoln Avenue, instead of using the bike lane, to get to school. "It's just not being used," she said.
   
 Resident "CJ" Fleck said he's in favor of the bike lanes but there's room for improvement. He said the road's condition "is kind of junky" and the entry into the bike lane, where the accident happened is "tricky."
   
 Committee member Mary Lou McElwain said she's witnessed "close calls" with doors opening on the drivers' sides of vehicles and said there's a need to look at the big picture. She made a motion to revisit the topic during the September meeting with a report from city staff.
   
 Planning Director Juliet Walker said she will provide a thorough report "for a more robust discussion."
   
 Committee member Stephen Pesci said cyclists being doored is one of the most common bicycling accidents, and in other countries people are taught to open doors with the "Dutch reach," when they open a door with the opposite hand, so their bodies are turned to get a better look at surroundings.
   
 "We might want to be encouraging that as well," he said.
   
 City Councilor Peter Whelan, chair of the PTSC, said the committee needs to be transparent, have all the facts and "let the people weigh in" when it next meets. McElwain's motion to revisit the topic next month was passed by a unanimous vote.

"We've spent the last months looking at best practices across the country, talking to policing experts, police chiefs, former police chiefs and how their jurisdictions are addressing these issues and have addressed them in past years, so I want to propose that we bring those to the task force, generally, and that we bring them to the subcommittees as appropriate...as soon as possible."
 During public comment, Ken Abraham, former deputy attorney general, who became a prison advocate after serving time behind bars, recommended the task force create a subcommittee to investigate alleged wrongdoing by Delaware Department of Correction staff.
 Peter Murray recommended police forces have full-time mental health first response units, funded by the state.
 "Instead of putting that burden on the police," Murray said.
 When it comes to that healthy dose of skepticism Parson mentioned, activist Coby Owens, who led the largest Black Lives Matter protest in Delaware, brought his. He said he's disappointed that the task force lacks young persons who've been on the ground, leading the recent movement.
 "I think one of the things that was said by the co-chair, Rep. Cooke 'we want everyone's input; we want everyone's involvement in this.' I think we should give them the power to be on this task force...and have a say," he said.
 He also called for a true end to chokeholds--unlike legislation passed by the state, New Castle County, and Dover police--which includes exceptions when law enforcement life is in danger.
 "It should have been banned flat-out," he said. "I hope that this task force is not just for show. I hope that you actually listen to the community activists."

Breaking things down by model, the 2021 Legacy still comes in Base, Premium, Sport and Limited trims. Each packs a 2.5-liter flat-four engine with 182 horsepower and 176 pound-feet of torque. A CVT sends power to all four wheels via the automaker's standard all-wheel drive system. It's kind of what makes a Subaru a Subaru, after all. The Limited XT and Touring XT trims also return and add a 2.4-liter turbo-four engine with 260 hp and 277 lb-ft of torque.
 Across the board, price increases are minimal; at most, the Legacy costs $250 more in Limited XT and Touring XT guises. The latter is the most expensive Legacy you can buy, topping $37,195. Otherwise, the sedan stays rather steady.
 The far more popular Outback model also returns with the same trims, powertrains and amenities, and mirrors the Legacy save for the Onyx Edition XT. The special model gets more rugged equipment like an upgraded X-Drive mode, black exterior elements and a special upholstery that's mighty easy to clean. Like the Legacy, price increases don't surpass $250 for any trim. If you're looking at the volume model, the Outback Premium, it's now $30,095 after a $150 price increase.
 The cars will arrive at dealers this October.

The COVID-19 pandemic and the Company's associated responses negatively impacted Adjusted EBITDA by $14.9 million during the three months ended June 30, 2020, primarily driven by a decrease in revenues from the suspension of data overage fees, late charges and reconnect fees, reduced advertising revenues and diminished growth in business services revenues, coupled with higher labor costs and bad debt expense. These negative Adjusted EBITDA impacts were mostly offset by a greater-than-usual quarterly gain in residential data customers and the associated increase in residential data revenues as well as a largely unexpected reduction of certain expenses that resulted from shelter-in-place orders and the Company's expanded work-from- home program during the three months ended June 30, 2020.

WASHINGTON (AP) — A Democratic senator said Thursday he is launching an investigation into changes at the U.S. Postal Service that are causing delays in mail deliveries across the country just as big volume increases are expected for mail-in election voting.A plan imposed by Louis DeJoy, a Republican fundraiser who took over the top job at the Postal Service in June, eliminates overtime for hundreds of thousands of postal workers and orders that mail be kept until the next day if distribution centers are running late.Michigan Sen. Gary Peters, the top Democrat on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, said DeJoy, an ally and donor of President Donald Trump, has failed to provide answers about service delays "that are preventing Americans from receiving critical mail on time, including prescription drugs, business mail and mail-in ballots.''Peters is asking the public to provide their stories about delays or other problems with deliveries.The Senate inquiry comes as lawmakers increasingly focus on the Postal Service, which is reeling from mail delays and financial problems at a time when record numbers of mail ballots are expected in the November presidential election because of the coronavirus pandemic.Trump, a vocal critic of the Postal Service, contended Wednesday that "the Post Office doesn't have enough time" to handle a significant increase in mail-in ballots. He said, "I mean you're talking about millions of votes. ... It's a catastrophe waiting to happen."DeJoy met with Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi Wednesday in what Schumer called "a heated discussion."Democrats told DeJoy that "elections are sacred" and urged him not to impose cutbacks "at a time when all ballots count," Schumer said. "You can't say, 'Oh, we'll get 94%.' It's insufficient. We are demanding that the regulations they put in place, which cut employment and cut overtime, be rescinded, particularly because of COVID and because of the elections."The House Oversight Committee has called DeJoy to testify at a hearing next month.Sen. Peters said in a statement, "For 245 years, the Postal Service has worked to provide reliable, consistent and on-time delivery that keeps Americans connected no matter where they live – especially in rural areas.""Unfortunately, in recent weeks, I've heard firsthand from constituents, postal workers and local officials in Michigan who have encountered problems with the timely and dependable service they count on to conduct business, get prescription medications and critical supplies and even exercise their right to vote.''Democrats are calling for the Postal Service to rescind the restrictions on overtime and other operational changes, and they have pushed for $10 billion for the Postal Service in talks with Republicans on a huge COVID-19 response bill. The figure is down from a $25 billion plan in a House-passed coronavirus measure. Key Republicans whose rural constituents are especially reliant on the post office support the idea.David Partenheimer, a spokesman for the Postal Service, declined to comment on DeJoy's meeting with Democrats. But he said the agency is using all available resources to "match the workload created by the impacts of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic." The Postal Service has "a liberal leave policy" and is aggressively trying to hire qualified candidates to replace tens of thousands of workers who have gotten sick or opted not to work because of the pandemic, he said. "We appreciate the patience of our customers and the efforts of employees as conditions change on a day-to-day basis," he said. Partenheimer disputed reports that the Postal Service is slowing down election mail or any other mail. “We continue to employ a robust and proven process to ensure proper handling of all election mail consistent with our standards,’' he said.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

Gareth Bale “preferred not to play” for Real Madrid in their Champions League return tie at Manchester City, Zinedine Zidane has explained.
 Madrid take on City in the second leg of their Round of 16 tie on Friday and are trailing 2-1 from the first leg, with the Welshman left out of the 24-man squad entirely.
 The Welshman has been a peripheral figure at Los Blancos this season and had been an unused substitute for five successive games before being left out of the matchday squad entirely in the final game against Leganes earlier this month.
 Indeed, Bale has been in the headlines for his actions as a substitute recently – appearing to be sleeping during the win over Alaves while mimicking to be using binoculars from the stands in the recent triumph over Granada.
 “In the end many things are said and we have a respectful relationship between the coach and the player,” Zidane told his pre-match press conference, via Marca.
 “It is a private conversation, but I can only tell you that he preferred not to play and the rest is between him and me.”
 Zidane was then asked if not including Bale was a personal decision, to which he responded: “Yes, but I’m not going to tell you anything else because it’s something between him and me.”
 Has Bale disappointed Zidane? “He has not disappointed me and I will not tell you anything. It is the third question about Gareth. I respect him and everyone and these things have to stay in the locker room.”
 Does Bale have a future at Madrid with Zidane as coach? “I don’t know, he’s now a Madrid player, nothing changes and I respect that. He preferred not to play and that’s the only thing I can tell you. We are concentrating on tomorrow’s game.”
 Bale has played just 1,261 minutes this campaign – the lowest of his stint in the Spanish capital – and has missed 13 games through injury while he was overlooked by boss Zinedine Zidane on a further 16 occasions.
 James Rodriguez and Mariano Diaz – two other out-of-favour attacking players who look set to leave Madrid this summer – have also both failed to make the cut for the squad.

But we talked about how there's a lot of pressure right now to speak. To kind of gild the lily when you're doing press for a movie that is an unconventional role, or a romance with a slightly political bent. Sometimes I get frustrated and I really push away from me needing to declare why this is a strong female character or why this is feminist or why this is important, because I think the roles that someone chooses are all the evidence you need of their politics. Storytelling, in that sense, does affect culture in whatever small way, but you're doing it via subterfuge, rather than explicitly.

A day after a man was robbed and killed, and his friend grievously injured, by three unidentified men in west Delhi's Tilak Nagar, police on Thursday said they have arrested all three and detained a juvenile accomplice.
 Police said the attack was planned as a revenge by one of the arrested suspects, who was an employee of the man who survived the attack and was sacked recently.
 The man who planned the attack was identified as Sonu Singh, 19, and he used to work at the packaged food distribution agency run by the injured man, Dheeraj, until a few months ago. His associates were identified as Kawaljeet Kumar, 19, previously involved in six criminal cases, and Anil Bahadur, 19 -- all residents of Tilak Nagar.
 While one juvenile accomplice was also apprehended, police said they're on the lookout for another suspect, Kuldeep Prakash, who is on the run and was previously involved in a murder and robbery case in Vikas Puri.
   
   
 According to the police, a call was received at the Tilak Nagar police station at 11.29pm reporting that a few men had stabbed two men at Block 24 in Tilak Nagar and had fled towards Mall Road. "A police team reached the spot found that the injured persons had already been taken to Deen Dayal Upadhyay hospital. While one of the injured men, Ranjan Mishra, 25, who had sustained stab wounds to his right thigh, was pronounced dead at the hospital, his friend Dheeraj, who was also critically injured, survived and is undergoing treatment. His condition continues to be critical due to excessive bleeding," said a police officer, who did not want to be named.
 Additional deputy commissioner of police (west) Sameer Sharma said one of the eyewitnesses, who helped shift the injured to DDU hospital, told the police that he had seen three men attacking the duo and then fleeing on a motorcycle.
 "The eyewitness said the injured also told him that they have been robbed of their laptop, mobile phone and ₹45,000 cash. A case of robbery and murder was registered and the investigation was taken up," Sharma said.
 He said, after hours of scanning CCTV footage, technical surveillance, local enquiries and verification of least 50 active criminals, the suspects were identified as residents of Tilak Nagar. "Our teams raided their hideouts and arrested them. Of the money they had stolen, ₹24,640 was recovered along with a knife used in the murder," the additional DCP said.
 Sharma said, during interrogation, Sonu revealed that he used to be an employee of Dheeraj at the latter's shop. "He said they had gotten into a dispute over salary and Dheeraj had sacked him. When Sonu told his juvenile friend about Dheeraj, he introduced him to Kawaljeet, Anil and Kuldeep. As Sonu had also told them that Dheeraj leaves for his house every night with a daily collection of about ₹50,000, they hatched a plan to rob Dheeraj," he said.
 The officer said, as planned, the juvenile suspect followed Dheeraj and Ranjan as soon as they left the shop around 10.30pm Tuesday. When they reached Choukhandi Chowk, the juvenile informed Sonu, Kanwaljeet and Anil, who intercepted the duo near Block 24 to rob them. But when the two men fought back, the trio stabbed both of them and fled with their valuables," Sharma said. He said Kuldeep had helped the trio in carrying out the crime and several police teams are currently searching for him..

The National Green Tribunal (NGT)-appointed Yamuna Monitoring Committee (YMC) wrote to the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) on August 4, accusing it of "concealing facts" on the continued dumping of debris and waste in the Yamuna floodplains and asking it to submit a "comprehensive report".
 The two-member YMC has given the DDA more time to submit a report.
 "From media reports and videos on social media...it is evident that the reports given to YMC were not reliable. The claims had clearly been made without checking the ground situation and amounted to concealment of facts," YMC's letter stated.
 The YMC had ordered an inspection of the floodplains underneath the Signature Bridge and the Sarai Kale Khan flyover by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) and DDA after complaints of dumping of debris and biomedical waste surfaced on July 27.
   
   
 "DDA is requested to institute an efficient and reliable system to prevent ingress in the floodplains. The delay in responses is also highlighted and is resulting in public apprehension that nothing is being done. You may wish to fix accountability as the officers who have been reporting to YMC appear not to be conversant with the ground reality and depend on others without checking," it said.
 The committee also said that despite it asking DDA several times to augment the number of security personnel given the size of the floodplains, repeated cases of fresh encroachment and riverside dumping, it has not been done.
 "Also, it is shocking that debris is still lying on the site, despite DDA claiming that the 4,600 cubic metres of construction and demolition debris has been collected and the floodplains are free of such dumped material", it said.
 YMC also asked DPCC that the joint inspection report be submitted and "punitive" action be taken against the violators polluting the floodplains.
 In response to the letter, DDA initiated another inspection of the floodplains on August 4.
 DDA vice-chairman Anurag Jain said, "An inspection was taken up by the DDA on July 29 and again on August 4. It was found that the debris had been lying after construction work undertaken by different agencies. The DDA took up the matter with the respective agencies and they have agreed on clearing it expeditiously. Also, a systemic change is being put in place so that it is not repeated in the future. Besides, adequate security personnel had already been deployed."
 Hindustan Times (on July 28 and August 1) reported on the unabated dumping of construction debris as well as it being levelled and flattened at various locations, including Mayur Vihar, Sarai Kale Khan and at the Signature Bridge.

 The hosts were 92-4 at stumps on the second day, after slumping to 12-3, in reply to Pakistan's first innings 326 that featured opener Masood's Test-best 156.
 Ollie Pope defied Pakistan to be 46 not out, with Jos Buttler unbeaten on 15. But England were still 234 runs behind with no more specialist batsmen left.
 It took towering left-armer Shaheen Afridi just four balls to have Rory Burns lbw before Mohammad Abbas struck twice in quick succession.
 Dom Sibley was plumb lbw before the accurate Abbas bowled Stokes, standing well out of his ground, with a superb ball that clipped the top of off-stump.
 England were now 12-3, with the cheers of Pakistan's reserve players on the hotel balconies overlooking the ground trying to compensate for the absence of their passionate fans in what is a behind closed doors series because of the coronavirus.
 \- Root falls -
 Joe Root, the England captain, and Pope kept Pakistan at bay with a stand of exactly 50.
 But leg-spinner Yasir Shah then had Root, who made a struggling 14 off 58 balls, well caught by wicketkeeper Mohammad Rizwan after the skipper edged an intended cut.
 The day started brilliantly for England when, with Thursday's sixth ball, James Anderson had Babar Azam edging to first-slip Root for 69 without Pakistan having then added to their overnight 139.
 But Masood pressed on to join a select group of Pakistan batsmen who have scored hundreds in three successive Test innings.
 The 30-year-old left-hander batted for nearly eight hours in largely bowler- friendly conditions to surpass his previous Test-best of 135 against Sri Lanka in Karachi in December.
 He received excellent support from Shadab Khan (45) in a sixth-wicket stand of 105 as England were run ragged after Pakistan had been struggling at 176-5.
 Pakistan had managed just 48 runs for the loss of three wickets in Thursday's first session to reach 187-5 at lunch.
 But with five overs until the new ball, Root then bowled his own occasional off-breaks in tandem with frontline spinner Dom Bess immediately after the interval.
 Masood and Shadab responded by adding 27 runs with both batsmen well set by the time England took the new ball.
 There were no nervous 90s for Masood, who had been reprieved twice on 45 by Buttler on Wednesday after the wicketkeeper dropped a catch and missed a stumping off the unfortunate Bess.
 Two late-cut boundaries off Stuart Broad took him to 96 before Masood, who struggled during Pakistan's 2016 tour of England, completed a 251-ball century, including 13 fours.
 As well as being his fourth hundred in 21 Tests, and a first against England, it was also Masood's third in a row, after his century against Sri Lanka was followed by 100 against Bangladesh in Rawalpindi in February.
 Masood, educated in England, was the sixth Pakistan batsman to score a hundred in three consecutive Test innings after Zaheer Abbas, Mudassar Nazar, Mohammad Yousuf, Younis Khan -- now Pakistan's batting coach -- and Misbah-ul-Haq.
 All-rounder Shadab holed out off Bess with a mistimed slog to mid-on.
 Fast bowler Jofra Archer then took two tail-end wickets with successive deliveries before Afridi survived the hat-trick.
 Masood, playing a textbook opener's innings, upped the tempo by hoisting and driving Bess for two sixes.
 He eventually fell lbw after tea to Broad, having faced 319 balls, hitting 18 fours and two sixes.
 Broad led England's attack with 3-54 from 22.3 overs while Archer also took three wickets.

French President Emmanuel Macron Thursday called for an international investigation into the blast at Beirut's port that killed more than 130 people and ravaged entire neighbourhoods, costing the country billions.
 "An international, open and transparent probe is needed to prevent things from remaining hidden and doubt from creeping in," he told reporters at the end of a snap visit to the Lebanese capital.
 In asking for an international enquiry, he joined calls widely supported in and outside Lebanon for an independent probe, and said French investigators were on their way to Beirut.
 Even as they counted their dead and cleared streets of debris, many Lebanese were boiling with anger over a blast they see as the most shocking expression yet of their leadership's incompetence.
 Lebanese authorities said the massive explosion was triggered by a fire igniting 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate stored in a warehouse at Beirut's port.
 But many questions have been raised as to how such a huge cargo of highly explosive material could have been left unsecured for years.
 Macron said a French military aircraft carrier was hours away from landing in Beirut with "rescue teams and investigators to take the search and the probe forward".
 Lebanon's foreign minister had announced on French radio Thursday that an investigating committee had been given four days to determine responsibility for Tuesday's devastating explosion.
 Yet most of the members of this committee are high-ranking officials who command little trust from the people and many relatives of the blast's victims have been calling for foreign investigators.
 The cataclysmic explosion, which left an estimated 300,000 people temporarily homeless and injured around 5,000 people, struck when Lebanon was already battling rampant inflation and rising poverty.
 The International Monetary Fund has offered help but Lebanon's political leaders have balked at the measures the monetary institution is requesting for a rescue package to be approved.
 To help ease the crisis, an international aid conference for Lebanon would be held "in the coming days," Macron said.
 He stressed that the aid raised during the conference would be chanelled "directly to the people, the relief organisations and the teams that need it on the ground".
 The French president took a tough tone on the reforms he said were the only thing holding back a massive aid package that could put the ailing country back in the saddle.
 Speaking of Lebanon's political leaders, Macron said: "Their responsibility is huge, that of a revamped pact with the Lebanese people in the coming weeks, that of deep change."

There are some other intriguing points about this episode. Roswaal's conversation with Subaru makes me think that he somehow knows about Return By Death. Otherwise, his confidence that things will work out the way he envisions would be entirely unfounded, as Subaru himself points out. And if he does know about all those timelines where everyone dies, then his callousness knows no bounds. With friends like these, who needs enemies? We also get some hints that maybe Frederica is plotting something ominous herself, and things are definitely not looking good at the mansion when Subaru shows up back there and immediately has his intestines cut loose.

He also said he is in discussions about the language of a bill that is set to be introduced before Congress that seeks to address reporting mechanisms for sexual assault and harassment in the military.
 “One harassment and one assault is one too many,” McCarthy said.
 McCarthy said he conducted nine listening sessions and had candid conversations with Fort Hood soldiers of every echelon this week to understand the culture on and off the base. He said investigators will be conducting a full independent review to understand why Fort Hood has seen a rise in felonies and violent crimes.
 McCarthy said that in the last two weeks he heard concerns from soldiers about Guillen’s death while visiting bases in Poland and Italy.
 McCarthy also announced the Army would be rolling out an initiative called Project Inclusion to address “behaviors that tear at the fabric of our force.” He said these included diversity, discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual assault and suicide. He cited a nationwide reckoning that has occurred amid protests over racial injustice following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.

EXETER -- C3I Inc. is a small but mighty 20-employee defense contractor making the lighting systems for ships of all sizes in the U.S. Navy's fleet in a factory just passed the Rinks at Exeter.
   
 On Wednesday morning, U.S. Rep. Chris Pappas and state Sen. Jon Morgan toured the headquarters to learn how the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), part of the federal CARES Act, benefitted the company deemed essential during the coronavirus pandemic, because of its status as a defense contractor.
   
 C3I manufactures the entire lighting control systems for more than 70 Navy and Coast Guard vessels, including those with any kind of aircraft stationed aboard. The systems are designed to work for both daylight missions and those requiring the use of night vision.
   
 President Mike Curry, a 15-year veteran of the Navy, said its contracts are for both Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) and Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR). He said the pandemic has mostly caused some delay in contracts being awarded for both NAVSEA and NAVAIR, creating some cashflow issues for C3I. He added his vendors, for the most part all New England-based, have also run into delays delivering certain components for technology to C3I to complete projects.
   
 "I'm just amazed that we have created this niche market where we're providing hardware and software control devices on the flight deck of U.S. Navy ships," Curry said. "On a flight deck, you have all of the green lights will also be white lights … during the night vision operations. … It's all night vision- compatible lighting. It's a lot more complicated than a simple on/off switch."
   
 The PPP's intent was to put money into the hands of businesses to keep their workers employed while commerce was shutdown to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. In total, 4.9 million loans were issued to American businesses and nonprofits through the PPP. Loans in the amount of $150,000, or more only accounted for 15% of all PPP relief. The average loan was roughly $100,000.
   
 According to data released from the Small Business Administration, C3I received a PPP loan ranging between $350,000 and $1 million and reported saving 15 positions. Curry said between PPP and the Emergency Family and Medical Leave Expansion Act (EFMLEA), he was able to keep his entire staff employed without putting anyone on furlough.
   
 The EFMLEA pays two-thirds of an employee's salary while they are out of work, leaving the employer to pick up the rest. Curry said when his employees have had to travel for work, it entails two weeks of quarantine on either end of the trip, and EFMLEA afforded C3I the ability to pay people who were out while quarantining.
   
 Curry said none of his employees or their families contracted COVID-19.
   
 "We're in a business where it's difficult to furlough," Curry said. "I can't just hire a guy off the street even it he's a degreed engineer and expect him to be productive on Day 1. I need a break-in period and that break-in period in this business is two years; I need to have my team, even if I have to pay them with no work to do until I get that contract in the door."
   
 Darren Winham, director of economic development, said he appreciated Pappas and Morgan taking the time to listen to C3I's needs as it works to stay on course through the pandemic.
   
 "Today's candid discussion regarding federal stimulus resources and how a local business employed the same was very fruitful," Winham said. "When Congressman Pappas and state Senator Morgan take the time to drill down on how this affects a New Hampshire small-ish business really helps them focus on how to best direct their efforts."
   
 But with no end in sight for the pandemic and more than a thousand Americans dying each day, the national conversation has shifted towards another round of federal stimulus.
   
 Though according to a Seacoastonline review of PPP loans to Seacoast businesses, more than 100 reported either not retaining a single employee or left the section of the application blank.
   
 Pappas said he supports targeted relief for smaller businesses in another round of stimulus, should Congress pass another piece of legislation.
   
 "The big players, the ones with lots of accountants and lawyers were the first ones in line for PPP, unfortunately," Pappas said. "It took some of our smaller businesses longer to get the help that they need. … We've got to open up a second round (of stimulus) targeted to the smallest businesses, and make sure there's some oversight and accountability to ensure that folks are playing by the rules and that there's some transparency for taxpayers."
   
 Curry said, should another round of stimulus pass, he hopes Congress includes a provision bumping up the cap to pay employees beyond $100,000, upwards of an additional $25,000 to $30,000 per employee. He said he also recommends businesses having more flexibility to use stimulus funds beyond just payroll, such as patching temporary cashflow constraints.
   
 "I have very many senior employees who are all north of $100k. … When you're in a technical position in New Hampshire … someone with 10 years experience is somewhere near $100,000 already," Curry said. "In a small business, anytime you have a big order you have to lay out a lot of cash for vendors to buy materials in order to build the material. I have had to juggle and slow down some paths to some of my vendors because I didn't have the cash to support it."

Valentino Rossi said Thursday he was proud to be looking at the prospect of reaching his 200th MotoGP top-class podium at Brno this weekend -- but declined to stress out about it.
 "When you are older, you start to see the numbers and it's good, I'm proud," the Italian Yamaha rider said ahead of the Czech GP where he had won his maiden race in 1996.
 "But for sure it's not the major motivation for me. It's just a number in the end," he told a video conference.
 "I'm not here for the 200th podium, I'm here because I like motorcycle racing and I like the challenge, to try to stay at the top," added the 41-year-old veteran.
 The seven-time MotoGP world champion earned his 199th podium in the top class after finishing third at Jerez two weeks ago, his first podium finish since the United States last year.
 "I enjoyed the weekend, being back on the podium after a longer time and a difficult period was a great feeling," Rossi said.
 "So it's very important if I can also be strong here (in Brno). The track is great, I have always liked it but in the last years with Yamaha we have suffered a bit," he added.
 The Brno race will be held behind closed doors within measures taken to stem the coronavirus spread which has wreaked havoc on the MotoGP calendar for this season, with only 13 confirmed events and all those outside Europe cancelled.

Dendritic cells are part of what's called the innate immune response. These cells will respond to anything foreign that enters the body, the coronavirus included.
 "If they see something — they see a virus or bacteria — they become highly activated, and then they create a whole cascade of events," Glenn says.
 That cascade leads to the production of antibodies, and it's the antibodies that will recognize the specific virus of interest.
 Novavax's testing shows an adjuvant is critical to its vaccine working well. That's the case for many vaccines.
 But the strange thing is that there aren't a lot of adjuvants out there.
 "We only think about adjuvants when there's a dire need, such as this pandemic, for example," says Bali Pulendran, a vaccine developer at Stanford University. "Now everyone is interested in faster response and a better response and a longer-lasting response."
 Pulendran says for almost a century, scientists relied on a compound called alum to act as an adjuvant. It was only in the 1990s that new adjuvants started appearing on the scene. Now there are several more options, but Pulendran says more choices are needed.
 "This is a topic that needs, deserves better attention," he says.
 That's a sentiment Corey Casper totally agrees with. He's the CEO of the Infectious Disease Research Institute and a proselytizer for adjuvant research. Casper says to consider what happened when the pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline added a powerful adjuvant to a shingles vaccine.
 "It took a vaccine that had previously existed which was about 50% effective, and it made it 97% effective," Casper says. "Not just in all people but in the hardest-to-protect people, which are the elderly, who typically make poor immune responses."
 Casper says the vaccine community has underestimated the importance of adjuvants. He even has data suggesting that adjuvants alone might be capable of preventing infectious disease. That has enormous implications.
 "Every time a new infection pops up, there's a race to develop a new vaccine for it," Casper says. "But what if you could give the adjuvant alone and you didn't have to develop a vaccine? That adjuvant could be stockpiled, it could be made at millions of doses, placed on the shelf, sitting there waiting for the next pandemic."
 Sallie Permar, a vaccine researcher at Duke University, says there may be some validity to what Casper is proposing. She says scientists now have a better idea of how adjuvants work and how they might be able to prevent disease all by themselves.
 But Permar says you have to be careful with adjuvants.
 "There are some downsides to having such a strong adjuvant affect," she says
 In the process of activating immune cells, adjuvants can also bring on some of the symptoms of disease, such as fever, malaise or inflammation. The GlaxoSmithKline shingles vaccine works well because of its adjuvant, but many people complain about unpleasant side effects.
 One problem facing vaccine developers is the fact that many companies are reluctant to share their adjuvant technology.
 "Adjuvants end up being very proprietary," says Barney Graham, deputy director at the Vaccine Research Center at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. "It's kind of the secret sauce of how to make your protein vaccine work."
 Academic researchers are hoping the urgency of finding a successful vaccine against COVID-19 might make companies more willing to share.
 "There is a whole science awaiting us in vaccines that lies in adjuvants," Permar says.
 With so much attention being paid to vaccines now, that science may not be far off.
