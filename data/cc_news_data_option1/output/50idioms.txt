Prominent donors in Los Angeles argue that Buttigieg is also approaching celebrity fundraising differently than Hillary Clinton did four years ago.
 While her campaign publicized the appearances of Katy Perry and Lena Dunham at events, he’s kept a lid on similar associations.
 The fundraiser that Gwyneth Paltrow held on his behalf last May? The campaign declined to publicize it. Instead, Buttigieg spoke in front of cameras that evening during a $25 (and up) appearance at the Abbey — sort of a gay, West Hollywood equivalent of dining at Sylvia’s in Harlem with the Rev. Al Sharpton.
 “He wasn’t doing a song and dance with Gwyneth on national television,” said Simon Halls, a prominent entertainment industry publicist who in July was scheduled to co-host a reception at television producer Ryan Murphy’s home. (That event was canceled after a white police officer fatally shot a black man in South Bend; the reception has not been rescheduled.)
 An offer by designer Tom Ford to dress Buttigieg during the course of the campaign? Declined.
 In July, Buttigieg appeared at the Provincetown fundraiser Meck hosted with Bryan Rafanelli, an event planner whose clients have included Bill and Hillary Clinton. Although tickets cost a minimum of $1,000, Meck said the event took place after a free, packed and publicized town hall event. As Meck told it, Buttigieg told him that he wanted to spend his time in Provincetown actually meeting people. Later in the summer, he hit the Hamptons to collect more money.
 Yet Buttigieg’s rivals don’t seem to be cutting him much slack for the kitchen-sink approach.
 At the December debate, during a lengthy and heated exchange about money in politics, Sanders joked that Buttigieg and Biden appeared to be in a race for who could collect the most donations from billionaires. Biden was winning, 44-39, Sanders said.
 “We don’t keep track of that sort of thing,” said Chris Meagher, the national press secretary for the Buttigieg campaign, when asked whether this was true.

Sitting at a table near the stage was theater producer Jordan Roth, who back in April held an event for Buttigieg’s presidential campaign at his home in the West Village, at up to $2,800 per head. Nearby was the board chairman of God’s Love, Terrence Meck, who had co-hosted an event for Buttigieg in Provincetown, Massachusetts, just after the July 4 holiday. (Tickets for that ran upward of $1,000 per person.)
 Neither of those events drew particular attention, partly because the campaign did not publicize them and partly because Buttigieg polled in the low single digits for most of the spring and summer, when he was less of a threat to rivals like Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.
 Even at the God’s Love benefit in the fall, the biggest news to come out of it was the enormous applause Buttigieg received from Blaine Trump, the ex-wife of President Donald Trump’s brother Robert, who, in 2016, declined to endorse her former brother-in-law. (Although she didn’t walk around wearing an “I’m With Her” sticker either.)
 But Buttigieg is now in a leading position in the Democratic primary, at or near the top of the polls in Iowa and New Hampshire and in fourth place nationwide. He is running to the right of Sanders’ populist rhetoric and Warren’s “billionaire tears mugs,” and offering a generational contrast to former Vice President Joe Biden’s elder-statesman, Joe-from-Scranton appeal.
 Buttigieg has talked in campaign videos and in interviews about how Democrats cannot just “polish off” a broken political system and expect to win.
 So it is perhaps unsurprising that Buttigieg’s dinners and fundraisers — complete with cozy pictures on Instagram of Buttigieg standing beside high- net-worth bundlers — have turned into grist for his critics.
 Guests at a December fundraiser for Buttigieg held at the New York home of Kevin Ryan, an internet entrepreneur behind Gilt Groupe and Business Insider, were greeted outside by protesters who banged pots and pans and called Buttigieg “Wall Street Pete.”
 Police arrived when a protester got inside. By that point, Buttigieg had left for Wintour’s West Village town house, where a campaign dinner was being held. Tickets cost up to $2,800 each and actress Sienna Miller was among the attendees.
 Days later, Buttigieg appeared at a fundraiser held inside a Napa Valley wine cave in California. Afterward, progressive activists reached deep into political crisis history to note that one of the hosts, Craig Hall, who is now the owner of Hall Wines in Rutherford, California, was a real estate developer involved in the savings and loan crisis in the 1980s. Hall went to Jim Wright, then speaker of the House, for help when he was facing bankruptcy — and the cascade of events led to a bailout for Hall, a congressional ethics investigation and, ultimately, Wright’s resignation as speaker.
 Hall’s wife, Kathryn Walt Hall, co-hosted the Napa benefit. She was a prolific donor to President Bill Clinton and served as ambassador to Austria from 1997 to 2001.
 The dinner for Buttigieg took place beneath a “raindrop chandelier with 1,500 Swarovski crystals,” The New York Times reported. To be fair, those sparklies can be found on $50 leotards. They’re barely more elite than Trump ties.
 But that didn’t stop Buttigieg’s detractors from using them as a symbol of what’s wrong with him. To some, it seemed like a dishonest but effective way to make a substantive point.
 Events like these are “not a good look,” said Rebecca Katz, a Democratic strategist who last year ran Cynthia Nixon’s primary campaign for governor of New York and who has not yet endorsed a presidential candidate. In an interview, she said that Buttigieg wants “to be in rooms with fancy people.”
 Buttigieg’s supporters see it differently. They point out that Buttigieg has pledged to refuse money from federal lobbyists, corporate political action committees, foreign agents or executives from the fossil fuel industry (though he changed his position on lobbyist money with his campaign already underway). They also note that Ryan, who hosted the picketed New York event, previously held a fundraiser for one of Warren’s Senate campaigns. ( Warren, like Sanders, has sworn off high-dollar fundraisers for this race.)

A community fund to help reduce the stresses of the cash bail system on poor pretrial detainees saw highs and lows in 2019, but in the end managed to help many non-violent misdemeanor defendants avoid the potentially far more detrimental effects of an extended jail stay.
 Race Matters, Friends used its Community Bail Fund to post bond for 34 people at the Boone County Jail, all of whom were county residents with nonviolent charges, no outstanding warrants and total bails of $2,000 or less. Through donations from the community, the fund spent $29,800 on bail and saw returns on 14 cases for a refund of $8,845.
 Volunteer Peggy Placier said just getting the fund started, up and rolling and helping its first clients was a monumental success that took months.
 "We did it," Placier said with pride. "We developed a process that works. We use it to orient volunteers to fielding calls, bailing people out and accompanying them to court. We have had two volunteer orientations and will have another in the spring."
 Of the 34 people helped, 21 were people of color, which reflects the larger issue of disparities in arrests in Columbia and Boone County. All the fund's clients face financial barriers and could not raise the money for the 10 percent fee usually charged by a bond agent or could not afford a low bond. Few had any support system.
 "Some of our clients have needs far beyond the Bail Fund's capacity," Placier said. "They may be unsheltered, have health problems, need treatment for substance abuse or mental health, need jobs, etc. We wish there was one clearinghouse for referral to services in the county. We are grateful to groups who address those other needs but it is a patchwork that is difficult to navigate."
 The all-volunteer group faced numerous challenges throughout 2019. Volunteer Carol Brown said it was difficult even getting on the list of bonding agents at the jail and the group only did so after researching the bond rules and speaking with the courts.
 "This was such a simple thing, but it revealed how the sheriff, jail and courts had fallen into old patterns that we were disrupting," Brown said. "The high for me was circumventing that, once we figured we were arbitrarily being left off because of a process that they took for granted. Once I read through the 13th Circuit Court rules we were sure that was what was going on. Once that was pointed out to the court administrator, we were magically added to the list without explanation."
 Because it can take months or years for the bail to be refunded to the bail fund, Placier said the group is constantly in fund-raising mode.
 "If you look at the data, as well as our experiences with the courts, our ongoing challenge is the slow pace of the legal system," Placier said. "This means we have to constantly be in fund-raising mode. We bailed people out last spring who are still not finished with their cases. Most qualify for a public defender, and they go on a long waiting list until they can be assigned an attorney."
 Regardless, Placier said, for those who were able to keep their jobs, homes and lives intact, the fund has made a huge impact. That would not be possible if not for the many people and businesses in the community who stepped up to help, as well as the volunteers who on short notice throughout the year traveled to the jail to help someone post bail.
 Going into 2020 she says the fund will continue its effort and will also focus on public education about the detriments of the cash bail system.
 "In the long run, just bailing people out, as important as it is to someone in jail, is accommodating the system as it is," Placier said. "We also want to change it. Too many people are spending months in jail on relatively minor charges, but with bail too high for them to afford. What is the purpose of this?"
