 She added that he had turned to drink after the sudden death of his partner.
 Miss Whebell said: “At the time he said that a bottle of wine would not touch the sides. These offences happened at a time when he was extremely low and extremely lonely.”
 She accepted that he had told the interviewing probation officer that he had no sexual interest in children.
 Miss Whebell said that the number of images were low compared to most similar cases.
 She added that he was in work, though furloughed, and had settled accommodation.

Higgins, who began producing electronic music as a hobby in college, live- streamed a performance with coworker Dan Mantello, who plays the guitar and painted all of Solstice’s tables in his newfound free time, through Solstice’s Instagram account.
 Higgins also took this time of social isolation to develop Solstice’s distinct, quirky Instagram voice.
 He realized three years ago that he could use his music production software to illustrate cartoons and create videos; but it wasn’t until the start of social distancing that Higgins began letting his personality shine through Solstice’s Instagram content.
 At the minimum, Higgins recognized that the page needed to convey the new business hours and specialities. From there, he could take creative liberties.
 In videos like “Coffee Talk,” Higgins explains in his earnest, comically awkward delivery the differences between drinks like the mezzo and au lait, endearing himself to viewers. Other videos, like one that shows Higgins conversing on the cafe’s porch with an animated illustration of Chillawak, the bison pictured in Solstice’s logo, involved more advanced editing.
 “That one is my favorite, because I really like being a child of the ‘90s and those kinds of green screen effects where it's like Paula Abdul dancing with a fox animation,” Higgins said.
 Although social media alone won’t save either Cafe Solstice or Cafe Citra, it’s serving as an entertaining distraction and offering business owners hope during a time when the future of small businesses and our beloved third spaces is unclear.
 “We're glad to do our part to help curb the pandemic, whether it is by wearing masks or closing down in-person business,” Shin said. “The small things like interacting with us on social media can make such a huge difference.”

Washington hospitals are fighting against the increase in hospital capacity to maintain stable conditions. According to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation projections updated Dec. 10, ICU beds needed in Washington hospitals will exceed ICU beds available by Jan. 2, 2021.
 Dr. Steve Mitchell, medical director of the emergency department at Harborview Medical Center and UW associate professor of emergency medicine, believes hospital capacity plays a “massive role already” in Washington.
 “We’ve been moving patients all over the state to keep our hospitals functional, keep them level loaded,” Mitchell said.
 Amid the hard work, Mitchell noted a sign that should be reassuring to everyone.
 “There has been unbelievable and remarkable cooperation across all levels of state government, every hospital and health system,” Mitchell said.
 Despite usually being competitive in the market for health care, Mitchell said all hospitals have put this aside to ensure that “everyone is in this together.”
 Furthermore, Mitchell believes there is light at the end of the tunnel as the Harborview Medical Center is rounding the corner on a COVID-19 vaccine. Mitchell thinks that the staff will be vaccinated by the end of the year.
 “The hope for everybody is just months away,” Mitchell said. “If we can recommit ourselves, we can keep the healthcare system available to everybody who really needs it.”

Holiday time is fast approaching, but unfortunately Santa (and millions of families) will be forced to quarantine throughout December. Kris Kringle has offloaded many of his responsibilities onto the United States Postal Service (USPS), which will deliver a historically large load of packages this holiday season. But, because USPS package prices are hopelessly out of whack with reality, delivering this year’s presents will blow a hole in the agency’s already-abysmal finances. By realigning parcel prices to reflect delivery costs, USPS can deliver holiday cheer and "sleigh" financial expectations.
 Even in a “normal” year, the USPS delivers more than 20 million packages per day for the last eight weeks of the year and nearly 30 million packages per day the week before Christmas. And, according to USPS Strategic Communications Specialist Floyd Wagoner, “From this point forward, all the way until Christmas, and into the middle of January with return packages, this would be the busiest year ever.” Even though, “the volumes are just too great for us to understand exactly how many are going to be coming through,” the agency hopes that a record influx and delivery of packages will stem the deluge of red ink flooding the agency.
 The USPS reported a fiscal year (FY) 2020 net loss of $9.2 billion, up from $8.8 billion in 2019. In its latest financial statement, the agency notes that package volume increased 18.8 percent from last year while first-class mail and marketing mail respectively declined by 4.2 percent and 15.2 percent. Sure, operating revenues are up $2 billion due to the unprecedented surge in e-commerce spurred by pandemic-era digital shopping. But this revenue increase couldn’t keep up with a whopping $2.3 billion increase in operating expenses, mostly due to the “workforce additions necessary to address the surge in package volume as a result of the pandemic.”
 These disappointing figures do little to counter the long-held suspicion among financial analysts that package prices do not reflect delivery costs. When calculating costs for different product categories, the devil is in the details. Trucks, scanners and employee compensation each add costs to the delivery of packages and regular letters, and USPS’ financial team must attribute a certain percentage of these costs to each product category. How the agency goes about doing this is a mystery to the public, but there are clues that the USPS is missing the mark and underestimating package delivery costs.

The Brooklyn-based band have a hypnotic, soothing sound with blasts of driving white noise energy. ‘Blankenship' is probably my fave song of theirs and boasts the best drum fill I’ve ever heard!"

In the budget for fiscal 2017, Higashidori was projected to be short by around ¥100 million, causing the village to turn to the so-called nuclear village — pro-nuclear groups in government, industry and academia.
 Higashidori made a series of attempts to save their finances. The village sold part of a piece of land that would have been a central residential area to Tohoku Electric for the price of ¥100 million.
 "We barely escaped from going into deficit," said a village official in charge.
 Before the nuclear disaster, Higashidori had been compiling an annual budget of about ¥10 billion. But the figure shrunk to the region of ¥6 billion to ¥8 billion from fiscal 2012, as it no longer was able to issue bonds relying on future revenue from the Higashidori nuclear plant that would be used for repayment.
 Despite the budget cut, the fiscal hardships continued. In order to help finance the village, in fiscal 2018 and 2019, Tokyo Electric and Tohoku Electric each donated ¥400 million via the _furusato nо̄zei_ (hometown tax donation) system for businesses.
 From fiscal 2019 to 2021, Higashidori is expected to receive a total of ¥1 billion from the central government in subsidies allocated to regions with power plants.
 Since the subsidy is usually provided the following fiscal year after a nuclear power plant starts operation, Higashidori’s case is rare.
 Tokyo Electric started construction of Higashidori nuclear power plant in January 2011, aiming to start its operation in March 2017, only for work to be suspended two months later due to the Fukushima nuclear disaster.
 "The village’s fiscal plan was drafted on the premise that there would be a revenue of ¥5 billion in fixed asset tax from the Higashidori nuclear power plant in fiscal 2018," explained an official at the village’s planning division.
 A shift in the policy of it’s operator, Tokyo Electric, is also a factor delaying the process.
 In 2017, the power company decided to solicit collaborators for the development of the Higashidori nuclear plant, instead of its initial plan to construct it on its own.
 Tokyo Electric has explained that it is still in the process of seeking a joint project, with construction not likely to resume anytime soon.
 Local economies in Aomori Prefecture, where many nuclear plants are located, continue to face difficulties, as many depend on tax revenue from the nuclear power industry and its related businesses.
 Among them, Higashidori has been dealt the heaviest blow.
 According to Aomori Prefecture, Higashidori’s gross product plunged 60.2% in fiscal 2016 — the latest figure available — from fiscal 2010. In the same period, neighboring Mutsu’s figure dropped 2.5%, while the figure for Oma, further around the coast, dropped 7.7%, prefectural data showed. An interim storage facility for spent nuclear fuel is being built in the former, while a nuclear plant is under construction in the latter.
 Higashidori's dire economy directly impacts small business owners such as Dai Minamikawa, 28, who runs a family-owned inn for nuclear plant workers.
 "There were days when we didn’t have any guests at all, so I took another job and used my savings to make ends meet," said Minamikawa.
 He has witnessed many neighboring stores, including a convenience store, a gasoline station, a bento shop and a construction company, disappear one after the other in the past 10 years.
 But Minamikawa is holding on to his business in the hope that the village will flourish once again due to the nuclear power plant business.
 Resuming operations at Tohoku Electric’s Higashidori nuclear plant is also an uphill battle.
 Though the utility applied to the Nuclear Regulation Authority for screening under new safety standards in June 2014, the process has taken years, since it is difficult to assess the risk of a fault running under the plant's premises.
 The business environment surrounding Tohoku Electric has also changed. Since the liberalization of the retail power market in 2016, Tokyo Electric, which split the construction cost for the Higashidori nuclear plant with Tohoku Electric, has now become Tohoku Electric's competitor.
 With uncertain prospects facing the nuclear plants and accumulating deficits damaging the economy, Higashidori is going through a dark, cold winter.
 The village is like the local _kandachime_ horse breed, persevering through winds and snow under the winter sky, awaiting the advent of spring.

A beautiful guitar melody constitutes the album’s opening track, “Simulacrum,” kick starting a dramatic album that captures the band’s dynamic, sometimes prog-inclined complexity without betraying the band’s primitive and savage roots. “Lash of the Tytans,” the release’s first proper song, explodes with inspirational fury as if it were a heavy metal call to arms. The bold melodies and savage attack duel one another simultaneously at times, trading positions at others. Augmenting the guitar melodies are the undistorted fretless bass lines by The Great Righteous Destroyer, wonderfully juxtaposing the blistering drum work. There is so much to soak in with “Psychic Secretions” that a dozen listening sessions are required to even scratch the surface of the depth of the brilliant artistry at hand. Death and black metal fans unfamiliar with StarGazer would be wise to dive into the band’s work, and “Psychic Secretions” is a great starting point.

Thursday afternoon, the Pac-12 announced Washington’s game versus Oregon will be canceled. The press release also stated the game will be declared a no contest under conference policy.
 “I’m so disappointed for everyone involved here,” Washington Athletic Director Jennifer Cohen said. “Every year our student-athletes, coaches, staff and Husky Nation circle this game on our calendar and so look forward to this amazing rivalry."
 Washington was originally scheduled to travel to Eugene, Oregon, in what had shaped up to be the Pac-12 North title game. Instead, the Huskies (3-1) will automatically be granted the Pac-12 North championship because they finished with a higher winning percentage than the Ducks (3-2).
 “The student-athletes from both schools have worked so hard," Cohen said. "And I’m just really disheartened we are this point where we are unable to play due to our COVID-19 positives within the program, but we will always put the health and well-being of our students, coaches and staff as our greatest priority when making decisions.”
 Washington's week one matchup with California and week three meeting with Washington State were both canceled due to COVID-19 issues with the opposition.
 While Washington was able to score a matchup with Utah following the cancellation of the Apple Cup, the Huskies were unable to schedule an opponent for the week of the California game.
 Now dealing with issues in its own locker room, Washington is not only forced to cancel this weekend’s game, but questions loom over the status of next weekend’s Pac-12 Championship, too.

Research by the More in Common project indicates that approximately 75% of Americans fall into what the project describes as the exhausted majority. This majority is characterized as having a clear understanding that we have more in common than that which divides us: our belief in freedom, equality and the pursuit of the American dream. This majority also shares a deep sense of gratitude for being citizens of the United States and wants us to move past our differences. The project identifies seven distinct voting blocs ranging from progressive activists on the left to committed conservatives on the right. This diversity of perspective disappears when collapsed into a two- party, us versus them mindset.
 Nonpartisan elections are one way to counteract the tendency for those on the fringes to set the debate. Running an issue-based rather than a party-based election forces candidates to directly address the concerns of constituents. Voters, too, must work harder to learn what candidates have to say. One cannot simply grab the party label as the basis for deciding. Removing party designations defuses us versus them thinking and associated stereotypes.
