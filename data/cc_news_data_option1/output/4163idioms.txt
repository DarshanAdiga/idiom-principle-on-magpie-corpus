Bleached kraft pulp is a pulp produced from softwood and hardwood tree species by implementing the kraft pulping process, which is bleached later to produce BKP. Our kraft pulp market analysis considers sales from products including bleached softwood kraft pulp and bleached hardwood kraft pulp. Our analysis also considers the sales of kraft pulp in APAC, Europe, North America, South America, and MEA. In 2018, the bleached hardwood kraft pulp segment had a significant market share, and this trend is expected to continue over the forecast period. Factors such as high demand for carton boards and printing and writing papers across the globe will play a significant role in the bleached hardwood kraft pulp segment to maintain its market position. Also, our global kraft pulp market report looks at factors such as increased adoption of hygiene products, awareness of using eco-friendly products, and booming e-commerce and packaging industry. However, volatility in raw material prices, adverse effect of increased digitization, and depletion in forest land may hamper the growth of the kraft pulp industry over the forecast period.

CHAMPAIGN -- The University of Illinois football team appears poised to make a statement in the Big Ten Conference. And coach Lovie Smith sees no reason why his team can't.
   
 Coming off their first bowl game in five years, the Illini boast an experienced lineup and a big addition on offense.
   
 "We made progress last year and we are building on that this year," Smith said. "This is the best football team we've had since I've been here. I really like where we are right now."
   
 Smith comes into his fifth season at Illinois with a 15-34 record and 8-28 in the conference. But the Illini were more competitive last season, finishing 6-7 overall (4-5 Big Ten) after losing to California in the Redbox Bowl.
   
 One reason is quarterback Brandon Peters, who started after transferring from Michigan. He is Illinois' first returning No. 1 QB since 2016.
   
 Peters, who missed two games last season with concussions, completed 55.3% of his passes for 1,884 yards. He threw for 18 touchdowns and was intercepted eight times.
   
 "It's been pretty comfortable this year, having that experience last year," Peters said. "There's always moving parts, but overall things are the same for the most part. All of us being on the same page is a huge plus."
   
 He has an experienced group of receivers, with Josh Imatorbhebhe, Danny Navarro and Daniel Barker combining for 78 receptions in 2019. Newly activated tight end Luke Ford, a Georgia transfer, is expected to play a major role in the passing game as well.
   
 The Illini are scheduled to open the season with a Friday night game at Wisconsin on Oct. 23. Last year, James McCourt kicked a 39-yard field as time expired and the Illini pulled a huge upset and knocked off No. 6 Wisconsin 24-23. Illinois' Tony Adams picked off a pass at midfield with 2 minutes 33 seconds remaining, who were 30 Â½-point underdogs, to set up the winning drive.
   
 The run game
   
 Illinois is counting on junior Mike Epstein to stay healthy and help carry the load at running back. He had season-ending injuries each of his three years, including one to the knee in the 2019 opener against Akron.
   
 Last year's leading rushers -- Reggie Corbin and Dre Brown -- are gone. And Re'Von Bonner has chosen to sit out the current season because of concerns over COVID-19. Backing up Epstein will be Western Michigan transfer Chase Brown.
   
 Getting defensive
   
 Linebacker Jake Hansen is back to lead the defense. He was tops in the nation with seven forced fumbles despite missing four games due to injury as a junior last season. Linebacker Milo Eifler added 10 tackles for loss in his first season at Illinois after transferring from Washington.
   
 The Illini also have three starters back in their secondary, including cornerbacks Nate Hobbs and Marquez Beason -- who missed last season with a torn ACL.
   
 Built Ford tough
   
 Tight end Luke Ford is drawing quite a bit of attention in Champaign this year. And it's not just because of his 6-foot-6 frame.
   
 A top recruit out of Carterville High School in southern Illinois, he's back playing in his home state after transferring from Georgia. Ford appeared in just nine games and caught one pass for the Bulldogs as a freshman in 2018. But the Illini hope he can deliver in a big way for them.
   
 "I have high expectations because I know what I'm capable of and I know what I can do," Ford said. "And I know that even though I sat out a year, I'll still be able to come in and hopefully be able to make an impact."
   
 Virus update
   
 Illinois has not released any information about the number of COVID-19 cases within the football program.
   
 "We have a protocol we feel real good about," Smith said. "We don't have any issues. All our guys were practicing for the most part. Our guys have been in compliance with what we have asked them to do."
   
 Scramble schedule
   
 Besides the opener at Wisconsin, the Illini also have tough home games against Minnesota (Nov. 7) and Ohio State (Nov. 28). Illinois was originally scheduled to open with a nonconference home game against Illinois State on Sept. 4. Then, the Illini were supposed to start with a Thursday night home game against Ohio State on Sept. 3. That changed again when the season was postponed in August.

KNOXVILLE -- After a two-week COVID-19-induced break, Knoxville High School's volleyball team was back on the hardwood Tuesday night.
   
 The Blue Bullets hadn't been together as a unit for contact day workouts since Tuesday, Sept. 22.
   
 "We'd been going, but then we were on hold due to a positive test," Knoxville volleyball coach Marci Tyrrell said while checking temps and asking the members of her program if they had any coronavirus symptoms. "We had a girl on the team that tested positive, so we stopped for two weeks, and then we had nobody else on the team test positive.
   
 "Obviously the masks are working, so we're happy about that."
   
 With a handful of sessions still on tap this month, what's Tyrrell's goal for her student-athletes?
   
 "Just for the girls to get in the weight room some more and get their hands on a volleyball," she said. "Most of them played club all winter, if they didn't play basketball, and in the spring if they didn't run track, a couple of them did club. I have a couple girls now who have been playing club in Peoria, so they've been playing a lot of volleyball."
   
 And several Blue Bullets are learning to adjust on the fly.
   
 "Some of the girls are playing different positions than they were with the JV team, so we're just trying to get people in their position and used to playing it," Tyrrell said. "Some girls are playing multiple positions, so we are trying them out at each one to see who is going to fit where."
   
 Knoxville held a 13-17-3 overall record in 2019, and Tyrrell, who is in her sixth season at the helm, believes the winning percentage will be better soon.
   
 "I think we'll definitely improve on that," she said. "We just have more experience. We didn't have a lot of varsity experience last year. It's very hard sometimes for girls to jump up from JV to varsity because it's a lot quicker pace.
   
 "We've had a lot of growth over the last year," Tyrrell added. "I'm excited to see how this year will go."
   
 The Blue Bullets were able to get together over the summer, and they should be stronger when, and if, they play games in the spring. Currently, volleyball teams across the state are slated to attend their first official practice in the 2020 season on Feb. 15, 2021, and matches can begin March 5.
   
 "We did weights all summer. They came in twice a week where we had small groups come in for 45-minute sessions," Tyrrell said. "We did that all summer and once they said we could get started at the end of July, we got started and then we started back up as soon as they said we could have open gyms.
   
 "We've been going twice a week expect for the two-week break."

Dr. Ngozi Ezike, director of the Illinois Department of Public Health, said during her appearance Wednesday at Gov. JB Pritzker's COVID-19 news conference that provisions about winter sports would be "released very shortly."
   
 "We will have all that information released very shortly," Ezike said. "I know many people are waiting on that information, so we can't tarry or delay, because decisions have to be made and people need to govern themselves accordingly."
   
 The Illinois High School Association board of directors next meets on Monday, Oct. 19. Practices for winter sports start Nov. 16 and contests have been scheduled for Nov. 30.
   
 The IHSA's executive director Craig Anderson said it has been lobbying persons in state government and providing them with relevant data.
   
 Ezike's response indicates that the IDPH is examining a draft document made and submitted by the IHSA's own sports medicine advisory group. The Chicago Tribune reported that the IHSA proposal included a request to allow interscholastic basketball games provided all the participants were masked.
   
 The IDPH has not made any changes to its All Sports Policy issued in July and made effective on Aug. 15. Under those rules, only sports categorized as lower risk can hold contests. Of the sports on the IHSA's modified winter sports calendar, only bowling, swimming and gymnastics meet the present criteria. Basketball, wrestling, cheerleading and dance do not.
   
 When asked how basketball became categorized as a sport of medium risk, she said the IDPH followed the guidance from the National Federation of State High School Associations.
   
 In fact, the NFHS's own Sports Medicine Advisory Committee, in its guidance for opening high school athletics and activities issued on May 15, placed basketball in its moderate-risk (or middle tier) category.
   
 Prizker followed up with the general observation about expanding activities. "I am deeply concerned," he said.
   
 "I know that they're contemplating how to best bring things back, more sports rather than less," he said.
   
 He then emphasized that any decision about high school sports would be medically-based, not made on a political basis.
   
 Pritzker then related a conference call from the previous day with fellow governors, seeming to infer that other states are looking to put that particular genie back in the bottle. "To the person they have experienced outbreaks" in high school sports or related to high school sports, he said. He said those governors are looking to deal with it after they've already allowed it.
   
 The Illinois Basketball Coaches Association released this week a survey of its members that showed 95% supported starting the basketball season on schedule.
