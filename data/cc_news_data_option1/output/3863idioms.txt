In a similar referendum in 2014, the Swiss narrowly voted in favor of limiting access of EU citizens to live and work in Switzerland. Lawmakers, however, refused to fully implement the referendum fearing a hefty impact on Swiss society and businesses, prompting the People's Party to get the issue back on the ballot again this year.

That the Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based company is pulling out of a thriving market for motorbikes speaks to a troubled international strategy in need of overhaul. It comes as Prime Minister Narendra Modi is pushing his “Make in India” program, with the autos sector (including two-wheelers) as a key part and potentially $23 billion in production incentives on the way. Nonetheless, Toyota Motor Corp. said last week it won’t expand further there.

Amid concerns that the world is distracted, it was perhaps no surprise that the student-led movement Fridays for Future returned to the streets this week for the first major demonstrations for climate action in months.
 Still, island nations have seized on the unusual circumstances to show off what’s at stake.
 The prime minister of Tuvalu, Kausea Natano, delivered his U.N. speech with a vista of turquoise waters and swaying fronds behind him that instantly fired the imaginations of house-bound viewers.
 But the prime minister quickly shattered any dreams. While Tuvalu is free of the coronavirus, the pandemic struck as the island nation was recovering from a pair of tropical cyclones — storms that scientists say are likely to become wetter as the planet warms.
 Tuvalu's highest point is just a few meters (yards) above sea level. The pandemic's effect on the movement of goods exposed food insecurity as local agriculture becomes more difficult with rising sea levels, Natano said.
 “While COVID-19 is our immediate crisis, climate change remains the single greatest threat to the livelihoods, security and well-being of the Pacific and its peoples in the long run,” the prime minister said.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Mookie Betts exited early after getting hit by a pitch, giving the Dodgers a brief scare with the playoffs approaching, and Los Angeles beat the Angels 7-6 on Saturday night following a power outage in the ballpark.
 Joc Pederson hit a go-ahead homer in the sixth inning shortly before the lights went out at Dodger Stadium. The Freeway Series resumed in the top of the seventh after a 25-minute delay.
 “I panicked for two seconds, to be honest,” said Edwin Ríos, who was in the dugout. “It was dark and I couldn’t see anybody.”
 Ríos quickly regained his composure and homered in the seventh, and Will Smith added a solo shot in the eighth, giving the NL West champions 116 homers to lead the majors.
 The Angels closed to 7-6 in the ninth. Jahmai Jones was safe at first on a fielding error by Ríos at third base. Elliott Soto stroked a ground-rule double to deep right, putting Jones on third. Soto and Jones scored on David Fletcher’s double to left off Alex Wood.
 Albert Pujols lined out to right, moving Fletcher to third with two outs. But then Shohei Otani grounded out to Adam Kolarek to end the game. Kolarek earned his fourth career save and first this season.

Was born on a beautiful family farm in Sibley County, MN in 1925. Her parents, Anders and Olga (Klodt) Anderson were hard working Swedish immigrants, and Elaine had two sisters and three brothers. Elaine married her beloved Leo in April 1952. They resided in Silver Spring, MD and raised two children, Caryl and John (Suzanne). In turn, John and Suzanne have a wonderful family Jack (Laura) and Grant. Elaine and Leo returned to Stillwater, his hometown, and the lovely St. Croix Valley in 1980. Their dream retirement together was cut short by Leo's death in 1987. Elaine was a nurse, and enthusiastically cared for people throughout her life. She began her career as a WWII cadet nurse and graduated from the Fairview Hospital School of Nursing (RN) in 1946. She began her career at the original Lakeview Hospital, and then joined Drs. Stuhr, Jenson and Juergens at the Stillwater Clinic until she married Leo. She served as Assistant Director of Nursing at Holy Cross Hospital in Silver Spring for the last 10 years of her career. In retirement, Elaine assisted as a volunteer in establishing the Lakeview Hospice (Stillwater). In light of her full support and grateful use of hospice services, Elaine requested that any memorial donations be directed to Lakeview Homecare &amp; Hospice (Stillwater) in recognition of the hospice program's 30th anniversary. Elaine died on September 23, 2020. Her wit, laugh and generous friendship are deeply missed. Her burial at Salem Cemetery is private. 651-439-5511

Hansel Robles gave up a leadoff walk to Smith in the sixth, setting up Pederson's shot to the lower left-field seats to put the Dodgers back in front, 5-4.
 The third-oldest stadium in the major leagues went completely dark as players left the field after the sixth. The ballpark's emergency generator kicked on, sending power to the ribbon boards, video boards and loge-level concourse.
 “It was spooky," Dodgers starter Tony Gonsolin said. "It got real dark, real fast.”
 Eventually, the stadium's power returned and so did the Dodgers' muscle.
 Jo Adell had Ríos' shot to center field in his glove, which hit the top of the fence, causing the ball to pop out. It was third homer this week for Ríos, a defensive replacement for third baseman Justin Turner in the seventh.
 “It was moments away from a spectacular play, then the ball goes over the wall,” Maddon said.

Prince Harry and Prince William have taken millions in just one year from their father, Prince Charles.
 According to reports, the Prince of Wales spent nearly $7 million in 2019 to extend financial support to Prince William and Harry along with their families.
 Express reported that from the period of April 2019 to March 2020, over $7million were spent on the two which was almost $750,000 more than what was spent a year before.
 British fans of the royals weren’t too pleased with the amount especially the sum spent on Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, now that they have stepped down as members of the British royal family.
 “Now that she has left the monarchy, she should pay Prince Charles back for the designer clothes he bought her,” wrote one user.
 Nearly 95% of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s lifestyle was funded by Prince Charles.
 Emma Forbes, royal expert, told Page Six earlier this year: “If she’s going to live [in the United States], I can’t imagine Prince Charles will go, ‘Listen, go to Givenchy twice a year and get whatever you want and we’ll foot the bill’.”

A devoted father, grandfather, and great-grandfather, 94, passed away peacefully September 13, 2020.      Beloved husband of the late Ruth (nee Rathell) Bassler, devoted father of David Bassler, Steven Bassler (Mindy), Stuart Bassler (Anne), and Michele Bassler. Loving grandfather of Erik Bassler (Katherine), Allison Berg (Rob), Alexa Bassler, and Katie Bassler, and great-grandfather of Rylee Berg, Peyton Berg, and Charlotte Bassler.      Born in his family home in Hamilton, Baltimore City on April 10, 1926, treasured son of Harry L. Bassler Sr. and Edith (nee Benhoff) Bassler.      He met his wife and best friend in the Baltimore Tower Club.      Mr. Bassler left Baltimore Polytechnic, his high school, early to support his family when his father was disabled by a stroke. He finished high school at night after entering the United States Postal Service, where he worked proudly for 40 years, as a letter carrier, assistant station manager, and rural letter carrier in Middle River.      He also worked a second job for many years to make ends meet, by driving a school bus after his shift at the Postal Service was completed.      After retirement from the US Postal Service, Mr. Bassler worked part-time in the armored services field for several years. As a life-long airplane enthusiast, he particularly enjoyed the many flights that he made in that position.      Mr. Bassler proudly served in the Naval Reserve in 1950-1951, based out of Locust Point, in Baltimore.      His children remember fondly Mr. Bassler's love and support, for instance getting up early on Sunday mornings to drive bundles of newspapers to help them complete their deliveries. Family and friends knew him as a kind, gentle man who loved meeting new and interesting people. One of his many cherished maxims was "It takes all kinds of people to make up this world."      He was inspired by the beauty of the outdoors, was a weather enthusiast, Maryland history aficionado and a sailboat buff. Mr. Bassler was a tinkerer and a "Mr. Fixit" and was fascinated with ham radio.      He grew up worshipping with his family at Bethesda Methodist Church and after marriage joined Reformation Lutheran Church, faithfully serving in various roles including the church council and building committee.      With loving memory, a future memorial service will be announced.      Donations may be made to the Chesapeake Bay Foundation in his honor. https://www.cbf.org/

As the analysts put it, the best way to get a toehold has been when new segments emerge. Harley hasn’t rolled into one.

The advent of the streaming economy and the unexpected plight of COVID-19 has been jarring for the owner.
 “This has been the worst I’ve ever seen. We’ve gone through dry spells in the industry before but nobody’s ever seen anything like this,” Smith said. “There is virtually no business. We’re forced to play old classics and there’s not really much of a market for it as the all the new movies keep getting pushed back.”
 While the Princess started playing Christopher Nolan’s “Tenet,” which was supposed to herald a return to normal for the movies, Smith hasn’t seen a turnout of more than 16 people for any individual showing.
 “New movies are kind of hit or miss right now so he’s been running ‘70s and ‘80s movies and classics,” Riley said. “As we approach October, people start thinking about Halloween and scary movies. They go hand in hand.”
 Riley’s big hope is that the horror community comes through for the Princess because he wants to be able to keep going there.
 “With streaming and everything, going to a theatre or drive-in is becoming a niche thing,” he said. “I’ve got a big TV and a soundbar … but there’s just something about going into a theater in the dark and smelling the popcorn and the nachos.
 “It’s nostalgic.”
 When Riley offered to put up the money to give these horror double features a shot, he was amazed.
 “He’s a loyal customer and a good friend,” Smith said of Riley. “I’m just hoping to break even. Right now I’m losing my shirt (with the way business has been going.”
