Terje Rød Larsen apologised to the board of the International Peace Institute after securing donations from foundations related to Epstein and for having borrowed money from him in 2013, Norway’s Dagens Naeringsliv (DN) and Nettavisen reported this morning.The board, which is led by former Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, claims it was not aware of either.Earlier this week Mr Rudd revealed he was “blindsided” and “deeply disturbed” to learn Epstein donated $650,000 to the international think tank that he has been a member of for six years. He claimed he had “no recollection whatsoever” of ever meeting Epstein who was found dead in his Manhattan jail cell last year.In a statement the former PM said he “first learned of contributions from Epstein’s foundations to the IPI in November 2019 through reporting by the Norwegian press.”“I was blindsided by this,” he said. In October last year the board, including Mr Rudd, learned there was a personal loan agreement between Epstein and Terje Rod-Larsen “that existed in 2013”, he said in his statement.Mr Rudd conceded he had been on a teleconference call, also attended by Epstein in 2014, and went to an event in New York while an MP in 2013.Epstein was also invited but Mr Rudd said he has “no recollection whatsoever” of ever meeting him. “Any significant engagement with someone as odious as Epstein must be taken seriously and investigated thoroughly. I have no recollection whatsoever of ever meeting Epstein,” Mr Rudd said in a statement. Mr Rudd joined the IPI board in 2014 and has been chairman since 2018.The donations were reportedly received between October 2011 and May 2019, during which time Epstein had been convicted and was behind bars.“These revelations were deeply disturbing to me and to other members of the Board,” Mr Rudd said.The former Prime Minister claims the IPI did not keep the donations once their source was identified.

The SNL stage isn't always kind to musicians: As with other late-night shows, the energy and sound mix often aren't quite right, and the singers are attempting to win over a crowd that's been watching comedy all evening. But every season, many of the musical guests do something extra with the SNL space and find a way to make something riveting, visually arresting or at least interesting. Still, attempting to subjectively rank such a broad assortment of apples and oranges is a truly cruel and stupid endeavor.

Marilyn Davis, coordinator for the Johns Creek Daffodils 4 Hope effort, said the daffodil has become a symbol of cancer survivorship.
 “The daffodil regenerates and regrows each year in the spring,” Davis said. “There are cemeteries where the daffodils have been blooming for 100 years. Not only are they beautiful, but they are everlasting.”
 The first step, Davis said, is to find a site for the plantings. Once City Hall was selected as a site for one of this year’s plantings, the next step was to find a group to lend a hand.
 The Johns Creek Convention and Visitors Bureau was at the ready.
 CVB Executive Director Stacey Gross said the planting was incorporated into a newly developed series of field trips designed to bring kids out from behind their computers and experience hands-on learning in a safe outdoor environment.
 “Education is a foundational pillar in Johns Creek, so the CVB wants to take this opportunity to show both those within Johns Creek and outside of our city limits the great history, art, science and memorials that are present here,” Gross said.
 The third step in the process is fundraising. Typically, the groups planting the bulbs do their own fundraising year-round.
 The organizations buy the daffodil bulbs in bulk, Davis said. A thousand bulbs can cost around $400 and fill a space the size of a parking spot, or 200 square feet.
 Before the children planted the bulbs, Dr. Neal Kuhlhorst, development officer for CanCare Atlanta, spoke about what the flowers mean and the gift that they were providing to cancer survivors and those battling cancer.
 “CanCare provides the gift of hope to people fighting cancer that they can get healthy again,” Kuhlhorst explained. “These bulbs that you’re putting in the ground are going to become these beautiful flowers, and every year they’re going to come back up. They are symbols of hope, which means that when we plant them, we believe and we hope that they’re going to spring forward and they’re going to blossom.”
 The Rotary Club of Johns Creek partnered with Daffodils 4 Hope for a dig on Oct. 24 around the Peace Pole at Emory Johns Creek Hospital. On Nov. 1, both Johns Creek Methodist Church and Johns Creek Presbyterian Church will sponsor digs.
 Davis said another goal is to plant 58,000 bulbs at the Veterans Memorial in Newtown Park, one for every name on the Wall That Heals memorial.
 Those wishing to learn more about how Johns Creek Beautification can bring the Daffodils 4 Hope program to their school, church or community group, can contact Marilyn Davis at marilyn@johnscreekcpa.com.
 The Johns Creek CVB will host another field trip Nov. 13, the last scheduled outing until April. Parents can register for these field trips on the Johns Creek CVB Facebook page, facebook.com/visitjohnscreek.
