Como parte de las acciones en torno a la contingencia por el coronavirus en el pais, Caintra Nuevo Leon recomendo a las compañias aplicar cambios de turno controlados y graduales en sus areas de produccion.
 El organismo especifico que la industria puede seguir laborando y cumpliendo con sus programas de trabajo considerando algunos ajustes logisticos.
 Por ello pidio evaluar trabajo desfasado o en turnos donde no existan, o bien, si se trabaja un solo turno, evaluar dividir en equipos y desfasar horarios o implementar dos turnos.
 Tambien dijo que otra opcion es aplicar horarios de comida, descansos y cambios de turno controlados y graduales – para que el colaborador no coincida mucho tiempo en un solo lugar.
 De igual manera recomendo desinfectar las herramientas individuales de trabajo, maquinas y herramientas en general ante cada cambio de turno o de personal, y en la medida de lo posible, generar celulas de trabajo que operen de forma aislada y que cada grupo de operadores permanezca en su lugar asignado.
 Ademas, apunto,contar con gel antibacterial suficiente y accesible tambien en las areas operativas, adicional al de filtro de ingreso / salida de personal.
 "En caso de algun colaborador con sintomas o confirmado evaluar aislar toda la zona y personas con las que establecio contacto esa persona mientras se detona una sanitizacion profunda de todo el centro laboral o del area donde se ubico el colaborador", comento el organismo liderado por Adrian Sada Cueva.
 Agrego que cada centro laboral es unico y se recomienda un equipo designado de alto nivel para evaluar estos escenarios asi como un plan de contingencia de continuidad de negocio.
 "Como sociedad, gobierno, empresa y ciudadanos debemos implementar una estrategia integral para reducir los riesgos potenciales por la situacion del coronavirus, tanto de salud como de economia", menciono.
 Los industriales de Nuevo Leon ratificamos el compromiso para apoyar desde nuestra trinchera la seguridad y bienestar de Nuevo Leon, de nuestros socios, sus colaboradores y sus familias, afirmo.
 Ante ello, añadio, el sector industrial ha aplicado los protocolos necesarios para mantener en la mayor medida posible la normalidad en la actividad economica y el nivel de servicio que nuestros clientes y sociedad en general esperan.
 Administrativamente se toman todas las precauciones y medidas necesarias de higiene para proteger y resguardar la salud de nuestros colaboradores; asi como el fomento a trabajo en casa  o bien, el filtro sanitario en los centros laborales: medir temperatura al ingreso (preferencia termometro de no contacto).

MILANO (18 Marzo 2020) - E’ poco più di due settimane che in Italia tira un’aria nuova, patriottica, che in pochi ci dimenticheremo finita questa assurda battaglia contro il COVID-19 che ha colpito la regione Lombardia con il maggior numero di casi positivi. Proprio come una fenice che risorge dalle ceneri, l’Italia si sta accorgendo che unita fa la forza, per questo oggi ci tengo a parlavi di un’azienda che si trova in una delle zone più colpite dal focolaio iniziale del corona virus, stiamo parlando dell’entro terra lodigiano che ad oggi, ha zero contagi. Si tratta della Job and Services una cooperativa con ben più di 100 dipendenti che si è convertita alla produzione di mascherine per fare una grande donazione alla Regione Lombardia. Si, proprio così, questa splendida notizia ci è giunta dal Dirigente di Job and service - “Mi sono reso conto, che nel nostro piccolo tutti possiamo darci una mano, per questo mi sono impegnato a trasformare la mia azienda; Per aiutare gli Italiani, Medici ed infermieri che stanno dando la vita per tornare a vivere come prima e forse meglio di prima.” Cosa intende con -meglio di prima- ? “Intendo dire con valori diversi, nuovi, che avevamo perso: la famiglia, stare insieme, il dedicarci del tempo. Passiamo la nostra vita attaccati agli smartphone e se posso essere sincero, ad oggi dopo 2 settimane di quarantena, posso dire che a volte non ricordo neanche più dov’è. Vivo mia moglie e i miei figli a tempo pieno e sono queste le cose belle della vita”. Si, è decisamente questa l’Italia che ci piace. Forte, Unita e combattiva come non l’avevamo mai vista. Grazie all’impegno di cittadini ed imprenditori così possiamo veramente sperare in un domani migliore. Grazie mille a Job and Services per questo atto di amore dei confronti della nostra Italia.

 The Rams signed Namath thinking he would revitalize his career after a 12-year run in New York (1965-1976), in which he passed for 27,057 yards and 170 touchdowns and led the Jets to an upset over Baltimore in Super Bowl III in January 1969.
 But injuries — Namath added a sore hamstring to his bad knees — took a toll. Namath never threw another pass after he was knocked out of that Bears game, and retired after the season.

Sometimes even doing things you once took for granted – washing dishes or putting on your shoes – can be difficult. Floyd Physical Therapy & Rehab in Calhoun can help you resume your regular activities if you have had an illness, injury or surgery.
 Certified therapists in the Calhoun office care for patients who need rehabilitation after surgery, such as surgery on their knee, hand, hip, shoulder or back. Physical and occupational therapists also work with those who have experienced a work injury, stroke, accident, sprain, strain or sports injury, or who have lingering pain because of a chronic disease such as Parkinson’s disease or arthritis.
 A certified hand therapist can help people who have had surgery, an accident, are experiencing overuse, a nerve disorder or any other problem that limits the use of the hand or arm.
 “Hand surgeons only refer their patients to certified hand therapists after surgery,” said Carol Richardson, OTR/L, CHT. “The Calhoun office is the only location in Gordon County that can provide this service. Because I am a certified hand therapist, patients can come see me as soon as the next day after surgery to begin their rehab,” Richardson said.
 The Calhoun office is one Floyd’s six rehabilitation locations in the seven- county service area that helps patients who need rehabilitation get specialized care close to their home or workplace.
 “Our Calhoun clinic is very much like being welcomed into someone’s home. Our staff works to form a relationship with their patients because they care about helping patients get better,” said Karen Sablon, director of Rehabilitation Services with Floyd. “We want them to feel like they are seeing a family member who has the rehabilitation skills that can help them return to their normal activities of daily living,” Sablon said.
 The office is staffed by an occupational therapist who is certified in hand therapy, a board-certified physical therapist, an on-site office manager and a bilingual therapy aide.
 “Our experienced therapists care for you and know how to help you gain overall improvement in your abilities after the event that might have changed your life,” Sablon said. “They encourage you to work hard. They make sure you feel like you are going to be helped by coming in their doors.”
 “One of the things we enjoy is word of mouth and that people know who we are because we treated their grandmother or their uncle. There is that kind of continuity in care,” Richardson said. “Our philosophy, the tone of the clinic, is that we are going to treat people the way we want to be treated. We have the dream team,” Richardson said.
 The office is in the same building in Calhoun as Floyd Primary Care and Floyd Urgent Care, 251 Ga. Hwy. 53.
 Floyd Physical Therapy & Rehab Calhoun is open Monday-Thursday from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. To make an appointment, call the office at 706-509-3949.

 The images of the burial site are etched in his mind. Graves were dug deep; they looked like pits and trenches. The cemetery was dusted in lime, rows and rows of it. Some graves had the names of the deceased written on paper, others cardboard, a testament to the suddenness of a novel virus that has swept the world.
 Then there are plots of land with no names.
 “I think it was a mass grave,” Behroom said.
 “In my last visit before my friend’s funeral, half of the cemetery was empty land and the graves were spaced but now it’s completely dug up,” he said.

At the end of Tuesday's meeting, commissioners – who sat spaced out around the commission chambers in the interest of social distancing – approved a municipal order allowing Meisel to make some decisions without commission approval on issues such as staffing and building closures.
 "Whatever it takes to keep the city running," Mesiel said, adding that "the last seven days have been a whirlwind."
 The city's response to the pandemic sparked a lengthy discussion, with commissioners Brian "Slim" Nash and Dana Beasley-Brown speaking in favor of closing city buildings immediately, while Mayor Bruce Wilkerson was opposed. Commissioner Sue Parrigin said she thought such decisions should be made by Meisel. City Commissioner Joe Denning, while speaking generally in favor of closings and minimizing foot traffic in city buildings, ultimately came down on the side of allowing Meisel to make such decisions.
 Nash started the lengthy debate by saying that, among other measures, the city should close all city-owned buildings immediately.
 "This, to me, is not an overreaction," he said, in light of health experts recommending minimizing person-to-person interaction as the virus spreads.
 "This is the time we need to protect our employees," Denning said, adding the city should "lock the door on City Hall ... let's do what is right."

Hokutofuji (2-9) went into the bout having beaten Hakuho three times in nine career matchups but has struggled to gain momentum at this tournament since beating yokozuna Kakuryu on Day 2.
 Hakuho (10-1) is chasing a record-extending 44th title but hit a roadblock when he gave up the sole lead after a shock upset on Day 10.
 The other co-leader, No. 13 Aoiyama, kicked off Day 11 action in the top division by beating rookie Kotonowaka and retaining a shot at his maiden title.
 Aoiyama (10-1) was nearly pulled down by the lowly No. 18 _maegashira_ in his initial charge, but the Bulgarian recovered and used his 193-kg frame to drive Kotonowaka (7-4) to the straw and thrust him out.
 The next rung on the leaderboard also remained the same, with Kakuryu headlining a group of four on the heels of Hakuho and Aoiyama.
 Kakuryu (9-2) was made to work by _sekiwake_ Shodai (5-6) but prevailed in the end. The yokozuna was forced back with several strong thrusts but denied Shodai a hold on his belt and kept him upright while pushing him out. Shodai has yet to beat Kakuryu in 13 attempts.
 Asanoyama (9-2) defeated No. 5 Ryuden (4-7) and is now three wins away from meeting one of the benchmarks for an _ozeki_ promotion -- 33 wins over a span of three tournaments.
 The sekiwake countered a strong initial hit from Ryuden then got hold of his opponent's belt before muscling him out.
 No. 3 Mitakeumi (9-2) survived a scare against No. 1 Daieisho (7-4) to claim his third consecutive win since suffering back-to-back losses against the yokozuna on Saturday and Sunday.
 The former sekiwake was taken back and nearly drilled over the straw, but deftly maneuvered to the side and used Daieisho's momentum to send him out instead.
 No. 9 Takanosho (9-2) pushed out No. 12 Ishiura (7-4) to keep his place on the leaderboard.
 Takakeisho (5-6), the lone ozeki, fell to his sixth loss after getting beaten by No. 4 Abi (5-6). Takakeisho employed his tried-and-true pushing technique but had no response for Abi's nimble footwork and was shoved out. The pair have now split their four meetings in the top division.
 Endo improved to 6-5 with a win over No. 5 Onosho (6-5). The komusubi gave up early ground against Onosho, who handed Hakuho his first loss of the meet to zero fanfare on Tuesday, but circled around and bulldozed his opponent off the dohyo.
 The 15-day grand tournament is being held behind closed doors for the first time in the sport's history to help prevent the spread of the new coronavirus.

BOONE — Bailey Whitehead-Price is an artist, be it with watercolors or on the soccer field.
 While Whitehead-Price works with drawings or paintings in the classroom, her canvas is the pitch, where she plays forward on the right side of the field. Her brush or her drawing pencils is the soccer ball.
 Whitehead-Price, who will play collegiately at Mars Hill next year, has scored two goals in three games this season. It is unclear when she’ll get back to the field since the COVID-19 outbreak caused the NCHSAA to suspend all prep events until April 6.
 Whitehead-Price chose Mars Hill during the early signing period during the fall. She plans to study early education and will likely play right forward.
 “I always liked the idea of a small school,” Whitehead-Price said. “I liked the community there and also their team was really welcoming. I like the coach there and it’s close to home. It’s a nice distance and it’s close to Asheville, so it was just a perfect fit.”
 Mars Hill is struggling this season with a 2-13-1 record, but Whitehead-Price has faith that coach Jamey Newsome is bringing in enough talented players to turn the Lions’ fortunes around.
 “This coach is doing a really good job of bringing in good players and starting a really good program,” Whitehead-Price said. “It’s definitely growing a lot and we will do a lot better soon.”
 Watauga faces a similar situation. The Pioneers return several veteran players offensively, but is breaking in several younger players on defense. Watauga dominated Ashe County 9-0 in the first game of the season as the Pioneers’ offense controlled possession most of the game.
 But Watauga has struggled against solid teams lately, falling 4-0 to West Forsyth and 7-1 to Reagan. It’s a new defense to get used to, but Whitehead- Price likes what she’s seen so far.
 “It’s a lot different from last season,” Whitehead-Price said. “It’s the same group of girls since I came in as a freshman, so that’s a lot different. But, there is a lot of potential with our new defenders and they’re doing really well already. I think it’s especially good for them to be working with us with the transitioning, so I’m really excited and they have a lot of potential.”
 Watauga’s offense includes teammates Shaelyn Sheaff, Andie Waugh, Emma Schneider and sophomore Lily Brown. Waugh, Schneider and Whitehead-Price are seniors, while Sheaff is a junior.
 It’s that experience that Whitehead-Price said will carry the Pioneers — should they get to play again.
 “We’ve played together since we were really little,” Whitehead-Price said. “Me, Andie and Emma have played together since we started playing club soccer when we were 11. We all work together and I think it’s how we play together year-round. There are a lot of talented girls on our team, so that works really well.”
 Soccer is the only sport Whitehead-Price has played. She plays the sport all year, saying that the competitive nature of the sport keeps her going back to the pitch.
 “I love the competition,” she said. “I’ve always loved the competition, and I love being with the team and being with the group that we are in. Working together is really fun and I love working towards a goal and sharing it with the team.”

A new data projection of the U.S's best-case coronavirus scenario, where 20% of adults are infected over 18 months, paints a picture of strained hospitals operating at 95% capacity. The very worst-case scenario, with 60% infected over a six-month span, would mean the U.S. could need more than seven times the number of available hospital beds than it currently has.
 The ProPublica review of data from Harvard's Global Health Institute shows that even if 20% of adults were infected, but in the much-shorter six month window, some hospitals would quickly run out of resources to treat those who are expected to need it.
 "The data says that if we fail to act, if we go with the status quo, we are going to be in a lot of trouble - that most hospitals in most communities are going to end up getting overwhelmed," Dr. Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute said.
 He told CBS News' Anna Werner that "we're all going to have to work together" through this national emergency.
 "Every mayor, every governor has to be asking themselves, are they going to be part of the solution or are they going to be part of the problem?" He said.
 ProPublica Deputy Managing Editor Charles Ornstein said one major goal for medical experts is avoiding a situation similar to Italy's, where doctors in the worst-hit regions are reported to have received guidance to only treat patients "deemed worthy of intensive care."
 "When you look at this data, the one thing that becomes crystal clear is that it is essential that we slow down this pandemic and that we try to stretch it out over as long a period as possible," Ornstein said.
 Otherwise, he said, "doctors and hospitals are going to be forced to make decisions they didn't go into medicine for... And essentially, that's going to be relegating some patients to death" in the case of strained resources.
 Though projections say the worst is yet to come, hospitals around the country are already preparing to operate over-capacity. At the Good Samaritan Hospital Medical Center in Long Island, New York, workers set up tents to test people for coronavirus.
 The large hospital has 437 beds, with 64 in the intensive care unit. On any given day, 80 to 85% of the ICU beds are full, already limiting capacity for any influx of coronavirus patients.
 Patrick O'Shaughnessy, a high-level administrator at Catholic Health Services which runs Good Samaritan, said that some of the things they were doing included limiting "less severe acute interventions within the hospital."
 "So things that could be done on an elected basis, perhaps are going to be delayed or cancelled to free up capacity," he said. "This is going to be more of a marathon and not a sprint."

Even though GMOs have been around for nearly 30 years, the United States Food and Drug Administration (USDA) released the first set of rules for GMO labeling in December 2018.
 By 2022, GM foods or foods made with GM ingredients must display the "bioengineered" emblem on the packaging. Implementation of the new labeling began on Jan. 1, 2020 for large food manufacturers and begins on Jan. 1, 2021 for small manufacturers. For both, the mandatory compliance date is Jan. 1, 2022.
 However, the notice clarifies that "For refined foods that are derived from bioengineered crops, no disclosure is required if the food does not contain detectable modified genetic material."
 So just like you'll start seeing (or have already seen) the new nutrition facts label this year, expect to see the new emblem soon. You can also still look for the Non-GMO Project label, a sign that the independent organization has evaluated that food for GM ingredients.
 If you're really worried about eating GMOs, you can keep them out of your diet by eating organic food and avoiding foods with soybeans, canola oil, corn and sugar from sugar beets.
