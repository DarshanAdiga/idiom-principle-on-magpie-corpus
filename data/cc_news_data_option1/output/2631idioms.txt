ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- At the beginning of March, Joey Conicella and Alex Marin were riding high. Their new Orlando restaurant, Hungry Pants, had drawn rave reviews. With revenue rising, they planned to hire more servers. Sunday brunch service was coming soon.
 That was just before the coronavirus struck suddenly, forcing them to close. But in May, as authorities eased safety and social-distancing rules, Hungry Pants reopened at smaller capacity, fueled by hope, hand sanitizer and a government loan.
 Now, a spike in confirmed viral cases is making Conicella and Marin anxious about the future -- for their business and for the region -- even as they keep their restaurant open.
 "It's been a roller-coaster ride," Conicella said glumly.
 For residents across America's Sun Belt -- business owners and workers, consumers and home buyers -- the past three months have delivered about the scariest ride in memory. With confirmed viral cases surging through the region, it's far from clear whether the stops, starts and bumps in the economy have ended. Or are they the new normal? Will the Sun Belt remain gripped by doubt and uncertainty for months or years?
 What is clear is that no one feels able to relax and assume the best.
 It isn't just business owners in the region who fear for the future. It's consumers, too.
 In Scottsdale, Arizona, Jim and Bobbi Moss had been banking on what looked like a promising economic rebound, only to lose some hope and retreat into a strict limit on their discretionary spending. They now make all their meals at home, and online shopping, Bobbi Moss said, is limited to items that "sustain daily living."
 "We're not spending online, saying, 'Gee, it might be nice to have this or do that,' "she said. "We're not doing any of that."
 The couple, who run a tax consulting and financial services business, say many of their clients -- from couples in their 30s to retirees in their 80s -- feel whip-lashed by an economic stall-out after the brief rebound a few weeks ago. Clients are rethinking investments, Jim Moss said, or delaying home purchases. Some are considering reverse mortgages because they worry about their cash flow.
 "Three weeks ago, people were cautiously hopeful," Bobbi Moss said. "Now, it's frustration."
 In Arizona, Gov. Doug Ducey has ordered bars, nightclubs and water parks to close again for at least a month. Those businesses had been allowed to reopen when a previous stay-at-home order expired in mid-May.
 In Texas, too, Gov. Greg Abbott in May had green-lighted one of the country's earliest and most aggressive reopenings. But by the end of June, the state's daily rates of newly confirmed cases and hospitalizations had quadrupled.
 So last week, the governor reversed course. He shuttered bars, restricting restaurant dining and barred elective surgeries in eight counties. On Thursday, he went further: He issued a mandatory face-mask order for most of the state.
 Florida officials have also shut down bars for a second time. Yet the state's approach has been defined by a patchwork of varying rules, with officials in South Florida, where viral cases have spiked, being the most stringent. In Central Florida, by contrast, some theme parks have reopened. Disney's Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom are set to reopen July 11, Epcot and Hollywood Studios four days later.
 Danielle Savin has been a personal witness to the wildly uneven ways in which states have responded to the virus.
 Savin owns two bars -- one in New York, one in Miami -- that were forced to close for months. When the pandemic first hit and New York was the country's epicenter, she feared most for her business there. No longer. Now, it's the Miami location she worries most about. She's required to close it at midnight because confirmed cases in Florida have soared.
 "Being in Florida right now with COVID is like trying to play Pin the Tail on the Donkey at a 5-year-old's birthday," said Savin, co-owner of Bob's Your Uncle, a bar with a neighborhood vibe that had been open a year when the virus struck.
 The business model had to be swiftly changed, with more focus on food, more kitchen staff and a staggering of shifts to comply with restrictions. Sales have declined, though. Savin and her co-owner have been working with their landlord to help with rent payments. Still, she started a GoFundMe page that has raised about $3,000 to help struggling employees.
 "It did feel when we reopened again that we had to open a restaurant from scratch," she said.
 It is a sentiment felt, too, by Joe Ables, who owns Saxon Pub, a live-music venue in Austin, Texas. Ables had closed his doors in March. He didn't reopen even when Texas allowed it at up to 50% customer capacity.
 "I lose less money by staying closed," Ables said.
 He sought and received federal aid to support his six full-time employees. But given that Texas has now shuttered its bars twice, he's settling in for what he fears will be a long dark period for businesses like his. Ables thinks the state will be cautious and likely slow about reopening them again.
 In Austin, which bills itself as the "Live Music Capital of the World," Ables has watched some clubs close for good and musicians and production workers leave the city. The state's second shutdown of bars could inflict further damage.
 "I'm worried about the club scene," he said. "There is permanent damage."
 Even so, Ables said he holds out hope for an eventual rebound, perhaps in 2021.
 "I think we all have to believe," he said, "regardless of whether it's war or famine, that we're going to come through it."

 Alice Neihardt Thompson passed away Saturday, June 27. My heart goes out to Erica, Lynn and family. She was loved by her wonderful family and many friends. I suppose that there are many in the Saddlebred world that never met Alice, but for those who spent much time in the world of Missouri Saddle Horses there was and will always only be one Alice. She was one of those people that left an unforgettable impression. The daughter of a well-known author father and a mother who was a talented sculptor and student of internationally famous artist Rodin. She was brilliant, enthusiastic, tough, gritty, tireless and unrelenting.
 Alice dedicated her life to her love of horses. From her Skyrim farm north of Columbia for decades she infected others with that love. With the guidance of her friend and mentor, Uncle Dick Cook, she learned the craft of training and showing Saddlebred horses. She not only mastered the craft; Alice broke down barriers that set the stage for the women in the show ring today. Fifty years ago, she was showing her beloved stallion Skyrim's Bourbon Stonewall in professional classes against the best male trainers of the era. She pushed into the male dominated world of professional horsemen more than two decades before Michelle brought another stallion, Skywatch, into the ring at Louisville. Alice never seemed to find a barrier that applied to her, and she set that example for anyone who wished to follow.
 Alice always saw things her own way and she saw them clearly. Her enthusiasm was infectious. She brought many young people into the Saddlebred world as a result. Lessons were for everyone who wanted to learn and many did, including those who could not have afforded to be involved in any other barn. The business from her perspective should be accessible to everyone, not just those who had plenty of extra money to spend. In the days of Missouri Saddlebred Shows when there was a show every weekend within two hours of Columbia, it was possible to be a middle-class wage earner and have fun showing a gaited horse from spring through fall. Alice and Uncle Dick always had a horse that would work for anyone and they would work to help new owners to learn how to ride and afford to be a part of showing.
 If you ever talked with Alice you could tell immediately how intensely and passionately she felt about horses, people and the arts that she loved. Whether it was opera, dance, horses or spiritualism, she let you know it was important. There was always a twinkle in those blue eyes and an animation from her petite dancer's form that energized the room. Whether she was talking about a horse, her father's writings, you could feel something there that transcended normal interactions.
 The memories of Skyrim, of Alice and Uncle Dick come back to me often. The stories of horses long since passed, of horsemen from the earlier days of Missouri horse shows were always part of the conversation. I remember hearing about the way to get a horse to rack in a straight line by working them in a corn row, or teaching a naturally gaited Saddlebred to trot by riding them over poles on the ground. I can still see the magnificent Bourbon being led out of that old barn, his beautiful head atop that never-ending neck that elevated into the sky. He stayed in that old barn despite the new barn built down the hill, because \"he liked it better there.\" I still remember the old hackney pony stallion Lucifer and the way he could move despite his 30 plus years when he came out of his stall. Most of all I remember Alice's laugh, and her excitement when one of the horses she had raised was doing well for someone else.
 My mom and dad introduced my brother and sister and I to Alice at a young age. They bought their first show horse from them and they raised several nice colts by Bourbon. I rode my first rack on a spotted pony named High Collar who stayed with us in Moberly for a while. Our lives would not have been as wonderful without her.
 You will be missed Alice Thompson, but your legacy lives on in ways that only a few today may truly understand. We were blessed to have known you. I hope you are sharing your time now with your dad (Flaming Rainbow), mom, Black Elk and Uncle Dick and riding Bourbon in a ring of greats once again.

Moreover, in a development that bodes well for the overall enthusiasm, the institutional portion of the deal was nearly 165 times subscribed. For instance, Singapore's GIC Private Limited subscribed to shares worth 3 billion yuan while the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority subscribed to around 400-million-yuan worth of shares, according to SMIC.
