Eisinger’s group has asked throughout the pandemic for Seattle to reopen all public buildings for restroom use. Sabrina Register, spokesperson for Seattle Public Utilities, did not answer emailed questions about reopening public buildings, or whether the city feels its restroom supply is adequate.
 She did note that Seattle has erected nearly 100 new shelter spaces in tiny house villages, but added that “the need outweighs our available resources” during the pandemic.
 According to Eisinger, some homeless people in the city have resorted to wearing adult diapers or using 5-gallon buckets filled with kitty litter. She pointed to the city’s recent hepatitis A outbreak — as well as the fact that COVID-19 can live in feces — as evidence that the city’s restroom shortage is a public health failure.
 “This is a government responsibility, an obligation to the public to protect people’s health and safety,” she said. “This is a rich city in a rich county, and we still haven’t made available to people regular, dignified simple basics. It is better to meet folks’ needs on a regular basis than to wait until there is a public health crisis.”
 The public restroom crisis is not limited to Seattle, nor did it begin during the pandemic. Those who study the issue say American cities have spent decades divesting from such facilities, leaving private businesses such as Starbucks and McDonald’s to pick up the slack.

47' Ravaglia, rimasto a terra, dopo lo scontro con Addae, fortunatamente si rialza


--DocBreak--
NEW YORK (AP) — Lawyers for Jeffrey Epstein’s former girlfriend asked a judge Monday to stop her accusers from using evidence in the criminal case to boost civil lawsuits by posting materials to the internet.
 The lawyers say attorneys for women who claim Ghislaine Maxwell recruited and abused them should be subject to the same secrecy rules as prosecutors and Maxwell’s defense lawyers.
 The lawyers, though, said it was one topic that prosecutors and defense lawyers for the British socialite could not agree on as they composed a proposed agreement to keep evidence secret prior to a trial scheduled in Manhattan federal court for July 2021.
 The proposed order, submitted to a judge Monday, would prevent prosecutors and Maxwell's lawyers from releasing any information to the internet or elsewhere, including “nude, partially-nude, or otherwise sexualized images, videos, or other depictions of individuals."
 The joint protective order is routine in sex abuse cases.
 But the lawyers said in a letter to the judge that prosecutors have refused to agree that witnesses in the trial and their lawyers should be subject to the secrecy rules.
 Maxwell's lawyers cited current civil litigation between Maxwell and “many of the government’s potential witnesses," saying numerous potential witnesses and their lawyers have already publicly commented about the case.

CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas (AP) " A day after roaring ashore as a hurricane, Hanna lashed the Texas Gulf Coast on Sunday with high winds and drenching rains that destroyed boats, flooded streets and knocked out power across a region already reeling from a surge in coronavirus cases.
 Downgraded to a tropical storm, Hanna hovered over the U.S.-Mexico border with winds near 50 mph (85 kph), the National Hurricane Center said. It was expected to unload as much as 18 inches of rain (45 centimetres) on parts of South Texas and northeastern Mexico.
 Border communities whose health care systems were already strained by COVID-19 cases " with some patients being airlifted to larger cities " found themselves grappling with Hanna.
 Dr. Ivan Melendez, the health authority in Hidalgo County, Texas, was treating a patient overnight at a hospital when he noticed water pooling on the floor.
 'I thought, 'Hey, something's leaking,'' Melendez said. 'The nurse looks at me and says, 'Look behind you.' I look and see this water coming and coming and coming down the wall.'
 The water was flowing through a vent in the room, which had been retrofitted with a fan to create negative pressure and prevent the virus spreading through the hospital.
 After driving home in the storm in the middle of the night, Melendez was trapped Sunday morning in his home by downed trees and had no electricity. He used the phone to discuss whether to place a 58-year-old woman on a ventilator, a decision he felt uncomfortable making without seeing the patient in person.
 'You look at the people's eyes,' he said. 'You'll know if they're in despair.'
 A community building known as the 'Dome' in the border town of Mercedes was set aside for evacuees who had tested positive for COVID-19 or were exposed to the virus. Across the region, shelters were also opened in hotels, schools and gyms.
 Henry Van De Putte, CEO of the Red Cross' Texas Gulf Coast chapter, said the organization would open more shelters with reduced capacity to ensure social distancing. Volunteers and people seeking refuge will undergo temperature checks, and a medical professional will be assigned to each location, he said.
 He emphasized that people should not delay seeking help because of the virus.
 'Yes, coronavirus provides risk, but so does floodwater, so does not having electricity, so does not having required medications," he said. 'We're doing everything we can do possible to make it a safe environment."
 Coastal states scrambled this spring to adjust emergency hurricane plans to account for the virus, and Hanna was the first big test. Gov. Greg Abbott said Saturday that some people in need of shelter would be given hotel rooms to keep them apart from others.
 Abbott announced Sunday that the Federal Emergency Management Agency approved an emergency declaration that will provide federal aid.
 The first hurricane of the 2020 Atlantic season blew ashore as a Category 1 storm late Saturday afternoon with winds of 90 mph (145 kph) not far from Port Mansfield, which is about 130 miles (210 kilometers) south of Corpus Christi.
 Parts of South Texas had gotten at least 9 inches (23 centimeters) of rain, including Cameron County, which includes Brownsville.
 Myrle Tucker, 83, tried to ride out the storm in a powerboat docked in a Corpus Christi marina. But winds and rain blew out the vessel's windows. Eventually rescuers in a dinghy were able to reach him and bring him to shore.
 Tucker was standing in the marina Sunday holding a cup of coffee. Many other boats had been flooded and lashed by the storm. He recalled telling the rescuers he wasn't sure he would be able to climb out of his boat.
 'They picked me up,' he said. 'They carried me like a box of napkins.'
 The Coast Guard helped rescue a couple without injuries after their sailboat began taking on water Saturday evening in a harbor near Corpus Christi.
 More than 155,000 customers were without power Sunday afternoon throughout South Texas, including Corpus Christi, Harlingen and Brownsville, according to AEP Texas.
 Corpus Christi is in Nueces County, where health officials made headlines when they revealed that 60 babies tested positive for COVID-19 from July 1 to July 16. Farther south in Cameron County, more than 300 new cases have been reported almost daily for the past two weeks. The past week has also been the county's deadliest of the pandemic.
 Hanna came nearly three years after Hurricane Harvey blew ashore northeast of Corpus Christi. Hanna was not expected to be as destructive as Harvey, which killed 68 people and caused an estimated $125 billion in damage in Texas.
 Mexico's northeasternmost states, Tamaulipas and Nuevo Leon, also took precautions ahead of the storm. Tamaulipas disinfected shelters to try to avoid spreading COVID-19, authorities said.
 In the Mexican city of Matamoros, across from Brownsville, volunteers kept a close eye on Hanna as the rains shook tents in a refugee camp housing an estimated 1,300 asylum seekers, including newborns and elderly people. They have been waiting for months for court dates under a U.S. immigration policy that requires them to remain in Mexico.
 In the Pacific Ocean, meanwhile, Hurricane Douglas closed in on Hawaii over the weekend.

Salaries and benefits declined $1,518,000, or 9%, during the quarter ended June 30, 2020 compared with the first quarter of 2020 and increased $1,765,000, or 13%, compared with the second quarter of 2019. The decline in salaries and benefits during the second quarter of 2020 compared with the first quarter of 2020 was primarily attributable to lower incentive plan costs, lower costs related to health insurance and retirement plan benefits, and the deferral of a portion of salary costs related to the origination of PPP loans. The increase in salaries and benefits during the second quarter of 2020 compared with the second quarter of 2019 was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Citizens First.
 Occupancy, furniture and equipment expense declined $100,000, or 3%, during the second quarter of 2020 compared with the first quarter of 2020 and increased $269,000, or 8%, compared to the second quarter of 2019. The increase during the second quarter of 2020 compared with the second quarter of 2019 was primarily due to the operating costs of the Citizens First branch network.
 FDIC premiums increased $123,000, or 100%, during the second quarter of 2020 compared with the first quarter of 2020 and declined $122,000, or 50%, compared with the second quarter of 2019. The change during the second quarter of 2020 to both comparative periods was related to credits received from the FDIC during the first and second quarters of 2020. The credits received were due to the reserve ratio of the deposit insurance fund exceeding the FDIC targeted levels. No credits were received during the second quarter of 2019.
 Advertising and promotion expense declined $189,000, or 17%, in the second quarter of 2020 compared with the first quarter of 2020 and declined $54,000, or 6%, compared with the second quarter of 2019. The decline in the second quarter of 2020 compared with the first quarter of 2020 was largely related to an overall decline in advertising expense due in part to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially mitigated by an increased level of contributions.
 Intangible amortization declined $51,000, or 5%, during the quarter ended June 30, 2020 compared with the first quarter of 2020 and increased $107,000, or 13%, compared with the second quarter of 2019.  The increase in intangible amortization in the second quarter of 2020 compared with the second quarter of 2019 was attributable to the Citizens First acquisition completed during 2019.
 Other operating expenses declined $580,000, or 13%, during the second quarter of 2020 compared with the first quarter of 2020 and increased $637,000, or 19%, compared with the second quarter of 2019. The decline during the second quarter of 2020 compared with the first quarter of 2020 was largely impacted by lower training and education expenses and reduced business travel and entertainment expenses, resulting from the effect of the travel restrictions and slowdown of economic activity related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in the second quarter of 2020 compared with second quarter of 2019 was largely attributable to the Citizens First acquisition.

For some years now Professor Jenny Hocking, a political scientist who is absorbed with the dismissal of the Whitlam government in 1975, has been trying to get the Archives to release the letters from and to the Queen at that time, which have been kept from public scrutiny. The Government argued that they were privy to the Queen. Professor Hocking's FOI requests finally succeeded, and now we can read them all. One side of the dispute, which continues, says that they show how the Queen was deeply involved in the dismissal. The other says that the letters absolve the Palace from any involvement. I haven't read them all, and I rather sit on the fence in this one, with a leaning toward the Governor-General. What really fascinates me is the sheer number of letters, more than two hundred.

With more than one-fifth of Missouri's COVID-19 cases tallied in the past week, Columbia health officials are urging people to wear masks, follow social distancing guidelines and remain in quarantine for at least 14 days after possible exposure.
   
 Elsewhere in the state, local leaders are pulling back on steps to reopen businesses and other activities, with St. Louis limiting gatherings to 50 people or fewer beginning Friday.
   
 In Boone County, where more than half of cases involve people under 30, the Columbia-Boone County Department of Health and Human Services reported Monday that positive rates for tests are down from their peak but remain high.
   
 From July 8 through Sunday, 93 of 454 new cases were among people 19 and younger, and 106 among people 30 to 44, a prime age for parents of the younger group.
   
 "Yes, we are definitely seeing spread among family units, or more generally, household contacts," wrote the health department's assistant director, Scott Clardy.
   
 Statewide over the past two weeks, the share of cases among people 20 to 29 years old has increased by about 800 more than if their share had remained unchanged.
   
 Contact tracing is showing that eight or nine people are being infected by each case in that age group, state Health Director Randall Williams said, and in many instances, they were not wearing masks when exposed.
   
 In Boone County, health officials are reporting that people know who infected them when contact tracers call, Williams said.
   
 "The temptation to go out in the summer and congregate is great," Williams said during a briefing with Gov. Mike Parson. "We really, really need them to follow those basic public health measures and that is not happening."
   
 In Boone County, for the week ending Thursday, 7.2 percent of people tested were positive for the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. That is up from 6.2 percent the previous week but down from 16 percent during the first week of July.
   
 A rate above 5 percent is concerning, the department stated in a news release.
   
 Since July 10, Columbia has required people to wear face masks in public and private indoor spaces and the decline in the positive rate could be partially a result of the mask mandate, the release stated.
   
 But masks are not a substitute for social distancing.
   
 "We are hopeful that more people wearing masks will help lower our rates of infection, but it's important to continue all other efforts to remain COVID aware, including social distancing to the greatest extent possible, regularly washing your hands, and staying home if you are sick," said local health department Director Stephanie Browning.
   
 When someone in a household tests positive, Clardy wrote, they should keep to one room of the house, not share the bathroom. Everyone else should quarantine for 14 days and get tested.
   
 "We recommend close contacts be tested at 7 to 9 days after their last contact with the confirmed case, but even if they test negative, they need to stay in quarantine for the entire 14 day period as they could become infectious at any time during those 14 days," Clardy wrote.
   
 Boone County is currently under a health order, in effect until Aug. 10, prohibiting restaurants and bars from offering standing counter or buffet service and limiting gatherings to no more than 100 people.
   
 Personal care facilities like salons may only operate at 50 percent capacity or a total of 50 people, whichever is fewer.
   
 During the Monday briefing, Parson urged counties to get federal COVID-19 funds to local health departments to increase contact tracing. The state has moved more than $500 million to counties, but only 17 of 81 local health departments surveyed have received cash to support their prevention efforts, he said.
   
 The Boone County Commission is working out the details of providing $1.8 million to the department, with $810,000 for testing uninsured people and hiring 40 temporary staff, Clardy said.
   
 Missouri reported 1,123 new infections on Monday, bringing the seven-day total to 9,426 out of 43,050 reported since March. St. Louis County, which reported 520 new cases Sunday and 157 more on Monday, is issuing new orders limiting crowd sizes, ordering bars to close early and urging parents to teach their children virtually if possible when the school year starts.
   
 St. Louis County Executive Dr. Sam Page said the new restrictions would take effect at 5 p.m. Friday.
   
 St. Louis County has 11,152 cases by the state's tally, more than a quarter of the state's total. The number of infections is thought to be far higher because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected with the virus without feeling sick.
   
 "This is serious," Page said. "This will overwhelm our community. This will overwhelm our hospitals. The decisions we are making today will not bend the curb for at least three weeks."
   
 The new restrictions include limiting gatherings to no more than 50 people, rolling back the number of people allowed in businesses, closing bars starting at 10 p.m. and working with business to ensure they are complying with the rules.
   
 "If businesses are not playing by the rules, they should not be open," Page said.
   
 Page said people waiting for test results must quarantine and that spaces will be found for teachers to quarantine if needed. There also will be a push to ensure health care providers are reporting their testing promptly.
   
 Page also urged parents to strongly consider avoiding in-person schooling for their children unless absolutely necessary.
   
 "Please know that we are trying to take as many steps as we can to flatten the curve and provide a safe option for our parents later this year to have an in- school in classroom setting for their students if they chose that option," he said.
   
 "But even with these steps, even with that knowledge, it is my recommendation as a parent that parents who can choose a virtual option if it is available. And I know that that virtual options will be difficult for many."
   
 But he also acknowledged virtual learning isn't a good fit for many families.
   
 "Some parents who have child care needs and some parents who have kids with special needs," he said. "They need that support structure and that predictability in order for their kids to be able to learn."

SILVER SPRING, Md. (AP) — Less than two months after their office romance ended, Ahmad Kazzelbach began tampering with the email and social media accounts of the Baltimore woman who broke up with him. He changed her Instagram username to include the word “whore.”
 That was only the start of a vicious cyberstalking campaign that would escalate steadily over the next year. Before FBI agents arrested her ex- boyfriend, the woman was wrongfully arrested twice and spent four nights in jail based on a string of false police reports that he made.
 Kazzelbach, 27, of Pasadena, Maryland, was sentenced on Monday to four years in prison for his online harassment of the woman, who is identified by her initials “J.K.” in court records.
 U.S. District Judge James Bredar said Kazzelbach repeatedly lied to police and court officials to essentially “wage war” against his ex-girlfriend.
 “He took the campaign to such an extreme extent that he used his considerable skill to alter and manipulate evidence and succeeded in weaponizing the criminal justice system against this person,” Bredar said. The judge departed from sentencing guidelines that called for a lighter prison sentence ranging from 30 to 37 months.
 Kazzelbach's ex-girlfriend told the judge that she was horrified that he could get her falsely arrested and jailed twice. She felt helpless behind bars.

 Voters who still need to complete their ballot need to make sure that they select candidates from one political party only, that they completely darken the oval opposite each choice using a black or blue pen, and that they do not vote for more candidates than indicated under each office title. In an in- person voting setting at the precinct, voters making these mistakes would have their ballot rejected by the voting machine and they would have a chance to correct them. Obviously, absentee voters do not have that chance.

"We kept [it] in the tank and just made sure that nobody took him in the back for dinner," server Angie Helbig told NPR.
 As the cerulean crustacean crawled around with its humdrum tank-mates, restaurant management contacted their corporate office which in turn reached out to the Monterrey Bay Aquarium's Seafood Watch Program. Both Red Lobster and the Akron Zoo partner with the program, which promotes sustainably sourced seafood. By Friday, Seafood Watch had connected the two, and the Zoo's aquarium staff were rallied.
 "They sprung into action," Akron Zoo Animal Care Manager Kathleen Balogh told NPR. "[They] prepared a suitable area and made a cage so the lobster would feel comfortable."
 Balogh and a colleague loaded up a giant cooler with cold saltwater and made the 15-minute drive over to help relocate the Red Lobster's blue lobster – named Clawde after the chain's mascot.
 "There is a little bit of wear and tear from its journey," Balogh said, noting that the lobster is otherwise in good health and adjusting to its new surroundings. She says zoo staff will keep a close eye on their cobalt charge as she — the lobster is female — goes through her next molting cycle where she will shed and renew her shell, what Balogh calls a particularly precarious time for crustaceans.
 For the time being, the zoo's indoors areas – including Clawde's tank – are closed to the public as a pandemic-related precaution. Balogh says she hopes that once the lobster has gotten comfortable in its cage, they'll be able to find a way to put the unique specimen on public display.
 Balogh notes there might only be a one in 200 million chance of capturing a blue American lobster in the wild. But Angie Helbig, who has worked at the Cuyahoga Falls Red Lobster for 28 years (and had never before seen a blue lobster) says there's another reason Clawde was spared a butter-smothered end.
 "Normally I would have not known that it was something special," she said. But then she and Lora Jones remembered the name of a prized service award for long-time employees the two of them had earned last year: the blue lobster award.

Yes, good evening, Jean-Jacques and Chris. So two questions for me, please, so one on operating deleverage, and then one on trading. So operating deleverage, which was, I guess, one of the surprises of the statement tonight is, Jean- Jacques you mentioned that the benefit of some of your cost control initiatives only start to bear fruit in the – mostly in the second quarter. So, should we assume that the magnitude of the operating deleverage in the second half should be sensibly lower than the 2.5 times kind of posted in H1? And if you could please give us a little bit of color on the main deltas, you know, between H1 and H2 in terms of rents and personal expense and A&P? And my second question relates to trading, you just mentioned that you're, I guess, cautiously optimistic about the future. So to what extent, you know, recovery has continued so far in Q3 and that could we have a scenario in which, you know, sales could turn positive by the end of the year, you know, despite the disruption in travel retail that you just mentioned, and assuming no second wave in terms of COVID?

A nearby pet supply store used to let homeless people use the restroom, but that changed during the pandemic. Conditions improved markedly when the city placed a portable restroom and handwashing station near the camp, but Eric said many more parts of town still lack similar amenities.
 “It doesn’t smell like urine out here anymore,” he said. “Forty to fifty people having to (urinate) and (defecate) every day, what do you expect? I’m surprised we don’t see these (portable stations) all over the place.”
 Seattle officials say the city has set up 32 portable toilets during the pandemic, bringing the total to 114 citywide. Another 107 restrooms are available at city parks. At the five reopened library restrooms, nearly 6,000 patrons have taken advantage of the facilities, according to the library system, which has been tracking usage.
 But advocates for the homeless say the city has come nowhere close to meeting the need.
 “All the public libraries, all the public buildings, all the coffee shops — we’re probably down thousands of restrooms,” said Alison Eisinger, executive director of the Seattle/King County Coalition on Homelessness. “There’s no way to make up for that with handwashing stations and a few port-a-potties.”

He writes that he always discusses the Kerr letters with the Queen, who always sends her best wishes. There is a tone almost of paternalism in them, but it's not over the top when you remember when this was, when you consider who is writing, and who is receiving the letters.

 The rise in child deaths worldwide would reverse global progress for the first time in decades. Deaths of children younger than 5 had declined steadily since 1980, to 5.3 million around the world in 2018, according to a UNICEF report. About 45 percent of the deaths were due to undernutrition.

Ben Valdez, a Los Angeles-based ride-hailing driver and an organizer with Rideshare Drivers United, said he carries an empty bottle in the car in case of emergency — along with lots of disinfectant wipes and hand sanitizer.
 “I literally have to plan my evening around being near a restroom,” he said “If I know I have no restroom available to me, I can’t drink anything or eat anything. I’ve had numerous occasions where I’ve had to decline a ride because I’ve been in that situation.”
 Valdez said many gas stations now have “out of order” signs on their restrooms — likely an effort to limit transmission risk rather than an actual plumbing issue. Some hotels have limited access to lobby restrooms as well. With a driving radius that often reaches 100 miles, Valdez has found no institutions he can consistently count on to find a facility.
 In San Francisco, officials have expanded the city’s Pit Stop program, which they think is a leading model for providing restroom access. The city set up 37 toilets to bolster the 24 already in place before the pandemic. The toilets are staffed by nonprofit partners, who clean them between each use and monitor for drug use and overdoses.
 Since the city began staffing toilets, said Beth Rubenstein, spokesperson for the San Francisco Public Works Department, the number of flushes per day went up “exponentially.” In neighborhoods where the Pit Stop toilets have been installed, the city has seen fewer calls for waste cleanup on the streets.
 “It ensures cleanliness and safety,” Rubenstein said. “I know that the increased number of toilets (during the pandemic) has been very much used. Our essential workers use them as well, including our Public Works staff.”

About a third of it is or little bit more is belt tightening and that's something that if volume doesn't come back, we could continue to manage. If volume comes back, sorry, on the more volume really pieces, obviously, that part will go up.

St. Kitts and Nevis are among the former British colonies, which continue to celebrate the abolition of slavery in the British Caribbean islands on Monday, August 1, 1838. August 1, 1970, was a Saturday, but everything was in place for the celebration on Monday August 3, that included horse-races at Indian Castle. Nevisians were on their way home from England, the US Virgin Islands, and elsewhere. Kittitians, were traveling to Nevis for the fun too. Teachers were on board, visitors were on board, including three nuns, and the regular hucksters. That afternoon more women than men, were aboard the ferry. Ms. Dulcita Browne had five of her children with her. The rushing water took them from her arms. She survived, and helped another lady she saw in the water. They held on to a crocas-bag containing some breadfruit. A group of excellent swimmers were in the captain’s room having a birthday party. With the sudden sinking they died there. Months later, their skeletons were seen in the captain’s room on the sunken ferry. Two of the women who died were hucksters in their late thirties. Each left eight young children to be cared for.

It’s beyond the pale.”
 Banks noted that businesses may be less likely to allow homeless people to use their facilities, and people of color also are less assured of gaining access. For girls and women, urinating discreetly in the absence of restrooms is not always possible.
 “It’s a class issue, it’s a race issue, it’s a gender issue,” she said. “(During the pandemic,) middle-class white people who normally have greater access to toilets in public spaces are all of a sudden being denied access. Now they’re woke to it.”

Yes. I mean, I think, largely the cost improvements we've seen have been sustainable operational efficiencies schedule, longer laterals, more combo development and a consistent well design that we have put in place. So, we feel pretty good about it. I mean, one thing that's also worth highlighting, in the first and second quarter of this year, as we broke out some new electric frac fleets, one of these fleets was new and took us a few months of just breaking them in. So, I mean, the efficiencies that we saw in the field on that crew were -- I mean, that crew was our worst performer, when we started back in January. Now, that crew is our best performer. And that's a testament to the quality engineers we have here. And our completions team have been able to take advantage of this new technology and develop it to meeting the efficiency. So, I mean this is one of those things we're looking at. We talk about the averages of what we report and we're obviously exiting at higher rates. That's sort of the dynamic that's at play on the completions front, which is the biggest part of our spend. Over 60% of our spend is on completion. So, I feel pretty good about where that's at. And that's also the area of our business where we have the most control over service cost inflation, because we've got the most amount of procurement setup in place for that segment of our business.

"We've been drafting in the low 20s and the 30s or something forever, and that pick has never allowed us that kind of opportunity.

He would probably take a No. 1 [draft pick] — and it'd probably take something else. Shoot, we can get this guy to play on our team right now."
 Of course, it took not just one No. 1 pick but two to get Adams, as well as third-rounder and safety Bradley McDougald, with Seattle also getting a fourth-rounder back.
 The position of the picks Seattle traded to the Jets will go a long way toward determining the perception of the trade.
 Jets general manager Joe Douglas told reporters in New York on Monday what would be expected — that Seattle offered more than anyone else to get Adams, who went on the trade block after falling into a dispute with the team over having his contract extended.
 Seattle, Douglas said, was the most "aggressive in their pursuit" of Adams, who will team in Seattle's back end with Quandre Diggs.
 The task now for Seattle is also to eventually sign Adams to a new contract keeping him with the team longer than the two years remaining on his current deal.

It had just been me and her for a while," said Young-Holmes.One of their favorite things to do was to play games."We loved playing video games together," said Young-Holmes.Her grandmother formed a strong bond with her only grandchild."I didn't give birth to her, but she was just like my own child," said Atkins.Kimora and her mom had a tradition, a weekly shopping trip to the mall. Her favorite store was Justice."She loved shopping for clothes. She never lets me pick out her stuff, so she would see what she wants and just pick that out," said Young-Holmes.On July 11th Kimora wasn't feeling well. Days later, the family went into town for a much different reason."We took her to the hospital, the children's pediatric," said Young-Holmes." They did a urine test and took her temperature."Kimora's temperature was 103 degrees. The mom said her daughter was never tested for COVID-19."I thought they would have jumped on that when they saw here fever," said Young-Holmes.Instead, the little girl was diagnosed with a urinary tract infection. A few days later, after a family shopping trip, they returned home, ate, played some video games, then Kimora asked to take a nap.She filled their home with love and laughter. That all changed on the afternoon of July 17, when she didn’t wake up from her nap."I was shaking her, yelling at her," said Young-Holmes. "I yelled at my mom and told her to come in here because Kim is not breathing."Kimora's grandmother said she started performing CPR."I was just trying to bring her back. I tried, I tried everything I could to bring her back," said Young-Holmes.The ambulance arrived to take Kimora and her family to the hospital."On the way, I was just hoping and praying that they could just get her back," said Young-Holmes.The family ultimately heard the news."They did all that they can," said Young-Holmes.The family still did not know the cause of death for this healthy little girl."After she had passed away, they tested her, and that's when they told me she was positive for COVID," said Young-Holmes.She said she tried to trace everyone she and her daughter had been in contact with but could not find a positive case. Young-holmes said the death is still fresh."At this point, I have no idea. I'm just still pretty much stuck in the now," said Young- Holmes.Her mom said she does not know if she'll ever get over this tragedy. Although the nation may know Kimora as the youngest person in the state of Florida to die of COVID-19, her family will remember her as more than just a statistic. Instead, they will remember her as a loving daughter, a bubbly young girl whose bright future was cut short.If you would like to donate to the family’s official GoFundMe page, click here.Copyright 2020 WCJB via Gray Media Group, Inc.

RIDGELAND, Miss. (AP) — A Republican state representative, a sheriff and a Mississippi Board of Health official on Monday urged those who support some form of medical marijuana in Mississippi to vote for the more restrictive of the two proposals that will appear on the ballot in November. Rep. Jill Ford, Madison County Sheriff Randy Tucker and Ed Langton of the Mississippi Board of Health are against medical marijuana and said Initiative 65, which earned its place on the ballot by a citizen petition, is dangerous, allows “pot shops” to pop up in the state near schools and churches and increases access for people who will abuse the drug. “Law enforcement is overburdened already. I can promise you, we are pushed to the limit with the manpower, resources and the backing of the law as it is. We are fixed to open pandora's box,\" Tucker said at a press briefing in the parking lot of the First United Methodist Church in Ridgeland. The three leaders said Alternative 65A, on the other hand, offers more conservative regulations and legislative oversight over where and how much of the drug will be sold in the state, as well as who will be able to obtain it. “65A would give people who are in favor of medical marijuana a responsible pathway for accessing it,” said Ford, a Republican from Madison. More than 220,000 people signed petitions to put Initiative 65 on the November ballot.
