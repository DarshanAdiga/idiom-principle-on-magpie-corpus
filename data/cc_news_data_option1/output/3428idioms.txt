The team played as Pailan Arrows for the next couple of seasons due to sponsor commitments. Sukhwinder Singh was in charge in 2011-12 season and they finished 13th among 14 teams, avoiding relegation thanks to their immunity. It must be noted that the Arrows lost the likes of Jeje, Lalrindika and Gurpreet before that season. CS Sabeeth finished as the joint-top Indian scorer with nine goals that included a hat-trick against Chirag United Kerala.

A school gardening program that started four years ago at West Central Elementary School in Joplin is growing as more schools come on board and establish gardens cared for by students with the help of community members.                          Michael Wischmeyer, a Joplin architect and founder of the Joplin School Garden Cooperative, on Saturday was at West Central with friends from the Joplin Daybreak Rotary Club expecting to spend a couple of hours clearing the raised beds for fall and winter planting.                          A severe thunderstorm that blew through just before 10 a.m. delayed the Rotary volunteers’ work for a few minutes, but they were finished in less than an hour thanks to the work of West Central staff and students earlier last week.

LOS ANGELES — Actress Joanna Kerns, who gained fame in the 1980s and ‘90s as matriarch Maggie Seaver on the sitcom “Growing Pains,” and architect-author Marc Appleton have sold their home in Montecito for $8.35 million.                          Called Villa Corbeau, the Mediterranean-style residence is about a five-minute stroll from the new home of Prince Harry and the former Meghan Markle.                          Designed by Appleton and built in 2006, the graceful two-story home takes its cues from the country estates of northern Italy and southern France. Beamed ceilings, wrought-iron fixtures and Tuscan hues bring a rural tone to the interiors, a theme echoed in the kitchen’s butcher-block counters and antique-finished cabinets. Arched French doors bring garden views into the family room.                          Outside, gardens and mature landscaping surround the home. Pathways lined with decomposed granite wind through various outbuildings including a rose garden, a pool pavilion, an arbor and a potting shed. Amid the backdrop are several dozen mature oaks, Italian cypress and pepper trees.                          Kerns has pivoted to the director’s chair in recent years, helming episodes of “Pretty Little Liars,” “Scrubs” and “The Goldbergs,” among others.                          Appleton, who has offices in Santa Monica and Montecito, this year co-wrote the third book in the “Master Architects of Southern California 1920-1940” series, which focuses on the works of Wallace Neff. His fourth book in the series, on architect Paul Revere Williams, is due out this year.                          Courteney Cox finds a friend for West Hollywood condo                          While Matthew Perry is still looking for a match for his Century City penthouse, fellow “Friends” star Courteney Cox has checked out of her own high-rise digs.                          The actress last month cut an off-market deal, selling her longtime residence at the Sierra Towers building in West Hollywood for $2.9 million.                          Owned by Cox for more than a decade, the condominium is next door to Dame Joan Collins’ former residence, which sold three years ago for $4.4 million.                          Found on the 25th floor, the unit has one bedroom, two bathrooms and sweeping views of the Hollywood Hills. Floor-to-ceiling windows and an open-concept floor plan are among the features of note. Two covered parking spots were included with the 1,315-square-foot unit.                          Originally built as an apartment building, the 31-story Sierra Towers has been home to stars such as Cher, the late Diahann Carroll, Lily Collins, David Lee and Jerry Leiber, among others. The high-rise, on the western end of the Sunset Strip, features amenities such as a concierge service, a gym and a swimming pool.                          Cox, 56, is set to reprise her role as news reporter Gale Weathers in the upcoming “Scream 5” sequel. Earlier this year, it was announced that she and the rest of the main “Friends” cast will appear in a reunion special on HBO Max.                          WHAT’S GOING ON NEXT DOOR?                          Nirav Tolia, founder of the social networking service Nextdoor, has a new reason to reach out to his neighbors. The entrepreneur just listed his Italian Renaissance-style home in the San Francisco neighborhood of Pacific Heights for $25 million.                          That’s more than triple the $7 million he paid for it in 2011.                          The dramatic price hike comes after an ambitious remodel Tolia oversaw during his stay, introducing a chic modern style while keeping some original details in place. The house was built in 1916 by George Applegarth, the architect behind San Francisco Bay Area buildings such as the Palace of the Legion of Honor, the Clift Hotel and the Spreckels mansion.                          Tucked behind a 150-pound iron gate, the five-level home boasts a crisp facade that’s about 49 feet wide. Inside, formal living spaces with oversize windows take in views of San Francisco Bay and the Golden Gate Bridge.                          Original heirloom coffered ceilings top the living room, and the adjacent great room combines a dining room with custom drapes, a family room with back-lit bookcases and a kitchen with marble counters.                          The primary suite — one of six bedrooms and 6.5 bathrooms — spans the entire top floor. It comes with a chandelier-topped foyer, a glass office and floor-to-ceiling windows with sweeping views. An elevator and tiered garden complete the property.                          LOSING A PIECE OF THE PIE                          Actor Eddie Kaye Thomas, known for his role in the “American Pie” film franchise, has sold his canal-view home in Venice for a little over $2.55 million.                          He bought it in 2016 for about $2.59 million.                          The blue-shingled bungalow, which dates to 1910, has high ceilings, exposed beams, three bedrooms and two bathrooms. Midcentury-style drum fireplaces lend a vintage look to the living room and primary bedroom. Skylights flood the updated kitchen and living spaces with natural light.                          Outside, there’s rooftop decking that overlooks the canal and a private patio. A carport sits at the rear.                          Thomas, 39, has been busy of late with appearances on such shows as “This Is Us,” “Outmatched” and “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.” The series “Scorpion” and “American Dad!” are among his other recent credits.                          HOSS AND LITTLE JOE WOULD BE PROUD                          In the Lake Tahoe area, the scenic estate that served as a backdrop for the beloved TV western “Bonanza” has sold for $38 million.                          Once used to portray the fictional Cartwright family’s Ponderosa Ranch, the 24-acre property is set along the east shore of Lake Tahoe in Zephyr Cove. The estate looks a bit different these days, with two homes built in 2004 combining for nine bedrooms and 9.5 bathrooms across more than 18,000 square feet.                          A dramatic gated motor court approaches the stone-clad mansion, which opens to formal living spaces with beamed ceilings, hand-carved fireplaces and ornate chandeliers. Picture windows bring views of the water into the living room, dining room and kitchen.                          Other highlights include a wine cellar, craft room, movie theater, gym, two offices and a game room with a wet bar. A second-story deck hangs off the backside of the home, overlooking a stretch of sandy beach that leads to a private dock with a boat lift.                          The property had waffled on and off the market for the last five years, originally listing for $59 million in 2016 along with another property before a series of price cuts divided the land and brought the tag down to $39.9 million.                          “Bonanza” ran for 14 seasons and 431 episodes from 1959 to 1973, making it NBC’s longest-running western show.

Jam session is an opinion forum offering comments on issues from a group of Plymouth residents. It appears on the Forum pages in the Weekend edition of the OCM.                                                                          The newspaper poses a question to the group each week, and participants choose whether to comment. This column is designed to bring the voices of well-informed residents into the Forum page to address issues, one at a time.                                                                          Participants cross the local political spectrum and live throughout the town. Some are current or past Town Meeting representatives, and all are active in the community. We hope their diverse points of view will encourage discussion of the issues Plymouth faces.                                                                                                                                                     ?                                                                          Should Plymouth schools rethink hybrid?                                                                          A group of parents and teachers is calling on school officials to rethink their hybrid school reopening plan, saying the plan to send students to classes part-time is not safe enough. The group demands that the School Department at least offer an alternative that allows students in all grade levels to learn from local teachers remotely. What do you think?                                                                                                                                                     Pat Adelmann                                                                          I can certainly empathize with teachers who are at risk due to preexisting conditions or their children or close family members are at risk. It is their decision to keep their children home and learn remotely. If a teacher or a member of the teacher's household is at risk, can't he or she take a medical leave of absence as in the private sector?                                                                          I believe the School Committee has weighed all the risks to come up with the best solution. COVID 19 is fluid. The pandemic changes every day. I see that BID-Plymouth has a higher number of COVID patients this week than the larger communities. Of course the School Committee will reconsider according to the present circumstances.                                                                          For full disclosure, I have family members teaching in the Plymouth Schools.                                                                          Pat Adelmann has been a Plymouth resident since 1977 and is a mother of five Plymouth Public School graduates, a proud grandmother of 12, a former School Committee member and a former Town Meeting representative.                                                                                                                                                     Ed Angley                                                                          Nothing will satisfy everyone, particularly in these times when everyone is an expert, no one listens to each other and the "experts" cannot agree. My daughter is going to home school mainly because her husband has severe asthma and if he gets the virus he will not do well. I have a daughter-in- law who is an elementary school teacher. She is not an alarmist, but is concerned, as are many people, about how the whole issue is being handled - two days of virtual, two days of in-school, and she will have to be there every day.                                                                          I saw an article where in a footnote to a report the CDC said they questioned the efficacy of face masks. Another article said if we don't wear face masks the world is doomed.

Instead, NC State decided that there was no need to consider new ideas, and that following the CDC was sufficient. If anything happens, blame the students for partying. The UNC System knows best; NC State knows best.                                           In fairness, we don't know whether NC State's administrators were the real decision-makers, or merely implementing the UNC System's decisions. Let's think this through. If NC State's team called the shots, then we can sympathize that they had to make tough calls. At the same time, we can criticize their lack of caution in choosing to reopen the university during the pandemic. Some students feel that they haphazardly chose to reopen just for money. The university claims that it has been taking the pandemic very seriously, yet ignored various constructive suggestions, including high-capacity testing.                                          What if NC State's reopening team was merely implementing the UNC System's decisions? If so, did NC State's reopening team feel that the plans were reckless, yet went along? Why didn't they speak up? Where is their personal accountability?                                           And did they pretend that students won't attend parties? Or maybe this truly was about money, and they planned to blame students all along. Let's face it, they should have known better than to give students the opportunity to let this happen. For these reasons, Technician and other student papers have called for administrators to resign.                                           NC State could have led the pandemic response. They could have innovated. They could have made us proud. Instead, they followed the CDC's minimalist guidelines, and blamed students when things went wrong. Do we expect a major university to follow, or to lead?                                           _Dror Baron is an associate professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at NC State._

 Should Plymouth schools rethink hybrid?
 A group of parents and teachers is calling on school officials to rethink their hybrid school reopening plan, saying the plan to send students to classes part-time is not safe enough. The group demands that the School Department at least offer an alternative that allows students in all grade levels to learn from local teachers remotely. What do you think?
 Pat Adelmann
 I can certainly empathize with teachers who are at risk due to preexisting conditions or their children or close family members are at risk. It is their decision to keep their children home and learn remotely. If a teacher or a member of the teacher's household is at risk, can't he or she take a medical leave of absence as in the private sector?
 I believe the School Committee has weighed all the risks to come up with the best solution. COVID 19 is fluid. The pandemic changes every day. I see that BID-Plymouth has a higher number of COVID patients this week than the larger communities. Of course the School Committee will reconsider according to the present circumstances.
 For full disclosure, I have family members teaching in the Plymouth Schools.
 Pat Adelmann has been a Plymouth resident since 1977 and is a mother of five Plymouth Public School graduates, a proud grandmother of 12, a former School Committee member and a former Town Meeting representative.
 Ed Angley
 Nothing will satisfy everyone, particularly in these times when everyone is an expert, no one listens to each other and the "experts" cannot agree. My daughter is going to home school mainly because her husband has severe asthma and if he gets the virus he will not do well. I have a daughter-in- law who is an elementary school teacher. She is not an alarmist, but is concerned, as are many people, about how the whole issue is being handled - two days of virtual, two days of in-school, and she will have to be there every day.
 I saw an article where in a footnote to a report the CDC said they questioned the efficacy of face masks. Another article said if we don't wear face masks the world is doomed.

GORDON, Edward Mason Edward Mason Gordon died at home in Austin in the loving arms of his husband James David Bartsch Aug. 18, 2020. He was born July 25, 1964 in Redwood City, Calif. Eddie was a remarkable man who lived life to the fullest, who laughed loudly and often, and who loved family and friends with a deep faith in a better tomorrow. His love for the band Rush and for the natural world around him were only matched by his love for his family and friends. Eddie was affectionately known by family and friends as Itchy Brother, Little Eddie, Uncle Eddie, Uncle Jeddy, Mr. Ed, Sunshine, Sunflower, Tweetie and Baby. And anybody who met Eddie has an Eddie story. Eddie's memory of song lyrics was matched by very few, and his enthusiasm for the art of music rubbed off on those who were close to him. He attended 27 Rush concerts in his lifetime and the freedom of music helped soothe him through difficult times before his death. Rush once sang that "Life is like a garden that you need to nurture and protect" and Eddie paired that with an influential quote from Mr. Rogers that said "Be gentle, kind and true." Those two things combined made Eddie someone who espoused tolerance, respect and making people feel like they matter. He used his wittiness and love of laughter to draw people in and show them how much he valued them in his life. Aside from song lyrics, Eddie was also a huge fan of the natural world around him. Many childhood memories were formed in Northern California where he grew up, and in his adult years he and James experienced places like Lake Travis, the Grand Canyon, Monument Valley, Canyon de Chelly, Idaho, British Columbia and Nantucket while taking numerous road trips, with Eddie as navigator. Eddie worked in the San Jose, Calif. area before his sister Frances convinced him to move to Little Rock, Ark., where he eventually enrolled at the University of Arkansas and graduated magna cum laude in 1989 with a degree in business administration. He was a member of Beta Gamma Sigma, The Honor Society of Phi Kappa Phi and Epsilon Phi. With degree in hand, he moved to North Carolina, working for Dillard's and Belk, which led him to Paris, Texas. A trip to Austin captured Eddie's adoration and he patiently waited for the right opportunity to set roots in the city. That came in 1997, when he was recruited by Mervyn's. It was indeed the right move, for he was recruited to work for Bed, Bath & Beyond soon after, but most importantly, he met James eight months later - love at first sight. Eddie and James were blessed with 22 years together. They first married May 25, 2013 (the 15th anniversary of the day they met in 1998) in Nantucket and seized the opportunity to marry in their home city on July 4, 2015 - they wanted to be sure nobody could take that away! Eddie is survived by his husband, James, and his sisters Frances (Gordon) Bapst of Jacksonville, Fla., Elizabeth (Gordon) Filitor of Woodstock, Ga., and Kathy (Gordon) Nielsen of Greenville, S.C. His parents Byron Benjamin Gordon and Elizabeth Joy Gordon preceded him in death, as did his brothers Douglas Michael, Martin Gerard and Kevin Thomas. Extended family left to mourn and honor Eddie include many adoring nieces and nephews in California, Florida, Illinois, North & South Carolina and Texas. His Texas in-laws include Mary Alexander, Helen Neel, Herbert (Shirley) Bartsch, Jeannette (Ricky) Taylor, Ronnie (Charlotte) Bartsch, Jerry Bartsch & Kristene (Victor) Garcia. Edward Mason Gordon met every challenge he faced head on with dignity, strength and perseverance. He never complained about his circumstances. He made so many lives better for being here and being who he was. He loved mentoring, he encouraged others and he always accomplished his goals. He was the little engine that could. Reading was another of Eddie's loves, and throughout his life his sister Frances and James would read "Miss Suzy" to him. The story ends with Miss Suzy being at home, with everything in order and her looking up at a million stars, being at total peace - as Eddie is now. Eddie's family wants to express heartfelt gratitude toward all the many health professionals who helped Eddie over the last eight years. Drs. Brian Vaillant, David Wright, Daniel Peterson, Paiman Ghafoori and Kate Tindall were amazing. The family also acknowledges the staff at Dell Seton Hospital in Austin, Seton Brain & Spine, Austin Cancer Center, Texas Oncology, Austin Radiological, Cyberknife, Walgreen's Mesa, Hanger Clinic, Seton, St. David's, St. David's Rehabilitation Hospital, Rhonda Hearns and Hospice Austin. Above that, so many wonderful, compassionate and caring friends provided invaluable and selfless help, visiting often to brighten the day or take Eddie to appointments. Drea, Cindy, Candy, Paula, Siegi, Chris, Rama, Michelle, Trish, Esther, Greta and more - Thank you for helping care for our Little Eddie! Also special thanks go to Kenny and the Goddard family for their hospitality in Nantucket. Memorial service arrangements are pending. You can contact alivingtribute.org and plant a tree in his honor, a touching tribute for a man who took so much joy from nature.

The app store is a joke, they have nothing in there that people actually use. All the fanfare about an app that allows you to conference call in the car...really? Despite the fact that LR have put a ton of money into a new research facility in Oregon, it couldn't come soon enough. justDrive is a better alternative to using your phone, but it saps data and is clunky. It tires to filter all your functions into one easy application, but fails in poor quality graphics, and bad overlay. It also requires continuous cell coverage, which can be problematic when heading into the tundra. Sadly its inhouse sat nav is just not up to snuff, and has been around for years, but its stubbornly holding on. Last gripe on the tech front, is the screen size, camera quality and safety features.

Why my car doesn't have a hotspot connection is beyond me. Most do these days, and its not exactly cutting edge technology. As for the sound system, I also opted for the base, which is piss poor. You have to turn the sound up really high to actually hear it, and there is no bass to speak of. I had the base sound system in the Audi and it was amazing.

In contrast, Lampard has shown a commitment to building more long-term at Stamford Bridge with faith in younger players right at the top level. Some of that has been enforced through a transfer ban last summer but it stands to reason that investing time in young talents will later pay off in some shape or form.
 While Mason Mount, Reece James and others to be afforded their first shot at Premier League football will spring to mind, investment further down the club’s structure demonstrates foresight in the transfer window.
 The recent arrival of Xavier Mbuyamba from Barcelona proves the case in point amid a backdrop of heavier spending on the first-team squad.
 At the age of 18, the Dutch defender is at a crossroads in his development where he needs to find a genuine pathway to first-team football. And, given the plethora of young talent at Barcelona, leaving the Camp Nou stands as an admirable decision.

You might be astounded by this idea. Test most of the population multiple times a week? Isn't testing very expensive? Yes and no.                                          On the one hand, the U.S. federal government compensates labs handsomely for COVID-19 tests; $100 per test is typical. However, labs' costs are lower. I've been working on high-capacity testing since February. Results have been presented to multiple audiences, and I've interviewed for Nature, IEEE Spectrum and Technician in a piece written by Kathryn Ellis. When testing symptomatic people, typically 10-20% are infected, and we can test 500 people using 200-300 tests. For asymptomatics being screened regularly, few are infected, our gains improve, and we can test 10,000 people using a few hundred tests.                                          We told NC State administrators about this in April. They could have tested the entire university population twice a week for under $100,000. Our administrators and coaches are well paid; this was a question of prioritization and decisiveness.

COOSE, Margaret Catherine McCallum Margaret Catherine McCallum Coose passed away peacefully at her home on Sunday, August 16, 2020. Margo was born in Dundee, Scotland on September 19, 1940. While in school she learned traditional Scottish dancing, sewing, cooking, crochet, and knitting along with her curriculum. Her talents were perfected during cold Scottish winters. She was an excellent baker and cook. Her pies, homemade soups, and homemade fries were some favorites everyone looked forward to. Margo ran her own beauty shop "The Hairtakers" on South Lamar & later on South First Street for many years. She brought beauty and joy to people and built a successful business. When she felt it was time for a change she opened a home daycare. She loved teaching, caring for, and watching these children grow over the years. They became part of her extended family. She enjoyed taking classes and was surrounded by the very supportive Austin home daycare community. There she made many friends & found a place to flourish. Margo "Mum" was a hard worker and had a huge heart. She always had words of wisdom for her family and friends. She was never too busy to help with a problem when we needed and lend an ear to listen. A cup of tea (or coffee) & a chat solved much. Her children would agree she was a sweet mama that loved to spoil her children. All the while keeping them in line. She had so many gifts to give, a tune to sing, and a sense of humor to share. Her smile is one to remember. She will be missed greatly. Margo's parents were Alexander Weir McCallum and Elizabeth (Young) McArthur. She was their last surviving child out of 13 siblings. Margo is survived by her five daughters and their families. Her eldest daughters from her marriage to Thomas Birks are Jacqueline Acosta and Vivien West (Husband Stan West). Her daughters from her marriage to James P. Coose are Rachel Cummins (Husband Kevin Cummins), Nicole Coose, and Melissa Coose (Partner Elias Urioste). Her grandchildren are Brandon Acosta, Dallas and Dakoda Flores, Steven Windham, Krystle Gutierrez, Venancio Nunez, Georgia and Adele Cummins, Andoni and Lillian Urioste. Great-grandchildren: Katelyn, and Kristopher Gutierrez, Presley and Linkin Windham, and many nieces and nephews in Scotland. She also extended her love to our other siblings Tula Robbins and Peter Coose. Tula's children Zoe and Athena Shaw, and her grandchild Eden Zamarron. Peter's Children Jace and Loren Coose. Margo was laid to rest at Onion Creek Memorial Park on August 20, 2020. An online Memorial will be held September 19, 2020 on what would have been her 80th Birthday.

Selena Gomez estrenó este viernes su anticipada canción “Ice Cream” junto a las surcoreanas BLACKPINK, uno de los grupos de referencia del género K-pop al que cada vez más artistas estadounidenses prestan atención. Para promocionar el tema, escrito por Ariana Grande y Victoria Monét, las intérpretes han lanzado al mercado un sabor de helado exclusivo que ha servido de aperitivo de un vídeo musical en el que Gomez y las integrantes de BLACKPINK bailan en diferentes heladerías con una estética dominada por tonos pastel. Esta es la segunda colaboración de la banda de K-pop con una estrella estadounidense, pues en mayo las surcoreanas publicaron “Sour Candy” con Lady Gaga, tema que forma parte del disco “Chromatica”. Antes, en 2018, BLACKPINK publicó “Kiss and Make Up” con la británica Dua Lipa, una de las primeras artistas anglosajonas que se sumó a la ola de popularidad que la industria musical de Corea del Sur está experimentando. De hecho, la prensa musical aguarda el lanzamiento del próximo disco del grupo este otoño, después de convertirse en la primera banda femenina de K-pop que actuó en el festival de Coachella. Por su parte, Gómez ha utilizado la nueva canción en los anuncios de su programa de cocina, titulado “Selena + CHEF” y grabado durante el confinamiento por el coronavirus. El formato se estrenó el 13 de agosto en la plataforma HBO Max y consta de 10 episodios en los que Gomez aprende a cocinar recetas de diferentes países de la mano de un cocinero invitado. Asimismo, la cantante y actriz formará junto a los veteranos Steve Martin y Martin Short el triángulo protagonista de “Only Murders in the Building”, una nueva serie de comedia que está preparando Hulu. En los últimos años, Gomez se ha mostrado cada vez más interesada en explorar la producción televisiva, ya fuera con la serie “13 Reasons Why” (2017-2020) o con el documental “Living Undocumented” (2019), ambos para Netflix.

Gravestones scribbled with identity numbers are all that remain of dozens of migrants aboard a boat that sank in a Turkish lake as they struggled to make it to Europe.
 Lake Van, a vast body of water nearly seven times the size of Lake Geneva, has become a death trap for Afghan, Pakistani and other migrants seeking security and work.
 The sinking of two boats in June and December, claiming 68 lives in all, underscores the perils of a route used to circumnavigate checkpoints set up across the rugged eastern terrain of Turkey, not far from Iran.
 Hiding on the boat with 60 others that sank on June 27 was Mehdi Mosin, then just 17.
 He had left his hometown of Kharian in northeast Pakistan "for a better future", his sobbing father said.
 "My wife barely gets out of bed anymore," Shafqat Mosin said by phone from Pakistan.
 "At night, she cries out, asking me to open the door, thinking that our son will come home."
 He tried to stop his son from going, but eventually relented.
 "If I had known it was that dangerous, I would never have let him go," Mosin said.
 Turkey, which offered fast-track access to Europe during the 2015 migrant crisis, has become an increasingly difficult country to cross.
 The first move to cut the flow of migrants came after Ankara and Brussels signed a migration deal in 2016, but the measures were stepped up from 2018 against the backdrop of an economic crisis in Turkey.
 The country is already home to around four million migrants, 3.6 million of them from war-torn Syria.
 \- 'I started to pray' -
 Before reaching the lake, the migrants must often cross perilous border mountains. Every year, villagers discover frozen bodies after the snow melts.
 In Van Province, which borders Iran, two cemeteries were set up to bury migrants who could not be identified.
 In one, there were freshly dug graves, awaiting the next victims.
 When the weather is pleasant, the lake appears harmless.
 Families have picnics on wooden tables while watching others wobble on their paddleboards, as a local municipality official cleans the promenade.
 But its unpredictable waters leave little chance for small, flimsy boats.
 Muhammad, a 25-year-old Pakistani man who made it to Istanbul, crossed the lake in early March at night in an overloaded and dilapidated boat.
 "There were around 50 people on board and only five life jackets," he told AFP. "There were women and children. I kept wondering what we would do if the boat sank."
 When the waves started to rock his boat, "I started to pray," he said. "I saw from the looks around me that everyone was afraid."
 Three months earlier another boat carrying migrants had capsized, leaving seven dead.
 After the fatal June accident, security services detained several smugglers. Since then, migrants and residents say that crossings by lake, which had been staged almost daily before then, have fallen sharply.
 \- 'I have no choice' -
 Migrants who cannot find a boat are forced to walk for days under the blazing sun, cutting across fields to get around checkpoints.
 At a bus station in Tatvan, a town 140 kilometres (85 miles) west of Van, around 20 exhausted men sit on the ground, their damaged shoes lined up in front of them.
 Despite the dangers, none of them are ready to give up.
 "My father is sick. I must find work in Europe," said Mahmoud, a Kurd from Iraq. "It's dangerous, I'm hungry, I'm cold, but I have no choice."
 Mahmut Kacan, a lawyer specialising in migration issues at the Van Bar Association, said the number of migrants dying in Van jumped after the closure of the local branch of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in 2018.
 Asylum applications are now instead being handled by the Turkish authorities.
 The lengthy, arduous procedures "create a climate of uncertainty" for migrants, who "take more risks" as a result, he told AFP.
 Faced with the many dangers, some have opted not to take the risk.
 "We had agreed with the smuggler that he would take us to Greece," said Abbas Khasimi, an Afghan who came to Van last year.
 "But I decided to stay (in Van) for the life of my wife and my child, because the journey was too dangerous," he told AFP.
 They have applied for refugee status in order to travel to Europe, and now cling on to this slim chance.
 "Our daughter must have a future," Khasimi said. "For my wife and me, it's too late. But it must not be too late for her."

We all know sunflowers (helianthus), as they are one of the most recognizable flowers. Their brilliant color and rustic charm endear them to young and old, gardener and painter. They grace gardens and fields, blooming in the latter part of the summer. Those tall stalks not only beg our attention, but they also attract birds, butterflies and bees. I will always remember driving on a back road near Baltimore and coming across a breath-taking sight of sunflowers. The countryside was glowing with these bright, canary-yellow flowers that embellished the road for a long way. I have read and seen pictures of the fields in Italy, where you see sunflowers for miles, and I felt I was experiencing that sight.                                          Each August, I ask my son Will to let me know when his field of sunflowers is blooming. I like to go and just enjoy the site and to pick some for the house. I am always curious which way they will be facing when I visit his field. It is fun to watch the young flowers turn eastward at dawn to greet the sun. Then, as the sun starts to rise above the horizon, these charming flowers begin their romance with the sun as they follow it across the sky. By sunset time, they will be facing west to watch the sun disappear into the horizon. Then by morning, they are all facing east again and are ready to start again.                                           Sunflowers come in many different colors and sizes. There are the tall ones that come to mind when someone mentions sunflowers. There are also medium-sized ones that grow to about 4 or 5 feet. Today, you can even get dwarf varieties that are quite charming, only growing to about 2 feet tall. Their colors have a wide range of hues too, going from brilliant yellow to rust, brown and amber and shades in-between.                                           There are also sunflowers that are continuous bloomers. This spring, I was visiting nurseries as I usually do, mask on and keeping a distance of course; I was introduced to some new plants as I roamed the isles. I always want to see what the different garden centers bring in to sell and to see which plants are the most popular.                                           On my ventures to nurseries, two new annual sunflowers caught my attention. The first one was named SunBelievable or Brown Eyed Girl Helianthus. It has the happy face of a sunflower with multi-branching and dwarf in size. SunBelievable has golden yellow petals that become reddish-brown towards the base and they blend well into a dark brown center. This plant does not produce seed, putting all of its energy into making a constant crop of flowers. They are cheerful looking in the container and I was told that they bloomed all summer long. I was keen to give this plant a try.                                           When I purchased them, they had a few blooms and I assumed as the plant grew, I would see more. They have looked nice all summer, but now they are about to explode with even more blooms. I was content with the number I was getting, but in a week, I will have a bush with even more flowers covering the plant at a time when other flowers are starting to fade.                                           Shortly after finding SunBelievable, I was visiting another nursery and I spotted another dwarf sunflower that was bright, clear yellow. It was named Sunfinity. This plant was about 18 inches tall with yellow, daisy-looking flowers that were quite cheerful looking. This plant was developed to give the home gardener colorful, long-lasting sunflower looking blooms that are smaller and bloom over several months. Sunfinity was created to have many stems with a multitude of blooms to flower all season long. This was a unique and different way to look at sunflowers.                                           They do not have the large heads of what I think of as traditional sunflowers - the bloom is only about 3 inches wide. However, the number of blooms and the length of time they have flowers make up for the size.                                          There are companies that specialize in all the new and exciting sunflowers and catalogs to tempt you. You can save your seeds, but remember that cross-pollination could have occurred and you might not get a flower that is exactly like the one you collected seed from. It is best to purchase new fresh seeds each year if you want a particular looking sunflower. Sunflowers are a joy to grow, and I hope I always have some to greet the morning and to brighten the countryside.

Large numbers of sunseekers flocked to Bondi and Coogee beaches as temperatures climbed towards a forecast 24C, but authorities say their usual patrols of the area found people are generally doing the right thing and so far no fines have been issued. At Little Bay, however, there have been concerns, so officers have been deployed to monitor, a police spokesman said on Sunday. A spokeswoman for Waverley Council said 3000-4000 people had come to Bondi and while it appeared crowded from certain angles, drone footage showed people were behaving well. “We’re hoping this continues,” she said. The council’s lifeguard manager Matt du Plessis said people had been instructed to keep one beach towel’s distance from each other and all were complying, which was in contrast to March when the pandemic took hold. “It’s actually been really great - everybody’s abiding health orders,” Mr du Plessis said. “It’s been a long winter ... I think now everyone understands. “We want to keep our beaches open. “I think it will be a great summer. It’s up to individuals to do the right thing.” There was also a steady stream of well-behaved visitors to Bondi and Bronte on Saturday, with numbers surging around 2pm when the temperature reached 22C. Randwick Council, which covers Coogee, has reminded beachgoers “social distancing still matters”. “If you’re planning a dip at one of our beaches this weekend don’t forget to keep space between yourself and others, avoid large groups, use hand sanitiser and bring a mask if you want,” the council tweeted. “Let’s continue to be #covidsafe.”

GORDON, Edward Mason Edward Mason Gordon died at home in Austin in the loving arms of his husband James David Bartsch Aug. 18, 2020. He was born July 25, 1964 in Redwood City, Calif. Eddie was a remarkable man who lived life to the fullest, who laughed loudly and often, and who loved family and friends with a deep faith in a better tomorrow. His love for the band Rush and for the natural world around him were only matched by his love for his family and friends. Eddie was affectionately known by family and friends as Itchy Brother, Little Eddie, Uncle Eddie, Uncle Jeddy, Mr. Ed, Sunshine, Sunflower, Tweetie and Baby. And anybody who met Eddie has an Eddie story. Eddie's memory of song lyrics was matched by very few, and his enthusiasm for the art of music rubbed off on those who were close to him. He attended 27 Rush concerts in his lifetime and the freedom of music helped soothe him through difficult times before his death. Rush once sang that "Life is like a garden that you need to nurture and protect" and Eddie paired that with an influential quote from Mr. Rogers that said "Be gentle, kind and true." Those two things combined made Eddie someone who espoused tolerance, respect and making people feel like they matter. He used his wittiness and love of laughter to draw people in and show them how much he valued them in his life. Aside from song lyrics, Eddie was also a huge fan of the natural world around him. Many childhood memories were formed in Northern California where he grew up, and in his adult years he and James experienced places like Lake Travis, the Grand Canyon, Monument Valley, Canyon de Chelly, Idaho, British Columbia and Nantucket while taking numerous road trips, with Eddie as navigator. Eddie worked in the San Jose, Calif. area before his sister Frances convinced him to move to Little Rock, Ark., where he eventually enrolled at the University of Arkansas and graduated magna cum laude in 1989 with a degree in business administration. He was a member of Beta Gamma Sigma, The Honor Society of Phi Kappa Phi and Epsilon Phi. With degree in hand, he moved to North Carolina, working for Dillard's and Belk, which led him to Paris, Texas. A trip to Austin captured Eddie's adoration and he patiently waited for the right opportunity to set roots in the city. That came in 1997, when he was recruited by Mervyn's. It was indeed the right move, for he was recruited to work for Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond soon after, but most importantly, he met James eight months later - love at first sight. Eddie and James were blessed with 22 years together. They first married May 25, 2013 (the 15th anniversary of the day they met in 1998) in Nantucket and seized the opportunity to marry in their home city on July 4, 2015 - they wanted to be sure nobody could take that away! Eddie is survived by his husband, James, and his sisters Frances (Gordon) Bapst of Jacksonville, Fla., Elizabeth (Gordon) Filitor of Woodstock, Ga., and Kathy (Gordon) Nielsen of Greenville, S.C. His parents Byron Benjamin Gordon and Elizabeth Joy Gordon preceded him in death, as did his brothers Douglas Michael, Martin Gerard and Kevin Thomas. Extended family left to mourn and honor Eddie include many adoring nieces and nephews in California, Florida, Illinois, North &amp; South Carolina and Texas. His Texas in-laws include Mary Alexander, Helen Neel, Herbert (Shirley) Bartsch, Jeannette (Ricky) Taylor, Ronnie (Charlotte) Bartsch, Jerry Bartsch &amp; Kristene (Victor) Garcia. Edward Mason Gordon met every challenge he faced head on with dignity, strength and perseverance. He never complained about his circumstances. He made so many lives better for being here and being who he was. He loved mentoring, he encouraged others and he always accomplished his goals. He was the little engine that could. Reading was another of Eddie's loves, and throughout his life his sister Frances and James would read "Miss Suzy" to him. The story ends with Miss Suzy being at home, with everything in order and her looking up at a million stars, being at total peace - as Eddie is now. Eddie's family wants to express heartfelt gratitude toward all the many health professionals who helped Eddie over the last eight years. Drs. Brian Vaillant, David Wright, Daniel Peterson, Paiman Ghafoori and Kate Tindall were amazing. The family also acknowledges the staff at Dell Seton Hospital in Austin, Seton Brain &amp; Spine, Austin Cancer Center, Texas Oncology, Austin Radiological, Cyberknife, Walgreen's Mesa, Hanger Clinic, Seton, St. David's, St. David's Rehabilitation Hospital, Rhonda Hearns and Hospice Austin. Above that, so many wonderful, compassionate and caring friends provided invaluable and selfless help, visiting often to brighten the day or take Eddie to appointments. Drea, Cindy, Candy, Paula, Siegi, Chris, Rama, Michelle, Trish, Esther, Greta and more - Thank you for helping care for our Little Eddie! Also special thanks go to Kenny and the Goddard family for their hospitality in Nantucket. Memorial service arrangements are pending. You can contact alivingtribute.org and plant a tree in his honor, a touching tribute for a man who took so much joy from nature.

The navigation system is really clunky, this is hands down my biggest question of "what were they thinking?". If you are entering an address  you need to start from the bottom of the menu. The keyboard is set-up in alphabetical order which is so counterintuative, who types like that??-NO ONE, LAND ROVER. And who in the world at LR said "yeah, this is great, let's go with it.". As you are typing in letters the keyboard/screen goes dark for a second or so before the next avilable group of letters is availble, which is so slow!! The last time I used it my daughter and I were instructed to get off at an exit, we were now facing a traffic circle. The Nav system was silent for awhile while we drove in circles, then it instructed us to turn right on a street number that was not even on that traffic circle, it was just silent. We were so frustrated that we pulled into a gas staion, turned off the car, restarted it and reentered our destination. In the mean time we pulled out our Iphones to to direct us and it sent us on a totally different and better direction than the LR nav system.

It was a rough week here in the middle of a challenging year.
 Part of my job these days is what I call “watching the horizon,” which means looking at Twitter many times an hour to keep pace with bad news that seems to come out of nowhere faster than a West Texas squall. Unfortunately, I have to write about it if a COVID-19 case threatens to shut down fall sports practice and games for two weeks in any of about four dozen local schools. That didn’t pop up much last week.
 But what did twist my stomach more than a few times were complex, violent scenes and ugly racial arguments played out on social media.
 I’m tempted to write that it was nice to get away from social media and just cover a high school football game on Friday night. That would be misleading, however, because social media is now very much a component of covering high school football. I tweeted updates of the Mart-Teague game and put personal photos from the night on Instagram and Facebook.

Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp praised Minamino's performance and called the 25-year-old's maiden strike an important step in his career with the club.                                                          "It was big for him and big for us because it was the only thing he lacked since he is with us," Klopp said during a press conference. "He didn't score a goal (before), but had situations and was close in plenty of moments."                                                          "The shape he is in is obviously good, I think everybody could see when he came on. Then, the goal is more or less the logical step after performing on the level he performs now, especially in the pre-season."                                                          Klopp said he expects Minamino to "be a real player" for Liverpool now that he has had time to adjust to the league and his new life in England, made particularly challenging by the coronavirus pandemic.                                                          "He can have an impact, that's why we signed him," he said. "It was not only the goal today. He is in between, he is really good in small spaces, his first touch is exceptional, then his decision-making between the lines is really quick."                                                          "He came in in the most difficult period of all our lives, I would say, and had to adapt to different things, being alone in England in the lockdown and all that stuff… But he dealt really well with it because he's a super professional. So I'm really pleased for him that he could score the goal today and that's another big step for him."                                                          Minamino was on target in the shootout but Rhian Brewster struck the crossbar as Liverpool lost the Community Shield on penalties for the second straight year. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang put Arsenal ahead in the first half.

What started with heartbreak ended with absolute elation. That was the journey this week's 50-for-50 profile, the 1986 Plymouth-Carver boys soccer team, took while on its way to the Division 1 state championship.
 "We had a great team in 1985," said John Tocci, a tri-captain on '86 title team alongside Archie Harlow and Doug Coggins. "We beat a really good Needham team in the South finals and then went up against Lexington in the next round and were absolutely crushed, 7-1.
 "We got our butts kicked that game, but it also lit a fire inside all of us that fueled what we did the next year. It was a defining moment for all of us and as soon as we got off the bus after the Lexington loss we all had the same attitude that this was not to happen to us again in '86\. That loss locked us in. We had 80-90 guys working out in the summer before we won the state title that were determined to bring that team to the next level."
 The passion was there at the start of the new season, but the results were not. P-C started out slow with a record of 1-2-1 before winning 19 of their next 20 games on their road to the program's one and only state championship.
 "It was an ominous start to the season," Head Coach Emerson Coleman admitted. "We were all disappointed in the way we got out of the gate because we knew we were a better soccer team than what we had shown. (The players and coaches) all had to look inside themselves and find what we needed to be the kind of soccer team that we all thought we could be."
 That kind of introspection seemed to flip a switch in the Blue Eagles and they were determined not to be stopped until the Div. 1 championship trophy was in their hands. They soared to a league title in the incredibly competitive Old Colony League and began the playoffs with a win over Brookline before getting the better of familiar foes Needham, Marshfield and then Bridgewater-Raynham to win the South sectional championship.
 Wakefield would fall in the Eastern Mass. finals, putting Plymouth-Carver exactly where they wanted to be all along in the state title game opposite Wachusett Regional. Not surprisingly, the victory 3-2 didn't come easily for P-C. The issue wasn't decided until Jeff Schultz scored in the opening minute of the second overtime period giving the victory to the Blue Eagles.
 "What I remember about that season is what a great group of players and people we had on the team," said Schultz, who went on to be a captain at Boston University. "'We had a really talented group of players and there were leaders up and down the roster. Everyone knew what their role was and everyone played those roles very, very well."
 Archie Harlow got the scoring started for P-C in the state title game when he converted a penalty kick. Wachusett answered back twice and held a 2-1 lead for a good portion of the game until midfielder Doug Coutts scored with five minutes left in regulation to tie things up before Schultz ended the long journey to a state championship with his OT winner.
 Peter Kasarjian was on the bench alongside Coleman for the title run along with freshman coach Larry Sheely and junior varsity coach Russ Govoni.
 "The quality of people and soccer players that were part of the team that year was off the charts," Kasarjian said. "There may have been three captains on the team but there were leaders all over the roster and there were also some terrific soccer players on that team."
 On their way to the state title the Blue Eagles scored lots of goals (123) and let up precious few of them (19). According to Coleman the eight seniors on the '86 team finished with an impressive varsity record of 68-10-7.
 Jim Prouty, Harlow, Jason Malone, Andy Moreland and David Whitaker were up on the attack with Schultz, Coutts and Tocci holding down the midfield. P-C was very fast and athletic on the back line as Mike Barton, Coggins, David McStowe and Chris Nardone tried to keep things safe and sound in front of goalkeeper Doug Maccaferri.
 According to Coleman this group always took it as a personal attack if their team was not in possession of the soccer ball.
 "I used to tell them 'we are nothing until we have the ball' and they really took that to heart," said Coleman, who would go on to coach the Duxbury High girls soccer program to a state title in 2008. "If we lost possession of the soccer ball all 11 players on the field were committed to getting it right back. We had a very strong defense that season and a big reason we did so well was there was a total commitment given by everyone to the team."
 Tocci, the current head coach of the Plymouth North boys soccer team, said the '86 team was a group of "misfit toys that worked perfectly together."
 "We had talent on the field and off the bench and the key part that made this all happen was everyone in the program was on the same page. Everyone was willing to play their role to help us succeed as a team," Tocci said.
 "You'd be hard pressed to find a team with more quality soccer players and quality people," said Coleman, pointing out that nine players from the 1986 team would move on to be a captain on their college soccer team. "You can't just be a pretty good team to win a state title. You have to have that something special. The '86 team had that something special. They weren't playing for themselves, they were playing for each other."
 Tocci said the familiarity the teammates developed with each stemmed from their days playing Plymouth Youth Soccer together. It was an important building block to the success they'd have at the high school. Tocci's father, Richie, is one of the original founding fathers of Plymouth Youth Soccer and was president of the league for many years.
 "Plymouth Youth Soccer was huge when I was growing up. No matter what sport you played, it seemed like everyone was part of the league back then and we all grew up playing with and against each other in the town league," Tocci explained. "By the time we got to high school we already knew each other pretty well and what everyone's strengths were."
 Regular season games against talented Old Colony League foes like B-R, Marshfield, Silver Lake and Weymouth got P-C more than prepared for what they'd see in the playoffs each year, Coleman said. "I think the OCL was up there with the toughest leagues in the state. Every game was a battle and I knew that after playing our league schedule that we'd be ready for anything we'd see in the tournament."
 "The talent in the OCL was incredible. It was really an honor to make the OCL All-Star team," Tocci said, who did so twice. "Everywhere you looked there was a great player and all of the teams were good. We'd go so hard against one another for 80 minutes but there was also so much respect between all of the teams at the end of those games."
 Success was spreading all over the Plymouth sports program's in the 1980's. Football (two) and boys cross-country also won state titles and the girls soccer and basketball teams were all putting together some incredible seasons. The excitement from one sports season bled right into the next as each team tried to top the success of the one before them.
 "The fan support in school and at the games was incredible. You really had to be there to experience it," Tocci said. "We used to play a lot of boys/girls doubleheaders under the lights at the old Romano Stadium and the atmosphere was awesome when we'd walk down the hill to get to the field.
 "We'd all be bummed out when we saw we'd have a day home game on the schedule because the night games were always packed with our fans and the atmosphere was electric."
 Each week during 2020, the 50-for-50 project will profile a Plymouth person or state championship team that positively impacted the town in the last 50 years. To nominate someone, email Sports Editor David Wolcott Jr. at dwolcott@wickedlocal.com with information on the nominee.

He listened.                                          "I took the time to understand it is different growing up Black in America,” Darnold said Saturday. "And I now understand that better.”                                          Darnold recalled how his parents always harped on him returning home before dark in Southern California so he didn't get lost. He heard another not-so-sugarcoated side of that same curfew rule from his teammates.                                          "They were told, 'Hey, make sure you’re home before dark or else something bad can happen,'” Darnold said. "That's a different conversation than what my parents had with me.”                                          The Jets were one of nine NFL teams that canceled practice Thursday in wake of the police shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man, in Wisconsin last Sunday. Instead of taking the field, the entire team spent more than four hours talking about racial injustice and social issues.                                          The conversations — which included team president and CEO Christopher Johnson, general manager Joe Douglas and coach Adam Gase — were led by players detailing their experiences with racism, inequality and police brutality. They continued their discussions Friday, an off day, to begin devising plans to effect change among each other and in the community.                                          "One of the guys in the room was like, ’In order for us to help, we have to realize that this is a snowball and not an avalanche,’” said offensive lineman Jonotthan Harrison, who is Black. "We can't just jump off the deep end and be like, attack this and do this and do this. No, we have to be very methodical and we have to approach it the right way, the safest way.”                                          Many teams around the league have had similar conversations — with topics ranging from equal rights to making sure players are registered to vote — in the days since Blake, 29, was left paralyzed after being shot in the back by a police officer.                                          The Seattle Seahawks canceled their scheduled practice Saturday after a lengthy team meeting. Coach Pete Carroll gave an impassioned speech while addressing reporters later in the day.                                          "Our players are screaming at us: ‘Can you feel me? Can you see me? Can you hear me?’” said Carroll, who is white. "They just want to be respected. They just want to be accepted. Just like all of our white children and families and want to be. It’s no different because we’re all the same.                                          "And there’s a lot of people that don’t see it that way, but there’s a lot of people that do.”                                          Carroll said all of the Seahawks players would register to vote by the end of the day, and the team later tweeted it had accomplished that goal.                                          Blake's shooting was captured on cellphone video and ignited new protests in the U.S. three months after the death of George Floyd under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer touched off a nationwide reckoning over racial injustice — and discussions among NFL players and staffs about equality.                                          "A lot of our players, a lot of our Black players, are hurting from the standpoint of this is close to home for many of them,” said Philadelphia Eagles coach Doug Pederson, who is white. "So for me, it’s about understanding, it’s about learning, it’s about gaining knowledge, and then being able to support our guys.”                                          Bengals players, coaches, ownership and staff marched together in Cincinnati from Paul Brown Stadium to the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center on Saturday.                                          "Together, as a unified front, we must identify, address and ultimately end those practices and policies that would deny liberty and justice to all, regardless of race, religion, or creed,” the Bengals said in a statement. "It is time for us all to take a stand! It is each of our responsibility to effect change in our communities, not only for us but for those yet to come.                                          "We cannot turn a blind eye to the racism still experienced in this country.”                                          On Friday night at Heinz Field in Pittsburgh, Steelers coach Mike Tomlin — flanked by team president Art Rooney II and general manager Kevin Colbert — briefly spoke on social unrest and prejudice while players locked arms behind him.                                          Tomlin, one of three Black NFL head coaches, is the third-longest tenured coach in the league. Players and staff followed Tomlin’s speech by kneeling in prayer around the 50-yard line.                                          "We decided to come together, lock arms and make a stand to show compassion,” linebacker Vince Williams said Saturday. "Even though we’re professional athletes, we’re still sympathetic to everything going on.”                                          Darnold said he and his Jets teammates have not talked about sitting out any games as a form of protest, something that has happened the past several days in other sports such as the NBA, WNBA, NHL, MLS and Major League Baseball.                                          "We have to continue playing because, quite frankly, this is the reason we have a platform, is because we play football and we are in the NFL,” Darnold said. "And that was a huge point to all the guys was, we have to continue playing, we have to continue to push our message across and get our points across to everyone because if we stop playing then that platform can be taken away from us.”                                          Green Bay Packers center Corey Linsley, who is white, said it was eye-opening to listen to some of his teammates' experiences — particularly offensive lineman Billy Turner and linebacker Christian Kirksey, both of whom are Black.                                          "To hear their stories and especially know the place that they’re coming from, it’s impactful, man,” Linsley said Saturday. "It hits you different, for sure. It’s made an impact on me.                                          "It’s made an impact on a number of guys in this locker room in the way that we view the world, the way that we view our criminal justice system, the way that we view society in general.”

Every par at Olympia Fields is hard work, and Johnson played the final 13 holes Saturday with nothing worse than that. It's what carried him to a 1-under 69 and a share of the lead with Hideki Matsuyama, leaving them as the only players under par going into the final round.                                                                          "I feel like it's fairly similar, just obviously these conditions and the greens are a lot more difficult," he said. "This is pretty much a major championship venue, and the conditions, the way it's set up, it's playing just like a major.”                                                                          Matsuyama, who had a three-shot lead early when he holed a bunker shot for eagle at the start and stuffed a wedge in tight for birdie on No. 4, fell back with a string of bogeys and held it together for a 69.                                                                          "Great start and then just had to hang on,” Matsuyama said. "Just tried to do what I could to stay in, and I was happy with how it went.”                                                                          Johnson and Maruyama were at 1-under 209. Everyone else was over par going into the final round.                                                                          Sunday is one last chance for some players to be among the top 30 who advance to the FedEx Cup finale, and one last round for others — like Tiger Woods — to prepare for the U.S. Open on a course that plays every bit as tough.                                                                          Patrick Cantlay only hit five fairways and didn't make a birdie as he tumbled out of a tie for the lead with a round with a 75 that left him five shots behind and might cost him a spot in the Tour Championship.                                                                          Rory McIlroy had to play left-handed to escape the base of a tree in starting the back nine with a bogey, and he finished with a shot he thought was going to be long, came up 70 feet short and led to a three-putt bogey for a 73. He still was only three shots back assuming he plays.                                                                          McIlroy said after the round his wife is expecting their first child, news they had shared with family and friends but was revealed during the NBC broadcast. He said his caddie and best friend, Harry Diamond, has kept a phone in his pocket to not miss a call. And if it's time, he said, "I'm out of here.”                                                                          Jon Rahm matched the low round of the day at 66 that could have easily been one shot better if not for a blunder that even he couldn't believe. He forgot to set a marker down on the green before picking up his golf ball on No. 5, freezing in his tracks when he realized what happened.                                                                          "I was thinking of somebody else or something else… and yeah, I just picked up the ball without marking it, simple as that,” Rahm said after a round that left him only three behind. "I can't really give you an explanation. It's one of those things that happen in golf. Never thought it would in my professional career, but here we are.”                                                                          A week ago at The Northern Trust on a rain-softened course with little wind, Johnson was at 22-under par through three rounds and had a five-shot lead. That felt easy. This does not.                                                                          Joaquin Niemann had a 68 and was part of the group at 1-over 211 that included Adam Scott (70) and Mackenzie Hughes (69). Another shot back were the likes of Rahm, Bubba Watson, Brendon Todd and Kevin Kisner, who had 15 pars, two birdie and bogey for his round of 70.                                                                          Rounds like that go a long way at Olympia Fields, the former U.S. Open course playing like one with its thick rough and rock-hard greens and enough wind to make the fairways look tighter than they are.                                                                          "I’ve played good and bad this week, and I’ve had basically the same score every day,” Scott said, whose superb bunker play kept him close. "I saw today, though, that if I hit it well, there’s a chance to make a few putts. One of this leading group will shoot 4 under tomorrow, 4 or 5 under I’m sure.”                                                                          Woods, meanwhile, had a reasonable start to his round and wasn't losing much ground until he lost a tee shot into the water right of the 17th fairway and then smothered a fairway metal to the left. He walked across a cart path smacking the club off the concrete and twice looked like he wanted to break it. He missed a short putt for triple bogey and shot 72.                                                                          Woods has yet to break par this week. One more round like that and it will be the first time in 10 years — the Bridgestone Invitational at Firestone — that he had all four rounds over par. He needed something around fourth to advance to the Tour Championship for the first time since 2018.                                                                          Matsuyama is trying to end three years without a victory. Johnson is trying to win for the second time in seven days, along with positioning himself to be the top seed at the Tour Championship, which would allow him to start the tournament with a two-shot lead under the staggered start.                                                                          For players like Niemann, Hughes and Scott, they are simply trying to get to East Lake in Atlanta. All of them are one round away on a golf course where small mistakes can lead to bogeys or worse on just about every hole.

Mayor Ryan Stanley asked if his concerns were about the lack of mask usage by those in the audience or other issues.                          Copple said the majority of those in the audience did not wear masks, and there was a capacity set for the meeting room in order to observe social distancing, but that was not followed.                          “The agenda clearly specified that seating was limited to a certain number,” Copple said. “That number was greatly exceeded. There was a majority of the people without masks. There was some very derogatory comments that were made while speakers were speaking; one I considered a verbal assault.”                          The agenda limited the audience number inside the room to 45, but a number of others stood around the room when the chairs were filled.                          Audience outbursts                          The first outburst in the meeting came after on the city’s acting health department director, Dan Pekarek, was asked by the council to speak on the city’s status with COVID-19 infections. Pekarek said the city had been trending down but in the last few days had seen cases go up because of community spread and because some university students returning to school had tested positive.                          The mayor asked if the health department had any recommendations to the council.                          “Obviously the things I have been saying all along since March are the same things I continue to say. Those things that are important for us to do The social distancing is still very important, the mask usage, the hand-washing and sanitizing services, staying home if you’re sick.                          “We do support the mask ordinance. We think that is important component of overall response to the COVID, just like social distancing is important, the mask usage is very important as well.”                          There was an outburst in the audience with people talking back, and a few yelling “Where’s the science? Where’s the death rate?”                          After the health director was jeered for his comments, the mayor gave his first admonition to the audience, saying, “Before we jump into public comments, we are going to maintain this as a very professional dialogue. Let’s try to be cordial here. We want to listen to you, and I certainly understand the passion you have, and I respect that. If we could just work through this, I would appreciate that.”                          About two dozen people signed up to speak about whether the city should the extend the mask ordinance in place at the time and other business restriction measures taken as precautions because of the COVID-19 pandemic. About a dozen more submitted written comments that the city clerk read aloud.                          Mocking and jeering                          A family doctor, Michael Knapp, was one of those who spoke in favor of the mask requirement. He suggested the city keep the mask ordinance but relax its capacity restrictions on businesses.                          After he spoke, there was murmuring in the crowd and the mayor again called for the audience to be respectful of others speaking.                          A few speakers said their business sales were down because of the mask mandate.                          One resident and business owner, Josh Shackles, said there were two factors pushing sales down. “One is the bad attitude” that has been displayed by mask resisters going to other towns to shop, he said. Some audience members laughed loudly and jeered Shackles.                          The mayor again asked people to be respectful, which caused more murmurs in the audience and someone shouting “Well, he wasn’t respectful.”                          One speaker preached that the restrictions put in place were born out of evil.                          Audience response                          Abbie Covington, one of the organizers of a July protest of the mask ordinance held in front of City Hall, has attended several council meetings including the meeting Aug. 17. She said she encouraged some other residents to come and speak.                          “I do my best to encourage others to remain respectful of both the council members and the proceedings during council meetings,” she said. “After two other meetings where we had already made our thoughts known, over a month of having a mandate in place with people on the verge of losing everything and being ignored through it all, a lot of citizens were understandably angry with our elected officials and felt that being disruptive was the only way to get through to them.”                          In response to the council discussion regarding enforcement, Covington said, “I will add, however, that I do support the council and the mayor in attempting to keep council meetings orderly and give all citizens the opportunities to speak regardless of their position on any given issue.”                          Shocking comments                          During the council’s discussion, Copple, who was elected earlier this year, said that because he is new, he did not know what the rules and proper procedures are for dealing with situations such as those that caused his concern.                          “The number that were here that was well above the posted number was my greatest concern, because if we’re going to have a rule, let’s follow it,” Copple said.                          The mayor replied, “When it comes to the number of people here, I think that comes from a lack of preparation beforehand to control that. It’s hard to figure out who to throw out when there’s more than allotted. We need to address that early not late, before the meeting started.                          “Second, when it comes to the masks, we’ve got plenty of exclusions on our mask ordinance, and it’s hard to prove that someone’s not hitting that,” Stanley said.                          The mayor asked council to discuss what should be done when there are outbursts, saying “in one significant outburst, it was more barbs coming from the corners of the room. What would have been a better way to handle it?”                          Councilman Anthony Monteleone said “there is a certain sanctity to this place that we should try to uphold. Most people who spoke at the last meeting spoke from their heart and were polite and respectful to the other people who spoke. There were three people that routinely shot barbs and verbally accosted speakers they did not agree with.

But with fans kept firmly at arm's length, told by the government that it was best to stay home and watch the racing on television, the Tour lost much of its festive atmosphere. There was very little of the usual up-close communing between athletes and their adoring public that made the venerable 117-year-old rolling roadshow unique among sports events in more carefree times.                                                  Powering past thin crowds on the finishing straight in Nice that would usually have been crammed with spectators rows deep, Norwegian rider Alexander Kristoff won the first stage with a fearsome final sprint. He celebrated by giving a COVID-sensible fist bump to a teammate.                                                  Winning Stage 1 earned Kristoff the first yellow jersey of the 2020 Tour, which he will wear as the race leader on Sunday's Stage 2 that loops into the mountains behind Nice. Usually, a race official or a VIP would have helped him slip into the iconic jersey, one of the most coveted and recognizable in sports. But not this year, with social distancing the priority.                                                  Kristoff stood alone on the winner's podium, flanked by a host and a hostess a safe distance away. He then disappeared backstage to wriggle into the jersey himself, before coming back out to pose for photos. Still, the thrill of wearing the jersey for first time in his eight Tours more than outweighed the weirdness.                                                  "An amazing feeling,” he told reporters at the finish. "It means a lot for my career and a stage win shows I can still be up there even at 33 years old and with four kids.”                                                  With infections rising steadily across France, the Tour has no guarantees of reaching the finish in Paris on Sept. 20. Riders will have daily health checks and coronavirus tests during the race, and can be tossed out if they fail them. Entire teams could be sent home if two or more riders or staff test positive for COVID-19 within a week. Fans have been told not to approach riders for selfies or autographs and to always wear masks.                                                  Jean-Michel Blanquer, the French minister in charge of sports, was upbeat at the start Saturday, saying the Tour only has a "very slim” chance of being canceled before Paris but also cautioning that "everything is possible.”                                                  "That type of thing could happen but of course I hope that it won’t and I think that it won’t because the Tour organizers have done an extraordinary job,” he said.                                                  The crowd-control and social-distancing measures sucked much of the usual boisterous joy out of the Tour's first day. An eerie silence, and a thin crowd kept well away across an empty square, greeted riders as they paraded on stage at the start. Even a stone statue that overlooked the strange scene wore a mask, marked "protect ourselves."                                                  Still, roadside fans were grateful for the spectacle, after gruesome months of mounting deaths in France — now at 30,600 — and lives turned upside down by the virus. The European soccer championships and the Olympic Games were postponed to 2021 and scores of other events have been canceled. But the Tour, delayed from July, survived and is becoming a gauge of the feasibility of continuing to hold sporting mega-events during the pandemic.                                                  The sight of the peloton zooming past the corner that he chose by Nice's port caused 32-year-old tennis teacher Benjamin Sand to beam, thrilled by the riders' speed through the bend.                                                  "We’re so lucky,” he said. "It’s such a breath of fresh air.”                                                  Fans were also rewarded with high drama on the 156-km first stage that did three loops around Nice and hilly backcountry to the city's north. Rain storms turned the tarmac so slick that riders eventually made a pact between themselves out on the road to dial back the pace after multiple crashes.                                                  Among the most dramatic was Colombian rider Miguel Angel Lopez skidding headfirst into a road sign. He labored on to the finish. Another crash took out a heap of riders in the dash to the line on Nice's splendid seafront. The defending champion, Egan Bernal, suffered the blow of having two of his support riders on the Ineos team involved in painful pileups.                                                  "People were crashing almost on every corner," said Kristoff. "It was really slippy out there.”

Timely intervention by an alert plumber helped in averting a major train accident in Uttar Pradesh's Moradabad district. The incident happened on Saturday. Chandrasen Saini, a plumber, was on his way to relieve himself when he spotted a crack on the railway track, minutes before the Amritsar-Howrah parcel train, with two military compartments attached, was scheduled to cross the track. "I started waving a red cloth and the loco pilot managed to apply the brakes in time," Saini who lives in Katghar said.      The military compartments had a few Army personnel on board. The parcel train with 24 coaches was moving from Amritsar to Howrah and was crossing Bhaisiya village under Katghar in Uttar Pradesh on the Delhi-Lucknow down railway line when Saini raised the alarm.      "There was some kind of sparkle near the railway track when a train was passing through it. After the train passed, I went to take a closer look and found that there was a crack. Thereafter, another train was approaching the track and I sensed that an accident was possible due to the wide gap. I waved a red cloth at the loco pilot who saw it and immediately applied the brakes," Saini said.      Soon after, senior officials and the maintenance team rushed to the spot. According to the Divisional Railway Manager of Moradabad, Tarun Prakash, train movement on the concerned railway track was suspended for around three hours. Maintenance work was carried out after which the train moved on.      Moreover, similar incidents have taken place here in the past. Last month, two carriages of Rajpura-bound goods train had a breakdown which led to the derailment of coaches at Chandausi railway station.      In December, two coaches of Moradabad-Kathgodam passenger train had derailed during shunting in the outer yard of the Moradabad railway station.

Congress will still have access to classified written reports, but lawmakers will no longer be able to question officials from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) about what they learn.                                                                  Democrats in Congress reacted with fury, describing the move as "shameful" and accusing Trump of covering up Russian interference.                                                                  "As usual, President Trump is lying and projecting. Trump fired the last DNI for briefing Congress on Russian efforts to help his campaign," Schiff tweeted.                                                                  "Now he's ending briefings altogether. Trump doesn't want the American people to know about Russia's efforts to aid his re-election."                                                                  Schiff and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called in a separate statement for the administration and intelligence community to resume the briefings.                                                                  "If they are unwilling to, we will consider the full range of tools available to the House to compel compliance," they said.                                                                  DNI John Ratcliffe wrote to the top lawmakers from both parties in the House and Senate intelligence committees explaining the change, in a letter dated Aug. 28, which was circulated in U.S. media Saturday.                                                                  "I believe this approach helps ensure, to the maximum extent possible, that the information ODNI provides the Congress in support of your oversight responsibilities on elections security, foreign malign influence, and election interference is not misunderstood nor politicized," he wrote.                                                                  "It will also better protect our sources and methods and most sensitive intelligence from additional unauthorized disclosures or misuse."                                                                  White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said during a visit with Trump to hurricane-hit Louisiana and Texas Saturday that "the last time they gave briefings, a few members went out and talked to the press, disclosed information that they shouldn't have disclosed."                                                                  But Senate Intelligence Vice Chairman Mark Warner called the decision to stop in-person briefings an "unprecedented attempt to politicize an issue — protecting our democracy from foreign intervention — that should be nonpartisan."                                                                  Members of the U.S. intelligence committee as well as former FBI chief Robert Mueller have said publicly that Moscow is reprising its 2016 campaign to help Trump win the election.                                                                  William Evanina, director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, warned earlier this month that China, Russia and Iran were all seeking to interfere, using online disinformation and other means.                                                                  The Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee earlier in August released the most detailed report to date on Russian interference in 2016.                                                                  It accused the Trump campaign of welcoming Moscow's help, and set out new information on contacts between Russian intelligence officials and Trump's inner circle.                                                                  Trump has never criticized Russia over the issue and infamously sided with President Vladimir Putin over his own intelligence agencies at a 2018 summit in Helsinki.

Sherry Catarcio                                                      New Brighton                                                      Sherry Catarcio, 77, of New Brighton, passed away peacefully Thursday, August 27, 2020, at Good Samaritan Hospice of Heritage Valley Hospital in Beaver.                                                      Born July 25, 1943, in New Brighton, Pa., she was the daughter of the late James C. and Elsie (Allman) Radcliffe and was married July 11, 1986, to Gerald "Jerry" A. Catarcio.                                                      Sherry attended New Brighton High School and graduated from CCBC with a degree in accounting. She worked at Boffo Motors for 13 years. Sherry enjoyed attending ball games, playing cards, bingo, going to the casino, and dancing. She loyally watched the Pens, Pirates, and Steelers while eating French Vanilla ice cream - her favorite treat.                                                      Sherry was a devoted wife and spent 13 years caring for her husband Jerry after he was tragically struck by a drunk driver. From 1991 until 2004, she was a Victim's Advocate for MADD, sharing her story, hoping she could reach even just one person! We all know she did that and more. Her story and others like it helped to shape the changes made to DUI laws, giving voices to the victims and their families.                                                       In addition to her parents, she was preceded in death by her beloved husband, Jerry and her brother, James "Bubby" Radcliffe.                                                      She is survived by her two children, David (Shelly) Houk of New Brighton, and Lori (Larry) Boord of Freedom. She also leaves behind five grandchildren, Elyse (Josh) Janectic, Ian, Sam, and Stephanie Houk, and Jason Boord; two great-grandchildren, Lillya and Caleb Janectic; her loving sister, Rae (Steve) Lupo; and numerous nieces and nephews, cousins, and many dear friends.                                                      Sherry will always be remembered as a STRONG, caring, warm-hearted wife, mother and grandmother with a mind as sharp as a tack and a sense of humor.                                                      Friends will be received Tuesday, September 1st from 2 to 4 p.m. and 6 to 8 p.m. at the SAUL-GABAUER FUNERAL HOME, INC., 273 Route 68, Rochester (adjacent to Sylvania Hills Memorial Park Mausoleum) where a Memorial Service will follow at 10 a.m. on Wednesday, September 2nd, with Pastor Donald MacNeil officiating.

I due, il proprietario della struttura e un amico che lo stava aiutando, sono precipitati da un’altezza di circa tre metri. La situazione nell’immediatezza è apparsa grave e la moglie del proprietario ha chiamato immediatamente i soccorsi. Solo che l’ambulanza si è trovata in grossa difficoltà non riuscendo a raggiungere i feriti, proprio perché si trovavano in aperta campagna. E si è rischiato di perdere minuti preziosi. Allora è dovuta intervenire la Protezione di Civile tolfetana e che ha scortato il mezzo di soccorso fino a dove si trovavano i feriti. Il proprietario è uscito miracolosamente illeso dalla caduta mentre l’amico è arrivato a terra sbattendo la faccia. Per questo motivo la prassi prevede l’allertamento dell’elisoccorso, atterrato poi a pochi metri dal capannone. Si è reso necessario il trasferimento al policlinico Gemelli anche se tuttavia l’uomo è rimasto sempre vigile e alla fine se l’è cavata con la frattura di un polso e qualche escoriazione.

Mr.Ghosh maybe a retired lieutenant colonel, but he hasn't really stopped sniffing out danger in the air. Indeed, in Episode 3 of _HT Neighbour 's Kitchen_, he is shown to be suspicious of his wife. Now, only time will tell what it is all about, and whether Mr.Ghosh manages to get to the bottom of the truth.                                                                                   _HT Neighbour 's Kitchen_ is a web series launched by Hindustan Times, in association with Glen India. Set in Delhi, it's a story of four neighbours and how, over a period of time, they become great companions. There are four primary characters--Mr. & Mrs. Ghosh, Tanmay, a chef-in-the-making, and Anamika, a nutritionist. There's also Alexi, who is Anamika's boyfriend, and he is one person that you should probably look out for!                                                                                  Meanwhile, in this episode, Anamika is also shown to be falling sick. Although she takes shelter at the Ghosh's, she doesn't want to visit a doctor. The Ghosh's and Tanmay try to persuade her, but to no avail.

The mansion consists of four stories and 14 rooms. It has double brick walls with a 10-inch airspace between them to allow for ventilation. It was heated in the winter by coal-burning fireplaces located throughout; the two in the drawing room are made of Carrara marble. The Galighers also enjoyed a form of air conditioning. Raising the lid of the dome, seen from the second and third floors, in conjunction with the skylight on the roof, would pull hot air out of the house. A further sign of luxury and wealth, they had two bathrooms with running water pumped from an artesian well.

With his NASCAR Cup Series Playoff hopes on the line, Hendrick Motorsports’ driver William Byron earned his first career victory Saturday night at Daytona International Speedway in the Coke Zero Sugar 400 regular season finale.                          The victory was an automatic berth into the Playoffs for the 22-year old Byron – a hard-fought trophy in a typically full-contact, high-emotion contest on NASCAR’s famed Daytona high-banks to settle the Playoff field.                           The only two Playoff positions still up for grabs on the night were filled by Byron and Matt DiBenedetto, who earned the 16th and final Playoff position with a 12th place effort – a mere six points better than seven-time series champion Jimmie Johnson who nursed a badly-damaged car home to a 17th-place finish.

A new worry faces Nebraska school districts that reopened their buildings to students this fall.                                                                          What if someone sues, claiming their son or daughter caught COVID-19 because of a district’s negligence?                                                                          An insurance company that helps cover major claims for 174 Nebraska school districts and educational service units has made it clear that it won’t pay claims this school year related to communicable diseases like COVID-19.

A weekly salary of £180,000, per _Spotrac_, makes him the fourth-highest paid member of the squad, but it’s arguable the Gunners don’t get nearly out of him as they hope to from, say, Willian, who is on a similarly large pay packet.
 After three years in the Premier League he has 37 goals. There’s far more to his game than just putting the ball in the back of the net, but it’s still a fairly low-key return for a player who was once the most wanted No. 9 in European football.
 So with those factors in mind and the wider squad regeneration taking place, perhaps it’s time to allow the French striker to leave... and then sign another in Edouard.
 Now 22 years old, the Celtic man has outgrown the Scottish top flight; 11 goals in six under-21 matches for France suggest he has outgrown that, too.
 If he wants to take the next step and be a contender for a spot in the senior France set up ahead of next summer's European Championships, he needs to make a move.

Sports crackles with stories of magnificent comebacks and come-from-behind victories. However, there is equal romance in the epic meltdowns. These are about dreams turning to nightmares, ambitions being cruelly crushed, and heroes being reduced to villains.
 The most recent of these happened earlier in August, when fancied Barcelona, with Lionel Messi to boot, let Bayern Munich pump in eight goals against them in the Champions League semi-finals in Lisbon, Portugal. This wasn’t a defeat, a loss which the club that has won the UEFA Champions League five times, could shrug off easily. This was a disgrace, a breakdown of such gargantuan proportions that Jonathan Wilson in The Guardian termed it “a performance that became shameful in its ineptitude.”
 It recalled a similar disintegration six years ago in the semi-finals of the World Cup when hosts Brazil were humiliated 1-7 by Germany at home. Halfway through, with the visitors up 5-0, the Brazilian crowd which had paid astronomical prices to be at the stadium, was applauding the Germans. After the first couple of goals the Brazilians seemed to be paralysed on the pitch, incapable of defending as well as attacking. On the day that it mattered most, the Selecao had simply choked.

_Editor’s note: Auto Doctor columns are not available at this time due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Classic Classics will publish in the place of Auto Doctor until further notice._                                           Alan Hais needed personal transportation to get around the Washington, D.C. area when he was a young engineer in 1971, so he answered an ad offering a 1953 Chrysler New Yorker Deluxe convertible for only $300. The elegant convertible, one of only 950 made, had been purchased new by an embassy in the nation's capital. The base price was $3,945.                                          "I had to think twice about it," he says. "It had been repainted, but it was a mature car that appealed to me." Besides, how wrong can you go for $300? He climbed behind the three-spoke steering wheel, fired up the still-powerful 331-cubic-inch Hemi V-8, and, with 180 horsepower at his command, steered the 4,295-pound convertible home. "I made it home with no trouble at all," he reports.                                          During the next three decades, Hais slowly accumulated parts that he knew would be instrumental for restoration. The catalyst for that task came when the power brakes were barely functional. When a nearby shop agreed to do the work, "It was like having a child accepted at a four-year college," he says.                                          The two-barrel carburetor was rebuilt, a new exhaust system was fabricated and the steering drag link was replaced. "Piece by piece," Hais says, his car was restored. "There was very little rust," he says. "It is a solid car."                                          The poor quality chrome was sent to Pennsylvania for replating. The Chrysler was then stripped down to bare metal before being repainted in the original maroon hue. The maroon leather upholstery was replaced, as was the maroon carpeting. The maroon padded upper dashboard remains original, as do the black-painted lower dashboard and the window frames.                                          A tan top replaced the original black convertible top. A maroon leather boot was made to dress up the car's appearance when the top is down. Courtesy lights illuminate the rear passenger compartment. The big car is moved by a Fluid Drive transmission. A Safety Clutch eases operation. The shift pattern from the left is Park-Low-Neutral-Drive. The handbrake serves as a parking gear.                                          Optional equipment on the big car includes heater, AM radio, fog lamps, air conditioner, power steering, outside mirrors, locking gas cap, power Vacu-Ease brakes, and Kelsey-Hayes wire wheels.                                          This was the third year that Chrysler offered the Hemi engine. Five quarts of oil keep it lubricated while 26 quarts of coolant keep the temperature under control. On the floor between the Safety Clutch and the Vacu-Ease brake is the windshield washer activator.                                          Although the speedometer is ready to record speeds up to 120 mph, Hais says, "It can cruise at 80 mph and it'll probably do 100 mph." Looking at the restored car, Hais says, "It gives me a great sense of accomplishment."                                           _— Vern Parker, Motor Matters_

Saturday’s work was a service project for members of the Joplin Daybreak Rotary.                          Jon Schwarten, a member from Webb City, brought his three Webb City students, Emily, 6; Jackson, 9; and Nate, 12, to help their Joplin schoolmates.                          “Getting all muddy, that’s about all,” said Jackson Schwarten of the event.                          “It’s fun to get outside,” Nate Schwarten added.                          Jon Schwarten said he brings his kids to as many of the Rotary service projects as he can.                          “Rotary does a lot of things like water stops where we hand out water during runs, and I always bring them to those kinds of things,” Jon Schwarten said. “It gives my wife a break from the kids, so we get the kids out on weekends to do service projects. They’ve never gone to one of these service events and not had fun.”                          Wischmeyer said the garden program will follow the West Central students when they move to the new Dover Hill school in a couple of years.
