I am trying to replace the battery on a portable Amp/DAC and it has a battery labelled:






 PL-M10 Li-Ion Polymer 4800mAH 3.7V






 My Google Fu hasn't resulted in a suitable off the shelf replacement with those search terms.


 Would any battery of that spec, with the correct connectors on it, suffice? The battery has a Red, Yellow, and Black cable and a white connector on it.


 If I am trying to work out if the battery itself is dead, could I put a multi- meter on the PCB on the channels leading to those leads? Should that give me an indication that power is getting to the PCB, if it's plugged into the power source (USB in this instance)?






 Any assistance gratefully accepted.

DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) — At least 29 Rohingya refugees from a fishing boat floating for weeks in the Bay of Bengal have landed on an island in southern Bangladesh, officials said Sunday.
 The refugees, including 15 women and six children, landed on Bhasan Char island on Saturday and are believed to be from one of several boats stuck at sea, said Tonmoy Das, the chief local government official in Noakhali district.
 Das said food, doctors and a team of 10 policemen were sent to the island to take care of the refugees.
 An official from Bangladesh's Refugee Commissioner’s office in Cox's Bazar district said the office was aware of the development. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media.
 Rights groups said recently that hundreds of Rohingya are stranded on at least two fishing trawlers between Bangladesh and Malaysia. The refugees reportedly attempted to illegally reach Malaysia, but failed because of strict patrols to keep out the coronavirus.
 The United Nations, the British government and Human Rights Watch have recently urged Bangladesh to shelter all the refugees floating at sea, but the government had a lukewarm response, saying all other nations in the Bay of Bengal region should also share the responsibility of sheltering them.
