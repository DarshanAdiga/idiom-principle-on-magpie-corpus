Resident _Buffy  _grownup Anthony Stewart Head, who wasn't at the  _EW_ reunion in person, was quoted in Golden's 2017 book  _Buffy the Vampire: 20 Years of Slaying_  that the crew and cast "were just so lovely, so welcoming. It was really a family affair," thanks largely to the environment created by Whedon.
 His young daughters, Emily and Daisy, would come to the set, he said, and Hannigan and Gellar were like big sisters to the girls.
 "I hung out with everyone, pretty much," Head recalled. "I spent a lot of time with Nicky and Alyson, and Emma [Caulfield, who played vengeance demon with a heart of gold Anya]. Couldn't really spend much time with Sarah Michelle--I've spent a lot of time since, whenever I visit [the U.S.]--but because she was working all the time. Hung out with David, hung out with James. Hung out with Seth a bit--I mean the bottom line is we all stayed really friendly."
 It figures he was the one out of everyone mentioned who couldn't make the reunion. He did, of course, contribute an interview and tweeted afterward, "Here's to 20 years and a wonderful group of people x."

Technical chart claims that Zosano Pharma Corporation (ZSAN) would settle between $0.69/share to $0.75/share level. However, if the stock price goes below the $0.6 mark, then the market for Zosano Pharma Corporation becomes much weaker. If that happens, the stock price might even plunge as low as $0.56 for its downside target. The stock is currently in the red zone of MACD, with the indicator reading -0.11. Traders are always alerted for the move of a stock above or below the zero line due to the fact that the reading is an indicator of the position of the short-term average relative to the long-term average. If the MACD is above the zero line, then the short-term average relative is above that of the long-term average, thus implying an upward momentum. Vice versa is the case if the MACD is below the zero line.

Catalans Dragons statement
 Catalans Dragons confirm that, following meetings with the Préfecture des Pyrénées-Orientales and in accordance with the decisions taken by the French government due to concerns over Covid-19, the Super League round 7 game against Leeds Rhinos, scheduled one Saturday 14 March at 6 pm, will be played behind closed doors at the Gilbert Brutus stadium.
 A meeting has also been organized between the RFL, Super League and both clubs to look at the different options.
 Catalans Dragons Chairman Bernard Guasch: "Following the unprecedented decision of the French Minister of Sports, the Dragons' choice was to switch the fixtures. Unfortunately, the Leeds Rhinos club did not accept our request.
 We then proposed to postpone the match and to play it later in the season, midweek or weekend depending on the Cup results of each club. We even offer a financial compensation to Leeds club for their additional travelling costs.
 Remember that we were in the same situation a month ago in Wakefield without solution or possible compensation for the canceled game due to bad weather. To date, we are still waiting for Wakefield and the RFL to reschedule this match.
 Unfortunately the RFL, the Leeds Rhinos and the RFL Board did not hear our reasons, even after appealing the decision, and told us to play the game as scheduled.
 We strongly regret this decision which will hugely impact the finances of the club with revenues already anticipated in our annual budget.
 Unable to find a solution to choose only 1,000 supporters from our 5,500 season ticket holders and sponsors, the club has chosen to play behind closed doors.
 Details of ticket refund procedures will be confirmed as soon as possible.

"It is important to note that this curative treatment is high-risk, and only used as a last resort for patients with HIV who also have life-threatening haematological malignancies," Gupta said. "Therefore, this is not a treatment that would be offered widely to patients with HIV who are on successful antiretroviral treatment."
 Since Castillejo is only the second reported patient to undergo this experimental treatment successfully, the authors note that he will require continued, but much less frequent, monitoring for re-emergence of the virus.
 Sharon Lewin, director of the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity at the University of Melbourne, said that the case was an "exciting advance" but should be viewed in context.
 "It's hard to know if this is a cure, only time will tell, but this is looking very promising," Lewin said in a statement sent to CNN.
 "This case is an exciting advance, but we need to also place it in context -- curing people of HIV via a bone marrow transplant is just not a viable option on any kind of scale. We need to constantly reiterate the importance of, prevention, early testing and treatment adherence as the pillars of the current global response to HIV/AIDS. And maintain the search for an HIV cure," she added.
 In an interview with the New York Times, Castillejo said that he decided to reveal his identity after years of difficult treatments and moments of despair.
 "This is a unique position to be in, a unique and very humbling position," Castillejo told the newspaper. "I want to be an ambassador of hope."
 Kat Smithson, director of policy at the National AIDS Trust, applauded Castillejo for sharing his experience, adding that there is a stigma around HIV which can make it difficult for some people to seek help.
 "His story helps raise much-needed awareness of HIV, but broader than that it's a story about incredible resilience, determination and hope," she said in a statement to CNN.
