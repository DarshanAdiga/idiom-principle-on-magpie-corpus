 Council voted 5-2 at its meeting Monday, July 13, 2020 not to debate its emergency ordinance that would have restricted bar service and reduced private gatherings to 10 persons or less. Violators, who hosted larger gatherings, would have faced a fine of $200 for the first offense and $400 for any second or subsequent offenses, according to Newark City Code, under the ordinance.
 The business community expressed concern about the timing of the ordinance and the short notice, The Newark Post reported.

There's something here for everyone. There's a turbocharged engine churning out 310 horsepower and 400 pound-feet of torque for the power-hungry. There are off-road clearances and specs designed to show up Mr. Seven Slots in the rough stuff. There's even a new unibody kid brother, the Bronco Sport crossover, for those whose tastes run to the less extreme. I'll cover that model in a separate Bronco Sport in-depth article and video, so for now, let's focus on the big boi.
 It's been around 25 years since the last Bronco rode off into the sunset, and it's not entirely clear why Ford kept the nameplate on ice for so long. Yes, the model's reputation is obviously juiced with some unusual baggage, but that was hardly the automaker's fault. Either way, it can't have been easy to stomach watching Jeep average well over 200,000 profit-rich Wrangler sales every year for the last half decade. No matter, the 2021 Ford Bronco is here now -- or, more precisely, it's here for reservations now. Initial deliveries are promised next spring.

New Bronco has great-looking, historically aware design
 First off, the new Bronco looks _the business_. I typically stay poker-faced upon seeing a new vehicle for the first time, and honestly, with as many photo leaks as this SUV has seen, you'd think I would've managed to play it straight when Ford extended an early invite to a Michigan off-road park to check it out.
 No such luck.
 I'm here to tell you, Ford has absolutely nailed the look of this new truck. In both two-door and four-door forms, the 2021 Bronco has the sort of stance, proportion and detailing that not only give this SUV the necessary aura of utility, but lend the vehicle massive presence.

When Beijing implemented its new security law in Hong Kong two weeks ago, officials assured it would only affect a small handful of citizens. However, China now says the weekend's opposition election in Hong Kong may have been illegal under the new security law, meaning all 600,000+ voters who participated may have broken it. The government has said the opposition primary's organizers were trying to stage "a serious provocation to the current electoral system" by achieving a parliamentary majority and, with it, significant legislative power. To critics, the announcement is an example of how China can easily move the goalposts to leverage the new law, which has caused widespread concern and unrest.
