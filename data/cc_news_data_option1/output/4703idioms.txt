The 29-year-old Aboushi made his second start of the season and the 36th of his career on Sunday, helping Detroit beat Washington 30-27.
 The Lions made a statement as a team last summer, choosing not to practice as a form of protest after a Black man, Jacob Blake, was shot by police in Wisconsin. Aboushi was front and center as his teammates spoke to reporters about their decision outside the team's practice facility.
 And as a player in the powerful league, coincidently playing in an area with a large Arab American population, Aboushi wants to use his voice to speak up for people in his parents' homeland.
 "There is this call of not staying silent and using our places of position to elevate those that feel unheard and unseen for such a long time," said U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, a Democrat from Detroit. "People can relate to us as activists — me as a girl from southwest Detroit, him the NFL player."
 Aboushi's parents emigrated to New York after both were born in east Jerusalem, a part of the world that regularly makes international news.
 On Monday, European diplomats visited the site of an Israeli planned settlement expansion in east Jerusalem that threatens to cut off parts of the city claimed by Palestinians from the West Bank. Israel has long dismissed international criticism of settlement activity.
 Palestinians want a future state that includes east Jerusalem and the West Bank — territories occupied by Israel in the 1967 war — and view settlements as a major obstacle to peace.
 Aboushi visited the West Bank in 2009, when he talked with orphans and said he witnessed Palestinians being held at checkpoints.
 "It was a huge eye-opener for me as far as what it's like to be back in Palestine in its current situation right now with the occupation of Israel," he said. "The media doesn't show that and continues to kind of turn a blind eye to the mistreatment of the Palestinian people."
 Aboushi plays in relative obscurity as an offensive linemen, but he's hailed in the Arab American community in the Motor City.
 Azzam Elder, an attorney in the area, met Aboushi shortly after he signed with the Lions last year and has become one of his many new friends.
 "Oday Aboushi is basically another beautiful story in the American dream," said Elder, who is also Palestinian-American. "From a Palestinian perspective, it's just beautiful to be able to sit in the stands and watch all these great players and happen to know somebody who happens to have your background."
 When Aboushi moved to Michigan, he posted on Twitter that he was looking to help mosques and families with iftar, a feast for Muslims after they break their fast during Ramadan. He subsequently gave back in one of the many ways he has served the community in Detroit.
 Aboushi, who speaks Arabic, was among about a dozen Muslim athletes honored in 2011 at a reception hosted by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton at the State Department in Washington while he attended the University of Virginia.
 When he was in college, one of his roommates, Michael Strauss, became one of his best friends and proved a Muslim man and a Jewish teammate could do more than simply coexist.
 "When he got on campus, we kind of clicked," Aboushi recalled. "We just were complete opposite, but we both had very similar hearts and passion and that's what helped bring us together. He has always been respectful of my beliefs, and I've been respectful of his beliefs. We had a lot of conversations about religion, cultures and traditions. He's someone that will be in my life probably for the rest of my life and someone that I consider family."
 Aboushi considers his teammates, of all backgrounds, his brothers. He praised former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick for sparking a movement in 2016, when he started taking a knee during the national anthem to protest systemic racism.
 NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said last summer the league was wrong for not listening to players fighting for racial equality and encouraged them to protest peacefully.
 "We're all fighting for the same thing," Aboushi told the AP. "Palestinians are going through a very similar situation as we have here with African Americans as far as the way they're being treated through systematic oppression.
 "I feel like this is the time, more than ever, to talk about it and to continue to enlighten people and to let people know that, `Hey, it's not only something that's happening in America. This is a worldwide issue.' This is something as a world that we can continue to work on to get better."

CINCINNATI (FOX19) - With Black Friday just a week and a half away, the busy shopping day might be a little different this year, like a lot of things, because of the COVID-19 pandemic.For the holiday season, Kenwood Towne Center is offering a new amenity for guests looking to streamline their shopping experience.They call it “spot holder” and it is meant to help shoppers manage lengthy wait times and lines outside of stores.Shoppers join a queue from their phone, choose a shopping time and wait for a text with a confirmation.When it is your time to shop, a store employee will meet you at door and you can head right in.Some shoppers are on board with the idea, but others say it might not be beneficial.“I think if it were any other year when we didn’t have a global pandemic, going on that would be a great idea, but I just think it doesn’t move the needle," said Shawn Frost. "I think people are going to come and shop whenever they want to shop at, I would just suggest people shop online.”Dustin Bloison says he will give the spot holder a try.“I mean yeah I would definitely use it," said Bloison. "I’m going to check it out for sure.”Right now, 14 stores are participating in “spot holder” and team members at the mall say they are adding participating retailers every week.“Spot holder” will stay at the Kenwood Towne Center through mid- January.See a spelling or grammar error in our story?

The first round of what they believe will be an annual vaccine will go to healthcare workers on the front lines of the fight against COVID-19. These are the doctors, nurses and other hospital workers who spend their days caring for patients that have the virus.


  Next will be long term care and assisted living patients then essential workers and then the general public.


  As for the vaccines, they’re new and that brings feelings of doubt or even fear for some. Dr. Lee Norman with the Kansas Department of Health and Environment says while the medical professionals have been great at explaining the science side of things, they need to take more time to address what he calls the “social psychology” of it to try and help calm fears.


  “If you were a vaccine hesitant person, I don’t think it’s the science that’s going to help you decide…it’s going to be human to human conversation," said Dr. Norman.


  More than anything, they stress unsafe vaccinations simply are not given in this country and they say if you’re hesitant have a heart to heart about your fears with your doctor.


  As for those of you who’ve already had a confirmed case of COVID-19, doctors warn your immunity likely only lasts for about three months. So stay vigilant about wearing your mask and keeping your distance in public.

My family and I came here nine years ago as strangers to this city.

Our boys have grown up watching games at Wrigley, loving the team, and running around the outfield on off days, trying to lose as many balls as possible into the ivy; selfishly, nothing can match the feeling of having them smile and rush into my arms to sing and watch the crowd during every seventh-inning stretch, no matter how old they are getting. The front office and team have enjoyed countless champagne celebrations together and even commiserated a few tough games with fans at Murphy’s under the L flag. The constant banter, laughs and friendships formed in the office, up in the box, and in the clubhouse will last a lifetime. (Unfortunately, so will the hamstring tears from our spring training soccer scrimmages and postseason basketball marathons.) We’ll cherish the pre-game chats with Billy Williams about Cubs history and all the great teams that came up just short, and then the privilege of getting to see the joy on his face as he slipped on his World Series ring for the first time. I keep remembering that feeling from the carefree and expectant days just as we started to turn the corner on the rebuild, walking home after games inconspicuously amongst the fans — all in the jerseys of their new favorite players — hearing them talk excitedly about the upstart young team, feeling their confidence surging. And we’ll never forget the generations of families celebrating together at the parade, nor the images of Cubs pennants and hats draped on gravestones for family members who did not quite live to see the day.

Adds Biden aide on transition decision and pandemic relief)
 By Sarah N. Lynch, Susan Heavey and Trevor Hunnicutt
 WASHINGTON/WILMINGTON, Del., Nov 15 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump appeared on Sunday to acknowledge losing the U.S. election but then backtracked and said he concedes "nothing" while a top aide to President-elect Joe Biden called a seamless transition vital for national security and combating the coronavirus pandemic.
 Biden, due to take office on Jan. 20, defeated Trump in the Nov. 3 election by winning a series of battleground states that the Republican incumbent had won in 2016. The Democratic former vice president also won the national popular vote by at least 5.5 million votes, or 3.6 percentage points, with some ballots still being counted.
 Trump, who is pursuing long-shot litigation contesting election results in several states, made conflicting statements in a series of Twitter posts in which he initially appeared to admit for the first time publicly that Biden won, then reversed course. Trump also repeated unfounded claims of widespread voter fraud.
 "He won because the Election was Rigged," Trump wrote, not referring to Biden by name. "NO VOTE WATCHERS OR OBSERVERS allowed, vote tabulated by a Radical Left privately owned company, Dominion, with a bad reputation & bum equipment that couldn't even qualify for Texas (which I won by a lot!), the Fake & Silent Media, & more!"
 About 90 minutes later, Trump wrote, "He only won in the eyes of the FAKE NEWS MEDIA. I concede NOTHING! We have a long way to go. This was a RIGGED ELECTION!"
 "WE WILL WIN!" he added.
 Speaking on NBC's "Meet the Press" program, Biden's pick for White House chief of staff, Ron Klain, said, "Donald Trump's Twitter feed doesn't make Joe Biden president or not president. The American people did that."
 The decision by the General Services Administration, headed by a Trump appointee, not to recognize Biden as president-elect has prevented Biden and his team from gaining access to government office space and funding normally afforded to an incoming administration to ensure a smooth transition.
 Klain called on the agency to formally recognize Biden, saying it is critical to ensure that the president-elect receives intelligence briefings describing national security threats before taking office and to facilitate coordination with the White House coronavirus task force.
 "Joe Biden is going to become president of the U.S. in the midst of an ongoing crisis. That has to be a seamless transition," Klain said.
 Klain also urged Congress to pass bipartisan coronavirus relief legislation. Talks on such legislation stalled before the election. Democratic congressional leaders last week called upon Republican lawmakers to join them in passing a relief measure before the end of the year.
 "This could be a first example of bipartisan action post-election," Klain said.
 Klain added that Biden's team plans to meet with Pfizer Inc and other drugmakers starting this week regarding COVID-19 vaccines. Klain previously said a smooth transition is necessary to ensure the government is prepared to roll out a vaccine early next year.
 Tackling the pandemic will be a paramount priority for Biden, with the United States tallying record numbers of COVID-19 cases in recent days. More than 245,000 Americans have died of COVID-19.
 Speaking on CNN's "State of the Union" program, Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious diseases expert, also urged speedy transition efforts to help confront the pandemic.
 LEGAL STRATEGY
 Trump's campaign has filed lawsuits seeking to overturn the results in multiple states, though without success. Legal experts have said the litigation stands little chance of altering the election's outcome.
 Election officials of both parties have said there is no evidence of major irregularities. Democrats and other critics have accused Trump of trying to delegitimize Biden's victory and undermine public confidence in the U.S. electoral process. Before the election, Trump had refused to commit to a peaceful transfer of power.
 Senator Bernie Sanders, one of Biden's main challengers for the Democratic presidential nomination, criticized Trump's post-election conduct.
 "Trump will have the distinction of doing more than any person in the history of this country in undermining American democracy. The idea that he continues to tell his supporters that the only reason he may have lost this election was because of fraud is an absolutely disgraceful, un-American thing to do," Sanders said on "State of the Union."
 John Bolton, Trump's former national security adviser turned critic, on Sunday called on Republicans to acknowledge Biden's victory. Bolton last week accused his fellow Republicans of "coddling" and "kowtowing" to Trump as the incumbent despite his defeat.
 "I think it's very important for leaders of the Republican Party to explain to our voters, who are not as stupid as the Democrats think, that in fact Trump has lost the election and his claims of election fraud are baseless," Bolton said on ABC's "This Week" program.
 Biden has won 306 votes in the state-by-state Electoral College system that determines the presidential winner, according to Edison Research, far more than the 270 needed to secure a majority. States are in the process of certifying their election results. The Electoral College meets to formally vote for the new president on Dec. 14.

Corsairs, filibusters, swashbucklers, buccaneers, renegades: the rich lexicon of piracy in our vocabulary of rebellion attests the role they have long played in the collective imagination. But there is a complex history from which they sprang on onto the global stage. The rise of the pirate as a dangerously desirable figure is intimately linked to the maritime expansion conducted by several European nations in the early modern period, that coalesced into the creation of Empires and colonies through which European powers came to dominate world history by the 19th century. This module reads against the grain of those dominant narratives of colonialism as world-making by focusing on the pirate as an interruptive force, who derails the movement of peoples, goods, ideas, and laws across the maritime routes linking the Atlantic and Indian Ocean worlds. Important tools in the module will be the reading practices of postcolonial theory, which will teach us to extract and assess this alternative history of the post/colonial pirate.

Pollen grains preserved in sediments and sedimentary rocks provide records of how different groups of plants have evolved and the environmental factors that have played a role in this evolution. Their identification is based on observations under the microscope by plant scientists and palynologists, like Oboh-Ikuenobe, who study ancient pollen. Correctly measuring and identifying the shape and structure of a pollen grain can be incredibly difficult because there is no identification record for many of these ancient pollens, the researchers say.

THE NEST   Written and directed by Sean Durkin   With Jude Law, Carrie Coon, Oona Roche, Charlie Shotwell   Rated R      The setting is a ranch house on a nice spread of land in woodsy, suburban New York. The time is ... well, we don't know the exact year, but President Reagan is talking on the radio. Mom and dad and their two kids appear to be happy together. Allison (Carrie Coon) has some rental properties and gives horse riding lessons. Daughter Samantha (Oona Roche) - from Allison's first marriage - is a budding gymnast. Son Ben (Charlie Shotwell) is happy to play soccer out back with dad. Dad is Rory (Jude Law), who drives the kids to school each day, then gets lost in thought about how well he was doing in London - before they relocated to the States - and how his career (he's some sort of entrepreneur) is now floundering.      It's in that ranch house that Rory makes a secret phone call, to his old boss in London, and when all is said and done, announces to Allison that they're moving to London because "I have an opportunity there, and I'm running out of options here."      He goes on to tell her the first of many lies about the details of that opportunity, but it's soon clear that lying is part of what he does. Rory knows his way around his business, and he's a great talker and charmer, but his life and career are all about putting up a good front, convincing people that he's more ... better ... richer than he really is.      Despite opposition from Allison and the kids, the family changes settings, and is soon living in a huge manse out in the English countryside (Rory brags to Ben that Led Zeppelin once recorded an album there; is it another lie?). He's back in an office, working as a commodities broker for his old boss Arthur (Michael Culkin, whose IMDB bio mentions that he's "unmarried and lives in London and Norfolk with several dogs and a llama"), and has plans to move up the ladder within the firm.      But Rory keeps getting in his own way. He wants to show off Allison at a big party. She's not comfortable with that. He tells everyone he meets that he sends his kids to expensive schools. No one cares. He explains to Allison that Arthur approached him about the job, but she finds out that's not at all the way it happened.      The film is both a study of an ambitious man who's out of control, and of a family that's coming apart because of him. Mom and dad and the two kids are definitely not happy together. He isn't up to the task at work, she's forced to take on a menial job, Ben is bullied at school, Samantha is becoming surly. They're being stretched to their limits, and we worry about all four of them.      Writer-director Sean Durkin, whose only previous feature was the intense and unsettling "Martha Marcy May Marlene," has sharpened his skills here, both in his script's words and the way he has his actors deliver them. Most noteworthy are the two-hander scenes between Law and Coon, and the ones with Law and Culkin. There's also a great, forlorn soliloquy from Law in the back seat of a cab about once being rich.      One of the most impressive feats that Durkin pulls off is keeping the film on an even keel, making it appear that nothing much is happening, though all the while hints are being dropped as to where everything is heading.      Personal funds dwindle, confrontations about it occur, more lies are told, tensions rise, deals fall apart, desperation sets in. Things turn verbally and emotionally angry. The story has an uncertain ending, but Durkin doesn't leave viewers in a despondent mood. He manages to blend in the tiniest glimmer of hope that things just might work out.      "The Nest" is now available on all cable and digital VOD platforms.   Ed Symkus can be reached at esymkus@rcn.com.

During the NFL's weekly health and safety call with the media, the NFL's chief medical officer Dr. Allen Sills said the league and each team looks at data at the local and state level and works with local public health authorities in making all decisions related to Covid-19.


  "No local case clusters have been reported traced back to NFL games," league vice president of communications Brian McCarthy said on the call.


  Dr. Umair Shah, who heads the Harris County, Texas, health department, may not agree with Jones, saying that the pandemic is "far from over."


  "This is like the first half -- 2020 was like in a football game the first half," Shah told CNN. "The holidays and where we are right now is halftime. We have a whole half ahead of us."


  "If we don't do the right things during the halftime to strategize and get our act together so we're ready for the second half, we're going to be overrun by our opponent, and that's Covid-19," Shah told CNN's Poppy Harlow and Jim Sciutto.

As coronavirus cases spike around the country, hospitalizations reach new records and President Donald Trump continues to refuse to concede the election, lawmakers on Capitol Hill are less and less confident that any stimulus deal can be reached in the lame duck with focus turning instead to a government spending negotiation that must be finished by December 11.


  "I am kind of discouraged frankly right now. I was encouraged when I saw ... Vice President Biden tell Schumer and Pelosi he would like to see a package done. So far there doesn't seem to be any interest on the Democratic side," Sen. John Cornyn, a Republican from Texas, said Tuesday. "Just as important as what the topline is what the content is, so that is why it is hard to say what the appropriate topline number is, but it does need to be focused and there is still a lot of people hurting and a lot of questions about logistics of the vaccine, which we are going to need continued support from Congress."


  Aides on both sides say that serious conversations have ceased over the stimulus even as the US cases of coronavirus have soared past 11 million and as questions remain about whether there is adequate funding to distribute a vaccine. While the Department of Health and Human Services has said that there will be adequate money to ensure Americans have access to a vaccine once one is approved, aides on both sides of the aisle on Capitol Hill have pointed to the fact that the focus of the CARES Act funding for vaccines in the spring was development, not distribution. Money remaining is a fraction of the $5 billion to $6 billion US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield said earlier this fall was needed for distribution.

Chitrakoot (Uttar Pradesh) [India], November 18 (ANI): The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has arrested a junior engineer of Uttar Pradesh irrigation department for allegedly sexually assaulting several children, making a video of the act and selling it on the dark web, officials said on Tuesday.   According to the CBI, the arrested accused was identified as Chitrakoot- resident Ram Bhawan.   A case was registered against the accused and other unidentified persons for their alleged involvement in the sexual abuse of children in the districts of Banda, Chitrakoot, and the surrounding areas in Uttar Pradesh.  
 "Apart from the physical abuse of children, the accused also allegedly recorded their acts using their mobile phones, laptops and other electronic devices. It was further alleged that these photographs and videos containing child sexual abuse material were published using the facility of the internet. It was also alleged that the accused used the dark web for sale, transmission and sharing of such CSAM content with other individuals," the CBI said in a statement.   The probe agency also said that searches were conducted at the residence of the accused which led to the recovery of Rs 8 lakh cash, mobile phones, laptops, web-camera and other electronic storage devices including pen drives, memory cards and several sex toys.   "The accused allegedly used these electronic items and gadgets to lure children falling in the age group of 5-16 years. The scrutiny of the emails of the accused has revealed that he was allegedly in constant touch with several individuals (both Indian and foreign nationals) for the purpose of sharing child sexual abuse material," the statement said.   "The accused has allegedly created and shared a huge quantity of child sexually abusive material, over the years, through the internet using various social media platforms and websites over darknet, etc," it added.   After Bhawan's arrest from his office on Tuesday, irrigation department executive engineer Vipin Bihari Singh said, "I have received a letter from the CBI and in line with that, I have suspended the arrested official. He was arrested today." (ANI)

By Sarah N. Lynch, Susan Heavey and Trevor Hunnicutt
 WASHINGTON/WILMINGTON, Del., Nov 15 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump appeared on Sunday to acknowledge losing the U.S. election but then backtracked and said he concedes "nothing", while President-elect Joe Biden focused on tackling the coronavirus pandemic and set meetings with pharmaceutical companies developing vaccines.
 Ron Klain, Biden's pick for White House chief of staff, urged Trump's administration to allow a seamless transition, calling it vital for national security and combating COVID-19.
 The pandemic will be a paramount concern for Biden, who takes office on Jan. 20. Klain said Biden's scientific advisors will meet with Pfizer Inc and other drugmakers starting this week to prepare for the "giant logistical project" of widespread vaccination against a virus that has killed more than 245,000 Americans and left millions more unemployed.
 Biden defeated Trump in the Nov. 3 election by winning a series of battleground states that the Republican incumbent had won in 2016. The Democratic former vice president also won the national popular vote by at least 5.5 million votes, or 3.6 percentage points, with some ballots still being counted.
 Trump, pursuing long-shot litigation contesting election results in several states, made conflicting statements in a series of Twitter posts. He initially appeared to admit for the first time publicly that Biden won, then reversed course. Trump also repeated unfounded claims of widespread voter fraud.
 "He won because the Election was Rigged," Trump wrote, not referring to Biden by name, adding a list of complaints about vote counting. About 90 minutes later, Trump wrote, "He only won in the eyes of the FAKE NEWS MEDIA. I concede NOTHING! We have a long way to go. This was a RIGGED ELECTION!"
 "WE WILL WIN!" he added.
 Speaking on NBC's "Meet the Press" program, Klain said, "Donald Trump's Twitter feed doesn't make Joe Biden president or not president. The American people did that."
 The decision by the General Services Administration, headed by a Trump appointee, not to recognize Biden as president-elect has prevented Biden and his team from gaining access to government office space and funding normally afforded to an incoming administration to ensure a smooth transition.
 Klain called on the agency to formally recognize Biden, saying it is critical to ensure the president-elect receives intelligence briefings before taking office and to facilitate coordination with the White House coronavirus task force.
 "Joe Biden is going to become president of the U.S. in the midst of an ongoing crisis. That has to be a seamless transition," Klain said.
 Klain urged Congress to pass bipartisan coronavirus relief legislation by the end of the year. Talks on such legislation stalled before the election. Democratic congressional leaders last week called upon Republican lawmakers to join them in passing a relief measure.
 VACCINE CHALLENGE
 Klain previously said a smooth transition is necessary to ensure the government is prepared to roll out a COVID-19 vaccine early next year. Pfizer announced last week that its vaccine candidate proved more than 90% effective in initial trial results, giving hope that widespread vaccination in the coming months could help get the pandemic under control.
 Other companies also are in advanced stages of developing promising vaccines.
 "You know, it's great to have a vaccine, but vaccines don't save lives. Vaccinations save lives," Klain said. "And that means you've got to get that vaccine into people's arms all over this country."
 The mechanics of manufacture and distribution lies with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Klain added, making it important for Biden's team to be able to coordinate with current HHS officials.
 Speaking on CNN's "State of the Union" program, Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious diseases expert and a White House task force member, underscored the importance of a smooth transition in pandemic control efforts.
 "Of course it would be better if we could start working with them," Fauci said of coordination between the existing task force and Biden's team.
 Fauci welcomed Klain's selection, saying he had been "terrific" under former President Barack Obama in managing the U.S. response to a 2014 Ebola outbreak.
 LEGAL STRATEGY
 Trump's campaign has filed lawsuits seeking to overturn the results in multiple states, without success. Legal experts have said the litigation stands little chance of altering the election's outcome. Election officials of both parties have said there is no evidence of major irregularities.
 Control of the U.S. Senate will be decided by two January runoff elections in Georgia, which will be important for the fate of Biden's ambitious legislative agenda. Klain said the president-elect may campaign in Georgia ahead of the runoffs.
 Senator Bernie Sanders, one of Biden's main challengers for the Democratic presidential nomination, criticized Trump's post-election conduct.
 "Trump will have the distinction of doing more than any person in the history of this country in undermining American democracy. The idea that he continues to tell his supporters that the only reason he may have lost this election was because of fraud is an absolutely disgraceful, un-American thing to do," Sanders said on "State of the Union."

Giuliani filed Tuesday morning to represent Trump in the case. He has not entered an appearance in federal court since 1992, according to online court records. That was the year before he was elected mayor.
 The Trump campaign wants to prevent certification of results that give President-elect Joe Biden the state's 20 electoral votes, suing over election procedures that were not uniform across the state. Giuliani has promised a raft of lawsuits and to provide Trump with evidence of voter fraud in the drive to overturn the election result.
 Pennsylvania Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar, a Democrat, has asked to have the lawsuit thrown out, calling its allegations in court filings "at best, garden-variety irregularities."
 Brann scheduled the hearing to discuss the campaign's request for a temporary restraining order as well as the defendants' request to have the case dismissed.
 After Pittsburgh lawyers dropped out of representing Trump's campaign on Friday, Philadelphia election lawyer Linda Kerns and two Texas lawyers also filed to withdraw Monday.
 Camp Hill lawyer Mark Scaringi, a losing candidate in the 2012 Republican U.S. Senate primary, notified the judge he was stepping in but did not get the delay he sought.
 The Associated Press has declared Biden the winner of the presidential contest, but Trump has refused to concede and is blocking Biden's efforts toward a smoother transition of power. With Georgia the only uncalled state, Biden has collected at least 290 electoral votes — just enough that overturning Pennsylvania's result would not open an avenue to a second term for Trump.
 Biden's margin in Pennsylvania is now more than 73,000 votes.
 There is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election, and experts say Trump's various lawsuits have no chance of reversing the outcome in a single state, let alone the election. In fact, election officials from both political parties have stated publicly that the election went well, and international observers confirmed there were no serious irregularities.
 The issues Trump's campaign and its allies have pointed to are typical in every election: problems with signatures, secrecy envelopes and postal marks on mail-in ballots, as well as the potential for a small number of ballots miscast or lost.
 Trump's campaign has also launched legal challenges complaining that its poll watchers were unable to scrutinize the voting process. Many of those challenges were tossed out by judges, some within hours.
 Trump's legal team has so far scored just two small victories. In one case, a court allowed their observers to stand a little closer to election workers processing mail-in ballots in Philadelphia. In another, Pennsylvania counties were ordered not to count mail-in or absentee ballots for which the voter didn't submit valid identification within six days after the election, but that ruling is expected to affect no more than a few thousand ballots.
 A slew of other legal challenges brought by Republicans have quickly been swatted down or withdrawn.
 On Monday, a conservative group that has been pushing baseless claims that absentee voting is rife with fraud abruptly dropped lawsuits it had filed in Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Georgia with no explanation.
 One Trump campaign case that is still pending seeks to block the certification of election results in Michigan, but the state appeals court on Monday denied another bid to stop the certification of Detroit-area votes.
 In Pennsylvania, the Trump legal challenge being heard Tuesday centers on how some counties let voters fix, or "cure," mail-in ballots that lacked secrecy envelopes or had other problems. The Trump campaign's lawsuit claims counties' inconsistent practices violated constitutional rights of due process and equal protection under the law and resulted in the "unlawful dilution or debasement" of properly cast votes.
 "Democratic heavy counties," the lawsuit alleges, notified voters about the lack of secrecy envelopes or other problems in time for some to fix them, but counties in Republican regions "followed the law and did not provide a notice and cure process, disenfranchising many."
 The lawsuit seeks to stop Boockvar and election boards in seven Biden-majority counties that are co-defendants from counting absentee and mail-in ballots that the Republican president's campaign claims were "improperly permitted to be cured."
 Boockvar's lawyers described Trump's claims as generalized grievances and speculative injuries that would not warrant throwing out the election results.
 They told Brann that other counties could have permitted their voters to fix problem mail-in ballots, but chose not to.
 "Election practices need not cater to the lowest common denominator, and Plaintiffs' arguments would improperly penalize those counties that are enfranchising voters by helping them avoid ballot disqualification," they wrote.

"The 5k isn't really about getting exercise, it was about giving encouragement," said Pastor Andy Blacksher of Faithbridge Church. "Jesus taught us to love and take care of one another - this is our highest calling as followers of Christ, and it's what medical professionals do every single day.  To say this has been a difficult time for frontline workers is an understatement.  We simply want to say thank you in a small but tangible way."   Terri Hall, CTFA, Director of Fund Development at Lake Regional Health System, says she is grateful to the many people who have stepped forward to help hospital employees through these unprecedented times.   "These meals were a wonderful opportunity that came at a great time. I was overwhelmed when the church called to tell me how many meals they had. Even the thank you notes on the bags - it's just been so wonderfully supportive for our staff," she said.  "Even with a mask on, I can still see the smile in their eyes when we pass out these meals."   Many lake organizations donated thousands of hand-sewn masks and meals at the beginning of the pandemic in March, but support has dwindled a bit over the last six months.  Barb Bierman, board chair at Faithbridge Church, was inspired to find a creative way for church members to have some fun, be in fellowship with one another, and support exhausted healthcare workers, when she came upon the virtual 5K idea through her connections to another United Methodist faith community.   "It's been such a long process for healthcare workers these last few months and it's not slowing down," she said. "So anything we can do for these workers. I feel sorry that they're having to face this every single day, not knowing where the light is at the end of the tunnel.  I am happy that our church is able to bless the healthcare workers at this time, and my heart is warmed to hear how appreciative they were at the hospital to receive the meals."   Stephanie Dehner, community liaiason for Lake Regional, says she knows that lake healthcare workers truly felt the love and support, and offers ways for the greater community to continue to bless workers during this pandemic, including their new white ribbon initiative.   "This month, we're inviting community members to show their support for all frontline workers by displaying a white ribbon at their homes and businesses," she says. "Follow us on Facebook for details. Community members also can make an impact by making a tax-deductible donation to help us continue to provide exceptional health care at lakeregional.com/donate. And don't underestimate the impact of kind words. A simple thank you -- in person or on social media -- uplifts our team."

Hi everyone. What a storm. Just like everyone else I have tree branches down. So, guess what I’m doing this weekend? Very lucky not to have any on the house. Kim wasn’t so lucky. They have a big cleanup of limbs also. Jo had lines down but never lost power. I’m sure there are a lot of similar stories out there. We did loss our power around 1 a.m., Tuesday, and got it back Wednesday around 5 p.m. You don’t know how spoiled we are until you don’t have it. So nice to walk into a warm house with lights.
 Our Veteran’s Lunch went very well. We served 34 veterans and a total of 103 meals for the day. This would not be possible without the extra help we had. Linda Hansen, Linda Schnell and Judy Magill helped get things ready and helped bag meals while I was doing carry outs. Randy and Kaye Rager helped with the extra home deliveries while Lisa Anderson and Cathy Farber were busy doing regular deliveries. Jo, Kim and Scot kept everything in the kitchen moving right along. Thank you to all of you, it all went great. Also a big Thank You to everyone who made donations to help pay for the veterans’ meals. We had a great response and the support that everyone has for our veterans is very heart-warming. You helped to make it a special day. We have a wonderful community that is very thoughtful. You make my job very rewarding.
 We received a donation of a very nice Nebraska Husker reversible winter coat size XXL. We are going to have a raffle for this coat.

"The men and women throughout our country -- they're suffering because of Covid and we're not doing a damn thing to help them," Sen. Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat said, getting visibly angry. "That's wrong."


  The divide between Republicans and Democrats continues to be over how much money each side is willing to spend. Democrats -- including President-elect Joe Biden -- have urged Senate Republicans to pass House Democrats' Heroes Act, which totals more than $2 trillion.


  "Congress should come together and pass a Covid relief package like the Heroes Act," Biden said Monday during public remarks.


  Republicans, meanwhile, have made it clear they aren't willing to spend much north of $1 trillion. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell confirmed Tuesday that he had no private meetings with Democratic leaders over Covid relief saying that he was "open to a targeted bill" along the lines of half a trillion dollars, but that he had seen "no evidence" that Democrats were open to that.


  "I think right now the Democrats would have to come a long ways back to reality to us to get a bill," Sen. Dick Shelby, an Alabama Republican and the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee said Tuesday.

Four athletes from Waterloo’s state runner-up volleyball team were recognized by the Wisconsin Volleyball Coaches Association in Division 3 voting held recently.
 Named as unanimous selections to the first team were senior setter/outside hitters Brooke Mosher and Joslyn Wolff. Junior libero Michaela Riege and sophomore setter/outside hitter Sophia Schneider received honorable mention.
 Mosher was an all-around force for the Pirates with 461 kills, 385 assists, 252 digs, 67 aces and 50 blocks. The University of Illinois commit was also named a 2nd team Under Armour All-American last week.
 “Brooke brings so many things to the table and is that rare player that really can do it all at a very elite level,” Waterloo volleyball coach Christy Mosher said. “This season, she left the best for last, averaging the most kills, assists and digs per set in her whole career.”
 Wolff, who will play collegiately at UW-Oshkosh next year, finished the season with 259 kills, 208 digs, 199 assists and 73 aces.
 “I was so happy Joslyn broke through to first team all state this year,” coach Mosher said. “Her ability to terminate against the high level competition we faced all season was the best of her career, and that along with her serving and ability to set really pushed her over the top with voters.”
 Riege led the Pirates in digs with 355 and also put up 104 assists and served 45 aces.
 “If I’ve said it once I’ll say it 1,000 more times — if we can control first contact, we will win a lot of games,” coach Mosher said. “Michaela is the key to that quality first touch and had an exceptional year especially, improving her serve receive game and back row leadership.”
 Schneider gave the team a third setter/outside hitter option this season. She totalled 272 assists, 146 kills and 180 digs in her second varsity season.
 “Sophia worked hard during quarantine and came in with a lot of confidence both attacking and as a setter,” coach Mosher said. “That translated into running our fast tempo offense, while also being a go-to hitter on either pin. Coaches noted her as a big key to our success this year.”

The module will also teach students to nuance standard maritime historiographies through literary reading practices, as well as evaluate the metaphoric application of piracy to contemporary, interruptive, economic practices.

Adds Biden remarks with CEOs)
 By Trevor Hunnicutt and Doina Chiacu
 WILMINGTON, Del./WASHINGTON, Nov 16 (Reuters) - P resident-elect Joe Biden consulted the CEOs of top U.S. companies and labor leaders on Monday before a planned speech on fixing the pandemic-battered economy and welcomed further progress in COVID-19 vaccine development.
 Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris held a midday conference call with several chief executives including General Motors Co's Mary Barra, Microsoft Corp's Satya Nadella, Target Corp's Brian Cornell and Gap Inc's Sonia Syngal.
 Also taking part, according to Biden's transition team, were AFL-CIO president Richard Trumka and the heads of the Service Employees International Union, the United Auto Workers and two other large unions.
 "We have a lot of problems facing us," the Democratic president-elect told participants at the beginning of a videoconference from his home state of Delaware seen by reporters. "It's going to take all of us working together."
 Biden started the meeting speaking about his love of Corvettes with the head of GM and the auto workers union that represents some of the automaker's employees. Biden then switched to a more somber tone as he addressed the "pretty dark" state of the economy because of the coronavirus.
 "We all agree on these common goals," Biden told the participants, before using a campaign slogan. "We agree that we can't just build back the economy ... We have to build back better."
 Biden earlier on Monday said Moderna Inc's announcement that its experimental COVID-19 vaccine was 94.5% effective based on interim data from a late-stage trial provided fresh hope for beating the novel coronavirus. Coupled with positive results last week on a rival Pfizer Inc shot, Moderna's news added to optimism that widespread vaccination in the coming months could help tame the pandemic.
 With U.S. COVID-19 cases surging as the new administration prepares to take office on Jan. 20, Biden and Harris were due to make remarks about the economy at 1:45 pm ET (1845 GMT) on rebuilding an economy that has suffered millions of job losses during a pandemic that has killed more than 246,000 people in the United States.
 TRUMP DIGS IN
 Biden moved ahead with economic planning even as Republican President Donald Trump on Monday again refused to accept his election loss. Trump's national security adviser, Robert O'Brien, said on Monday he was prepared to ensure a professional transition to Biden's team.
 "If there is a new administration, look, they deserve some time to come in and implement their policies," O'Brien said. "If the Biden-Harris ticket is determined to be the winner, and obviously things look like that now, we'll have a very professional transition from the National Security Council, there's no question about it."
 Biden beat Trump in the Nov. 3 election by the same 306-232 margin in the state-by-state Electoral College that prompted Trump to proclaim a "landslide" when he defeated Hillary Clinton in 2016. A former vice president, Biden also won the national popular vote by at least 5.5 million votes, or 3.6 percentage points, with ballots still being counted.
 Trump has made no headway with legal challenges in multiple states so far.
 "I won the Election!" Trump wrote on Monday on Twitter, again falsely claiming victory. Twitter posted a disclaimer saying, "Official sources called this election differently."
 Major business groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Business Roundtable already have congratulated Biden on his victory and said they looked forward to working with him, even as Trump has refused to concede.
 Unlike in 2008, when the country elected Democrat Barack Obama and his running mate Biden as the global economy teetered from the sub-prime mortgage crisis, the worst of the current economic downturn may have passed already. Unemployment has come down sharply from its April peak of 14.7% to 6.9% and is projected to fall further throughout next year.
 Biden's scientific advisers will meet starting this week with pharmaceutical companies developing COVID-19 vaccines, according to a top Biden aide, in preparation for the logistical challenges of widespread vaccination after the Democrat takes office.
 Election officials from both parties have said there is no evidence of major irregularities. Federal election security officials have decried "unfounded claims" and expressed "utmost confidence" in the election's integrity.
 Trump suffered another setback when James Bopp, a conservative attorney, on Monday voluntarily withdrew lawsuits filed in federal courts seeking to block the states of Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin from certifying their election results. The lawsuits made unsubstantiated claims of illegal voting.
 Biden's top advisers said Trump's refusal to begin a transition could jeopardize the battle against the pandemic and inhibit vaccine distribution planning.
 Moderna was part of the Trump administration's Operation Warp Speed program aimed at expediting COVID-19 vaccine development. Unlike Pfizer's vaccine, Moderna's shot can be stored at normal fridge temperatures, which should make it easier to distribute.
 Other companies and groups also are in advanced stages of developing promising vaccines.

SeaDream's announcement comes during a U.S. cruise hiatus that will last through 2020. After halting cruises in March, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control lifted its cruise ban this month and put in place phased requirements companies must meet before resuming passenger sailings. The agency will require weekly PCR testing of crew members, pre-boarding PCR testing for passengers and masks for all crew.
 Dr. Kenneth George, chief medical officer of Barbados, said SeaDream 1 contacted the country during the cruise about passengers who had tested positive for COVID-19.
 Barbados health officials boarded the ship and tested passengers, confirming that nine people on the ship had COVID-19.
 "The nine individuals went to Harrison's Point, one of the individuals was [medically evacuated] out," he said. "The remaining passengers, who all tested negative, went out on commercial airlines and have left Barbados. We're looking to retest the crew at the moment."
 George said Barbados allowed the ship to dock in the country "after careful consideration."
 "We indicated we would allow them to port here but we were going to repeat the test based on our standards," he said. "The challenge with the rapid PCR test is if the test is positive, you're very likely to be positive. If the test is negative, you can still be harboring the virus and that's the challenge we have with the rapid PCR test."
 A few passengers currently remain at the country's isolation facilities, he said. The average length of time to stay there is 10 days, and none of the passengers there are showing symptoms.
 Barbados requires arrivals to show proof of a laboratory real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction PCR test. Even with that requirement, George said they have been finding "more and more people testing positive with a second test." Individuals from high-risk areas are retested four to four five days after their first test. During that time, individuals are required to be in a designated quarantine facility.
 The country does not use or endorse the use of rapid tests of any kinds, he said.
 "We have put a lot of controls in our system to make sure that passengers are safe," he said. "We don't allow persons to quarantine at home....We will continue to use our methodology, which has worked so far for us."
 "We support cruises returning to Barbados," he said. "But the cruise lines need to understand the requirements of Barbados and comply. We are not going to accept rapid tests on board. We are not going to accept antigen tests at this point."
 While some Caribbean countries have promoted the idea of a travel bubble between them, George raised concerns about changing positivity rates throughout the region.
 "The other issue is we need to be involved in the decisions because the fortunes within the Caribbean have been changing so [residents of those] countries are not necessarily low-risk individuals. The issue of the bubble is the bubble changes all the time."

I do plan on having a third chapter leading a baseball organization someday, though I do not expect it to be next year. I have seen first-hand the profound impact a baseball team, especially a championship team, can make on its community, and how team owners can become important forces for civic good. If and when the timing and opportunity and partners are right, I would like to join an ownership group. In the meantime, I would love to find a way to serve the game that has given me so much and am pursuing a few possible avenues to do just that.
