EASTON -- Leaders from Oliver Ames High School are warning students and families that attending large gatherings in the coming weeks could put in- person learning and sports in jeopardy.
 Principal Wes Paul and Athletic Director Bill Matthews said in a Friday message to community members that it has come to the school's attention that large social gatherings are being planned over the next two weekends that may involve Easton Public School students. It is rumored that adults may be hosting the gatherings, they said.
 "We implore every student and parent to provide leadership within the community to help shut down these gatherings," the letter states. "Think about the serious consequences of holding large parties."

 Parties and large gatherings have become "superspreaders" and the root cause of major COVID-19 cases, they wrote, citing state statistics.
 As a result, some communities have switched to fully remote learning and canceled sporting events, which could happen in Easton, the letter states.
 Students should exercise judgment and social responsibility modeled in school, and avoid participating in large gatherings, Paul and Matthews wrote.
 "(It's) a worthwhile sacrifice to give us the best chance possible to continue in-person school & sports," Matthews wrote Saturday on Twitter.
 Paul was not immediately available for comment Saturday.
 Superintendent Lisha Cabral declined to comment further, saying that Paul's message did a good job at communicating safety.
 Between Oct. 15 and 21, one Easton Public Schools student has tested positive for COVID-19, according to recent data from the state Department of Elementary and Secondary Education.
 Most other area school districts did not report cases among students during the same period, except for Southeastern Regional, which is located in Easton. One student and staff member there tested positive for the coronavirus during that period.
 Brockton and West Bridgewater each reported one case among district staff.
 There have been 372 positive COVID-19 cases in Easton, making the town a "green" community at low risk for the virus, according data from the state Department of Public Health.
 Neighboring communities like Brockton, Raynham and West Bridgewater are "red" communities at high risk for COVID-19 while Bridgewater and Mansfield are "yellow" towns at moderate risk, according to state data. Stoughton is currently "green," at low risk for COVID-19, like Easton.
 The Easton Board of Health has released tips for community members to celebrate a safe Halloween.
 Consistent with guidance from the CDC, the board recommends outdoor activities like looking at decorations, virtual celebrations or staying home to celebrate.
 Grab-and-go candy for trick-or-treating is recommended as a safer alternative. When outdoors, people should wear face covers -- costume masks don't count -- and bring hand sanitizer.
 The board says people should avoid any gatherings that exceed state gatherings limits. Crowded indoor haunted houses with screaming and costumes parties or hay and tractor rides with non-household members are not recommended.

BRIDGEWATER -- As students returned to college campuses this fall, many schools across the U.S. quickly experienced coronavirus outbreaks and took action against partying undergraduates.
 In Massachusetts, Merrimack College in North Andover was forced to temporarily switch to remote learning by late-September following an outbreak that led to about 70 positive COVID-19 cases.
 Earlier in September, Boston's Northeastern University acted swiftly and dismissed 11 first-year students for gathering at a hotel in violation of university and public health protocols.
 At Bridgewater State University, the highly contagious disease has largely been contained.

 Through Oct. 13, Bridgewater State had nine COVID-19 cases out of 6,594 total tests done since early August. That 0.13 percent positivity rate was well below the state's seven-day weighted average of positive tests and lower than many Massachusetts colleges.
 Now, the college is currently dealing with a "small cluster," including five cases associated with the men's soccer team, President Frederick W. Clark Jr. said Thursday afternoon. The latest round of testing revealed nine positive cases out of 1,326 tests conducted from Oct. 14 to 21.
 While the team doesn't have any games, they are holding noncontact training drills "under strict public health guidelines," said Chris Frazer, the executive director of the college's Wellness Center.
 "We have had really good success with our athletics and recreation department," Frazer said. "I would be hard-pressed to believe this came through practice and rather the natural congregation of close friends."
 The college is conducting additional testing of students and coaches associated with the soccer program regardless of whether they had contact with the positive students, Frazer said. The team's training program was supposed to conclude next week, but has been canceled for the rest of the semester, he said.
 Safety as a guiding principle
 Bridgewater State officials remain hopeful that the work put in since May to plan a safe return to campus will quickly contain what Frazer described as a "very small spike."
 Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs Karim Ismaili, who led the BSU Safe Return Task Force, began meeting in May with representatives from across campus, including faculty, staff and students. The group met for six weeks to set a framework and guiding principles that would allow the campus to reopen come August.
 "The most important thing we really focused on was safety," he said. "That was our guiding principle. It meant, and it was explicitly said, that our first principle would be to prioritize safety above all else. We wanted to make sure that science and data guided our decisions."
 The task force decided it was important to "de-densify," or reduce, the number of individuals on campus. Bridgewater State decided to only offer on-campus classes that needed to be taught in person -- only about 7 percent of all courses, Ismaili said. Those classes are taught partially online and other times in person, with all remaining courses at the college online.
 And forecasting a possible second wave of COVID-19, the college decided to conclude all in-person classes by Thanksgiving, finishing the semester remotely.
 "We did the planning. We thought through scenarios. We did the pivoting to online learning after Thanksgiving -- we made that decision early on," Ismaili said. "The university's focus on safety as a guiding principle, that put us in a position that by July we knew what we needed to execute, but also be open to ideas and be as creative as we could be."
 About 1,300 students decided to return to campus to live in residence halls, said Joseph Oravecz, the college's vice president for student affairs and enrollment management. The college offered single and double rooms.
 Oravecz said students have been following the college's health guidelines, including mask-wearing. In talking to students, he said he's heard that they're being vigilant because they fear an outbreak that would require the college to shut down, which they don't want.
 "Our student population is incredibly resilient," he said. "They have so much grit and tenacity. They want to do the right thing. They do a really good job in holding each other accountable."
 'Couldn't have done it without it'
 College officials said they knew having a testing plan in place was crucial to being able to reopen this fall.
 Bridgewater State is working with the Eli and Edythe L. Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard to conduct COVID-19 testing each week.
 All students living on campus are tested every other week -- divided into two cohorts by even and odd-numbered rooms in residence halls.
 Each Friday, an email is sent out by the Wellness Center to the students who will need to sign-up for a testing time on the following Tuesday or Wednesday. They select a time between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. one of the days, head over to the Dunn Conference Suites -- testing was initially done in a parking garage at the beginning of the semester -- and take a coronavirus test.
 Frazer said students are given a test tube with a bar code that has their name on it, they are then instructed to go outside and blow their nose and head back inside and be observed by a college nurse or medical provider as they conduct a self-administered molecular swab test.
 "It's the best kind of testing," Frazer said. "If you're positive, you really know you're positive, and if you're negative, we feel we know you're negative."
 The Broad Institute then collects the tests the same day and guarantees results within 24 hours. Typically, the results are much faster, as they were from Wednesday night to Thursday morning, when Frazer learned several students had tested positive.
 That's when the contact tracing begins.
 "The Wellness Center has access to the results database. We are aware of any positives first," he said. "Health services, a nurse practitioner or clinical staff, make the first call to the student for any medical questions they might have and figures out whether they're going to isolate on campus and move to a different room or go home and move off campus. We have a whole process to accommodate someone who is positive in our residence halls."
 Being able to test asymptomatic students on a regular basis -- something that didn't seem like a reality early on in planning for the fall semester -- is crucial, Frazer said.
 "We couldn't have done it without it," he said. "Particularly in the beginning, there was so much anxiety around what it means to have a diagnosis with COVID. We had students whose grandparents got really sick and were dying, family members were passing away. The news cycle mellowed because of other things going on, but there's no shortage of loss of life. There was a lot of trepidation and the routine testing helped give some peace of mind."
 Clark, the university's president, said he still feels "really good" about where Bridgewater State is at with only 18 total positive cases out of 7,290 tests so far -- a 0.23 percent positivity rate.
 He said the college's contact tracing protocols are working "really, really well" so that they can "stay on top of it very quickly" to contain the small number of new cases.
 The nine new cases come from one off-campus student who tested positive last week and eight students this week -- one on Tuesday and seven from Wednesday. Six of the eight who tested positive this week live on campus and two reside off campus. All eight students who recently tested positive are isolating and experiencing "very minor symptoms," Clark said.
 Bridgewater State officials say they still feel positioned well moving forward.
 "We know that things can change in a matter of moments," Ismaili said. "One thing I valued through the whole process was the real shared spirit of purpose. During a crisis, that's what you want to see. My expectations were blown away. There's collaboration, camaraderie, recognition that we have a noble purpose to focus on and do the best we can. I hope we can look back on this and say Bridgewater State rose to the occasion."

 # Opinion: We need leaders who support a vibrant manufacturing sector
 Brad Boehler
 View Comments
 One of the questions most important to Michigan voters is which candidates will do a better job growing the critical manufacturing sector of our economy in years ahead.
 Supporting a vibrant manufacturing sector is an important topic. That’s because due to COVID-19’s historic impact on Michigan’s manufacturing sector, and a lack of pro-manufacturing policies in place to help manufacturers, the future of manufacturing in our state, and across the United States, is in jeopardy.
 From cars to cranes and chippers, Michigan is known for being a manufacturing powerhouse. Manufacturing’s multiplier effect here – the impact an industry has on people and businesses outside the industry — is the largest in the nation with every $1 spent in manufacturing generating $1.89 in additional economic activity. Manufacturing makes up about 20% of Michigan’s gross state product and 14% of the state’s workforce — ranking fourth nationally.
 A big reason for that is the equipment manufacturing industry, which builds the equipment that helps American farmers feed our nation; construction workers fix and modernize our roads, highways, bridges, and power providers keep the lights on in our homes. It’s a big reason why the federal government declared equipment manufacturers an essential business throughout this pandemic so that our nation can fight the pandemic and rebuild our economy.
 My company, Morbark, LLC, is one of those manufacturers. After 60 years of growth, we now employ 600 men and women who build quality equipment like horizontal and tub grinders, tree and brush chippers, forestry mulchers, compact equipment and more, which our customers rely on across the state, the entire country, and the world. Overall, we’re one of many equipment manufacturers in Michigan who collectively support 117,000 good-paying jobs and contribute over $11 billion a year to the state’s economy.
 However, manufacturing in Michigan, and across the nation, is at a crossroads. For example, despite the importance of manufacturing, the U.S. share of global manufacturing has declined by as much as 36% in the last 15 years.
 We need more lawmakers in office who will work together to help to pass pro- manufacturing policies to keep manufacturing strong. For example, our nation’s infrastructure is in dire need of attention as the American Society of Civil Engineers now gives both Michigan and the United States a grade of D+. Elsewhere, our nation’s agricultural and rural communities are hurting. The U.S.-China trade war and weather extremes have further reduced production and profit for U.S. farmers, making it hard for them to make ends meet with farm bankruptcies increasing 24% from 2018 to 2019.
 Adding to these challenges is a global pandemic that’s devastated many Michigan manufacturers. The nation’s weakened demand for new manufactured products, especially new cars and trucks, is a big reason why manufacturers in Michigan are hurting more than anywhere else.
 The silver lining is that Michigan voters have a rare opportunity to correct course. No matter your party affiliation, it’s candidates’ platforms on issues like infrastructure, trade, and rural America that matter most at the end of the day. Michigan voters can make a difference.

Let me say specifically that the biggest of them all, owning about 35 per cent of the share of business in Nigeria, has opened a long negotiation with the Council to withdraw the suite from the Supreme Court and also pay out of court settlement. So, this was taken to the president and the president has approved that further negotiations should take place between Shippers’ Council, Federal Ministry of Justice and the Maersk Line and other companies have shown interest. I think the other 23 or 24 companies would follow suit. This is because of the tremendous respect they have for NSC. The Council is not an emasculator, but a regulator and that means we have to be democratic. Looking at the other side, we have helped them mutually. We have Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for settlement of such tariffs. It is just because of COVID-19, we would have signed that agreement; we have given it to the stakeholders - shippers, freight forwarders and they have made comments on those negotiations. Government has responsibility to make sure the atmosphere is conducive for private sectors to operate, the atmosphere is sometimes harsh. So, we appeal to government to do the roads, infrastructure, simplify the system and bring technology to bear on whatever system. On terminal operators, we have just been talking, but nothing concrete yet, but I guess everyone is trying, even at Shippers’ Council, we have those who would rather want the case to go to the Supreme Court because they are so confident, they want the Supreme Court to settle everything, but then dialogue is the best.

PLYMOUTH, Mass. (AP) -- Four centuries after white Europeans stepped off the Mayflower and onto America's shores, some descendants of the colonists are wrestling with the complicated legacy of their ancestors amid a global racial reckoning.
 There is immense pride among those who can trace their families back to the passengers who boarded the ship in Plymouth, England, in 1620 to flee religious persecution and realize a better life. Yet for some, the devastating impact that the Pilgrims' landing in New England had on Native Americans weighs heavily in this moment of unrest over systemic racism.
 In interviews with The Associated Press, Americans and Britons who can trace their ancestry either to the Pilgrims or the indigenous people who helped them survive talked openly about the need in 2020 to fairly tell the history.
 "Considering my ancestors helped incite the racial hierarchies that caused the need for these movements now, I do feel ashamed that that had to be part of history," said Olivia Musoke, 19, whose ancestor on her mother's side arrived in America on the Mayflower.
 Musoke, whose father is Black, said the pride she feels in coming from people who helped settle this country "gets diminished by the role they played in kind of manipulating and terrorizing people of color, which trickled down to the structures we have today."
 For some, it's a difficult issue to reconcile.
 "The pilgrims came out of religious persecution in England. And I'm very proud of the fact that they set off to create their own independent culture," said Seth Howland Handy, 53, another descendant of a Mayflower passenger. "But they came to a place where there was existing culture. And, you know, the history is not friendly and that is troublesome," he said.
 Handy said it's more important now than ever now to "recognize everyone's role in our history and the great diversity of this country." The U.S. was embroiled in civil unrest this summer, with protesters demanding justice for George Floyd and other Black Americans killed or injured by police.
 Ginny Mucciacco, a descendant of Mayflower passenger Degory Priest, said the Pilgrims' work ethic was admirable.
 "To have this tie to our early history is really, I won't say it's a privilege, an honor. But it's just something to be proud of because so many of them worked so hard, for so many years to help establish this country. And it's just very important to me," said Mucciacco, 90, of Dedham, Massachusetts.
 The soul-searching extends across the Atlantic to England, where Mayflower descendants say they, too, are trying to reconcile pride and prejudice.
 Vicky Cosstick, a Briton whose ancestors John Alden and Priscilla Mullins were passengers, said she's troubled by the suffering the indigenous people endured -- but she doesn't feel guilt.
 "I'm of course horrified and appalled to know what happened as a result of British colonialism in America and what happened to their Native American tribes and the Wampanoags," Cosstick said.
 "It's not as if they went to America in order to steal land from an indigenous population," she said. "Much of it was clearly wrong, but there are many stories that need to be told. And I think the anniversary gives a chance for all of those stories to be told."
 As the racial reckoning has brought new scrutiny to how African American history is taught in American schools, Native Americans have long pushed for the unvarnished stories of their ancestors to be heard.
 When the Pilgrims arrived at what we now know as Plymouth, Massachusetts, the Wampanoag tribe helped the exhausted settlers survive their first winter. But Native Americans also endured racism, oppression and new diseases brought by the European settlers.
 "We were exposed to disease. We were exposed to slavery. I mean, what happened here was people who came not just for religion -- that might have been their purpose of leaving their homeland -- but they came here and wanted to wipe out the existence of a whole culture," said Hazel Harding Currence, 78, of the Herring Pond Wampanoag Tribe of Cape Cod.
 Organizers of the events planned for this year to commemorate the 400th anniversary of the Mayflower's arrival pledged to amplify the voices of the Wampanoag, which have been marginalized in past years. Fifty years ago, state officials disinvited a leader of the Wampanoag Nation to the commemoration after learning his speech would bemoan the tribe's suffering.
 This year, many anniversary events were canceled or postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic.
 "We should have never been treated the way that we were, our ancestors," Currence said. "I think that if they were here now, if they were looking down on us, I think they'd be very proud at the movement that's going forward now."
 Even though the virus has put a damper on the commemoration, some members of the Wampanoag tribe say they're hopeful that the attention on the problem of systemic racism this year will help their voices and stories be heard in a way they haven't been before.
 "It's opening up everyone else's eyes to how unbalanced the world is and unequal," said Troy Currence, Hazel Harding Currence's son and a medicine man from the Herring Pond Wampanoag Tribe.
 "The world is spinning out of control. So I think more people are going to be aware and more sensitive and open to receiving a message like that," he said.

 Miller faced allegations in two federal trials after the FBI investigation and was asked about the school receiving notice during a media availability last week.
 “I’m not going to comment on anything that is around any investigation. That’s what I’m called to do as a member of our athletic departments, so I’m unable to comment,” he said Thursday.
 Miller sat out a game in 2018 after ESPN reported he was heard on an FBI wiretap discussing a $100,000 payment to future No. 1 NBA draft pick Deandre Ayton. Miller vehemently denied the report, and university President Robert C. Robbins announced a few days later that Miller would remain the Wildcats coach.

 The NCAA issued charges against Kansas last September. That case, involving five Level I violations, was accepted in July into the new Independent Accountability Resolution Process. Cases involving North Carolina State and LSU have also been recommended to the IARP.
