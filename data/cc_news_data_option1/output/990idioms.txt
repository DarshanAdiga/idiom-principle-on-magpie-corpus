What the team found was generally consistent with the findings that have already been published, as they detail in a companion paper in Systematic Reviews. While the vaccine didn’t cut the rate of cancers in the trials, that’s hardly surprising; most HPV infections are cleared by the body without causing any harm, the few that remain and trigger malignant growths typically take decades to do so, and most trials lasted no more than a few years. Meanwhile, the vaccine did appear to cut the number of early cell abnormalities that can progress to cancer, as well as HPV-treatment-related procedures such as cone biopsies of the cervix.

Every racetrack on the NASCAR circuit has been witness to amazing herculean accomplishments by superstar drivers. And a few of those efforts have simply transcended all of NASCAR, becoming legendary tales. One of the first unbelievable feats to ever happen at Bristol Motor Speedway and send shockwaves throughout the greater NASCAR community belonged to South Carolina racer Cale Yarborough.      In 1973, Yarborough completely dominated the BMS Spring Race. He was the fastest in practice. He won the pole. He took the lead at the green flag and he never looked back. Yarborough led every lap of the 1973 Southeastern 500, the ancestor of the modern day Food City 500.      Yes, you heard that correctly. He led all 500 laps. Every. Single. One. He didn’t have a single hiccup. Not a challenge from a rival. Not a blown tire. He didn’t get caught up in a crash. Not a loose lugnut. Not a $5 parts failure. Not a bad spark plug. Nothing. Not a single problem. That race was all Yarborough in his No. 11 Chevy that was tuned by Junior Johnson. When the checkered flag dropped, Yarborough became the first driver to accomplish leading every lap in a Cup Series race in NASCAR history.      While some have heard the legendary story, what many don’t know about Yarborough’s epic accomplishment at Bristol, is that he did it over a two week period. Yarborough led the first 52 laps on the race’s original date, Sunday, March 11th, before weather forced officials to postpone the finish. The circuit moved on down the road to run a race at Rockingham, N.C. the next weekend and then returned to Bristol on Sunday, March 25th to finish the Southeastern 500. Amazingly, Yarborough picked up right where he left off, by leading the remaining 448 laps without a glitch.      “It may be the single greatest accomplishment in the history of Bristol Motor Speedway,” said noted racing historian and journalist David McGee. “It’s absolutely amazing. I can’t imagine someone leading every lap of the race today. Cale was that dominant; that car was that good. He was putting cars a lap down within the first twenty laps absolutely dominate and that really set the stage for the dominance that Cale and Junior Johnson would have for most of the 1970s here. They came back in 1974 and won both races.”      Yarborough duplicated the feat in 1978 in Nashville, leading all 420 laps of a Cup Series race at the historic Fairgrounds Speedway. The only other time a driver has led a NASCAR Cup race from start to finish was when Jeff Burton did it in 2000 at New Hampshire Motor Speedway.      And on that magical day in Bristol, Yarborough was just on another level from the rest of his competition. And the drivers who he beat were certainly no powder puffs. He was racing against the best of the best at the time on the NASCAR circuit.      “To give you an idea of how good Cale was that day, Richard Petty ran second and Bobby Allison ran third,” McGee said. “Both are Hall of Fame drivers. They were both two laps down. Cale was completely untouchable.”      As the NASCAR Cup Series heads to Bristol Motor Speedway April 3-5 for the milestone 60th running of the Food City 500, the modern day relative of the Southeastern 500, race teams will be working hard to try and duplicate Yarborough’s incredible 1973 performance by leading all 500 laps in the new era of NASCAR, which includes three race stages during the event, with stage breaks at 125 laps, 250 laps and then onto 500 in the winner take all 250-lap final stage.      In addition to sweeping the BMS races in ’74, Yarborough also swept the BMS races in 1976 and ’77. He and Junior Johnson working together proved to be an unstoppable force on the East Tennessee bullring throughout the 1970s. He also added additional wins in 1978 and 1980. In total, Yarborough won nine races at BMS, forever leaving his mark on the “World’s Fastest Half-Mile.”      If you want to see many of the best NASCAR drivers try to win the pole and lead every lap like Yarborough did back in the 1970s, you’ll want to get your Food City 500 tickets now. NASCAR stars like BMS dominator Kyle Busch, who is going for his third Food City 500 win in a row and sixth overall, Chase Elliott, Kyle Larson, 2019 Night Race winner Denny Hamlin, Ryan Blaney, Clint Bowyer, Kurt Busch and two-time Food City 500 winner Jimmie Johnson, among others, are sure to be in the mix fighting for victory as the laps dwindle down on Sunday, April 5th.      In addition to cheering on their favorite drivers this weekend, Bristol Motor Speedway fans will definitely want to take advantage of so many activities to make a complete weekend of family fun. There will be great video entertainment provided by Colossus TV, the world’s largest outdoor center-hung video screen, premium VIP experiences like the Chairman’s Experience, tailgating, a visit to the Kids Zone, on-site camping, concerts, a college area, great food and beverages, and so much more.      Bristol Motor Speedway officials are making it easier than ever for families to enjoy the weekend. Kids’ tickets (12 and under) and adult tickets are free for Fun Friday, where race teams in all three featured racing series will hit the high banks to make critical practice laps. On Saturday, fans will be treated to Bush’s Beans Qualifying for both Cup and Xfinity Series and an amazing racing double-header featuring the Cheddar’s 300 presented by Alsco NASCAR Xfinity Series race and the ARCA Menards Series East Zombie Auto 150 race. Saturday’s tickets for adults start at $30 and are free for kids 12 and under. On Sunday, adult tickets start at $48 for the Food City 500 NASCAR Cup Series race through the special Jimmie Johnson ticket package that includes a Q&A with the seven-time champ and kids’ tickets start at $10. For all races, each child must have a physical ticket in hand to enter the gates. The Bristol Motor Speedway ticket office is the only authorized location that can produce the free kids’ tickets. Teens aged 13-19 are also eligible for half-priced tickets.      Fans can also grab Food City 500 tickets at their neighborhood Food City while supplies last and in doing so can add an extra 500 points to their Food City ValuCards.

As instructed by the Governor of Jakarta Anies Baswedan - and in consultation together with Formula E, the FIA, Ikatan Motor Indonesia (IMI) and the Organising Committee of the Jakarta E-Prix (OC) - it will no longer be possible to race in Jakarta on the scheduled date of June 6, 2020. Due to the outbreak of COVID-19 and the escalating number of cases in Indonesia and Jakarta, the decision has been taken as the most responsible course of action, to protect the health and safety of championship participants, staff and spectators. "With the growing number of COVID-19 cases in countries where Formula E currently has events scheduled to be held, we are evaluating contingency plans to lessen the potential impact of coronavirus and maintain the highest possible number of races on the calendar for season six," added Alberto Longo of Formula E. "It is a fluid situation, developing on a daily basis and we remain realistic and flexible in our approach to alternative options, which will be communicated in due course.

I entirely agree with Ms. Stelloh-Garner's letter of Feb. 19 commenting on your earlier editorial about your correspondence column. Surely letters to a local or regional paper should very largely be considered for publication in light of their relevance to the news or issues covered in that paper - one thing that we are NOT suffering from in this country is a lack of national news media, and/or opinions on national issues.
 It's unfortunately apparent from even a small sampling of local papers that with today's technology it's all too easy to send the same letter to dozens - hundreds? - of papers across the country, which by definition are not "local" at all to the sender. That being so, what is their attraction? Why, for example, should we need, let alone heed, more simplistic comments on national politicians all the way from San Diego? (letter, Feb. 28).
 Your editorials are invariably informative, well-written, moderate, judicious, supportive of the community, and highly relevant to state and local issues. So it's really a pity that the contrast between your leaders and some of the screeds that appear directly beneath them can be so jarring and incongruous. Does this have to be? It's a little hard to believe that your choice of what to print could be so limited; so why should parts of the correspondence page at times read merely like an extension of those sections of social media in which strange ideological bees buzz so noisily in so many bonnets?

Airline stocks have been among the hardest hit during the current market slump, but they soared Tuesday. American, which lost half its value since mid- February, jumped more than 15% — its best day since a 2013 merger with US Airways. United gained more than 12%. Delta and Southwest, which had fallen less, closed up 4.5%.
 The International Air Transport Association, an airline trade group, estimates that the outbreak could reduce carriers’ revenue by between $63 billion and $113 billion depending on how far and deep it spreads. The same group said the terror attacks in 2001, which devastated the U.S. airline industry but had less impact overseas, cut revenue by about $20 billion.
 The outlook for European airlines is bleaker than their U.S. rivals. Discount carrier Norwegian Air said Tuesday it would cut 15% of its flights through mid-June and lay off a “significant share” of its workers. It called the unspecified number of job cuts temporary. Air France-KLM said it has canceled 3,600 flights this month.
 Those moves come on top of announcements that Germany’s Lufthansa will cut up to half its flights after a “drastic” drop in bookings, and Finland’s national carrier, Finnair, will furlough workers for up to a month and cancel 1,400 flights.
 The demand drop-off that began in Asia picked up steam in the U.S. about two weeks ago, when the virus spread outside Asia, notably to Italy.
 Delta’s Hauenstein said demand has fallen more sharply on the West Coast — Washington state and California have suffered larger outbreaks — than on the East Coast. He said younger people have been more willing to keep flying; people over 55 less willing.
 The virus appears to be most dangerous among older people. The Associated Press reported over the weekend that the White House overruled a plan by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to recommend that older and physically weak Americans be advised not to fly on commercial airlines because of the new virus, according to a federal official. Instead, the CDC issued more nuanced advice, saying older people and those with health problems should avoid cruise ships, crowded places and “non-essential travel such as long plane trips.”
 American Airlines CEO Doug Parker said the largest decline has been in tickets within seven days of departure, which he said was entirely due to corporations restricting travel by employees. He predicted that business travel will return, but he didn’t say when.
 Airlines have been waiving change fees and touting stepped-up cleaning of airplane cabins to make passengers feel more comfortable about flying.
 They have also cut prices, although that has not stemmed the drop in demand. Hopper, a travel-data research firm, said the average domestic airfare fell 14% last week, with fare-sale discounts running more than 50% on some major routes such as New York-Chicago and Los Angeles-Washington.
 Delta, United, American and most international carriers have suspended flights to China and reduced flights elsewhere in Asia.
 U.S. airline officials say they can manage their way through the outbreak. They say their companies are stronger, more profitable and carrying less debt than in the past. Mergers have left fewer competitors. Lower oil prices will help — American expects to spend $3 billion less on fuel.
 The airlines, however, are facing a challenge unlike any they have seen before.
 “This current crisis is a test of the ability of our restructured industry to withstand the types of shock that we have never been able to withstand before,” American’s Parker said.

Technical chart claims that Sientra, Inc. (SIEN) would settle between $3.29/share to $3.55/share level. However, if the stock price goes below the $2.89 mark, then the market for Sientra, Inc. becomes much weaker. If that happens, the stock price might even plunge as low as $2.75 for its downside target. The stock is currently in the red zone of MACD, with the indicator reading -0.67. Traders are always alerted for the move of a stock above or below the zero line due to the fact that the reading is an indicator of the position of the short-term average relative to the long-term average. If the MACD is above the zero line, then the short-term average relative is above that of the long-term average, thus implying an upward momentum. Vice versa is the case if the MACD is below the zero line.

Boating disasters can happen at any time without warning. For example, on March 6, 1987, the MS Herald of Free Enterprise capsized in shallow water, killing 193 passengers. This ferry disaster was caused by negligence when someone left the bow-door open. As soon as the boat left the dock, water flooded the decks and the boat was on its side within minutes. This accident led to the creation of the Marine Accident Investigation Board (MAIB) in 1989.

To dig deeper, Jørgensen and his colleagues launched a sweeping analysis of drug companies’ vast study reports on the vaccine, which are largely kept confidential. And while they found much to criticize, their study ultimately revealed no solid evidence of serious side effects either. So what does this mean for people considering the HPV vaccine? Jørgensen’s advice to parents is to continue to follow the recommendations from health authorities. In turn, he hopes those agencies will take stock of his research and use it to continue to bolster testing for new medicines, particularly those that will be used widely and prophylactically like the HPV vaccine (his full dissertation is available here).

Hey, Thomas, thanks for the question. With regard to your question on recovery, I would say that it is too early yet to assess the full impact of the coronavirus outbreak. During this period, our priorities are still with our users, merchants and ecosystem partners. So as discussed, we plan to continue subsidizing the SME merchants on our platform, and to focus on improving the user experience. As we noted, we believe the investments today and by standing behind our users will accrue value for the shareholders in the long run. That said, I will note that as we launched at the end of February, a three-day campaign on RMB10 billion subsidy shopping festival on the theme of people returning to work, we have sensed a recovery on consumer demand. So, during the first half-hours of that campaign, we sold over 50,000 iPhones on our platform and 20,000 MAC lipsticks. That give us confidence that the longer-term demand for the industry remains unchanged.
