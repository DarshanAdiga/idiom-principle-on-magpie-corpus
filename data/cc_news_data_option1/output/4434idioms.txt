One candidate is looking to make a difference after losing his job last year. The other candidate feels there is unfinished business.
   
 Voters will decide Tuesday on who will represent them for the next four years as state senator from the 40th district, Democratic challenger Larry Dreiling or Republican incumbent Rick Billinger.
   
 Dreiling, 62, is from Hays and last year was laid off after 30 years as a journalist covering agricultural issues for the High Plains Journal. Billinger, 68, is a Goodland farmer who won his first term as state senator in 2016. Previously, he served two terms in the Kansas House of Representatives.
   
 Dreiling, after a 40-year career in journalism, was mulling over what to do next last spring, keeping in mind he was caring for his father, who turns 100 next week.
   
 "I wanted to do something locally, that still would be something meaningful and important," Dreiling said.
   
 Billinger said tending to his crops has limited his time campaigning, and the COVID-19 pandemic also has played a role.
   
 "I've been pretty much tied up trying to do fall harvest," Billinger said, adding he mostly has yard signs up. "It's just pretty tough. Some folks are reluctant to get too close to people."
   
 The 40th district includes Ellis County and the northwest corner of the state.
   
 "There are two different kinds of things in the district," Dreiling said. "There's the Hays area, and then there's the remote areas of the state.
   
 "You can't satisfy everybody, but you can find as good of middle ground as you can," he added. "That's the point of this campaign. Part of being a Kansas senator is trying to find that middle ground."
   
 One issue that could come up in the next session of the Legislature is Medicaid expansion.
   
 "We have to have Medicaid expansion," Dreiling said. "It's not what we should be doing, is turning down free money. It's a loss in revenue for the counties. That's money that can be used by the hospital."
   
 Medicaid expansion, which would have 90% federal funding and 10% from the state, has failed previously in the Legislature. The Kansas Hospital Association's website shows that the state has lost more than $4 billion in potential funding since 2014. It has been estimated that 130,000 uninsured Kansans would benefit.
   
 "I've supported Medicaid expansion," said Billinger, who voted for the bill in 2017, which was vetoed by Gov. Sam Brownback.
   
 However, Billinger said several questions need to be answered for any Medicaid expansion legislation, which did not advance in the Senate after losing procedural votes in 2019 and 2020.
   
 "Until you see a bill, it's hard to sit here and say we can do this or do that," said Billinger, who added among things lawmakers need to know is the cost for the state, whether there is a work requirement or a pathway to work, and should there be premiums based on income.
   
 "The more you ask, the more questions there are," Billinger said. "What will be in the bill?"
   
 Dreiling, who subscribed to newspapers in the district to keep informed, has noticed an increase in obituaries recently as coronavirus cases continue to mount.
   
 "When a little town needs two pages of obituaries, that tells you something," he said.
   
 To help curb the rise of COVID-19 infections, Dreiling favors a state-wide mask mandate with counties not being allowed to opt out.
   
 "I am a person who believes in science, first of all, and the science says we need a mandate, because people aren't going to do it on their own," he said. "I'd rather live with a mask for a while than die."
   
 Billinger favors local control when it comes to face coverings.
   
 "I support now, as I always have, local government having the autonomy over the decisions of their communities," he said. "Local decisions are best made closest to the people. I also support those local leaders having the best access to accurate information and any resources they may need to make the best decisions and protect their communities."
   
 Billinger pointed to a couple items on his agenda for the next session, if he is re-elected.
   
 "There are things I really want to see us get done," he said. "When I ran four years ago, I committed to running for two terms."
   
 Billinger said addressing the expected shortfall in revenue is a budget priority. He also believes adjustments need to be made on property tax.
   
 "The tax lid clearly has not worked, it's made it worse," Billinger said. "I don't go anywhere where property tax doesn't come up."
   
 The printed ballot has come up as an issue in Ellis County. About 3,800 incorrect ballots were sent out to voters who requested to vote by mail. The Senate 40th district race was affected and the remedy included the printing of new ballots and the extension of early voting hours. The incorrect early ballots that have been returned will still be counted.
   
 "This is voters' rights," Dreiling said. "We don't know if it's incompetence or whether it's voter suppression, or both. I'm hoping we don't have any further problems."
   
 Billinger was unconcerned about the error.
   
 "It was an honest mistake," he said. "I don't think anybody tried to do anything."
   
 Billinger said voters know what they will get from him.
   
 "First and foremost, I'm honest, have integrity and well-respected on both sides of the aisle in Topeka," he said. "I get things done."
   
 Dreiling said voters deserve honesty and fairness in their elected officials, and a senator who recognizes the different constituencies in the state.
   
 "We have to have somebody who can work with these urban legislators; it's not just a Republican and Democrat fight, it's going to be a rural and urban fight," Dreiling said. "We have to have somebody who can work together, cross those bridges of urban and rural, Republican and Democrat, and try to do the right thing for our very big corner of northwest Kansas."

Known to lead snake dances at his rallies, Cyclone’s 1952 gubernatorial campaign literature featured a photograph of himself dressed as Saint Nick with the slogan, “Nobody Snubs Santa Claus.” The text described him as “an able and interesting Editor, Lecturer, Poet, Cowboy, Author, Athlete, Actor, Organizer, Politico, Builder, and Banker.” When the optimistic multi-tasker fell ill in 1954, hospital switchboards were jammed with concerned callers. Earlier that same year, Cyclone had proclaimed: “The National Thinker’s Council, 530,000 Friends of the Aged Councils, the Texas Pension Association, the American Brush Club, and some few boneheads have filed their 73 year-old champion protagonist of Tom Paine’s Rights of Man for governor of gullible, galloping Texas. Cyclone Davis, the bewhiskered sage of Sulphur Springs, for twenty years a resident of Dallas, and perpetually importuned for forty years to run for public office, dollar-drafted by every state in the nation, three foreign countries, and the District of Columbia, has of recent years responded to that appeal by running for almost every office under the sun.”

If you order food from your car, you might expect only a certain quality of taste and presentation. But the Chef Lamona food truck is trying to change that expectation by offering "fine dining in a truck," according to owner Lamona Scroggins.


   


  Not only does Scroggins love to cook, she hopes to express love through her cooking. She believes that is her way of blessing her friends and family, and she wants to bless the entire Topeka community through her new business, which serves her "gourmet comfort food," she said.


   


  After watching both her parents take great pride in their own cooking, Scroggins started developing her own style in the kitchen at age 18. She honed her skills as a personal chef, cooking gourmet meals for personal parties and events.


   


  "I've always loved the art of cooking," Scroggins said. "I never really wanted to own a truck or a restaurant. I just loved cooking for people. So it made sense being a personal chef. But that's a luxury that not everyone can afford."


   


  News of her cooking spread by word of mouth, which prompted interest in offering her food to the public. But Scroggins was hesitant to make the leap. Finally, persuaded by the prodding of her family and friends, Scroggins joined forces with business partner Nicole Malone, and "fine dining in a truck" became a reality on Sept. 26.


   


  Scroggins and Malone had no desire to cram common food into a paper bag. They were committed as much to the style and presentation of the food as they were the taste. That meant they would have to oversee every detail and cast their vision to every employee. For that reason, the food truck has opened on a limited scale at first. For the time being, it is only open for business on Wednesdays and Saturdays for lunch and dinner.


   


  "I want it to taste and look a certain way," Scroggins said. "I want it to have that same quality that I put into when I was a personal chef.


   


  "I've never done business like this. You need a lot of staff. So we picked our days strategically at first."


   


  Scroggins demands the same standard of quality every day, but don't expect the same items on the menu. She said she plans to change the offerings every couple of weeks to keep things fresh.


   


  That's just who I am," Scroggins said. "When I switch the menu up, no one complains. I think they like that. I'm just being me. I try to structure the menu as if you were eating in my home."


   


  Items you might find on the menu include gumbo and beignets, or ham and beans with corn bread, or oxtail soup, or any other of a countless number of offerings she dreams up.


   


  "I have already been getting requests to bring back things that we've taken off the menu," Scroggins said.


   


  The Chef Lamona food truck developed a drive-thru process that enables customers to order and pick up their food without exiting their vehicles. Scroggins said she hopes that feature will be increasingly popular in cold weather. She said the business will try various locations, but the primary spot will be the parking lot of Harbor Freight Tools, 230 S.E. 29th St., due to the ample space it provides.


   


  Scroggins said working in a truck requires that she economize the space. She doesn't rule out opening a traditional restaurant someday. But for now, she said, she and Malone are dedicated to the food truck venture.


   


  "The challenges of working out of a food truck are that you need certain things to make it work," Scroggins said. "I like the truck experience over having to keep up a building. You never know where this might lead eventually, but right now I just like the feel of what we're doing.


   


  "I'm doing this for the satisfaction of people enjoying the quality of my food, the love I put into my food. Money is nice, but I had a good job before this. I'm getting a different kind of satisfaction out of doing this."

And I think for us, that was one of the takeaways of, you know, looking back at this period, this remarkable period in 1989 to 1991, when things could have turned out very differently and so struggling and competing internally over what to do about it. There was enormous pressure from conservatives in their own party in the Pentagon to take a much more skeptical and hawkish view of Mikhail Gorbachev and the reforms that he was undertaking in the Soviet Union. There was a lot of pressure on them in terms of the politics. There was also, by the way, very skeptical allies. The British and the French had fought two world wars against Germany. They were not enthusiastic, to say the least, about the prospect of German reunification. And then, of course, there were the Soviets. So it really was a moment when diplomacy mattered in a very tangible, concrete way. And had there been different people than Baker and Bush in those positions of power, it actually might have turned out differently.

One of Topeka's newest food ventures is shrouded in secrecy.


   


  Ghost Peppers, a delivery-only food service that begins its operations Nov. 2, won't only bring unique flavor combinations to Topeka but will be the city's first ghost kitchen.


   


  Ordering food from Ghost Peppers is available by visiting ghostpepperstopeka.com.


   


  According to Pedro Concepcion, founder of Kit Solutions Group and creator of Ghost Peppers, the ghost restaurant will serve fajitas, but not in a traditional sense.


   


  "It's kind of a combination of Hispanic with American," Concepcion said. "When you see regular fajitas in a Mexican restaurant, it's a bunch of peppers with meat. We are kind of doing it the same way, but our meats are smoked and then you can have a combination of brisket, burnt ends, pulled pork."


   


  Customers will also have the option to add peppers, corn and homemade sauces.


   


  While this will be Topeka's first ghost kitchen, the concept isn't new. In fact, it is a model that has been growing in popularity in recent years, with such chain restaurants as Chili's jumping on board with its "It's Just Wings" ghost restaurant.


   


  But what kicked the concept into high gear was the COVID-19 pandemic. Restaurants throughout the country closed their dining rooms, making it difficult for them to remain open, and subsequently, many restaurants closed their doors permanently.


   


  Because a ghost kitchen is delivery-only, restaurants that adapt to the model can remain open and bring in a steady stream of revenue.


   


  While the economic struggles brought on by the global pandemic won't last forever, there is a good chance ghost kitchens will.


   


  According to restaurantbusinessonline.com and Technomic, "sales via ghost restaurants from 300 facilities in the United States will rise by a projected 25% each year for the next 5 years -- an estimated $300 million in yearly sales. For this reason, operators would likely benefit by investing in the ghost kitchen model long-term."


   


  Not only do ghost kitchens operate as a delivery-only service, the kitchen where they prepare their food typically remains a mystery to the customer.


   


  Only those privy to Ghost Peppers' creation, such as Pedro and Javier Concepcion, know the location of where the menu items will be created.


   


  But rest assured, Concepcion says, it is coming from a reputable kitchen in Topeka.


   


  "It's already established, it's already licensed, so there's no worry that it's coming out of my garage," Concepcion said.


   


  One of the reasons the location of ghost kitchens remains a secret is to allow restaurants to experiment with new concepts without tarnishing their identity.


   


  The idea behind a ghost kitchen is to not only bring a new restaurant model to a city, but also to assist restaurants that might be struggling to bring in revenue.


   


  "Right now, restaurants are not seeing the volume they were seeing before, so it kind of has a trickle effect," Concepcion said. "When a restaurant doesn't have sales, it cuts its staff. So some restaurants right now are trying to figure out how to keep their staff still working."


   


  A ghost kitchen allows a restaurant to create a second, delivery-only menu within their kitchen. In order for a ghost kitchen to be successful, using products and resources they already have is vital.


   


  For example, Concepcion said, he wouldn't recommend that a vegetarian restaurant open a pizza ghost kitchen.


   


  "To make it logistically sound, I would recommend to look at their own resources and what they have," Concepcion said. "The way we are building them is you have to use your resources for them so it doesn't cost them so much money. A lot of people will tell you, 'Another menu, more money, more items you have to carry' -- not necessarily. Not if you look at your pantry and your walk-in and say, 'I can grab this, grab that,' and create a completely different concept that looks so different than what you have right now."


   


  And if a restaurant's ghost kitchen concept fails, it isn't a huge loss, Concepcion said.


   


  "All they have to do is turn off the website, turn off the Facebook," Concepcion said. "All their product is still there, all the labor they use they were already using so it doesn't really hurt them. It's just to give more options and honestly, find a way for them to stay afloat."


   


  If the concept ends up being successful in Topeka, Concepcion said, he hopes to incorporate several more ghost kitchens in established restaurants.


   


  While no other concepts have been set in stone, Concepcion is throwing around the idea of a ramen ghost kitchen.


   


  Concepcion said he hopes Ghost Peppers allows Topekans to experience quality food delivered to their door.


   


  "There's this notion that your delivery food is going to suck," Concepcion said. "For the most part, most of these restaurants weren't built for delivery. If you have a burger place, it's kind of hard almost because by the time your fries get home, they are kind of soggy, the bun is kind of greasy and it is what it is. Same thing if you were doing tacos. It has to make sense. We are trying to do it right. We are trying to think of the delivery aspect of it to the food presentation to how it tastes."

This is crafty characterization on Robinson's part. To create a white character able to reflect on his ability to do racial or racist harm in Jim Crow society is a tall order. Compounding the difficulty is the sky-high risk of presenting Della as implausibly perfect or innocent, a naïf for whom Jack is paternalistically responsible. Certainly, Jack idealizes her; at one point, he describes her as "a woman so lovely in his thoughts that he was afraid of her." But smartly, Robinson complicates this dynamic with class differences significant enough to render paternalism difficult. Della is a high-school teacher, and a beloved daughter of "the most respectable family on this round earth." Jack, though educated, is self-exiled from his family, lives on Skid Row, and, at times, needs Della to feed him. He never confuses his particular responsibility for protecting her with a protector role writ large.

One of Topeka's newest food ventures is shrouded in secrecy.
   
 Ghost Peppers, a delivery-only food service that begins its operations Nov. 2, won't only bring unique flavor combinations to Topeka but will be the city's first ghost kitchen.
   
 Ordering food from Ghost Peppers is available by visiting ghostpepperstopeka.com.
   
 According to Pedro Concepcion, founder of Kit Solutions Group and creator of Ghost Peppers, the ghost restaurant will serve fajitas, but not in a traditional sense.
   
 "It's kind of a combination of Hispanic with American," Concepcion said. "When you see regular fajitas in a Mexican restaurant, it's a bunch of peppers with meat. We are kind of doing it the same way, but our meats are smoked and then you can have a combination of brisket, burnt ends, pulled pork."
   
 Customers will also have the option to add peppers, corn and homemade sauces.
   
 While this will be Topeka's first ghost kitchen, the concept isn't new. In fact, it is a model that has been growing in popularity in recent years, with such chain restaurants as Chili's jumping on board with its "It's Just Wings" ghost restaurant.
   
 But what kicked the concept into high gear was the COVID-19 pandemic. Restaurants throughout the country closed their dining rooms, making it difficult for them to remain open, and subsequently, many restaurants closed their doors permanently.
   
 Because a ghost kitchen is delivery-only, restaurants that adapt to the model can remain open and bring in a steady stream of revenue.
   
 While the economic struggles brought on by the global pandemic won't last forever, there is a good chance ghost kitchens will.
   
 According to restaurantbusinessonline.com and Technomic, "sales via ghost restaurants from 300 facilities in the United States will rise by a projected 25% each year for the next 5 years -- an estimated $300 million in yearly sales. For this reason, operators would likely benefit by investing in the ghost kitchen model long-term."
   
 Not only do ghost kitchens operate as a delivery-only service, the kitchen where they prepare their food typically remains a mystery to the customer.
   
 Only those privy to Ghost Peppers' creation, such as Pedro and Javier Concepcion, know the location of where the menu items will be created.
   
 But rest assured, Concepcion says, it is coming from a reputable kitchen in Topeka.
   
 "It's already established, it's already licensed, so there's no worry that it's coming out of my garage," Concepcion said.
   
 One of the reasons the location of ghost kitchens remains a secret is to allow restaurants to experiment with new concepts without tarnishing their identity.
   
 The idea behind a ghost kitchen is to not only bring a new restaurant model to a city, but also to assist restaurants that might be struggling to bring in revenue.

Vermin Supreme will probably not be elected president this year. It might have been interesting, had he been allowed to take the debate stage with Biden and Trump, to hear his strategy for combatting the pandemic. (It also would have been nice for every American to receive a free pony!) But Supreme brings to mind the great Texas outsider Cyclone Davis Jr. “How can I lose?” asked the septuagenarian and self-proclaimed “bewhiskered dervish” when announcing his candidacy for president in 1954. “I’m an international character. I’ve talked face to face with more people than any politician who ever lived. Besides that, I’m a freak of nature: I haven’t been sick — not even a headache — in over sixty years. People are bound to vote for a healthy politician.”

Andy Burnham has outlined changes that need to be made for the second lockdown to be a “proper reset moment”.
 The Mayor said leaders “owe it” to the people of Greater Manchester for what is about to come from Thursday - when the lockdown will be in place - to be as “effective and fair as it possibly can be”.
 “We need to give them some hope that there is light at the end of the tunnel for them to go through this pain for a purpose,” Mr Burnham said in a press conference on Sunday.
 He said there was a number of “gaps that need to be filled in” from what was said by the Prime Minister on Saturday night, who announced the month-long national lockdown.
 They include fixing NHS Test and Trace, financial support for previously excluded workers, and closing schools.
 “There needs to be a commitment not to repeat mistakes made earlier this year and to make this a proper reset moment,” he said.
 Mr Burnham called for work to begin tomorrow on the NHS Test and Trace to correct faults they are aware of.
 He said the way in which the system works with national call centres needed to be changed, adding: “It [Test and Trace] cannot group people who live within a house. So multiple calls are made to the same house - that's one explanation of why there is such a poor contact rate.”

_SG:_ The incentive structure in Washington today has just fundamentally been blown up from that moment. I think back to the really scorched earth campaign of 1988. George W. Bush comes from behind, 17 points behind, beats Michael Dukakis in a ruthless campaign that Jim Baker oversaw, you know — the attacks on him for the Pledge of Allegiance, for the Willie Horton ad. And yet, what's the first thing that Baker does when he is becoming secretary of state after that victory? He sits down with Jim Wright, the Democratic speaker of the House, and cut a deal to end basically the decade-long internal fight that ripped Washington apart over U.S. funding for the contra wars. It nearly destroyed Ronald Reagan's presidency, the Iran-Contra scandal. It was the most divisive political issue, in terms of foreign policy, of the decade. And Baker immediately was able to make common cause and to see strategically that it was in his interest, Bush's interest, and the Democrats interests to move on from this.
