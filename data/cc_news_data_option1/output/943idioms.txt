Boris Johnson's reaction to the coronavirus outbreak has come under fire and Nigel Farage was attacking the response, especially surrounding airports and general transport.
 Ben, a student in Sian in China came on air to speak to Nigel about his experience of quarantine in China and how effective the Chinese government has been in maintaining the spread of coronavirus.
 Nigel asked the caller what he thought of the UK's response to coronavirus and his opinion on Boris Johnson's actions, to which he thought the action was terrible.
 Going back to China, he credited the effectiveness of quarantine, stating that in his city, which has a similar population to London "we haven't had any new cases in 15 or 16 days".

"How in the world are they supposed to know if it's adulterated or not? It's like asking someone to play Russian roulette. Hopefully they've made the right guess and they don't need the supports at those times."
 Ranger suggested providing more resources at supervised consumption services could help address some of the disorder that comes with increased meth use. Right now, the sites are too busy to accomplish that.
 "If somebody has consumed a bad batch of a stimulant like methamphetamines, it presents very much like an exaggerated anxiety or panic attack, and the way that you treat that is you provide a supportive environment. You speak to them in a calm manner. You do crowd control and you give them time and space."
 Ranger said most sites are set up to handle all methods of consumption except inhalation. Arches in Lethbridge is one of the few in Canada that has supervised inhalation rooms.
 "If anything, this report tells us that we haven't gone far enough. If we're able to offer safe places for people to inhale their drugs, then they're less likely to inject it and the risk for overdose and the risk for blood-borne pathogen injection goes down significantly."
 The panel also flagged discarded needles, feces and garbage as common complaints about consumption sites.
 Rebecca Saah, a community health expert at the University of Calgary, said people should consider what would happen to their communities if the sites were to disappear.
 "What are the impacts of seeing people who've overdosed in the community?" she asked.
 "If you don't support supervised consumption, you're supporting unsupervised consumption. And I do believe we'll see more people overdosing in public on the street, in agency bathrooms, in restaurant bathrooms, in businesses."

ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) — Francisco Rodríguez’s piñata business has seen better days. Casa de Piñatas, like other locally owned businesses along the Lead Avenue corridor near the University of New Mexico, is struggling to survive. “My best year was a long time ago. A long, long time ago,” said Rodríguez, a piñatero from Ciudad Juárez. “The last three years have killed me, but I try to survive.” Rodríguez has been at the same location for almost 25 years. A sign outside his window boasts 30 years of experience, but the 55-year-old told the Albuquerque Journal that he has made piñatas for nearly 50 years. Inside, the walls are lined with a rainbow of piñatas ranging from basketball-sized to some more than 3 feet tall. Some traditional designs such as a burro, star or flower hang from the ceiling and compete for attention against pop culture icons. Among them are some of Rodríguez’s original creations — a hot air balloon, a jet, a sprawling spider. Rodríguez learned to make piñatas by watching his father and his father’s workers. Back then, he would make them for fun, but at age 14, after emigrating with his family from Juárez to Albuquerque, he had to put his talent to work. “We had to work so we can eat, so we can pay the rent or pay the bills,” Rodríguez said. “Back in those days (my boss) used to pay me $1.25 per piñata — she sold them for $13.99.” Filled with candy and beaten until the treats fall out, piñatas are a staple at birthday parties and other celebrations in Mexican and Mexican American culture. Making a piñata can be as rewarding as the content inside. For Rodríguez, he likes the challenge of starting from scratch, blowing up balloons, laying papier-mâché over it, painting it and decorating it with...

Amazon is looking for a cure to the common cold. No, it’s not April Fools. The rumour turns out to be true. 'Project Gesundheit' (nice) is codename for a taskforce (read: team of employees) to research and develop ideas that could be a cure for the common cold. Sounds crazy, right? Perhaps not so much. The team is under Amazon's Grand Challenge group - think Moonshots ala Google - run by Babak Parviz (who used to run Alphabet’s research and development efforts). How far off are they from finding a cure? Pretty far. There are too many strains and factors to consider but is the task impossible? Not by a long shot and a vaccine is more likely. Health is an important arena for Amazon as it continues to flex and trial different things in order to decide the foothold to take. Amazon aren't alone in this search either. Biohub (Facebook/Chan Foundation), Stanford and the University of California researchers are also looking in this area. CNBC has more.

ATLANTA (AP) — Some faculty members are expressing concerns about a plan to change course requirements within the University System of Georgia. The system plans to cut the number of required core credit hours while adding required courses meant to improve critical thinking, digital fluency and oral communication, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. That will prepare students better for the workforce, officials said. But faculty members worry there will be less time devoted to subjects such as math, science and history. “There is still science, humanities, composition, math, social science, and history, but across the board, less of it,” said Augusta University history department chair Andrew Goss. “This plan will not make our graduates more workforce ready, and USG undergraduates will have less preparation, be less well rounded, and be less competitive in their careers,” he said. The plan would cut the number of required core credit hours from 42 to 33. The system’s chief academic officer, Tristan Denley, said he’s aware of the concerns, and faculty suggestions are being reviewed. Denley discussed the proposed changes during a recent presentation to the Georgia House of Representatives Higher Education Committee. Denley said he believes in the key elements of the changes. The core curriculum hasn’t significantly changed in about a decade, he said. “We really want a structure that prepares them for the rest of their lives,” he told lawmakers on the committee. He said current core requirements don't provoke enough critical thinking. System officials are planning to make a presentation on the proposed changes at a state Board of Regents meeting in April.

The government of Saudi Arabia announced on Sunday that it was cordoning off an entire region in the country's east over coronavirus fears. The Qatif region, home to the country's Shiite minority and seen as a hotbed of unrest, has recorded 11 cases of the novel COVID-19 virus.
  "Given that all 11 recorded positive cases of the new coronavirus are from Qatif... it has been decided... to temporarily suspend entry and exit from Qatif," the Interior Ministry in Riyadh said in a statement to the official Saudi Press Agency.
 As of Sunday, there were 234 confirmed cases of the virus in Saudi Arabia, many believed to have been brought into the country from hard-hit neighbor Iran, with many pilgrims having recently returned from the Shiite-majority nation.
 Qatif has been home to sporadic unrest since 2011, when protestors demanded more freedoms from the Saudi royal family in the midst of the Arab Spring.
 Protestors once again took to the streets in response to the lockdown, accusing the Sunni-dominated government in Riyadh of discrimination.
 Saudi Arabia has already closed off holy sites in Mecca and Medina in response to the outbreak. It is unclear yet if the coronavirus epidemic will affect the annual Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca, a holy journey for Muslims and a major source of revenue for the kingdom.
 The Formula 1 Grand Prix scheduled to take place in the county from March 20-22 will be held without spectators, the government has said.
 A slump in oil prices due to the virus is hitting the Saudi economy hard, particularly in light of major economic reforms sought by Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman.

My parents raised six children and endured for decades seemingly endless whining about the depravity and abuse of giving up pop or candy. As bad as the cacophonous wailing was about no Snickers candy bars, it was truly nothing compared to the reaction to meat-less Friday meals.
 Catholics after the Vatican II conference were allowed to eat meat on Fridays, except during Lent. While this was a tremendous boon to meat lovers, fish haters found yet another reason to be miserable during Lent.
 My mother, rest her soul, did her best to keep us happy and follow doctrine. It was far from easy on both fronts, but we children knew that mom would always err on the side of the church. No one was soiling their soul because they wanted meat Friday, not on her watch.
 So, we had fish sticks. Lots of fish sticks. To mix it up we had what I liked to call “rich people’s breakfast” for dinner — pancakes and eggs. Lots of macaroni and cheese as well. I was never a fan of fish but eating those awful fish sticks in the 1970s has scarred me for life. I can recall looking at Sizzlean, a faux bacon of the time, hoping beyond hope that it was meatless, only to learn it had pork.
 It was a sad realization.
