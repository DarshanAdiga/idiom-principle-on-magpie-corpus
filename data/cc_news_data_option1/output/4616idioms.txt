Tamara Grady had several reasons for wanting to run for a spot on the Osseo School Board. At the top of her long list was trying to make a difference for her children.
 Grady will now have that chance.
 The Northfield native, who has lived in Maple Grove for five years, was elected to the Osseo School Board in the General Election on Nov. 3. Grady was among the group of 11 candidates vying for three open positions on the Board.
 Grady garnered 12.8% of the vote (19,447) to earn her spot on the Board. In a very tight race, incumbents Heather Douglass and Jackie Mosqueda-Jones kept their spots on the Board. Douglass had 19,038 votes for 12.8%, and Mosqueda- Jones had 18,297 votes for 12.1%.
 Thomas Brooks won the special election for the spot vacated by Jessica Craig. Her four-year term starts in January.
 Narrowly missing out being elected was Miamon Queeglay, who had 10.5% of the vote (15,290). Current Board Chair Mike Ostaffe had 10.4% (15,804) and will not return to the Board.
 “I was sort of stunned, and I was so tired. I was like ‘Are those really my numbers?’ Grady said. “I’m looking at my kids and my family and they said ‘yes, those are your numbers.’ I was so focused on the campaign, so it was hard to tell
 “One of the things that was really tough about campaigning and COVID – social media was one of my better presences in the district, but you don’t get that level of feedback and engagement when you don’t have that in-person reaction, so in a lot of ways it was hard to tell how my message was getting out. A few thousand people can see our community conversations event, but only a few people comment.”
 READY TO COMMIT
 Grady moved from Minnesota to New York in high school. She met her eventual husband, Kevin, at Syracuse University. They moved to Oregon, where Grady earned her bachelor of science and master’s degree in anthropology.

Baylor looked like a potential Final Four team before the pandemic canceled the NCAA Tournament, and it could be in the mix again now that Butler is back after withdrawing from the NBA draft. The Bears were No. 2 in the AP preseason poll, highest in school history.
 “Jared has shown tremendous growth in his first two seasons at Baylor, both on and off the court,” Baylor coach Scott Drew said. “He has always been a great teammate with an infectious personality, and now that he’s an upperclassman, he’s taken on more of a leadership role.”
 Cunningham arrived in Stillwater with plenty of hype as the highest-rated recruit in school history. The athletic 6-8 guard can play the point or fill it up when he wants to, putting him at the top of numerous NBA draft boards for 2021.
 Cunningham dominated as a high schooler in Florida and is expected to have a similar impact in the Big 12 and beyond.

Adds early details from arguments on legal standing of plaintiffs)
 By Lawrence Hurley
 WASHINGTON, Nov 10 (Reuters) - The conservative-majority U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday began hearing arguments in a challenge by Republican-governed states backed by President Donald Trump's administration aiming to invalidate the Obamacare healthcare law.
 President-elect Joe Biden has criticized Republican efforts to throw out the Affordable Care Act (ACA), as the law is formally known, in the midst of a deadly coronavirus pandemic and hopes to buttress Obamacare after taking office on Jan. 20.
 The justices were hearing a scheduled 80 minutes of arguments by teleconference in an appeal by a coalition of Democratic-governed states including California and New York and the Democratic-led House of Representatives to preserve Obamacare.
 The arguments began with a discussion over whether the Republican plaintiffs have proper legal standing to bring the case. Chief Justice John Roberts and fellow conservative Justice Clarence Thomas both asked questions indicating that they think challengers likely have standing.
 The case represents the latest Republican legal attack on the 2010 law, which was the signature domestic policy achievement of Democratic former President Barack Obama, under whom Biden served as vice president. The Supreme Court in 2012 and 2015 fended off previous Republican challenges to it.
 The Supreme Court has a 6-3 conservative majority after the Republican-led Senate last month confirmed Trump's third appointee, Amy Coney Barrett. Most legal experts think the justices will stop short of a seismic ruling striking down Obamacare.
 A group of states led by Texas, later joined by Trump's administration, sued in 2018 in Texas to strike down the law.
 If Obamacare were to be struck down, up to 20 million Americans could lose medical insurance and insurers could once again refuse to cover people with pre-existing medical conditions. Obamacare expanded public healthcare programs and created marketplaces for private insurance.
 "We believe there are nine justices who connect the dots and see how important this is," said California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, a Democrat who is leading the coalition of 20 states defending Obamacare.
 "We think there's a very strong chance that Americans will continue to have good healthcare coverage," Becerra added.
 Texas-based U.S. District Court Judge Reed O'Connor in 2018 ruled that Obamacare was unconstitutional as currently structured in light of a Republican-backed change made by Congress a year earlier.
 The New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year partially upheld that ruling, saying the law's "individual mandate," which required people to obtain insurance or pay a financial penalty, afoul of the Constitution. But the 5th Circuit stopped short of striking down the law. The Democratic-led states and the House then appealed to the Supreme Court.
 The 2012 Supreme Court ruling upheld most Obamacare provisions including the individual mandate. The court defined this penalty as a tax and thus found the law permissible under the Constitution's provision empowering Congress to levy taxes.
 In 2017, Trump signed a law that eliminated the financial penalty under the individual mandate, which gave rise to the Republican lawsuit. With that change, the individual mandate could no longer be interpreted as a tax provision and was therefore unlawful, the Republican challengers argued.
 Thomas, addressing the question of legal standing, also asked whether people would be able to challenge a mandate requiring people to wear masks during the coronavirus pandemic even if there is no penalty for not wearing one.

With President-elect Joe Biden calling the pandemic "one of the most important battles our administration will face" as he unveiled a new COVID-19 advisory board Monday, the prospects for citizens getting better health information in this moment of crisis improved considerably. Biden promised to "follow the science" as he filled the panel with first-rate scientific and public health professionals.
 But Vice President Mike Pence also reconvened the controversial White House Coronavirus Task Force on Monday, which had not met for weeks. And if that panel stays true to form, it will deliver more misinformation and bad advice on a virus that has killed more than 238,000 Americans. And that would mean more confusion for citizens about everything from reopening schools to whether it is safe to get together with grandparents or grandchildren for Thanksgiving. Sadly, it will also mean more death as well.

Adds further arguments, comments from justices)


  By Lawrence Hurley and Andrew Chung


  WASHINGTON, Nov 10 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday grappled with whether all of Obamacare should be thrown out in a challenge by Republican-governed states, backed by President Donald Trump's administration, with two conservative justices suggesting the law should remain intact even if one provision is struck down.


  The justices were hearing a scheduled 80 minutes of arguments by teleconference in an appeal by a coalition of Democratic-governed states including California and New York and the Democratic-led House of Representatives to preserve Obamacare.


  President-elect Joe Biden has criticized Republican efforts to throw out the Affordable Care Act (ACA), as the law is formally known, in the midst of a deadly coronavirus pandemic and hopes to buttress Obamacare after taking office on Jan. 20.


  Chief Justice John Roberts and fellow conservative Brett Kavanaugh both asked questions that suggested they were skeptical of Republican arguments that all of Obamacare must fall even if one provision, known as the individual mandate, is found to be unconstitutional. That provision required people to obtain insurance or pay a financial penalty.


  "It's hard for you to argue that Congress intended the entire Act to fall if the mandate was struck down," Roberts said, noting that Congress did not repeal the entire law in 2017 when it eliminated the financial penalty under the individual mandate.


  Roberts and Kavanaugh appeared to agree that the mandate to buy insurance can be severed from the rest of the law.


  "We ask ourselves whether Congress would want the rest of the law to survive if an unconstitutional provision were severed," Roberts said, noting that Congress in 2017 chose to leave the rest of the law intact. "That seems to be compelling evidence," Roberts added.


  Texas and the other Republican-governed states, later joined by Trump's administration, sued in 2018 to strike down the law.


  Conservative justices indicated they think the Republican challengers had the proper legal standing to bring the legal challenge by describing similar scenarios in which someone might be able to file suit over a government mandate even if there is no penalty.


  Liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor questioned whether the Republican states had standing, saying their alleged injuries are not related to the individual mandate.


  The case represents the latest Republican legal attack on the 2010 law, which was the signature domestic policy achievement of Democratic former President Barack Obama, under whom Biden served as vice president. The Supreme Court in 2012 and 2015 fended off previous Republican challenges to it.


  The Supreme Court has a 6-3 conservative majority after the Republican-led Senate last month confirmed Trump's third appointee, Amy Coney Barrett. Most legal experts think the justices will stop short of a seismic ruling striking down Obamacare.


  If Obamacare were to be struck down, up to 20 million Americans could lose medical insurance and insurers could once again refuse to cover people with pre-existing medical conditions. Obamacare expanded public healthcare programs and created marketplaces for private insurance.

But the 5th Circuit stopped short of striking down the law. The Democratic-led states and the House then appealed to the Supreme Court.

  In 2017, Trump signed the measure that eliminated the financial penalty under the individual mandate, which gave rise to the Republican lawsuit. With that change, the individual mandate could no longer be interpreted as a tax provision and was therefore unlawful, the Republican challengers argued.


  Donald Verrelli, the lawyer representing the House, told the justices that the Republican challengers were "asking this court to do what Congress refused to do when it voted down repeal of the ACA in 2017. But their argument is untenable."


  "The Affordable Care Act has been the law of the land for 10 years," Verrelli added. "The healthcare sector has reshaped itself on reliance on the law. Tens of millions of Americans rely on it for health insurance that they previously could not afford and more rely on the law for its protections and benefits."


  Michael Mongan, California's solicitor general, told the justices that "what Congress did here was to create an inoperative provision. It doesn't require anybody to do anything."


  "Why the bait and switch?" Roberts asked Verrelli in relation to the Democratic arguments that losing the mandate would not scuttle the law, which is not what they argued in the Supreme Court's 2012 case. Then, Verrelli represented the Obama administration in defending Obamacare.


  Verrelli responded that Congress actually adopted a "carrot and stick" approach in adopting Obamacare and that "it turned out that the carrot worked without the stick."

The Medina City Council, Tuesday, Oct. 20, directed city staff to implement a $290,196 project that would stabilize a ravine that drains into the southwest end of Wolsfeld Lake. The goal is to prevent 46 pounds of phosphorus per year from flowing into the lake.
 Implementation of the project is contingent upon Medina receiving matching grant funds from the Minnesota Board of Soil and Water Resources (BWSR).
 At the meeting, the council also took up other business. Here are meeting highlights.
 WOLSFELD LAKE STUDY
 Becky Christopher, Policy Planning Manager for the Minnehaha Creek Watershed District, presented results of an assessment of the Long Lake Creek Subwatershed that includes five impaired lakes — Wolsfeld, Holy Name, Long, School and Tanager.
 The subwatershed is located in Medina, Long Lake and Orono. It stretches from School Lake in the northwest in Medina to Tanager Lake adjacent to Lake Minnetonka in the south. The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (PCA), using powers of the federal Clean Water Act, is requiring cities in the Long Lake Creek Subwatershed to clean up their impaired lakes by following a Total Maximum Daily Load Plan.
 Christopher said that the ability of cities and the watershed district to implement the TMDL Plan depends upon receiving grants. Four years ago, Medina, Long Lake and Orono formed a partnership, and the Long Lake Waters Association (LLWA) was established. The Minnehaha Creek Watershed District took on the technical/planning lead and spearheaded an assessment of the Long Lake Creek Subwatershed.
 The assessment identified and evaluated 54 potential projects, recommended 37 of them and ranked them on the basis of cost-effectiveness and feasibility. A top priority is stabilization of the Wolsfeld Lake ravine, owned by the Department of Natural Resources and located in the Wolsfeld Woods Scientific and Natural Area.
 Christopher said the subwatershed study has well positioned the five-member partnership for securing grants. BWSR already has awarded $232,000 in funds for the Wolsfeld ravine project. Most grants require a match of 10 – 25% in cash or in-kind contribution.
 related CITY COUNCIL ACTIONS
 Christopher asked for and got City Council approval of three requests.
 First, the council accepted the Long Lake Subwatershed Assessment and the road map for implementing the 37 recommended projects.

The major factor which are helping the market to grow high is rise of patients who prefer minimal invasive or noninvasive medical surgeries. The increase in number of population who are obese and diabetic are relying mostly on the bone growth stimulators for bone related trouble. The elderly population who tends to have to low bone density are more vulnerable to bone associated injuries. The slow natural healing process accompanied with techniques which are invasive makes them nod for the bone growth stimulation therapy. Moreover, the people aged 60 has grown significantly over the years in all over the region thus putting a press on the manufacturers to suffice the demand. The ever increasing public awareness about health in recent years is elevating the market like never before. One of the important factor that is favoring the growth of the market is the cost of the bone growth stimulation therapy. The cost is said to be bang for the buck in comparison to other invasive therapies. The market could offer product such as implantable and external devices. Bone growth stimulator can find its application into spinal fusion surgeries, dental surgeries, and union and delayed nonunion fractures. Hospitals, homecare settings, and specialty clinics can use the therapy. The market is found in region of North America, Asia-pacific, Europe and Latin America and Middle East and Africa.

In a phone interview from Les Sables-d’Olonne, France, the rough edge of the North Atlantic where the race starts, Attanasio likened the two of them racing to any working couple seeking a balance with the division of labor at home.
 “It’s like in traditional family fishing,” Attanasio said. "The husband goes fishing, and the wife sells the fish. The work goes well because the two work together, like when Sam is sailing, and I am with Ruben.''
 Said Davies, “For both of us, it’s our dream. We used to take turns, but as Ruben gets older, we are sharing a lot more of our experiences.”
 This took a lot more calibration.
 Davies and Attanasio arrived together in Les Sables-d’Olonne late Thursday after dropping Ruben off at school. Davies' parents are now taking care of her son, as they have each time the pair leaves for a race.
 This time, however, “there’s no one to help with the details,” Attanasio said. “Normally you can just grab your sea bag and head off to the race while the husband or wife takes care of everything, but one of us has to deal with the rental house.”
 Splitting up their training over the past two years, each taking turns being with their son while the other is at sea, is distinct in the hyperfocused world of solo sailing. Once working on each other’s campaign in the past, they are now competitors, but they are not competitive with each other, mostly because Davies is probably going to be a front-runner in her more modern sailboat.
 Her boat reaches 30 knots. Attanasio has a slower, older-generation boat that is competitive with about half the fleet, though mishaps and sea conditions can make for unlikely gains.

Christman’s baking talents will be on display for the nation on Monday, but you can see her intricately designed cookies anytime you’d like on Instagram at @sweetdough.cookieco where she promotes her business.
 Her company, which she founded three years ago while living in Pullman, Washington, started from humble beginnings — just Christman baking cookies in her kitchen at home.
 Christman landed in Centralia because her fianceé is local to the Twin Cities and the couple decided to move back to his hometown after he finished school at Washington State University.
 A native of Graham, Washington, Christman says her baking career started when she was a 12-year-old girl taking a trip to Celebrity Cake Studio in Tacoma with her mother. At that baking studio — one she would later go on to work for after graduating high school — Chistman had a revelation about her career as a baker.
 “My mom took me there one day and we just sat there for like an hour looking through all their look books, and I was like, ‘Oh my gosh, mom, I want to do this,’” Christman said.
 On the same day, Christman and her mother went out and purchased the baking equipment she needed to whip up her first ever cake. It wasn’t quite the cake that foreshadowed a baking prodigy in the making, but it was a start, Christman said humorously.
 “It was the ugliest thing that I’ve ever seen looking back,” Christman said with a smile. “But it just shows you practicing over and over really helps.”
 And practice she did. Christman reckoned that a lot of her freetime as an adolescent was spent in the kitchen fine-tuning her baking skills.
 High school football games? Sorry, Christman was too busy baking cakes. A weekend party? No dice, Christman had a batch of cookies coming out of the oven and they weren’t going to frost themselves.
 Christman was consumed by her art, and as she says, “it paid off.”
 On Monday, Christman plans on having a small viewing party with family members. And for the local baker who is making her debut in the national spotlight, it is poised to be an emotional evening.
 “I’m sure I am going to cry, I just can’t believe it,” Christman said.

McLeod told commissioners that although he requested five full-time employees (FTEs), three would also do the trick. Ultimately, commissioners agreed to fund 1.5 FTEs. With the help of funds from the prosecuting attorney’s office, the coroner will ultimately be able to elevate two employees to full-time status.
 Prosecuting Attorney Jonathan Meyer told commissioners that his office decided to commit approximately $50,000 to the coroner’s office, since many of the deaths they respond to also involve the prosecuting attorney’s office. The investment, he said, would be mutually beneficial.
 “We think it’s a very worthwhile, and obviously needed, function, especially when we look at the increase in controlled substance deaths,” Meyer said. “And by definition, nearly 100 percent of controlled substance deaths include a controlled substance homicide, so that creates additional work for us … I think it’s a good spend.”
 McLeod has pushed for the increase in months prior, describing how the “casual help” employees, who go through extensive certification and training, actually perform a substantial amount of work for the county, yet are capped at $15.50/hour, which only kicks in if they’re actively responding to a call.

 Schumacker noted. "But everybody, from what we can tell, was really pleased with how everything turned out. The way that animation works, it's interesting and also a little bit terrifying at times, because it's not like live-action where you're locking people with contracts for many years before they get cast in the show. It's just done on an episode by episode basis. It's just, 'Hey, are you available?' But, at the same time, the time commitment is so different than in live-action that oftentimes, unless it's a completely terrible experience for someone, they're generally pretty receptive to coming back. So no one has explicitly told us that they will not be returning to the show."

Adds comment from Iranian spokesman)
 By Humeyra Pamuk, Arshad Mohammed and Matt Spetalnick
 WASHINGTON, Nov 9 (Reuters) - The United States is expected to impose sanctions as early as next week on Iranians involved in a violent crackdown against anti-government demonstrations in Iran a year ago, three sources familiar with the matter said on Monday.
 The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the sanctions announcement was timed to the one-year anniversary of what may have been the bloodiest repression of protesters in Iran since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
 One source said next week's designations would be a major action, covering multiple individuals as well as several dozen Iranian entities.
 "If true, it will simply be indicative of the desperation of an administration whose hostility towards the people of Iran is well-known," said Alireza Miryousefi, spokesman for Iran's mission to the United Nations in New York, in an emailed statement.
 The State Department did not respond to a request for comment on the sanctions likely to be imposed next week.
 Citing three Iranian Interior Ministry officials, Reuters previously reported about 1,500 people were killed during less than two weeks of unrest that started on Nov. 15, 2019. The toll included at least 17 teenagers and about 400 women as well as members of the Iranian security forces and police.
 Iran's Interior Ministry has said around 225 people were killed during the protests, which erupted after state media announced that gas prices would rise by as much as 200% and the revenue would be used to help needy families.
 The sources, who included one U.S. official and two people familiar with the matter, said the sanctions have been in the works for months and are the latest in a long series of U.S. penalties imposed on Iran by U.S. President Donald Trump.
 Trump two years ago abandoned the 2015 Iran nuclear deal struck by his predecessor, Barack Obama, and has since restored harsh U.S. economic sanctions designed to force Tehran into a wider negotiation on curbing its nuclear program, development of ballistic missiles and support for regional proxy forces.
 One source said Washington would blacklist people involved in the killing of civilians, while a second source said those targeted would include government and security officials.
 Several sources played down a media report that the Trump administration planned a flood of sanctions before President-elect Joe Biden takes office on Jan. 20. Biden, who was Obama's vice president, defeated Trump in last week's U.S. election.
 Biden has said he would return to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, under which Tehran agreed to restrict its nuclear program in return for relief from U.S. and other sanctions, if the Iranian government resumes compliance.
 "We've been sanctioning Iranian entities nearly every week for the past six months. There's no reason we would put our foot on the brake now, but we're not pushing it down on the gas pedal any further either," a Trump administration official said on condition of anonymity.
 Two weeks ago, the U.S. Treasury slapped counterterrorism sanctions on key players in Iran's oil sector for supporting the Quds Force, the elite paramilitary arm of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.
 Analysts said that action, taken ahead of the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election, was among Trump administration moves seeking to make it harder to lift sanctions if Biden won the White House.

“The biggest thing is changing the culture of the board. “I think there was a clear mandate from the district that they want to see positive change on the board and see them work together to move the district forward,” Brooks said. “I know immediately we have the great challenge of ushering the district through the pandemic. Getting everyone through that is the immediate challenge. We to refocus and reprioritizing our kids in the district, particularly those who are struggling academically.
 “We need to work on improving the achievement gap and making sure our schools are safe and fair for all of our kids. There’s a lot that we need to do in the district. We’ve lost many families because of the pandemic to private schools, charter schools and home schools. We need to take a look at the standards that we’re setting for the kids and make sure we earn those kids and families back. There’s a long list of things that we need to accomplish over the next several years, but that’s what I signed up for.”
 COVID-19 AN ISSUE
 With positive cases of COVID-19 on a dramatic rise in recent weeks, Brooks said providing solutions and finding a balance between safety and academics is at the top of his list.
 The Osseo District started the school year two weeks later than usual and began with a hybrid learning model in all grades. That, however, shifted to distance learning for grades six to 12 and hybrid for elementary students on Nov. 8, as cases continued to spike.
 Superintendent Cory McIntyre warned at the beginning of the school year that these models will likely change frequently. Thus far, that has proven to be correct.
 Brooks said he follows the views of many on the COVID-19 learning models, stressing safety while wanting students, teachers and staff back in buildings when deemed safe.
 “At the end of the day, I want our students and educators to be safe,” Brooks said. “I want our kids back in school as quickly as possible and as much as possible, but only in an environment that makes sense. With kids in school full time, there are some limitations when it comes to social distancing and safety protocols. My belief on this is we need to follow science and leadership from the state, pay attention to our epidemiologist, our numbers in the district and make those decisions accordingly.
 “I know how a board should run and how it should function as a body. I want to create an environment where the board is responsive to our educators, students and our families.”

So needless to say, a cookie baking challenge was right in her sweet spot.
 Christman, who is an avid watcher of the Food Network to begin with, said she first applied to be on the show about two years ago — roughly six months after she had founded Sweet Dough Cookie Co. — but didn’t make it. Understandable, she felt, considering she hadn’t been a professional baker for very long.
 But then early in 2020, Christman got a phone call from an out-of-state area code number so she didn’t think much of it. When she went to check the voicemail, she realized she had been invited to be a participant on the show.
 “I jumped up and down all over my house, I was so excited,” Christman said.
 In August, Christman was flown down to New Orleans for a week where the show was taped. For obvious reasons, Christman couldn’t divulge into the details of how the taping went — you can find that out for yourself on Monday.
 However, when asked what her strongest trait as a baker is that would show up in the competition, Christman said her ability to decorate cookies quickly was her ace in the hole.
 The competition is broken into two timed rounds, the first round contestants are given 90 minutes and in the second they’re given 150 minutes, so working quickly is a critical aspect of the show.
 “I knew that I had to bake, decorate, flood everything in that amount of time and I felt like that helped me along the way, like just my speed as a cookie decorator, because I knew I could get the job done,” Christmas said.
 If Christman does win the competition, she says she will put the $10,000 back into Sweet Dough Cookie Co. and get a commercial kitchen space that would replace the one she and her family built in the back of her fianceé’s parents’ house.
 The quaint, makeshift commercial kitchen shares a roof with her father-in- law’s workshop and she is looking for her own space, should she win. Christman also threw around the idea of a storefront, though has no immediate plans to open one with the coronavirus pandemic still going on.

 One of Hutchinson's earliest settler's, R.B. Shadduck, moved here in 1885 and purchased a section of land on Hutch's west outskirts that included Cow Creek and a wide spot in the canal which became labeled as Shadduck Lake.
   
 In 1937, Hutch received a WPA grant to improve the lake and canal to the power plant. The canal was improved with cement bankings to make it nice for canoeing, swimming and fishing. The lake and canal conditions deteriorated over the years.
   
 In 1963, the city started plans to fill the lake and create a "Fine Park" on the property. The lake was filled but not much more than that happened.
   
 In 2005, the city constructed the Shadduck Park Community Center for recreation. The center today houses the Boys & Girls Club for Hutchinson at 600 W. 2nd Ave. and owned by the City of Hutch.

When the words Tita Gloria pop into my mind, the very first thing I think of is:   That is my 2nd MOM!      My mom loved Gloria from the very start and what grew from their relationship has impacted my family and I both genuinely and indefinitely.      If I could love anyone as close and deeply as I love my own mother, it is has always been and will always be, Tita Gloria.      Gloria lives as her namesake states. Gloriously.      I think we can all agree that Gloria is just one of those people who just has an undeniable presence and lives life with pure moxie.   She has an infectious smile paired with a fierce yet compassionate heart that is light, deep, and bold all in the same breath. Her love has always been unyielding.   It is simply impossible not to be affected deeply by her.   Her spirit is very much an inspiration to how I strive to carry my own life.      As an only child with two hard working parents, I was practically raised in tandem with the Flores family throughout my childhood and into my adult life.      From the start Gloria, Jess, Jesus, and Sarah immediately became my Tita, Tito, Kuya, and Ate as they not just welcomed me into their family, but always treated me as one of their own. I could not be more grateful for each of them.      The unity between these two moms and what became of it can never be eroded by time, distance, or passing on. It will always be permanent.      Tita Gloria’s spirit will remain glorious and our love for her will carry on eternally within us.      -Love Always    Mike, Emma, and Eddie.

Laurel Louise Glasco passed away the morning of November 10, 2020, with her husband of fifty years, Carroll Glasco, Jr., and children Jeremy Glasco, Sarah Glasco, Esther Glasco Loch, and Anna Glasco Erving all in Virginia to say goodbye. She was the only child of a single mom, and was born and grew up just outside San Francisco. In recent years, however, her obsession with ancestry.com paid off when she discovered that her biological father had other children. She suddenly had brothers and sisters, a whole blood family she never knew existed, and they embraced her with open arms. Meeting them and going out to Montana where they live just a few years ago with Carroll made her so very happy. Laurel was a professional musician, a gifted pianist, organist, violinist, and violist and played in the string quartet, I Quattro Amici as well as the Hampton Roads Philharmonic Orchestra. She was also a master gardener. Laurel was intellectual, opinionated, and a veritable know-it-all, as she read a whole book every single day. She had exquisite taste in cinema and literature, and she loved jewelry and her Temptations® bakeware. She loved her husband, her cats and birds, music, and her family more than anything.Laurel is survived by her husband, many members of her newfound Bulger family, four children, three honorary children in the exchange students from France, West Germany, and Sweden to whom she so generously opened her home in the 1980s, thirteen grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren. Laurel was an organ donor, so her memory and legacy will live on in those who receive her liver, kidneys, and lungs, and maybe the fortunate transplant recipients will get a pinch of her spunk and sass as well. Laurel was loved by so many, and she will be missed. Due to Covid-19 restrictions, services at her church will be private, and burial will take place in Peninsula Memorial Park. Arrangements are under the care of Peninsula Funeral Home, 11144 Warwick Blvd., Newport News, VA 23601.

As a rookie, Brown averaged 20.2 yards per catch, second in the NFL to Mike Williams. He benefited at times from Tennessee's strong play-action game, with Ryan Tannehill faking to Derrick Henry before finding Brown down the field. But Brown's powerful running with the ball in his hands also played well — his 204 yards after the catch as a rookie ranked top-30 in the NFL.
 Brown tailed off in the second half of 2019 after a blistering start, but in his second year, he's fallen back on some of the things that made him such a productive all-around receiver at Ole Miss. Rather than being a one-trick, big-play pony like in 2019, Brown has embraced being a possession receiver who moves the chains when the Titans need it. That role still allows him to break big plays when they're available.
 On Oct. 25 against the Steelers, Brown ran a slant route from the left flank, and Tannehill connected with him short of the sticks. Brown put on the afterburners and outran everyone down the right sideline for a 73-yard touchdown. At the time, his peak run speed tied for the fastest by a WR carrying the ball in the NFL in 2020. As it turned out, Brown too could be one of the NFL's top receivers by putting together immense athletic talent with real wide receiver skills. It's the latter that showed up more for Brown in college, while Metcalf was more of the former. But they both had the right combination all along.

 McGregor hailed from an area in Dublin, Ireland, known as Crumlin. He came from a working class family and had to initially work as a plumber to make ends meet. It is well known that McGregor received a welfare check of €188 just before his UFC debut against Marcus Brimage.
 Conor McGregor spectacularly knocked out Marcus Brimage on his debut dance inside the Octagon and famously said thereafter "Dana, 60 Geez baby!", hinting at the $60,000 he was about to receive that included a performance bonus.

There is a gap in 13 that he could take it up high and left and take it into an area that's beyond the trees and pushing the 14th fairway. It can be done. The same thing at eight. He's going to have to shoot that ball in there a little bit. And at five. If he misses left in the bunkers -- they're pretty much pitch-out bunkers. But if he can carry it up there, in these conditions, there are definitely advantages. We need to be reminded that it's still getting the ball in the hole.

Thomas Brooks has lived in Brooklyn Park for almost 10 years. When the events of 2020 started unfolding, he looked for an avenue for his voice to be heard.
 Brooks decided to apply for an open position on the Osseo School Board, and it initially was met with some skepticism from his family and friends. But, onward he pressed.
 The work involved dealing with a challenging campaign in incredibly challenging times. However, the work proved worthwhile for Brooks on election night as he was elected to the Board in a special election due to the resignation of Jessica Craig.
 The emotion of winning the post was not lost on Brooks, who has two children in the Osseo District.
 “It took a while to process,” Brooks said. “I worked incredibly hard on this. It started with just me and this idea to run. I had to convince everyone around me that this was a good idea and build a coalition, which I didn’t know that I could do. To see everything fall into place and see the numbers actually come in was a lot to process. It was an emotional evening, for sure.
 “With everything that’s happened this year, from the comments made by the school board member who had to step down, to all of the divisiveness surrounding George Floyd, it really felt like the right time for someone from a community of color to step up. I took that as an opportunity to apply. As a leader of color, I wanted to step up and bridge that divide and hopefully change the culture of the board for the better.”
 Five candidates applied for the special election. Brooks earned 31.6% of the vote (18,383) to beat runner-up Bridget Erickson, who had 27.8% (16,205). Kia Xiong was third in the voting with 17% (9,996), Vicki Richardson fourth with 13.2% (7,686), and Khai Vang fifth with 9.8% (5,697).
 Brooks grew up in Chicago and soon moved to Las Vegas, where he still has family. His position with U.S. Bank, where he is now a project manager, brought him to the Twin Cities from upstate New York. He will start his two- year term on Nov. 17.
 Brooks is a Black man, and his goals start with dealing with racial issues the district. His public service duties resume is extensive. He’s the Chair of the Minnesota Board of Social Work and also serves on the Brooklyn Park Human Rights Commission.
 “I’m coming to the board with years of board governance experience and a business background,” Brooks said. “I hope to bring that knowledge and experience to the board as we work to bridge some of this divisiveness that’s happening in our district, as we work to tackle some difficult topics such as achievement gap, racial disparities and systemic injustice.”
 His goals are wide-ranging, starting from working the relationship among Board members and also working together to helping students who are struggling academically.

It obviously did not go over well, and Brown tweeted Wednesday, "I apologize for the flippant reference I made to the Holocaust in my tweet last night. It was not a reference I made for humorous effect but rather to reflect how deeply frightened I am for our country. It was a very poor use of judgement and in poor taste." Some of Brown's other tweets from Tuesday night remain up, however, including a foul-mouthed response to a user who suggested he "take it easy" and a reply to another user noting, "I have no gold fillings."

The problems only got worse last week against the Chargers after Brown went back on the COVID-19 list and Miller missed the first game of his career with an ankle injury, forcing Parker to play left tackle.
 That all comes after the Raiders were forced to play a game against Tampa Bay last month after not having the entire starting offensive line at practice during the week when Brown tested positive for the coronavirus and four teammates missed three practices because of "high risk" close contacts.
 Through it all, Hudson has anchored the group at center with big contributions from Jackson and Good.
 "He's the leader of the group, no doubt," coach Jon Gruden said of Hudson. "He makes the guys next to him better. He holds the guys to a high standard the way we meet, the way we practice and the way we compete. It all starts with Rodney, he's having another great season.
 "It's good to see a healthy Gabe Jackson and Denzelle Good has really stepped up. Our interior three has played excellent football and we're hoping that our tackles can return healthy together someday soon, but in the meantime, you have to tip your hat Brandon Parker. He's played right tackle and left tackle in consecutive weeks and Sam Young has given us some critical snaps."
 The Raiders don't know when they'll get the entire line healthy, which it hasn't been since Brown left the opener after hurting his calf on the first drive.
 He's not expected to return any time soon from the COVID-19 list and Incognito hasn't even started practicing yet.
 "It's been tough," Gruden said. "We've had a lot of adversity. ... It's disappointing, but it's an opportunity to keep digging, keep grinding, keep developing and finding ways to win."

Adds further questions from justices, comments from lawyers representing Democrats)
 By Lawrence Hurley
 WASHINGTON, Nov 10 (Reuters) - The conservative-majority U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday heard arguments in a challenge by Republican-governed states including Texas, backed by President Donald Trump's administration, aiming to invalidate the Obamacare healthcare law.
 President-elect Joe Biden has criticized Republican efforts to throw out the Affordable Care Act (ACA), as the law is formally known, in the midst of a deadly coronavirus pandemic and hopes to buttress Obamacare after taking office on Jan. 20.
 The justices were hearing a scheduled 80 minutes of arguments by teleconference in an appeal by a coalition of Democratic-governed states including California and New York and the Democratic-led House of Representatives to preserve Obamacare.
 Conservative justices indicated they think the Republican challengers had the proper legal standing to bring the legal challenge by describing similar scenarios in which someone might be able to file suit over a government mandate even if there is no penalty. The arguments began with a discussion over legal standing, with questions by Chief Justice John Roberts and fellow conservative Clarence Thomas.
 Liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor questioned whether the Republican states had standing, saying their alleged injuries are not related to the individual mandate. "They should have brought that challenge" if they wanted to sue over other parts of the law, Sotomayor added.
 The case represents the latest Republican legal attack on the 2010 law, which was the signature domestic policy achievement of Democratic former President Barack Obama, under whom Biden served as vice president. The Supreme Court in 2012 and 2015 fended off previous Republican challenges to it.
 The Supreme Court has a 6-3 conservative majority after the Republican-led Senate last month confirmed Trump's third appointee, Amy Coney Barrett. Most legal experts think the justices will stop short of a seismic ruling striking down Obamacare.
 Texas and the other Republican-governed states, later joined by Trump's administration, sued in 2018 in Texas to strike down the law.
 If Obamacare were to be struck down, up to 20 million Americans could lose medical insurance and insurers could once again refuse to cover people with pre-existing medical conditions. Obamacare expanded public healthcare programs and created marketplaces for private insurance.
 "We think there's a very strong chance that Americans will continue to have good healthcare coverage," Becerra added.
 Texas-based U.S. District Court Judge Reed O'Connor in 2018 ruled that Obamacare was unconstitutional as currently structured in light of a Republican-backed change made by Congress a year earlier.
 The New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year partially upheld that ruling, saying the law's "individual mandate," which required people to obtain insurance or pay a financial penalty, afoul of the Constitution. But the 5th Circuit stopped short of striking down the law. The Democratic-led states and the House then appealed to the Supreme Court.
 The 2012 Supreme Court ruling upheld most Obamacare provisions including the individual mandate. The court defined this penalty as a tax and thus found the law permissible under the Constitution's provision empowering Congress to levy taxes.
 In 2017, Trump signed a law that eliminated the financial penalty under the individual mandate, which gave rise to the Republican lawsuit. With that change, the individual mandate could no longer be interpreted as a tax provision and was therefore unlawful, the Republican challengers argued.
 Donald Verrelli, the lawyer representing the House, told the justices that the Republican challengers were "asking this court to do what Congress refused to do when it voted down repeal of the ACA in 2017. But their argument is untenable."
 Michael Mongan, California's solicitor general, told the justices that "what Congress did here was to create an inoperative provision. It doesn't require anybody to do anything."
 "Why the bait and switch?" Roberts asked Verrilli in relation to the Democratic arguments that losing the mandate would not scuttle the law, which is not what they argued in the Supreme Court's 2012 case. Then, Verrilli represented the Obama administration in defending Obamacare.
 Verrilli responded that Congress actually adopted a "carrot and stick" approach in adopting Obamacare and that "it turned out that the carrot worked without the stick."
 Thomas, addressing the question of legal standing, also asked whether people would be able to challenge a mandate requiring people to wear masks during the coronavirus pandemic even if there is no penalty for not wearing one.
 Proposing another hypothetical situation, conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh wondered if people would have legal standing to sue if Congress required everyone to fly an American flag outside their house but did not impose a penalty for not doing it.

 "I'm 26, I'm only four years in but I feel like I'm on the verge of blossoming even more with more of a lead role and taking more responsibility in my game.
 "At the end of the day, it's not purely numbers but the numbers do play a big part. I just want to feel my value reciprocated from the other end.
 "Teams can tell you they value you all they want to, but until they show you with numbers, then you know what that means.
 "We'll see what that looks like. I'm not going to play hard to get, I'm not going to outsmart myself and stack teams against each other.
 "We'll see what the numbers look like when they come in and try to make the best decision. I'm a pretty simple guy, so it's not that difficult for me."
 VanVleet is going to be realistic, however, explaining: "I wasn't a lottery pick and I wasn't a guy who people thought was going to be the player that I am. I'm not a 'max' guy.
 "Those factors that most top free agents do, I don't have any of those concepts in my mind. I don't have a number in my mind that's, 'I can't take anything less than this'.
 "No, I'm going to look at all the offers on the table. I know what I feel like I'm worth and we'll see if their minds are in the same place as me. If not, we'll take the best deal that's on the table."
 And money is not the sole factor in play.
 "I do value certain things when it comes to picking between franchises that are offering the same numbers," he said. "That part will be easy.
 "I don't have to down-credit anybody or boost anybody. We know what teams are what. That part will be easy."

Garza also contemplated leaving for the NBA, and the coronavirus pandemic initially clouded his decision. The uncertainty of the 2020-21 college basketball season and the 2020 NBA draft made a tough choice even tougher.
 Once Garza decided to stay in Iowa City, he was all in. No doubts going forward.
 “I couldn’t be more excited about this year and coming back,” Garza said. “Going through the process, I learned a lot, but at the end of the day, going through this team’s potential, I felt like this was something I couldn’t turn down and not be a part of.”
 Garza was one of college basketball’s dominant players as a junior, averaging 23.9 points and 9.8 rebounds while shooting 54% from the field. The 6-11 big man was a first-team AP All-American and finished second to Dayton’s Obi Toppin in national player of the year voting.
 Iowa was ranked fifth — a program high — in the AP preseason Top 25, in large part because of Garza’s decision to return.
 “He might average a point or two less, but all that kid cares about is winning,” Iowa coach Fran McCaffrey said. “He’s put the time in. He’s not rested on his accomplishments. He’s hungrier than he’s ever been. There’s no better example for these young guys than Luka Garza.”
 Same could be said for Butler.
 A 6-3 guard, he had a strong freshman season in 2018-19 and was even better as a sophomore, averaging 16 points, 3.2 rebounds and 3.1 assists to earn third- team AP All-America honors.

We have to do at least 5.6 billion tonnes as a minimum or up to 10.4 billion depending on which of the models you look at.

Laurel Louise Glasco passed away the morning of November 10, 2020, with her husband of fifty years, Carroll Glasco, Jr., and children Jeremy Glasco, Sarah Glasco, Esther Glasco Loch, and Anna Glasco Erving all in Virginia to say goodbye. She was the only child of a single mom, and was born and grew up just outside San Francisco. In recent years, however, her obsession with ancestry.com paid off when she discovered that her biological father had other children. She suddenly had brothers and sisters, a whole blood family she never knew existed, and they embraced her with open arms. Meeting them and going out to Montana where they live just a few years ago with Carroll made her so very happy.      Laurel was a professional musician, a gifted pianist, organist, violinist, and violist and played in the string quartet, I Quattro Amici as well as the Hampton Roads Philharmonic Orchestra. She was also a master gardener. Laurel was intellectual, opinionated, and a veritable know-it-all, as she read a whole book every single day. She had exquisite taste in cinema and literature, and she loved jewelry and her Temptations® bakeware. She loved her husband, her cats and birds, music, and her family more than anything.      Laurel is survived by her husband, many members of her newfound Bulger family, four children, three honorary children in the exchange students from France, West Germany, and Sweden to whom she so generously opened her home in the 1980s, thirteen grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.      Laurel was an organ donor, so her memory and legacy will live on in those who receive her liver, kidneys, and lungs, and maybe the fortunate transplant recipients will get a pinch of her spunk and sass as well. Laurel was loved by so many, and she will be missed.      Due to Covid-19 restrictions, services at her church will be private, and burial will take place in Peninsula Memorial Park. Arrangements are under the care of Peninsula Funeral Home, 11144 Warwick Blvd., Newport News, VA 23601.
