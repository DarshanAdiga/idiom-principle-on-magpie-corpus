  # LA County Sheriff asks LeBron James to match $175,000 reward to help find shooter


  Chris Bumbaca


  USA TODAY


  Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva publicly requested Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James match the $175,000 reward being offered to anyone with information on the shooting that resulted in the hospitalization of two sheriff's deputies.


  The county had initially pledged $100,000, and two private donations of $50,000 and $25,000, respectively, raised the reward amount amount. If James matched the reward, the total would be $350,000.


  "I want to make a challenge. This challenge is to LeBron James," Villanueva told LA radio station 790 KABC. "I want you to match that and double that reward, because I know you care about law enforcement. You expressed a very interesting statement on race relations and officer-involved shootings and the impact it has on the African-American community. And I appreciate that.


  "But likewise, we need to appreciate that respect for life goes across professions, races, creeds and I'd like to see LeBron James step up to the plate and double that."


  Footage of the shooting shows a lone individual approaching a parked sheriff's vehicle before firing multiple rounds through the passenger-side window.


  James, like many NBA players, has become outspoken on equality and racial injustice. He also co-founded "More than a Vote," a group that has increased voter registration drives and addressed voter suppression tactics in the Black community.


  "Let's see what he does. I'll be very curious to see what his response is, if any," Villanueva said. "We got to get people to start thinking the big picture. Words have consequences. We need to tone down the rhetoric. We need to obviously get rid of the violence and spend more time trying to understand each other instead of condemning each other."


  Villanueva's department came under fire in the wake of Kobe Bryant's death. In March, the Los Angeles Times reported that deputies may have shared graphic photos of human remains from the site of the Jan. 26 helicopter crash that killed nine people.

Florida State has a talented roster with multiple future NFL Draft picks, and now a coach that has been considered one of the rising stars in the industry. There were some -- myself included -- who saw the Mike Norvell arrival as an opportunity to course correct quickly -- not all the way to national championship contention, but at least to a place where the Seminoles were in the running as the top threat to Clemson for conference supremacy.


  Saturday's 16-13 home loss to Georgia Tech, a team that was picked dead last in the preseason media poll, showed how far Florida State has to go before it can be considered even a speed bump for Clemson, much less a conference championship contender. Florida State fans who waited out a weather delay either at home or even in Doak Campbell Stadium in Tallahassee, saw something troubling when the game resumed. Even after a coaching change and buy-in from the team's leaders to turn things around in 2020, Florida State still looks like a team that has trouble finishing strong.


  Florida State was beaten soundly in the box score by Georgia Tech. The Yellow Jackets rushed for more yards and even threw for more than the Seminoles, with two blocked field goals by Marvin Wilson and two Asante Samuel interceptions helping keep the game close, as weird as that is to say. But even the down-to- down concerns take a backseat to the simple fact that just like 2018 and 2019, Florida State showed signs of a group that is getting outclassed in the fourth quarter.


  Blown fourth-quarter leads to Boise State, Virginia and Wake Forest \-- all teams that were ranked in the AP Top 25 for at least five weeks during the year -- set the program on a course for a coaching change. I believed at the time that if Florida State had won those games, then Willie Taggart might still be the coach. But Saturday's loss brought those issues back into the light with another negative scoring margin in the fourth quarter.

WASHINGTON - The government outlined a sweeping plan Wednesday to make vaccines for COVID-19 available for free to all Americans, assuming a safe and effective shot is developed, even as top health officials faced questions about political interference with virus information reaching the public.


  In a report to Congress and an accompanying “playbook” for states and localities, federal health agencies and the Defence Department sketched out complex plans for a vaccination campaign to begin gradually in January or even late this year, eventually ramping up to reach any American who wants a shot. The Pentagon would be involved with the distribution of vaccines, but civilian health workers would be the ones giving shots.


  But the whole enterprise is facing public skepticism. Only about half of Americans said they’d get vaccinated in an Associated Press-NORC poll taken in May.


  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Robert Redfield discussed the plan before Senate lawmakers Wednesday amid concerns that his agency had been pushed to revise several scientific assessments of the virus by Trump appointees.


  Redfield told members of the Senate's Appropriations Committee that the “scientific integrity” of the CDC’s output “has not been compromised and it will not be compromised under my watch.”


  Last week news outlets reported that Michael Caputo, a Health and Human Services Department political appointee, tried to gain editorial control over CDC's flagship weekly scientific report. In a separate online video last week, Caputo reportedly accused CDC scientists of conspiring against President Donald Trump's reelection.


  “It deeply saddens me that those false accusations were made,” Redfield told Senate lawmakers.


  Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, the committee’s top Democrat, said political interference had damaged public trust in the government’s health information .


  “The Trump administration needs to leave the science to the scientists immediately,” Murray said.


  As for the planned vaccine campaign, the CDC playbook for states says it is “much larger in scope and complexity than seasonal influenza or other previous outbreak-related vaccination responses." Redfield said the his agency will be working with state health officials to execute the vaccination plan in coming days.


  Although President Donald Trump asserted Tuesday in an ABC News town hall that a vaccine could be three to four weeks away, officials made it clear to reporters on a call Wednesday that widespread availability would take months.


  Among the highlights of the plan:


  — For most vaccines, people will need two doses, 21 to 28 days apart. Double- dose vaccines will have to come from the same drugmaker. There could be several vaccines from different manufacturers approved and available.

Maybe because he just told his 487,564th lie - we'll have a COVID vaccine by Friday - or he admitted he wanted to assassinate Syria's Assad or he used Russian images to tout support for our troops or he's spreading a vile #PedoBiden (pot/kettle) slur or oh yeah he's killed 195,000 people by gross negligence, but for whatever reason a new survey tags the cretinous Trump the least trusted world leader, who just 16% of people think would “do the right thing" in a crisis.

  People will only be able to meet outdoors for the time being and will not be able to meet members of their extended household indoors or form an extended household.


  Rhondda MP Chris Bryant said they will impose the same measures "which seem to be working" in locked down Welsh region Caerphilly.


  Mr Bryant attributed the rise in cases to "large groups of people" going to their caravans and mixing many households and also people ignoring social distancing in pubs.

Innovative Industrial Properties has a robust operating platform and ample liquidity to support the dividend payment.      According to Arcview Market Research and BDS Analytics, in 2019, U.S-regulated cannabis sales increased to an estimated $12.4 billion, reflecting a surge of 37% over 2018’s aggregate of $9.1 billion and are expected to approach $34 billion by 2025.      The legalization of marijuana’s medical use across several states as well as the permission for recreational consumption in some has opened up opportunities for the cannabis industry. Therefore, with more states in the United States giving cannabis the green light, Innovative Industrial Properties is partnering with the experienced medical-use cannabis operators and serving as a vital source of capital by acquiring and leasing back their real-estate assets. Its plan is to acquire the existing, redeveloped and under-development industrial buildings, including attached and enclosed greenhouse facilities.      The company generated total revenues of $24.3 million in the second quarter, marking a whopping 183% increase year on year.

  Consider the ecosystem of lucrative enterprises known as “professional services” firms. These are lawyers, accountants, bankers, consultants, architects, engineers, marketers and so on — white-collar workers who hire themselves out to help other institutions achieve their goals. Until March, it was almost unquestioned law, as if carved on stone tablets, that these professionals must do their work on airplanes, in meeting rooms, at hotels and over restaurant meals. When they weren’t meeting with clients, they were gathered together in the conference rooms of their well-appointed offices.


  The Covid Crash has smashed those stone tablets. Using digital-conferencing technologies such as Zoom, professional services firms have largely been able to continue their work without staff leaving home. The experience is better in some ways, worse in others. But it is unquestionably cheaper and consumes far less fuel.


  Given the savings to their bottom lines, and the virtuous green aura of reduced emissions, these firms will have no incentive to get back to the old ways. Post-pandemic (whenever that is), businesses will travel less, book fewer hotel rooms and rental cars, summon fewer Ubers and Lyfts, expense fewer meals and lease smaller offices.

  A recent survey by the consulting giant McKinsey & Co. found that 80 percent of businesses believe the structure and “cadence” of travel and meetings will be permanently altered by covid-19. Three out of four businesses will rely more on technology to perform “core processes.” Majorities believe their corporate cultures will change and that employees will need different skills to thrive.


  No individual business could have safely made these changes alone. Imagine telling potential clients that their services would be provided remotely, with limited face time, while competitors were offering near-constant hand-holding? But the virus instituted these cuts all at once across entire industries.


  The new economy will have big losers — hotels, airlines and expense-account restaurants come to mind. But there will be winners, too, including all those CEOs in designer ski parkas at Davos, who promised to go green without realizing they would need a pandemic to help them do it.
