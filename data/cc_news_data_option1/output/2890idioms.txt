Where reversion mutations occurred, the team found that repaired BRCA genes created proteins which differed from normal cells.
 Computer models predicted that these would often be immunogenic - meaning that the immune system would recognise them as foreign.
 Professor Paul Workman, chief executive of the ICR, said: "Cancer evolution and drug resistance is the biggest challenge we face in research and treatment today. Studies like this are incredibly valuable in dissecting out how, why and when cancers can evolve resistance to current drugs.
 "Excitingly, this research opens up the potential for a brand new approach to treatment that uses cancer's defences against it, by targeting the very mutations which give the disease resistance to existing drug therapy."
 The study, published in the Cancer Discovery journal, was funded by Cancer Research UK, Breast Cancer Now and the Schottlander Research Charitable Trust.

Tolson pointed out that Triangle had paid their taxes on the 400 acres owned by the company.
 “They paid that bill and they’ve requested the county to send them this year’s bill,” he said.
 Tolson said he has no reason to doubt Triangle’s plans and noted there was a great deal of interest and activity at the 1,449-acre Kingsboro site, which is now being marketed as the Kingsboro Business Park.
 He said he believes the decisions made by Corning (800,000-square-foot warehouse) and Triangle to locate in Kingsboro stems from the success in attracting the CSX Carolina Connector, a 350-acre intermodal facility built on what is commonly known as the CSX A-line north of Rocky Mount in Edgecombe County and capable of handling 100,000 containers annually on three cranes.
 “Our phones started ringing off the wall the next day,” he said in a previous interview. “People wanted to know who we were and where we were and why CSX was coming here.”
 With the intermodal facility to be located just north of Rocky Mount and the CSX Kingsboro Select located on the CSX Tarboro Subdivision midway between Rocky Mount and Tarboro, opportunities to connect the region to the world multiplied through ports at Wilmington and Norfolk, as well as I-95, U.S. 64 and future I-87.
 “We think the future is bright,” Tolson said. “The activity we’ve had and are having at Kingsboro is strong and the consultants we work with tell us that once the current (pandemic) situation eases, there will be a strong move to bring business back on-shore (from overseas).

SALEM — The Oregon School Activities Association is holding out hope for a fall sports season — but if there is one, it will start about a month late.
 Football's return is likely to be much later.
 The OSAA announced Wednesday it will delay the first contests of the 2020 fall season — originally set for Aug. 27 — to Sept. 23 at the earliest for soccer, cross-country and volleyball. Practices for those three sports still will start Aug. 17.
 “With the uncertainty of school reopening plans in many parts of the state and the timeframe related to those decisions, the OSAA Executive Board has decided to delay the first contest date...,” according to OSAA’s press release.
 Football remains up in the air entirely. It’s labeled a full-contact sport by the Oregon Health Authority and Oregon Gov. Kate Brown and is currently off limits because of that distinction. The press release from OSAA said the state will have to make a decision on football by Sept. 28. for there to be a regular season and postseason, which at that point would be modified.
 There has not been a date set yet by the state to review the prohibition and the possibility of lifting it, according to the press release.
 OSAA’s executive board is scheduled to meet again the week of Aug. 3, and anticipates having additional information to help it make a decision on how to proceed with the fall. Gov. Brown, in a press conference Wednesday, said direction would be coming in the days ahead on school reopenings, more mask guidance and heath metrics, according to the OSAA release, and it's likely that information would be taken into consideration during the early-August meetings.
 According to the release, the state’s sports governing body will “exhaust all options” on a method to have the season played out, even if it does not take place in the fall. The board may consider moves akin to Washington and California, who have already moved some of their fall sports to the spring. OSAA conceded that a decision to move the sports — which could result in an overlapping of seasons — could force schools into a position where they have to choose which sports to sponsor, and could result in multi-sport athletes having to elect which activity to play.

School buses continue to provide that promise today, when the world needs healing, acceptance and equity more than ever.

Bloomberg Opinion) -- Hail the South Korean recession.
 Only in the world of Covid-19 is a poor economic report card something to cheer. Gross domestic product shrank 3.3% in the second quarter from the previous three months, the Bank of Korea said Thursday. That was worse than forecast and followed a decline of 1.3% for the January-March period. No matter: The performance is streets ahead of many industrialized countries. Japan, for example, will show a contraction of more than 20%, according to economists. Global GDP is likely to have dipped about 10% in the second quarter from a year earlier, according to Bloomberg Economics.
 Korea is doing well, by comparison. Moreover, indicators suggest activity bottomed toward the end of the quarter. That’s consistent with signs of a bounce in many economies as lockdowns were eased. Consumer sentiment is healing and exports, which were hammered early in the year, are showing much smaller declines. Korea is well placed to benefit from a prolonged stretch of work-from-home. Samsung Electronics Co. and SK Hynix Inc. have enjoyed increased demand for their memory chips. The shift to kitchen-table commutes coupled with an uptick in video calls and streamed content spurred corporations and internet companies to boost installation of servers, which are heavy users of DRAM.
 The numbers are testament to a skillful pandemic response. Korea is one of the few developed economies that refrained from shutting down huge chunks of the economy. Seoul leaned instead on mass testing and contact tracing. On the face of it, the shallow nature of this recession is a direct consequence of that choice. Not that the government was remotely passive, pledging stimulus worth about 14% of GDP. Without the increase in fiscal spending, the slump would have been greater.
 While President Moon Jae-in could be forgiven for exhaling after Thursday’s numbers, the country isn’t out of the woods. Exports account for more than a third of GDP and it’s awfully hard to enjoy a meaningful recovery when the rest of the world is struggling to climb out of the deepest hole since the 1930s. Global activity isn’t likely to return to its pre-pandemic level until at least 2022. The International Monetary’s Fund’s projection of a 4.9% dip in world growth is dependent on no big return of viral infections. With renewed outbreaks roiling the U.S. and some restrictions reimposed in parts of Asia, that assumption looks vulnerable.
 It’s also important to remember that as good as Korea’s outcome is, it’s still disappointing for some officials. The central bank indicated last week that it will lower its forecast of a 0.2% annual decline in the economy. Prolonged support from both the BOK and the Blue House will be necessary. The passage of a third fiscal-stimulus bill at the start of this month will help.
 Korea is showing the benefits of keeping malls and restaurants open when other nations put them in mothballs. But it would be unwise to assume this strategy is set in stone. We learned a few months ago that when it comes to infectious disease, what leaders say one week may cease to apply the next. A country that has generally done a good job tackling the pandemic can quickly be placed on the defensive, as has been the case in Australia recently with a surge in cases in Melbourne.
 Caveats aside, South Koreans shouldn’t feel too beaten up by this recession. It could have been a whole lot worse. GDP numbers rolling in over the next few weeks are likely to show dire circumstances in many places. Korea hasn’t quite dodged the bullet, but it has ducked a cannon ball.

The Steelmen started with new boys Lamie, Mark O’Hara and Ibrox loanee Jake Hastie, looking for a morale-boosting display ahead of their league opener at Ross County in 10 days.
 However, the Rangers midfield had a firm grip on the game, with Joe Aribo, Kent and Hagi particularly impressive.
 Aribo clipped a left-foot shot over the top, moments after Carson had dived smartly to his right to keep out an effort from Hagi.
 The Romanian should have been given a penalty midway through the opening period when he was upended by Lamie, who had been undone by the quick feet of the playmaker.
 However, even Hagi’s twinkle toes were made to resemble Ann Widdecombe’s cumbersome Strictly efforts when Nigerian talisman Aribo added a stunning third five minutes before half-time.
 The former Charlton kid cut in from the left and played quickfire one-twos with Morelos and Kent as he burrowed into the heart of the Well rearguard.

As an ongoing legal action by the city plays out in 66th District Court over code enforcement violations, Hambrick said Haddad has not proceeded with repairs because they would interfere with his ability to obtain government funding for his planned building renovation.
 To avoid losing government funding, Hambrick said Haddad first must obtain an obsolete property rehabilitation exemption certificate for the building, a move council members approved unanimously Monday. The certificate not only serves as the foundation for Haddad’s plan to apply for funding, it entitles him to a tax abatement totaling $561,133 over a period of 12 years.
 Mayor Pro Tem Sue Osika pressed Hambrick on when the city could expect emergency repairs to take place. Council member Dan Law asked when the building rehabilitation is scheduled to begin.
 “It’s a thorn in everybody’s side,” Law said. “I would love to see it get going.”
 Hambrick said the project has been delayed partly due to COVID-19 restrictions, but expects to complete the rehabilitation by the deadline identified in the application for the certificate by Owosso REI Group, Haddad’s company, September 2021.
 He apologized for Haddad’s absence from a council meeting last month, causing the public hearing on the obsolete property rehabilitation certificate to be postponed.
 An additional challenge, he said, is the severely dilapidated condition of part of the building, which is divided into three sections — one along the river, a middle structure and the westernmost section, located on the corner of Main and Water streets.
 “The ‘river building’ is a big issue,” Hambrick said. “Since (Haddad) bought the building, it continues to disintegrate and the cost of saving it is very significant. We may just get rid of it and the middle building. The cost to build it new would be very much less than the cost to save what’s there.”
 He said the building is currently so unsafe that Haddad cannot even permit the contractors he’s working with to enter.
 Haddad’s development plan — the same one as put forth earlier by the previous owner, real estate broker Randy Woodworth — is to transform the 31,000-square- foot facility into retail, commercial and office space, and 17 upper-floor apartments, at an estimated cost of $8 million.

“In recent weeks there has been a radical movement to defund, dismantle and dissolve our police department,” Trump said at a White House event, blaming the movement for “a shocking explosion of shootings, killings, murders and heinous crimes of violence."
 “This bloodshed must end," he said. “This bloodshed will end.”
 The decision to dispatch federal agents to American cities is playing out at a hyperpoliticized moment when Trump is grasping for a new reelection strategy after the coronavirus upended the economy, dismantling what his campaign had seen as his ticket to a second term. With less than four months until Election Day, Trump has been warning that violence will worsen if his Democratic rival Joe Biden is elected in November and Democrats have a chance to make the police reforms they have endorsed after the killing of George Floyd and nationwide protests demanding racial justice.
 Crime began surging in some cities like Chicago, New York and Philadelphia when stay-at-home orders lifted. Criminal justice experts seeking answers have pointed to the unprecedented moment: a pandemic that has killed over 140,000 Americans, historic unemployment, a mass reckoning over race and police brutality, intense stress and even the weather. Compared with other years, crime in 2020 is down overall.
 The plan Trump announced Wednesday expands an existing program that sent hundreds of federal agents to Kansas City, Missouri, after a 4-year-old boy’s shooting death to help quell a record rise in violence. Sending federal agents to help localities is not uncommon; Attorney General William Barr announced a similar surge effort in December for seven cities with spiking violence. But this effort will include at least 100 Department of Homeland Security Investigations officers who generally conduct drug trafficking and child exploitation investigations, in addition to personnel under the Justice Department umbrella.
 DHS officers have already been dispatched to Portland, Oregon, and other localities to protect federal property and monuments as Trump has lambasted efforts by protesters to knock down Confederate statutes.
 Local authorities there have complained that agents have exacerbated tensions on the streets, while residents have accused the government of violating their constitutional rights. Indeed, civil unrest escalated after federal agents were accused of whisking people away in unmarked cars without probable cause.
 Since the racial justice protests began, Trump's campaign has leaned heavily into a pledge to maintain “law and order" as it has tried to tie Biden to a small group of radicals and anarchists it claims is trying to destabilize America’s cities and rewrite history.
 The campaign believes the push can help Trump by drumming up support from suburban and older voters who may be rattled by violent images, which have been broadcast often by conservative media outlets.
 In Chicago, Democratic Mayor Lori Lightfoot, who had initially blasted the news, said the U.S. attorney’s office will supervise the additional agents joining existing federal law enforcement offices.

Tesla will build on a 2,100-acre (85-hectacre) site in Travis County near Austin and will get more than $60 million in tax breaks from the county and a local school district over the next decade. Work on the plant, which will be over 4 million square feet, is already underway, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said.
 He did not put a number on how many vehicles the facility would produce. “Long term, a lot," Musk said.
 The company has pledged to invest $1.1 billion and said it will pay a minimum wage of $15 per hour to employees and provide health insurance, paid leave and other benefits.
 The area that’s home to the University of Texas at Austin and tech companies such as Dell Inc. was a candidate for the plant all along, but Tulsa, Oklahoma, emerged in mid-May as another possibility.
 Tesla doesn’t have a lot of time to get the factory running if it wants to meet target production dates. The company says on its website that the Cybertruck will be available starting late next year. Tesla has often missed promised production dates in the past.
 Musk has reportedly been happy with Texas, where his SpaceX rocket company has operations in Brownsville and in McGregor north of Austin.
 The new factory will be Tesla’s biggest so far, although it may not employ as many workers as the 10,000 at its factory in Fremont, California. The electric car maker has said it wants the new factory to be in the center of the country and closer to eastern markets.

Where reversion mutations occurred, the team found that repaired BRCA genes created proteins which differed from normal cells.
 Computer models predicted that these would often be immunogenic - meaning that the immune system would recognise them as foreign.
 Professor Paul Workman, chief executive of the ICR, said: "Cancer evolution and drug resistance is the biggest challenge we face in research and treatment today. Studies like this are incredibly valuable in dissecting out how, why and when cancers can evolve resistance to current drugs.
 "Excitingly, this research opens up the potential for a brand new approach to treatment that uses cancer's defences against it, by targeting the very mutations which give the disease resistance to existing drug therapy."
 The study, published in the Cancer Discovery journal, was funded by Cancer Research UK, Breast Cancer Now and the Schottlander Research Charitable Trust.

 Especially today, that seems counterintuitive. In America’s new Era of the Scoundrel, it seems the clear winners are the ones who scramble to the top by casting aside those upon whose backs their fortunes have been built, and I’m looking at you, Bill Belichick.
 But the Duke researchers ask us to consider the case of dog v. wolf. If “fittest” meant “strongest,” you would naturally bet on the wolf. But events have proved otherwise. As wolves hover at the fringe of extinction, dogs, the researchers say, “were attracted to humans and became friendly to humans, and changed their behavior, appearance and developmental makeup.”
 So nature rewards a suck-up. This is true to a point, I suppose, but if the theory were air-tight, Michael Cohen wouldn’t be behind bars.
 I think of our own hapless dog Pete, a creature for whom the phrase “bless his heart” was invented. By all rights, if there was ever an animal targeted for extinction it would be Pete. Although his vision is fine, he has this McGoo- esque tendency to — in his boundless enthusiasm — knock over every broom, coffee cup, tax-return folder, paint bucket, ladder and small child in his path.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Senate Republicans and the White House reached tentative agreement for more testing funds in the next COVID-19 relief package, but deep disagreements over the scope of the $1 trillion in federal aid remain ahead of Thursday's expected roll out. Facing a GOP revolt, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was preparing a “handful” of separate COVID-19 aid bills, according to a top lawmaker involved in the negotiations. McConnell is set to unveil the package on Thursday, according to a Republican unauthorized to discuss the private talks and granted anonymity. “Very productive meeting,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said while exiting a session late Wednesday at the Capitol. A key holdup remains President Donald Trump's push for a payroll tax cut, according to a Republican granted anonymity to discuss the private talks. Hardly any GOP senators support the idea. Instead, McConnell and some Republicans prefer another round of direct $1,200 cash payments to Americans. Mnuchin said the negotiators have agreed to an amount on direct payments, but declined to share details. The rest of the legislation is taking shape even as key Senate Republicans are rejecting the overall rescue, which is almost certain to grow. There will be no new money for cash-strapped states and cities, which are clamoring for funds, but they will be provided with additional flexibility to tap existing aid funds. Republicans propose giving $105 billion to help schools reopen and $15 billion for child care centers to create safe environments for youngsters during the pandemic. The centerpiece of the GOP effort remains McConnell’s liability shield to protect businesses, schools and others from COVID-related lawsuits. The bills will also include tax breaks for businesses...

The Greater Houston Partnership expressed hope that China would take immediate steps to address intellectual property and cybersecurity concerns. “We look forward to the reopening of the consulate in Houston once these concerns are addressed,” it said in a statement.
 Houston media reports said authorities responded to reports of a fire at the Chinese Consulate. Witnesses said people were burning paper in what appeared to be trash cans, the Houston Chronicle reported, citing police.
 Police were told that occupants were given until 4 p.m. Friday to leave the property, the Chronicle said.
 Houston police said in a tweet that officers responded to “a meet the firefighter” call at the Chinese Consulate building at 3417 Montrose Blvd. The tweet said smoke was observed in an outdoor courtyard area, and that officers were not allowed to enter the building.
 Wang accused the U.S. of opening Chinese diplomatic pouches without permission multiple times, confiscating Chinese items for official use and imposing restrictions on Chinese diplomats in the U.S. last October and again in June. He also said that U.S. diplomats in China engage in infiltration activities.
 “If we compare the two, it is only too evident which is engaged in interference, infiltration and confrontation,” Wang said.
 He also said that the Chinese Embassy in Washington has received bomb and death threats, and accused the U.S. government of fanning hatred against China.
 President Trump, his reelection prospects damaged by the coronavirus outbreak, has blamed China repeatedly for the pandemic. Almost every day brings a fresh U.S. action against what Trump has called the rising Asian superpower’s exploitation of America.
 Already this week, the Commerce Department has sanctioned 11 Chinese companies over alleged human rights abuses in the Xinjiang region and the Justice Department said two Chinese stole intellectual property and targeted companies developing coronavirus vaccines.
 Pompeo is expected to continue the attacks Thursday in a speech on U.S.-China relations at the Nixon Library in California.

HONOLULU (AP) — Hurricane Douglas gathered strength as it barreled west toward the Hawaiian Islands on a track to potentially bring strong winds and flash flooding to the island chain over the weekend, weather forecasters said. The storm had maximum sustained winds of 100 mph (155 kph), making it a Category 2 hurricane as of late Wednesday, the National Hurricane Center said. It's expected to become a Category 3 hurricane on Thursday, said John Bravender, warning coordination meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Honolulu. Cooler waters east of Hawaii and wind shear were expected to weaken the storm before it reaches the islands. The weather service said it's likely to be either at hurricane or near-hurricane strength when it arrives. It's too early to predict the precise path of the storm in the islands. Bravender said any part of the state could be affected. Douglas was 1,570 miles (2,530 kilometers) southeast of Hawaii as of late Wednesday. In the Gulf of Mexico, Tropical Depression Eight formed and a tropical storm warning was issued for much of the Texas coast. The depression was located about 530 miles (852 kilometers) east-southeast of Port O'Connor, Texas, with maximum sustained winds of 30 mph (48 kph). It was moving west-northwest at 9 mph (14 kph). The center of the depression is expected to move across the northwestern Gulf of Mexico on Thursday and Friday and make landfall along the Texas coast on Saturday. Slow strengthening is expected and the depression could become a tropical storm in a day or so. The storm is expected to produce 2-4 inches (5-10 centimeters) of rain with isolated totals of 6 inches (15 centimeters) along the Gulf Coast from Louisiana to the lower Texas coast, and inland through south-central Texas and the Rio Grande...

And as they performed well and the first six that we've done have come out of the box with a higher sales, we're going to look to add more relocations, more remodels so that we can bring more Chipotlane, not just through new stores, but through these other approaches as well.

“Then, after dinner we walked down to Barrier Island Brewery and sat outside for dessert. Normally, I would have surprised her with a lot more people, but we kept it small due to COVID. We had themed masks and decorations ... no hugs or blowing out candles. We definitely wanted open air seating outside. That’s a big factor nowadays as to where we decide to eat regardless of a celebration.”
 Like Baskin, Tiffany Willis also found herself planning a party but with a different take. The Brunswick mama marked three of her children’s special days in quarantine, which demanded a bit of creativity.
 Twins, Ryan and Liam, and older sister, Marissa, celebrated back in April — four days apart.
 “We were practicing extreme social distancing at the time. We have at-risk family members and out-of-town family, so we decided we would have a Zoom birthday party,” Willis said.
 “Some of the local grandparents wanted to watch the kiddos open presents so they distanced (with masks) in our driveway while we opened presents in the garage.”
 During those early days of uncertainty, the diligent mama bear was taking no chances.
 “We didn’t want to exchange gifts so they ordered gifts from Amazon and I sanitized them and wrapped them with Christmas paper I had on hand. We did have water bottles and a hand sanitizer at the ‘party’ ... 2020,” she said.
 Like the Willis family, the Beards also celebrated their little one in the early days of the outbreak.
 Megan Beard says they rang in her son Benji’s fourth birthday right before the shelter-in-place order was issued. While the uncertain climate meant he couldn’t have a formal party, the family enlisted the help of his friends to make sure he felt extra loved.
 “We delivered homemade cupcakes to all of his friend’s porches around town. Little did he know, all of his friends left presents for him on the porch to pick up,” she said.
 “They also made banners and signs to hold while they waved through the windows. It was a magical day. He thought it was the best birthday ever.”
 But it’s not just moms and dads that are looking for ways to lift spirits these days. Some complete strangers enjoy spreading a little cheer during these trying times.
 Joey Sannutti and other members of the Red Knights Motorcycle Club have started doing birthday drive-bys as a way to celebrate the occasion.
 “What got us started was my neighbor asking if I could have a few friends ride-by to wave to her son. We joined in with the golf carts on Blythe Island to visit a few kids (there), then rode to my neighborhood. We had balloons on a few of the motorcycles — not the best idea for riding, they didn’t work as well as we hoped,” he said.
 But the bikers adapted and the cause grew with members from other clubs starting to join the birthday tributes. These included riders from the Red Knights, Ordo Templi Motorcyle Club, Southern Riders Association and several independent riders.
 “We have done several in Glynn County, we have also been to Savannah and Jesup. The response has been absolutely amazing. The birthday kids (and a few kids at heart) have all been extremely excited to see us,” he said. “One of the more memorable ones was the Savannah run, we were joined by a group of motorcycles and dune buggies, nearly 30 vehicles. The neighborhood was out waiting for us, they lined the street waving and ‘cheering’ for us as we rode through.”

 The Booneville non-school softball team played in the Arkansas High School Invitational over the weekend in Russellville.
 After a loss to Lamar on Saturday, They had a thrilling game with Perryville on Sunday in which they came back from three runs down with two outs in the top of the fifth inning to take the lead. However, Perryville came back and scored two runs in the bottom half of the inning to win it, 8-7.
 The games in the tournament were five innings in length.
 Though the results of the games did not work out, it did give the team a chance to continue working toward next school season, whenever that may be. It also afforded an opportunity for closure for seniors Shelby Posey and Baylee Moses. Both of them reached base in their final time at bat for Booneville.
 Attention now turns to next season, and coach Ronnie Denton is looking for competitiveness out of his team as they move to a new conference. He cited his two seniors as examples that every girl on the team needs to follow for next season.
 Lamar 4 Booneville 0
 Shelby Posey singled with two out in the top of the first inning but slipped on the infield dirt as she was rounding the bag and was tagged out. That turned out to be a microcosm of what was to happen as Lamar scored three runs without benefit of a hit in the bottom of the inning. Walks, errors and passed balls contributed to the Lamar uprising.
 After a quiet second inning, Baylee Moses and Brylee Washburn both hit rockets to center field in the third inning, but the Lamar centerfielder was up to the task. Booneville's defense got them out of trouble in the bottom of that ending when Lakyn Sanders, attempting to advance to third after a dropped throw, was thrown out at third by Sara Ulmer with shortstop Layla Byrum applying the tag. The next batter flied out to Moses in center to end the threat.
 But Booneville could not get anything going off Lamar hurler Bailee Cowell and Lamar would add another run in the fourth inning. Booneville would mount a threat in the fifth inning as Brooke Turner reached on an error. Joleigh Tate forced out courtesy runner Hayley Lunsford at second before Moses got an infield single. On the play, Sanders overthrew first and the runners each advanced a base, but Cowell retired the next batter to end the game.
 Posey and Moses, the two seniors, got the only two Booneville hits in the game. Turner allowed only one earned run, settling down after walking three batters in the first inning.
 Perryville 8 Booneville 7
 Booneville wasted no time getting runs on the board in the first inning. With one out, Leigh Swint rifled a double into the left-field corner. Two wild pitches later, Booneville had their first run. The next two batters, Shelby Posey and Brooke Turner, each reached base when the Perryville third baseman overthrew first base on a grounder. The next two batters, Shelby Posey and Brooke Turner, both reached when the Perryville third baseman overthrew first base on ground balls. Posey scored on a grounder by Joleigh Tate but on ball four to Sara Ulmer, Hayley Lunsford, Who is running for Turner, was retired trying to score after the ball temporarily got away from the Perryville catcher.
 Perryville answered with four runs in the bottom of the inning on three walks, two doubles and a wild pitch. It could have gotten worse except that Perryville's Mallory Hawkins, trying to go to third after reaching on a throwing error, was thrown out at third by Tate. Turner continued to have problems with her control and she was relieved by Emily Suttles.
 After a walk to Alyssa Rudolph with a runner on third, she stole second. But that was supposed to have been part of a double steal and the runner from third didn't move; Rudolph rounded the bag too far and was caught in rundown and eventually retired before the runner from third crossed the plate.
 Perryville would add another run in the second inning but Booneville got that one back in the third. Byrum singled, stole second and eventually scored after two ground outs with Posey getting the RBI. Booneville would threaten again in the fourth after Moses walked and scooted all the way to third on a wild pitch, but Perryville pitcher Shelby Powell got out of the jam.
 Perryville added what looked to be an insurance run in the bottom of the fourth. Byrum singled with one out in the fifth but Swint was retired. Posey, though, ripped a double to plate Byrum but then Turner struck out, seemingly ending the game. But the ball got away from the catcher far enough for Turner to reach first safely, with Posey taking third.
 Lunsford came on to run for her and on the next pitch, Tate hit one into no man's land between the shortstop and the third baseman, scoring Posey. Then on the pitch after that, Ulmer dropped one into short right field to score Lunsford. Tate took third on the hit and scored on a wild pitch, giving Booneville the lead. Moses followed with a walk and took second on indifference but Booneville could not get the runners across.
 Suttles, who had been going along well, suddenly had her control go away as she walked two of the first three batters, with another reaching on an infield hit. With the bases loaded, Turner returned to the circle, but two walks later the game was over.
 Byrum was 2-for-3 and she and Posey each scored twice; Posey and Tate each had two RBIs while Ulmer was 2-for-2 with an RBI.
