 The trip had started off as usual. A mission to St. John’s, Newfoundland, the easternmost habitable town in North America. The reason Reid, Jake, and I chose this locale was the exact same reason that Maria Thomsen, Niels Schack, Ethan Deiss, Dean “Blotto” Gray, Malachi Gerard, Joe Carlino, Mark Wilson, Nick Erickson, Parker Szumowski, Seamus Foster, Marc O’Malley, Derrek Lever, Spencer Schubert, Tommy Gesme, Colton Feldman, and Jed Anderson also decided to pull the trigger. The snow conditions in January in the US were fickle to say the least, and rumors were swirling that it was even raining in street snowboarding meccas like Stockholm and Helsinki. Winter simply wasn’t working in our favor, and so, like many missions to areas that are holding, everyone headed to St. John’s.

 For thirteen years, I’ve been ﬂying in and out of storms, so hearing rumors of a blizzard doesn’t really ever concern me. Still, we kept our eye on the weather. As the week went on, the locals’ tales seemed to grow taller by the hour and this storm seemed to strengthen with every adjective used to describe it. Storm of the century. Bomb cyclone. Hurricane blizzard. Apocalyptic whiteout conditions. Terms I had never heard lumped together to describe a winter storm. By Thursday, Jed had decided to pull the plug (smartly, may I add) and get outta town. We ﬁgured it was worth it to call the airlines to see if the rest of us could get on a ﬂight the same evening, only to be borderline laughed at by the customer service representatives as they informed us that the earliest ﬂights out we could get on were the ones we already had booked. We headed back to the Airbnb after dropping Jed off, packed up, and drank some red wine as this storm barreled down on St. John’s. Later that evening, almost simultaneously, our phones began dinging and buzzing, informing us that our ﬂights the next morning were cancelled. We called, waited on hold, rebooked for the following day and continued sipping red wine and watching Netﬂix. A few hours later, our phones started dinging and buzzing again. This time, it was a state of emergency declaration from the Canadian government. What the fuck? It wasn’t even snowing yet. Odd. At that point, there was no other option than to call it a night, see what the storm did, and head home on Saturday.

Arteta has recently come under a lot of scrutiny, some justified, but a lot has been completely over the top. I just want us to take a quick overview of his Arsenal managerial career so far. Obviously results only tell half the story. Performances is where we can really see what’s working or not. Put simply, our defence is now the best it’s been in well over a decade, but our attack is the worst it’s been in well over two decades.
 Despite our poor attack though, we have seen a monumental improvement against top opponents, not just in terms of results, but the collective performances as well. Looking ahead, this bodes well for Arteta, because he’s pretty much solved the toughest area first, which is competing and beating the big boys, and winning trophies. Gone are the days of us getting regularly torn to shreds against a decent team. Even in defeat, we are now competing. Imagine what more Arteta can do once he has more of his own signings? He just needs to solve the issue of our attacking when the onus is on us against the so called “lesser teams”.
 So, let’s take a quick look at Arteta’s record so far:

As for us, we bailed on our Airbnb on the second day of our isolation as soon as we heard that the Sheraton down the road from us had plenty of power, a plethora of beer, and a hot tub. Though we did manage to hit two spots in the handful of days when we were locked down, with more information came wiser decisions and at a certain point, it simply became too dangerous to keep riding. So we simply settled into the suffering, waited on the phone with our airlines and lost track of time in empty bottles of beer. For me, the purest moment of clarity came on the third day of being trapped on the island, when I fully realized that this was our new reality. After countless phone calls to my wife, my friends, United Airlines, Air Canada, and the multitude of outlets that I had at my disposal, I was simply not going to get home on my time schedule. All the stress, all the worry simply vanished. When I threw up my hands and admitted to myself that this was not in my control any longer, it was the best moment of the entire trip and I will never forget it.

And at that particular point in time, there was nothing that we could possibly do aside from wait it out and see how much damage would be done. We headed back inside, took a quick inventory of our food that we had bought a few days earlier “just in case:” three bottles of red wine, a box of Chips Ahoy! cookies, a dozen beers, and some pasta for dinner that night.
