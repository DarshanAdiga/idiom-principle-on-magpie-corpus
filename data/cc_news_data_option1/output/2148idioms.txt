For an investor that is lacking international exposure and they want a professional to manage these assets for them - I believe that ETO and ETG both present an attractive proposition. For an investor that is still reluctant to add international exposure, I believe EVT can fit the bill as a respectable fund investing primarily in the U.S. Although, the fund does still hold about 10% of its portfolio outside of the U.S., which isn't significant at all.


  Additionally, for an investor considering any of these funds, they should consider the added risks that leverage can produce. Though it has the upside of adding to strong returns over the longer-term - over the short-term, it can add significantly more volatility as well!

The voices of outrage, however, are being heard well beyond U.S. borders.
 Several soccer players protested during matches in Germany's top-flight Bundesliga at the weekend, with Borussia Dortmund's Jadon Sancho and Achraf Hakimi displaying undershirts with the message, "Justice for George Floyd" on Sunday.
 The German Football Association (DFB) said it was reviewing the incidents.
 England international Sancho was shown a yellow card after removing his shirt but the DFB said it was not due to his message but because he broke the rules on removing shirts.
 FIFA UNDERSTANDS
 FIFA, an organisation that has had zero tolerance for players expressing personal views about politics, religion and social issues on the field, has asked competition organisers to use "common sense" with athletes who show messages of protest over Floyd's death.
 In a statement on Tuesday, the global soccer body said it "fully understands the depth of sentiment and concerns expressed by many footballers in light of the tragic circumstances of the George Floyd case".
 It added that applying the laws of the game was the responsibility of competition organisers, such as domestic leagues, who FIFA said "should use common sense and have in consideration the context surrounding the events.
 "FIFA had repeatedly expressed itself to be resolutely against racism and discrimination of any kind... FIFA itself has promoted many anti-racism campaigns which frequently carry the anti-racism message at matches organised under its own auspices," it added.
 Former West Indies captain Daren Sammy has urged cricket's world governing body, the International Cricket Council, and its member nations to speak out against social injustice.
 "@ICC and all the other boards are you guys not seeing what's happening to ppl like me? Are you not gonna speak against the social injustice against my kind..." he wrote in a series of tweets.
 "Now is not the time to be silent. I wanna hear u," the St Lucia all-rounder, who led West Indies to Twenty20 World Cup titles in 2012 and 2016, said.
 His former team mate Chris Gayle also posted a statement on social media saying "Black life matters just as any other life!"
 Formula One drivers followed Lewis Hamilton's lead on Monday after he criticised those in what he called the "white dominated sport" for failing to speak out about Floyd's death.
 Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc said on Twitter he had felt "out of place and uncomfortable" sharing his thoughts on social media about the situation but realised he had been "completely wrong".

 Republicans are looking to maintain their majorities in both the state Senate and Assembly heading into 2021, when the Legislature will be charged with the once-a-decade job of redistricting. Because of how the lines were drawn by Republicans the last time, there are very few competitive races beyond open seats where the battles are largely fought in the primaries.
 Republicans hold a 19-14 majority in the state Senate where 16 seats are on the ballot. Three seats held by Republicans and four by Democrats are open, mostly due to retirements.

As luck would have it, the Army brought the direct commission program online about a month later. I considered the Navy and Air Force as well. My understanding of the Navy’s direct commission program was they only allow direct commission officers to serve for five years and then they are not eligible to continue service. Even though some might be interested in serving for a short time, I wanted the option to continue serving. Why invest yourself into something that is not investing into you? I wanted to be able to dedicate myself to something that would not just let me go at the end of five years. Above all else … once I knew the Army had a program, no other program had a chance.”

The England captain said on Tuesday that he would attend the birth come what may, with Stokes in line to take over.Root has no doubt the star all-rounder would cope with the extra burdens of captaincy."I think if Ben was captain he would be fantastic," said Root."One of his great qualities as vice-captain and as a leader is he sets the example, the way he goes about his training, how he wants to bowl in difficult circumstances, the way he stands up in different scenarios with the bat."He drags people with him and gets the best out of the players around him."Stokes was restored to the England vice-captaincy after missing the 2017/18 Ashes in Australia, before being acquitted on an affray charge following an incident outside a nightclub.Since then he has played a starring role during England's triumphant World Cup campaign and scored a stupendous unbeaten Test hundred as England beat Australia at Headingley.Although England want to keep their squad in a secure "bubble" to prevent the spread of COVID-19, they have said players will be allowed to spend time between matches with their families."The start of July is the due date, so that complicates things slightly," said Root."In terms of the bubble, and the pregnancy, it's always an evolving thing, it's being discussed currently with the medical team."The ECB confirmed the revised dates for the West Indies series on Tuesday and Root said it would be a huge boost for the game even if they are behind closed doors."It must be extremely scary and I think the whole cricketing world will be grateful to see some cricket again," he said.Root returns to trainingThe 29-year-old was back in the nets for the first time this season on Monday, working with former England coach Peter Moores at Trent Bridge."There are obviously a lot of protocols put in place, but it wasn't too dissimilar to how you would normally go about a net session," said Root."To start with, everything seems a million miles an hour. Slowly, as a few hours went on, it seemed to come back to me. By the end of it, I felt really good."And Root said his enforced break from cricket had allowed him time to think about his game both as a captain and a batsman. He said he felt refreshed as he aims to improve on a record of 48 Test fifties but only 17 hundreds."Hopefully that has a positive impact on both sides of my cricket and we can start seeing a few more converted scores and England winning plenty of games," he added.England fast bowler Jofra Archer has suggested crowd noise is pumped into grounds to compensate for the lack of fans at the matches. "It depends if they're saying I should be sacked in the morning," joked Root. "But a few Barmy Army chants a couple of times a session would be nice.

An entertainment industry task force sent dozens of recommendations to the governors of California and New York, two of the largest US production hubs, and was awaiting a green light to return to sets. Filming around the world was halted in mid-March to help curb the coronavirus pandemic.
 In a 22-page blueprint, the task force urged regular testing for cast and crew and daily monitoring of symptoms through temperature checks or other measures. Crew members would be told to wear face masks.
 Actors, however, would not be able to wear masks or other personal protective equipment while filming. They would be advised to minimize scenes with close contact or use digital effects to portray intimate moments. TV shows also would be discouraged from filming before a live audience.
 The guidelines were developed by a task force that included representatives from Walt Disney Co, Netflix Inc , AT&T Inc's Warner Bros and Comcast Corp's NBCUniversal, plus unions including SAG-AFTRA, IATSE and the Directors Guild of America.
 Testing is "the cornerstone" of the recommendations and rapid results will be needed, according to a statement from Directors Guild President Thomas Schlamme and the group's national executive director, Russell Hollander.
 "Without testing, the entire cast and crew would be working in an environment of unknown risk," the statement said.
 Actors and those in closest contact with them should be tested more often, they added, since they will not be wearing personal protective equipment while on camera.
 On Tuesday, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors will discuss its requirements for restarting productions in the county, home to several movie studios and sound stages.

LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - Jimmy Fallon returned to "The Tonight Show" on Monday, promising "a different kind of show" in light of nationwide protests over the killing of George Floyd by Minnesota Police.
 Before addressing the demonstrations in reaction to police brutality that are roiling the country, Fallon told viewers he would "start personally and expand out" because "that's where we need to start, with ourselves and looking at ourselves in the mirror."
 "I had to really examine myself in the mirror this week because a story came out about me on 'SNL' doing an impression of Chris Rock in blackface," he said. "And I was horrified.

 "I respect this guy more than I respect most humans,'" Fallon said of Rock, his former "Saturday Night Live" castmate. "'I'm not a racist. I don't feel this way.'"
 When the "Saturday Night Live" clip, which first aired in 2000, resurfaced and was getting backlash online, Fallon said initially he "kept getting advised to just stay quiet and not say anything." "That's the advice," he said," because we're all afraid."
 At the risk of saying something that might get him in more trouble, Fallon explained to his audience, he issued a written statement on Twitter that said, "In 2000, while on SNL, I made a terrible decision to do an impersonation of Chris Rock while in blackface. There is no excuse for this. "I am very sorry for making this unquestionably offensive decision and thank all of you for holding me accountable."
 But after demonstrations last weekend about systemic racism and the need for criminal justice reform, Fallon said he realized he had to do more.
 "I realized that the silence is the biggest crime that white guys like me and the rest of us are doing, staying silent. We need to say something. We need to keep saying something. And we need to stop saying 'That's not OK' more than just one day on Twitter," he said.
 Fallon said it's not enough to take to social media to offer thoughts and prayers. It takes action for any real change to occur.
 "We cannot try to bury this again. It's not going to get buried, it's not going away," he said. "You can't just hope everyone loves each other. We can't say 'be the change' and just sit around tweeting 'be the change, be the change.'"
 He then introduced NAACP President Derrick Johnson, who praised Fallon's monolog. "In this time, many people are searching for answers and display of anger and hopelessness and wandering, more people need to speak about where they are with an authentic voice," Johnson said. "I think you did that."
 Later in the show, Fallon was joined by CNN's Don Lemon, who said there was a path to a better America if people stopped "making excuses for racism."
 "We can't go back to the way we were before," Lemon said. "This is a time for us to change. I appreciate you for stepping up and being a leader."

EPS growth is a percentage change in standardized earnings per share over the trailing-twelve-month period to the current year-end. The company posted a value of -$21.05 as earning-per-share over the last full year, while a chance, will post $4.46 for the coming year. The current EPS Growth rate for the company during the year is -21.10% and predicted to reach at 50.27% for the coming year. In-depth, if we analyze for the long-term EPS Growth, the out-come was -6.00% for the past five years and the scenario is totally different as the current prediction is -2.57% for the next five year.

In May of 2001, a young congressional staffer went missing in Washington, D.C. Her name was Chandra Levy. She had been murdered in a park in Washington, and her remains were not found until a year later.
   
 During the course of the investigation, the Washington police discovered Levy might have been having an affair with then California Rep. Gary Condit. Media speculation went rampant, especially after Levy's body was found in 2002 -- a midterm election year. Condit went on to lose his race.
   
 A few months after Levy died, a young woman working in the Fort Walton Beach, Florida, office of then Rep. Joe Scarborough fell over dead in his office. On July 20, 2001, Lori Klausutis' body was found. She had fallen over, struck her head and died. The coroner determined she had an undiagnosed heart condition, which had caused her to collapse.
   
 As Americans headed into the 2002 election , political tempers began to flare, and with speculation on Gary Condit, some left-wing activists wanted a "whataboutism" to combat the attention. They settled on Joe Scarborough and Lori Klausutis.
   
 As Scarborough's career in the media rose, the fever swamps of the left got louder. The left-wing activists such as Daily Kos, a pretty establishment website for left-wing activists, let the rumors about Scarborough fly. Propagandist and noted communist sympathizer Michael Moore even registered a website domain to promote the conspiracy that Scarborough was a murderer.
   
 Over the years, the allegations went away. They resurfaced in 2009 as an immigrant from Central America was figured for killing Chandra Levy. Then they went away again. They have resurfaced with President Donald Trump.
   
 I don't really care what you think about Joe Scarborough, but no American deserves to have the President of the United States targeting him with accusations of murder. No American deserves the President of the United States tweeting out salacious and unproven accusations suggesting murder and conspiracy. The deceased's family does not deserve it. Her widower does not deserve it. The fact that President Trump does not seem to understand that should bother every one of us.
   
 There's no whataboutism here. There's no "two can play that game." There's no decency in this. If you really think these sorts of things are justified, you are no better than the people you hate. You have become what you hate. The President, in doing this, has become no better than the Michael Moores of the world.
   
 It is shameful and gross.
   
 Concurrent to all of this is a growing panic in several swing states that the President is falling behind Joe Biden. The Trump campaign was attempting a Bush versus Kerry approach to 2020, seeking to define Biden in the time leading up to the Democratic National Convention. But the Trump team has now taken a very undisciplined approach of throwing everything out to see what sticks. There is no comprehensive or overarching narrative and theme about Biden.
   
 Some Republican leaders are privately concerned the President's team is painting a rosier picture for the President than reality presently suggests. Outside groups have been reiterating that key constituencies the President needs for his reelection are starting to drift away. They are not, thankfully, beyond reach, but the President's team does not seem to have a good strategy to get them back.
   
 Combine the polling and the President's sudden infatuation with old left-wing conspiracies, and it seems the President is more focused on score-settling than winning reelection. That should bother the President's supporters. Joe Scarborough is not on the ballot. Joe Biden is.
   
 Last week, the President spent his time focused on resurrecting old conspiracies that accused an innocent man of murder while dredging up the pain of loss for a dead woman's family. He should have focused on a man who could fill seats on the Supreme Court and who is ahead in most polls in the swing states the President needs to win.

Democrat Tom Palzewicz, who ran against Sensenbrenner in 2018 and lost by 24 points, is also running.
 There will be a rematch of last month's special election to fill northern Wisconsin's 7th Congressional District. Republican Tom Tiffany handily won the special election by 14 points over Democrat Tricia Zunker. They will meet again in November with a full, two-year term on the line.
 Incumbents in Wisconsin's six other congressional districts are all running again. The Democrats are Mark Pocan, who represents the Madison and surrounding south-central Wisconsin area; Gwen Moore, of Milwaukee; and Kind, who has represented western Wisconsin since 1996.
 Both Pocan and Moore are in safe Democratic districts.
 Republican Peter Theron, of Madison, filed to challenge Pocan for a third time. Pocan easily defeated him in both 2014 and 2016. Republican Tim Rogers, a delivery driver, and independent Robert Raymond are challenging Moore for a second time. Moore cruised to victory over them both in 2018 with 76% of the vote. Republican Army veteran Cindy Werner of Milwaukee is also running.
 Republican incumbents, in addition to Tiffany, are Mike Gallagher, of Green Bay, who represents northeast Wisconsin; Glenn Grothman, of Glenbeulah, whose district includes conservative northern Milwaukee suburbs and Bryan Steil, of Janesville, who represents southeast Wisconsin.
 Democratic state Rep. Amanda Stuck, who is completing her sixth year in the state Assembly, is giving up her seat to take on Gallagher. Democrats Roger Polack, a political newcomer, and 2018 gubernatorial candidate Josh Pade both registered to run against Steil. Republican John Baker of Mukwonago filed nomination papers late Monday to force a primary against Steil
 Democrats Jessica King, Matthew Boor and Michael Beardsley filed to run against Grothman. King, an attorney, served a year and a half in the state Senate after winning a recall election in 2011.
 The primary for races with more than two candidates is Aug. 11 with the general election on Nov. 3.

The steady interest from growers comes as wholesale prices for hemp products have dropped by 60 percent in some cases, according to the two private companies that track the hemp markets.
 Price reporting agency Hemp Benchmarks and commodity trading platform PanXchange say between January and April of this year, the hemp products nearly all saw double-digit percentage point losses.
 Hemp Benchmarks pegged the price of hemp flower — from which the increasingly popular CBD oil is extracted — at $145 per pound in April, a 36 percent tumble from its $226 per pound price point in January. PanXchange put the drop in price for processed hemp flowers between 21 percent and 32 percent.
 The platforms also reported the price of crude oil extracted from hemp flowers dropped between 21 percent and 46 percent, while the price of hemp seed dropped from $1,435 per pound to $578 per pound.
 Kristen Nichols, the editor of Hemp Industry Daily, told WisPolitics.com "the early days of just eye-popping returns are gone, and they're not coming back." She attributed the change to the 2018 Farm Bill that legalized the crop and removed the shackles from hemp pilot programs.
 “(Hemp) not being on the black market anymore is great news for a producer, but they are now subject to economic headwinds,” she said. “You want to make money like a black market drug dealer but not be in the black market? Well, that’s not how life works.”
 While that hasn’t been reflected in preliminary data DATCP has for this growing season, the makeup of hemp growers has shifted dramatically in the crop’s third legal season.
 The more than sixfold expansion in the number of grower applications between the crop’s first pilot year in 2018 and last year was largely fueled by 1,320 new applicants while 171 farmers reapplied for the program. This year the split is 745 new applicants and 732 returning growers.

I’ve never been so glad to reach the top of St. Peter’s Dome. Even under heavy gray skies, the view from its high, rocky outcrop was spectacular. A forested mosaic in shades of green stretched all the way north to the shimmering strip of Chequamegon Bay on Lake Superior. Hiking up, the tree canopy felt closed. But from above, the fuzzy white of emerging bigtooth aspen and the reddish tinge of young oak leaves hinted at a more precise phenology. Despite our recent warm days, it’s not quite summer.
 It is, however, full-on bug season. I didn’t race to the top because of the view; I was chased there while seeking a stiff breeze and refuge from the biting hordes. I don’t hike much after the mosquitoes hatch, but on this day I had a special mission that was worth the blood loss.

For the most part, bringing home a new pet is a very exciting time for you and your pet -- but many pets suffer from anxiety when brought into a new environment. Similar to humans who start a new job or attend their first day of college on a huge and unfamiliar campus, a new home or apartment is foreign to the pet and they need time to adjust to their surroundings.
   
 Too often, people hurry a dog or cat into liking their new home environment. Give your pet some time to adjust, to smell, to explore so they can become more comfortable at their own pace. This is especially true when there are other pets already in the home.
    Discover, share and discuss everything about pets in the News-Journal's News- Journal Pets! Facebook group.  
 "They fight like cats and dogs!" is a common metaphor, and many times very true. Young, healthy cats are much faster than most dogs, so they can defend themselves from the overly aggressive canine if needed, but an older cat or a kitten can be in peril.
   
 Take time when introducing the new pet to the current pets. It may take several weeks or even months for animals to accept each other, but don't rush the process. If the pets do not adjust and live harmoniously after three months, some additional behavior training may be required.
   
 Many years ago, I had a 6-year-old German shepherd mix and we decided to adopt a Cocker spaniel puppy. At first, they were fine together until one evening when the puppy decided to help himself to the older dog's food dish while the older dog happened to be eating from it. The shepherd nipped the puppy and the puppy ran like the wind up the stairs yelping more out of fear than from being injured. He ran past several people and ended up jumping into my lap as he whimpered. He was fine, but he learned that day to never go by the larger dog when he is eating.
   
 Like a child doing something that they shouldn't and getting injured, animals learn by their mistakes as well. Of course, a pecking order will be established and the more dominate dog will take their position as pack leader, however the owner needs to maintain their position as the alpha dog. As long as your pets respect you and your authority, they will behave and get along much better.
   
 There is a common believe of the 3-3-3 philosophy. The first three days the pet is in the home, the pet is anxious and not sure of their environment. They may be scared and act confused. They might not eat and may even have an accident in the home. This is not unusual and is temporary.
   
 After three weeks, the pet is more at ease and feeling much better about their new home. The pet will be playing more, eating when fed, wanting treats, and asking for people to cuddle and stroke their head.
   
 After three months, the pet will be completely at home and will accept the home as their own. They will have learned the daily routines, the rules of the home, the behavior signs of other animals in the home so as to coexist as peacefully as possible, and at last they will learn how to manipulate their owner so they can get whatever they want (sneaky pets)!
   
 Many people adopt a dog or cat and return the animal to the shelter a week later. We hear comments like, "She's not well-trained," or "He is very protective of his food or toys," etc. Pets need to be trained and they do not come with any guarantees. A positive outcome is based on how the owner treats and trains the animal. Without guidance from their owner, pets will act as they wish.
   
 We see many animals go to home after home and be returned each time until they find their forever home. Their last owner will call and say, "I don't know why previous owners said this dog was not good with other animals because he is perfect with our cat and he loves to play with the dog next door." Sometimes it just takes the right family to love and train the pet for a successful outcome.
   
 To put a twist on the famous JFK line, "Ask not what your pet can do for you; ask what you can do for your pet." And remember, adopt, don't shop.

The number of people venturing out to restaurants remains anemic, despite loosened rules.
 Given that, we’d argue that the chance of large crowds gathering in Cambridge or Deerfield because a few more tables have been put out, will remain small for the time being.
 I would help bolster the bottom lines of our area restaurants.
 In Cambridge, there are spaces where this could easily happen. There’s Mill Street that has been blocked off in recent summers for the Keystone Grill’s RibFest. During Midwest Fire Fest in recent past summers, a blocked-off North Pleasant has been lined with food carts. Portions of Spring Water Alley and/or the Amundson Community Center parking lot could easily be blocked off and set with tables.
 In Deerfield, an obvious choice to block off and set with tables is Park Drive between Main Street and Fireman’s Park. Allowing tables in the parking lot outside the Pickle Tree restaurant on the village’s south side also seems feasible.
 With fairs and festivals canceled this summer, going out to eat may be one of our few remaining sources of local entertainment.
 We hope Cambridge and Deerfield municipal leaders consider following the lead other communities by making it easier for local restaurants to place tables outside.
 We hope municipalities consider, too, the novel idea of outdoor café nights, as take-out weary restaurant-goers look for additional ways to support their favorite local eateries.
 Allowing a few more tables outside could be good for customers and restaurant owners alike.

9 Things You Should Avoid In Business Emailing

One of the most targeted races is for a seat in La Crosse vacated by former Democratic Minority Leader Jennifer Shilling. Former Republican state Sen. Dan Kapanke is running, as are three Democrats. One of them, Brad Pfaff, was fired as Gov. Tony Evers state agriculture secretary by the GOP-controlled Senate last year.
 In the Assembly, Republicans have a 63-36 majority and all 99 seats are up. The most hotly contested races are in primaries for the 13 open seats where six Republicans and seven Democrats not running again.
 In congressional races, Republicans are targeting Democratic Rep. Ron Kind in western Wisconsin district President Donald Trump won by 4.5 points four years ago. Republicans think Kind is vulnerable because of how well Trump did in the district in 2016. Kind was unopposed in 2018.
 Two Republicans — Derrick Van Orden and Jessie Ebben — in addition to Democrat Mark Neumann filed to run against Kind. Neumann is a retired pediatrician, not the former Republican congressman from the Milwaukee area with the same name.
 Van Orden is a former Navy SEAL who grew up in southeastern Wisconsin and then moved back to the state after his military career ended in 2015. He has done consulting work on leadership and opened a cafe in northern Wisconsin. This is his first run for office. Ebben is a public relations professional in Eau Claire.
 For the first time in 42 years, Jim Sensenbrenner will not be on the ballot for Congress. The Republican who represents a conservative congressional district that covers of Milwaukee's western suburbs is retiring. Scott Fitzgerald, the Republican state Senate majority leader, is vying for the seat.
 Republican Cliff DeTemple of Jackson, a U.S. Coast Guard Reserve commander, filed nomination papers just before the deadline Monday. It was unclear whether he turned in enough valid nomination signatures to get on the ballot; state election officials were still reviewing them, and others submitted late Monday. If he did, DeTemple would face Fitzgerald in an August primary.

The prosecutor said checks by staff at the residential care home later revealed a string of missing items including one shoe, a necklace, stationery, a guitar amplifier, food, a face mask, sets of gloves, and bottles of hand sanitiser. She said due to hygiene reasons in the current coronavirus situation, the groceries found in the defendant's bags could not be returned to Caemaen.
 When searched, Willock was found to be in possession of a small quantity of cannabis resin.
 Willock, of Heol Gwyr, Llynhendy, Llanelli, had previously pleaded guilty to theft from a vehicle, one count of dwelling burglary, one count of non- dwelling burglary, and possession of cannabis when he appeared in the dock via videolink for sentencing.
 The court heard he has 15 previous convictions for 24 offences including 16 for theft and kindred matters, and one for a house burglary.
 James Hartson, defending Willock, said the only real mitigation he could put forward on his client's behalf was his early guilty pleas.
 He said the burglary of the residential home had been "very unsophisticated" in nature with the defendant randomly picking up items rather than, for example, targeting the store cupboards for personal protective equipment.

Former fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar has said that the Pakistan Super League is facing an economic crisis and some of the owners are looking to sell their teams.
 Appearing on a television show, Akhtar also claimed he doesn’t see the PSL taking place for the next 16 to 18 months.
 “I know some people wouldn’t like to hear this but some owners are looking to sell their franchisees. I would be more than happy to provide financial and non-monetary support to keep the PSL alive,” he said.
 The Pakistan Cricket Board had to suspend the fifth edition of the PSL in March this year due to the coronavirus pandemic with the final stage of the event remaining.
 The board was also forced to organise some matches in Karachi and Lahore before empty stadiums because of the virus, after the league was held completely for the first time in Pakistan since its launch in 2016.
 “I think if we do the math, the PSL can’t be held for another 16 to 18 months. The World Cup will also happen probably after eight months because time is needed for the coronavirus issue to settle down. The thing is if there is no proper cricket until say September, how can the PSL be held in four months? I don’t think the board can ask for money from the franchisees in this situation. As far as I know some franchises are already ready to sell their brand. They have offers,” said Akhtar.
 The former pacer claimed he will not allow the PSL to die and he will come forward with financial and other support to help save the T20 league. “I will make sure that the PSL thrives and stays alive and it gets big brands to make progress,” he said.
 Akhtar also didn’t agree with suggestions that the Board of Control for Cricket in India was working behind the scenes to get the World T20 Cup in Australia postponed and instead hold the Indian Premier League in its window in October-November.
 “I don’t think the ICC, Cricket Australia or BCCI can do anything about it. This decision will come from the Australian government. The policies of the Australian government will decide when the World T20 is held. And I know for the Australian government the health of their people is first without paying heed to other forces,” he said.
 Akhtar said the Australian government will not take decisions based on what the BCCI wants.
