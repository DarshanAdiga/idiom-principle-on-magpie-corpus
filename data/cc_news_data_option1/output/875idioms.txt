Back in 2002, I purchased an original Xbox. Although I already had a PlayStation 2 and Nintendo Gamecube at the time, the Xbox became my go-to system. If a game I wanted was available on multiple systems, I would always pick up the Xbox version.      Despite enjoying Xbox exclusives like the first two Halo games, when it came time to upgrade to a new system a few years later I went with the PlayStation 3 over the Xbox 360, and I really haven't had an overwhelming desire to return to the Xbox ecosystem since.      But Microsoft has slowly been winning me over.      It started with services like Xbox Game Pass, which cost $10 a month and gives you unlimited access to over 100 games, including all new Microsoft first- party titles the day they release.      Then earlier this week, Phil Harrison, the head of Xbox, posted a letter on Xbox.com giving a lot of new information on the upcoming Xbox Series X, and the machine sounds great.      Xbox Series X is going to be a beast of a home console. The new system, expected to launch this holiday season, will be powered by Microsoft's custom- designed processor featuring AMD's Zen 2 and RDNA 2 architectures. I'm not a PC gamer, so I don't know what that means, but Harrison wrote in his letter that the new system will have four times the processing power of an Xbox One and that its 12 TFLOPS of GPU is twice that of an Xbox One X and more than eight times the original Xbox One.      "Xbox Series X delivers a true generational leap in processing and graphics power with cutting edge techniques resulting in higher framerates, larger, more sophisticated game worlds, and an immersive experience unlike anything seen in console gaming," Harrison wrote in his letter.      Its SSD hard drive will allow for game worlds that are larger, more dynamic and load much faster than the current systems allow.      A new feature Harrison announced that sounds exciting to me is the new Quick Resume. The new system will let you suspend multiple games at one time, turn your system off and then return to them later almost instantly without having to wait through long loading screens.      Harrison also talked about Xbox's commitment to games and gamers. All Xbox One games will be compatible with Xbox Series X, as will a large number of original Xbox and Xbox 360 titles, all them with faster load times, steadier frame rates and sharper graphics because of the increased power in the Series X.      He also touted Microsoft's new Smart Delivery technology, in which a gamer will be able to buy certain games, all first-party Microsoft titles and some third-party titles, once and it will be optimized for whatever system you're playing it on.      Not long after Xbox released all the new details on the Series X, game developer CD Projekt Red announced its upcoming "Cyberpunk 2077" will take advantage of Smart Delivery.      Now is all of that enough for me to leave the PlayStation nation and jump ship to Xbox?      I'm pretty well tied into the PlayStation platform. The Uncharted series is probably my favorite franchise in gaming, so it would be difficult for me to switch sides and pick up an Xbox Series X over a PlayStation 5.      That being said, Microsoft is making some great decisions with the Xbox Series X, and everything they announced this week sounds terrific. A week ago I was 100% getting a PlayStation 5 this holiday season. While I am still very much leaning in that direction, Microsoft has swayed me some and given me something else to consider.

Technical chart claims that KeyCorp (KEY) would settle between $17.34/share to $17.71/share level. However, if the stock price goes below the $16.24 mark, then the market for KeyCorp becomes much weaker. If that happens, the stock price might even plunge as low as $15.51 for its downside target. The stock is currently in the red zone of MACD, with the indicator reading -1.3. Traders are always alerted for the move of a stock above or below the zero line due to the fact that the reading is an indicator of the position of the short-term average relative to the long-term average. If the MACD is above the zero line, then the short-term average relative is above that of the long-term average, thus implying an upward momentum. Vice versa is the case if the MACD is below the zero line.

"It is not unreasonable to have a few days' extra worth of food because if you fall ill, nobody really wants to go out to shop, you'd rather be recovering at home," he said. "But to go out at this time to quickly stock up one month of food is not what I would recommend at this time because it will do more harm to everyday life at this time."

The final thing that's been simplified is what you can do within your chats. The picture and voice message options remain intact, but you're no longer able to play games with your contacts. When you pull up the + sign, your options include sending GIFs, sending money, or sharing your location. The former two are some of the few things separating the new Messenger app from WhatsApp, to which it bears a resemblance, as my colleague Napier noticed.

JUPITER, Fla. — After a years-long chase, Kolten Wong finally secured his first Gold Glove as the Cardinals second baseman in 2019. Wong was an elite defender even before he was handed the hardware that acknowledged it, but Gold Glove voting is a tricky business.
 It doesn’t make it right, but sometimes it seems like a guy has to have a great season offensively in order to garner consideration for the defensive award. Regardless of what specifically elevated Wong to his deserved consideration a year ago, it happened. So this year, his Gold Glove aspirations revolve around a thirst for more.
 Wong’s not just chasing the hardware—he’s defending his. With, yuh know, more high-quality defense.

The coaches for the Junior All-Stars have not yet been announced.
 The Junior All-Stars will play one game against the Kentucky Junior All-Stars, tentatively set for June 1 at an Indiana site. The Junior All-Stars also will play one game against the Indiana All-Star senior girls on June 3, also at a site to be announced. Both games will be doubleheaders with the 2020 Indiana boys Junior All-Stars, who will be chosen in late March.
 The players listed as core group players will play in two games each. The players listed in the Red and Blue groups each will play in one game, the assignment for specific games to be announced.
 The Indiana senior All-Stars will play the Kentucky senior All-Stars on June 5 at a site in Kentucky that has not yet been announced. The Indiana senior All- Stars will play Kentucky’s seniors again on June 6 in Southport Fieldhouse in Indianapolis. The senior game in Indianapolis has been moved to Southport for 2020 because Bankers Life Fieldhouse will be undergoing renovations and not be available in June.
 The Junior All-Star team is determined by the 20-member Indiana Basketball Coaches Association all-state panel in conjunction with its selection of the IBCA/Subway Underclass All-State Team. The selection process allows all IBCA- member head coaches to nominate players through the IBCA all-state process. Representatives from 16 regional areas from across the state, three district representatives from the three IHSAA districts (one each from District 1, District 2 and District 3) and the committee chair then meet to review the nominations, vote and finalize the selections.
 The IBCA/Subway girls basketball Senior All-State and Underclass All-State teams will be released later this week.

RALEIGH, N.C. (WNCN) - As North Carolina continues to prepare for the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, the NC State Laboratory of Public Health (NCSLPH) within the NC Department of Health and Human Services is now able to perform testing for the virus. This new capability allows North Carolina to more quickly take public health steps to respond to any positive test result.“Testing is already underway in our state lab and that means we get results faster,” said Governor Roy Cooper. “Our public health leaders have been working around the clock to ensure that we are prepared.”At the time of this report, there were no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in North Carolina. Hours later, health officials announced the first confirmed case.Testing at NCSLPH will continue to be coordinated through the Division of Public Health’s Communicable Disease Branch on specimens from individuals who meet the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s criteria for a person under investigation for COVID-19. North Carolina is using the CDC developed test kit that was granted under an Emergency Use Authorization from the Food and Drug Administration.Per FDA requirements, test results from NCSLPH and other state labs require confirmation from the CDC. However, a presumptive positive from NCSLPH will initiate an immediate public health response from NCDHHS, NC Emergency Management and the appropriate local health department and hospital while CDC confirmation is pending.Commercial and private labs may quickly follow in their ability to perform testing for COVID-19, according to the CDC. Because COVID-19 is a reportable disease in North Carolina, all health care providers and labs are required to inform NCDHHS of testing for the virus so the appropriate public health response can be coordinated for a positive test.The CDC has indicated that Americans should be anticipating and preparing for the possibility of widespread COVID-19 in the United States. Since late January, NCDHHS and NC Emergency Management have been operating a team to coordinate efforts around the state’s response. In early February, Governor Cooper formalized this effort with the creation of the COVID-19 Task Force.NCDHHS and NCEM are working closely with local health departments, health care providers and others to quickly identify and respond to any potential isolated cases that might occur in the state and prepare North Carolinians to be ready in the event of more widespread, national COVID-19 transmission. The task force is developing response plans that address a range of possible scenarios. NCDHHS continues to host regular calls with local health providers and partners, develop and disseminate information and guidance and respond to questions from providers and communities.Copyright 2020 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc.
