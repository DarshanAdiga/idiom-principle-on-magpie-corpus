The next-generation 5G would start to become the norm in the mobile broadband space in next two-three years. ''As world settles down on 5G space, pricing of the equipment comes down and importantly the devices start getting available in plentiful, I think India in two-three years' time will be ready to receive the benefit of the investments that the globe would have made on 5G standard and 5G ecosystems,'' Mittal said. Mittal said he is upbeat about Bharti Enterprises' entry into space, which is the ''next frontier of communications''. ''PM has shown tremendous foresight in putting out a consultation paper to invite private sector into space industry to launch satellites, to manufacture satellites, to start satellite communications and I am glad, we have taken an early call in partnership with British Government to set up world's first LEO (low Earth orbit) constellation satellite system to provide broadband connectivity to every square inch of the world,'' he said.

The 49ers couldn’t get it done against Buffalo, although they wouldn’t use the unusual circumstances as an alibi.
 “No excuses. This is the NFL,” running back Jeff Wilson Jr. said. “We all know what’s at stake. We all know what we have to do and we didn’t get it done. We are professionals.”
 A defense that looked so dominant a week ago in a win against the Los Angeles Rams was picked apart by Allen. Mullens made a few too many mistakes, preventing San Francisco from moving into a three-way tie with Minnesota and Arizona for the final NFC wild card.
 This game turned on a few key sequences in the second half. San Francisco was in position to make a rare defensive stop when Kentavius Street needlessly shoved Allen late for a roughing-the-passer penalty that helped set up a 23-yard TD pass to Isaiah McKenzie against a blown coverage, making it 24-10.
 “It felt like they were calling the perfect plays for everything we were dialing up,” linebacker Fred Warner said. “They did a great job on their end. We were trying different looks and different calls and we just couldn’t get off the field.”
 Two plays later, Mullens’ pass deflected off receiver Brandon Aiyuk’s hands for an interception by Micah Hyde that set up a field goal that made it 27-10.

A year ago I began taking an antidepressant, around that same time I started on a journey to try and better myself and my life. My husband was in Chicago visiting out Grandbabies and I was driving home from a store and realized that if we moved back to Chicago there would be a high probability that we would live far enough away that I would need to drive on a highway to be able to get to the grandkids house quickly. I decided to see if I could make a small drive, only the length of 2 exits and then I would get off. I gave myself a peep talk, envisioned my grandkids faces on the cars in front of me and merged into traffic. No racing heart, no sweaty palms no spinning in my head and fast talking trying to figure out an escape plan. I was apprehension and cautious, but I was doing it! I made it the length of one exit and continued, thinking the panic attack would hit soon, but it did not! I drove about 5 miles away from the house that day and quickly called my husband when I got off to tell him of my new achievement! I was using the thought of being able to visit my grandbabies sooner as motivation to do something that was very scary, and my antidepressant was doing its job and working as an anxiety medication as well. Over the course of the last year I have taken the highway sometimes and decided to use side streets if I was feeling uncomfortable. I have driven on unfamiliar highways in other States without issue. As time passes by uncomfortable locations on familiar highways that used trigger me have now become almost natural to drive.

We ended our trip early and returned home the following day. I never drove comfortably on the highway again after that day. I do not give up easily, so I continued trying to overcome this fear, but the response was now immediate for me. I felt like out of control and overwhelmed regardless of who was driving. I wanted to be in control of driving, but not only in control of my own car, but of every car around me. I wasted years of my life refusing to go places if it involved highway driving, or I would take alternate routes that took 3 hours to get someplace that I could have got to in an hour on the highway. The fear was crippling yet I became resigned to the fact that I would never be capable of long- distance highway driving again.

We had ventured off to visit my husbands Grandma and other extended family that day, they were in Cuernavaca, a town located about 75 minutes away from where we were staying in Mexico City. Jesus, my FIL, was the driver because he lives in Mexico City, knows his way around the city, owns the car and is a control freak. Unbeknownst to us, it became apparent that he had been drinking before we left, and from the way he drove that day I am going to assume it was a lot or he was practicing to audition for a Fast and Furious movie. The harrowing experience began with us ascending into the Mountains via a 2-lane road loaded with tight turns. Jesus the race car driver put the peddle to the medal as quickly as traffic would allow. His 18 yr. old daughter in the front seat beside him, cheering him on the entire time, squealing “ooooo, Papi, faster” while clapping her hands! Our tortuous excursion getting worse with each passing mile. Serpentine roads with no guardrails greeted us as the speed of the car continued to accelerate. Jesus did not seem to hear my husband’s pleas to please slow down or the grunts and moans I could not keep buried inside my gut. The hairpin turns sans guardrails is what caused me to lose complete control of my bladder, as Jesus proudly pumped his chest out while slurring how manly he was.

I was not always fearful of driving on the highway. When I learned how to drive at the age of 16, I had no issues. I moved from Chicago to Las Vegas in 2000 and drove the entire way. 1800 miles of numerous types of traffic in different States and I did not suffer from a panic attack once. In fact, I enjoyed the long drives, listening to music, talking about everything under the sun with my husband, playing games of “I Spy” and making plans of our future together. Driving became hypnotic and relaxing and the miles passed by quickly, we were there before we knew it. I drove back and forth from these two States several times and many places in between yet the rides from hell never entered my mind for over 20 years. I believe the event that introduced these mini episodes of terror to my mind was a trip to Mexico City, and a drive I will never forget, with my Father in Law.

A comprehensive report into the 2019 Christchurch mosque shootings in which 51 Muslim worshippers died sheds new light on how the gunman was able to elude detection by authorities as he planned his attack. The nearly 800-page Royal Commission of Inquiry report released on Tuesday shows the attacker, Brenton Tarrant, kept a low profile and told nobody of his plans.It concludes that despite the shortcomings of various agencies, there were no clear signs the attack was imminent — aside from the manifesto Tarrant sent out just eight minutes before he began shooting, which came too late for agencies to respond.But the report does detail failings in the police system for vetting gun licenses, and says New Zealand&rsquo;s intelligence agencies were focused on the threat posed by Islamic extremism rather than white supremacists.Among 44 recommendations, the report says the government should establish a new national intelligence agency. New Zealand currently has one intelligence agency that focuses on domestic threats and one that focuses on international threats. Often those agencies are focused on immediate events like keeping visiting dignitaries safe. The report recommends establishing a new, well-financed intelligence and security agency that is more strategic in nature and can focus on emerging threats and developing a counter-terrorism strategy.New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the government had agreed to implement all of the recommendations and apologized for agency shortcomings.Tarrant, who is Australian, was sentenced in August to life in prison without the possibility of parole after pleading guilty to 92 counts of terrorism, murder and attempted murder.The report details the extensive world travels of Tarrant but also shows he had almost no meaningful interactions with people in New Zealand because he was introverted and did not work.As a child, Tarrant had unsupervised access to the internet and became interested in video games from the age of six or seven, the report says. He began expressing racist ideas from a young age and told his mother he started using the 4chan internet forum from age 14.He put on a lot of weight as a teenager before starting to exercise compulsively at gyms and going on a diet, losing about 110 pounds. His father Rodney was diagnosed with lung cancer caused by exposure to asbestos and in 2010 killed himself at home, leaving an inheritance of 457,000 Australian dollars (£253,000) to Tarrant.The gunman worked for about three years as a personal trainer at a gym in the Australian town of Grafton, but stopped working after an injury and then used his inheritance to live and travel to dozens of countries. He moved to New Zealand in 2017 and focused on planning for his attack. The report said he only had superficial interactions with people at a gym and the rifle club where he practiced rapid-fire shooting. Yet when needed, Tarrant could present himself to others in a way that did not arouse suspicion.Tarrant told investigators that although he frequented extreme right-wing discussion boards on websites like 4chan and 8chan, he found YouTube a far more significant source of information and inspiration.Ms Ardern said she planned to speak to leaders at YouTube &ldquo;directly&rdquo; about how the gunman had become inspired by videos on the site.As part of the process for acquiring a gun licence, Tarrant was required to provide to police the names of two referees who could speak to his good character. He gave them the name of a friend he knew mostly online from gaming together, along with that friend&rsquo;s father. Vetting officers interviewed Tarrant and the referees, and recommended he be given his license.Police Commissioner Andrew Coster said the force &ldquo;could have done more to consider whether the two referees knew the individual well enough to serve as referees&rdquo;.The report also found the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service, the domestic spying agency, had chosen to concentrate scarce counter-terrorism resources on the threat of Islamist extremist terrorism inspired by groups like Islamic State at the expense of other threats.Despite the shortcomings of various agencies, the report concludes, there was no plausible way Tarrant&rsquo;s plans could been detected &ldquo;except by chance&rdquo;.
