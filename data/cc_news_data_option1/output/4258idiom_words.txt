Fort McMurray-born actress Alyssa Wapanatahk, 22, has been cast as Tiger Lily in Disney's upcoming live-action film, "Peter Pan & Wendy."
 The news was first announced by _TheWrap.com_ on Oct. 16 and confirmed by Wapanatahk on her social media accounts. She has not yet been made available for interviews.
 Wapanatahk joins a cast that includes Jude Law as Captain Hook, Yara Shahidi as Tinker Bell, Ever Anderson as Wendy and Alexander Molony as Peter Pan.
 According to Wapanatâhk’s website, she is a member of the Bigstone Cree First Nation near Wabasca. She was born in Fort McMurray and went to school in the city between grades two and eight.
 However, much of her upbringing was in Conklin and she often spent holidays and weekends in the hamlet. She also describes going to nearby First Nations, Janvier and Fort Chipewyan for snow drags and cultural days.
 "It is so beautiful there and I can talk about that place forever," she wrote about Conklin.
 Earlier this month, the actress announced on her Instagram page she recently changed her name to Wapanatahk, the Cree name she was born with that translates to "first star in the sky" or "morning star." Her family name is Alook. The change is part of her efforts to understand and promote the Cree language and culture.
 This is Wapanatahk's first feature film role, as much of her previous work has been in short films. Last year, she was selected to create a short film with the Indigenous Storyteller program through Storyhive, a Telus-funded program focusing on independent filmmakers in Alberta and B.C.
 The $20,000 grant led to "I believe that now people are starting to listen to Indigenous peoples' stories and given the opportunity we can help each other heal and teach something to those who don't know what we experience," she told the _Edmonton Journal_ after she was awarded the grant. "I really hope that I can reach the young people of the next generation that go through these experiences as a boy having braids growing up in modern day society."
 A release date for the film has yet to be scheduled. It is also unknown if the film will be shown in theatres, streamed exclusively on Disney+, or some combination of the two.

This is the first time that Nora has collaborated with Guru on a music video, and she said of the experience: "What's really cool is that when I see the video, I notice that Guru (Randhawa) has come out of his shell. You can see the kind of energy and the kind of conviction he has in terms of his swag, movements and presence on screen. I am really happy with that and I think that was all because I hyped him up from behind the camera! It was really nice working with him for the first time."
