Guam Department of Education Superintendent Jon Fernandez said he hopes to provide more information in the next couple days on the status of schools after Gov. Lou Leon Guerrero extended the closure of all public and private schools through April 13.
 There are many proposed ideas, according to the superintendent.
 Information circulated among teachers indicated the possibility of closing schools for the remainder of the school year.
 Fernandez warned against sharing partial or incorrect information at this time but did not deny outright that school closures for the rest of the year was under consideration.
 "When we make a determination regarding any of the info above, we will officially share what those decisions are. Until then, a lot of brainstorming and discussion is taking place and we are getting input from administrators and teachers alike," Fernandez said.
 If schools are closed for the rest of the year, that wouldn't be a major departure from what has been done in other jurisdictions in light of COVID-19.
 Guam's neighbor, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, announced Monday that classes will be suspended for the rest of the 2019-2020 school year. Student instructional services would be performed online or through the CNMI Public School System Distance Learning Program, according to a PSS memo.
 Isa Baza, GDOE spokeswoman, has said the department is working with stakeholders, including the Guam Federation of Teachers and student leaders, to determine the best course of action with teaching and learning should schools remain closed.
 "Our discussions involve concepts such as how students will be graded through the end of the year and how content and activities can be delivered to students during closures," Baza said.
 To that extent, the Island-wide School Board of Governing Students also launched a survey asking peers how they preferred to be graded if the school year were to end early.

On the heels of Gov. Jared Polis asking that evictions be halted for people who can't pay their monthly rent as the state and country grapples with the impacts from the coronavirus, local officials are in the process of working on such a plan.
   
 "The courts and the district attorney and our office need to get together and build that system and see how that is going to effectively be done," said Pueblo County Sheriff Kirk Taylor, whose department conducts eviction proceedings in Pueblo and Pueblo County.
   
 Taylor said officials have been meeting to discuss a plan to stop evictions temporarily, and that he believes they will have some indication as to what direction they will go sometime this week.
   
 He said he supports temporarily halting evictions as individuals and families suddenly out of work from the business shutdowns the coronavirus has prompted could struggle to making payments to stay in their housing.
   
 But there's a lot to figure out, and meetings have been taking place on a near daily basis to formulate a plan.
   
 "We already have some evictions that are in the pipeline currently that we're working on, and so how do we halt those and then what does that look like?" Taylor said. "How many days, those kinds of things are questions. We'll get some information from the state on what their thoughts are exactly and see if and when we're going to implement it here in Pueblo."
   
 Taylor said the time frame is the trickiest part of the decision making process right now.
   
 "Because that's the big unknown, we don't know how long this is going to go on," he said. "So how long are you going to suspend them, and when are you going to pick them up again? And then when you pick them up again you're going to have a big backlog so how are you doing to deal with that? Is that going to take additional resources to catch up? Are we just going to let it play out? There are a lot of unanswered questions."
   
 Polis has urged law enforcement in Colorado not to devote resources to evictions and rather focus on more pressing matters. He asked that evictions be held off until at least April 30 and that landlords cease imposing late fees on tenants until that time as well.
   
 Tallie Koncilja manages eight properties in Pueblo she rents for both commercial and residential purposes.
   
 She said on Monday that she is fine with following Polis' guidelines for temporarily stopping evictions, and that she doesn't impose late fees on tenants anyway.
   
 "I think April is going to be OK," she said. "I think it's going to get tough for a lot of people in the month of May."
   
 Koncilja also said there are some measures she hopes the county and city of Pueblo consider to help in the meantime.
   
 "I wish the county would not instill any additional fees on your property taxes, any interest," she said. "That would be a somewhat easy fix I think for them to do away with immediately is give us a break by not making us pay the interest."
   
 Koncilja said she also hopes the city considers at least suspending its monthly street repair utility fee as it gets costly each month for the properties she manages.
   
 "It would help me tremendously," she said.

Over the past few days, the most used social media platforms across the world are working round the clock to combat the wave of false reports, fake videos and falsities that have spread across countries as they threaten to disrupt all efforts to inform & prepare people on ways to deal with this global pandemic.
 So while panic and fear continues to mount around the coronavirus outbreak, the spread of false information has been rapid. These forwards or messages cannot just be categorized as annoying spam. It can be very dangerous. Therefore CNBC-TV18's Startup Street team decided to focus on players who are working relentlessly to debunk some of the most circulated COVID-19 messages, misinformation and false stories that we encounter on a daily basis on social media as well as mainstream media.
 One such startup is Alt News. Megha Vishwanath spoke to Pratik Sinha Co- Founder of Alt News, Berges Malu Dir - Public Policy at ShareChat and Aakrit Vaish Co-Founder & CEO of Haptik to decode the fake news menace.
 Moreover, now with most people across the country confined to their homes, usage of books, comics and gaming apps have skyrocketed. Mobile browsing app activity too has surged by nearly 40 percent, this according to a report by Bengaluru based In-Mobi Group, titled 'COVID-19 Consumer Insights: India'.
 The report has analysed aggregated data signals from the first week of January to March 11 2020. To talk about the emerging trends in the report Megha Vishwanath also spoke to Vasuta Agarwal, MD - APAC at InMobi.

The global polyglycolic acid market has been analyzed based on expected demand. Market data for each segment is based on volume and corresponding revenue. Prices considered for calculation of revenue are average regional prices obtained through primary quotes from regional suppliers, distributors, and direct selling regional producers based on manufacturer feedback and application requirement. Country segmentations of Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and the Middle East & Africa have been depicted in kilo grams and US$ thousand due to limited size of the market. The market scenario in North America and Europe has been forecast in tons and US$ Mn. We have used the bottom-up approach to estimate the global polyglycolic acid market, split by regions. The application split of the market has been derived using the top- down approach for each regional market separately with the global product segment split being an integration of regional estimates. Kureha Corporation is the sole commercial-scale manufacturer of PGA in the world; hence, global demand is a function of marketability of PGA products from Kureha Corporation. A conservative approach has been adopted in this study to estimate demand for PGA in light of the information available pertaining to Kureha Corporation\'s scale of operations. Companies were considered for the market share analysis based on their product portfolio, revenue, and manufacturing capacity. The polyglycolic acid market for medical applications is unorganized; few companies manufacture PGA in limited quantities.

An update on the district’s response to the coronavirus outbreak was provided at the March 23 school board meeting, along with a report on how the pandemic is affecting progress on referendum projects.
 Runez said school officials will look to gather feedback from staff and parents on the virtual learning system later this week to help the district improve the practice and the experience for students and educators.
 Director of Instruction Rebecca Toetz reported to the board that she’s received only positive responses from those she’s spoken with.
 An online form and help desk are providing support for families. Toetz described the teamwork to get virtual learning up and running as “unbelievable” and added, “I couldn’t be more pleased.”
 Runez credited Toetz and Kim Bannigan, learning information systems coordinator for the district, for their work in setting it up.
 “It was nothing short of moving a mountain to get it done,” said Runez.
 In addressing the matter of facilitating access to the Internet for all students and staff, Bannigan contacted Verizon about acquiring hot spots to be given out to them. Bannigan said the district was able to get 100 devices. About half have been handed out already. As the week progresses, Bannigan said she expects more to be provided.
 “I think we’ll have enough to cover,” said Bannigan. “If we need more, we can get more.”

Despite public health officials’ best efforts to shift the local focus from testing to social distancing in the COVID-19 dialogue, more and more people are publicly questioning the dearth of tests for the novel virus in Pitkin County.
 One of those people is Dr. Ann Mass, an Aspen physician who specializes in internal medicine. On Sunday, she sent out an email to her entire patient base decrying county officials’ response to the pandemic and offering a potential solution, at least regarding testing.
 “I have tried to get our county government and health department engaged in setting up a drive-through testing station with tests sent to commercial labs but have been met with tremendous resistance, misinformation and inertia,” she wrote. “They say there are multiple reasons to NOT do it, though it is up and running in many places in the country. To that I say, ‘just do it.’”
 Mass pointed to Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, commonly known as LabCorp, as a private-sector partner that, as of this week, according to her email, is selling testing for $51.31 per test.
 “The testing station will not function perfectly. We may run out of [personal protective equipment] and testing supplies and have to suspend testing for a few days to restock. There will be glitches and kinks but we are a smart and motivated town and we can get it going,” she wrote. “I urge all of our patients to contact our local government and ask them to institute drive- through commercial testing.”
 The letter got the attention of the medical staff at Aspen Valley Hospital, who had a meeting already scheduled for Monday evening to discuss COVID-19 in general, and testing was among the agenda items, hospital CEO Dave Ressler said.
 “At the hospital, we are looking forward to an open dialogue with the physicians and between the physicians; however, I think it’s important to note this meeting was already scheduled,” he said, adding that it became an opportunity to discuss Mass’ proposal. “Dr. Mass is well respected in the medical community and in the community in general and deserves to be heard.”
 The meeting, which began at 6 p.m. Monday, will not influence policy, at least not officially. Mass declined to comment for this story until hearing the position of the medical community.
 “It was never intended to pressure the [Pitkin County Incident Management Team] one way or the other; they need to do what they need to do for the community,” Ressler said.
 Pitkin County Public Health Director Karen Koenemann did not return a call Monday, but several county commissioners empathized with the frustration felt in the community while finding reasons for optimism moving forward.
 “I’ve known Dr. Mass for 40 years; I’ve worked for her at different times at different levels,” Commissioner Patti Clapper said. “She’s a very, very smart woman, and I understand her frustration. Everybody, from every angle is frustrated with how we can get done what we need to get done.”
 Balancing the urgency of mitigating the spread of COVID-19 and also the importance of implementing a plan rooted in expertise is a sticking point, she acknowledged.
 “We don’t want to be in a holding pattern because we want to get something done, but when we do it, we want to make sure we get it done and get it done right,” she said.
 She and Commissioner Greg Poschman both shared concerns around the misinformation coming out of the rapidly changing situation.
 “The community is so concerned; they’re seeing what other communities are doing and they’re going ‘what’s going on here? Why not us?’ We have a team that’s been working on this for weeks, but I know they’re also in a state of whelm if not overwhelm and exhaustion,” he said.
 “We’ve been talking about more transparent communications … so everybody feels more confident about what’s going on. The message is slow to come out, but the rumor mill is churning at light speed out there.”
 That’s all Max Ben-Hamoo is asking. Ben-Hamoo waited 11 days to definitely learn that his test for COVID-19 was negative. During that time, while he eventually got phone calls from the county updating him that his results were still pending, he and everyone with whom he had been in contact were waiting “on pins and needles,” he said.
 “I’ve been stuck in the middle of this very frustrating situation that I know a lot of people have been kind of caught in,” he said.
 Ben-Hamoo was prescreened through the local coronavirus hotline and recommended for testing at the temporary site the IMT set up last week before that operation was shut down. He was told he would likely have his results in 24 hours but they could take as long as three or four days, he recounted.
 “Basically, after the weekend, you should definitely have your results,” he said, noting he was tested on Thursday, March 12. “Until that point, go and assume you have it. Go and quarantine. So I went and did that. Two days go by, nothing. Four days, nothing. Six days go by, and I finally get a phone call from them [updating that my results were still pending].”
 In that time, “word had gotten out” that Ben-Hamoo, who works in the service industry and thus had interacted with dozens of people, was symptomatic and awaiting test results.
 “I was just waiting in limbo, then all the people around me started to stress. Every morning, I woke up to 15 texts. Naturally, the collective stress of it just started getting more and more intense,” he said. “I just kind of kept waiting on pins and needles and becoming very anxious. Do they even have my test? Did it get lost? Am I just getting the runaround?”
 When his test finally did come back negative, it simply confirmed what he had already suspected: that he in fact just had a sinus infection. But although he’d reached out to his doctor about treatment for the infection, Ben-Hamoo couldn’t come into the doctor’s office until he had his results.
 It was the not knowing and lack of answers to his questions that were the worst aspects of the ordeal, he said.
 “It feeds into the psychological freakout that people are having. If you have 10 people stuck in the cycle, each of those 10 people probably have at least 10 people they’re talking to. Instead of some answers to bring comfort to the situation, it’s just a bunch of question marks,” he said.

The Blue Yeti mic has been around for years, and there's a reason it's so popular: It does the job. I have a Blue Yeti on my desk, and I've used it to speak to audiences around the world, as well as in phone meetings and teleconferences.
 This kit solves a problem I had for a long time. I bought the Blue Yeti on a stand, but it wound up blocking my monitor all the time. A good extended arm will move the mic out of your way until you need it and then position it just perfect for a quality broadcast.
 I also recommend you spend the extra ten bucks and get a pop filter. Don't get one of those foam mic covers. They won't prevent the popping that you're going to generate in conference calls. But a pop filter, placed just in front of the mic, will clear up those sound problems once and for all.

Tim Cousino didn't get to play on the same baseball team with his older brothers when he was growing up.
 The 57-year-old Monroe man is three years younger than his brother Craig and six years younger than Mike.
 Craig and Mike were playing with boys their own age.
 Tim was left behind.
 But for a few glorious days last month, the Brothers Cousino were united.
 All three attended the Detroit Tigers fantasy camp in Lakeland, Fla.
 "All three brothers were on the same team," Tim said. "My brother Mike is a catcher. I always wanted to pitch to him. … It was really cool. We had a great time."
 Mike, who lives in Texas, is a veteran of Tiger fantasy camps. This was the fifth time the Monroe Catholic Central graduate has participated.
 "Mainly, it's just being part of a team and playing baseball, kind of like when you were a kid - even though you're not a kid anymore," the 63-year-old said. "It's fun. You interact with some Tiger players you watched growing up or even as an adult. You get to hang out with them and hear their stories."
 Mike convinced Craig, a 60-year-old Monroe High graduate who lives in North Carolina, to join him at the camp a few years ago.
 "All we did growing up was play baseball all summer long," he said. "You go back to your 10 and 12-year-old brains with a 60-year-old body. You brain tells you can do it and your body tells you, 'No you can't.'"
 Mike and Craig had so much fun attending the camp together that they decided to bring Tim along.
 They hatched a plan to give their little brother a gift he would never forget.
 During a celebration of Tim's birthday last April in North Carolina, Mike and Craig pulled out some photos of their trip to the fantasy camp.
 In one of the photos, there were three Cousinos instead of two.
 "They had superimposed me into one of the photos with them," Tim said. "They said, 'Hey, check out this picture.' I didn't realize it at first. I said, 'Hey, somebody's got my number.' They started laughing. I said, 'No way!'"
 And the brothers could not make the trip without their biggest fan.
 Mike and Craig also paid for their 84-year-old mother, Theresa Durbin-Shaw of Monroe, to make the trip to Lakeland.
 "She's the reason we go," Craig said. "We took her when I went the last time and she said it was the best vacation she ever had."
 "She's a huge Tiger fan," Mike added. "She remembers all the old players. That's her thing. She loves Tiger baseball."
 And the Tigers became a fan of her.
 "Those guys all call me Mother Theresa," she said. "They all remember my name. They are all so nice. ... This is the first year that Brandon Inge was there. That made it even better. He's my favorite. He's the best third baseman I ever saw."
 Durbin-Shaw knew months ahead of time that Mike and Craig planned to surprise Tim with the trip. She had to keep the secret.
 But the boys had another secret.
 "I didn't know they were going to send me, too," she said. "They said, 'Mom, we can't go without you.'"
 Tim knew he needed to get in shape before heading to Florida.
 "I started three weeks before we went down," he said. "I went to the (Monroe Family YMCA) and worked with a personal trainer. And I hit in the batting cages."
 The Cousino brothers were on a team coached by former Tiger pitcher Nate Robertson and outfielder turned television broadcaster Craig Monroe.
 The team went 3-3 in its six games, which wasn't bad considering they had the oldest team there.
 "We were all older guys," said Tim, who works for the Monroe County Mental Health Department. "The team with the 19 and 20-year-olds had the pitching. We had two guys who were 40, but the rest were all over 50. We still did pretty good. We came in fourth (out of 10 teams)."
 But winning and losing isn't the bottom line at a fantasy camp.
 Tim got to live a dream. He was the starting pitcher in the opening game and Mike was his catcher.
 He also did some damage with the bat.
 "I got some pretty good hits," he said. "I had two game-winning hits."
 Being half of a Cousino-Cousino battery was the highlight for Mike.
 "Was looking forward to catching Tim," he said. "I never really played with him on a team. And my brother Craig is just fun to hang around."
 Craig had a humorous take on his camp highlight.
 "I stretched a double into a single in the first game," he said. "I got yelled at by Craig Monroe. He said, 'How come you didn't get to second.' I said, 'I looked at second you hadn't moved that runner to third yet.'"
 The family generated a lifetime of memories in a few days.
 "It was fun to see our names on the back of the shirts," Craig said. "That was good."
 "It's a great vacation," Mike added. "You are completely detached. When you're playing baseball, you're not checking your cell phone. You can't.
 "I was talking to my wife on the way over to Florida. I told her I was trying to think of the last time we played baseball together. It's probably been 45 years. Even though we're slow, we can't run and we can't throw like we used to, it was fun to play together."
 There is a fourth brother in the Cousino clan - 62-year-old Dave.
 Mike claims he's retiring from fantasy camps, but he would not rule out a comeback if Dave could be convinced to make it a Cousino quartet.
 "Maybe next year," he said. "Who knows?"

Disease comes with stigma. That’s nothing new and the same applies to COVID-19. I’ve seen this unfolding in real time. From the president changing the words on his briefing paper from “coronavirus” to “Chinese virus” to local apathy and anger toward each other, the stigma of disease is alive and well.
 On Monday, the New York Times chronicled epidemics that date back to earlier than 400 B.C. These include cholera, smallpox, typhus, swine flu, avian flu, Spanish Flu, Hong Kong Flu, leprosy, measles, malaria, AIDS, SARS, MERS, etc.
 Stigma and prejudice follows these scary titles around. In 1968 a billboard in Des Moines, Iowa read, “HONG KONG FLU IS UNAMERICAN! Catch Something Made in the U.S.A.”
 AIDS was pinned on the homosexual community but is still with us and is still stigmatized in many countries by many people. More than 32 million people were claimed by AIDS and almost 38 million are living with the disease today thanks to new therapies.
 Ebola? Deadly, highly contagious and stigmatized.
 On Sunday, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis held a press briefing that was explicit, honest, urgent, scientific and data-driven. I encourage all Coloradans to find it online and follow the guidelines outlined by the governor. His directives are extreme. The virus threatens to overwhelm the state and country. He argues that this calls for an urgent response from everyone.
 Like Polis explained, no one cares for you, your loved ones or your friends more than you do, so voluntary participation on distancing directives depends on the individual. No police are going to lock people up for kissing in the park or getting too close. We are self-policing. What we do now will make a big difference in what we can do later. And to who lives or dies.
 I just got back from a trip to Mexico. I was on a plane that was about three- quarters full and we were seated next to a woman who was coughing about every two minutes. We asked to be moved, not because we didn’t respect her and wish her well, but because we were seated in her personal blast zone. She obviously felt stigmatized, which is regrettable. But we moved anyway.
 I was surprised that at both DIA and the airport in Cancun that there was no attempt at determining who was safe to fly or who was coming in hot. We did see a couple of medics suited up near the security checkpoint in Cancun. They had some kind of exotic thermometer but they were not looking at anyone coming through. I did see a young tourist woman wearing a T-shirt with the Corona beer logo with the word “virus” emblazoned under it.
 At DIA there were no resources on hand to see if anyone was running hot. People were being fed through customs as quickly as possible. It’s understandable. The airports can’t afford to manage the cases of thousands of people coming in when there is no viable testing available. Folks are already on their way home and being told to self-quarantine. It’s the best we can do at this point.
 There’s a website developed by an American teenager that compiles worldwide data on the spread of the virus. As of this writing, (Monday, March 23, 2020 at 1 p.m.) there were 363,470 confirmed cases worldwide, 16,093 deceased, 10,718 serious cases and 99,792 total recovered. One-hundred-seventy-three of 195 total countries have cases. The website also breaks down data by countries and states, and Colorado was listing 591 known infections and seven deaths.
 Of course, these are only the cases that have been reported. Tests are still hard to get so the numbers of the infected and recovered will never really be known. There’s no simple, accessible test to see if you’ve had it or you have it. In Pitkin County, widespread public testing had to be suspended in order to direct resources to those who were coming to the hospital for treatment.
 The lack of reliable data is one of our country’s biggest shortfalls. If authorities don’t know who’s got it and where it’s going, it’s going to be hard to react and attack concisely. That’s why we are seeing entire states like California being locked down. We are flying blind.
 I appreciate Colorado’s official response. In light of a national effort that is considered by some experts to be rudderless and clueless, it’s impressive to see dedicated adults, doctors and scientists doing the best they can with the little they’ve got, right here in our state.
 Polis was lamenting that Colorado’s hospitals were expecting to be short of up to 7,000 ventilators and thousands of medical masks when the expected peak of the outbreak comes and his team is making efforts to address the shortage with local manufacturing.
 I live in a location where it’s easy to avoid contact with others. You might say that I’ve been training for this crisis, in my 200-square-foot cabin with no running water, conventional heat or television. I’ve become a prepper and didn’t even know it. Although I still don’t have any guns … shoot, I might have to change that.

For those who have worked on the Games, be it as part of the organizing committee or the crews who built venues, it has to feel as if someone has picked up the finish line and moved it out of sight. It will take hours and hours, detailed spreadsheets and a mind-numbing number of conference calls and meetings to reconfigure the plans and details that have been seven years in the making. That’s psychologically devastating, and physically draining.
