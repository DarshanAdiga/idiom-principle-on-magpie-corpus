One in five students say their mental health has significantly worsened during the coronavirus pandemic, according to a survey conducted in April by Active Minds, a mental health advocacy group focused on college students.
 Almost all of the 2,000 students surveyed said the virus had caused them stress or anxiety, and 80% said they had experienced loneliness or isolation because of it. Nearly half said that a major source of stress was the financial effect of the virus on them or their families.
 As the virus spread, young people shifted from talking about getting a degree, finding a job and falling in love to “pandemic anxiety,” said Boaz Gaon, founder of the mental-health-oriented social networking app Wisdo, which has 20,000 active college-age users. “They’ve developed sleeplessness,” Gaon said. “They’re looking for new friends, purpose in life.”
 Of course, most people are resilient, and sadness and anxiety are understandable reactions to this wrenching moment. “We don’t need to tell people they’re suffering from a mental health problem when they’re having an appropriate response to very challenging circumstances,” said Victor Schwartz, a psychiatrist with the Jed Foundation, who advises colleges on mental health issues.
