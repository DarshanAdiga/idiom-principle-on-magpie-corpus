The Dallas Cowboys are in the Houston Texans vs. Kansas City Chiefs NFL Sunday Night Football Game this Sunday. I have a ask for you Why? I am not systematic whether or not this is the right Game to root for my Texas Dallas Cowboys to win, I am in view of that interested as to why someone would choose this Game as all along subsidiary Game to watch. Or perhaps more importantly, why someone would choose to watch the NFL Sunday Ticket behind they could simply watch it vis-vis a alternating type of source? Why would you watch the Texans or Chiefs suit out this Game? For those that did not know, I am referring to our nations Proxy Providers. Proxy Services is a matter because they by yourself focus upon one sport; NFL Football.

The 71-year-old was sickened in March on a cruise from Australia with his wife, a break after decades of running the family's Chinese restaurant in Papillion, Neb. In the 74 days he was hospitalized, doctors desperately tried various experimental approaches, including enrolling him in a study of an antiviral drug that ultimately showed promise. Ming died on June 8. "It was just touch and go. Everything they wanted to try we said yes, do it," said his daughter, Anne Peterson. "We would give anything to have him back, but if what we and he went through would help future patients, that's what we want." (Lu Wang via AP)

PLYMOUTH - The name above the door entering Plymouth North's basketball courts states it's the Hank Rogers Gymnasium. It's been decades since Hank coached at the school but this week's 50-for-50 profile left a record of success in his 25 season on the bench that most likely won't be seen again.
 "Hank had a certain presence about him," said Doug Griswold, a Plymouth Athletic Hall of Fame member who started at center for two seasons for Rogers. "He could be tough as a coach, but you learned so much about basketball from him. He was focused on playing well and he expected his players to be the same way."
 High school sports is a cyclical animal. Players come in and out in four-year waves, which makes what Hank did in his 25 years (1951-1976) as head coach of the Plymouth boys basketball program that much more unbelievable.
 The numbers are truly eye-popping, including an overall record of 403-125 for the Plymouth Athletic Hall of Fame and Massachusetts Basketball Coaches Hall of Fame inductee. But that just scratches the surface on Hank's success as in 27 years coaching, including one year each in Maine and Michigan, as he never had a losing season. Not one.
 In 25 years of coaching in his hometown, Hank's team's not only never had less than a .500 record, many times they challenged for a state championship. The Blue Eagles won 21 league championships under his watch and qualified for the Eastern Massachusetts Tech Tourney an astounding 20 times.
 Plymouth was at the zenith of its success in the early 1960s, and former Plymouth North Principal Frank Rose was there in the middle of all the fun.
 "My sophomore year we lost in the state semifinals but we came back to win the Class C championship in my junior and senior years (1961 and 1962). But the program wasn't done, as we lost in the finals in '63 and then came back to win it again in '64," said Rose. "That was the golden age for boys basketball in the town of Plymouth. Hank was able to get us right to the top with the best teams in the state year after year."
 Rose said teams hated to come to Memorial Hall to take on Plymouth back then. The close confines of the old building and the rabid Eagle fan base helped give Plymouth "the ultimate home court advantage" remembered Rose.
 "There was no extra room around the basketball court, and the fans were crowded in all around you. Teams hated to play here but we loved it. It was huge help to us, because we knew all the ins and outs around the basketball court," Rose said. "The fan support at these games was out of this world, and Memorial Hall was the place that you wanted to be as a young basketball player. If you weren't in your seat at the start of the JV game on a Friday night against Silver Lake, then you weren't going to see the varsity game. That's how popular we were at that time."
 Former Plymouth North Head Coach Bill Drew came into the basketball program a couple of years after Rogers retired, but he clearly remembers the excitement of the Plymouth-Carver boys basketball games while growing up in town.
 "Hoop was king in this town when I was growing up. Everyone wanted to play in high school, and everyone wanted to play for Hank. The gym was packed for every home game, and Hank helped develop an incredible winning culture around the program over the years," Drew said. "It was amazing how he found ways to build on his success year after year. He was a tough, hard-nosed coach, but he knew what you had to do to play winning basketball."
 Hank's story is the story of hometown boy who made good. The son of Rodman and Helen Rogers, Hank played football, basketball and baseball in Plymouth before attending Admiral Billiard Academy for a year and then Boston University, where he earned a degree in Education.
 After college he entered the Naval Air Corps, where he was a navigator during World War II. He eventually made his way back to Plymouth where he began cementing his legacy as a physical education teacher and a coach of basketball, cross country and track and field.
 Rose, Griswold and former Plymouth South Middle School principal John Siever all sat under the learning tree of Hank, first as a player and later as a contemporary and a fellow educator.
 "Hank was actually my Little League baseball coach at Stephens Field when I young. I knew he was the high school basketball coach but I had no idea back then about what an icon he was. But when I got to high school I quickly discovered what a legend he was," Griswold said. "He was serious about his teams learning the game of basketball. You were there for a reason, and if you came to practice to fool around you ended up running laps or hitting the showers."
 Rose said Hank stressed defense above all. "If you weren't ready to play defense, you weren't going to play for Hank," he said. "You also had to be professional both on and off the basketball court. He wanted you to be a good player on the basketball court and a good person in the community. Hank was a man of high character, and he wanted his players to be like that as well."
 Siever played for three seasons under Hank and then got to see a totally different side of his old coach when he worked under him at Plymouth-Carver.
 "Hank's idea was to pass and move the basketball and always keep it in motion. He didn't want you just hold the basketball on offense," Siever said. "You had to be disciplined and be in good shape if you wanted to play basketball for Hank Rogers. Basketball was my favorite sport to play in high school, and I loved playing for him."
 Siever's bond with Hank only strengthened over time.
 "He was stern and disciplined as a basketball coach, but over the years I got to see a different side of him. Hank was a man who loved to laugh and loved his golf at the Plymouth Country Club," Siever said. "As a coach he pushed you be the best player that you could be. He had a real presence about him when he walked into a room, and I was lucky enough to have an amazing relationship over the years. I got to see a new side of him as I grew older and we became good friends."
 Rogers died in June of 2011 after a short illness. He was 88.

She calls it #NewsNotNoise, and her goal is to avoid the sports-style political news coverage she feels is too-prevalent--who's up, who's down, and 24-hour BREAKING NEWS banners--and pare down the day's top stories via to- camera segments, timely interviews, and screen grabs from reliable news sources complete with added context in clean font and Instagram-familiar pastel boxes. She believes the information needs of her audience--mostly women in their 20s to 40s--are often left out of the larger news conversation.
 "They don't want the outrage, the negativity, the anger, and the extreme partisanship. They just want to know things: What's actually happening? Explain what you really mean. Cut the jargon. Tell me two facts that really matter, and give me a context. How did other presidents handle this? Is this better or worse?" Yellin says.
 Comedian and actress Anjelah Johnson-Reyes says that's exactly what she needs and gets from Yellin's feed. She feels like news and information are coming from everywhere, and she wants context delivered in an accessible way. "Can you just explain for me in layman's terms, what does this mean?" Johnson-Reyes says. "And that's what she provides." By not playing on people's emotions and breaking down confusing topics like impeachment in a "very peaceful, calm" way, Johnson-Reyes continues, Yellin makes the facts clear but lets people figure out on their own where they stand.
 "What she's done is unique," says Peter Hamby, host of Snapchat's "Good Luck America" and a journalist covering media and politics, and it's possible because of her news credentials established at national outlets. "It's harder to build an organic audience like this from scratch when you don't have pre- existing credibility."  
 Yellin is also meeting other criteria busy Americans demand. "What news consumers are most hungry for is not just credible information, but credible information relevant to their lives that is portable, is fast, is efficient, and is delivered according to their daily lives and habits," Hamby says.
 Though politicians like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, commentators like Molly Jong-Fast, and the popular account AGirlHasNoPresident post news and commentary on social media, they come from a distinctly partisan angle. Yellin, in contrast, abides by the tenet of traditional news reporters and remains non-partisan. She provides facts and honest context but never support for a particular candidate.
 Her followers include some of Instagram's most famous faces, like Jennifer Aniston, policy experts like Samantha Power, journalists such as The 19th News's Errin Haines, and other plugged-in types who use her as a backstop to their daily news intake. For them, Yellin aims to be curator-in-chief, pulling highlights from reputable sources and providing concise takeaways and memorable data points. It's reliable information, "but with compassion instead of the rage emoji," Yellin says. "And I pepper it with humor … and some irony and stuff that is from the [News Not Noise] community."
 The community also includes those looking to Yellin first for news, and their feedback keeps her honest in recognizing most people don't live for political polls and Congressional races. A recent post defined the phrase "lame duck" session (the time between an election and when the newly elected are sworn in) after she was flooded with questions following discussions of post-November Senate maneuvers.
