Those opportunities included "members sitting close to one another, sharing snacks, and stacking chairs at the end of the practice." The report notes that chairs were placed 6 inches to 10 inches apart, "with a center aisle dividing left and right stages." The larger group also split up at one point, with one group moving to a smaller room. Anyone with an especially strong voice may have also become a "superemitter" and exacerbated things. "The act of singing, itself, might have contributed to transmission through emission of aerosols, which is affected by loudness of vocalization," the authors write in the report. So what does this isolated incident mean for the bigger picture? "The potential for superspreader events underscores the importance of physical distancing, including avoiding gathering in large groups, to control spread of COVID-19," the report notes.

Longtime residents of Lakeland often talk of days past. When life was simpler, less hectic, more … livable. When traffic was lighter, stores were less crowded. Getting around town was much easier. People talked, families talked.
   
 The coronavirus has returned those simpler days to us. And while the circumstances are not ideal, it has given us the opportunity to pause, to reset our lives and think about what is really necessary and important.
   
 Some will speak of the horrors of being "stuck at home" while waiting for the time they can escape and return to their hectic, hurried unsustainable lifestyles. But others will see the light this crisis has shown them, and they will adapt and adjust their lives and be just as happy as before, and hopefully be better prepared for the next crisis that comes our way in the future.

Since mid-April, as the county’s coronavirus caseload began to flatten, Mase, in collaboration with Whitaker and other officials, has been trying to find the right time to restore access to parks while balancing the interests of public health.
 They found a solution for coastal residents in part through a model adopted in Santa Cruz County, where ocean beaches are closed between 11 a.m. and 5 p.m.
 Sonoma Coast parks and beaches similarly will be open from sunrise to 11 a.m. and after 5 p.m. to help discourage visitors from outside the area while still allowing locals to have access by foot or bicycle from home.
 The new park access is conditional and could be rolled back if necessary to address overcrowding or signs that visitors were not social distancing sufficiently, Whitaker and Mase said. Officials are encouraging people to stay as close to home as possible in their park forays and have asked that those outside the county not venture here for recreation.
 Some parking lots, especially in parks with multiple parking areas, are likely to remain closed for the time being to discourage crowding, Whitaker said. “High-touch” equipment or areas that encourage gathering will remain closed for the time being, including playgrounds, picnic areas, dog parks, campgrounds, pools, outdoor gyms, climbing walls, drinking fountains and barbecue areas.
 Parking areas will remain closed at smaller Russian River beaches like Del Rio Woods, Forestville River Access and Guerneville River park in town near the walking bridge.
 All park visitors are required to self-assess for symptoms or recent exposure to COVID-19 and must carry a face covering into all parks to use it if they are in areas where they are unable to maintain proper physical distance from others.
 Whitaker recommended parkgoers “just start out wearing a mask” in parking lots, entry ways and the first half–mile of trails, where one is most likely to encounter others.
 “Wearing a mask is about sending a message of safety to everyone in the park,” he said.
 The revised order also lays the groundwork for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to allow boats back onto Lake Sonoma, which closed to the public back in March, in alignment with the Sonoma County park closure.
 The Corps hopes to reopen the public boat launch at 9 a.m. Saturday morning, said Chris Schooley, area operations manager for lakes Sonoma and Mendocino.
 Schooley said the agency still needs a few days to get staff back on-site, complete some buoy work and schedule the trained mussel-sniffing dogs used regularly to prevent vessels contaminated with invasive Quagga and related zebra mussels from introducing them to the reservoir.
 As for the recreational area surrounding the reservoir, the Corps hopes to open the South Lake Trail trailhead a week later, and then evaluate progress before opening any more of the expansive open space, he said.
 “Those two steps right there are the easiest to implement and also the easiest to step back from if we have to throttle down, if things get out of hand,” Schooley said.
 The private Lake Sonoma Marina owned by Rick Herbert will be resuming operations, as well, for more than 300 vessel owners eager to get back on the water for fishing and pleasure boating, he said.
 “We’re ready. We’ve been ready,” Herbert said. “People are anxious.”

Many governors from both political parties saved a lot of lives by restricting travelers from Covid-19 hot spots. Florida placed a 14 day quarantine on travelers from New York and other hot spots. Despite having more seniors than the 49 other states, Florida’s Covid-19 death rate is less than half of Colorado’s. Like Florida, Texas used law enforcement to enforce a similar quarantine on visitors. Despite sharing a border with Covid-plagued Louisiana, Texas has a Covid-19 death rate four times lower than Colorado’s. After Hawaii’s democratic Governor placed a strict quarantine on visitors, and used law enforcement to back it up, Hawaii’s infection rate plunged. Colorado now has ten times the Covid-19 deaths of Hawaii.
 It was clear from the beginning of this war that if Polis allowed an unlimited amount of Covid-19 to flow into Colorado from America’s Wuhans, it would kill a lot of Coloradans. But while he ordered Coloradans to abandon their livelihoods and stay at home, Polis stubbornly allowed unlimited numbers of Covid-19 infected travelers to flow into Colorado from New York, Washington state, Detroit and other mass-infected areas.
 By doing so Polis unnecessarily jeopardized the life of every Coloradan, and imposed an even greater level of danger on our heroic medical personnel and other first responders. Was this recklessness because of Polis’ national political ambitions? Not wanting to alienate powerful democratic governors in those Covid-19 infested states? Whatever his motivations were, Polis didn’t just lose the war against this killer virus. He surrendered.
 Compounding that fatal recklessness was Polis’ failure to pull out the stops at the start of the war to protect Colorado’s nursing homes. Because Polis didn’t care enough about our most vulnerable, many became sitting ducks for the attackers. More than half of Colorado’s Covid-19 deaths are from nursing homes, which is far above the national average.
 Another undeniable and costly failure by Polis is the beat-down he suffered in the competition for testing materials. Every governor in America had the responsibility to do all they could to test as many of their residents as quickly as possible. Public safety depended on it. Governors were competing against each other to secure materials and get tests done as fast as possible. Polis failed miserably.
 As of May 11, 47 states have done more testing than Colorado. With a population of 5.8 million, Colorado has done only 108,790 tests. Utah, with just 3.2 million people, has completed 150,585 tests. New Mexico, with about a third of our population, has done almost as many tests as Colorado. Progressive Alabama, with only 4.9 million folks has done 22,000 more tests than Colorado. Polis is badly losing the testing race to almost every other state, blue and red alike. The pitiful testing levels in Colorado have undoubtedly increased the amount of Colorado’s infection and death, and further harmed Colorado’s economy.
 The invasion of Colorado by this viral killer turned Jared Polis into a wartime governor. He was given the virtually unlimited powers of a wartime Commander In Chief so that he could act quickly and boldly to save Colorado lives. By every critical measure, starting with how many died under his command, Polis lost the war.
