Jesus’ most comforting words about rest are, “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest” (Matthew 11:28). Jesus’ invitation is open for us even today. He invites us to step into a life led by Him where our weary and troubled souls can finally find out rest. The rest God gives is not like what we experience after sleeping or relaxing with Netflix and food after a long day’s work. The rest Jesus gives reaches the very depths of our heart and soul.

"Tiffany Glass" will be on view in the Mary and Charlie Babcock Wing Gallery through Nov. 29. Reservation links will be on the website, and all visitors will be required to sign up in advance for a timed admission ticket to control capacities.


  "We trained people to buy timed tickets during the Georgia O'Keeffe exhibition (2017)," Perkins said. "It gives visitors the confidence of knowing that we will not be jam-packed with people. It's a way to have the best of Reynolda and the beauty of Tiffany all to yourself. It's an exquisite experience not to have to navigate crowds."


  Increased sanitation efforts will be in place, including plexiglass at the front desk, and gloves and masks for visitors.


  "I think right now, people are very concerned about going out and managing their own safety," Perkins said. "Art museums are no-touch environments, and the few high-touch areas, such as handrails and doorknobs, will be cleaned regularly.


  "We're excited. We're ready. We're doing some additional training for our front-line people."


  Despite the inconveniences and deprivations caused by the temporary closure, Perkins said that the Reynolda House staff has responded creatively.


  "By migrating programs to online platforms, new people have able to discover our exhibitions," she said. "I think museums nationwide are experiencing this. We need to think about our virtual visitors. I think we'll have them for a long time.


  "I've thought about this COVID time as an accelerator for entrepreneurial thinking in museums. In six months, we've developed a range of new products and new content for our Reynolda Revealed app."


  At first, they were all kind of stunned by the sudden closing. "Then we said, we've got to energize. Let's get going," Perkins said.


  ## Theater and beyond


  Jamie Lawson, artistic director of Winston-Salem Theatre Alliance, had a similar reaction to Perkins'. After three months of inactivity following the initial shutdown in March, Theatre Alliance opened its first outdoor production June 3 with "Disenchanted!"


  Until this week, they have been allowed to sell only about 18 tickets per show to keep the gathering down to 25. With Phase 2.5, their capacity has increased to 50, so they will be allowed to sell more tickets to their next musical, "The Doyle and Debbie Show," which opens Friday.


  N.C. Black Rep issued a statement last week saying that it expects to hold the next National Black Theatre Festival in Winston-Salem on schedule — Aug. 2-7 — and that hotels are accepting reservations. Theatrical offerings will include "Maya Angelou: Phenomenal Woman," a world premiere by Nambi E. Kelley, commissioned by N.C. Black Rep.


  Officials at Old Salem Museums and Gardens said they will soon launch new on- site programs, such as Salem Pathways, and on-site research appointments, but buildings will remain closed to traditional in-person visitation. They will continue online programming to support teachers, students, families, and lifelong learners.


  Later in the fall, they will start offering virtual field trips, and they will continue to support the community in nontraditional ways. Since mid- March, they have donated more than 5,500 loaves of fresh bread and more than 2,500 pounds of produce from their gardens to area food banks.

Shinzo Abe’s maternal grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi was overwhelmed with emotion when as a post-War Japanese PM of a then-defeated nation, that had nonetheless been an ally of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose’s Indian National Army, came before admiring crowds in India. Shinzo Abe, when out of office in 2011 was welcomed with open arms as he addressed a gathering of the Indian Council for World Affairs filled with JNU and other faculty. Abe has never forgotten that special feature of India (that he also heard about earlier as a child on his grandfather’s lap). Indeed, BJP National Executive Member and Rajya Sabha MP, Dr Subramanian Swamy pinpointed that unique aspect which makes India attractive, by pointing out on a video call to thousands of young scholars and scientists contemplating a return to India to contribute to making India a great power someday, that India permits multiple personal and professional failures cheerfully along the way, unlike harsh situations in some industrial countries where “gyanis” (knowledgeable persons) and “tyagis” (those who live not merely for the pursuit of wealth) are not necessarily always welcomed nor respected.

It is now mostly in Islamist religious politics that one still finds intense ideological anxieties about the Palestinian question. It’s no accident Hamas now finds its main patrons in Ankara and Teheran. To the present-day leaders of Turkey and Iran, the Palestinian condition symbolises something important about the standing and trajectory of the Muslim world. Their support is thus assured for the time being, though only for the part of Palestinian politics raising the Islamist banner.

In 2004, Pranab Mukherjee should have, purely on merit and seniority, become Prime Minister. Instead, the Congress president appointed Manmohan Singh. One would have expected Pranabji to resign. Manmohan Singh had been his subordinate for a number of years. The remarkable manner in which the two adjusted to this most unusual situation does immense credit to both. Manmohan is by temperament a non-ego individual. Pranabji was a non-pretentious person. He conducted himself with supreme maturity and not once did he rock the boat between 2004 and 2014. Collisions were avoided. He never attempted to upstage the Prime Minister. The two had a commitment to truthfulness and decency. Manmohan Singh always treated his former boss with respect, even reverence.

TOKYO: The first time Shinzo Abe retired as Prime Minister was in 2007, when he had an exacerbation of the ulcerative colitis (UC) that has been with him since his teenage years. This time too, the officially stated reason is the same, that he has to take care of his health and now change the treatment he was on earlier to a monoclonal antibody, Adalimumab or Infliximab. That is certainly all true, but then as well as now, there have been other factors that may have been important as well. Given that UC is certainly not a terminal illness, but a debilitating one nonetheless, yet given the longevity of the Japanese—over 70,000 people are living aged 100 and above—one may see Abe once more in the saddle after another pause. The reason is that Shinzo Abe and Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike are the two most dominant figures on the Japanese political scene and they both tower above everyone else. Governor Koike is not currently part of any major political party. PM Abe is strongly supported by the omnipresent Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), that even changed its own party constitution to permit Mr Abe extra three-year terms. That is how Shinzo Abe, now only aged 65, already became the longest-serving Japanese Prime Minister. Abe will remain an MP from Yamaguchi Prefecture where he is beloved and undefeated in nine parliamentary elections.

The Palestinian national movement is now at a crossroads. To be sure, the Arab world still cares about the Palestinians, sometimes deeply. But the Palestinian story has nevertheless shrunk from representing a broader Arab story to a tragedy that affects only the Palestinians, and in the process lost its grip on Arab policymaking. The oil-rich Gulf states are now respected global business hubs that view the West not as an oppressor or competing civilisation, but as a target for investment and a source of stability. The new threats that loom over the Arab world are regional – Iran, Turkey, Islamist factions of various sorts – or deeply local, from corruption to sectoral strife. The Arab world has changed, the Palestinian narrative has not.

My previous article in this column, Could a judicial decision violate your Fundamental Rights?, examined the first proposition - that is, whether a judicial order passed by any superior court in judicial proceedings can be said to violate a fundamental right - and concluded that it certainly could, particularly in light of the authoritative pronouncements made by the Supreme Court itself. This article first considers the latter proposition laid down in Rupa Ashok Hurra, namely, that the judiciary is not ‘State’ under Article 12, and then discusses the remedy of a ‘curative petition’ conceived by the Court in this case – a remedy that is hardly likely to come to the rescue of a litigant who complains that a judicial decision of the Supreme Court has offended his fundamental rights.
