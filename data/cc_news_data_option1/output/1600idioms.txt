WASHINGTON -- More than 4.4 million laid-off workers applied for U.S. unemployment benefits last week as job cuts escalated across an economy that remains all but shut down, the government said Thursday.
 Roughly 26 million people have now filed for jobless aid in the five weeks since the coronavirus outbreak began forcing millions of employers to close their doors. About one in six American workers have lost their jobs in the past five weeks, by far the worst string of layoffs on record. That's more than the number of people who live in the 10 largest U.S. cities combined.
 Economists have forecast that the unemployment rate for April could go as high as 20%.
 The enormous magnitude of job cuts has plunged the U.S. economy into the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Some economists say the nation's output could shrink by twice the amount that it did during the Great Recession, which ended in 2009.
 An urgent question for the unemployed is how quickly the economy may rebound. Most economists expect some employers to start rehiring within months, though significant job gains aren't considered likely until later in the year.
 Few experts foresee a downturn anywhere near as long as the Great Depression. During the Depression, unemployment stayed high for nearly a decade, with the jobless rate remaining above 14% from 1931 all the way to 1940. But unemployment is considered likely to remain elevated well into next year and probably beyond.
 The painful economic consequences of the virus-related shutdowns have sparked protests in several state capitals from crowds insisting that businesses be allowed to reopen. Thursday's report, showing that the pace of layoffs remains immense, could heighten demands for re-openings.
 Some governors have begun easing restrictions despite warnings from health authorities that it may be too soon to do so without causing new infections. In Georgia, gyms, hair salons and bowling alleys can reopen Friday. Texas has reopened its state parks.
 Yet those scattered re-openings won't lead to much rehiring, especially if Americans are too wary to leave their homes. Most people say they favor stay- at-home orders, according to a survey by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs and believe it won't be safe to lift social distancing guidelines anytime soon. And there are likely more layoffs to come from many small businesses that have tried but failed to receive loans from a federal aid program.
 The number of people who are receiving unemployment benefits has reached a record 16 million, surpassing a previous high of 12 million set in 2010, just after the 2008-2009 recession ended. This figure reflects people who have managed to navigate the application systems in their states, have been approved for benefits and are actually receiving checks.
 Women make up a majority of workers in some industries that have been hit hardest, such as health care, where many jobs outside hospitals have been lost, and hotels and restaurants. Heidi Shierholz, an economist at the progressive Economic Policy Institute, calculates that 56% of the layoffs have involved women.
 "As in all recessions, job loss in this recession is not being meted out equally," Shierholz said.
 African-Americans and Latinos are typically among the first to be laid off in recessions. Though the government doesn't track the jobless claims data by gender or race, a survey by the University of Southern California found that 21% of African Americans and 18% of Latinos say they have lost jobs in the past month, compared with 15% of whites.
 One factor in that disparity is the ability to work from home. A study by the Center for American Progress found that whites are more than twice as likely as blacks to say they can work from home and 50% more likely than Latinos.
 Just about every major industry has absorbed sudden and severe layoffs. Economists at the Federal Reserve estimate that hotels and restaurants have shed the most jobs -- 4 million since Feb. 15. That is nearly one-third of all the employees in that industry.
 Construction has shed more than 9% of its jobs. So has a category that includes retail, shipping and utilities, the Fed estimated.
 Europe's economies, too, are headed for severe recessions, with surveys of economic activity released Thursday hitting all-time lows. The downturn is putting at risk up to 59 million jobs -- 26% of employment in the European Union -- according to McKinsey, the consulting firm. That figure includes people who could be laid off outright as well as those who are still on payrolls but might be put on shorter work hours or furloughs.
 Unemployment is also likely to rise in the United Kingdom. Analysts at Capital Economics say the U.K. economy is headed for its biggest quarterly economic contraction in more than a century.
 In Florida, applications for unemployment benefits nearly tripled last week to 505,000, the second-highest total behind much-larger California's 534,000. Florida has had trouble processing many of its applications. Its figure suggests that the state is finally clearing a backlog of filings from jobless workers.
 In Michigan, 17% of the state's workforce is now receiving unemployment aid, the largest proportion in the country. It is followed by Rhode Island at 15%, Nevada at 13.7% and Georgia at 13.6%.
 "This has been a really devastating shock for a lot of families and small businesses," said Aaron Sojourner, a labor economist at the University of Minnesota.
 A federal relief package enacted last month made millions of gig workers, contractors and self-employed people newly eligible for unemployment aid. But most states have yet to approve unemployment applications from those workers because they're still trying to reprogram their systems to do so. As a result, many people who have lost jobs or income aren't being counted as laid-off because their applications for unemployment aid haven't been processed.
 Among them is Sasha McVeigh, a musician in Nashville. Having grown up in England with a love of country music, she spent years flying to Nashville to play gigs until she managed to secure a green card and move permanently two years ago. McVeigh had been working steadily until the city shut down music clubs in mid-March.
 Since then, she's applied for unemployment benefits but so far has received nothing. To make ends meet, she's applied for some grants available to out-of- work musicians, held some live streaming concerts and pushed her merchandise sales.
 By cutting expenses to a bare minimum, McVeigh said, "I've managed to just about keep myself afloat." But she worries about what will happen over the next few months.

WASHINGTON — A nearly $500 billion measure helping businesses and hospitals ride out the coronavirus' devastation edged toward House passage Thursday, as lawmakers' face masks and bandannas added an eerie tone to Congress' effort to aid a staggered nation.
 "Millions of people out of work," said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. "This is really a very, very, very sad day. We come to the floor with nearly 50,000 deaths, a huge number of people impacted, and the uncertainty of it all."
 The day's debate was almost overshadowed by social distancing steps that produced a stark image of how the pandemic is changing what used to be normal behavior in Washington.
 As Pelosi spoke, she lowered a white scarf that had covered much of her face. House Chaplain Patrick Conroy delivered the opening prayer wearing a yellow protective mask, and most lawmakers and aides on the chamber's sparsely populated floor wore masks as well.
 With the entire Capitol closed to the public, visitors' galleries were set aside for lawmakers in an effort to separate them.
 The package was headed toward certain, overwhelming approval later Thursday, an action that would send the measure to President Donald Trump for his signature. The Senate approved the legislation Tuesday.
 But partisan divides remained over the government's response to the country's unprecedented health and economic crises — some of them literally visible.
 Of the roughly two dozen lawmakers on the chamber's floor as debate began, just two were not wearing masks — Republican Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio and James Comer of Kentucky.
 In addition, Republicans chided Democrats for holding up the initial version of the bill by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., which included just $250 billion, all of it for small businesses.
 After two weeks, GOP leaders agreed to expand the bill as Democrats insisted on more money for small businesses in minority and rural communities, hospitals and for virus testing. During that period, the government exhausted an initial $250 billion lawmakers had provided in earlier emergency legislation.
 Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, blamed Pelosi for delaying the money as "small businesses and their workers desperately fought to hold on." He added, "How many jobs could we have saved if partisan politics had not reared its ugly head."
 Pelosi blamed Republicans and McConnell for the holdup, saying Democrats had changed a GOP-written "corporate-oriented trickle-down bill to a worker-first, bubble-up bill."
 She also singled out McConnell for at first opposing adding any money to his original $250 billion package and saying cash-strapped states should be allowed to declare bankruptcy, a move they currently cannot do and that would threaten a broad range of state services.

SPRINGFIELD -- Gov. JB Pritzker said Tuesday the state's COVID-19 peak could come in mid-May and he is examining the current stay-at-home order for potential changes.
   
 The governor made the comments during a Washington Post Live interview with reporter Robert Costa.
   
 Pritzker said people "have really been abiding by" the state's second-in-the- nation stay-at-home order, which he said led to fewer deaths and hospitalizations than anticipated at this point.
   
 "And so the result of that has been the pushing out of what had been anticipated to be a peaking in the middle or near the end of April, so it's been pushed out now according to the models to maybe mid-May but at a lower level," he said.
   
 Pritzker was asked about differences in the Chicagoland area and downstate Illinois when it comes to fighting the virus, and he said there are different infection rates depending on region. That could inform changes to the stay-at- home order, the governor said, although he did not directly respond to a follow-up as to whether some counties might reopen before others.
   
 "And now I think we can make some adjustments based upon hospitalization rates, based upon ICU bed availability, based upon infection rates, as we look to, how can we begin to adjust things and work toward -- after the peak -- really reopening the economy," Pritzker said.
   
 He was also asked about recent tweets from President Donald Trump calling to "liberate" certain states with Democratic governors.
   
 "When he tweets out liberate Michigan or liberate Minnesota, or liberate Virginia, he's fomenting protest and I hate to say that is fomenting some violence and I'm very concerned about what that might mean for the country if he keeps doing things like that," Pritzker said.
   
 The governor said the president "should be pulling people together right now," and he noted recent protests of stay-at-home orders nationwide will likely lead to a wider spread of the virus, including more deaths among those who attended the events.
   
 "They're frankly going to be giving each other coronavirus and people unfortunately will get sick, and some people may die as a result of the president's rhetoric that has brought them out to protest," he said.
   
 While Pritzker praised the federal government's efforts to help set up an alternate care facility at the McCormick Place convention center in downtown Chicago, he said they fell short in other areas. He once again said Trump could have used the Defense Production Act to force greater manufacturing of testing supplies and personal protective equipment. He said Illinois received "maybe 10 percent" of what the state needed from the federal government in terms of PPE.
   
 "None of that has been done at the federal government level," he said. "That's the mistake that has been made all along here, we could have organized this and led this on a federal level."
   
 Harmon Letter
   
 The state's five Republican congressmen responded Monday to a letter sent last week by Illinois Senate President Don Harmon requesting $40 billion in aid to the state, including $10 billion for the state's pension system, which has an unfunded liability of $138 billion.
   
 The GOP members hold five of Illinois' 18 Congressional seats, and they said Harmon, D-Oak Park, should consider pushing structural reforms before requesting "aid that is beyond this immediate crisis."
   
 "We will fight for more aid to support the state and local governments in Illinois, but your letter assumes the federal government will approve aid that is beyond this immediate crisis," the congressmen wrote. "For example, you suggest the state's revenue loss will be approximately $14.1 billion, but your letter requests aid that is many multiples of the state's loss projections. We fully support federal assistance to help defray some of the state's losses, but we oppose using the crisis as an opportunity for a full-scale federal bailout."
   
 They said the pandemic did not cause the pension crisis in Illinois, but only "further illuminated the one that already existed."
   
 While the GOP members said they will "work with" the state to provide more resources, they said Illinois must reform its pension system, reduce spending and local government mandates, and "withdraw the graduated income tax increase to protect Illinois jobs that are already at risk from the pandemic and to stem the exodus of people and opportunity from our great state."

 Sharing a border with another state with medical marijuana has affected sales in Arkansas.
 Arkansas and Oklahoma have both legalized use of medical cannabis in recent years, but between the two states, the laws are slightly different. Oklahoma has over 200,000 medical marijuana patients while Arkansas sits lower with only a little over 40,000 as of this week.
 To become a medical marijuana cardholder, patients must have a certain disability or illness that the Arkansas Department of Health has deemed suitable. In Oklahoma there are no requirements someone must meet. All they need is a referral from a physician.
 The prices in Arkansas, however, are much higher than that of Oklahoma because there are fewer cultivation facilities. If someone were to purchase a gram of medical cannabis in Arkansas they would be paying double the amount than they would if they were in Oklahoma. A gram in Oklahoma costs about $10 depending on the quality, but a gram of that same quality would be $20 in Arkansas.
 Storm Nolan, a local hotel executive and medical marijuana advocate, said that getting a temporary license for Oklahoma could be a better option. A temporary license allows an individual with a medical license from another state to legally buy, use, and grow medical marijuana in Oklahoma. A license will cost the patient $100 and be valid for 30 days. A temporary card for Arkansas is only $50, but the price for cannabis is higher.
 Wesley Bunn, a former dispensary worker in Oklahoma, said that temporary license holders from Arkansas came in frequently. He added that they typically complained about the prices, strictness of the laws, and even the unwelcome environment that they felt when purchasing the product in their home state.
 Nolan attributed the prices to the small amount of cultivation facilities and dispensaries in the state. Currently there are only five cultivation facilities and 16 dispensaries. There are now a total of 33 dispensary licenses.
 According to the Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration the five cultivation licenses were awarded in July 2018 to Natural State Medicinals Cultivation, Bold Team LLC, Natural State Wellness Enterprises, Osage Creek Cultivation, and Delta Medical Cannabis Company Inc. However, only three are releasing product currently. The other two are expected to release medical cannabis products soon. There is a three to four month growing cycle.
 In Poteau, Okla., alone there are 27 licensed growers. He said that with more dispensaries and growers the price will go down and the number of patients will rise. The negative aspect of harder-to-obtain medical marijuana causes some to seek cannabis through other means like black market sales. This leaves patients without a safer and regulated option.
 Since opening their first dispensary, medical marijuana sales have surpassed over $40 million in Arkansas. This happened in the first 10 months. In Oklahoma, sales reached over $258 million in the same time span. Oklahoma has surpassed Arkansas in business and because of this, patients are more likely to take their business one state over for better prices on product. Only time will tell how far Arkansas is willing to go when it comes to growing their medical marijuana business. This will either include amendments to the laws making it easier for patients to obtain cards, adding more facilities, or both.
 As noted in a January 2019 Times Record report, three of the four medical marijuana dispensaries chosen for west central Arkansas' Zone 4 this week are in Fort Smith, and one is in Yell County.
 Many of the dispensaries in the Arkansas are also allowed to grow 50 cannabis plants onsite.
 The top four ranking Zone 4 dispensary applications approved by the Arkansas Marijuana Commission went to Valentine Holdings, doing business as River Valley Medical Cannabis Company, 9401 Rogers Ave., in Fort Smith; Natural State Wellness Dispensary, at Newlon Road and North Sixth Street, in Fort Smith;; JPS Management, doing business as Fort Cannabis Co., 3904 Ayers Road, in Fort Smith; and River Valley Dispensary, 23788 West Highway 28, in Yell County's Bluffton with 342.39 points.

 In Poteau, Okla., alone there are 27 licensed growers. He said that with more dispensaries and growers the price will go down and the number of patients will rise. The negative aspect of harder-to-obtain medical marijuana causes some to seek cannabis through other means like black market sales. This leaves patients without a safer and regulated option.
   
 Since opening their first dispensary, medical marijuana sales have surpassed over $40 million in Arkansas. This happened in the first 10 months. In Oklahoma, sales reached over $258 million in the same time span. Oklahoma has surpassed Arkansas in business and because of this, patients are more likely to take their business one state over for better prices on product. Only time will tell how far Arkansas is willing to go when it comes to growing their medical marijuana business. This will either include amendments to the laws making it easier for patients to obtain cards, adding more facilities, or both.
   
 As noted in a January 2019 Times Record report, three of the four medical marijuana dispensaries chosen for west central Arkansas' Zone 4 this week are in Fort Smith, and one is in Yell County.
   
 Many of the dispensaries in the Arkansas are also allowed to grow 50 cannabis plants onsite.
   
 The top four ranking Zone 4 dispensary applications approved by the Arkansas Marijuana Commission went to Valentine Holdings, doing business as River Valley Medical Cannabis Company, 9401 Rogers Ave., in Fort Smith; Natural State Wellness Dispensary, at Newlon Road and North Sixth Street, in Fort Smith;; JPS Management, doing business as Fort Cannabis Co., 3904 Ayers Road, in Fort Smith; and River Valley Dispensary, 23788 West Highway 28, in Yell County's Bluffton with 342.39 points.

In the heart of the 1970s, amidst a flurry of feathered hair and flared jeans, Gru (Steve Carell) is growing up in the suburbs. A fanboy of a supervillain supergroup known as the Vicious 6, Gru hatches a plan to become evil enough to join them. Luckily, he gets some mayhem-making back-up from his loyal followers, the Minions. Together, Kevin, Stuart, Bob, and Otto - a new Minion sporting braces and a desperate need to please - deploy their skills as they and Gru build their first lair, experiment with their first weapons, and pull off their first missions. When the Vicious 6 oust their leader, legendary fighter Wild Knuckles (Alan Arkin), Gru interviews to become their newest member. It doesn't go well (to say the least), and only gets worse after Gru outsmarts them and suddenly finds himself the mortal enemy of the apex of evil. On the run, Gru will turn to an unlikely source for guidance, Wild Knuckles, and discover that even bad guys need a little help from their friends."

 “At the Battle of Waterloo, Samuel was commanded by Lt Col Shapland Boyse and formed part of the 7th Cavalry Brigade.
 “During the battle Samuel and his comrades made repeated devastating charges against the French.”
 They joined the Army of Occupation in France before returning to England in 1816.
 In 1819 Samuel sailed with the Regiment for India and after a four-month voyage, landed in Madras and from there marched to Mysore, where they stayed for six years before travelling to postings in Northern India.

Shot at Brooklyn’s Kings Theater, the film has surviving members Mike Diamond, aka “Mike D,” and Adam Horovitz, aka “Ad-Rock,” on stage talking to a lively audience about their coming together, their rise, their fall, a second rise and, ultimately, the tragic death of their third member, Adam Yauch, aka “MCA,” painted by the surviving members as the creative genius of the trio.
 Deftly captured by Jonze ("Her," "Adaptation") — who helmed the memorable video for the Boys’ raging 1994 anthem “Sabotage” — “Beastie Boys” feels as close to an actual night out at an event as anything I’ve experienced during this time of sheltering in place. Seriously, make a Friday night IN out of it. (Brass Monkeys are an optional cocktail choice.)
 After an introduction consisting of clips of the gents from back in the day, as well as fans talking about how much they love them, we hear the crazy baseline from “Sabotage” — followed by beginning screaming lyrics of “I can’t stand it, I know you planned it!/Imma set it straight, this Watergate!” Then, finally, Horovitz and Diamond take the stage. (The event that serves as the backbone of the documentary is an offshoot of similar events the guys held to promote their 571-page 2018 New York Times bestseller, “Beastie Boys Book.”)
 In what proves to be a very entertaining walk-through of their career, they start at the beginning — talking of early versions of the band, of initial members who came and went and of recordings that, much to their surprise, started to be played in certain spots around the city.
 They speak of how influential pioneering hip-hop group Run-DMC was to them, as well as how they hooked up with producer Rick Rubin — their “weird, cool older brother” — and manager Russell Simmons.
 Soon enough, they get to touring with Madonna and the release of the album that truly would change their lives, 1986’s “License to Ill.” On that album, of course, resided “Fight for Your Right,” a party anthem they made to make fun of, as they say, “party bros and frat guys” — only to discover those guys LOVED IT. And, Horovitz and Diamond say, they liked being loved, so they were fine with this turn of events.
 As “License to Ill” blew up, they say, Simmons pushed them to keep touring and touring and touring. Not surprisingly, the trio became burned out and took some time apart.
 Eventually together in Los Angeles and with their creative juices finally flowing again, they released 1989’s “Paul’s Boutique,” an album of which they were very proud.
 “Crickets,” they say of the response. To hear them tell it, the world could not have cared less.

 Kristi Gee, chamber director, said the idea was floated by Belgrade High School Athletic Director Rick Phillips, who suggested the event would be a good way to bring the community together while safely showing “Panther spirit.” Other communities around the country have held similar events during the COVID-19 quarantine.
 Residents are invited to decorate their cars and join the cruise from 7-8:30 p.m. All are asked to respect all traffic laws and stay in their vehicles to conform with social distancing guidelines, but are encouraged to “honk and wave at your neighbors and get out and see people you haven’t seen for a while.”
 Gee said the chamber has asked willing businesses to participate, perhaps by offering discounts on shakes or ice cream. The chamber will blast fun music from its office at Broadway and Main.

Because we acted early with input from public health and emergency response experts, Montana has a significantly lower rate of infection per capita than many of states that did not act as aggressively.
 Yesterday, President Trump convened a call with the nation’s governors and laid out guidelines on reopening the economy. On that call, the President told us that we governors will call the shots in our own states.
 First, I want to say thank you, Mr. President, for recognizing that every state is different. Here in Montana, we’ve been able to keep our relatively cases low, because we know what is best for our state and because we care about our neighbors.
 Over this past month, Montanans have demonstrated their individual independence and strong sense of community once again. Montanans have protected their family and friends by communicating virtually. They have stayed home while finding ways to support local restaurants and other businesses providing take out or delivery services. Many business owners and entrepreneurs have shifted their efforts to producing 3D masks or producing hand sanitizer to help fight this virus.
 These efforts have not been for nothing. Together, we are not only saving lives, but also making it so that we will be able to reopen our state and get our economy thriving again, long before many other states will be able to.
 I know Montanans are hurting financially. We all want to get Montanans
 working again.
 So we are taking steps to get there. For over a week, I have been working with public health experts and business leaders to determine how we can open our state up, while keeping people safe and avoiding a new outbreak or becoming the next hotspot in our region.
 This week, I announced the creation of the Coronavirus Relief Fund Task Force to help sustain Montanans through the pandemic and to put the state on a path to economic recovery.
 Montana will receive $1.25 billion dollars to respond to this crisis and support Montanans who need it most — small businesses, workers, tribal communities, non-profits, and state and local governments.
 Over the next couple of weeks, the Task Force will examine sectors of the economy to understand the impacts of COVID-19 on Montanans, consider the unique needs of each region of the state, and provide guidance on how to best utilize these funds to address the immediate needs of Montanans and with an eye towards an immediate and long-term path to economic recovery.
 More than just how to spend money from the federal government, we have been working on how Montanans can be earning and spending their own money. Montana’s Adjutant General Quinn is leading a process based on military strategic planning principles to look at when and how Montana can safely take steps to reopen. The process includes the expertise of public health, emergency response, local providers, and business and industry leaders.
 But let me be clear: Montana’s stay at home directive is in effect through April 24 and will stay in effect through April 24. After April 24, we will move forward with a phased reopening.
 We all need to understand this will be a gradual process. Because once we begin to reopen, we want to be able to stay open.
 Our new normal is going to look different. This virus isn’t going away and we are going to have to continue to adapt with how we live with it for the next while.

 Gee said if the event is successful, it may be repeated on Friday, May 1.

A letter written by Mahatma Gandhi in 1932 regarding raising of funds for the newly-founded Harijan Sewak Sangh is set to go under the hammer, officials said on Thursday. The letter will be auctioned online by Boston-based RR Auction and is expected to fetch USD 15,000, the auction house said in a statement.
 The one-page handwritten letter is signed "M. K. Gandhi," and dated October 9, 1932. "Dear friends, I thank you for your letter of sympathy. The funds can be sent to the anti untouchability assn formed under the chairmanship by Sjt. G. D. Birla for the furtherance of its subjects," read the letter. It is beautifully mounted, double-matted, and framed.
 In 1932, Gandhi founded the Harijan Sevak Sangh as part of his efforts to eradicate the concept of 'untouchability' from India's caste system. He put his close friend, the pioneering industrialist Ghanshyam Das Birla, in charge of the organisation. The group's noble efforts have helped the depressed classes to access public places such as temples, schools, roads, and water resources that were previously available only to those of privilege, it said.
 "It's a superb letter pertaining to one of the overlooked aspects of Gandhi's activism," said an auction official. Additional highlights from the sale include, Gandhi's signature with a fountain pen, "M. K. Gandhi," on an off- white slip of paper, it added.
 The Fine Autographs and Artifacts auction from RR Auction with online bidding is scheduled to conclude on May 13..

WASHINGTON (AP) — The House is voting Thursday to create a new subcommittee that will track more than $2 trillion in coronavirus aid, adding another layer of oversight as President Donald Trump's administration carries out the largest economic rescue in U.S. history.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says the new House Oversight and Reform subcommittee is necessary to root out fraud and abuse and to examine the government’s overall response. It will supplement the work of other watchdogs tasked with tracking the dollars, including a committee of inspectors general, a congressional panel of experts and a special Treasury Department official.The new 12-member panel, with a 7-5 Democratic majority, will also have the power to subpoena Trump administration officials and conduct depositions.Republicans spoke out against it ahead of the vote, saying it duplicates the work of other committees and will be politicized by Democrats.Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole, the top Republican on the House Rules Committee, said the panel will “simply turn into yet another partisan witch hunt aimed at damaging the president.” Rep. Jody Hice, R-Ga., said Democrats are creating the panel “because they hate the president of the United States.” And Rep. Drew Ferguson, R-Ga., compared it to previous investigations into Russian election interference and last year’s impeachment proceedings and said Democrats were “like a bird dog pointing to a quail. You can't help yourselves.''House Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern, D-Mass., said the committee needs to be formed because the president is already undercutting oversight of the economic rescue law. Trump has said his administration will not comply with some of independent oversight requests, and he ousted the official who had been appointed to lead the committee of inspectors general, called the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee.“When it comes to $2 trillion, I don’t think there can be enough oversight,” McGovern said. “I think our constituents expect us to make sure that that money is being spent, where it should be spent, where Congress intended it.”Pelosi said she modeled the panel on a committee led by then-Sen. Harry Truman to look at defense spending during World War II. She has already appointed South Carolina Rep. James Clyburn, the No. 3 House Democrat, as its chairman.The committee’s oversight will go beyond just tracking the dollars. The members will be tasked with reviewing the government’s preparedness, including implementation of testing and stockpiling of protective equipment; the effects of the coronavirus on minority populations and whether any government whistleblowers are protected. It is also being asked to review executive branch “policies, deliberations, decisions, activities, and internal and external communications" related to the coronavirus pandemic.Pelosi said the committee will ensure “the federal response is based on the best possible science and guided by health experts, and that the money invested is not being exploited by profiteers and price gougers."Creation of the subcommittee came amid criticism of a Democratic appointee to a separate oversight panel. Rep. Donna Shalala of Florida, Pelosi's choice for a new Congressional Oversight Commission, failed to disclose stock sales she made in 2019 following her 2018 election to Congress. Shalala told the Miami Herald she sold the stocks to eliminate potential conflicts of interest, but by failing to disclose the sales, she may have violated a law meant to combat insider trading by members of Congress.“I absolutely missed those deadlines, and I apologize for them,'' Shalala said Wednesday. ”It was my mistake, and I take full responsibility.”Shalala, a former health and human services secretary in the Clinton administration, is serving her first term in Congress.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

FRAMINGHAM - Kevin Brock typically made upwards of 30 trips during a normal eight-to-10-hour shift driving for Tommy's Taxi.
 That number has been slashed significantly in the weeks since the coronavirus outbreak began ravaging the region, state, nation and world. Brock estimates his largest workload since the outbreak began was 15 trips.
 "Nobody is traveling," said Brock, who has worked on and off at Tommy's Taxi for the past 25 years. "Business is way off."
 Like many other industries, the taxi and limousine businesses have felt the pain from the pandemic.
 Jo-Anne Thompson, owner and president of Tommy's Taxi, said business is down by about 75%. The company laid off several drivers, but Thompson hopes to bring them back once the crisis eases. The Framingham company has only 11 of its taxis in operation due to the lack of business.
 Customers without their own transportation have been hailing taxis to take them to the grocery store, pharmacy, liquor store, doctor's appointments and to work. But airport runs, trips to commuter rail stations and other locations have dropped steadily. Brock typically traveled to Logan Airport a handful of times a week, but said he may go there only once a week since the outbreak.
 "Our work has dropped way off because there's no place to go," said Thompson.
 We are allowing free access to all coronavirus-related stories that benefit public health and will continue to do so throughout this crisis. We are doing so as a public service. We encourage you to support our locally-focused journalism by subscribing to MetroWestDailyNews.com or to MilfordDailyNews.com
 Tommy's Taxi, which has been in business since 1946, is taking several precautionary measures to ensure both drivers and passengers are safe. Each vehicle is sanitized in the morning and at night. Vehicles are also sanitized after each run, including cleaning the seats, door handles, arm rests and credit card machines. Drivers wear masks and gloves. Thompson has made homemade wipes for drivers to disinfect the vehicles.
 "We're cleaning everything all the time," she said.
 Lexan plastic partitions have been installed in all vehicles to create a barrier between the drivers and passengers.
 "Drivers generally don't like partitions because it creates a barrier between (them and) their customers," said Thompson.
 But Brock said the partitions serve as an extra layer of safety.
 "You don't worry too much if the customer has a mask on," he said.
 Business has been similarly slow at Milford's Accent Limousine Service. Owner Rick Nashawaty said the family-owned company typically does between 40 and 70 runs a day, a number that has dropped to three to five a week. Many of those trips have been picking up snow birds returning from the South at the airport, taking others to doctor appointments and out-of-state runs.
 Of his 25-vehicle fleet, only seven are on the road.
 "It's a huge difference," he said.
 Spring is typically busy for Nashawaty with proms, weddings, concerts and trips to Red Sox, Bruins and Celtics games.
 "There's not many places we can take people," he said.
 Like Tommy's Taxi, Nashawaty and his staff are taking similar precautions against infection, such as sterilizing vehicles after each run to keep riders safe.
 Both Nashawaty and Thompson are hopeful the outbreak will recede soon and they can safely get their business back.
 "No COVID-19 is going to take us down," said Thompson.

FRANKLIN - The decision on whether or not to order face coverings in public in town was met with mixed feelings at a Town Council roundtable discussion on Wednesday.
 "I would be hesitant to mandate (a town-wide mask requirement) without all the information, and I would really want it to be based in science and fact, not perception," Franklin Board of Health Chair Bridget Sweet said during the meeting. She said some measures being mandated, like Plexiglas shields at supermarkets and banning the use of reusable bags, is largely based on perception rather than evidence to support their effectiveness in reducing the spread of COVID-19.
 "It's almost more so mob mentality - if you're not wearing a mask and you're in a public place, people are sort of giving you the hairy eye," said Sweet, citing a mask mandate order recently issued by the town of Everett, which asks anyone over the age of 5 years old to wear a facial covering.
 "It seems a little too restrictive in my opinion," she said, but added that the Board of Health is open to drafting a mandate if the Town Council asked them.
 "I'm a little cautious of that blanket statement because I think when people see that masks are required, they stop the social distancing piece, and the social distancing piece is so important," she said.
 Councilor Melanie Hamblen owns Franklin Agway, a pet, garden and farm store that is considered an essential business during the pandemic. Employees at her store are required to wear masks and ask customers not to use cash to avoid possibly transmitting the virus. On Wednesday, she taped a sign to their storefront asking customers to also wear a mask when entering the store.
 "But you can't send people away when you're trying to stay in business," she said. "If there was a mandate for wearing a mask in essential businesses, then that would help us a lot because then it's not us (just enforcing it). People come into the store - they're mad at us. We get yelled at and sweared at all the time, and it is not a pretty picture."
 By enforcing masks to be worn in public, "maybe then they'll take it seriously," she said.
 Sweet said that the board could consider issuing an order directing customers to do so, and added that many supermarkets have also put up signs encouraging face coverings and staying home when sick.
 "I think that the supermarkets really should mandate for people to enter the stores with a mask - no mask, no entrance, would be a perfect statement to make," said Councilor Deborah Pellegri, who added that she would agree to mandating masks in town.
 "The issue becomes enforcement," said Town Attorney Mark Cerel. "My take would be that if you posted clear signage as a property owner, that this is a condition of entering the premises and if you disregarded it you would be treated as a trespasser, then that might give the stores some enforcement rights."
 However, some councilors, including the town's health director, said the mask mandate may lead residents to scale back on the importance of social distancing.
 "What I am afraid of is that if this is a mandate, it does give a sense of false security and may stop people from social distancing," said Health Director Cathy Liberty.
 "I agree with the Board of Health agent - it gives a false sense of security, I'd rather have everyone washing their hands more," said Councilor Matt Kelly, Vice Chairman Robert Dellorco seconding his statement.
 Councilor Eamon McCarthy Earls agreed, and said the order wouldn't apply to all situations, like going for a walk alone in a state forest.
 But if a mask mandate were to be issued by the board, Sweet stressed that it isn't limited to N95 masks.
 "We don't want those surgical masks going to this population - it can be a bandana, it can be a scarf, it can be pulling up your turtleneck," said Sweet. It just needs to cover your nose and mouth.
 Sweet said there are six criteria regarding opening the state back up and letting non-essential businesses reopen, which includes a documented downward trajectory of positive COVID-19 cases within a two-week period and hospitals being able to treat patients without crisis care.
 "It's really about the capacity of our healthcare system, it's about the capacity of our testing and our contact tracing and how those numbers play out," said Sweet.
 As of Wednesday, there are 55 confirmed cases of the virus in Franklin. Numbers for how many have recovered are not released by the state.
 "The challenge with recovered numbers is that we don't have the manpower to figure that out," said Sweet. Officials use a disease surveillance and outbreak management system called Maven, which identifies cases to local health departments.
 "We're trying to track the people who have been ill and their contacts, so going back through the system to trace out 14 days for every ill person is too much manpower, and it's just too difficult right now with the priority being controlling the disease," she said.
 Chairman Tom Mercer said another meeting will likely be held at a later date to discuss the possibility of a mask mandate as more information from the state becomes available.
 So far, there are at least two local towns - Milford and Bellingham - and one MetroWest city - Framingham - that have ordered residents to wear masks in public.

The notorious, armor-clad, 19th century Australian bushranger (slang for rural outlaw) Ned Kelly had previously been portrayed onscreen by Mick Jagger ("Ned Kelly," 1970) and by Heath Ledger ("Ned Kelly," 2003). Neither of those films was particularly memorable. Now, here comes British rising star George MacKay, the long-faced lead actor in "1917," to sparklingly bring the character to life in what turns out to be the best, by far, of the three attempts to tell the story.
 But let's start with an important point: The beautiful and occasionally brutal film, from Australian director Justin Kurzel, bearing the much longer title "True History of the Kelly Gang," is not a "true history." Based on the Booker Prize-winning 2000 novel by Peter Carey, it, like the book, is a dramatic mix of fact and fiction that tells a fanciful version of the short life of Kelly from the age of 12 (terrifically played by Australian newcomer Orlando Schwerdt) to his final date with destiny 13 years later.

 I won't attempt to speculate what's true here and what isn't, because since the film is making no claims to it, it doesn't make any difference. Besides, what's up on the screen is both riveting and entertaining.
 Young Ned is first met growing up in a tin shack in a rural town north of Melbourne, the oldest of his siblings, with his mum, Ellen (Essie Davis), and dad, Red, all of them just eking by. Red (Ben Corbett) was a no-count loser who didn't provide for his family. Ellen, much to Red's consternation, earned money by selling her body to various male visitors, including the strapping but dastardly Sgt. O'Neil (Charlie Hunnam).
 After Red is removed from the story, Ellen, hoping to give Ned something of a future, works out a deal with an old friend, the smiling, rough and tumble scoundrel Harry Power (Russell Crowe in an extended, scene-stealing cameo), who takes the lad out on the road to teach him the ways of the world, which include keeping a journal "to write your own history" and how to kill people.
 Every performance in the film's first 40 minutes is right on the mark (Crowe even gets to sing!). But it's at that point, 10 years later in the story, that MacKay appears, bent backward, his head disconcertingly upside down, his adult Ned Kelly preparing for a bare-knuckle barroom fight, just before heading back home to his mum and grown siblings with hopes of becoming a farmer.
 But that hope doesn't materialize, and we know that part is true, that Ned will end up embracing a life of crime, due to a variety of reasons, people and circumstances. It's then that the film starts introducing many more characters. Of note are George King (the amazing Marlon Williams), the much- younger man - and cad - who is about to marry Ned's unbalanced mum, and who is training Ned's brothers to become thieves; the charming but heinous Constable Fitzpatrick (Nicholas Hoult), whose behavior eventually goes unhinged; and Mary Hearn (Thomasin McKenzie), a sweet young woman working at a local brothel.
 It would be simplest to say that this is an Australian art house Western, but it's chockful of cinematic and storytelling ingredients that pull it up above that category. It's about bad things happening to good people, and the revenge being sought because it of; it gets into people who are so driven by their goals, they start losing their marbles; and it offers explanations of why the bushrangers who became known as the Kelly Gang started donning dresses and armor before going into action.
 One outstanding visual highlight of the film occurs near the end, when the law is closing in on the gang, and the screen erupts in an eerie and bizarrely and beautifully photographed nighttime gunfight. But even that long sequence can't hold a candle to the bigger-than-life, make that gigantic, performance by George MacKay. He's been at his craft for quite a while, and he's now, finally, a star in the making.
 "True History of the Kelly Gang" will be available on most digital and cable platforms beginning April 24.

But after several weeks of this, and more than a month of closures and lockdowns in many parts of the country, we're now at a new and perhaps even more dangerous phase of the country's response to the coronavirus. We're starting to see the states and cities that want to be at the vanguard of opening back up again, amid protests that this whole thing is taking too long and warnings from public health experts that we're not actually out of the woods yet and that reopening now is too dangerous. Along those lines, there's a web tool built by the team at the PolicyLab at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia which makes the math as plain as it can be for you -- you can check here to get an estimate of what will happen in your area if leaders start relaxing social distancing guidelines in May, as has been proposed in a growing number of places around the US.

Although there are new policies in place due to COVID-19, officials with the Lower Thames Valley Conservation Authority expect to plant more trees this year than in 2019.
 Greg Van Every, the authority's environmental project co-ordinator, said close to 90,000 trees have been ordered for the watershed. The Lower Thames planted just under 71,000 seedlings last year, according to its annual report.
 He said the deadline to order trees was March 15, which was four days after the World Health Organization declared the global pandemic.
 "There have been quite a few people who have had cold feet and were asking, 'How am I going to do this?'" said Van Every. "But we've reassured them that it can be done and we're going to plow ahead."
 The conservation authority will be using two crews of three people each for its projects this year, he said. The first will have a tractor driver, a planter and a checker for the machine-planting sites. The other has three hand-planters "who will do the social-distancing thing and stay apart," said Van Every.
 "We wanted to have two separate crews in case somebody gets sick on one we don't have to shut down the whole thing," he said.
 For people who ordered trees but don't require any planting assistance, Lower Thames staff will deliver trees to their homes to minimize interaction, said Van Every.
 A nursery the conservation authority uses hires migrant workers. Van Every said it had trouble getting approval to bring in the workers, and they will have to isolate for 14 days once they arrive.
 "That delays a couple weeks on the spring schedule," he said. "We're just waiting to see how that plays out and whether we're going to be on time or not. So far, the scheduling looks like it shouldn't be too far out of the normal."
 Van Every said he is aiming to start planting the seedlings by April 27 and hopes to finish some time in June. There are also large stock trees between 150 and 200 centimetres in diameter that are already being used in projects, he said.
 "Dutton Dunwich and West Elgin both wanted to provide trees to their citizens, and so they bought some large stock trees to put out into the community," he said.
 West Elgin has a program to replace dead trees on residents' properties each year, according to Van Every.
 Among the larger projects are 14 acres of land owned by the Ridge Landfill and a 10-acre project in West Elgin, he said, but most of the projects are around 2.5 acres.
 Van Every said they plant about 600 trees per acre, which means the trees and the rows are set between 7.5 feet and 8 feet apart.
 "We expect that any given tree plantation will have 85 per cent survivability, so there might be 15 per cent that don't make it," he said.
 The Ridge Landfill Community Trust also announced a $1 million donation over a 10-year period to the authority last year to be used for tree-planting, as well as wetlands and grass habitat, in the South Kent area.
 Van Every said a few projects will be happening with those funds this year.

That brings me to something else too, which is that I have all this happiness. This happiness that I haven't had access to in so long, because of that feeling of "Oh my goodness, maybe I'm not just something that represents depression and sadness and dwelling and bad feelings." I feel understood finally and I feel so happy. And immediately I get this guarded feeling about all of the sadness that I've felt. Like I don't want to forget how that felt. This goes to something, too, about how my years of not being sober, of drinking so much -- you go through these times where you feel like "I am at the bottom, I want to die." And then you drink a bunch and then somehow you make it through and further along the line you get sad again and you're like "Yeah, I made it through before though, right?" But you don't really remember making it through before, because you were drunk, so you didn't really feel the sadness, you didn't really make it through.
