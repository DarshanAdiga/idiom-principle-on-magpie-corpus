Tis a great review. I'm really happy to hear how quiet the system is, especially since I'm acutely aware of even my Xbox One X these days. The only thing I would have like to have known that wasn't in the review is how fast moving from a USB 3.0 drive to the internal SSD is, as I'm sure that is to become a standard operation for most people.
