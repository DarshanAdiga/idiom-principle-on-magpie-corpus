I’ve had different role models throughout my life. Most recently, I’d say President Barack Obama was an inspiration because of where he came from. He had difficulties to deal with that many would have found insurmountable and he just decided to figure out a way to work with everyone. This is not a political statement, but just looking at the challenges he had to face with a Congress that was dead set on stopping him. He stayed positive about it, he never became sour grapes, he never got upset. He did get flustered from time to time but it takes a good temperament to not let it define you.

First and foremost be yourself. I know this is an industry where we take upon many roles that interpret many people, but at the end of the day it is your approach to certain roles that separates you from others. You will also encounter several rejections and pain. It’s just the way it is. Many people need to understand that we are trying out for someone else vision of a story. We must adapt ourselves to meet their vision and it’s not easy at times. Trial by fire, but when you get that yes, or that call, take advantage of it.

Made a major mistake assuming Joe Burrow could storm through the backdoor against the Ravens and their defense. I think Indy will be different -- their defense is good, but they are willing to let teams hang around by not closing out in the red zone and playing prevent/melting clock in the second half. That should be enough to let Joe Burrow sneak through the backdoor getting more than a touchdown. If Darius Leonard doesn't play, I love Joe Mixon's prop overs and using him in DFS. I love Jonathan Taylor props either way. Breakout game coming for him.

3) Learn the difference between people who will only like you when you can do something for them, versus the people who like you and believe in you for who you are. Again, there’s a ton of stories I could tell for this one, both positive and negative. One of my biggest lessons in this area was about becoming more discerning about when people express interest in me. Like a lot of other young women, I got a lot of attention from men when I was in my early 20s, men who always claimed to want to “help my career”. But when I started calling them out on their inappropriate behavior, when I got older and wiser, when I gained weight, and when I started saying no to things, a lot of those men would suddenly turn on me, or stop supporting me. It was a hard lesson, but at the end of the day it says a lot more about their (weak) characters than it does about the awesomeness that I bring to the table.

MISSOULA - The pandemic has changed so many holiday traditions this year and shopping this season is no exception.
 This year because of COVID-19 and all of the struggles small businesses and local restaurants and bars have faced, the Missoula Downtown Association has partnered with over 200 businesses to create 'Small Business Season' instead of just a weekend of deals.
 Small business season will go all the way until Dec. 23, 2020 and offer a variety of deals and safe events to give shoppers the opportunity to get out and shop on more than just one weekend. Downtown businesses are extending their hours of operation, offering special promotions and providing person touches and connections along the way.
 The slogan for this campaign is "Put your money where your heart is" and the Missoula Downtown Association will have a Shop & Dine Headquarters at the corner of Higgins and Main on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Nov. 28, Dec. 5 and 12.
 The association will be handing out coupons for free hot chocolate, branded shopping bags and handouts on the Downtown specials.
