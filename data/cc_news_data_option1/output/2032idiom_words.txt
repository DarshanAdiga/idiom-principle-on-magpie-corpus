But the reason the choice was at our feet was because you needed the sense of closure.

It gave the movie, on a simple level, the reality that while it may not feature as flamboyant or expensive action as some other movies, that the must see of the movie was going to be because it would be the end of a legend, he added.Jackman recently admitted he departed the X-Men franchise at the right time.He added that he is looking forward to some other actor take up the role in a potential new take.(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

"You see, Kohli - who is now 31 and at the peak of his career - has been in international cricket for over a decade and has proved himself in all conditions. The 70 international centuries that he has scored is a testimony to his class and abilities," Younis said.

"Babar, on the other hand, made his international debut barely five years back. He already has 16 centuries under his belt and shows very good averages in both Tests and ODIs, but it will be unfair to start comparing the two right now. If you have to, compare Babar five years (from now) with the dominance that Kohli is showing in his game today," he added.

Former England spinner Panesar foresees the start of the England-West Indies series making things a lot clearer for the entire fraternity than they are at the moment.The 14 day quarantine is very much needed and well done to the ICC for including that. I think we will see resumption of international cricket with England hosting West Indies in July. We might have some practical ideas then, the other countries would also be watching keenly and will learn how to go about it.But measures like regular hand sanitising is not going to be practical. May be you could sanitise every one hour but it cant be regular during the game, said Panesar.While Pathan feels the on-field safety measures will make managing over-rate a bigger challenge for teams, Chopra said no loo or shower breaks during training wont be that much of an issue.Training is still controllable. You dont have to be there for a long time but you would still have to use the restroom at some stage. You may avoid taking a shower but you will have to use the restroom.I think the idea of these guidelines is to make cricketers more aware that you have to take care of yourself and inculcate habits which are in everyones interest in the current scenario, added Chopra.(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

If the team is going through a 14-day quarantine and is being tested for COVID-19, I am fine with that process. Now, after that, if we have more guidelines for the players during the game, then you are making things complicated. Then there is no point of a quarantine period, former India pacer Pathan told PTI.Safety cannot be compromised but regularly sanitising hands during the game will be too much to ask from the players.Safety is paramount but we should not make the game complicated. If a bowler or fielder has to sanitise hands every time he touches the ball, then it would be very difficult.You can shorten the process of giving the ball to the bowler. Instead of the usual chain (wicket-keeper to cover fielder to bowler), the keeper can straight away give the ball to the bowler but even then the bowler will have to sanitise hands six times in an over, said Pathan seeking more clarity on the guidelines.Former India opener Chopra said it is still pre- mature to prepare a fixed set of guidelines for resumption of cricket as the situation is evolving every day.That (regular hand sanitisation after contact with ball) is obviously impractical but my big question is when the game happens in a bio secure environment and everyone is quarantined and tested, do these additional measures make a difference?
