Rumors are swirling once again that the Cleveland Browns are looking shopping Odell Beckham Jr., and Fox Sports Radio host Colin Cowherd is downright giddy about the situation, both backing the report with an anonymous source and using the opportunity to take a shot at the Browns.
 Cowherd isn't much of a news-breaker, but the noted talking head did gain some notoriety this offseason for being one of the first to report that Tom Brady was heading to Tampa Bay. Here's what Cowherd had to say on the Beckham situation, saying his source told him, "OBJ wants out."
 "You know the source who gave me the 'Tom Brady to Tampa Bay' story? The same source just texted me, 'OBJ wants out.' He's been a good soldier and he's not going to make a big deal. He'll deny it and he wants to get along with everybody," Cowherd said on Wednesday. "OBJ has been a very good soldier in Cleveland. Has he been projecting on Instagram? Yeah, because he's in the middle of nowhere and he's a superstar. Let's just say this - OBJ will not go public, and he knows Minnesota is a good place and he knows it's a good fit. I'm just going to leave it at that."

What concerns me most is the manner in which we take photographs these days. Those old black-and-white photos from 100 years ago are just as clear today as when they were taken.
 Color photos taken between 1955 and 1995, however, are already beginning to fade and should be scanned and digitized. They can be saved.
 But digitizing old photos also presents a problem. Where will they be stored? On your cellphone? On a CD? In the “cloud”? When you’re gone, your digital photos will be gone, too.
 That brings us to the way we take photos today—almost exclusively on our cellphones. More and more, people don’t bother to make prints from their digital files. They just keep them on their phones until their storage is full and then they either put them on some kind of a drive or delete them.
 The friend that I spoke of at the beginning of this column found his picture in an old box. Future generations will never find your cellphone photos in an old box. In fact, they likely won’t find them at all. At some point, they will just disappear into cyberspace.
 Another problem is with identifications. Unless you create a Shutterfly-type book or actually make prints, there will be no way to identify each photo. You can’t write on the back of a digital file in your cellphone or out there in cyberspace.
 Remember, too, that technology changes about once a week. CDs might be as foreign in 2050 as VHS tapes are now. How you store family photos is a continuing challenge.
 But if you’re bored right now, go through those old family photos and identify them with a notation on the back. You may be helping some researching grandchild down the road.
 Oh, and print the information. Future generations that see cursive might think it is a foreign language.
 That’s the world we live in.

Since the coronavirus, since COVID-19, I am constantly being told to wash my hands.
   
 Kill that virus, they say. Wash away that which might be there or maybe not, those minuscule invisibles that can kill the vulnerable and threaten everyone simply by existing.
   
 Kill that virus.
   
 With water, lots of water and soap.
   
 Any kind of soap.
   
 And I do.
   
 Never thought much about soap. Took it for granted. Now, soap has become a necessary part of my life, soap is my new best friend.
   
 Like the sliver sitting beside my kitchen sink. It's aqua blue, Caribbean blue like the water near beaches on Nassau, translucent, flat and round as a miniature pancake, innocently resting in a pewter saucer with not a single anti-virus molecule to offer. They tell me that doesn't matter. It's the scrubbing, the rinsing that counts, 22 seconds long.
   
 When I wash my hands at the bathroom sink, that bar of soap makes all sorts of bubbles that take forever to rinse off. I never noticed that before. Beaucoup bubbles. That's good, right?
   
 There are three bars of soap in my shower, plus the last dregs of my bottle of Badedas, a German gel I have used since 1954. Known in the States as Vitabath, we order it online, pricey so I use it sparingly.
   
 I gave up sweet-smelling liquid soap that comes in a pump bottle ages ago because it made the shower floor like black ice. It is downright difficult, if not impossible, to hang onto a rail with one hand and wash with the other all the time hoping your feet won't swoosh out from under you. That happened to my friend Lucy. She fell on slippery soap and was never the same after.
   
 All of my soaps are getting smaller and smaller, thinner and thinner. Disappearing down the drain.
   
 Cappi gave me a soap that was "Hawaii." When I rubbed it between my hands and the perfume, that lovely flowery perfume unique to the islands, met the air, the years were gone and I was back in the land where flip flops were called zories, muumuus the dress of the day and neighbors left mangos on your dining room table. What had been a gracious-sized bar is now dime-thin and inch-wide.
   
 That littlest piece stays on the shower step next to a bar of Octagon. People from up north call it brown soap, that most necessary of soaps in the Lowcountry, a killer of red bugs, remover of persistent stains, not even close to smelling sweet.
   
 And the third bar of soap in the shower? It's oval, scent almost gone, slick as a baby in its first bath, so if it falls you have to dig in a fingernail to pick it up.
   
 I could let it go and not fret the first minute, put it under the sink with the half bottles of peroxide and alcohol, the box of Rid that keeps my septic tank happy and the rest of the unmentionables that found their way into that dark storage place. I'd never miss it.
   
 But I won't. It will stay in my shower until it dissolves and disappears. Or more likely, when it gets to about that certain size, I'll bring in a new bar delightfully perfumed under the wrapper, unwieldy, not yet adjusted to my hand, a reluctant replacement.
   
 There are all sorts of soaps in my past, Lifebuoy, pronounced Lifeboy, a weird shade of orange, strange astringent odor, first time we had ever heard anyone talk about a deodorant soap. Daddy loved it. He was the only one in the family who did. Even so, he didn't use it for shaving. For that he kept a mug with a special herbal-scented soap that would have pleased Charles Atlas, Daddy's hero.
   
 Mama loved Cashmere Bouquet, a delicate soap that was the first milled soap, patented by the Colgate company in 1872 and the closest she could come to her favorite scent, lily of the valley. They don't make this longtime favorite anymore and it has become a collector's item.
   
 As a little boy, my brother Martin liked Ivory because it floated, and he could scoot it around the bathtub like a toy boat.
   
 I remember Ivory soap, but in a different way. I can't imagine what badge we were working on, maybe Accident Prevention, but at one Girl Scout Troop 18 monthly meeting, we sat around the table with a paring knife carving on a bar of Ivory soap. I had visions of a bear sculpture but ended up with a pile of shavings and something that resembled nothing.
   
 Through the years I have touted the virtues of Dr. Bronner's Pure Castile Liquid Soap and wish I had some. I'm out. I am a fan of Pears soap, the world's first mass-marketed translucent soap dating back to 1807. The Dollar Store sells it.
   
 I like any of Yardley's soaps, especially their Lavender.
   
 Erno Laszlo's Sea Mud Soap, his famous black bar that guarantees more than you can ever expect from washing your face with a soap made with mud.
   
 And then there is Irish Spring, the strongest stink-sweet smell of them all.
   
 Whatever soap you have, whether designer soaps from Santa or one of those teeny soaps left over from your last hotel visit, this is the time to come along with me, join in, adopt the mantra that will help to eliminate this invisible scourge COVID-19.
   
 WTH: Wash The Hands.
   
 And if you are able…
   
 Stay home.
   
 Please.

Malone eventually became the nemesis of Madam C. J. Walker, as well as the villainess (Addie Monroe) in "Self Made," which made me feel sad since Malone started her business in Brooklyn, Illinois. In the early 1900s, Malone moved with her older siblings to Brooklyn, then known as Lovejoy, in St. Clair County. While experimenting with hair and different hair-care products, Malone developed and manufactured her own line of non-damaging hair straighteners, special oils and hair-stimulant products for African-American women. Her products and sales began to revolutionize hair-care methods for all African Americans.

School District No. 67 would like to thank our local community for donations that have ensured our schools have been able to run breakfast programs so that no child starts their school day without having access to food in the morning.
 Given that schools are not providing face to face instruction, School District No. 67 is seeking new ways to support children in need who no longer are able to access our breakfast program. Schools reached out to every student’s family after the return from Spring Break, which provided a good opportunity to check in with families to see how they were coping with the change of events due to COVID-19. Those phone calls revealed that there is an increase in the number of students who are now struggling with food insecurity due to these uncertain economic times.
 School District No. 67 would like to continue to support our students and their families who have identified this need by providing simple weekly food hampers filled with a few basic non-perishable food items along with some baked goods made in school kitchens by our staff. We also will continue to facilitate the Starfish backpack program in Penticton and the Penny Lane backpack program in Summerland.
 This service is made possible by the ongoing support of community members who have donated in the past to our breakfast programs. Anyone wishing to support this renewed initiative is welcome to do so. Financial donations can be made in the form of a cheque payable to School District No. 67 and dropped off at the School Board Office at 425 Jermyn Avenue through the mail slot. For those wishing to donate to the Food Hamper program by e-transfer, please send your donation to: accountsreceivable@summer.com. For the security question/answer please use What city do we live in? with the answer of Penticton.

Reducing the Mercy’s capacity, he said, won’t hurt its ability to relieve local hospitals. “From the perspective of our partners here in L.A., they won’t see any difference in what we’re able to do for the local area,” he said.
 The changes come as the Mercy works to overcome a small outbreak of the virus. Seven crew members have tested positive, and about 112 were taken off the ship and quarantined because they had contact with someone who tested positive.
 There have been no new cases of the virus among the ship’s crew since Sunday, Rotruck said, adding that several staff have already been able to return to duty. He said officials have not determined how the virus got on board the ship, but noted that many of the staff came from around the region and could have been carrying the virus but not showing symptoms when they arrived.
 Rotruck said the ship will remain in L.A. for as long as needed, and there are no plans right now to leave.

The Guatemalan government had asked the United States to not send more than 25 deportees per flight, to give them health exams before departure and to certify that they were not infected. But on Monday the U.S. sent nearly 200 deportees aboard two planes.
 ICE does not typically disclose details about how and when it removes people but says there was an April 14 flight to Guatemala that left from San Antonio with 112 people on board. All were medically cleared before takeoff. The agency says any detainee with a temperature of 100.4 degrees or higher is not allowed to board a flight and is sent for further evaluation and observation.
 U.S. Immigration Customs Enforcement said Wednesday the total number of detainees who have tested positive rose to 89, with 15 at the privately run Otay Mesa Detention Center in San Diego. The United States holds about 34,000 people in immigration detention, down from about 37,000 last month.
 Since March 13, when Guatemala declared a health emergency, the Guatemalan Immigration Institute says that more than 1,600 deportees have arrived from the U.S. including 245 minors.

The ship left San Diego on March 23 and arrived in Los Angeles four days later to provide relief by taking patients who were not infected with the virus.
 Many of the worst outbreaks now occurring are in nursing facilities, and some are having staffing issues as workers are infected or stay home.
 Rotruck said there has been no final decision, but 250 beds would be a reasonable size to maintain. He said that “probably in the neighborhood of 100 or more people” could be made available for other missions, as a result of the reduction in beds. He said no decisions have been made on where medical staff may go.
 “I’m not surprised if it happens,” he said, adding that 51 patients have been treated on the ship since it arrived and 17 were on board as of Wednesday. The ship has seen an average of 20 to 21 people a day.

Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said Javier Hernandez's place in their XI was not negotiable, after another productive performance from the Mexico international.
 Making just his third La Liga start this season, Hernandez fired in a brace in Real's 4-2 win at Celta Vigo on Sunday - which took the European champions to within two points of pacesetters Barcelona with five games to play.
 Hernandez has scored four goals in as many appearances in all competitions, crucially firing in the winner to send Real into the UEFA Champions League semi-finals.
 Ancelotti said Hernandez had played himself into a starting spot.
 "Chicharito is enjoying himself and keeping his momentum. He's being really helpful for the team," Ancelotti said.
 "As for the rest, I thought they did great - it is true we struggled at certain moments but it's also true that we were really efficient attacking.
 "Playing at the level he is right now, Chicharito's place in the team isn't negotiable.
 "Same applies for [Karim] Benzema, [Gareth] Bale, [Cristiano] Ronaldo, James [Rodriguez], Isco, [Sergio] Ramos, Pepe, [Raphael] Varane.
 "As I said I count on a team that isn't negotiable.
 "Only 11 players can play at the same time and the rest sit on the bench."
 Toni Kroos and James were Real's other goal-scorers, in a fluctuating game in Vigo.
 Celta led early but went into half-time trailing 3-2, before Hernandez sealed the three points with his 69th-minute goal.
 "We enjoyed playing offensively and taking risks. Celta played this way also. In the end it was an attractive game for the fans," Ancelotti said.
 On the title race, the Italian added: "For the time being we don't think about what other teams do. We are only focused on our duties.
 "We are doing well after the defeat against Barcelona. We try to be in contention for the title until the very end. That's our objective."

Milton is a beautiful town and a great place to live. We have great schools, great parks, and great neighborhoods with wonderful neighbors and leaders who have always lived up to our moral responsibilities. We demonstrated that when we pledged to make education a priority and we provided our children with new schools. Let's not stop there - we have more work to do.
 Housing is a necessity. Living up to our responsibilities means we look for ways to adhere to rules requiring that a certain percentage of our housing meets the state's 10 percent affordable housing guidelines. Currently, our town is far under that threshold. In fact, Milton's housing stock is just at five percent affordable. Let's work together to boost that number to the 10 percent required by the state. We are not alone in taking care of our responsibilities.
 The Falconi family and J. Joseph Corcoran Company - local developers who care about the neighborhood and our community - are looking to build much-needed housing on an underutilized property in East Milton Square. The town has designated that parcel as a preferred site for increased density and possible housing expansion, in line with a master plan for the redesign of the deck over I-93.
 The Corcoran/Falconi project, the Residences at East Milton, coupled with the town's approved master plan to redevelop and improve East Milton Square, will help keep the neighborhood a pedestrian-friendly shopping and retail district. It will take a big step toward helping the town meet its affordable housing requirement while creating density to support our retail businesses.
 In all, 25 percent of the 111 units at the site will be deemed affordable, meaning that a single person making approximately $63,000 a year - such as a new teacher, police officer, firefighter or State Street employee - will qualify. The other 75 percent will be market rate. The development will create quality new units for young couples, single professionals and empty nesters looking to downsize but stay in Milton. It will also create opportunities for our young people returning from college who can't afford to live in the town where they grew up. We need this type of new housing so our children don't lose the opportunity to live, support and thrive in the community they love.
 The Residences at East Milton will bring in residents who would rather walk to local restaurants, the grocery store, pharmacy and other services, which will add to the vibrancy of the town's greatest commercial asset without additional traffic and parking concerns.
 Other proposed 40B developments in town are not near commercial amenities and will increase density in rural neighborhoods, while adding vehicles to the overall traffic flow across town and in East Milton especially.
 Milton's tax base is painfully reliant on residents. Supporting local businesses in East Milton Square, as this development will do, will ensure that the area remains a thriving economic hub that will fuel the city's tax coffers for many years to come. Without more diverse housing opportunities in East Milton Square, the neighborhood will suffer and taxpayers will pay more in the long run. Already we see how Amazon and other big box stores put small retail out of business. The mom and pop stores in East Milton need residents who will shop local.
 Supporting smart, targeted development in East Milton Square will meet the town's obligations, comply with the towns' own master plan and help Milton grow responsibly.

There was also the possibility that they were they simply some of his parents’ friends and they were no relation at all.
 This happens all the time. Somebody digs up an old photo with no identification and starts a frantic hunt to figure out who the people were. Much of the time, those who would know are all dead and the photo ends up being thrown in the trash.
 If you’re looking for a project to keep you busy during this quarantine period, go through those old photographs and put names and dates on the back. If the photo was taken in front of a family home, you might also want to include that.
 As a historian, I am often frustrated when I find a vintage photo with no identification. Who were those people?
 We take it for granted that everyone knows Aunt Emma and Uncle Bill, but three generations down the road, your grandkids’ kids won’t have a clue. Most, of course, won’t care until they get older, and by then, everyone who knew the people in the photograph will likely be dead. The picture will then become an unsolved mystery.
 Sometime back, I wrote a column about taking a bunch of old family photographs and having them made into a Shutterfly book. I made copies for each of my children and the total cost was about $100.
 I included identifications with each photo and made clear how the person or persons were related. If the person was just a good friend, I noted that, too. And if there was a building in the background, I also provided a bit of information on that.
 If your parents were divorced, include and identify step-parents and even those relatives you don’t like. They may mean something to future generations.

The Lifeproof FRĒ Series case is a heavy-duty defender case whose claim to fame is a fully waterproof design that is sealed off by the inclusion of a built-in screen protector and rubber port covers. But unlike the original iPhone SE, the iPhone SE 2020 is IP67-rated for water resistance, so it doesn't exactly need any extra waterproofing. Still, that doesn't change the fact that this case's airtight design is great for protecting your phone from drops and scratches.
 Its shock-proof material exceeds military-grade drop test standards and its raised bumper frame design creates a protective bezel around your SE 2020's front screen and rear camera. Surprisingly, it still works with wireless charging too. The main downside to watch out for on this case is that its watertight seal partially muffles your phone's microphone, which some users have claimed affects call quality. Even if it does, this is a small price to pay for the comprehensive protection that the Lifeproof FRĒ offers.

 As a little boy, my brother Martin liked Ivory because it floated, and he could scoot it around the bathtub like a toy boat.
 I remember Ivory soap, but in a different way. I can't imagine what badge we were working on, maybe Accident Prevention, but at one Girl Scout Troop 18 monthly meeting, we sat around the table with a paring knife carving on a bar of Ivory soap. I had visions of a bear sculpture but ended up with a pile of shavings and something that resembled nothing.
 Through the years I have touted the virtues of Dr. Bronner's Pure Castile Liquid Soap and wish I had some. I'm out. I am a fan of Pears soap, the world's first mass-marketed translucent soap dating back to 1807. The Dollar Store sells it.
 I like any of Yardley's soaps, especially their Lavender.
 Erno Laszlo's Sea Mud Soap, his famous black bar that guarantees more than you can ever expect from washing your face with a soap made with mud.
 And then there is Irish Spring, the strongest stink-sweet smell of them all.

 And if you are able...

But he understands the confusion among his constituents. For example, he has been questioned about why the can company in Fort Madison remains in operation during the COVID-19 crisis.
 “Well, they have to have a way to package the food,” Taylor said. “The prisons? We can’t just let the prisoners go home. A lot of time it has something to do with healthcare or the food supply. For farmers, the part stores have to stay open for them.”
 Taylor was also asked about the governor’s proclamation versus Shelter in Place orders. Iowa is in the handful of states that have not called for a Shelter in Place order.
 While he said “we could go a bit further,” he supported the governor’s actions.
 “We’re not going to stop this virus. A Shelter in Place won’t stop this virus. We can only slow it,” he said. “In my opinion, I think we’re doing a pretty good job. I sure wouldn’t want to be the governor in this situation. I think we all need to stand behind her and allow her to do what she thinks is best.”
 During the COVID-19 crisis, some have taken off work due to health concerns or to care for children, but does their job protection and, in some cases their wages, end on April 30 at the end of the governor’s closure orders.
 “It’s up to the governor. If she lifts the order, I would say your protection would run out maybe 7 to 10 days from then.”
 Taylor has been a longtime advocate for funding mental health resources and when asked about the impact he foresees because of the COVID-19 crisis, Taylor said, it has been “put on the back burner.”
 “Mental health, and most everything else, except the virus, have been put on hold,” he said, adding that getting mental health services after the COVID-19 crisis eases “will be a lot harder” because of high demand and COVID-19-related delays.
 Taylor also indicated he doubts Iowa schools will re-open on May 1, and said most Iowa schools are offering online learning that will prevent the need for summer school.
 “Or, they could go back to school. The governor could order it, but I don’t see that happening.”
 The LCEDG is holding two more Zoom conference calls in the upcoming week. On Thursday they will be talking with Sen. Charles Grassley and on Wednesday, April 22, Sen. Joni Ernst.

McMahon’s grand plan, however, quickly changed; not so much because of the XFL’s viability but because his main business — the WWE — is floundering. The fact is that McMahon’s net worth is tied almost exclusively to the WWE’s stock value, which has plummeted during the past year. On April 16, 2019, WWE stock was selling for $98 a share; now it’s at $39. Forbes estimates McMahon’s net worth is now at about $1.9 billion, a precipitous drop from the $3.3 billion when he first announced he was resurrecting the XFL in 2018.
 The WWE, in a cost-cutting move, laid off many of its producers and nearly 35 wrestlers on Wednesday. And now we know why McMahon and the WWE are so determined to start live wrestling shows from right here in Orlando even amid the coronavirus pandemic. It’s because they need to slow the financial bleeding.

Borussia Dortmund head to Hoffenheim in a buoyant mood after edging rivals Bayern Munich to reach the DFB-Pokal final on Tuesday.
 Dortmund made a miserable start to the season and sat bottom of the table on more than one occasion, but the cup may provide light at the end of the tunnel, if they can beat Wolfsburg in the May 30 final.
 It could also provide outgoing coach Jurgen Klopp with the perfect swansong to his excellent stint in charge at the German giants, which has brought about two Bundesliga titles and a run to the UEFA Champions League final in 2013.
 Bayern missed all four penalties in a shootout to end Tuesday's semi-final, leaving Dortmund elated, but CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke has urged the team to move on quickly ahead of a crucial Bundesliga clash on Saturday.
 Schalke and Augsburg, fifth and sixth respectively, occupy the UEFA Europa League spots for next season with 42 points. Hoffenheim sit seventh with 40, while Dortmund are one place and one point adrift.
 "It was exciting," Watzke told Dortmund's official website. "Jurgen Klopp's dream of taking the bus to the Borsigplatz [main square in Dortmund to celebrate] goes on.
 "But first we've got to travel to Hoffenheim in the Bundesliga. It'll be an extremely important game in the race to reach the Europa League."
 The likes of Werder Bremen and Mainz also remain in contention for a Europa League spot, so, with just four matches of the season remaining, Saturday's clash is vital in every sense of the word.
 Dortmund have grown accustomed to European football in recent years and qualifying for continental competition would represent an excellent result given their start to the season.
 Those chances looked shot after consecutive league defeats to Bayern and Borussia Monchengladbach, but wins over Paderborn and Eintracht Frankfurt have lifted spirits.
 Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Shinji Kagawa scored in both of those victories.
 Australia goalkeeper Mitchell Langerak - so impressive against Bayern in the DFB-Pokal - will continue in goal for Dortmund as Roman Weidenfeller (pelvis) remains on the sidelines.
 Hoffenheim's form is far worse, with a winless run of six matches in all competitions - which included a cup quarter-final defeat to Dortmund in extra time - ended by a 2-1 success at Hannover last time out.
 Dortmund have won both meetings between the two sides this season, with their cup success preceded by a 1-0 league win in December that came thanks to Ilkay Gundogan's strike.
 Hoffenheim's last victory against Dortmund was a memorable one.
 Needing all three points on the final day of the 2012-13 season to secure a relegation play-off - which they would ultimately win against Kaiserslautern - Hoffenheim came from behind to win 2-1 at Signal-Iduna Park thanks to Sejad Salihovic's brace of penalties.

Seaton said, “The favorite part of my job is working with hotels and attractions to elevate Edmond and bring new visitors to our amazing city.”
 She grew up in Medina, Ohio, and earned her Bachelors of Communications and Master of Arts from Ohio University.
 Prior to joining the Visit Edmond staff, Seaton worked at the Oklahoma Blood Institute, United Way of Central Oklahoma, Greater Oklahoma City Chamber, and Staplegun Advertising.
 She has three children: Nathan, 20, Becca, 19, and 10-year-old Gabe.
 Her favorite meal is sushi and she enjoys watching any 80’s movie.
 Once the quarantine is lifted Seaton said she plans to take her children out to eat at Edmond Railyard restaurants, shop at local stores, and have fun at Edmond attractions like Blocworks.
 The thing she misses most about being quarantined, “I miss seeing my staff and community partners face to face,” Seaton said.

When I see him now in Charlotte, he’ll say hi and we'll catch up because he doesn’t do interviews obviously.

Rotruck said there has been no final decision, but 250 beds would be a reasonable size to maintain. He said that “probably in the neighborhood of 100 or more people” could be made available for other missions, as a result of the reduction in beds. He said no decisions have been made on where medical staff may go.
 “I'm not surprised if it happens,” he said, adding that 51 patients have been treated on the ship since it arrived and 17 were on board as of Wednesday. The ship has seen an average of 20 to 21 people a day.
 Reducing the Mercy's capacity, he said, won't hurt its ability to relieve local hospitals. “From the perspective of our partners here in L.A., they won't see any difference in what we're able to do for the local area," he said.
 The changes come as the Mercy works to overcome a small outbreak of the virus. Seven crew members have tested positive, and about 112 were taken off the ship and quarantined because they had contact with someone who tested positive.
 There have been no new cases of the virus among the ship's crew since Sunday, Rotruck said, adding that several staff have already been able to return to duty. He said officials have not determined how the virus got on board the ship, but noted that many of the staff came from around the region and could have been carrying the virus but not showing symptoms when they arrived.
 Rotruck said the ship will remain in L.A. for as long as needed, and there are no plans right now to leave.

Apples newly launched iPhone brings back the concept of the compact smartphone which are as powerful as the flagship offerings. The iPhone SE 2020 with a starting price of Rs. 42,500 might not be an affordable smartphone, but it is an affordable flagship smartphone especially considering the brand value associated with the device.If you want an iPhone with the budget price tag, models like the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 8 looks a lot like the iPhone SE 2020 and costs significantly less. However, if you want the latest iPhone with features like A13 Bionic, the iPhone SE is the device to consider, which is likely to receive at least four major iOS updates.iPhone SE Could Stir Up The marketOnePlus was known for offering flagship smartphones at an affordable price tag. However, the company has been increasing the price every year and the OnePlus 8 and the OnePlus 8 Pro are the most expensive smartphones from the brand, which costs as much as other flagship smartphones from Apple and Samsung.With the starting price of $699, the OnePlus 8 is no more an affordable flagship or flagship killer, as the iPhone SE with the latest specs just costs $399 or Rs. 42,500, making it an excellent offering.OnePlus is likely to keep the price of the iPhone SE in mind when announcing the prices of the OnePlus 8 and the OnePlus 8 Pro. The company is likely to undercut the price of the OnePlus 8 to the OnePlus SE and it might cost around Rs. 40,999 or even Rs. 39,999.The OnePlus 8 Pro will be an expensive smartphone and is likely to be priced in the vicinity of Rs. 55,000. Not just OnePlus, a lot of smartphone makers will think twice before launching a flagship smartphone around Rs. 40,000. The upcoming Xiaomi Mi 10 might also have an impact due to the launch of the Apple iPhone SE.Most of the upcoming affordable flagship smartphones now have to compete against the Apple iPhone SE and this device is likely to sell like hotcakes once the COVID-19 situation gets better. Just like Android flagship killers, Apple is now beating them in their own game offering high-end hardware specs at a good price tag.iPhone SE Has Some ShortcomingsThe Apple iPhone SE is great for several reasons like the longevity of software support, superior processor, and premium build quality. However, it does not match with the 2020 standards.It does have thick bezels on the top of the bottom part of the screen with a lower screen-to-body ratio. Even though the display supports HDR 10 and DolbyVision, it is still a 720p IPS LCD panel. Lastly, it uses Touch ID instead of Face ID which could be a deal-breaker for some.However, some people might just buy the iPhone SE just for the aforementioned features, especially those who are coming from devices like the original iPhone SE or the iPhone 6S.

Not to put too fine a point on it, but there were _a lot_ of ladies out there kicking ass throughout the 1990s, and that seemed to be very appealing to the audience.
