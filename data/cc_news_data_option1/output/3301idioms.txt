 Capitol Beat News Service
 ATLANTA – Traffic is back to pre-pandemic levels in most of Georgia, state Commissioner of Transportation Russell McMurry reported Thursday.
 With the economy steadily reopening, the flow of cars and trucks along Georgia’s rural roads and interstate highways is back to normal, McMurry told members of the State Transportation Board during its monthly meeting Thursday. In fact, truck traffic is actually above normal in some parts of the state, he said.
 Only in metro Atlanta is traffic still down significantly from levels seen before March, when the coronavirus pandemic hit the state and prompted Gov. Brian Kemp to issue a statewide stay-at-home order. That mandate has since been lifted for all but Georgians in long-term care facilities and those with chronic medical conditions.
 Because the metro region accounts for such a large percentage of the vehicles plying Georgia highways, traffic flow statewide is still down 10% to 15% on average, McMurry said. Traffic across the state plummeted by up to half at the height of the economic lockdown.
 McMurry said it’s still unclear how much the reopening of schools for the fall semester will affect traffic flows. He said he would know more by the time he reports back to the transportation board next month.

A policy change from the Indiana Department of Corrections (DOC) could lead to higher expenses at the Grant County Jail in 2021, according to Sheriff Reggie Nevels.
 At the first of four scheduled 2021 budget hearings Wednesday night, Nevels told Grant County Council non-salary budget items were planned to be exactly the same as 2020 for his department, but he was informed Wednesday by the Indiana Department of Corrections (DOC) that the DOC will not be accepting any sentenced inmates from county jails into its intake facility for the time being due to COVID-19.
 According to Nevels, there are currently 18 male and three female inmates at the Grant County Jail that have been sentenced and are awaiting transport to DOC facilities to complete their sentence, but for the time being the county will have to continue to pay to keep them at the jail. Nevels said DOC does reimburse counties $37.50 per day per inmate held at county jails that should be at DOC facilities, but it does not completely cover the expenses the county could incur.
 “DOC does reimburse the counties, but it’s still being a burden on the taxpayers here plus the burden of being overcrowded,” Nevels said.
 To accommodate the expected increase, Nevels requested and council approved an increase in the jail medical and hospital line item from $400,000 to $430,000 and an increase in the jail meals line item from $500,000 to $550,000. He said he hopes the DOC will change course and that he will not have to use the additional funds so he could return it to the general fund, but if things continue as they are now it will probably be necessary.
 Nevels said while salaries will be negotiated between council and the sheriff’s department union, the department is requesting 5 percent salary raises across the board for department employees.
 In other business, Emergency Management Agency Director Bob Jackson requested a new $10,000 line item in his budget for communications, stating his department’s radios are more than 10 years old and most have battery issues that make them unable to be taken off a charger and into the field for emergencies. He also requested a new $5,000 line item for equipment within capital outlays to purchase sign boards and other equipment to be used to alert motorists of emergencies ahead and/or to be used at COVID-19 testing sites.
 Council President Shane Middlesworth said he would prefer if Jackson tried to seek reimbursement through CARES Act money to purchase the radios and sign boards before including it in the 2021 budget.
 “If it’s in your budget it’s hard to get reimbursed because of COVID because you know it’s already established in a fund, so that’s something to keep in mind,” he said.
 Jackson said the signs would definitely be an allowable expense to be reimbursed with CARES Act funds, but communications items like radios are “a bit of a stretch” and are not always approved as allowable CARES Act expenses.
 Council voted to approve the EMA budget without the additional $15,000 from the new line items and also kept the garage and motors account at $12,500 rather than the requested $15,000. Jackson said he would seek CARES Act reimbursement first and report back to council, and Auditor Jim McWhirt said he could always come back for an additional appropriation at a later date if the CARES Act request was denied.
 Before beginning review with department heads and elected officials, McWhirt said the county would have a Dec. 31, 2021 projected operating balance of approximately $1.057 million in the county’s General, Health, Reassessment and Cumulative Bridge funds if all budgets were adopted as presented. He advised the county should strive for a bit of a higher operating balance in order to have a cushion and so funds are available for the 2022 budget as well.
 At the budget hearings, department heads present their budgets and answer any questions from council, and council typically takes action to approve all budgets except for those dealing with the salary and benefits of personnel. In addition to the sheriff's department and EMA, council reviewed and approved the non-salary portion of the county clerk, health department, coroner, recorder and prosecutor departments’ budgets.
 Budget hearings continued Thursday night and are scheduled to conclude next Wednesday and Thursday, Aug. 26 and 27.

In the United States, most police unions include within their mission statements the goal of enhancing the quality of life for the people they serve through enforcing the law, preserving peace, protecting the people, and maintaining order. Fortunately, many police and law enforcement officials adhere to those principles and apply them equally to all citizens regardless of race or ethnicity. In some instances, however, we find those tasked to protect and serve fall short in the pursuit of these goals.

On February 26, 2012, a 17 year old African American student named Trayvon Martin was on his way to visit relatives. He carried Skittles he had just purchased at a local convenience store in his pocket, and shielded himself from the rain in a hoodie. George Zimmerman, an armed 28 year old man and coordinator for his neighborhood watch, began following Martin while he walked through the gated community of The Retreat at Twin Lakes in Sanford, FL. Martin was living with his father’s fiancée at the Retreat at the time. Zimmerman had been known to make multiple calls to the police about “suspicious activity” in the neighborhood by people he identified as Black. Zimmerman felt Martin did not belong in the community. Zimmerman, called the Sanford police, described the teen a “suspicious guy”, remarked that “this guy looks like he is up to no good or he is on drugs or something”, and stated “these assholes, they always get away.” It is believed that Martin began trying to avoid Zimmerman. Zimmerman pursued him by car, then on foot, an argument and altercation ensued, which culminated with Zimmerman fatally shooting Martin 70 yards away from where Martin was staying. A coroner’s report revealed one single “contact” gunshot, yet only an abrasion on Martin’s left hand.

POCATELLO — A 21-year-old Pocatello man is facing a felony charge in Bannock County after he allegedly threatened another man with a gun and "pistol whipped" him.
 Evan L. Gardipee has been charged with aggravated battery, according to Magistrate Court records. A hearing that will determine if there is enough evidence to take his case to trial has been set for Sept. 1.
 The incident took place in the area of 1900 S. Fifth Ave. on Wednesday evening.
 Officers responded to multiple reports of a man, later identified as Gardipee, walking around a trailer court waiving a firearm, according to court records. Witnesses believed he may have been under the influence at that time.

Feel bad for Herbie. Well, not really. But the sad sack of Saratoga continues to make mention of my appearances on WNYT-13 and now the OTB Channel. Am afraid that Herbie is just a tad jealous. It's OK, Herbie, to admit that you also want to get some face time on the tube. The only problem is that you would be brutal if you were to appear on television. Herbie will argue that he once was on the "Captain Kangaroo" show when he was a tyke and fed a carrot to a bunny rabbit. Or when mama and papa Affrunti took him into the studio at News 12 Long Island for their science extravaganza back in the 1990s. Herbie represented Garden City High and failed miserably when his homemade quicksand experiment caused two cameras, an antenna and a weekend weatherman to disappear into Herbie's do-it-yourself goo. Herbie also had a short-lived TV show with his friends Head Gator, Head Frog and Head Woodpecker on a Long Island cable access station just last year. Predictably, it was canceled when reviews said Herbie's banter with his super friends just didn't cut it. Keep up your snide remarks, Herbie. We all know you secretly pine to have the glitter and lights that I have. Maybe I'll ask Rodger Wyland to do a story about Herbie and his carrot garden up here.

That story is on today’s front page.
 Just outside the newspaper’s reach, Logan County, which has been struggling against spread of the disease, added 38 cases, pushing its overall total to 418. Students in Logan County will start the school year with remote lessons due to the high rate of coronavirus cases. Logan is the only county in the state that has been rated code red as of Thursday. As such, its fall sports teams have been shut down – at least temporarily.
 Meanwhile, Mercer County added 11 new cases, according to the Thursday report from the Department of Health and Human Resources (DHHR).
 Fayette County reported five new cases and Raleigh County added four, pushing their respective totals to 183 and 314.

The panel was totally in love with Jimbo's transformation of Eka into Bimbo, but Stacey would have preferred to see the more refined and elegant version of them than the overly sexual one.

 He pointed out at the time that U.S. Attorney General William Barr had just announced the federal government intends to resume executions and will use pentobarbital rather than the three-drug cocktail that had previously been used.
 Arizona has not had an execution since 2014 because of its inability to get lethal drugs through legal means. Brnovich said that means the federal government had found a legal supply of the drug, meaning the state should be able to also get it hands on it.

LOUISVILLE, Ky. (WAVE) - The decision to prosecute police officers in the Breonna Taylor case could come down to a matter of following the bullets.More than 20 shots were fired into Taylor’s apartment by police, killing Taylor after she was hit multiple times.How those shots were fired raises legal questions.“If all three officers, in response to this bullet being fired by the boyfriend, sprayed bullets, they certainly could all be susceptible to criminal charges,” South Carolina law professor Colin Miller said. “If in my response I’m firing a gun and I’m spraying bullets in such that not just that person is hit but other people, I can’t claim self- defense.”Miller provided research on Kentucky law to attorneys representing Breonna Taylor’s family. He said state laws detailing murder and manslaughter could apply if it is shown that officers fired their weapons wildly without regard to innocent bystanders.Officers returned fire after Taylor’s boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, fired shots as police entered the apartment. One of those bullets hit officer Jon Mattingly in the leg as he entered the apartment.Walker said the couple did not hear police announce themselves before breaking down the door.Mattingly told LMPD internal investigators he fired four rounds.Many more bullet holes were visible from the outside of Breonna Taylor's apartment and some shots entered the neighboring apartment.The termination letter of Officer Brett Hankison however detailed a more severe response.The letter said Hankison acted with “extreme indifference to the value of human life when (he) wantonly and blindly fired 10 rounds into the apartment.”“If you read between the lines, that letter, that language they used, it seems pretty clear they are saying this officer is criminally and civilly responsible,” Miller said. Hankison has appealed his termination.The other two officers continue on administrative reassignment.Attorney General Daniel Cameron has not said when he intends to announce the results of his investigation.Copyright 2020 WAVE 3 News.
