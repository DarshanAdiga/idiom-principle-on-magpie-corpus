KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — Demonstrators who set up tents outside City Hall in Kansas City three weeks ago to demand police reform after an officer placed his knee on the back of a pregnant Black women have announced a temporary end to their encampment. The Kansas City Star reports that Black Rainbow, one of the groups that organized the occupation, announced on Instagram they’d declared a “ceasefire\" after beginning talks with public officials about divesting funds from law enforcement. Ryan Sorrel, a leader with Black Rainbow, said the demonstrators will return if they don't see the changes they want. The demonstration had demanded that city leaders fire the officer seen in a video kneeling on the pregnant woman, terminate Chief of Police Rick Smith and vow to divest 50% of the police force's budget. Sorrel said demonstrators began talking with city council members a few days ago about specific spaces where public safety funds and responsibilities, such as health crises and parking tickets, could be moved away from the police department. “We saw this as a very strategic move in order to not absolve all of our resources,” Sorrel said. Mayor Quinton Lucas said in a statement Saturday that he’s been meeting with such groups since May and planned to continue to do so in an effort to build trust. “While we will have our disagreements, all of us in Kansas City must work together to see better days ahead,” he said.

Bearcat football is undefeated so far this season and is on track to make a playoff run. With the help of the derailed pandemic-ridden season and guidance from key players like running back Gerrid Doaks and cornerback Coby Bryant, UC is destined further to climb the Associate Poll (AP) rankings.
 UC received an extended two-week bye after their first away matchup of the season against Tulsa was postponed to Dec. 5. Consequentially, Cincinnati was only demoted one rank to #9 overall in the latest AP Top-25 rankings.
 This one-rank demotion is extremely generous, considering the Bearcats haven't played in what will be three weeks on Saturday and have faced a relatively easy schedule thus far. A couple of things are playing out across college football to allow the Bearcats to maintain a top-10 spot.
 One is the respect for head coach Luke Fickell and his defensive coordinator Marcus Freeman, which is seen in analysts' rankings across the country.
 Complementing UC's coaching staff is the continuation of top-10 teams (North Carolina, Georgia, Florida and Miami) losing left and right. Maintaining an undefeated season is crucial for Cincinnati's playoff chances.
 Cincinnati's upcoming primetime contender, Southern Methodist University (SMU), will be one of the most critical matchups. A win against the 7-0 Mustang's will prove Cincinnati's legitimacy as they're currently the only ranked team on the Bearcat's remaining schedule.
 Offensively, Bearcat supporters can thank Doaks for powering them to an undefeated season thus far. Hopefully, during their three-week preparation for Tulsa, Doaks shared his tips on playing successful Bearcat football during a pandemic with his teammates.
 Despite being undefeated, there are vital pieces of the Bearcat's program falling behind. UC's offense has plenty of threats not being utilized, which Doaks has made up for. With six touchdowns through three games, he's been the savior of the lackluster UC offense.
 Cincinnati must prove why they're top-10 worthy, especially with the return of The Big Ten on Saturday. The buzz will soon fade from AAC teams and return to Big Ten teams like Ohio State (OSU), Penn State, Michigan, Minnesota and Michigan State.
 The Big Ten's return means a more challenging route for UC to the playoffs. College football analysts' focus will soon shift to determining where potential playoff contenders like OSU stand, potentially leaving most of UC's matchups against unranked teams Memphis and Houston to slide under the radar.
 Being in the AAC, with a stereotypically easy schedule, Cincinnati's playoff chances are slim from the start. A loss on the season guarantees them no chance of sliding into a playoff spot.
 Cincinnati needs top-10 teams to continue to lose while simultaneously blowing out all their unranked coemption.
 To do so starts with playmakers like quarterback Desmond Ridder and receivers Michael Young Jr. and Tre Tucker putting on a clinic against SMU.
 Both SMU and Cincinnati are undefeated, two of only nine remaining undefeated teams in college football. Both will be seeking a rare playoff spot and Saturday's late matchup will leave only one team with a real shot.

BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — Colombia reached 1 million confirmed coronavirus cases on Saturday, becoming the second country in Latin America to report that number in less than a week. The nation of 50 million saw cases peak in August and has seen a decline since but still continues to register around 8,000 new infections a day. Epidemiologists expect to see another marked increase by the end of the year, a prognosis that has put medical workers like nurse Freddy Harvey Rodríguez and his doctor son at one of Bogota’s largest hospitals on edge. “The fear is it’s going to be worse,” Rodríguez said on a recent afternoon. Argentina hit 1 million confirmed cases on Monday and Peru and Mexico are expected to reach the grim marker in the weeks ahead. Brazil ranks third worldwide in the number of virus cases and passed 1 million infections back in June. Overall, Latin America continues to register some of the highest caseloads, diagnosing more than 100,000 confirmed infections each day, though the World Health Organization reports that Europe is now seeing even larger numbers as a second virus wave strikes. Experts say the region is experiencing a table-top like effect in which cases remain relatively high instead of dramatically dropping. In a number of countries, the virus has begun spreading to areas that had previously registered relatively few cases. “The behavior of the virus is different,” said Dr. Luis Jorge Hernández, a public health professor at the University of the Andes in Colombia. “It’s not big resurgences but new outbreaks.” In Colombia, a six- month lockdown helped slow contagion and gave officials time to expand the number of ICU beds.

AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Texas has already cast nearly 7 million votes, more than anywhere in America, and Glen Murdoch couldn’t get his ballot in fast enough after becoming a U.S. citizen this summer. “I was champing at the bit,” said Murdoch, who moved to Austin from Australia shortly after President Donald Trump took office, and cast a ballot last week to vote him out. It’s a rush to the polls in Texas like seldom seen before. Ten days before Election Day, Texans have already cast as many early votes as they did in 2016 and are nearly 80% of the way toward hitting the total — both early and on Election Day — counted four years ago. The voting bonanza has some Democrats optimistic that decades of low turnout and undisputed Republican dominance may soon be a thing of the past. But what that it all means for Texas is far from clear. Voters don’t register by party in the state, making it difficult to know which party or presidential candidate has an edge. Polls are unusually close in Texas, but neither President Donald Trump or Democrat Joe Biden has swung through Texas, focusing on clear battleground states instead like Arizona and Florida. The striking numbers are across the board — in big cities that are solidly Democrat, in tipping-point suburbs where Republicans are losing ground and, to a lesser extent, in heavily Latino counties along the border. In Harris County, home to Houston, more than 1 million votes have already been cast. Democrats have long believed a breakthrough was only a matter of rousing millions of nonvoters, particularly within the state’s booming Latino population. Roughly 50% of voters currently registered to vote in Texas have never voted or vote infrequently, according to the voter information firm L2. A turnout surge could...

Pat Riley says LeBron and the Lakers beat Heat 'fair and squarely' but 'there will always be that asterisk' - CBSSports.com


--DocBreak--
If that is indeed how the options shake out, the Lakers would have eight players to deal. We will assume, for obvious reasons, that LeBron is not going to get traded. That leaves seven players to work with, but given his youth, contract and performance last season, we'll assume that the Lakers would prefer not to include Caruso either. The same argument could be made for Kuzma, but his fit isn't as clean and he is eligible for an extension now. Plus, the Lakers do need to give up value in this deal. Kuzma makes the most sense.
 That leaves us six players who make $32,651,363 combined ... less than $500,000 short of the salary necessary to land Paul. The Lakers could include Caruso to put themselves over the top, but prior to Friday, they had no reason to. They had a perfectly legal way of bridging that gap without him that also allowed them to keep Horton-Tucker in the process. Their last chip is the No. 28 overall pick. Using the 2019-20 rookie scale, that player could earn as much as $1,964,760 next season. Add that figure to the Lakers' pot and remove Horton-Tucker's and you get $33,098,142. That's $11,000 past the goal line, giving us a legal trade.
 This is where our problem comes in. First-round picks can be traded in one of two ways. If they are traded before the draft, as a pick, they have no attached salary. Technically, the Lakers couldn't trade this way anyway. They owe their 2021 first-round pick to the Pelicans and the Stepien Rule prevents teams from being without a first-round pick in consecutive seasons. They would have to take the second route: trading the pick after it has been made, when it is considered a player. Once the pick has signed his rookie contract, he is considered an NBA player with a salary number attached that counts in trades. This is how the 2014 Cleveland Cavaliers managed to trade for Kevin Love. They drafted Andrew Wiggins, signed him, and then traded him with his salary attached to hit that 80 percent figure. The issue here is that, according to the CBA, rookies cannot be traded until 30 days _after_ they sign their contract.
