In business, there are no small projects. There are only project managers who haven't embraced the full importance of crossing every 't' and dotting every 'i'. When major initiatives can ultimately dictate the success or failure of an entire business, it quickly becomes apparent which performers have the organizational talent and overall field vision to carry out big projects, and which ones just cross their fingers and hope for the best.

Celtic's exit means the path to the final has opened up and Ross wants his team to make up for the disappointment of losing their delayed Scottish Cup semi to local rivals Hearts last month.
 He said: "Celtic have dominated the cups over the last four years but there are still some good teams left in the competition even if they are out.
 "We've always said that these cup competitions offer us that realistic chance of achieving success.
 "We had the disappointment of going out of the Scottish Cup at the last four but progress in this tournament has been good to date so it's another opportunity for us to progress and try to win it.
 "When you get to semi-finals and fall short it is painful and does hurt. But we've got a group who want to keep putting themselves in the positions and give themselves the chance of going that step or two further forward."
 This will be the first time Ross has taken on Alloa since he quit as Wasps boss to move to St Mirren in 2016.

At the old O-Pee-Chee’s bubblegum and trading card factory in the Canadian city of London, Ontario, the month of December was most employees’ favorite time of the year.
 During most of the company’s history, that was when its eagerly anticipated packs of NHL player cards were manufactured — the crown jewel of its multi- sport product line.
 The process was largely manual. Once each player’s card was designed, films were used to print the image onto rectangular sheets of recycled cardboard large enough to fit 132 copies on each. From there, the sheets were fed by hand through two different industrial slicing machines in the basement of O-Pee-Chee’s old brick four-story factory, where sets of rotation knives sliced them first into rows, then into individual cutouts.
 After that, they were packaged with a stick of bubble gum, loaded up on a delivery truck, and sold across the continent to wide-eyed kids and hard-core collectors alike. In 1979, the year Wayne Gretzky’s rookie card was manufactured, an entire 16-case box cost only 20 cents.   On Thursday, a single copy of that very same Gretzky rookie card went to auction.
