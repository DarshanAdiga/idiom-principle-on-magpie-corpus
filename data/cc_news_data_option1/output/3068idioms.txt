In wake of Gov. Kate Brown sending the county back to the baseline of reopening, Umatilla County is moving forward with its plans to distribute at least $1.7 million from its allocation of the federal coronavirus relief package through small business grants.
 “If anything, there’s just even more of a demand and a need now,” said Gail Nelson, the county’s economic development and tourism coordinator.
 The move back to baseline on July 31 shuttered all “nonessential” businesses in the county once again, leaving mostly only grocery stores, pharmacies and banks open, and forcing restaurants and bars to revert to a takeout-only model.

 Landis was hired as MLB’s first commissioner in 1920. No Blacks played in the big leagues during his time in office that ended with his death in late 1944 — Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier in 1947 and Larry Doby followed later that season.
 Each AL and NL MVP trophy since Landis died has been stamped with his name, in letters double the size of the winner, and an imprint of his face. Landis let the BBWAA oversee the picking and presenting of MVPs in 1931.

PGA AWARDS
 A shorter PGA Tour season because of the pandemic has led the PGA of America to modify its two major awards for tour players.
 The Vardon Trophy, which dates to 1937 and is given to the PGA Tour player with the lowest adjust scoring average, required a play to complete at least 60 rounds. That number has been reduced to 44 this year because the tour went three months without playing due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Still in place are players becoming ineligible if they withdraw in the middle of a round.
 The PGA Player of the Year Award, first presented in 1948, is based on points for winning tournaments, position on the money list and scoring average. This year it will only have one major count toward the award because the U.S. Open and Masters are in the fall and the British Open was canceled. Majors count for 20 points. Regular PGA Tour events are worth 10 points.

A touch of good news among all the bad news was well worth it.
 “The guys lost a season that could have been a lucrative season for them,” said Lakes Region coach Adam Greenlese, on Sunday. “Being able to do this for them was huge. They were getting a bunch of bad news, one thing after the other. To have something to look forward to that’s normal, it’s huge.”
 The end of Greenlese’s remarks is poignant. Normalcy is something we all have craved in these last couple months. Players, coaches, family and media alike all needed that.
 Standing around Maxfield Sports Complex for the championship game on Sunday, you could tell how much this meant to the players and their families. The emotion was clear with every play made and loud exclaim when a critical turning point occurred.
 Family members and friends lined the outside of the fence to root them on.
 It felt normal again, even if the world around us is anything but that.
 As amazing as this past month of VSBL action was, hopefully it’s the one and only season we’ll need of the league.
 Hopefully, this time next year, kids had enjoyed a fruitful high school sports season and the American Legion season went on without a hitch.
 Nobody knows where we’ll be in the coming months, let alone a year from now.
 But if there’s one thing we can rely on, it’s hope.

By escaping the confines of his Boston hotel room, Josh Taylor has already made the first step toward rejoining the Red Sox bullpen.
 The left-hander tested positive for COVID-19 during the club's Summer Camp intake process and was immediately isolated. Taylor spent 14 days opening his door only to accept food delivery. His meals were left on the floor for Taylor to pick up and carry inside.
 Taylor, who was asymptomatic, had no contact with his teammates. He could not return to Fenway Park. And he remains on the road back at the club's alternate site, resuming his workouts at McCoy Stadium in Pawtucket.
 "You come in ready to go," Taylor said. "You're ready to throw right away. Having to take the two weeks off and trying to find a way to keep yourself ready - I was throwing into a sock in the hotel room."
 Taylor has thrown a pair of live batting practice sessions and is scheduled for one simulated inning on Tuesday. How hitters react to his mainly two-pitch arsenal - fastball and slider - will give Taylor a truer indication of where his stuff is at the moment.
 "Throwing bullpens you don't get the sights," Taylor said. "You don't get the hitter to read. I feel really good about how my stuff is coming out right now."
 The 27-year-old enjoyed a fine debut season with Boston in 2019. Taylor appeared in all but one of his 52 games out of the bullpen, pitching to a 3.04 earned-run average. He struck out 62 and allowed just 40 hits in 47 1/3 innings.
 "It comes down to what you've wanted your whole life," Taylor said. "You finally get your opportunity and you do the best you can with it. Now you're not looked at as, 'Let's get him up here, let's get him innings and let's move on.'
 "I feel like what I did last year, I went out and I earned a spot. It feels good to know they rely on me. It fuels you and it's confidence-building in you."
 Acquiring Taylor from the Diamondbacks was a nice piece of business executed by former Red Sox president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski. Boston sent infielder Deven Marrero to Arizona in May 2018, and there was no obvious place for him in the Red Sox lineup at the time. Rafael Devers, Xander Bogaerts, Eduardo Nunez and Brock Holt were all preferred options.
 Taylor was recalled twice by Boston in 2019, with the second time coming on June 14. He remained with the club for the rest of the campaign, establishing himself as a go-to option alongside fellow rookie Darwinzon Hernandez.
 "I told a lot of people when I got called up the first time I was pitching with my back against the wall," Taylor said. "I was pitching not to get sent down instead of pitching to earn a spot. When I got sent down it kind of put me in that place.
 "When I got called right back up it kind of put my mindset as, 'They want me here. I earned this opportunity and I'm going to run with it.'"
 The Red Sox have staggered to a 3-7 start, including a 9-7 loss to the Yankees on Sunday night. Boston squandered a pair of two-run leads and a couple one- run leads while being swept in the Bronx. Taylor is itching for his next chance to help the Red Sox avoid sinking any deeper in what is just a 60-game season.
 "I'm watching every game and cheering for the team," Taylor said. "It's just tough seeing something go on and sit back saying, 'I wish I could go help. I wish there was something I could do.'
 "I know my time is going to come, and hopefully sooner rather than later I'll be up there to help the team."

_Dead Cells_ is an action-platformer from indie studio Motion Twin. It originally launched two years ago in August 2018, introducing quite the unique roguelike experience. If the threat of permadeath doesn’t keep players on edge, the punishing combat and challenging enemies most certainly will. _Dead Cells_ ‘ commercial success warrants praise in its own right as well. Since release, the roguelike has moved an impressive three million units worldwide.
  _GreedFall_ hit stores last year, filling the void for a solid narrative- driven RPG. The title sees players exploring uncharted land, finding riches, magic, and other forms of treasure. Aiding in the development of _GreedFall’s_ remote island is also key to the experience. In turn, forging alliances for the sake of diplomacy plays a central role in the overarching narrative. The Spiders-developed project represented nothing short of a boon for publisher Focus Home Interactive, too.
 All in all, this appears to be a great month to jump into PS Now for those who either haven’t given it a go or backed out in recent months. Thanks to last fall’s price drop, the service only costs $9.99 per month.

Barre’s Cameron Ouellette and Craftsbury’s Martin are just 10 and 18 points behind, respectively. Derrick Calkins, Lanphear, Powers, and Perry are also very much in contention for the overall title.
 Thursday’s slate also includes full championship action for the Maplewood/Irving Oil Late Models and Allen Lumber Street Stocks.
 For the third straight year, the Late Model battle for “King of the Road” looks like it will go down to the wire. Wolcott’s Marcel J. Gravel remains atop the standings with a 16-point edge over defending “King of the Road” Jason Corliss of Barre.
 Shelburne’s Trampas Demers and Milton’s Scott Dragon, two familiar players in recent championship fights, are right on Corliss’s tail. Teammates Christopher Pelkey and Bobby Therrien are tied for fifth and have been consistently fast all year long.
 In the Allen Lumber Street Stocks, the championship remains the Brandon Gray show. The East Thetford veteran has nearly a full event’s worth of points over two-time champion Jamie Davis of Wolcott in the runner-up spot.
 Gray is the only Street Stock driver to finish in the top-10 of every feature.
 Only 36 points separate second-place Davis from ninth-place Luke Peters, meaning a lot can change should the opportunity present itself.
 There is also a fantastic battle for Rookie of the Year between Kaiden Fisher, Peters and Kyler Davis with two of the three having found Victory Lane this year.

Myron tried playing the clarinet. Everybody did. He moved to a tuba. Tote that barge, lift that bale. He checked it off and went to the drums. He wasn’t good, but he was loud. He was drummed out of the junior high school band. That left him with the big decision as to what his life’s path would be. He knew the future was important because his favorite baseball player, Dan Quisenberry, said, “I have seen the future, and it is much like the present, only longer.” Over the years, he narrowed it down to becoming either an underwater welder or a bagpipe player (piper). He decided to become a piper. His parents entertained doubts, but were supportive and consented. His father called it one of those “What was I thinking?” moments. The neighbors claimed it was just bad parenting. “I don’t mind the boy owning bagpipes. What I mind is him playing them,” said one.

He suggested his frustration was spurred by his administration not receiving proper credit for testing so many people or for pushing to replenish the stockpile of ventilators early in the crisis. On Tuesday, he boasted that the U.S. has increased testing capacity by 32,000% since March 12 and has “far and away the most testing capacity in the world.” Trump in early March declared “anybody that needs a test gets a test." Yet, in many parts of the country, it can still take a week or longer for patients to receive test results.

Winfrey has been a literary tastemaker for decades, in part because of her commitment to a given book. She read “Caste” a few months ago, before bound, printed copies were available. Struggling with the digital edition Random House sent her, she asked for a physical version, however possible, and received from the publisher loose pages that she stapled together and placed in a three-ring binder. She then bought 500 copies, which she plans to send to leaders in business, sports and politics, including all 50 state governors.

“My third major, the Masters, I was already one of the favorites to win because I played good golf,” Rahm said. “So I never really had that adjustment period, and maybe I didn’t manage it as best I could have.”
 He played his first major at Oakmont for the U.S. Open in 2016, right after he graduated from Arizona State. He was low amateur, and that made him feel like he could contend.
 “I didn’t play my best golf, top 25, so I was like, ‘Well, if I play good I’m going to be able to win,’” he said Tuesday. “You get a reality check that major championship golf is not just playing good. It’s more a mental test than anything else. I’ve been having some good showings and somewhat close calls, but I’m ready to have a better chance on a Sunday.”
 Hideki Matsuyama, who was 25 when he reached No. 2 in the world, noticed his expectations of winning started early. He made the cut twice at the Masters as an amateur. At age 21, he tied for sixth at Muirfield in the British Open. His best chance was at the 2017 PGA Championship, when he was one-shot behind with three holes to play and finished three shots behind Justin Thomas.

Tapp had to relearn how to walk -- and even how to swallow -- with some "very intense" and tiring speech, physical and occupational therapy, she said.
 "It was something that I just had to conquer," Tapp said.
 "I was willing and able to fight it and make sure that I came out, and that I was able to walk," she said.
 She's gone from a wheeled walker to walking with a cane, and still has therapy three times a week.
 "So, I still have a long way to go," she said.

Soccer players learned how to play the game the right way from Peter Kasarjian.
 Competing with intensity, but always with integrity. Kasarjian always preached and exemplified in his many years as a high school soccer coach in Plymouth.
 "That's what I think about when I think of Peter - integrity," said his friend of nearly 50 years, Dennis Azevedo. "He played and coached with a will to win, but he would never compromise his principles to get there. Peter always did things the right way to be successful and it's really been my honor to be his friend for all these years."
 Kasarjian was a three-season athlete at both Plymouth-Carver as well as Springfield College but it is his work on the soccer field for which he is most well known. He is a two-time inductee into the Plymouth Athletic Hall of Fame, both as a player and as a coach.
 "I actually came to Plymouth a little bit late," Kasarjian said. "I lived in Medford until the eighth grade, and that's when my family moved down here. My father owned a restaurant in Manomet, the Lord Alden, and I've been here in Plymouth ever since."
 A four-year soccer and baseball player at P-C, Kasarjian also dabbled in basketball and hockey during his time as a Blue Eagle. "I got recruited by a friend of mine to be the goalie on the hockey team. We had a pretty good team. We won the Cranberry League championship my junior year."
 While playing high school sports, Kasarjian's parents were working an often unavailable to get him home after practice. Fortunately he had a back-up plan.
 "I can't tell you how many times I got a ride home from (former physical education teacher and athletic director) Henry Cryer after practice. He had a huge influence on me," Kasarjian said. "He's the reason why I decided I wanted to be a physical education teacher. I wanted the chance to help people like he had helped me."
 After playing forward on the soccer team in high school, Kasarjian shifted to the back line in college.
 "I didn't play a lot, but I learned that you could learn a lot just by watching," he said. "I got my chance to start as a senior and I think we were a Top 20 program that year."
 Kasarjian continued to stay busy at Springfield College with three years on the club hockey squad and two seasons as goalie on the varsity lacrosse team.
 "I think I was able to handle everything better in-season," Kasarjian said about playing three sports in college. "It gave me a timeframe to get things done."
 It was also at Springfield that Kasarjian and Azevedo formed a 50-year friendship that continues to this day.
 "Peter introduced me to my wife, Diane," Azevedo said. "They graduated from Plymouth-Carver together."
 Kasarjian was back teaching and coaching soccer in Plymouth as soon as he graduated from Springfield. He was a sub-varsity coach for two seasons before elevating to the varsity spot for two years. He was named head coach of the men's soccer program at Massasoit Community College in 1979 and moved to Mass. Maritime Academy in 1981. He led Massasoit to a New England title, and at one point in that championship season his team was ranked fifth in the nation.
 After the 1985 season, Kasarjian stepped down from his head coaching duties as his twin children, Brian and Kate, grew older.
 "I'd spent so much with other people's children and I wanted to make sure that I spent all the time I could with my own," Kasarjian explained. "My wife, Debbie, was a teacher in the Plymouth school system as well, and she was the biggest supporter of me in all my coaching endeavors. I couldn't have done it without her."
 While he did lighten his coaching load, he never could quite step away from coaching soccer. Kasarjian has been an assistant with several local high school programs and was even on the sideline helping out Plymouth North girls soccer head coach Eric Foley as late as last year.
 Kasarjian is also part of the group that started the popular Championship Soccer School that helps hundreds of players each year get ready for the fall soccer season.
 "I'm really appreciative of coaches like Emerson Coleman, Dennis and Eric for letting me work on their staff over the years. I still love teaching the game," Kasarjian said.
 Azevedo said having an experienced hand such as Kasarjian on staff was always a blessing.
 "One thing I've learned from Peter is to coach the entire team, not just the top players," Azevedo said. "That's one thing I've always admired about Peter as a coach. He can connect with everyone on the roster and make them all feel like they are part of the process. Not all coaches are able to make all their players feel like they have value."
 Kasarjian broke down his coaching philosophy into three key elements.
 "I asked my players to be respectful, responsible and thankful," said Kasarjian, who was also a housemaster at Plymouth South Middle School at the end of his career in education. "I wanted them to be competitive, but always thankful for the opportunity to represent their team. It's not a chance that everyone got."

MADISON, Wis. (AP) — Rapper Kanye West has filed signatures in Wisconsin to run for president as an independent candidate in November. The Wisconsin Elections Commission said signatures were submitted on behalf of West on Tuesday, which was the last day for independent presidential candidates to submit the required 2,000 signatures of Wisconsin voters to get on the ballot. West and running mate Michelle Tidball listed themselves as candidates of the BDY, The Birthday Party. The commission staff will be reviewing the petitions in coming days to determine if there are enough valid signatures and if the candidates meet all qualifications to get on the ballot. Republican Donald Trump narrowly won Wisconsin in 2016.

The space the coffeehouse inhabits has been two years in the making. About six layers were taken off the walls — revealing exposed brick, and about seven layers were taken off of the wood floors. An elevated front seating area has sheet music and postcards from Gau’s grandmother decoupaged on the floor, tables lining the shop were made by her father out of church pews, the swallow logo designed by Gau can be found throughout the establishment, and two classic bicycles hang from the ceiling. To top it off, lights from the former North Prairie Lutheran Church hang over the coffee bar — pieces that mean a lot to Gau as well as other locals.
