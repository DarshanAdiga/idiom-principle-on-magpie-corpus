Deputy Chief Minister and Higher Education Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan has directed senior officials of the department to immediately submit a proposal with regard to the appointment of 350 lecturers at aided degree colleges. This issue has been on the back burner even after getting approval from the Finance Department.
 The Finance Department had approved the appointment of 907 lecturers at aided colleges. Of these, the appointment orders for 369 posts were issued and these lecturers are already working in the colleges. This process has been completed as per the UGC norms, according to a release from the office of the Minister. “As many as 350 applications are in the verification stage. Action with regard to their appointment will be taken after the completion of discussions at the higher level,” said the Minister.
 P.C. Jaffer, Secretary, Department of Finance, who was present at the meeting, promised that action would be taken as soon as the proposal is received. The lectures of aided colleges, led by Kollegala MLA Mahesh, expressed their grievances.

Dundalk goalkeeper Gary Rogers is set to announce his retirement from professional football after a 20-year career. The 39-year-old has opted to hang up his gloves with Thursday night's Europa League defeat to Arsenal bringing down the curtain on a journey which started with St Francis back in 2000.He had mulled over the decision in recent weeks but confirmed his intentions in the aftermath of the Arsenal match - even though Dundalk were keen on Rogers sticking around.Last Sunday's FAI Cup Final victory over Shamrock Rovers allowed the veteran to go out on a high.The Meathman won five Premier Division titles (four with Dundalk, one with Sligo) and five FAI Cups (three Dundalk, one with Sligo Rovers and one with Drogheda) and also steps away with the record for League of Ireland appearances in Europe (54).Rogers is second in the all-time League of Ireland appearance list and had ambitions of catching Al Finucane at the top of the charts but Covid-19 put an end to that.He started his career at Shelbourne and his St Francis debut came while on loan. Stints at Drogheda, Dublin City, Bray, St Patrick's Athletic and Sligo Rovers followed before Stephen Kenny brought him to Dundalk for the 2015 season.Rogers was called into the senior Ireland squad a year later and was on the bench for a World Cup qualifier with Serbia.He was active with the players union, PFA Ireland, serving as chairman until recently and the talented GAA performer has also worked as a goalkeeping coach with a variety of intercounty sides in tandem with his professional football career. It wouldn't be a surprise if his next sporting move came in the GAA field.

MARYVILLE, Mo. — As a way of supporting Under the Son Ministries, four local families opened their homes to the public on Sunday, offering a peek into their living spaces, Christmas traditions and holiday décor.
 Pleased with the turnout, tour organizers Steve and Donella Sherry told The Forum Wednesday that 146 people briefly popped into the lives of homeowners: JR and Sarah Kurz; Paul and Cindy Kessler; Josh and Kim Lefeber; and Jacob Vollstedt and Victoria Hollar as part of the organization’s fourth annual Christmas Homes Tour.
 Some tourists took part in the event alone taking their time traversing the old and new homes, getting a peek at every nook and cranny, while others paired with family and friends to see the holiday décor glimmer and shine in every home.

I know it's convention to use the official IPO price--which in Airbnb's case was $68--as the reference point, but that obscures what really happened with the "hot, hot" IPOs this week. DoorDash the day before was a similar story. Priced at $102, closed around $189--for an 85% "day one" gain _if_ you got the shares before they actually hit the market. In reality, the shares only rose 3.8% from the $182 price where they actually opened.

The back staircase leads to the main floor and to a powder room, the back of the house and past a door to the basement which had once housed a coal furnace, sizable cellar and the kitchen at one point.
 Following a hallway around to an updated kitchen, tour takers were treated with views of holiday cheer and by way of a butler’s pantry, the dining room featuring rounded windows and original woodwork and a large nearly floor-to- ceiling Christmas tree. Large pocket doors closed off the room from the hall and parlor, where a white sofa, also original, sits.
 Classically decorated with wreaths and garland, the outside of the home is where Paul Kessler and son Billy were spending the warm afternoon.
 “It’s got a lot of character,” he said. “The woodworking on the first floor, I can’t imagine somebody doing that all by hand 120 years ago.”
 Just into the family’s second year owning the home, Paul told The Forum it was exactly what they had been looking for when moving to town. Cindy said they took last year’s tour and were pleased to be able to open their doors to the tour.
 Steve Sherry with Under the Son Ministries was on hand at the Kesslers’ and said it was great the family was willing to join the tour.
 “People were always wanting to get a peek at this one,” Sherry said.
 One of the newer homes on the tour, the Kurz home, located at 25464 Sycamore Lane, was hopping with people getting a look at JR and Sarah’s decorations.
 On a tour led by their daughter Reagan Kurz, holiday tour takers were treated to a look at her room and special Christmas tree on which hangs special ornaments. Every ornament, one for each year of her life, is about activities or things in which she’s shown great interest. Last year’s ornament was a Patrick Mahomes jersey, a version of which she also wore during the tour.
 Reagan continued the tour by showing off the upstairs den and even her sisters’ Carsyn and Payton’s room and their ornamental trees.
 In the living room, tourists looked for items on the tour’s annual scavenger hunt in a nearly 10-foot tall Christmas tree full of white flowers and “snow- flecked” pinecones and branches. Sarah told The Forum she tried to find and use winter décor more than Christmas-related items, because it can stay out for a longer time during the winter season.
 “Otherwise January and February gets pretty bleak,” she said.
 While on the tour, masks were required and booties were given to each attendee to help with the pandemic, but also keep homes on the tour as clean as possible.
 Proceeds from the tour will be used for educational expenses of children at Gethsemane Home in Chiang Mai, Thailand, a cause near and dear to the Sherrys’ hearts.
 Steve and Donella have traveled to Thailand off and on for nearly 10 years now with the ministry and work with local Christians there to spread the word and help students.
 The couple also plans to hold Wonderfully Made & Mertal’s Folkart Krafts Christmas Popup Shop from 1 to 6 p.m. Thursday, Dec. 10 at 1103 W. 18th St. The shop will offer Christmas décor and items from Thailand, including stocking stuffers, ornaments and more.

 The strike severely inconvenienced the public as majority of the travelling public largely depend on public transport for their commuting needs. The clueless passengers were seen proceeding towards the railway station looking for transportation needs.
 In the morning, there was heavy rush of passengers on buses that operated in limited numbers when some staff reported for duty.
 The intra-city operations were by and large normal since morning and nearly 70 per cent of trips were operated. However, when three to four buses were stoned, the services were suspended in the evening.
 Officials said not all the employees are taking part in the strike. However, following the incidents of stone throwing, the staff are resisting from operating the buses.
 They said all stranded passengers at the city bus-stand would be cleared by night, employing the on-duty staff and some buses had been stationed at the bus-stand instead of sending them back to the depots to clear the rush.
 Some buses suffered minor damages in the stone throwing incidents reported in the city limits and three away from the city limits, a KSRTC Mysuru urban division officer said.

But let's not pretend Joe Public was benefitting from this version of an IPO "pop," which happened entirely _before_ the shares hit the market. Just look at the difference between how Airbnb and DoorDash traded this week versus another hot IPO from last summer: Beyond Meat. Beyond Meat priced at $25, opened at $46--and surged as high as $73 during the first trading session. _That_ 59% pop was at least publicly available (the shares closed around $65).


--DocBreak--
So in fact, the broader public didn't so much fuel the spectacular IPOs this week--unless they could get their hands on the shares early--as shrug them off. Which makes sense; by the time DoorDash _really_ went public, at $182, it was a $60 billion company with no profits. Airbnb shares at $146 when they finally hit the market made it a $100 billion company; larger than Marriott, Hilton, and Hyatt combined.

Myxed Up was later allowed to conduct curbside pick up, but the initial shutdown from the city felt like poor messaging to Guernin, who was frustrated by the conflicting messages from government officials during the early stages of the pandemic; he points to statements from National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Anthony Fauci in March discouraging Americans from wearing face masks. On April 3, the Centers for Disease Control recommended face coverings, but Governor Jared Polis didn't issue a state-wide mask order until July.
 "We've gotten no guidance, and the guidance we've gotten has been horrible -- and then they want it to look like we don't trust them," Guernin argues. "You're taking your last resources just trying to hang onto your business, and then you find out you can't do that anymore."
 Myxed Up Creations received a Payment Protection Program loan, which Guernin is grateful for. But he worries how other small businesses will weather the storm as the pandemic continues.

Deputy Chief Minister and Higher Education Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan has directed senior officials of the department to immediately submit a proposal with regard to the appointment of 350 lecturers at aided degree colleges. This issue has been on the back burner even after getting approval from the Finance Department.
 The Finance Department had approved the appointment of 907 lecturers at aided colleges. Of these, the appointment orders for 369 posts were issued and these lecturers are already working in the colleges. This process has been completed as per the UGC norms, according to a release from the office of the Minister. “As many as 350 applications are in the verification stage. Action with regard to their appointment will be taken after the completion of discussions at the higher level,” said the Minister.
 P.C. Jaffer, Secretary, Department of Finance, who was present at the meeting, promised that action would be taken as soon as the proposal is received. The lectures of aided colleges, led by Kollegala MLA Mahesh, expressed their grievances.
