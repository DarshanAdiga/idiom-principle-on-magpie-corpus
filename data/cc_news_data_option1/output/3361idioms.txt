The internal committee of TS Power Generation Corporation (TS-Genco), which has been tasked to inquire the 6×150 MW Srisailam Left Bank Hydro Electric Station fire accident, has assessed that the damage to the power plant was huge and that four units were in a position of revival in two to 10 weeks’ time.
 The team that had visited the underground power station near Eegalapenta in Nagarkurnool district for preliminary estimation of the damage has returned to the city and held a review meeting on detailed assessment, including the causes for the mishap.
 A highly-placed executive in the power utility told _The Hindu_ that revival of units one, two, three and five could be taken up soon. The team would again leave for the hydel station on Wednesday.
 Sources stated that restoration of power supply for lighting purpose in the tunnel power station was done partially already and it could be completed soon. However, installation of the essential air-exhaust and pumping fresh air systems would take time and de-watering of the pool of seepage water from the plant is expected to be completed on Wednesday.
 “We have already come to an assessment that fourth unit is damaged to a maximum extent and the sixth unit too found to be damaged considerably in the fire. However, units one, two, three and five could be revived over the next 10 to 12 weeks starting with units one and two. We hope to revive the two units and resume generation over the next couple of weeks so that the flood season is made use of for generation of the low-cost energy and units three and five over the next couple of months,”, the official explained.
 Along with revival of the units, the generation utility has decided to focus on the upgraded safety mechanisms in the underground hydel project since the existing facilities did not help prevent the mishap or minimise the fire/damage. The official sources stated that the components which are not damaged could be tested for their functionality only after the restoration of power supply in the power station.
 Chairman and Managing Director of TS-Genco D. Prabhakar Rao is scheduled to visit the Srisailam LBHES on Wednesday to take stock of the efforts to assess the damage completely and restore basic facilities in the underground power station.

“I haven’t seen them in a long time,” Mickelson said. “Grew up playing with them for a number of years, and it’s exciting for me to come out here and see so many people I know. On the regular tour, I don’t know a lot of the guys now.”
 Mickelson has had a roller-coaster season so far, finishing second at the WGC- FedEx St. Jude Invitational and third at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am back in March. He also made the cut at the recent PGA Championship at Harding Park in San Francisco, though he faded well off the pace over the weekend. But he also has missed six cuts, including this week at The Northern Trust, leaving him with both optimism in his game but clearly defined areas that need work.
 “I love playing and competing, and heading into the U.S. Open, I’ll play the week before in Napa, but I didn’t want to have two weeks off when I’ve been working hard on my game,” he said. “I was really wanting to play and compete in the playoffs, so it was a disappointing first round and it’s fun for me to have a chance to come play.”
 Fun for tournament organizers, too. There is a sudden buzz that was lacking just days ago, when the PGA Tour Champions played at neighboring Buffalo Ridge Golf Course in an event won by Shane Bertsch in a four-man playoff.
 “Phil’s had an amazing career and still plays at a very high level. It’s great to have him out here,” two-time Masters champion Bernhard Langer said. “I’m sure any tournament or any sponsor will be happy to see Phil. It’s great the guys who have come out lately with Ernie Els, Retief Goosen, Mike Weir and on and on.”
 Mickelson would love to win this week. He never goes into a tournament expecting anything less. But he also wants to make sure his game is in shape for Winged Foot, where he will try again to complete the career grand slam. He’s been the runner-up a maddening six times, including the 2006 event on the same course just north of New York City.
 “Well, it will be fun and exciting to compete at Winged Foot,” Mickelson said. “It’s been 14 years since I’ve been back there, so I’m looking forward to getting back and playing a golf course that I was so close to accomplishing a dream.”

Now she teaches the first half of the ballroom dance class with dancers just working on their own, and in the second half dancers can work with partners or stay by themselves, depending on what they are comfortable with.
 Most people are comfortable enough to work with a partner now, but some still prefer to dance individually and some have chosen to still remain home, Head said.
 Sergiu Brindusa is the co-owner and co-artistic director of Alliance Academy of Dance at 200 E. Pine St. in Pocatello. He also teaches ballet.
 Alliance Academy of Dance is conducting classes as usual but has enforced drastic social distancing rules outside of class in addition to disinfecting more, Brindusa said.
 “We don't allow the families and parents to come in anymore to the building. … We have a couple lounge areas where they were congregating before and waiting for their kids or watching through the windows … but none of that's happening right now,” Brindusa said. “We simply just cut (down) on foot traffic. … There is a one-way traffic through the studio. So basically, if you come in, you come out the other side. That's it; you don't come back in. So you're here only for that limited period of time, no lingering. And we have sealed off some congregating areas.”
 He continued, “We have done absolutely everything that we can humanly do to control the flow and the traffic, control the closeness as much as possible. But, as you know, with any form of physical activity, closeness is one of those things that you have to have. I mean, it's like how do you play basketball without closeness? I would like to see if a person can come up with that. I don't think so.”
 Social distancing changed the way Alliance Academy will hold performances, Brindusa said.
 “The biggest and the saddest thing is that the theaters are closed. So we weren't able to perform our spring production of ‘Swan Lake,’ which is a major production, a full-length ballet, with sets and scenery and the whole shebang,” Brindusa said. “We were not able to go to those conventions and competitions where we are always recognized as a very talented and reputable studio. So it was sad for them, you know? It was sad for the kids. It was sad for their families.”
 He continued, “We had this logistical nightmare unfolding in front of (us) because some things we paid for, some things we were paying for and so on and so forth. … If you reserve all the sets and scenery from a company to put on your production, you have to call them and you have to tell them, ‘Look, I'm sorry, but we're gonna have to put this on hold.’”
 Alliance Academy of Dance reserved time at the Portneuf Health Trust Amphitheatre, an outdoor venue, to hold performances on Aug. 7 and 8, which allowed for social distancing.
 “We're very grateful that we were able to do that. We've taken everything we couldn't do this year, and we've kind of put it all together in the recital performance and in the concept performance,” Bridusa said. “It's an open air amphitheater. So people can stay separated and it’s outside and it’s in the evening. … We are able to do abbreviated pieces from ‘Swan Lake,’ and the competitive groups are dancing their pieces and their solos and their variations in ballet. So (it was) a very, very nice experience nonetheless.”
 Alliance Academy of Dance will still have to see what happens with the annual “Nutcracker” performance, but Brindusa said that dancers are resilient and the future is hopeful.
 “I'm very confident that people are going to get through this, and I think that there will be better days ahead,” Brindusa said. “I think that right now it’s uncertain, but things will come back to normal. They have to, they just have to, and people should just have a little courage and make good decisions.”

The AIA definition noted last month could be re-engineered to a PC definition that continued with, “financial responsibility, energy, and the environment; day-to-day space and occupant comfort, design intent, and operation.”
 A PC company already experienced in taking on the risk of past projects could extend itself by going “the final yard” to complete success by having the project certified. For those knowledgeable about sales and getting out in front, this PDM-first would be ahead of the curve and leave the competition in the dust. This PC company of choice would have a lot of ground to make up before they would be ready to certify, as their PC projects were not only guaranteed for the financial performance but also for the project’s energy performance goals, the environment results, occupant comfort, and continuous building system design intent.
 Deciding on the optimum PDM is essential, but only PC offers the potential to be the complete PDM.

Neither of our friends is dissuaded from seeking the best that is available in their lives. Nor should they be. Their distinct, but not unique, characteristics can be acknowledged and, if necessary, accommodated. (Fergus is given a small sedative in the evenings before July 4th.) None in the canine world care about their disabilities or handicaps.
 Our children, grandchildren, relatives, neighbors, friends, co-workers, fellow citizens have similar distinct, but not unique, characteristics. Some were born with these characteristics, others acquired them from their earliest influences, still others acquired or recognized them as they aged and interacted with a discriminating world.
 To discern differences is natural and necessary. How we respond to those differences is critically important. Some we take for granted and ignore if we perceive no functional value for them in our society. A mole on the lip (as I have) is not a significant disfigurement, although it has probably prevented my appearance on the covers of several influential magazines.

Another PC concept I have had in my head for years comes from my 50-plus years’ experience working in the design; construction; and service, operation, and maintenance arenas. Why not design-build-operate-maintain and certify the building project? There are PDMs that include building certification (e.g., LEED) based on budgeted performance but fall short of guaranteeing performance will be met.
 Here is where a PC firm could differentiate itself from all the competition by guaranteeing the PDM results because the missing link in each of the other four PDMs is operating and maintaining obligations. The building owner/client will select and sign a contract scope of work that includes design-build- operate-maintain-certified with a PC, ensuring annual building program and design intent compliance.
 The concept will require researching how to be a complete PC firm using analytical quality control, problem-solving methods made popular back in the 1920s by Walter A. Shewhart and further developed in Japan in the late 1940s and 1950s.

The stars of the long-running comedy _Home Improvement_ are reuniting for a new competition series that will appear on History.
 History has ordered 10 episodes of _Assembly Required_ (working title). Allen and Karn will both executive produce. Allen will star and Karn will serve as host.
 The show is expected to premiere in 2021.
 The show will also be assembled with the network, producers and brand sponsors working together.
 The series is being produced by Wheelhouse Entertainment’s Spoke Studios, ITV America and Boxing Cat Entertainment. Wheelhouse’s marketing arm, Wheelhouse Labs, production will work closely with History’s advertising sales team in a joint effort to invite and secure brands that want to ally with the new Allen- starring series.
 The show will spotlight top builders from around their country, at their home workshops, as they compete to repair everyday household items.
 "Our history is defined by the innovations of ordinary dreamers creating extraordinary things, from Thomas Edison’s light bulb to the Wright brothers’ first flight," said Eli Lehrer, executive VP and general manager for History. "We look forward to partnering with Tim and Richard, America’s beloved duo, as they challenge a new wave of skilled individuals to think out-of-the-box to build upon the innovations of those before them. We hope this series will inspire viewers to think twice about throwing out that old item, roll up their sleeves and rebuild it better."
 Allen and Karn will also talk about the unique history of the items being repaired during the program.
 "Let’s face it -- we’re living in a throwaway society," said Tim Allen. "We buy, break, replace… rinse and repeat. Whatever happened to repair and rebuild? There are some people who unfriend, unfollow and dispose of anything that offends, annoys or breaks - so I’ve created a show to remind people of the satisfaction and pride that comes from rebuilding something on their own. And who better to join me than my buddy from the old _Tool Time_ days - Richard Karn! Now we’re talking More Power!

I first met Joe at the Greeley Stampede grounds on a chilly fall morning in 2012 as he was campaigning for his boss’ re-election. Reviewing notes from that day, when he arrived clutching a steaming Starbucks with gloved hands, I discovered a remark he could recycle tomorrow, “Republicans have a fundamentally different view of this country than the president and myself. I don’t recognize the America they’re talking about — they see problems rather than promise; they see an America in decline.”
 Four years later, I met the veep again at the Community College of Denver’s vocational skills campus during a national tour promoting Obama’s proposal for tuition-free Associate Degrees. There were no more than a dozen in attendance and Biden took time to speak with each of us. Eventually he huddled behind a young man who was remotely operating a pipe lathe from a computer console. Squeezing the student’s shoulders, he asked what he was trying to do? It wasn’t many more months before the “Me Too” movement exploded, and complaints emerged noting the vice president’s penchant for physical, hands-on touching that left several women genuinely uncomfortable. He apologized.
 Only Tara Reade alleged an assault. During the ‘90s, when this reportedly occurred in a basement hallway at the U. S. Capitol, I was traveling regularly to Washington. These subterranean corridors that connect office buildings in the Congressional complex are always crowded with scurrying aides, lobbyists and tourists. What Reade alleges transpired would have been impossible to hide from view. She merely had to shout out for help and these pedestrians would have quickly responded. Politico reports Reade has left a trail of “…aggrieved acquaintances who remember that she always spoke favorably of her time working for Biden.”
 In my experience, men who cannot leave young women alone are much like drug addicts — they can’t stop themselves, whatever the risks. A single, uncorroborated complaint is just that, especially an accusation from a woman whose personal history evidences a shaky relationship with the truth. I choose to remain a skeptic. In a thoroughly despicable move, the president with more than 20 credible charges of sexual harassment, is believed to have invited Ms. Reade to address the Republican Convention.
 Richard Ben Cramer’s thousand-page accounting of the 1988 presidential primary, “What It Takes”, reported that, “Biden (was) speech driven … but that was just guru talk for the fact that Joe didn’t know what he thought until he had to say it.” Last week this garrulousness had vanished. In a well-crafted acceptance speech to 2020 Democrats, Biden made it crystal clear that he and Kamala Harris intend to place the twin engines of American economic and social progress back on the tracks leading to a stable and prosperous future. I’m ready for that.

Great, but also — yawn. iRobot has been teasing this stuff since it introduced mapping in 2018. Plus, you expect flashy features on high-end products to justify the bonkers cost. More interesting is the tech that’s trickling down to the cheaper bots. With iRobot’s update, cheaper wifi-enabled robot cleaners will gain event automations via IFTTT and favourite routines. The former means that if you have other smart gadgets, you can get them “talking” to each other. So, if my cat’s litter robot finishes a cycle, it might then trigger the Roomba to begin cleaning. So maybe, just maybe, I might one day live in a home that is free of random litter. More reasonably, if you have a smart lock, your Roomba will know to start cleaning when you leave and to stop when you arrive home. As for favourite routines, you can create pre- set routines like “after dinner” or “bedtime” to clean during specific times. iRobot is also including seasonal recommendations, so you may get tips to schedule more frequent cleaning during allergy or pet shedding seasons.


  It might not seem like much, but these new scheduling options are nifty. Cheaper robot vacuums used to not only lack wifi, but scheduling had to be done via shitty remotes that didn’t work half the time. That improved with wifi, but just a few years ago, you needed to fork over at least $US800 ($1,116) for a wifi-connected bot. Now wifi connectivity can be found on budget robot cleaners under $US300 ($418). However, a lot of the app functionality on cheaper bots was limited to manually setting up schedules. Easy enough right? Not always. If you had a variable routine and forgot to manually change the schedule, you could end up with a disaster. I once brought a wily Roomba to my office. Because I forgot to turn off its night-time cleaning schedule, it ended up wandering to the office next door, where my work neighbours summarily tried to kidnap it. A custody battle ensued. Something like the event automation with a smart lock might help to prevent that, or at least provide more intuitive scheduling options.


  Still, iRobot’s update won’t change the fact that its most “affordable” robot vacuums are navigational disasters that ping-pong across your room with no rhyme or reason, occasionally destroying furniture by banging into it and likely missing the mess you wanted it to clean in the first place. (I once tested a Roomba 600 series that bowled over a dining chair in the pursuit of a dust bunny. It was the same one that got robo-napped.) This isn’t exactly worth it if connected features are limited to a paper-thin app — even if the robot vacuum is dirt-cheap. That said, I abhor vacuuming with the blazing fire of a thousand dying suns. I’d be willing to put up with haphazard navigation if I had more options for controlling the robot. Which this update provides.


  It won’t be enough for some folks — I admit, watching a cheaper robot vacuum continually miss the ONE AREA you want it to clean is excruciating. But at least now you can get more bang for your buck. (By the way, where the hell is iRobot’s cute ‘lil lawn bot?)

Senior Congress leader Anand Shrama, one of the 23 signatories to the letter written to Sonia Gandhi seeking an organisational overhaul, said on August 24 their intention was to convey "shared concerns" over the present environment in the county and it was done with the best interest of the party in their hearts.
 A day after a stormy Congress Working Committee meeting, where members of the "group of 23" were dissed by many for voicing their concerns, several signatories asserted that they were "not dissenters" but "proponents of revival" of the party.
 Responding to a tweet by Congress MP Vivek Tankha, in which he had said the letter was not a challenge to leadership but a parchment of action to strengthen the party, Sharma said, "Well said. The letter was written with the best interest of the party in our hearts and conveying shared concerns over the present environment in the country and sustained assault on the foundational values of the constitution."

With shopkeepers and commuters raising hue and cry over potholed Rahon road and accumulated sewer water, mayor Balkar Sandhu, MLA Sanjay Talwar and municipal commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal visited the spot on Tuesday.
 The MC officials and the contractor have been given four days to clear the accumulated sewer water from the road or face action. Executive engineer Ranbir Singh has been deputed to oversee the work.
 The MC had received a large number of complaints regarding the ongoing work of laying the sewer lines on Rahon road. Deep potholes could be seen at the spot as most part of the road had been dug up. The situation became worse during rainfall and many vehicles got stuck in the potholes. Sewer water had also accumulated on the road.
 MLA Sanjay Talwar said, "The MC officials and the contractor have been given four days to clear the accumulated sewer water from the road. The officials said that slabs of two manholes collapsed recently due to which the sewer water accumulated on the road. Further, the manholes of old sewer lines are also being cleaned so that residents should not have any problem till the time the new line is being installed."
   
   
 "The project to install new sewer lines worth ₹4 crore will be completed by September and tenders worth ₹5 crore have already been floated for constructing the road. This will benefit the 2 lakh residents living in the vicinity of Rahon road," said Talwar.

Enforcement, however, is another matter.
 "(W)e do not support county 'enforcement’ of State issued COVID guidelines. Instead, as the local public health authority, we feel it is paramount for State officials to provide easy to understand, timely access to the latest information, resources and medical guidance in order to educate residents about COVID that allows them to make informed, responsible decisions," they wrote. "This information should also flow directly to the County Commissioners, so they can share with their residents. We feel that most people will do the right thing, if given the opportunity and knowledge to do so."
 The commissioners also said it's impossible to understand the unique needs of each of Oregon's 36 counties, and the state should work directly with county commissioners.
 That's not what's happening, they wrote.
 Instead, communication has to be accessed through an "unclear maze" of emergency managers, public health officials and the Association of Oregon Counties.
 That maze, they wrote, has made it incredibly difficult for the county to access and spend relief money where it's needed most.
 “While our main priority for this pandemic has been to save lives and prevent the continued spread of the virus, we want to make it clear that we will continue to advocate for better coordination, education and communication from State Officials working directly with County Commissioners. It is imperative that the State treat us as a partner in this fight and not the enemy,” Douglas County Commissioner Tim Freeman said in a written statement.

Unfortunately, the response from the man who can best address this crisis falls somewhere between a collective yawn and a ‘meh’ thrown in for good measure. On Thursday, Gov. Ron DeSantis said the Florida Department of Corrections will continue to test and isolate symptomatic inmates. But he did not outline any other measures under consideration to prevent infections among inmates and staff members – such as the possibility of releasing inmates.
 “They are going to continue going through the testing regime, but I think the main thing is just isolating the folks who are symptomatic and likely to be spreading it, and I know they’ve worked hard to do that,” DeSantis told reporters at a news conference in Tallahassee.
 Meanwhile, social organizations across the state that focus on criminal justice reform have written letters urging the governor, Corrections Secretary Mark Inch and other state officials to reduce prison and jail populations to save lives and slow the virus spread behind prison walls. So have several state lawmakers; some of whom held a Zoom press conference on Thursday highlighting coronavirus’ carnage behind state prison walls. “Other states have implemented strategies to release those who are susceptible,” state Sen. Bobby Powell, D-West Palm Beach, said during the Zoom call, “and we are again calling on the governor and the secretary of the Department of Corrections – who has also contracted coronavirus himself – to be compassionate to look at situations where we can release those who are at high risk and prevent others from dying inside of a prison.”
 As we warned previously, more correctional officers have contracted the virus, increasing concerns of transmission to family members. Moreover, the Correctional Medical Authority, the state agency responsible for the overseeing prison healthcare programs, has stopped sending monitors to state prisons due to the virus, and Secretary Inch tested positive, giving him the distinction of being the state’s highest-ranking administrator to catch COVID-19.
 “I think our first letter to the governor was sent on March 16, and at that time there hadn’t been any known cases in Florida,” said Kara Gross, legislative director for the ACLU of Florida. “We said that this was going to happen. Our prisons are like a petri dish for this virus. Everybody knows it. The medical experts know it, and something needs to be done.”

BATON ROUGE, La. (WAFB) - LSU head coach Ed Orgeron met with sports journalists on Tuesday, August 25, as the Tigers move into their second week of fall camp practices.Orgeron started off by saying he is pleased with the mindset of the team and how the players have been avoiding distractions.With Hurricane Laura currently churning in the Gulf of Mexico on a forecast track that puts it making landfall on the Louisiana coast, Orgeron stated they are watching weather but the plan right now is to practice all week.He said the players have been learning a lot and have been injury-free for the most part. They still have lots of improvements to make and a long way to go to get where he wants them.Of course, LSU is still dealing with COVID-19 just like every other school and Coach O said the guys have to make a sacrifice if they want to play. He encourages them to go on dates with their girlfriends but stay away from parties and out of bars. He added he tells them to wear their masks and be careful.Orgeron had good things to say about quarterback Myles Brennan. He talked about the redshirt junior’s maturity and leadership. He said Brennan waited his turn but is not in the background anymore. He added the guys also believe in him.Orgeron said Racey McMath has been doing a great job and will be a starter at the No. 3 wide receiver position behind Ja’Marr Chase and Terrace Marshall Jr. He said he has also been impressed with freshman Koy Moore and thinks he’ll have an excellent season.He also talked a lot about freshman tight end Arik Gilbert, describing him as the type of tight end they’ve been looking for. They can spread him out and there are lots of things he can do. Orgeron said his staff has switched its mindset to tight ends are athletes and they can block. He also said there’s a chance for him to become No. 3 receiver down the line but they want him to learn tight end position and get good at that and then they’ll think about moving him around.Orgeron had lots to say about graduate transfer linebacker Jabril Cox. He said Cox entered the program with a great attitude, is mature, and has great character. He doesn’t talk much but he is focused and studying, according to Orgeron. The coach also said Cox is fast and brings lots of experience. Coach O called him a “complete linebacker.” On film, Orgeron said he saw a big linebacker who could key and diagnose. He added Cox was overlooked in recruiting and now gets his shot in the SEC.In the secondary, everyone knows what Derek Stingley Jr. can do. Orgeron said he has also been satisfied with fellow sophomore Cordale Flott. He added freshman Eli Ricks is coming and getting better with each practice. Orgeron thinks they’re still short there and have one more scholarship available that they may use on that position.Coach O talked about many other players.

The bigger issue likely comes on the defensive end, where Porzingis was, by far and away, their best rim protector.

 # Letter to the Editor - CYF’s The Cove wants to reopen, but it has to be done properly
 Nikk Caputo
 on behalf of the Crookston Youth Foundation board
 Dear Crookston Students and Volunteers for the The Cove-
 Students...
 We miss you! And we are looking forward to seeing you again, hopefully in the somewhat near future.
 Hopefully each of you have had a chance to enjoy the summer months, spend quality time with family and most importantly, stay healthy and safe.
 The Cove closed its doors with the onset of the Covid 19 pandemic in order to protect our students and volunteers. We have said since that point The Cove would open again when the Crookston School District opens. It seems that time may be coming this fall. At this time we do not know what protocols or schedules will be put in place by the school district. When we do know this information, the Crookston Youth Foundation Board will consider options based on the guidance and best practices that are implemented by Crookston Schools.
 We would like nothing better than to open the doors at The Cove and invite everyone back as soon as possible, but it will take time and communication to make sure we do it right.
 In the meantime, we think about the change over in leadership that has happened on our Youth Board through graduation. All of our founding Youth Board members have now moved on due to graduation and we wish them all the best in their future endeavors. We have some new Youth Board Members in place, but we will definitely be looking for additional students to join us and take The Cove, n.Vision Career Mentorship & Development and The Crookston Youth Foundation to new and exciting heights going forward. If you are a student that lives in the Crookston School District (regardless of which school you attend) and are interested in serving in a leadership role, please let us know. Our Youth Board does important work, but they also have a lot of fun.
 Volunteers...
 To our volunteers, we could not function without you! Saying that, we completely understand those that may not be comfortable supervising even with safety measures in place. Please know that your contributions in the past are so appreciated. The Cove has been like a family, with many of our volunteers becoming trusted mentors that look out for “our kids” and go above and beyond to support the students. If you know of others that would be interested in serving as volunteers, please encourage them to contact a board member.
 Look for information in the coming weeks about news at The Cove and enjoy the rest of this beautiful late summer weather.
 Nikk Caputo on behalf of the Crookston Youth Foundation Board

Nadine Ghanimeh, a psychotherapist who has also volunteered her services, said she wanted to offer presence and emotional support to those who are struggling.
 “My generation knew war for long periods of time” — the Lebanese civil war started in 1975 and ended in 1990 — “and we all know how important the human presence is ... at such times,” she said. “Once they understand that whatever they are feeling is normal and it will pass with time, this helps.”
 Ghanimeh derives hope from the scenes of solidarity playing out amid the devastation.
 “In this desolation, you would feel helpless,” she said. “Being able to act and do something about it helps both those doing the work and those at the receiving end.”
 Fatima Ismail, a painter, also turned to social media offering to use art to help people navigate their emotions after the explosion.
 In a recent Zoom session she hosted, she urged a small group to pour their feelings on paper in the form of a painting, or to visualize painting as she offered guidance. When they finished, Ismail encouraged participants to share their feelings.
 One wrote that he was happy with the experience. Another said she felt sadness.
 “How about you scribble this sadness on paper?” Ismail suggested. “The goal...is not to erase the feelings but, simply, to accept the feeling as is,” she said.
 “Let it take its time, and let it pass,” she said, “because tomorrow we will rebuild.”

 Sources stated that restoration of power supply for lighting purpose in the tunnel power station was done partially already and it could be completed soon. However, installation of the essential air-exhaust and pumping fresh air systems would take time and de-watering of the pool of seepage water from the plant is expected to be completed on Wednesday.
 “We have already come to an assessment that fourth unit is damaged to a maximum extent and the sixth unit too found to be damaged considerably in the fire. However, units one, two, three and five could be revived over the next 10 to 12 weeks starting with units one and two. We hope to revive the two units and resume generation over the next couple of weeks so that the flood season is made use of for generation of the low-cost energy and units three and five over the next couple of months,”, the official explained.
 Along with revival of the units, the generation utility has decided to focus on the upgraded safety mechanisms in the underground hydel project since the existing facilities did not help prevent the mishap or minimise the fire/damage. The official sources stated that the components which are not damaged could be tested for their functionality only after the restoration of power supply in the power station.
 Chairman and Managing Director of TS-Genco D. Prabhakar Rao is scheduled to visit the Srisailam LBHES on Wednesday to take stock of the efforts to assess the damage completely and restore basic facilities in the underground power station.

There is also the chance that tornadoes could develop as the bands rotate inland Wednesday into Thursday.Overall rain totals for the area should range between 2-5″ when all is said and done with some of that rain extending into Thursday and Friday.

In George Bernard Shaw’s “Back to Methuselah,” the serpent says to Eve in the Garden of Eden: “You see things; and you say, ‘Why?’ But I dream things that never were; and I say, ‘Why not?’”
 What’s funny is that a version of this quote is often ascribed to Robert F. Kennedy as the perfect distillation of progressive idealism.
 I don’t think Kennedy’s idealism was the root of all evil, or even remotely evil in its intent. But this idea — on display at the Democratic convention last week and an article of faith in Democratic politics — that all that prevents us from doing profound, “transformative” things is our lack of imagination can have objectively evil consequences.
 Many of the Democrats who sought their party’s nomination this year didn’t just promise to socialize medicine, enact the Green New Deal, ban fracking, etc. They also insisted that it would be fairly easy to do. The only things that prevented such transformational policies were obstruction by villainous billionaires or special interests and the failure of previous politicians to think big enough.
 More recently, progressive activists and politicians have endorsed the idea of abolishing the police and “canceling” rent.
 The first problem with this sort of rhetoric is practical. Many of these proposals are simply bad ideas on the merits. Canceling rent and abolishing the police are catastrophically dumb ideas. If you cancel rent, landlords will be unable to pay for heat or electricity, never mind repairs. Countless plumbers, electricians, janitors, painters et al. would lose their livelihoods. Landlords would default on their mortgage payments to banks. And banks would be stuck with properties that are essentially worthless, causing a cascading economic crisis that would make our current travails seem puny by comparison. And that’s if the courts let any of this happen in the first place.
 Truly abolishing the police would invite horrifying levels of violence, looting and robbery, as well as a riot of vigilantism as homeowners, business owners and other citizens took self-defense into their own hands.
 The consequences of the Green New Deal or Medicare for All wouldn’t be nearly as biblical, but reasonable people can still acknowledge they would involve massive trade-offs. Whether you think those trade-offs are worth it speaks volumes about where you stand politically.
 Even if you think it would be worth the effort to destroy the fossil fuel industry and lay waste to the health care system as we know it, spending trillions of dollars borrowed from China, what can’t be denied by serious people is that it would take enormous political effort over many years and many elections.
 In other words, even if the Green New Deal or Medicare for All are necessary and desirable, it’s grotesquely irresponsible to pretend that a single president or congressional majority could deliver them. Barack Obama moved heaven and earth to get the Affordable Care Act passed, and he barely did it. Doing so came at the cost of the rest of his legislative agenda, Democratic control of Congress, and the jobs of more than 1,000 elected officials of his own party.
 Many wonderful things have come from visionaries asking, “Why not?” — airplanes, antibiotics, vaccines, nuclear power. But the difference between scientific breakthroughs and political transformations is profound. Science begins on paper and methodically builds upward from the drawing board. The sorts of transformations politicians promise, including President Trump, try to work backward from the desired result. Science begins with A and works its way to Z. The zealots want to start with Z and work their way back to A later.
 Our constitutional system was set up to work the other way around — to start small at the local level, letting successes build upward by the power of example and the building of consensus. In recent years, though, we have become convinced that the transformation trickles down from the president rather than up from the people.
 What makes this approach so dangerous is that people believe it can work. The zealots tell voters, “All you have to do is elect me or my team, and your work is done.” Then, when reality bites back, the politicians and activists don’t say, “Hey, I was wrong. This is really hard.” They don’t blame the hard work required to forge compromise implicit in a democratic system; they blame the sinister forces — billionaires, globalists, greedy corporations, etc. — that stymied the revolution from above. And that makes sense if you actually believed their agenda was easy and cost-free in the first place.
 The serpent asks, “Why not?” because he knows the question fuels chaos and anger. The politicians ask, “Why not?” because they know not what they do.

College football games are nearing and there are disparities all across the sport.
 Three Power Five leagues – the Atlantic Coast Conference, Big 12 and Southeastern Conference – are gearing up for competition while their brethren from the Big Ten and Pac-12 aren’t due to coronavirus concerns.
 The Group of Five has split, too, and the majority of the FCS has opted to pursue a spring campaign culminating with a postseason, though, some in the subdivision have decided to still go at this fall like Austin Peay and Central Arkansas, which meet in the FCS Kickoff on Saturday at 9 p.m. It’s the first contest on the calendar this year.
 Even locally in the Commonwealth, there’s a divide.
 ACC members Virginia and Virginia Tech are in the midst of its respective training camps and so is FBS independent Liberty. But Old Dominion, a Conference USA member, and all of the state’s FCS programs, including James Madison, have shut it down until the spring. JMU even tried to play as an FCS independent this fall after its league, the Colonial Athletic Association, scrapped its season in July. But between the FCS probably holding its championship in the spring and the Dukes unable to piece together a schedule on the fly, they didn’t have much choice.
 “Philosophically we wanted to stay regional and within five hours or so,” JMU coach Curt Cignetti told the Daily News-Record of his program’s scheduling effort. “So we were on the horn with the Power Five, Group of Five and all of the FCS schools, and it was difficult. Then we hit a point in time where everyone was just in a holding pattern and not going to do anything with scheduling. I think the common response was ‘Our schedule is full and we’ll get back to you if we have an opening.’
 “But you’re even seeing now with the people that are still committed to playing [this fall], they are still putting their schedules together even today.”
 On a Zoom session with reporters this past Friday, Virginia coach Bronco Mendenhall recognized how he’s dealing with the differences in the sport.
 His son, Breaker Mendenhall, a former Western Albemarle standout, is a freshman safety at Utah State – a program that had its season canceled when the Mountain West decided it wouldn’t play this fall.
 “I think fracture might even be an understatement,” the fifth-year coach of the Cavaliers said. “The gulf in the divisions are huge. I would love consistency. I would love standardized protocols. I would love more leadership and I would love more continuity.”
 He said seeing the situation through the various points of view that he does has led him to alter his training camp this month.

 "Just to be safe, I'll quarantine myself and just take it easy," he said.
 Prime Minister Andrew Holness said police are investigating the case. He didn't specify what offense might have been committed, though Jamaica has imposed social distancing requirements due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 "They're looking into all aspects of the matter. So no one is going to be treated with any exemption or given any special treatment. All Jamaicans have a duty," he said.
 Jamaica has had fewer than 1,700 cases, a relatively low number in a country of nearly 3 million.
 On the track, Bolt was known for his poses — his "Lighting Bolt" became iconic — and of course his post-race celebrations. His speed and charisma made his sport can't-miss viewing whenever he lined up in the blocks.
 Bolt set the world records in the 100 and 200 meters at the 2009 world championships in Berlin. He retired in 2017.

FARMINGTON — A man jailed for the last 3 ½ years on a murder charge has lost a bid to be set free on bail while awaiting trial.
 Isaac Cain Lee Valdez was 18 when he and Bostin Crookston were arrested in the death of Bryan Brooks, 19, of Ogden, who was shot in the head Jan. 29, 2017, while he sat in a car at a Layton park.
 The Davis County Attorney's Office said in charging documents that Valdez and Crookston robbed three people during a drug deal.
 Both were charged with murder, aggravated robbery and obstructing justice.
 Crookston, 20 at the time, pleaded guilty March 7, 2018, to first-degree felony aggravated robbery and a reduced charge of manslaughter, a second- degree felony.
 Crookston, who admitted pulling the trigger, was sentenced to five years to life in prison on the robbery and one to 15 years for manslaughter.
 In a motion filed Aug. 11 in 2nd District Court, Valdez's attorney, Edward Brass, argued the police probable cause statement against Valdez did not warrant him being denied an opportunity for reasonable bail.
 Police said in the statement that Valdez was armed and pointed a handgun at the victims but he did not fire any shots.
 Brass said Valdez had an "insignificant" prior criminal record, although court records show Valdez pleaded guilty just four days before the murder to a class B misdemeanor assault charge involving domestic violence.
 Brass said Valdez has lifelong ties to Utah, is a father and has a job waiting if he gets out of jail.
 He has graduated from adult education while behind bars and is willing to agree to home confinement and GPS monitoring, Brass said.
 But in a bail hearing Thursday, prosecutors argued Valdez remains a risk to the community and the seriousness of the violent crime justifies he still be denied bail.
 Judge David Hamilton later ruled against the bail request.
 Valdez's trial has been delayed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Trial is set for Feb. 22, 2021.

CuriosityStream, the documentary-focused subscription streaming service created by Discovery Inc. founder John Hendricks, said it has named former Showtime chairman and CEO Matt Blank to its board of directors.
 CuriosityStream is set to go public in the fourth quarter, after its deal to merge with special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Software Acquisition Group, closes. The SAG deal is valued at about $331 million.
 Blank was chairman and CEO of Showtime for 20 years, stepping down in 2017. During his run the premium network launched such iconic series as _Dexter_ , _Ray Donovan, Homeland_ and _Weeds_.
 "Matt Blank brings an extraordinary wealth of stunningly successful media experience to the CuriosityStream board of directors," Hendricks said in a press release. "When Matt took the helm at Showtime, I watched in admiration as he built the pay service over two decades into a leading world force in premium programming with an incredible roster of valuable mega-hits and brand- defining series. All of us at CuriosityStream welcome Matt’s role on our board of directors, where he’ll provide skillful guidance and wise advice in our mission to deliver the absolute best in premium factual entertainment."
 In addition to Blank, the CuriosityStream board consists of Hendricks; Elizabeth Hendricks; president and CEO Clint Stinchcomb; Stifel, Nicolaus vice chairman investment banking Patrick Keeley; Software Acquisition Group chairman and CEO Jonathan Huberman; and Software Acquisition Group VP of acquisitions and director Mike Nikzad.
 "Matt was an early champion of the rich global opportunity in streaming blue- chip content to consumers both directly and with distribution partners of scale," Stinchcomb said in a press release. "I couldn’t be more delighted that Matt has agreed to join our board. As we grow organically and through opportunistic acquisition, Matt’s strategic guidance will be invaluable."
 In addition to his 20 years as Showtime’s chairman, Blank also served as president, chief operating officer and EVP of marketing at the premium network. Before that, he worked at HBO for 12 years in several roles, including SVP of consumer marketing.
 "I’ve known John Hendricks for over 30 years and he is truly one of the great media entrepreneurs of our time," Blank said in a press release. "There is such incredible opportunity for growth in the industry right now and I’m thrilled to join with John and his top-notch team at CuriosityStream to deliver on his core vision to share the best factual entertainment with viewers around the globe."
 Blank currently sits on the board of Cumulus Media, as well as Madison Square Garden Entertainment, and The Cable Center. He also served on the board of the National Cable Television Association (NCTA) for nearly 25 years. He has been inducted into the Cable Television and the Broadcasting and Cable Halls of Fame.

It would seem that if you want to get a rise out of Sean McDermott right now, ask the Buffalo Bills coach about the NFL's uneven policy regarding fans being allowed to attend games in person this season.
 Monday, the Miami Dolphins announced that they will be allowing a certain percentage of fans into Hard Rock Stadium - approximately 13,000 - for the start of the regular season. The Bills will be Miami's opponent for its home opener in Week 2 on Sept. 20.
 Several other teams have also announced they will allow some fans, while in New York, that does not seem to be an option for the Bills as Gov. Andrew Cuomo has not given permission for gatherings of that size.
 Clearly, having fans in the stands gives the home team at least a small home- field advantage. True, 13,000 certainly won't be able to affect the game the way 70,000 could, but it's certainly better than zero which is likely what the Bills will have at Bills Stadium this season.
 "We control what we can control," McDermott said on a Zoom call Monday morning. "I think it's honestly ridiculous that there will be ... what appears to be a playing field that is like that. Inconsistently across the league with the different away stadiums. We control what we can control. That's gotta be our mindset and that's how we attack it."
 Here's what else McDermott had to say Monday:
 Lab problem was a learning moment
 The irregularities that cropped up in COVID-19 testing at a New Jersey lab Saturday created a little angst for 11 teams, including the Bills, and certainly had some players worried about their health.
 Quarterback Josh Allen was among the Bills players who were precautionarily kept away from practice Sunday, but as it turned out his test was a false positive and he was back to work Monday for the morning session on the grass fields at One Bills Drive.
 McDermott said the Bills' organization did a great job handling the situation, and it gained knowledge for having gone through it because with the unpredictability of the coronavirus, this could certainly happen again.
 "I give the players and the staff a lot of credit; they were very positive with their approach and they went out and were resilient in terms of their mindset (Sunday)," he said. "What appeared to be a potentially very negative situation on the surface, the way we handled it, the way our players handled it in particular, to me, was a positive in terms of a growth opportunity for us as a team, and an opportunity for us to move forward as a team."
 "That's how you have to look at it. We found a way to work with it, and work through it and I think for our football team, that's the key."
 QB quarantine still possible
 Before this happened, McDermott was asked about whether the team would consider quarantining at least one of the four quarterbacks so that if there was an outbreak of COVID-19 at that most important of positions, the Bills would have someone healthy to play.
 McDermott still doesn't appear ready to take that step, but he said what happened Sunday, wasn't a scare, "But it's a reminder, though, more than anything, just overall to myself and to our football team that this can happen in a hurry. As we discussed yesterday as a team, this can take a big chunk out of your football team or your staff.
 "It's a great reminder and a great lesson for us. We were able to get some things done in a constructive way in terms of seeing what our football team looks like and how we would handle it because it could very well happen during the season. That's the reality of our situation."
 Matt Barkley got some work in
 Because Allen couldn't practice, it gave the backup quarterbacks some additional practice reps which have been in short supply.
 "It gave us a chance to look at guys that we wouldn't have had the chance to look at," said McDermott. "This could happen during the season so to have Matt take the reins on short notice in particular was a great opportunity for our football team."
 Barkley loved the additional work, but he also said it was, as Brandon Beane called it Sunday, a "good fire drill" to go through.
 "It was kind of a reality that I guess we knew would come eventually in some form or fashion given the circumstances of this year," Barkley said. "Just having the mindset of, I guess for me that I've always had as a backup, of always being ready to go, which is always what I've had to do. I guess it was just a trial run of what it would look like if it had to happen in the season."
 With Allen back on the field Monday, Barkley returned to the background along with Jake Fromm and Davis Webb.
 Pass rush is a priority on defense
 The Bills will be fielding a vastly different look up front with Jordan Phillips and Shaq Lawson gone as free agents and Star Lotulelei opting out. The team expected Phillips and Lawson to leave, and Beane made it a point to upgrade the line when he drafted A.J. Epenesa and signed free agents Quinton Jefferson, Mario Addison and Vernon Butler.
 Buffalo was a middle-of-the-pack team in terms of sacks and pressures last season, and McDermott said his defense needs to turn up the heat more in 2020.
 "I think it's a mentality more than anything," he said. "It's a mentality that coach (Eric) Washington has put into place here and a mindset that our guys have to stop the run, but also, we've got to be able to affect the quarterback.
 "It's not always sacks, but affecting the quarterback, and we had opportunities last year where we were in position but we didn't finish. And those can be the difference-making plays. We've got to continue to find six inches on every play and that starts up front and it's the ability to affect that quarterback."

The news from Florida’s most ignored hotbed of COVID-19 is getting worse: Behind bars, and away from society, the coronavirus is spreading like a California wildfire.
 In the state prisons, nearly 14,271 inmates and 2,185 staffers have reportedly tested positive for COVID-19. That’s up from “1,600 cases in 13 ‘hot spot’ facilities” just six weeks ago, when The Post Editorial Board called for more aggressive steps to curb the budding outbreak. To date, 76 inmates have died from the virus, including at least 14 who were eligible for parole, as of Thursday. And four of those were at South Bay Correctional Facility, where 342 inmates and 82 correctional officers have tested positive for COVID-19.
 COVID-19 statistics for the jails in Florida’s 67 counties are harder to come by, but the reports of higher rates of infection continue to pour in and remain troubling.

BROCKTON -- With mail-in ballots and early voting options more widely available this election season, town clerks and local election offices around the Brockton area are seeing an influx of voters participating in the state primary and a heavier workload to process ballot applications.
 In response to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, Gov. Charlie Baker introduced a new law in June allowing mail-in ballots and expanding in-person early voting for the Sept. 1 state primary and the Nov. 3 general election. State election officials sent out applications for mail-in voting, a separate ballot from absentee ballots, to all registered voters, which get returned to local town clerk and election offices to process the application and mail back a ballot for the applicant to vote.
 "I've never seen anything like it and I've worked here for over 30 years," said Raynham Town Clerk Marsha Silvia. "Especially the state primaries, there's typically not a lot of voter turnout. This is incredible, which is good! I think it's great people have the interest, but it's been incredible, like nothing I've ever seen."
 Many area election officials described turnout as slow and steady for in- person early voting for the state primary, which started Saturday and runs at local polling locations until Friday.

 "It doesn't obviously have the volume that the presidential election has, but it's going great!" said Stoughton Interim Town Clerk Stephanie Carrara. "Everyone really enjoys early voting and I have to say as a clerk, I do too. I enjoy seeing the people I don't normally see. People want to get out because they're sick of being home."
 Carrara said that masks are required during in-person early voting, with poll workers providing masks for voters that don't have them, handing out hand sanitizer and regularly disinfecting the booths, pens and glue sticks used to seal ballots.
 "We've had probably a little over 100 people every day that we've been open so far," said Brockton Elections Commission Executive Director Cynthia Scrivani. "It's going very smooth. I really like it. That's the smoothest thing in this election!"
 But with the vote-by-mail applications have come a wave of voters opting to skip in-person voting, as town clerks and election officials report that they've been inundated with vote-by-mail applications.
 "Normally, we would expect about 100 absentee ballots at this point in time," said Bridgewater Town Clerk Marilee Kenney Hunt. "Instead, we have had, as of Saturday, 2,300. I think we're going to have a bigger than normal primary election total and I think a very good portion of it came in the early votes by mail."
 In Brockton, with a population of roughly 100,000 people, Scrivani said they normally receive about 500 absentee ballots. But so far, they've received almost 8,000 applications to vote by mail, she said Tuesday.
 "I think some of the people who got (ballot) cards normally wouldn't have even voted in this election, but because they got the cards and they can vote at home," Scrivani said.
 Easton Town Clerk Danielle Sicard said about 3,000 people total voted in the 2018 primary. But as of Friday, her office had already received 4,396 vote-by- mail applications, not including totals for in-person early voters and voters on Sept. 3. And that count came ahead of the deadline to apply for a mail-in ballot for the primary.
 Local election offices must receive the application to vote in the state primary by 5 p.m. Wednesday to then send out the ballot, Sicard said via email.
 With the influx of vote-by-mail applications has come longer work days for local election offices to process applications and cross check them to make sure voters don't unintentionally try to vote multiple times, such as submitting an absentee ballot and a separate application for vote-by-mail. The extra work also comes on top of the regular non-election duties such as marriage certificates, dog licensing and other services.
 "We're bringing over buckets of those white mail buckets of ballots daily" to the post office, Carrara said, though she noted a lot of people have physically come to drop off ballots and have utilized secure ballot boxes stationed at local town halls.
 To ease the process on their offices, Hunt stressed that voters should make sure they're filling out ballots properly, which includes filling in the bubbles next to their choices fully, to make sure ballots can be counted by voting machines versus forcing the ballot to be hand-counted.
 "If the oval isn't filled in, if there are extraneous marks on the ballot or if people do write-ins ... it kicks it out because we have to look at it to see what the person is trying to say," she said. "One ballot, this isn't a big deal, but ... we've been getting in lots and lots of absentee ballots, more ballots than we would normally have in a state primary, so clearly some of those are going to be kicked out and be hand counted. I just want to minimize that ahead of time."
 Local town clerks and election officials credit their employees with managing the mammoth workload. But even with the extra work, Hunt and other town clerks have said they're happy about the number of ballots they're receiving.
 "I'm thrilled!" Hunt said. "That's not just as a town clerk, but as a person. I believe in the right to vote, I want people to exercise that right to vote and the more people who do it, the happier I am."

City Manager John Goodwin named Mathew Nielsen as chief of the Canandaigua Police Department.
 Nielsen succeeds Chief Stephen Hedworth, who retired after serving the city of Canandaigua for over 20 years as a police officer, sergeant and chief of police.
 Nielsen joined Canandaigua PD in December 2016 and became a sergeant in November 2019. He previously served with the village of Fairport Police Department, where he rose to the rank of lieutenant and was acting chief. He has 20-plus years of police experience, and shares the vision to continue a culture of community policing and initiatives.
 "Obviously, I am most proud of the family I have raised," Nielsen said. "My wife of 17 years, Kristie, is a kindergarten teacher at Marcus Whitman and we have three beautiful girls who are showing me all of the excitement that comes with girls in those teenage years. Both Kristie and I grew up in the Canandaigua area, and we are proud to call this area our lifelong home.
 "On a professional note, I am most proud of my decision four years ago to return to serve the citizens of Canandaigua. This decision was full of unknowns and was considered by others in the law enforcement profession as a big risk for a person who was at this phase of their career. This was what I consider as the best decision that I have made in my professional career.
 "Words cannot describe the fulfillment my career path has taken since coming home to work in Canandaigua. It is quite an experience to be completely connected, both personally and professionally, to your jurisdictional area of employment and its citizens. I was quite proud when I was promoted to serve as a sergeant in my hometown last year, and now I am very humbled by the amount of support and confidence that others have in me to lead the Canandaigua Police Department into the future as the chief of police."

Auteurs tend to write [themselves as a] protagonist in their films as a kind of alter ego or double. It’s not autobiographical, but I do have a kind of emotional and psychological kinship with someone like Olivia because we’re both trans women of colour and immigrants. And I know that it seems unexpected or surprising to say this, but I actually do find it easier if I act in the film because I think of it as one less person to direct. Directing is a lot like conducting an orchestra; the different crew members are the musicians, and you have to make sure that they’re playing the music right or they’re on the same page as you. By taking on these multiple roles (which I don’t necessarily consider different jobs because I have one job and that is to make a film and tell a story), I feel like it’s just easier for me to get to the final film that I’m trying to make.

He didn't specify what offense might have been committed, though Jamaica has imposed social distancing requirements due to the COVID-19 pandemic."They're looking into all aspects of the matter. So no one is going to be treated with any exemption or given any special treatment. All Jamaicans have a duty," he said.Jamaica has had fewer than 1,700 cases, a relatively low number in a country of nearly 3 million. On the track, Bolt was known for his poses — his "Lighting Bolt" became iconic — and of course his post-race celebrations.

This November would mark 8 years in WWE. 8 years!! An opportunity of a lifetime with a global company to learn, grow, make history and do things beyond my wildest dreams before I left Toronto for this adventure. I made friends, family- literally family- I met my husband here (what a fucking dreamboat) and people that will be a part of my life forever. I did things Icouldn’t have even imagined or dreamt up. From backstage interviews, a reality show, Talking Smack, being the first woman to be a part of a WWE broadcast in Saudi Arabia, tbeing the first woman to sit at the commentary desk full time on Monday Night Raw, calling Wrestlemania, anchoring a brand new show with Fox Sports (which you guys will still be able to catch me on!) I’ve been so lucky. But it’s also been a lot of my hard work, drive and passion that’s landed me in these amazing spots. I’ve had such an incredible run with WWE. It’s changed my life. But that all leads me to now. What’s next? Do I stay satisfied with what I’ve done? Or do I go in pursuit of new barriers and goals in mind? I always choose the latter. I have no idea what that means or looks like, but it’s time for me to go. Time to roll the dice again and shake things up. Time to light that fire again and forge on. Time to say bye to Renee Young and reconnect with Renee Paquette and remember why I started this journey to begin with. And as the ride slows down- as the world slows down, I see it as my opportunity to make a move. So I just wanted to say thanks to WWE and to the all the fans that have been so damn cool to me over the years. And send a crap ton of love to all of my people. I’m excited for the future! Thanks for everything ❤️

Jamaica’s Minister of Health says legendary sprinter Usain Bolt has tested positive for the novel coronavirus.
 Minister Christopher Tufton said Bolt was aware of the results and his recent contacts were being traced.
 “It is now public knowledge that Mr. Bolt has tested positive. He has been formally notified, I’m told by the authorities,” Tufton told reporters Monday evening.
 “It triggers an approach to questioning, interrogation if you will, which we follow through with contact tracing.”
 Bolt said on social media Monday that he was awaiting the result of a coronavirus test and was quarantining himself as a precaution.
 The 34-year-old retired sprinter who won gold in the 100 and 200 meters at the last three Olympics posted a video on social media to explain the situation.
 “Good morning everybody. Just waking up. Like everybody, checked social media and saw that social media says I’m confirmed of COVID-19,” he said. “I did a test Saturday, because I work. I’m trying to be responsible, so I’m going to stay in and stay here for my friends.”
 Bolt, who appeared to be lying in bed in the video, said he has no symptoms. “Just to be safe, I’ll quarantine myself and just take it easy,” he said.
 Jamaica has had fewer than 1,700 cases, a relatively low number in a country of nearly 3 million.
 On the track, Bolt was known for his poses — his Lighting Bolt became iconic — and of course his post-race celebrations. His speed and charisma made his sport can’t-miss viewing whenever he lined up in the blocks.

Murphy, of the local Chamber of Commerce, notes that Mineral County is 95% public lands, which doesn't leave a lot of room for extra beds, unless you take your own; even campgrounds and RV hookups are limited. That said, the Creede and Mineral County Visitor Center and South Fork Visitor Center are good resources for accommodations, with yurts and mountain huts, cabins and vacation home rentals, lodges and guest ranches, in addition to campgrounds. This part of the San Juans is still relatively under the radar, she said. Creede's year-round population is about 300, and there are only about 750 year-round residents in all of Mineral County. So even with the many types of accommodations, the number of actual beds available is small. Play it safe and assume that everything will require a reservation.

Patience.
 That's the key word right now as we begin to piece together what the fall sports might look like in the age of COVID-19.
 The major headline coming out of last week's MIAA board of directors meeting was that football, competitive cheer and unified basketball have all been moved to the new "Fall II" season wedged between the traditional winter and spring sports seasons. The new fourth season will run from Feb. 22 to April 25 in 2021.
 That leaves soccer, fall gymnastics, field hockey, boys golf, cross country, girls volleyball, swimming/diving and dance as the lower-risk sports that will go forward for the fall season with pre-season practices scheduled to start on Friday, Sept. 18. Whatever modifications that are mandated to play safely will be hashed out in short time starting with Thursday's meeting of the MIAA's COVID-19 Task Force .
 A member of the COVID-19 Task Force, Hingham Athletic Director Jim Quatromoni said it's a "tremendous relief" to get to this point with fall sports, but there is still more work to be done to make the upcoming season a reality.
 "The focus now is to give student-athletes an opportunity to play once again while finding a way to do it safely," Quatromoni said. "I know that the coaches and the kids are excited for this opportunity, but this is a time where we all have to be as flexible as possible and ready to turn on a dime if we need to deal with whatever modifications may come down for the individual sports."
 Marshfield Athletic Director Billy Battis said his school generally averages 500 students for the fall sports season. That number will drop with football moving to the new time frame, but he expects to see many familiar Rams when pre-season practice open next month.
 "We're all in this together right now. Coaches, players and administrators included. This is going to be a fluid situation and we all have to treat it as such in order to make everything work," Battis said. "The big thing we're all trying to do is give these kids a chance to get together safely and play sports once again."
 This is not the first year on the job that Plymouth North AD Justin Domingos envisioned, but like everyone in his position he's making the best of it.
 "The most important piece right now is giving students a chance to get back to a little more normalcy and play some games in a safe way. We're all working through the process of figuring out how to make this work," Domingos said. "The answers are coming down a little more every day as we get closer to September."
 Plymouth North classmates Caileigh Driscoll, Mike Condry and Luke Camarao have all been working hard this summer as they try to make their final fall sports season a memorable one. Driscoll is senior captain of a Blue Eagles soccer team that's trying to build on last season's playoff appearance. Condry and Camarao are both trying to carve out a starting spot on the football team.
 "I'm so excited," Driscoll said. "It's been tough not knowing what we are going to do and everyone knew there was a possibility that we weren't going to have a season. Now we have some hope and a date to get practices going. The biggest thing is we're all going to be together again. We'll adapt to whatever changes that have to be made."
 Condry and Camarao spent the summer working with PCIS physical education teacher Seto Berry as part of Plymouth North's summer conditioning program. They'll have a little break now with football moved to the "Fall II" season, but they believe the end product will be worth the wait.
 "This switch to a new season might not be all bad. I feel that if we went forward with the football season right now it might have been a watered down version of what we wanted," Condry said. "By moving to the Fall II season it will be colder but we have a better chance for it to be closer to what we've all been used to.
 "We will all continue training and getting ready for the new season."
 Camarao took the pragmatic view, saying that having a delayed football season "is still better than having no football season at all. I feel like if we tried to do football now everything would be rushed and it wouldn't be the kind of experience we are all looking for. I'm a little down right now that we won't have a regular season but it's good that we'll have the new season to look forward to with six more months to get stronger and faster."
 Scott Williams (Silver Lake girls soccer) and Stephanie Finn (Plymouth South field hockey) are veteran varsity coaches who've encountered a lot in their years on the sideline. They say they are ready to adapt to whatever modifications they are presented when they get together again with their teams.
 "I'm excited about getting everyone together once again," said Williams. "This is the definition of a fluid situation and everyone involved will have to be ready to make changes if needed to make this all work.
 "I've got a good group of seniors coming back and I think we are all ready to take the needed precautions for the safety of everyone. We're all in the same boat right now."
 Finn watched the seniors on her softball team lose their final season last spring and now she has her fingers crossed that the upperclassmen don't suffer the same fate this fall.
 'I'm fortunate to have some great kids who will do what is best for everyone because they want to be with all their teammates again. They will adapt to whatever is put in front of them in order to get this done," Finn explained. "Even if it's a shortened season, it's still a season. This is about bringing them together again safely and letting them re-connect with some friends and teammates."

 Overall, Sebring High School and The School Board of Highlands County did a pretty good job with their reopening. I was anxious to return to school and was worried for many of my peers. However, having experienced a week and knowing this is going to be the new normal for the time being, I definitely feel safer going to class.
 It is also nice seeing that the administration did not get confident with the declining cases and positivity rates. Confidence is what ultimately got us a second wave of cases that was worse than the first. I intend on not getting too confident with the strong numbers in our county and not taking my masks off unless I absolutely have to. I fully understand that the threat of the virus is still hanging over our heads and I think most students still understand that. I also intended on following all the new rules in order to stay in face-to-face learning.
 After all, being in the same room as your class with some regulations is better than being home alone and learning off of your computer.

Religion News Service had reported that Falwell resigned hours after a news story came out alleging that he and his wife, Becki, had had a yearslong sexual relationship with a business associate.
 In a statement published in the Washington Examiner, Falwell wrote that although years had gone by since the brief affair ended, the emotional toll had dragged on as his wife’s former lover threatened to expose the indiscretion publicly if they did not pay him.
 The pressure of that threat, he wrote, plummeted him into a depression that lasted even after he and his wife had worked out their issues.
 But the alleged paramour, Giancarlo Granda, told Reuters a different story. Now 29, the businessman said he had met the couple in 2012 when he was a 20-year-old pool attendant and that for six years, he and Becki Falwell had had sex numerous times while her husband watched.
 In his statement in the Examiner, Falwell said Granda was merely attempting “to deliberately embarrass my wife, family, and Liberty University unless we agreed to pay him substantial monies.”
 A university official also told The Associated Press that Falwell had resigned.
 Falwell is a pivotal figure in the U.S. evangelical political movement. His potential departure from that high-profile perch represents a remarkable fall from grace for a man who has been a potent force in American conservative politics. His surprise 2016 endorsement of Donald Trump helped the twice- divorced New Yorker win the Republican nomination for president.
 Becki Falwell, 53, is a political figure in her own right. She served on the advisory board of the group Women for Trump, which advocates for the president’s reelection campaign. She also spoke as part of a panel with her husband and Donald Trump Jr. at last year’s Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, the signature annual gathering of conservatives. Jerry Falwell and others refer to her as “the first lady of Liberty University.

Když vlak brzdí, vedením proudí 1,5 MW elektrické energie. Vytváří to hodně tepla. Elektrické měniče jsou také poměrně hlučné, takže jsme řešili, jak je ztišit. Ale zvládli jsme to a teď máme tato zařízení na dvou linkách a chystáme ho instalovat i na trase U4. Už máme vypsaný tendr na další čtyři transformátory.“
 Množství získané elektrické energie se liší podle ročního období. V zimě se totiž energie z brždění využívá k vytápění. Podle propočtu Wiener Linien ročně soupravy metra takto vyrobí tři GWh elektřiny.
 „Očekáváme, že celkově ušetříme za jeden pracovní den 3000 kWh. Během víkendu, kdy vlaky jezdí dlouho do noci to je ještě víc. S těmito úsporami energie jsme spokojení a tak budeme technologii dále rozšiřovat. Je to dobrý příklad, jak se dá optimalizovat k úsporám existující systém. To je velká výzva. Vymyslet nový úspornější systém je vždy jednodušší,“ řekla Keuschnigové s tím, že finanční návratnost projektu je zhruba osm let v závislosti na ceně elektřiny.

YouTube will do anything for more eyeballs (more data for Google), including allowing online fear-mongers to post incendiary videos designed to go viral. News reports reveal that YouTube has repeatedly ignored warnings that the platform is becoming a breeding ground for toxic, hateful content. One of the most-viewed YouTube video related to the Black Lives Matter movement is from a vocal Trump supporter who uploaded a video of himself holding an “All Lives Matter” sign in front of a grocery store in a majority-Black neighborhood; it has 14 million views. The spread of this type of extremist thinking can have deadly consequences. Last year, a terrorist gunned down 50 worshippers at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand and livesamed his attacks on Facebook, which other users then uploaded to YouTube. He made reference to a popular YouTuber associated with the far-right during the livestream, and he left behind a manifesto based on white supremacist, Islamophobic ideology that has spread online through social media platforms like YouTube.
 Like Google, Facebook is another sobering example of technology’s dark side. Facebook relentlessly pursues users for their personal data, which it then uses to sell lucrative digital ads. Fashioning itself as a digital town square, Facebook has made having an account on its platform indispensable to our work and social lives, fostering a sort of digital addiction that keeps its profits growing; in March 2019, Facebook had 2.38 billion users worldwide. Facebook’s business model is unsustainable without the ads our data makes possible; in 2019, Facebook derived 98.5 percent of all its revenue (nearly $70 billion) from ads. This steady stream of revenue enables Facebook to grow even more, perpetuating a cycle of greed that makes advertisers reliant on Facebook and keeps users more engaged with (in other words, glued to) the social media platform.
 Because there is no similarly structured social network that has the resources to substantively compete with Facebook, users are stuck with the platform, freeing Facebook to profit from the spread of dangerous ideology. Facebook knows that users are more likely to interact with polarizing material, so its algorithm frequently promotes far-right content. For example, according to tech reporter Kevin Roose of the New York Times, on June 2, eight of the top 10 most-shared posts on Facebook were from conservative sources including anti-Black Lives Matter pages “Blues Lives Matter” and “ForAmerica,” the latter of which The Atlantic describes as “the right wing’s Facebook army.”
 Together, Google and Facebook control about 90 percent of the digital advertising market, which is seriously hurting local newspapers such as the Denver Post, which has furloughed employees due to the COVID-19 recession. Local newspapers need web traffic to sell digital ad space, which is their main source of revenue; Google lowers that revenue stream by listing their articles in its search results and eliminating readers’ need to visit the website of the newspaper. By hoarding valuable online clicks that were otherwise headed to local papers, Google blocks newspapers from cultivating the online audience they need to make money from digital ads. To add insult to injury, Google does not even compensate papers for the use of their content; Facebook only started to compensate select publishers for posting the links to their articles in October 2019 after prolonged outcry from newspapers. Similar to Google, Facebook makes money from the ads it displays as users scroll through newspaper articles on their news feeds.

Yes, well first of all, the lead times in that industry are long enough that Q4 virtually had no impact in its sales and margins from the slowdown in aviation, but we did call out we expect a significant decline in the quarter and the related deleverage would flow through to the profitability in the quarter. We have all along conveyed that this business as we’ve repositioned it in the last few years to focus on space and aviation was heading towards a plus-15% EBIT range, and it has delivered in several quarters in the last year, so it was getting there. With this reduction in build rates in aviation in Airbus and Boeing, that has pushed that out so this business is headed for a tough few quarters, and we just have to watch very closely the build rates when they begin to ramp up again, because that volume will be critical to deliver 15% EBIT long term in the business.

  His issues are: Composition of the KRMA board, pilot fees access by Kankakee, KRMA’s financial practices, sewer plant capacity and flow, and laboratory testing fees.


  The audit and legal counsel, he said, are needed to “examine the legality of the governance of the current administration, operation and fiscal accounting practices of KRMA. Even after all the scandals and alleged corruption, KRMA’s Board of Directors has done little to mitigate risk at KRMA, he said.


  “Moreover, the KRMA Board of Directors stated that they have done and will continue to do a fine job in managing KRMA,” he said.


  Romo concluded that with Kankakee controlling the board majority, nothing with change at KRMA unless Bradley takes these initiatives.

So as states and cities engineer sensible reopening policies, everyone is going to have to assess their risk tolerance and cautiously push their personal boundaries bit by bit.
 Some, of course, never got to make this decision. Risk tolerance is about duty and conscience but very often it’s also about how much you need a paycheck.
 Doctors, nurses and others who work in health care had no choice but to dive in. These folks did not, as so many have claimed, go into the profession “knowing the risks.” They came to work knowing that the risk of infectious diseases could be controlled with careful precautions. That’s why they felt angry and betrayed when they were asked to fight the novel coronavirus without an adequate supply of protective gear or (in some places) training about the new pathogen. And, tragically, some died as a result.
 Now many physicians I know in COVID-19 hotspots say they actually feel safest in the hospital, where procedures like masking and sanitizing are assiduously followed. (Hell hath no fury like a surgeon who witnesses a medical student touch a sterile surface with an unsterile hand.) In contrast, on the sidewalk, the coronavirus could be roaming free if people aren’t wearing masks.
 Which is why masking should be mandated and enforced. It’s not just about your individual risk tolerance but about keeping everyone safe.
 In addition to wearing masks and social distancing when not at home, we should avoid prolonged periods in indoor spaces with crowds or strangers; wash or sanitize our hands — a lot — and try not to touch “high-touch” surfaces that hundreds of people have grabbed before. (Note to my local post office: You should have some kind of automatic door rather than require everyone to pull the handle!)
 And we have to demand that anywhere we go — bookstores, medical offices, trains or hair salons — requires that patrons follow these guidelines. I, for one, won’t enter if they don’t.
 I do not blame teachers for being unwilling to return to school in places where administrators and officials have been in denial about COVID-19 or have been unwilling or unable to do this preparatory work. But once schools have put in place appropriate science-based steps, most teachers (those not in high-risk groups) should return to their jobs.
 COVID-19 is a very serious disease. But it is not the Black Death, which killed up to half of Europe in the 14th century. A vaccine, when and if it arrives, will be a big help. But in the meantime, we have science. We know what causes COVID-19. We are learning more about how to detect, prevent and treat it every day.
 So instead of taking your temperature and checking your pulse oximeter reading twice a day, it may be time to take stock of your risk tolerance. In those places where governments, businesses and administrators have set the stage properly, we can — with sensible precautions — begin to live again.

Florida Cares Charity, a West Palm Beach-based inmate advocacy organization, is writing its third letter to the governor, said Denise Rock, the group’s executive director who also believes reducing the prison population is the only way to end the horror stories from people whose family members or friends are incarcerated. Lately, her group has been getting calls from clients about staff shortages that have made it difficult to feed inmates.
 “Yesterday a mom told me her son called to say all six chefs that normally cook the food got COVID-19,” Rock said. So, the officers were cooking the food, the officers were doing the laundry, and he saw an officer cutting the grass and the warden picking up the garbage. That’s why I say I can’t find fault with the department of corrections; and I know a lot of people want to get upset with the department because they are the ones housing their loved ones. But, I think they’re doing the best they can in holding it together.”
 Apparently, our governor hasn’t thought this thing through. Society shouldn’t think COVID-19 will remain locked away behind bars. The reality is that coronavirus respects no boundaries – be they county lines, political ideology or prison walls. Instead of ignoring the outbreak, the governor should use the many tools he has to resolve the problem.
 DeSantis, for example, could order the department to identify those inmates who have one year or less left on their time and to grant them early release. An executive order can lead to the release of elderly and medically vulnerable individuals who pose no significant risk to society. Also, he could use his influence on the state Commission on Offender Review to take the virus into account when determining parole eligibility. In the past fiscal year, the commission only granted parole to 28 inmates, less than 2 percent of the 1,454 parole cases it considered.
 Other states – including Delaware, Maine, Massachusetts, Missouri, New York, Ohio and Oklahoma – have taken the necessary steps to ease their prison populations by releasing elderly, nonviolent and low-level technical violators; which has helped bring some semblance of social distancing, and curbed the drastic impact of the virus on inmates and staff.
 Florida should join them. As Rock so eloquently noted in Florida Cares’ second unanswered letter to the governor: “Every day you choose to ignore mounting infections and death, the problem gets worse. At some point, inaction begins to look like impotence.”
  _An editorial from the Palm Beach Post._

There seems to be a growing consensus that the best way to deal with the coronavirus is with authority. Absent a true global authority, which may never be, we still look for this authority to be central in a nation-state, flowing from the one to the many, in a president or a prime minister or even, still, a king.
 In the U.S., there is also the sense that if we could just get back to those storied times in our past when we all pulled together to surmount tremendous obstacles, led, perhaps, by a president who told it to us straight and laid down the law, then we would be all right; to a time when we would act first and ask questions later; a time when we would just follow orders. But have we ever been those people?
 In part this seems to be a confusion with Winston Churchill leading Britain through its darkest hour — although he was not asking for more than people were already giving owing to the Luftwaffe trying to kill them. It’s right church, wrong pew.
 World War II began later for Americans, after the attack on Pearl Harbor, in December 1941. On Christmas Day, the British garrison at Hong Kong surrendered to the Japanese. A few days later, American forces fled Manila, barely ahead of the Japanese. On Feb. 15, Singapore fell to Japan, opening the beginning of the way to India and Australia – and all of this imperiled the fortunes and even the national security of the U.S., which had always been guarded by its two great oceans.

"We have a lot that we have dealt with, that we have gone through and we had no one to turn to," Deon Derrico said, "There was no book to read. There was no one that resembled us or resembled our situation that we could refer to."
 When the show begins, there are 11 Derrico children, ages 2 to 14, including quintuplets. Karen Derrico is pregnant with triplets in the first few episodes.
 Their children were all conceived naturally and without in vitro fertilization, the couple said.
 The family is African American and the series feels especially timely given recent discussion regarding cultural attitudes about Black mothers breastfeeding, as well as infant mortality rates in the Black community.
 Karen Derrico, who has breastfed all her children, advocates for it, she said, because they suffered two miscarriages before the birth of their first child and a subsequent miscarriage after.
 "One day I was just praying and I'm like 'God, if you bless me with the baby, I want to encompass all of motherhood as far as breastfeeding and just coddling and holding,'" she said. "No one in my family breastfed, no one. So it was something I guess needed as far as motherhood for me."
 Viewers will get to see how she deals with the early delivery of their latest sets of triplets and insight into how they manage with such a large family.

The resolution was that John Doe was killed, right? Think about that, and then think about how many other people like John Doe were living in the city and how many, after picking up on what he'd done, might decide to play copycat? It wasn't over, since only one chapter had been closed, leaving a lot of others to potentially be opened. Whether Somerset would actually be staying on is hard to say, but Mills' career was likely over since he shot a suspect in cold blood, and his life was essentially over since his pregnant wife that he loved so dearly was dead, killed by the same man he would end up killing. It was an end, not a resolution.

For dinner, Dave chose the black, blue, and bacon burger. It was so large that Dave couldn’t finish it! I wanted one of their unique entrees, fried chicken, and mashed potatoes, but with a twist. The chicken breast was sliced in half and lightly breaded, then fried. I have to say — that was one big chicken! It was served with homemade mashed potatoes then covered in white gravy. The side was a blend of sautéed veggies, summer squash, onions, and carrots. These were amazing. My doggy bag lasted for at least three full meals.


  The portions are generous, and the prices are very reasonable. Other dinner items are rib-eye steak, salmon, shrimp, and apple bourbon-glazed pork chops.


  They offer a variety of salads, including the black and blue salad, a buffalo salad along with several others.


  The burger menu has a vast selection of burgers, including a salmon burger or a turkey burger. All burgers come with your choice of sides, including fries, salad, western mac, and cheese or a B.L.T. pasta salad. Other sandwiches are the steak and portabella sandwich, barbecue pork chop sandwich, a crawfish po’boy, a B.L.A.T., which is a bacon, lettuce, avocado, and tomato on sourdough bread. They offer a kid’s menu with the usual kid’s fare.


  Now, don’t fill up on dinner because they have some really cool desserts like The Horns. It’s huge! Salted caramel pretzel crusted brownie topped with two ice cream cones, whipped cream, and drizzled in chocolate. It will feed not one, two, or even three — it’s that big! No, we didn’t order one, we were full.


  Head out for their Sunday Funday and try one of their Mega Bloodys, stuffed with everything in the kitchen!

 “The City Council needs to take another look at the Brickhouse project in light of the discussion, near the end of the council meeting on Aug. 10, on (planned unit developments) that allow for high density redevelopment of older buildings in neighborhoods with low density. It was mentioned that this was the very first time that such a project had been allowed."
 Four of seven council members voted to override the veto and allow the developer to begin construction. But to overturn a veto, a simple majority is not enough. Five of seven council members had to pass the vote for the apartments.
 The community input for this project was mixed. While some residents voiced the desire to see more housing -- specifically affordable housing in Red Wing -- others raised questions of increased density, more traffic and the parking lot that was proposed to be built between the apartment building and the Golden Lantern.

 Our Post Office is responsible for getting it there and has done so, without fail, for months. Mail call for me while serving in the Marine Corps was priceless. It was our connection with home. Mail call for my father at age 100 is no different. It's life-saving!

But Exxon has been the most venerable, which makes its fall off the average so shocking. The company was the longest-tenured firm until Monday’s announcement it would get the boot at the end of this month. The immediate driver was Apple splitting up its stock after becoming the first American company to pass $US2 ($3) trillion in market value. If you’re the type that has stonks or finds them interesting, you can read all about Apple’s stock split in more detail here, but for our purposes, it’s enough to note that it affected the weight of tech stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. To fix that, it shook up what companies were listed, pushing Exxon off the plank as well as Pfizer and Raytheon. It also added Salesforce, pharmaceutical company Amgen and conglomerate Honeywell.


  Exxon’s fall neatly mirrors Apple’s rise. At one time, Exxon was in Apple’s position as the most valuable American company. Exxon was valued at $US400 ($558) billion as recently as 2011; CNBC said in 2008 that it attained that value because it was a “safe haven” and “not going anywhere.” Fast forward 12 years, and it’s clear Exxon is anything but.

ENTERPRISE - Local teams have endured five months of no sports activity, but that all came to an end on Monday as East Union traveled to West Union and won the season opening volleyball match 3-1.
 "Well, we were very nervous the first set and I looked at Coach (Kalicia Henderson) and said 'you'd think it'd been six months or something since they played,'" East Union coach Josh Blythe said. "We are trying to do stuff differently and trying to do it the right way, so it's a learning curve still for us and there's a lot of rotations that we are trying to do.
 "We're trying to get certain people in certain places, but at the end of the day, you are still trying to pass, set and kill it."
 West Union took the first set 25-17 and never allowed East Union to lead while there were two ties at 10-10 and 16-16.
 East Union came back to even the match with a 25-19 decision in the second set. The Lady Urchins overcame a 7-5 lead by the Lady Eagles during Abby Patterson's service and by the time West Union was able to break the serve, Patterson had helped her team run off seven straight points to go up 12-8.
 The Lady Urchins won the third set 25-15 to go ahead 2-1 in the match. Mia Hutcheson had a key service for East Union as she helped the Lady Urchins open up a six point lead and West Union could not get any closer than six for the remainder of the set.
 The fourth and final set saw East Union rush out to an early 9-1 lead as they coasted to a 25-14 decision to win the match 3-1.
 "I thought we just made a lot of mental mistakes and that's what you expect, but they're (West Union) a lot better too, so you've gotta give them props too," Blythe said.
 East Union got key contributions from several players and Blythe singled out the play of Hope Robbins as being critical in the win.
 "We messed up a rotation and I had to have another blocker, a middle blocker, so I just threw her (Robbins) in there and she made a couple of big blocks, a couple of good kills and I'm like okay, let's just keep going," he said. "You've just got to develop some sort of consistency and I think that's what you see with these young groups, they are learning how to play still.
 "It's just a process, you know, and my head hurts after the fact because I'm trying to figure and I'm spinning on what we're going to do and who we are going to do it with, but they played well. It's good just to play, I'm excited, even though we've got masks on, I'm just excited to play."

During the summer of 1962 I accepted an internship to study mammalian genetics at the Roscoe B. Jackson Memorial Laboratory (JAX) in Bar Harbor, Maine. Roscoe was President of the Hudson Motor company, who seeded the JAX laboratory in 1929 with a gift of $60,000 for the purpose of developing new medical treatments for human diseases. Today the Jackson Lab is a world leader in medical research, employing 2,500 at facilities across the country, as well as two outposts in China — one of them in Wuhan. Twenty-six Nobel Prize winners have conducted their research at JAX.
 Early in its history, JAX decided to use the mouse as its research model for understanding the human genome. It may come as a surprise to learn we share 98% of our genes with the humble mouse. More than 11,000 strains of cloned and, yes, genetically modified mice can be ordered from its breeding program for specialized investigations. Scientists can request alcoholic, diabetic, ALS and Alzheimer’s-prone populations from the JAX catalog. As the largest provider of “lab mice” in the world, it is revenue from three million annual sales that generate much of the revenue needed to support JAX research.
 Mice are not usually susceptible to infection by corona viruses; but, as luck would have it, a corona prone mouse was genetically engineered at JAX during the 2007 SARS outbreak. Its transgenic code was frozen and placed into cryonic storage as a precaution after the SARS epidemic was largely extinguished. Early this year that SARS genome was pulled from the freezer vaults. By late March JAX had nurtured a sizable population of research subjects that would produce corona antibodies. They were then dispatched to medical teams around the world. Several weeks ago, the Jackson staff and its affiliated researchers held a Zoom conference to update researchers on what they’ve learned about COVID-19.

He pointed to the fact he was one of 18 Conservatives MPs to support C-279, an NDP private members' bill introduced under the Stephen Harper government that sought to prohibit discrimination based on gender identity.
 It's often cited as an early model of a bill later passed by the Liberals that enshrined gender identity as a prohibited grounds for discrimination in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms in 2017.
 O'Toole abstained from that later vote on the Liberal legislation.
 He has also said he will march in Pride parades, but will not march in the Toronto Pride parade specifically until police officers are allowed to march in uniform as well.

I hear too many people saying “I’m not going back to life until there’s a vaccine” — as if that will immediately eliminate the risk. It won’t. Even if one of the current vaccine candidates works, it could be quite a while before it’s widely distributed. And to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration, it must protect only half of the people taking it from infection.
 For the foreseeable future, we will be living in a world with some level of the coronavirus out there. So if we want to get out of our bunkers, we all need to take stock of our risk tolerance.
 As a doctor, I worked in a New York City emergency room and in a remote coastal clinic in Kenya, and then I became a journalist covering disease. I’ve had to measure my risk tolerance for infection in different situations.
 Once, collecting blood from an AIDs patient, I couldn’t feel the artery through my glove. The glove came off.

To partially offset these risks, as a competitive advantage, the Heplisav-B product has shown greater efficiency and efficacy in protection with Hep-B using only two doses over a single month, which is in contrast to the gold standard three-dose regimen that spans over six months. Provided the company establishes effective distribution routes and teams with the right providers, there is a huge chance DVAX's approach will become the new gold standard, which presents an enormous market opportunity, particularly if approved in Europe, also.
 ## Conclusion
 We are bearish on DVAX, purely on the basis of the quantitative factors we have examined as a part of this report and our in-house analyses using our own proprietary research modelling. Whilst the company has shown headway in Heplisav-B alongside potential applications of the CpG 1018 adjuvant, we feel that DVAX has to demonstrate greater capacity from management and market acceptance to fulfill a bullish outlook, as, currently, the analysis doesn't support this sentiment, in our view. Combined with the amount of returns that DVAX stock has given away over the previous 3+ years to date, we also feel the market has yet to realise the value that may exist in DVAX's operations, provided they get it right and deliver on the sales expectations of their hero products. We hope to see a better Q3 performance, on the back of the economy slowly reopening and with vaccination utilisation returning to pre-COVID-19 levels, whereby we can gauge a perhaps more accurate snapshot of company performance based on the fundamentals discussed in this report, amongst others. We would encourage investors to perform a deep dive analysis to be in the best position to make the most informed decisions possible.

I will reserve judgment though on whether he should be given a chance to make those trilogies until I finally get to see the movie and see if it really is going to be as cool as the trailer make it look, or if Fox was right about it all along and the movie is not all quite all there.

“It has become a very serious situation with a landfall likely,” Ben Schott, meteorologist in charge with the National Weather Service’s New Orleans office, wrote in an email. “Wind in excess of 161 km [per hour] maybe seen well inland and do significant damage, as well as heavy rainfall and associated flooding.”


  Nine counties in Texas and Louisiana, including major jurisdictions, have issued mandatory evacuations and are setting up emergency storm shelters. All told, more than 385,000 people in Texas alone are being asked to get out of the way of a dangerous storm. But amid the covid-19 pandemic, these response plans could create crises in their own right.


  Some areas that could be hit by the storm are still reeling from hurricane season in years past as well. On Tuesday morning, the NHC expanded its hurricane watches to include parts of Texas’ Harris County, including Houston. Just three years ago, Hurricane Harvey flooded over 96,000 homes in Houston, and many are still struggling to rebuild.


  This year’s extreme hurricane season has lived up to forecasts and then some, with a record pace for storms and bizarre storm tracks. A recent update to the forecast as we entered the heart of hurricane season showed things were likely going to get even worse due to the growing odds of La Niña, a natural weather pattern in the Pacific that can create wind patterns ripe for Atlantic hurricanes to form.


  Laura is thriving in the abnormally warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico. Rising ocean heat is one of the most consequential impacts of the climate crisis. Arse the climate warms, hurricanes themselves are becoming more and more severe, too. Sea level rise is another huge impact because it allows storm surge to push further inland and cause more destruction. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, storm surges that occur today are eight inches higher than they would have been in 1900.

Rhian Brewster is often not very involved in games, but in the box, he’s a live-wire.
 His finishing, in fact, is special.
 Today, the youngster came on in the second-half and salvaged Liverpool a 2-2 draw after we went in 2-0 down at half-time to Rb Salzburg following a strange opening 45 minutes that featured the strongest XI available to Jurgen Klopp.
 His first goal saw him collect the ball off James Milner, open his body up and side-foot it into the roof of the net.
 Brewster scored last time out against Stuttgart as well and is doing everything he can to be involved with the first-team squad this season.
 Is he ahead of Divock Origi in the pecking order?

Similarly, conservative activist and Trump supporter, Candace Owens who was previously criticized after denying the existence of white supremacy and citing Black on Black crime and a lack of masculinity in men as the cause for some of the socio-cultural challenges that are prevalent in the Black community was under fire yet again shortly after the George Floyd shooting. Owens called Floyd a “violent criminal” referencing his robbery conviction in 2005 in which he served seven years for armed robbery. Although stating that Floyd did not deserve to die after his neck was knelt on by police for almost nine minutes straight, she said that he should not be seen as a “martyr” and inferred that his past criminal record made him exempt from any form of value or valor. Some argue that Owens completely missed the mark with her conceptualization of the protests that followed Floyd’s death.

On Sunday, after being called to the scene of a domestic disturbance, two Wisconsin police officers drew their weapons on the back of 29-year-old Jacob Blake which resulted in him being shot eight times. After countless hours of surgery on Monday, as of today — miraculously — he is reported to be in stable condition but suspected paralyzed from the waist down and both officers have been placed on administrative leave while Wisconsin police investigate the horrific incident. While it remains unclear why police were called to the scene, it is clear that Blake did not have a weapon, was shot with his back turned to police, and did not pose a threat to the officers. Even worse, similar to Philando Castille, Jacob Blake was shot in front of his three children who are 3, 5, and 8 years of age. Although one of the officers responsible for the shooting was not wearing a bodycam, footage of the shooting was caught on a cell phone and quickly spread across social media. Shortly after the video of the shooting went viral, waves of protests erupted across the Kenosha Wisconsin, a city of 100,000 residents – of which almost 80% are white and less than 12% are Black.
