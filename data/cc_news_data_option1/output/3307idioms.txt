Genevieve, which had been a powerful Category 4 hurricane with winds of 130 mph (215 kph) on Tuesday, had weakened to a tropical storm Thursday as it moved northwestward in the Pacific off Mexico's Los Cabos tourist resorts. The hurricane center said the storm was expected to continue weakening through the night, likely becoming a tropical depression by Friday evening.


  The hurricane center said Genevieve’s maximum sustained winds had dropped to 50 mph (85 kph) Friday morning, and it was centered about 130 miles (210 kilometers) west-southwest of Cabo San Lazaro. It was moving to the west- northwest at 10 mph (17 kph).


  The storm knocked out power and phone service to a large part of the Los Cabos area, flooded streets in poor neighborhoods and toppled palms in the tourist zone. High surf claimed two lives Tuesday as the storm approached the area.


  Baja California Sur state officials said 15,000 foreign tourists were in the state, most in the Los Cabos region, which earlier had almost been emptied of visitors by pandemic restrictions.

The Iranian foreign ministry said it also summoned the UAE charge d'affaires to protest the maritime incident, which took place on Monday. UAE coastguard vessels had "opened fire on several Iranian fishing boats... leading to the deaths of two fishermen", a statement by the ministry said.
 An "Emirati boat was seized by coast guards of the Islamic republic of Iran because it was sailing illegally in our waters, and its crew have been arrested," it added.
 The official Emirati news agency WAM said eight fishing boats had violated its own territorial waters on Monday, without giving their nationality. "The coastguard boats attempted to stop the fishing boats but they did not comply with the orders, therefore, rules of engagement were applied", WAM added.
 Iran's foreign ministry said the UAE had on Wednesday expressed "its deep regret" and said it would provide compensation.
 Iran and the UAE have longstanding economic links and the Emirates are home to a significant Iranian expatriate community. But tensions have spiked between the two nations following last week's surprise announcement that the UAE has agreed to normalise ties with Israel under a US-brokered deal.
 Iran condemned the agreement, with President Hassan Rouhani calling it a "big mistake" and warning "against opening the path of Israel to the region", without elaborating on what that would mean.
 Rouhani's remarks were seen as "threats" by the UAE which on Sunday summoned the Iranian charge d'affaires in Abu Dhabi to protest "unacceptable and inflammatory" rhetoric.
 The UAE, which downgraded its relations with Iran in 2016 amid fierce rivalry between Tehran and Emirati ally Saudi Arabia, said the remarks "had serious implications for security and stability in the Gulf region".
 Establishing diplomatic ties between Israel and Washington's Middle East allies, including the oil-rich Gulf states, has been central to US President Donald Trump's regional strategy to contain Iran.
 On Wednesday, Trump said the United States will activate a controversial mechanism aimed at reimposing UN sanctions on Iran known as "snapback". This follows last week's defeat of the US at the UN Security Council where it failed to muster support for a resolution to extend a conventional arms embargo on Iran.
 Tehran has been at loggerheads with Washington since 2018, when Trump unilaterally withdrew from a historic 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers and reimposed US sanctions.
 "Snapback" aims to restore all international sanctions against Iran that were lifted as part of the 2015 accord with Tehran. But on Thursday, in apparent defiance of Washington, Tehran unveiled two missiles it said had an extended range, naming them after commanders killed in a US strike in January in Iraq. One of them, unveiled as a ballistic missile, was called "Haj Qasem" in honour of top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, while the other, a cruise missile, was named after his Iraqi lieutenant Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis.

  Ingram Micro’s usage of Microsoft Teams isn’t just relegated to its product distribution however, as it is also utilising it within its own business practice.


  The service, alongside phone and email, was highlighted in a letter signed by commercial and consumer sales directors Aidan Fitzgerald and Rob Wilkinson, respectively, to Victorian partners as a means of communicating with its customers during stage 4 restrictions in the state.

“The PDA has been applying delaying tactics since long despite receiving payments for the development work in the media colony. We have no other option but to go to any extent to snatch our rights, Imran Yousafzai, the general secretary of the Peshawar Press Club told an emergency meeting held here on Thursday. A large number of media persons including senior journalists and allottees of the media colony attended the meeting.
 Expressing anguish and anger over the pathetic attitude of the PDA authorities, the journalists said that they had paid dues to the entity for the development work including provision of electricity, gas, water supply but now it was not ready to fulfill its responsibility. The general secretary said that most of the journalists had paid fees to the PDA for taking possession of the respective plots but a mafia was active and creating hurdles in the process.
 He alleged that certain elements at the PDA offices were patronizing land- grabbers that was why they did not allow honest officials to carry out uplift work at the media colony so they could buy plots from the journalists at a throw away price.
 “We are now compelled to come to the roads against the rampant corruption, nepotism and red-tap in the PDA,” the journalists vowed. Setting a three-day deadline to the PDA for the supply of electricity, gas, water and provision of other facilities, they said they would follow ‘now or never’ policy to push the entity for prompt action.
 The journalists would stage a protest outside the PDA offices in Hayatabad on August 24 if it did not launch work in the stipulated time. They also decided that a protest sit-in would also be launched outside the PDA offices and would continue until the uplift work completed.

The Ministry of Finance high-ups briefed a selected group of reporters to convince that the cost of borrowing (difference between offered rates on bonds such as PIBs and policy rate) was 4.1 percent higher by end June 2018 that was brought down to 1.2 percent in fiscal year 2019 and fiscal year 2020.
 They were of the view that the higher cost of borrowing increased incentives for bankers because they invested into short-term debt by offering rate at their dictates knowingly that the government had become desperate borrower.
 Special Secretary Finance Mohsin Mushtaq Chandna and Director Debt Office Ministry of Finance Omar Zahid briefed reporters on Thursday and said that average time of maturity of domestic debt was improved substantially as under the IMF programme the borrowing from the State Bank of Pakistan retired on one hand to the tune of Rs570 billion in last fiscal year 2019-20 and Rs285 billion in July 2020, but the short-term debt profiling was also shifted from three and six months to over 12 months maturity period. So the short-term debt maturity was improved from 75 to 50 percent despite higher financing needs and imposition of ban on borrowing from the central bank under the IMF programme conditions. They also mentioned that the borrowing from the SBP increased manifold when Islamabad was not under the IMF programme as it became standalone in 2019 just ahead of the IMF programme. The government borrowed more money from the SBP for creation of buffer but it was good move because it helped the government avoid getting dictations from the bankers. They defended the government move to raise Rs22 billion through domestic bond and dispelled the impression that the government offered higher rates on domestic bond. They were of the view that the government re-introduced 15 years maturity bond as it was issued last time in 2011. So it was again introduced. They said that the spread on issuance of domestic bond stood at 4.1 percent during the period from 2013 to 2017-18 despite this fact that the policy rate was on lower side. Now the policy rate was on higher side, but the spread gap reduced significantly so they claimed that the debt management was done through hiring of professionals.
 The Ministry of Finance high-ups argued that the total public debt stock increased by Rs3.5 trillion because of depreciation of rupee against dollar. The exchange rate was kept at certain through artificial means so it had to bear the cost by end of the day, they added.
 The total domestic debt stocks stood at Rs3.3 trillion in 2007-08 that went up to Rs9.5 trillion in 2012-13. This domestic debt stocks increased to Rs16.4 trillion till fiscal year 2017-18 and it now touched at Rs 23.2 trillion. The external debt that stood at Rs2.9 trillion in 2007-08 ballooned to Rs4.8 trillion in 2012-13, Rs8.5 trillion in 2017-18 and now peaked to Rs13.1 trillion in 2019-20. The total public debt stocks excluding liabilities stood at Rs6.1 trillion in 2007-08 and went up to Rs14.3 trillion in 2012-13. The total public debt stocks increased to Rs25 trillion in 2017-18 and now it escalated to Rs36.3 trillion in 2019-20. It was not mentioned in the briefing of the Finance Ministry, but if total public debt and liabilities were taken into account it had gone up to Rs42.8 trillion till end March 2020. The State Bank of Pakistan has not yet released end June 2020 data of total public debt and liabilities. The borrowing from central bank as percentage of total domestic debt stood at 28 percent by end of June 2018 that had now worsened to 38 percent in June 2020, but it was reduced from 44 percent from last year 2019-20.

Pharr’s literary voice centered Black voices, mainly people from the margins of American society, depicting their lives in an unvarnished manner with cynicism and hope. No respectability politics for him. In his few available published interviews, Pharr cites being inspired by the writing approach of Sinclair Lewis, who was known for his poring observational tone. This approach was the basis for his first and most successful novel, _The Book of Numbers_ , published in 1969. Pharr’s candid look at two men who create a numbers racket in the Black community of Richmond, Virginia in the 1930s garnered attention for its look at two waiters, Blueboy Harris and Dave Greene, who briefly achieve success before seeing it all end in tragedy. _S.R.O.,_ about a waiter’s life in a single room occupancy hotel in Harlem, and dark comedy _Giveadamn Brown _followed __ right after. Each of these novels drew heavily from Pharr’s own life experiences and observations as a longtime waiter after he graduated from Virginia Union in 1937—he was 53 as he was on the job at the Columbia University Faculty Club when he arranged for a professor to read his manuscript.

SPRINGWATER -- A Monroe County resident has been arrested on felony charges after an investigation into an ATV crash the early morning hours of July 4, Livingston County Sheriff Thomas J. Dougherty said Thursday.
   
 On July 4, at approximately 2:25 a.m., Sheriff's Deputies and Emergency Personnel responded to Miller Road in the Town of Springwater for the report of an ATV crash that had just occurred. Responding emergency units found the operator of the ATV in the roadway with serious injuries.
   
 The operator of the ATV was identified as Donald J. Boykin Jr., 35, from Brockport.
   
 Boykin was transported to Strong Memorial Hospital by Mercy Flight for treatment of his injuries which included a traumatic head injury. Investigating Deputy Sheriffs suspected that Boykin was under the influence of alcohol. A records check also revealed that Boykin had a revoked driver's license due to a previous DWI related conviction on Nov. 16, 2015.
   
 Deputy Justin Hilt responded to Strong Hospital to conduct a DWI investigation which included obtaining a blood sample to test Boykin's blood alcohol content (BAC). The blood was sent to a forensic lab for testing.
   
 On Aug. 18, Boykin was arrested and charged with felony Driving While Intoxicated, felony Aggravated Unlicensed Operation of a Motor Vehicle in the first degree along with violations of the NYS Vehicle and Traffic Law after lab results showed that Boykin had a BAC of .15%. The DWI and AUO charges were felonies due to Boykin's previous DWI related conviction in 2015.
   
 Boykin was turned over to Central Booking Deputies at the Livingston County Jail for processing and released on appearance tickets as the offenses did not qualify for pre-arraignment detention under the NYS Justice Reform Act. Boykin will answer to the charges at a later date in the Town of Springwater Court.
   
 Also assisting with the investigation from the Sheriff's Office was Investigator Connor Sanford, Sergeant Chad Draper, Deputy Menzo Peck, Deputy Mike Wade, and Sergeant Chad VanAuken from the Forensic Identification Unit.

If you get lost with the arithmetic of this example, do not worry: Dad is a widower whose monthly income is $4,200. His monthly insurance cost is $200, which is a deduction from his income. His monthly cost of nursing care is $10,100. If he had $6,000 more income per month, his income less insurance deduction would still be $100 less than his cost of care. He has $425,000 of total resources remaining, including the value of his now-empty house, to be spent-down before becoming under resourced and “otherwise eligible” for MA, but for the penalty period.
 The penalty divisor is the average monthly cost of nursing care in Pennsylvania. Assuming that divisor is $11,000, if Dad gave $264,000 to his children, this would result in a penalty of 24 months being assessed by DHS, which would determine a specific future date when Dad would be eligible. Dad’s income could be increased with a $144,000 annuity that would pay $6,000 per month during the 24 months of the penalty period to offset not quite all the monthly cost of care.

Besides its on-going inquiry into the issuance of liquor licence to a private hotel, the Bureau’s Lahore office is also in the process of complaint verifications into allegations of corruption against the chief minister in several government contracts given to selected parties in exorbitant rates.
 However, no concrete evidence has been received as yet by the NAB against the chief minister, whose close relatives and officers (who served with him) are also being questioned.
 “We have not reached the stage where we can consider arresting the Punjab chief minister,” a senior NAB official told The News on condition of anonymity. He disclosed that as against the claim made by the chief minister, the NAB has not yet received details of his assets as were sought in a specially designed asset performa handed over to Buzdar by the Bureau.
 It is said that the NAB has also sought asset details from some bureaucrats, closely related to the chief minister. The complaint received by the NAB in liquor case alleged that a bribe of Rs70 million was given for the issuance of liquor licence.
 The NAB official said the licence was issued for six months but was cancelled a few days before its expiry to give the licensee the opportunity to get a stay order from the court. Consequently, the NAB official claimed, the licence period remains unending.
 The NAB sources admit that there is nothing in the official file against the chief minister, but the role of the Excise and Taxation (E&T;) Punjab Director General Akram Ashraf Gondal, who has become a NAB approver against the chief minister, is quite clear.
 In a recent story published in The News, senior journalist Tariq Butt had reported, “There is nothing in black and white demonstrating involvement of Punjab Chief Minister Usman Buzdar in the issuance of liquor licence to a private hotel of Lahore for which he has been quizzed by the NAB.”
 Quoting official documents, it was reported that the official file makes it clear that Excise and Taxation (E&T;) Punjab Director General Akram Ashraf Gondal, who has become a NAB approver against the chief minister, kept involving Buzdar through his principal secretary and Punjab chief secretary by sending summaries for approval/information of the chief minister. “While as is clear from official papers that the chief minister kept distancing himself from the summaries by not bringing anything in writing, the approver has told the NAB that he was called for half a dozen times by Buzdar’s office and asked to issue the licence,” The News story read.
 The NAB sources, however, insist that in white-collar crime rarely the evidence is left on official files. These sources said that the Bureau has received several other complaints against the chief minister mostly about alleged corruption in government contracts. These complaints are presently in the complaint verification stage and different authorities have been approached for information required by the NAB. Meanwhile, a credible official source said those summoned in liquor case have also been questioned about certain other matters associated with Usman Buzdar and his chief ministership. “Some issues are grey while some are clearly black,” the source said, adding that NAB has got information about some matters that fall in the category of “black”.
 The Punjab chief minister has denied all such charges vehemently. He has also appeared before NAB. Talking to the media at the Lahore Chamber of Commerce & Industry, prior to appearing before NAB, Usman Buzdar had clarified that NAB did not summon him as an accused, but as a witness. He said he would answer all NAB questions. He said: “I am innocent; therefore, I am not afraid and I will satisfy NAB on all questions.”
 He said Prime Minister Imran Khan had always trusted him; therefore, he was holding the office as the Punjab chief minister. He said “my hands are clean.”

Former White House adviser Steve Bannon and three others were arrested and charged with defrauding donors of hundreds of thousands of dollars as part of a fundraising campaign that was supposed to support Trump's border wall. Bannon and defendant Brian Kolfage promised donors that the more than $25 million raised for the We Build the Wall campaign would go straight to the cause. Instead, prosecutors say Bannon and the others pocketed money to pay for their own lifestyle expenses. Bannon, the former head of Breitbart News, was an influential voice inside the White House as Trump's chief strategist until he was dismissed in August 2017. Released after a hearing yesterday, Bannon said the arrest was a fiasco to "stop people who want to build the wall." The President, meanwhile, claimed he didn't know the other people involved in the wall project, even though he has mentioned the group in tweets and other media.

Show business rejection didn't crush his protean spirit, though.

Instead of cooling his heels in the waiting room of some record label, hoping in vain for a producer to listen to his demo, Coulton put the song up on his Web site for anyone to give it a listen. It soon was reposted to Slashdot, a tech news site that's long been a watering hole for nerds on the Net, and the next thing you know, Coulton had morphed into Bruce Geeksteen.

When the coronavirus pandemic swept across the nation in the spring, Tony Curtis-Wellings, co-owner Faraday's Kitchen Store in Bee Cave, said he had to figure out how to shift his products and services to an online platform.


   


  The store hosts over 5,500 unique kitchen items, a cooking school and online retail shop. With in-store sales making up a majority of the store's income and about 25% stemming from cooking school classes, Curtis-Wellings said he and his staff refocused their efforts to keep things going virtually by moving classes to Zoom, adding more merchandise to the website and making curbside pick up available.


   


  "I said at the beginning I was not going to lay anyone off," he said. "So we refocused some of the team to be webmasters, working to make our kids cooking summer camp virtual and expanding our online store."


   


  But shifting the business model was just one part of the store's ability to weather the storm the pandemic has wrought upon the economy. With the help of the Bee Cave Small Business Assistance Center, Curtis-Wellings said he applied for and was awarded a $15,000 grant, which helped pay off the deferred rent payment the landlord allowed, through Bee Cave's business support program.


   


  "It gave us strength to move forward," he said. "We have truly repositioned the businesses and we are still in the process of doing so. But I think we are set up to ride this thing out."


   


  Faraday's is one of over 30 businesses that have benefited from grants from the business support program. The city launched a small business assistance center in April to help local business owners navigate disaster relief programs and other measures as a result of lost revenue due to the coronavirus.


   


  Bee Cave's Economic Development Board wanted to add to the relief efforts, by offering financial assistance to small businesses, another avenue of hope for businesses that have been impacted by a loss of revenue during the coronavirus pandemic. The board allocated $2 million toward the Bee Cave Business Support Program.


   


  Steve Albert, president of the board, said the majority of businesses are locally owned and the hope is these places will be around to contribute to the city in the future.


   


  "We are all in this together and want to help everyone but we can only do so much," Albert said.


   


  The economic development board traditionally reserves its money for projects and improvements around the city, such as park connectivity trails, but with upheaval of COVID-19, Albert said the board defined a new project to help businesses in the area.


   


  Each business has to provide proof of how the funds are spent from rent payments to renovations, personal protective equipment or paying salaries. And Albert said what has been great about the whole thing is seeing businesses get innovative and adjust business models that he says will hopefully still exist even after the pandemic is over.


   


  Curtis-Wellings said his business model shift has allowed him to expand his online presence. Customers can now purchase most products online, which can be shipped or picked up curbside. He said the virtual cooking classes have also allowed the school to expand beyond the greater Austin area.


   


  "I think we could come back and be better than what we were before," he said. "People sign up all over the country for online cooking classes. We are expanding our online presence and figuring out how to do classes online so that post-COVID we will be stronger and more profitable. I am giddy that we are getting through this and that we can take advantage of these new changes even after this all ends."


   


  Christie Garbe, owner of health and wellness center Serasana Bee Cave, said the studio took a hit when the pandemic began. Offering yoga classes, massage, acupuncture and facials, she said those services often require close and personal interaction, and under Gov. Greg Abbott orders were required to shut down.


   


  But with folks working from home and experiencing stress and fatigue, she said health and wellness services became more important than ever and that is when she began to pivot some of the services.


   


  Serasana offers nearly 30 yoga classes in the studio, and she said those were moved online. She said the studio also offers a free meditation class on YouTube once a week. She hopes to offer some small classes in person after Labor Day and is brainstorming some outdoor yoga for the fall. Her plan is to continue to offer online and outdoor classes in addition to traditional classes even when the pandemic ends.


   


  In-person services such as massages, acupuncture and facials have resumed, and she said the studio has implemented all the recommended safety protocols, including screening every client and staff member thoroughly, requiring facial coverings at all times and enhancing hygiene and cleaning protocols.


   


  "For those services that require touch the only thing we can do is follow restrictive safety protocols to make everyone feel safe," Garbe said. "All of our services can be delivered safely and comfortably, and I am ready to serve the community."


   


  Just outside the Live Music Capital of the World, Bee Cave's Musicians Woodshed has also suffered a 35% loss of business.


   


  The school employs 40 music teachers offering 700 lessons each week for numerous instruments including piano, violin and guitar. Since shuttering in June, Meredith Looney, director of operations of Musicians Woodshed, said the school has moved all lessons online, and the number of weekly lessons is down to 450.


   


  "Online is not the same as in person when you are taking music lessons," she said. "Kids need to see and feel what it's like with their fingers on the keys or stings. It just is not the same, so we are really hoping we can get back to in person lessons soon."


   


  Still, Looney noted that online classes have worked for some students and that she plans to continue offering that option even when the music studio reopens. She said a new flute teacher has joined staff and will be teaching virtually. Other music teachers will also be encouraged to teach both online and in-person.


   


  "We are hoping this will be one positive thing is that we will have a new revenue stream when this is all over," Looney said. "While they don't work for certain people, they are wonderful for others. Some people really enjoy that. Hopefully we can expand our geographical market this way."


   


  To date, the program has granted more than $500,000 to over 30 local businesses, Albert said, and as many local businesses continue to struggle applications remain open.


   


  "In my 30 years of business, I have never had anyone give us money," Curtis- Wellings said. "We are very grateful for what the city did. For the city to step up and show this type of thoughtfulness to the business community is just amazing. We're all in this together, and we've got to get to that point if we are going to get through it."

In June of 2019, jurors in a Brooklyn courthouse heard about D.O.S., a secret all-female society within Nxivm where sharing blackmail-worthy secrets and getting branded with Raniere’s initials were the price of admission, and having sex with him was the ultimate reward.
 The jurors heard about starvation diets, master-and-slave relationships and physical punishments for breaking the D.O.S.’ many rules. And at the end of the six-week trial, the jury took less than half a day to find Raniere guilty of multiple counts of racketeering and sex trafficking. He will be sentenced on Oct. 27.
 But how did this happen? How did Raniere — whose pre-Nxivm experience involved a company that was investigated for being a suspected pyramid scheme — manage to persuade so many intelligent, ambitious people to buy into what he was selling? Why were they OK with enlightenment being tied to just one more expensive seminar? Or to the recruitment of other seekers? Or to a relationship where you had to text your master before you were allowed to eat?
 It’s a slippery slope, this journey that starts with signing up for the official-sounding Executive Success Program and ends with enslavement. And one of the best decisions filmmakers Jehane Noujaim and Karim Amer (“The Great Hack,” “The Square”) made was in their choice of Sarah Edmondson and Mark Vicente to lead your tour down the Nxivm rabbit hole.

The Ministry of Finance high-ups briefed a selected group of reporters to convince that the cost of borrowing (difference between offered rates on bonds such as PIBs and policy rate) was 4.1 percent higher by end June 2018 that was brought down to 1.2 percent in fiscal year 2019 and fiscal year 2020.
 They were of the view that the higher cost of borrowing increased incentives for bankers because they invested into short-term debt by offering rate at their dictates knowingly that the government had become desperate borrower.
 Special Secretary Finance Mohsin Mushtaq Chandna and Director Debt Office Ministry of Finance Omar Zahid briefed reporters on Thursday and said that average time of maturity of domestic debt was improved substantially as under the IMF programme the borrowing from the State Bank of Pakistan retired on one hand to the tune of Rs570 billion in last fiscal year 2019-20 and Rs285 billion in July 2020, but the short-term debt profiling was also shifted from three and six months to over 12 months maturity period.
 So the short-term debt maturity was improved from 75 to 50 percent despite higher financing needs and imposition of ban on borrowing from the central bank under the IMF programme conditions.
 They also mentioned that the borrowing from the SBP increased manifold when Islamabad was not under the IMF programme as it became standalone in 2019 just ahead of the IMF programme. The government borrowed more money from the SBP for creation of buffer but it was good move because it helped the government avoid getting dictations from the bankers. They defended the government move to raise Rs22 billion through domestic bond and dispelled the impression that the government offered higher rates on domestic bond. They were of the view that the government re-introduced 15 years maturity bond as it was issued last time in 2011. So it was again introduced. They said that the spread on issuance of domestic bond stood at 4.1 percent during the period from 2013 to 2017-18 despite this fact that the policy rate was on lower side. Now the policy rate was on higher side, but the spread gap reduced significantly so they claimed that the debt management was done through hiring of professionals.

Gnabry’s improvement is visible from a year ago, when he was scoreless in the Champions League and couldn’t help Bayern avoid elimination by Liverpool in the round of 16. This season he has scored a goal in every three shots he took, and has created nearly two chances per game on average, according to statistical analysts Driblab. He has also become one of the team’s leaders in recoveries, with almost five per game.


  Di María scored three goals but was a lot more effective then Gnabry creating chances, with an average of almost three per game in his eight matches with PSG. He also thrived setting up his teammates, with an average of almost one assist per game. Di María didn’t play in the quarterfinals against Atalanta because of a suspension.


  What both players have in common is that they will be playing for the title after having their careers stalled in England — Di María while with Manchester United and Gnabry with Arsenal and West Bromwich Albion.


  Di María was United’s record signing when he joined from Real Madrid in 2014, but was unable to live up to the fee of 59.7 million pounds (then $99 million). Manager Louis van Gaal couldn’t work out how to get the best out of Di Maria, deploying him in central midfield and on the left wing as the team finished fourth in the Premier League. Di María and his family were also shaken by an attempted burglary before leaving England for Paris in 2015 after less than a year in Manchester.

With their showbiz poise and their insider knowledge, Vicente and Edmondson make great narrators. But their stories of being saved by Nxivm only to be betrayed by it are retold multiple times by other former members whose experiences follow the same disturbing pattern. And with each retelling, we get more footage of Raniere playing volleyball and pontificating, more recorded phone calls and conversations with Raniere talking a lot but not saying much of anything, and you find yourself thinking, “Him? They turned their lives over to him?”
 If there is a vacuum in these initial episodes of “The Vow” where the villain is supposed to be, there is more than enough personality and power in his victims to keep you invested in their well-being. I still don’t know what made Raniere and his philosophical mishmash so special, but I believe that Edmondson, Vicente and all of the other beautiful people believed it. And watching Raniere systematically exploit that belief to serve his needs is both heartbreaking and infuriating.
 Keith Raniere did not deserve their devotion, and they did not deserve his bland brand of evil. Some of the messages in “The Vow” get lost in the hot air, but that’s not one of them.

 Imran maintained that the issue of foreclosure laws was being effectively pursued and directed the banks to make applications for construction of houses easy and convenient so that the low and middle-income people could avail themselves of this facility to the maximum.
 Expressing satisfaction over the commitment of banks to play a dynamic role in the construction sector, the prime minister said construction sector guaranteed economic growth adding that the development of construction sector would create a number of lucrative business opportunities for the banks.
 Briefing the participants on the progress made by the banks in the field of construction with regard to easy disbursement of loans and funds, the president of Pakistan Banks Association said favorable policies and facilitation of the government had encouraged the private banks.
 “All banks are committed to promoting construction, especially for the low- income and middle-income people,” he said.
 Presidents of Bank of Punjab and Bank Al-Falah gave a briefing on the products to be introduced for promotion of housing construction under the New Pakistan Housing Programme.
 The presidents of other banks informed the prime minister that products had been developed by the banks for promotion of construction, which would be introduced soon.
 Meanwhile, Advisor on Parliamentary Affairs Babar Awan called on prime minister and held consultations on various constitutional, political, and legal matters.
 He also presented the new parliamentary calendar of PTI government’s third year to the prime minister.
 Meantime, the prime minister also called for paying special attention to automation in tax assessment, collection, and refund system.
 He was chairing a review meeting on the ongoing reforms in the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) here.
 Minister for Industries Muhammad Hammad Azhar, Minister for Information Senator Shibli Faraz, Minister for Planning Asad Umar, Finance Advisor Dr Abdul Hafeez Sheikh, Trade Adviser Abdul Razak Dawood, Advisor on Institutional Reforms Dr Ishrat Hussain, Special Assistant on Information Lt Gen (R) Asim Saleem Bajwa and other senior officers participated in the meeting.
 The chairman FBR briefed the prime minister on the ongoing reforms in the Board and the progress made so far. The reforms are aimed at ensuring transparency in the organization, simplifying the tax system, introducing automation, increasing the tax base and ensuring every possible facility for the business community, says a statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) here.
 Imran said promotion of tax culture in the country, creation of facilities for taxpayers, removal of reservations of business community and cleansing the FBR of corrupt elements were the top priorities of the government.
 He said special attention should be paid to automation in the system of tax assessment, collection, and refunds. In this regard, he directed that the tax form should be simplified on priority basis for individuals, companies, and especially small and medium enterprises.
 Regarding the ongoing reforms in various sectors of the FBR, the prime minister directed that timelines be set for achieving the targets as well as setting progress targets on them.
 Emphasizing the importance of effective measures to curb cross-border smuggling, the prime minister directed the FBR to make arrangements for effective surveillance of all crossing points along the border.
 Meanwhile, in another step to facilitate the expatriate Pakistanis, Imran approved the launch of Roshan Digital Account for overseas Pakistanis.
 The initiative has been taken on the instructions of Prime Minister Imran Khan.
 In a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Imran Khan, a briefing was given on Roshan Digital Account and the facilities available under it.
 The State Bank of Pakistan is introducing Roshan Digital Account in collaboration with eight major banks. Roshan Digital Account will be launched in the first week of September.
 Under this move, Pakistanis living abroad will be able to open their account in any bank of the country easily and in minutes while various facilities including remittances, bill payment, and investment will be easily available.
 Gilani appreciated the efforts of governor SBP and the participating private banks in introducing the Roshan Digital Account to facilitate Pakistanis abroad and said Pakistanis abroad were the most valuable asset of the country.
 “Providing all possible facilities to these Pakistanis and their families who have contributed to the development of the country away from home is the top priority of the government,” he maintained.
 The prime minister is also set to launch Sehat Insaf Card for entire Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Friday (today) for providing health insurance cover of Rs1 million to all the families.
 Calling it a historic development in extending quality healthcare to the people, the Prime Minister’s Office said KP would be the first province where every family would be given health insurance.
 The card would entitle the beneficiary family to avail itself of medical treatment of up to Rs1 million in government, as well as private hospitals.
 Earlier, in the first phase, around 40 percent of KP families were availing themselves of the facility.
 In this regard, the prime minister Thursday congratulated the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government for giving universal health insurance coverage to all KP-domiciled citizens despite financial problems.
 In tweets, he said, “Congratulations to KP govt that despite financial problems they have taken a bold step of giving universal health insurance coverage of Rs1 mn per family to all KP-domiciled citizens. This is in line with our Founding Father’s vision for Pak & a first step towards welfare state”.
 “This policy is only prevalent in a few developed states & not in the USA. I feel proud of our KP govt for taking this lead & hope all other provinces will follow suit. We are moving to do the same at the federal level,” he added.

ARGUINEGUIN, Spain (AP) — Five more migrants have died while trying to reach the southern Canary Islands from west Africa, bringing to 20 the number of who lost their lives this week attempting to navigate perilous migration routes to Europe, Spanish authorities said Friday. Maritime rescuers and police patrols based in Spain picked up a total of 141 migrants in the Mediterranean Sea and Atlantic Ocean within 48 hours, the country's official maritime rescue service said. The rescue operations included a wooden boat located some 110 miles south of the Canaries archipelago with 12 survivors on board and four bodies. Two of the survivors were evacuated by helicopter and one of them later died at the hospital, according to the Spanish government’s delegation in the islands. The bodies of 15 other migrants who were found dead in another boat earlier in the week, some floating in sea water their vessel had taken on, were transported Thursday to Grand Canary Island. A plane spotted the boat as it searched for a missing boat that had left Mauritania on August 15 with around 40 people. It remains unclear if the boat that was located is the one reported missing. The route from western Africa to the Spanish islands in the Atlantic Ocean is notoriously dangerous, but in recent times it has increasingly attracted migrants wanting to reach European shores as authorities have cracked down on migrant boats setting out on Mediterranean routes . Without counting the latest new fatalities reported on Thursday and Friday, at least 190 migrants have died since the beginning of the year trying to reach the Canary Islands, according to the U.N. migration agency’s Missing Migrants project. More than 3,500 migrants have arrived on the archipelago so far in 2020, five times the figure...

It was pointed out that three issues in Pakistan enjoy a broad national consensus across the board above party lines including Kashmir, nuclear programme and CPEC and today’s Joint Consultation Mechanism (JCM) further cemented this consensus on CPEC.
 It was the crux of discussions held among the International Department of Communist Party of China, in collaboration with Pakistan-China Institute, organised the second conference of the CPEC Political Parties Joint Consultation Mechanism (JCM) on the theme of “Working Together to Promote Economic Development and Improve People’s Lives Through High-Quality CPEC Cooperation” here on Thursday.
 Both sides political parties viewed CPEC as a “game changer and a guarantor of a better tomorrow for Pakistan’s 220 million people”. It was attended by nine political parties including Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz), the Pakistan People’s Party, the Balochistan Awami Party, the National Party, the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam, the Awami National Party, the Jamaat-e-Islami, and Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party, as well as leading officials from relevant government departments and representatives from business community of the two countries.
 The first JCM was held in Beijing in March 2019 and this JCM has now emerged as the institutional mechanism between the CPC and Pakistani political parties for CPEC coordination and communication.
 This online conference of nine political parties representing both the government and the opposition was the first of its kind in Pakistan that agreed to preserve, protect and promote CPEC, above party lines, since they all view CPEC as a “game changer and a guarantor of a better tomorrow for Pakistan’s 220 million people”.
 President Arif Alvi, in a congratulatory message to the conference, termed CPEC as ‘an iconic project of the Belt & Road Initiative which will change the destiny of the region and promote regional connectivity’. He reaffirmed Pakistan’s strong support to One China policy and strongly opposed any foreign intervention in internal affairs of China with regard to Hong Kong and Taiwan. He also thanked China for supporting Pakistan on Kashmir issue.
 The conference was co-chaired from the Pakistani side by the Chairman Senate, Sadiq Sanjrani and from the Chinese side by Song Tao, Minister of the International Department of CPC who is a member of the Chinese Central leadership. The 3-hour long conference also had experts speaking on various issues.
 Song Tao, Minister of IDCPC in his keynote speech thanked the president of Pakistan Dr Arif Alvi for sending the congratulatory letter. While appreciating the consensus to take it forward. Party to party cooperation between China and Pakistan is increasing and CPEC is entering into a new era.
 Senator Sadiq Sanjrani, in his keynote address, credited China for promoting regional connectivity with its landmark Belt and Road Initiative and extended Pakistan’s support to President Xi Jinping’s vision of “shared prosperity” and “win-win” cooperation of which CPEC is the practical manifestation. While appreciating President Xi Jinping’s leadership which has fulfilled the promise of “ruling for the people”, he pointed towards the role of CPC in accomplishing the first centennial goal by 2021. Lastly, he affirmed that the Senate of Pakistan shall play a greater role in engaging the consensus of different parties and delivering the political support for more cooperation between the countries under the CPEC.
 Liu Qi, Leader of CPC Jiangxi Provincial Committee congratulated all the participants for the successful organization of the second JCM of political parties on CPEC. He said that the economic cooperation between Pakistan and China is important in high quality construction of CPEC. Moreover, he announced donation of 500,000 masked and 2000 Protective Personal Equipment (PPE) to Pakistani political parties.
 Saifullah Khan Nyazee, Chief Organizer of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, said that this conference is a great moment that shows that all political parties are on one platform when it comes to CPEC. He also appreciated the exemplary measures taken by China during the fight against pandemic. Moreover, he reaffirmed the commitment and confidence of PTI in taking CPEC forward.
 Senator Mushahid Hussain Sayed, from the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) and Chairman of Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs, who also is founding Chairman of PCI, congratulated China on successfully combating COVID-19 through timely measures, decisive leadership and a governance system based on excellent health care facilities as well as a people centered approach and thanked China for its support to Pakistan during the COVID-19 crisis. He said that there are three issues in Pakistan which enjoy a broad national consensus across the board above party lines and these are Kashmir, nuclear programme and CPEC and today’s JCM cemented this consensus on CPEC amongst political parties of Pakistan.
 Moreover, he said that CPEC remains uninterrupted despite the pandemic and is connecting the less developed parts of Pakistan through the Western route. It has activated Gwadar port as the hub of regional connectivity including Afghan transit trade and connectivity with Central Asia. Lastly, he said that Pakistan fully supports China in the defence of its territorial integrity and sovereignty, rejects politicising of the pandemic, appreciates China’s positive role, and rejects the notion of a new cold war. Both countries support each other’s core interests and he referred to the presence in China today of a high level civil-military delegation led by the foreign minister.
 Sherry Rehman, Vice President of the Pakistan People’s Party and Chairperson of Senate Committee on CPEC said that CPEC is the poster child of BRI and is the economic stabiliser for Pakistan. She reiterated PPP’s support to CPEC and PPP is invested in the “Chinese dream”. Pakistan believes in China’s sovereign right to develop and stays firm to One-China policy. Moreover, she said that Pakistan and China share an outstanding history of cooperation. Lastly, she appreciated China for emerging as a world leader in the current crisis.
 Amanullah Khan Yasinzai, Governor of Balochistan, said that the year 2020 is rough and tough and China has emerged as a key player in world politics and economy. China and Pakistan are all weather friends and strategic partners and Pakistan was the first country to send medical aid to China when it was fighting COVID pandemic. Moreover, he said that western media shows its double standards when it comes to reporting of Xinjiang issue. He said that people in Xinjiang are reaping the benefits of China’s development. Moreover, he said that Balochistan is an important link of CPEC and Gwadar port will help in connecting Pakistan with Afghanistan and Central Asian countries.
 Yao Jing, Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan, said that he is happy to see the COVID cases in Pakistan getting lower day by day. The resilient nature of Pakistan-China friendship and CPEC can be gauged from the fact that it survived even the COVID pandemic and has become stronger. Moreover, he said that China will always stand side by side with Pakistan in all areas of cooperation and both countries will fight the challenges like COVID together.
 At the end of the conference, a joint statement was adopted unanimously by all the participants, criticised the ‘slander’ against CPEC and said the JCM would maintain ‘strategic communication’ and build consensus amongst political parties.

He gave these directions while chairing a weekly meeting of the National Coordination Committee for Housing, Construction, and Development here. Information Minister Senator Shibli Faraz, Special Assistants Malik Amin Aslam, Lt Gen (R) Asim Saleem Bajwa, Syed Zulfiqar Abbas Bukhari, Dr Shahbaz Gul, Governor SBP Dr Reza Baqir, Chairman New Pakistan Housing Authority Lt Gen (retd) Anwar Ali Haider, and presidents of all the major banks attended the meeting.
 Imran maintained that the issue of foreclosure laws was being effectively pursued and directed the banks to make applications for construction of houses easy and convenient so that the low and middle-income people could avail themselves of this facility to the maximum.
 Expressing satisfaction over the commitment of banks to play a dynamic role in the construction sector, the prime minister said construction sector guaranteed economic growth adding that the development of construction sector would create a number of lucrative business opportunities for the banks.
 Briefing the participants on the progress made by the banks in the field of construction with regard to easy disbursement of loans and funds, the president of Pakistan Banks Association said favorable policies and facilitation of the government had encouraged the private banks.
 “All banks are committed to promoting construction, especially for the low- income and middle-income people,” he said. Presidents of Bank of Punjab and Bank Al-Falah gave a briefing on the products to be introduced for promotion of housing construction under the New Pakistan Housing Programme.
 The presidents of other banks informed the prime minister that products had been developed by the banks for promotion of construction, which would be introduced soon. Meanwhile, Advisor on Parliamentary Affairs Babar Awan called on prime minister and held consultations on various constitutional, political, and legal matters.
 He also presented the new parliamentary calendar of PTI government’s third year to the prime minister. Meantime, the prime minister also called for paying special attention to automation in tax assessment, collection, and refund system.
 He was chairing a review meeting on the ongoing reforms in the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) here. Minister for Industries Muhammad Hammad Azhar, Minister for Information Senator Shibli Faraz, Minister for Planning Asad Umar, Finance Advisor Dr Abdul Hafeez Sheikh, Trade Adviser Abdul Razak Dawood, Advisor on Institutional Reforms Dr Ishrat Hussain, Special Assistant on Information Lt Gen (R) Asim Saleem Bajwa and other senior officers participated in the meeting.
 The chairman FBR briefed the prime minister on the ongoing reforms in the Board and the progress made so far. The reforms are aimed at ensuring transparency in the organization, simplifying the tax system, introducing automation, increasing the tax base and ensuring every possible facility for the business community, says a statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) here.
 Imran said promotion of tax culture in the country, creation of facilities for taxpayers, removal of reservations of business community and cleansing the FBR of corrupt elements were the top priorities of the government.
 He said special attention should be paid to automation in the system of tax assessment, collection, and refunds. In this regard, he directed that the tax form should be simplified on priority basis for individuals, companies, and especially small and medium enterprises.
 Regarding the ongoing reforms in various sectors of the FBR, the prime minister directed that timelines be set for achieving the targets as well as setting progress targets on them. Emphasizing the importance of effective measures to curb cross-border smuggling, the prime minister directed the FBR to make arrangements for effective surveillance of all crossing points along the border.
 Meanwhile, in another step to facilitate the expatriate Pakistanis, Imran approved the launch of Roshan Digital Account for overseas Pakistanis. The initiative has been taken on the instructions of Prime Minister Imran Khan.
 In a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Imran Khan, a briefing was given on Roshan Digital Account and the facilities available under it. The State Bank of Pakistan is introducing Roshan Digital Account in collaboration with eight major banks. Roshan Digital Account will be launched in the first week of September.
 Under this move, Pakistanis living abroad will be able to open their account in any bank of the country easily and in minutes while various facilities including remittances, bill payment, and investment will be easily available.
 Gilani appreciated the efforts of governor SBP and the participating private banks in introducing the Roshan Digital Account to facilitate Pakistanis abroad and said Pakistanis abroad were the most valuable asset of the country.
 “Providing all possible facilities to these Pakistanis and their families who have contributed to the development of the country away from home is the top priority of the government,” he maintained.
 The prime minister is also set to launch Sehat Insaf Card for entire Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Friday (today) for providing health insurance cover of Rs1 million to all the families. Calling it a historic development in extending quality healthcare to the people, the Prime Minister’s Office said KP would be the first province where every family would be given health insurance.
 The card would entitle the beneficiary family to avail itself of medical treatment of up to Rs1 million in government, as well as private hospitals. Earlier, in the first phase, around 40 percent of KP families were availing themselves of the facility.
 In this regard, the prime minister Thursday congratulated the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government for giving universal health insurance coverage to all KP-domiciled citizens despite financial problems.
 In tweets, he said, “Congratulations to KP govt that despite financial problems they have taken a bold step of giving universal health insurance coverage of Rs1 mn per family to all KP-domiciled citizens. This is in line with our Founding Father's vision for Pak & a first step towards welfare state”.
 “This policy is only prevalent in a few developed states & not in the USA. I feel proud of our KP govt for taking this lead & hope all other provinces will follow suit. We are moving to do the same at the federal level,” he added.

“Different development authorities, which regulate the housing schemes, have different bylaws,” an official told The News, and stressed that uniformity of bylaws was necessitated. He said the government had decided to put in place a uniform policy for the private housing schemes to be followed by the development authorities but its issuance was facing delay.
 The prime minister’s construction package became effective from April 17, 2020 and will last till Dec 31, 2020. The relevant ordinance says a construction or development project, which commenced between April 17, 2020 and Dec 31, 2020 and completed before 30th September 2020 is covered by package.
 The revised Punjab Private Housing Schemes and Land Sub-Division Rules 2020 to be implemented by the development authorities have not so far been issued with the builders and development authorities awaiting them. The delay in adoption of the uniform policy by the development authorities is a major discouraging factor for the builders, which will result in reduction of tax collection, an industry official said.
 A Punjab government official said a decision had been taken to implement the Private Housing Schemes and Land Sub-Division Rules 2020 of the Lahore Development Authority (LDA), which had been revised and improved, on all other development authorities including Rawalpindi Development Authority (RDA), Faisalabad Development Authority (FDA), Gujranwala Development Authority (GDA), Multan Development Authority (MDA) etc., to achieve uniformity throughout Punjab.
 He said letters were being written to the RDA, FDA, DGA and MDA to seek their consent and input to adoption of the LDA bylaws by them to ensure uniformity. Official record shows that early this year, the development authorities wrote letters to the Housing, Urban Development & Public Health Engineering (HUD&PHE;) Department secretary of Punjab giving their consent to the adoption of the LDA rules on private housing schemes.
 However, later the LDA rules were somewhat amended after the approval of the cabinet. The HUD&PHE; is sending the amended LDA policy for the private housing schemes to all the development authorities seeking their consent in black and white for its adoption. Approval of the cabinet would be got for issuance of the notification of the uniform policy only after the authorities would communicate their consent to the LDA rules.
 The industry source said that the approved LDA rules, which the government has decided to be adopted by all other development authorities, encapsulate positives clauses for the private housing schemes.
 For instance, the rules have increased the commercial area of housing societies by 5%, making it 10% in total. They have permitted the buildings to be “mix commercial”, meaning a multi-storey residential plaza is allowed to have one floor for commercial purposes.
 The industry official said that another good rule provides for revision in the plan of an approved housing scheme meaning that the sites earmarked for public amenities can be changed, but open spaces shall not be shifted to a different location in the revised layout plan, except if no plots have been sold in the scheme; or the sponsor has furnished no objection certificates from the buyers of sold plots facing the open space required to be changed after issuance of public notice specifying proposed changes.
 However, he said a discouraging measure for the builders has also been introduced – the DC (district collector) rate has been enhanced up to 15 percent. At the time of registry of the land, the purchaser is required to pay a huge amount as duty as per the increased DC rate.
 As a whole, the construction industry has hailed the package laden with incentives, concessions and facilities. It introduces the Fixed Tax Regime (FTR) on income and sales tax for the builders. No inquiries will be made by the government about the source of investment made in the real estate sector; sales tax on construction companies giving services to builders registered with the provincial revenue authority will be at zero tax basis, which was 16% previously; and holding period of immovable property and its rate of tax on capital gain, which came down from eight years to four years, has been reduced.

 SPRINGWATER -- A Monroe County resident has been arrested on felony charges after an investigation into an ATV crash the early morning hours of July 4, Livingston County Sheriff Thomas J. Dougherty said Thursday.
 On July 4, at approximately 2:25 a.m., Sheriff's Deputies and Emergency Personnel responded to Miller Road in the Town of Springwater for the report of an ATV crash that had just occurred. Responding emergency units found the operator of the ATV in the roadway with serious injuries.
 The operator of the ATV was identified as Donald J. Boykin Jr., 35, from Brockport.
 Boykin was transported to Strong Memorial Hospital by Mercy Flight for treatment of his injuries which included a traumatic head injury. Investigating Deputy Sheriffs suspected that Boykin was under the influence of alcohol. A records check also revealed that Boykin had a revoked driver's license due to a previous DWI related conviction on Nov. 16, 2015.
 Deputy Justin Hilt responded to Strong Hospital to conduct a DWI investigation which included obtaining a blood sample to test Boykin's blood alcohol content (BAC). The blood was sent to a forensic lab for testing.
 On Aug. 18, Boykin was arrested and charged with felony Driving While Intoxicated, felony Aggravated Unlicensed Operation of a Motor Vehicle in the first degree along with violations of the NYS Vehicle and Traffic Law after lab results showed that Boykin had a BAC of .15%. The DWI and AUO charges were felonies due to Boykin's previous DWI related conviction in 2015.
 Boykin was turned over to Central Booking Deputies at the Livingston County Jail for processing and released on appearance tickets as the offenses did not qualify for pre-arraignment detention under the NYS Justice Reform Act. Boykin will answer to the charges at a later date in the Town of Springwater Court.
 Also assisting with the investigation from the Sheriff's Office was Investigator Connor Sanford, Sergeant Chad Draper, Deputy Menzo Peck, Deputy Mike Wade, and Sergeant Chad VanAuken from the Forensic Identification Unit.

The California Republican Party has been in a downward spiral for years and Faulconer was one of the few bright lights. Early polls had him running second behind Newsom for the open governor’s seat in 2018.
 Faulconer said he was only focused on being mayor, but speculation continued as he raised his statewide profile. He gave speeches aimed at pushing the California GOP toward a more pragmatic, less ideological approach to governing and away from the national Republican Party.
 Even with that, a bid for governor may have been a long shot, not just because of Newsom’s overwhelming advantage in the deep blue state, but some of Faulconer’s positions would have come under fire from conservative Republicans.
 Then, festering homelessness in San Diego exploded into a hepatitis A crisis that killed 20 people and put hundreds in the hospital. That certainly put an end to his prospects for 2018.

Genevieve, which had been a powerful Category 4 hurricane with winds of 130 mph (215 kph) on Tuesday, had weakened to a tropical storm Thursday as it moved northwestward in the Pacific off Mexico's Los Cabos tourist resorts. The hurricane center said the storm was expected to continue weakening through the night, likely becoming a tropical depression by Friday evening.
 The hurricane center said Genevieve’s maximum sustained winds had dropped to 50 mph (85 kph) Friday morning, and it was centered about 130 miles (210 kilometers) west-southwest of Cabo San Lazaro. It was moving to the west- northwest at 10 mph (17 kph).
 The storm knocked out power and phone service to a large part of the Los Cabos area, flooded streets in poor neighborhoods and toppled palms in the tourist zone. High surf claimed two lives Tuesday as the storm approached the area.
 Baja California Sur state officials said 15,000 foreign tourists were in the state, most in the Los Cabos region, which earlier had almost been emptied of visitors by pandemic restrictions.

 He said as many as 21 complaints were received in written form to which more than Rs1.1 million relief was granted to the complainants. Around Rs1, 724,000 payments were ensured against 407 complaints received through Prime Minister’s Performance Delivery Unit (PMDU), he added.

The major downside to the Bullitt is that it's an $8,000 upcharge over a Mustang GT Premium. The as-tested price on my example is $52,595, including $1,095 for destination. And since the Bullitt only gets 14 miles per gallon city, 23 mpg highway and 17 mpg combined, there's a $1,000 gas guzzler tax added on.


  The Mustang isn't the only muscular sport coupe around, either. I've always been a fan of the Dodge Challenger R/T Scat Pack Widebody, though it kind of drives like a boat. The Chevrolet Camaro offers a 6.2-liter V8 engine with Bullitt levels of power, and in the immortal words of The Dead Milkmen, is totally bitchin'.


  Ford also offers sportier Mustangs, don't forget: the Shelby GT350 and GT500. Both are more expensive, but they're far better in terms of handling and offer more power, to boot. But they're also different cars for different purposes. And the Bullitt is just so cool.


  Everything from the Bullitt's green paint to the snazzy wheels to the rumbling exhaust pays homage to the Mustang's movie-car heritage and its iconic place in American culture. It might not be the quickest, best-handling Mustang, but it's easily my favorite.

Over the past decade, North County restaurant owners Roddy and Aaron Browning have looked upon Yelp, the high-profile crowd-sourced reviews platform, as something of a necessary evil. A diner’s positive 5-star review will make their day, but a negative 1- or 2-star review will ruin their week.
 But since the pandemic began in March, the Brownings and many other local restaurateurs say recent bad reviews on Yelp — many of them for county-ordered safety and service requirements beyond their control — are making the struggle to survive even harder. Some owners’ classy, clever and angry written responses to recent low-starred reviews have gone viral.
 Meanwhile, Yelp says it has stepped up efforts to remove unfair reviews and it is encouraging its diner-members to show compassion for restaurant owners before they push the publish button.
 The Brownings own 10-year-old The Flying Pig Pub & Kitchen in Oceanside and 5-year-old TownHall Public House in Vista. For them, the struggle to keep the doors open is a real and daily battle. Sales are down 60 percent at both locations, and recent low-starred Yelp reviews have hurt business. One diner complained about the Flying Pig’s phone being busy due to a rise in takeout orders. Another said his pork chop wasn’t piping hot when it reached the table. And a third was unhappy with their table on the patio at TownHall. Roddy Browning said his efforts to have Yelp remove the most unfair and dishonest reviews has been unsuccessful.

Further, Howard is the Phillies’ top pitching prospect, a 24-year-old right- hander with a mid-90s fastball, a bat-slowing change-up, an emerging slider and vast potential. At some point, he will need to learn to pitch through a two-on, one-out spot early in a game.


  If this season is going to slip away, let it be because the Phillies did things like leaving the ball in Howard’s hands and letting him sink or swim.


  Otherwise, Thursday represented what Howard characterized as “a step in the right direction.”


  After giving up four homers in his first two starts and exiting early from his previous start with a blister on his right middle finger, Howard had more life on his fastball (95.1-m.p.h. average velocity, 97-m.p.h. peak) and got 10 swings and misses, eight on his heater.

“Different development authorities, which regulate the housing schemes, have different bylaws,” an official told The News, and stressed that uniformity of bylaws was necessitated.
 He said the government had decided to put in place a uniform policy for the private housing schemes to be followed by the development authorities but its issuance was facing delay.
 The prime minister’s construction package became effective from April 17, 2020 and will last till Dec 31, 2020. The relevant ordinance says a construction or development project, which commenced between April 17, 2020 and Dec 31, 2020 and completed before 30th September 2020 is covered by package.
 The revised Punjab Private Housing Schemes and Land Sub-Division Rules 2020 to be implemented by the development authorities have not so far been issued with the builders and development authorities awaiting them. The delay in adoption of the uniform policy by the development authorities is a major discouraging factor for the builders, which will result in reduction of tax collection, an industry official said.
 A Punjab government official said a decision had been taken to implement the Private Housing Schemes and Land Sub-Division Rules 2020 of the Lahore Development Authority (LDA), which had been revised and improved, on all other development authorities including Rawalpindi Development Authority (RDA), Faisalabad Development Authority (FDA), Gujranwala Development Authority (GDA), Multan Development Authority (MDA) etc., to achieve uniformity throughout Punjab.
 He said letters were being written to the RDA, FDA, DGA and MDA to seek their consent and input to adoption of the LDA bylaws by them to ensure uniformity.
 Official record shows that early this year, the development authorities wrote letters to the Housing, Urban Development & Public Health Engineering (HUD&PHE;) Department secretary of Punjab giving their consent to the adoption of the LDA rules on private housing schemes.
 However, later the LDA rules were somewhat amended after the approval of the cabinet. The HUD&PHE; is sending the amended LDA policy for the private housing schemes to all the development authorities seeking their consent in black and white for its adoption. Approval of the cabinet would be got for issuance of the notification of the uniform policy only after the authorities would communicate their consent to the LDA rules.
 The industry source said that the approved LDA rules, which the government has decided to be adopted by all other development authorities, encapsulate positives clauses for the private housing schemes.
 For instance, the rules have increased the commercial area of housing societies by 5%, making it 10% in total. They have permitted the buildings to be “mix commercial”, meaning a multi-storey residential plaza is allowed to have one floor for commercial purposes.
 The industry official said that another good rule provides for revision in the plan of an approved housing scheme meaning that the sites earmarked for public amenities can be changed, but open spaces shall not be shifted to a different location in the revised layout plan, except if no plots have been sold in the scheme; or the sponsor has furnished no objection certificates from the buyers of sold plots facing the open space required to be changed after issuance of public notice specifying proposed changes.
 However, he said a discouraging measure for the builders has also been introduced – the DC (district collector) rate has been enhanced up to 15 percent. At the time of registry of the land, the purchaser is required to pay a huge amount as duty as per the increased DC rate.
 As a whole, the construction industry has hailed the package laden with incentives, concessions and facilities. It introduces the Fixed Tax Regime (FTR) on income and sales tax for the builders. No inquiries will be made by the government about the source of investment made in the real estate sector; sales tax on construction companies giving services to builders registered with the provincial revenue authority will be at zero tax basis, which was 16% previously; and holding period of immovable property and its rate of tax on capital gain, which came down from eight years to four years, has been reduced.
