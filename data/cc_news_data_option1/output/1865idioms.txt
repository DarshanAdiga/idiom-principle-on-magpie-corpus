At press time, Moua planned to return to the Cities at the end of March for a meet-and-greet at a _Mulan_ screening. While in town, he was looking forward to hugging his family and letting his parents tell him, once more, what his life could be like if only he were a doctor. That world feels far away right now, and for more reasons than one, the actor feels tied to L.A. for the time being—after all, PoPo loves a good ocean breeze.

He knows he's not the fastest guy out there as far as foot speed turnover, but he's gutsy, gritty, consistent. He's learned how to sacrifice for the team.
 "He had a great season. What stood above everything else, we kind of flipped every thing on end this year. We talked more about sacrifices as seniors. I had them go last to some of our meals and had the freshmen go first. This senior group, led by Haddon, didn't bat an eye at it. ... There wasn't any complaint about 'I waited my four years and now I don't get a chance.' It was 'I have an opportunity and this is what Coach needs us to do, so that's what I'm going to do.'"

“Testing” usually refers to a testing by a school psychologist, an educational psychologist, or a neuropsychologist. School assessments are performed to see if a child qualifies for an individualized education program, or IEP. These tests focus on skills necessary for academic achievement. They don’t diagnose learning or behavioral disorders. Neuropsychological testing evaluates learning and behavior as it relates to a child’s brain. This kind of assessment is done when a child is showing difficulty in learning, attention, behavior, socialization, or emotional control. Sometimes a disease, trauma, concussion, or a developmental problem affects the brain, and testing can help identify how this impacts a child’s current function.

VIRUS OUTBREAK-KENTUCKYRallygoers sue Beshear; gov says rally sent message of hateFRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) — Gov. Andy Beshear has criticized organizers of protests taking aim at the pace of business reopenings in Kentucky. Beshear said Tuesday that the organizers risk spreading the coronavirus outbreak by flouting health guidelines. And he says they sent a “message of hate" with the display of Confederate flags at their rallies. His criticism comes as some protesters are suing him. They claim his pandemic measures are infringing on their right to protest at the state Capitol. The four men are asking a federal judge to strike down orders that keep protesters away from Capitol grounds.DERBY MERCHANDISE SALE-DONATIONSKentucky Derby Museum to donate proceeds to virus reliefLOUISVILLE, Ky.

The museum said Tuesday the donations will go towards Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear’s Team Kentucky Fund and the One Louisville COVID-19 Response Fund.

Since the COVID-19 outbreak, the focus on the supply chain has been greater than ever. Prior to this crisis, people drove to the grocery store confident that whatever they wanted would be on the shelf. Consumers didn’t need to think about the complex systems that enabled those products to be there — they just knew goods would be available.
 That changed in March, when shoppers began seeing empty shelves where toilet paper, hand sanitizer, paper towels, cleaning supplies and basic food products once sat. Panic buying as well as a radical shift in food stockpiling as restaurants closed across the country led to increased demand at grocery stores, putting new and sudden pressure on the supply chain.

The Associated Press article Tuesday about mental health needs for veterans needs to be expanded. Some of us are instinctively aware that after the last two months of this horrific pandemic, many Americans including veterans, will be facing mental health problems.
 As usual, these problems take a back seat to medical crises. Unfortunately, national, state and local leaders have not yet addressed the oncoming resurgence of drug and alcohol abuse, growing rates of suicide, how many have witnessed the sudden death of loved ones, the impact of unemployment as these issues affect our behavior and thinking. What is being done nationally, and locally to address these important mental health issues?
 We need to prepare for the resurgence of varying problems individuals will have just as we addressed the need for ventilators in hospitals and we were unable to obtain them. States have slashed much-needed funds to address drug addiction, mental health clinics, and the availability of mental health care providers including psychiatrists, psychologists, counselors and designated places where there are resources.
 Who is in charge of preparing for the effort to reach so many who will need extensive treatment and counseling? Have we learned anything from playing "catch-up" during this pandemic? It is urgent that we understand that now is the time to prepare for the onslaught of mental health problems that will be prominent when this horrendous period we have all suffered through ends.

After nearly two months of being closed due to the coronavirus, SoldierFit Frederick will start to offer outdoor classes next week, but limit them to 10 people per class.
 Gov. Larry Hogan initially included allowing gyms to hold outdoor classes in the first phase of the “Reopen Maryland” plan, which has yet to go into effect. But his order amendment on May 6 approved “outdoor fitness instruction” in addition to other activities like golf, tennis and fishing.
 While the change went into effect last Thursday, gyms such as SoldierFit and Frederick-based MAD Fitness waited so they could develop a plan to safely implement outdoor classes.
 Danny Farrar, co-owner of SoldierFit, said he took guidance from another fitness company and adapted it to make it work for his gym. SoldierFit released a plan on Facebook detailing each step of their process. They’ll have to wait for orders from Hogan to move past outdoor classes, but they already have several future safety measures in place.
 SoldierFit’s workouts usually consist of attendees moving between stations and using a variety of equipment. Since that would allow for easy cross- contamination, the gym will instead pivot to outdoor classes where each individual will stay in their own “bunker box.” Each box is a six-by-six foot barrier that will keep them at a distance from the other attendees.
 Similarly, MAD Fitness will hold their classes in the parking lot behind their facility, with each attendee keeping to their own parking space, co-owner Amy DiPasquale said. They will also stagger the attendees so nobody’s parking spaces are touching.
 Both Farrar and DiPasquale said they will disinfect all equipment both before and after each class, and have their instructors wear masks.
 Cleanliness is a top priority for both gym owners, long before the pandemic hit, they said. With the coronavirus pandemic, both are investing in even more cleaning equipment and following new guidelines.
 “So I’m taking a lot of measures so when phase two comes on board and people are allowed to come back in the gym,” DiPasquale said. “So that they know that we are taking every precautionary measure we have to keep their facility as clean as possible for them.”
 Like many independent gyms, both SoldierFit and MAD Fitness have transitioned to online workout classes. And while many of their members stayed on, they have definitely felt the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 “The first couple weeks that this hit... people I think were hopeful that it wasn’t going to last that long, so they held onto their membership,” DiPasquale said. “But I think after several weeks and they didn’t see any light at the end of the tunnel, it was difficult to do classes and be motivated. We saw a considerable drop off in memberships. And I get it.”
 Farrar estimates that he lost $120,000 in revenue last month alone. The lack of new members joining and personal training both contributed to that revenue loss.
 He sees the value of online training, but also knows that if people really preferred online workouts over going to a gym in person, gyms would have gone extinct a long time ago.
 “People require accountability,” Farrar said. “They require instruction.”
 However, he plans on keeping his online classes in place even after the state has completely reopened, because even people who do prefer to go to the gym regularly can benefit from online classes, when they’re either away from home or don’t have time to make it to a class.
 “So I personally believe … you will not be able to stay in business as a gym if the only thing you offer is in-person,” Farrar said. “I believe you’re going to have to offer both.”
 While their members have responded positively to the idea of the outdoor classes, both Farrar and DiPasquale are concerned about the future for the fitness industry. It’s uncertain how long each phase of the reopening process will take, and how many people will feel safe returning to gyms even once they’re open.
 “So the fear of the unknown and the what ifs are very concerning and scary,” DiPasquale said. “But as a small business owner, I have to keep marching on and keep trying to find a way to make it work.”

Jofra Archer Wants Cricket Matches to Resume Behind Closed Doors, Says 'It Will Be Difficult but Necessary'
   *[13 May]: 13 May 2020

When his team’s season was initially halted by the coronavirus pandemic, Mount St. Mary’s baseball coach Scott Thomson figured it would eventually resume.
 That hope faded when he learned the NBA had shut down its season. And shortly after that foreboding news broke, the NCAA canceled all spring sports.
 “And just like that, I had to contact everybody by phone, text message, email and just say, unfortunately, the season’s over,” he said. “It was crazy.”
 As Thomson said, something new always pops up, even for longtime coaches like him who seemingly have seen it all.
 But an abrupt end to his team’s 2020 season isn’t the only unprecedented situation Thomson had thrust on him by the health crisis.
 Recruiting players figures to be considerably more challenging for Thomson. Not only did the health crisis shut down the high school baseball season before it began, robbing him of a chance to see prospects in action, but it threatens to limit the amount of offseason activities that showcase potential recruits.
 Also, Division I coaches like Thomson could be affected by the NCAA’s decision to grant an extra year of eligibility to all student-athletes in spring sports whose seasons were canceled by the pandemic.
 Do current seniors or underclassmen plan to stay for a fifth year? If so, how do programs — particularly ones from small colleges like Mount St. Mary’s — accommodate such wishes while adding freshmen over the next few years?
 The pandemic-related shutdown of sports this spring will likely create ripple effects that will be felt for years to come by college athletic programs, and not just for spring teams or for Division I schools.
 Kenny Putnam, head coach of Hood College’s Division III men’s soccer team, says he never stops recruiting. But the health crisis disrupted his recruiting routine.
 “Normally, we spend our spring kind of out on the recruiting trails, finding players at games and talking to players that have contacted us while we’re out on the road at games,” he said. “But obviously right now, that’s not happening, unfortunately.”
 At least Putnam can see — even if it’s on film — radar-worthy prospects play as high school sophomores. Thomson has no such chance, creating a potential blind spot when trying to evaluate the skills of players from the class of 2022.
 “There’s no avenue for us to get out to see them right now,” Thomson said. “And to see them as a freshman, a year ago, I mean, at that time, a lot of them are 5-foot-8, 5-foot-10 and 135 pounds. So how are you supposed to make a decision on them at that time?”
 Showcase events in the summer and fall usually provide college coaches with chances to size up prospects. In fact, Thomson said several of them are held at Mount St. Mary’s facilities during the summer and fall. But it’s unclear if those — or any others throughout the country — will be held as planned at the Mount or anywhere else this year, thanks to the pandemic.
 “Without that, once again, there’s no way of seeing ’22s and ’23s, and that’s where it’s really going to hurt us,” Thomson said. “Not just us, but just hurt Division I and Division II sports, looking down the road.”
 Mount men’s lacrosse coach Tom Gravante said his recruiting efforts have been focused on athletes who will be rising seniors this summer, and he has insight into how such students have been affected by the pandemic.
 “I have a son who’s a junior at Georgetown Prep. He didn’t get to take an SAT. He was scheduled to take it, and it was canceled,” he said. “Many young men have the same situation, so it’s going to delay it.
 “But my approach at Mount St. Mary’s with my staff is, not to move forward quickly with these young men because it’s not fair to them,” he said. “I don’t believe in the early recruiting process.”
 Mount coaches also must deal with changes created by the NCAA Division I Council’s eligibility extension for athletes who saw their spring seasons canceled.
 The eligibility of all 2020 spring athletes, not just seniors, was extended. The Division I council allowed schools to expand their spring rosters beyond current scholarship limits and increased baseball’s 35-man roster limit, as long as the overage matched the amount of returning seniors.
 Seniors who return to a baseball team won’t count against the program’s 11.7 scholarships. But it’s up to coaches to choose how much money returning seniors get, as long as the amount doesn’t exceed scholarship money they had in 2020. Then they’ll have to decide on current underclassmen who want a fifth year.
 “It’s going to be up to us as coaches to kind of decide as these kids come through and it’s their senior year and they have one year left, do we grant them a fifth-year scholarship, are they going to want to stick around?” Thomson said.
 Budgetary limitations will likely play a large role in such decisions.
 “I know talking to a lot of other coaches, this is where a lot of us are upset — that we were just kind of hoping the NCAA would’ve just come out for Division I and said, ‘OK, this is what’s going to happen in the next four years.’ And then everybody abides by the same rules,” Thomson said. “And instead, it’s going to be up to each institution, and unfortunately, the rich are going to get richer and the poor are going to get poorer.”
 Family finances of athletes will likely influence how many opt for an extra year of eligibility. Unlike football or basketball, Division I spring sports don’t typically award full scholarships.
 And every athlete who decides to stay for a fifth year could mean less roster spots, less money or less playing time for incoming freshmen.
 “It may also decrease the amount of 2021s and 2022s that teams will recruit,” said Gravante, speaking generally about men’s lacrosse. “And it’s sad. [I’m] not really sure how some of these programs are going to approach it.”
 As for Gravante, he was just hoping to see rising seniors compete in events this summer. He said there are usually dead periods in July and August, but he thought the latter might have be lifted so coaches could evaluate prospects who missed the entire 2020 high school season.
 Hood softball coach Terry Burdette already lost out on one of his recruiting stops — high school playoff games, where he can see how players perform when stakes are high.
 Other evaluation opportunities for softball recruits are in flux. Burdette, who also coaches the 18U Gold Heartbreakers travel team, said one of the summer’s biggest recruiting events, held in Philadelphia, was moved to August.
 “Certainly the kids that are going to be rising seniors, it hurts us with them,” he said during an interview last month. “This summer, travel ball tournaments usually start around Memorial Day weekend and go through early August. And right now, those are all up in limbo.”
 These days, athletes can submit highlight reels to coaches and use technology to reach out to coaches. Last month, Burdette heard from some players.
 “They’re sophomores in high school that have emailed me and they’ve called me,” he said. “I have the time to talk to them for a half an hour. So it’s given us more time to check in with our 2021 recruits and 2022s, but there aren’t many upsides.”

The _Monmouth University Poll_ was sponsored and conducted by the Monmouth University Polling Institute from April 30 to May 4, 2020 with a national random sample of 808 adults age 18 and older. This includes 285 contacted by a live interviewer on a landline telephone and 523 contacted by a live interviewer on a cell phone, in English. Telephone numbers were selected through random digit dialing and landline respondents were selected with a modified Troldahl-Carter youngest adult household screen. Monmouth is responsible for all aspects of the survey design, data weighting and analysis. The full sample is weighted for region, age, education, gender and race based on US Census information (ACS 2018 one-year survey). Data collection support provided by Braun Research (field) and Dynata (RDD sample). For results based on this sample, one can say with 95% confidence that the error attributable to sampling has a maximum margin of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points (unadjusted for sample design). Sampling error can be larger for sub-groups (see table below). In addition to sampling error, one should bear in mind that question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of opinion polls.

Good morning, troops. It's Tuesday, May 12.
   
 If you were among the 2,100 who attended Michael Jordan's professional- basketball debut some 36 years ago in Peoria and saved the ticket stub, find it.
   
 That piece of pseudo-cardboard might be worth some serious money.
   
 An online sports-memorabilia auction last week included a ticket stub from that NBA preseason game between the Chicago Bulls and the Indiana Pacers, played Oct. 5, 1984, at the Peoria Civic Center Arena.
   
 The stub sold for $34,800.
   
 The original ticket price, for a seat in the second row, was $8.
   
 Representatives of Heritage Auctions, the Dallas-based firm that conducted the sale, appeared surprised the bids reached that level. But not shocked, perhaps.
   
 "After all, this is the first example of this ticket stub to make it to auction, and I suspect there aren't too many 36-year-old preseason ticket stubs around," Heritage representative Chris Ivy stated. "So it's safe to say that this is a rare collectible."
   
 Bidding began at $500. The original estimate was $2,000, according to Heritage sports-production manager and auctioneer Mike Provenzale.
   
 The stub received 31 total bids, Provenzale stated in an email. A few days before the auction ended, the top bid was $950.
   
 But action skyrocketed May 8, the day bidding closed, and into a subsequent extended bidding period.
   
 Jordan had a team-high 18 points for the Bulls in his initial NBA appearance, a 102-98 Bulls victory.
   
 The rest, as they say, has been summarized in recent Sunday nights on "The Last Dance," the 10-part documentary about the Jordan-era, multi-championship Bulls. The final two episodes are to air beginning at 8 p.m. Sunday on ESPN.
   
 Nothing that long-ago autumn night at the Civic Center seemed to suggest what was to come. Particularly in light of Jordan's "Last Dance" revelation about how his Bulls teammates apparently were drugging it up at the team hotel while in Peoria.
   
 Jordan items always have been among the strongest in the sports-collection market, Provenzale suggested. But the ESPN documentary appears to have kicked things up a notch.
   
 Recently, Heritage auctioned a Jordan rookie card for almost $100,000. A pair of cleats Jordan wore during his pro-baseball dalliance in the mid-1990s went for $93,000.
   
 "Interest in Jordan is at an all-time high right now," Provenzale stated. "There are no sports going on (because of COVID-19). 'Last Dance' is essentially the only sports story happening.
   
 "New fans and collectors are getting an in-depth look at a legend, and it has accelerated an already-thriving market for Jordan cards and collectibles."
   
 Wonder how much Nick in the Morning can get for his stub from the legendary Tulsa-Bradley college-basketball showdown in 1982, the not-quite-last game at Robertson Memorial Field House, for the Missouri Valley Conference championship. But some things are priceless.
   
 If memory serves, the song not heard on the way to work, enabled through a random YouTube search, might have been popular not long before MJ came running through the Civic Center tunnel.

The Frederick County Council voted against three amendments aiming to cut money from County Executive Jan Gardner’s (D) budget at its meeting Tuesday, but approved one measure cutting $120,000 in planning costs associated with improving the county courthouse.
 One of the amendments, introduced by Councilman Jerry Donald (D) last week, would have cut $9.1 million in raises and cost of living adjustments for county non-union county workforce (about $3.4 million), Frederick Community College staff (about $1.4 million) and union county workforce (about $4.3 million).
 Donald said last week his amendment was to ensure fairness in cuts across the board. During Tuesday’s meeting, he repeated there was still a “fog” of uncertainty regarding future revenues for county officials.
 “I think we’re going to get hit in the budget more than we think ... I’m just saying we’re in a world we’ve never been before,” he said.
 Donald, along with co-sponsors Steve McKay (R) and Phil Dacey (R), voted for the amendment, citing a need to prepare for those uncertainties and whether raises should be given to county employees when many residents are hurting financially because of the coronavirus pandemic.
 “The people who are hurting are the ones funding the raise, [and] they’re looking at their own checkbooks,” McKay said before Tuesday’s meeting. “When you’re talking about giving county employees the standard annual three percent [raise] ... yeah, it goes to, maybe we can afford it, but should we?”
 Council President M.C. Keegan-Ayer (D), Vice President Michael Blue (R), Councilwoman Jessica Fitzwater (D) and Councilman Kai Hagen (D) voted no, citing a need to honor current contracts signed between Gardner and union employees.
 “I think we have an obligation as a council to be honoring the contracts ... it does not benefit this county at all, if two months later, we turn around and say we’re not going to honor that contract,” Keegan-Ayer said.
 McKay and Dacey introduced the other three amendments. The first cut $2.8 million for raises for non-union county employees, the second cut $1.4 million in raises and cost of living adjustments for Frederick Community College and the third cut $120,000 from costs associated with an improvement project for the county courthouse.
 Amendment 2 also failed with four “no” votes: Keegan-Ayer, Donald, Fitzwater and Hagen. Blue said he would support the amendment because there were no previous agreements, and Donald switched to a “no” vote because he didn’t want to create a situation where county employees in different sectors were treated differently. Amendment 3 also failed by the same 3-4 vote.
 Council members unanimously passed amendment 4, saying there was no need to rush some planning aspects of the county courthouse project.
