This is not our first time. Back in the '70s, Nurse Vivian took me to my first analyst. I'm not sure if she was trying to cure me, but the therapist didn't blink. He talked to me for 15 minutes before he said, "Mrs. Paulson, this isn't the right time for therapy for Kevin. If _you_ , however, have a few minutes to talk, I think Kevin would show significant progress."

_by_ PAUL AMATIOThe newly opened Station of Bullshit at Waigani police station is a clear indication of the lack of vision, focus and foresight in policing techniques and methodologies as well as crime countering tactics making use of and utilising modern capabilities.To me, this whole bullshit about a station of excellence is just that - BULLSHIT!.There is no such thing in the RPNGC or any other police force in the world as a station of excellence. Is this a frigging school or what?In my last post, I spoke about the need to increase, update, and improve our ICT capabilities across the board in the RPNGC.

After five consecutive losses, KXIP finally bounced back from rock bottom and registered consecutive wins against two of the strongest sides ‚Äì Mumbai Indians and Royal Challengers Bangalore. Their batting line-up was never under question as they have the top two run-scorers ‚Äì KL Rahul and Mayank Agarwal of IPL 2020 on their side. Now, they would be looking to avenge their previous loss and this time they would be confident to face a Super Over, as they just beat MI in a match that saw two Super Overs. Things are finally falling in place for KXIP and they would hope to continue their surge against DC. But DC is no easy nut to crack.
