On February 6, 2016, the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, BaFin, placed a moratorium on the business activities of Maple GmbH preventing it from carrying out its normal business activities. In August 2016, Maple filed for bankruptcy protection under applicable Canadian laws, and a trustee was appointed to administer the company. Similar proceedings were initiated for each of Maple's other material subsidiaries in their home jurisdictions. In light of the situation, the Bank wrote off the carrying value of its equity interest in Maple in an amount of $164 million ($145 million net of income taxes) during the first quarter of 2016. The $164 million write-off of the equity interest in this associate was recognized in the _Non-interest income –_ _Other_ item of the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended October 31, 2016 and was reported in the Financial Markets segment.

It’s not clear whether the flurry of activity will lead to actual progress. Time is running out on Congress’ lame-duck session and Donald Trump’s presidency, many Republicans won’t even acknowledge that Trump has lost the election and good faith between the two parties remains in short supply.
 McConnell said his bill, which only modestly tweaks an earlier plan blocked by Democrats, would be signed by Trump and that additional legislation could pass next year. But his initiative fell flat with Democrats and a key GOP moderate.

The Honorable Life of Charles Pepper 1925 to 2020. The Pepper family is sad to announce the passing of Charles, beloved husband of Anne Pepper, now deceased, Past Commander of the Lt. Scott Milley VFW Post 8771, and father of Carol Anne and Robert Charles Pepper. He spent many years in service to the Veterans and the town of Sudbury, his home on Old Orchard since 1956. Charles Pepper was born September 21, 1925 in Melrose, Massachusetts to Edward and Ethel Pepper. Charlie had one sister named Marilyn. As an adolescent, Charlie worked summers on a hundred acre farm in Warren, New Hampshire. He milked cows, drove a team of horses, helped with the haying, and learned to use a rifle. When he was fifteen, he worked part-time after school at the Garniss market in Melrose, where he learned to cut meat. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Charlie enlisted in the Army Air Corp prior to graduation from High School. Charlie was one of only eleven who passed the Aviation Cadet Exam and was accepted into the program. The exam was heavy in math, a subject in which Charlie excelled. Already accustomed to using a weapon from his days on the farm, Charlie qualified as a sharpshooter. The Army Air Force thought at this time that there was no longer a need for any more pilots, so the five hundred men in Charlie's group of cadets were taught to repair airplanes. They were all disappointed, but Charlie felt that the reassignment kept him from being killed, as there were so many downed planes and casualties during the course of the war. He was assigned to the South Pacific, where he served with the 308 Bombardment Wing Heavy Fifth Army Air Force. Assigned to the 308 Bombardment Wing, Pepper was part of General Douglas MacArthur's first task force in the Pacific Theater in a critical juncture of the invasions of the islands of Leyte and Luzon in the Philippines and Okinawa in Japan. Charlie was on Leyte on June 19, 1944 when Admiral William "Bull" Halsey took the Third Fleet in pursuit of the Japanese, leaving the remaining Army forces on the island unprotected, a battled named The Great Marianas Turkey Shoot. Realizing Halsey's mistake in leaving the Army unprotected, General Douglas MacArthur was livid. Charlie was serving on General MacArthurs staff, and was in the tent with him when Halsey and MacArthur had their famous conversation. Their lives in peril, and the planes unable to land on the light carriers amidst enemy fire, the men were totally unprotected. The troops set to work building a landing strip in the jungle. Charlie also served in Okinawa and after in the occupying forces in Korea. In a letter of commendation dated July 22, 1945, Peppers commanding officer, Brigadier General D.W. Hutchison, praised Private Pepper for "the excellent manner and spirit in which you carried out all duties." Hutchinson called Pepper "a credit to the spirit and traditions of the Army Air Forces." Once he returned to Melrose, it took him six years to recover from the recurring bouts of Malaria, Dengue Fever and Trench Foot. He attended Northeastern University thanks to the GI Bill, where he studied Engineering. He met Anne Pepper at a USO Dance. She coyly told him her name was Anne Cole, rather than Anne Colella, and he spent weeks trying to find her. Once he did, they shortly married, saved money, and moved to Sudbury, MA into a new development in 1956. Charlie and Anne were able to put upgrades into their modern Ranch home, and their fathers helped them build a screened in porch on the back of the home. Anne and Charlie adopted two children, first Carol Anne, then Robert Charles. When Carol developed an interest in horses, they built a barn in the back yard and raised a Morgan horse in the then-rural neighborhood. When Robert "Bob" Pepper developed an interest in Little League, Charlie became an Umpire. The Peppers held square dances in the basement, helped Swiss friends adopt a child and were founding members of the Sudbury Gourmet Society in the 1970s. They had an interest in other cultures and international travel and visited Italy, Spain, Bermuda, England, and Canada, as well as touring the United States. Charlie worked at Raytheon in Waltham, Massachusetts for 38 years. He helped with the manufacturing and design of the very first microwave oven, working with the inventor Percy Spencer, who licensed the technology to Raytheon. In his final assignment before retirement, he was in charge of all Shipping and Receiving for the Waltham location, including classified military equipment. Charlie served in leadership positions for over 25 years and was Commander of the VFW Lt. Scott Milley Post 8771 in Sudbury for 17 years, until age 91. He continued to be active until his death. Under his Command, the Sudbury Post began to raise money for charity with the Buddy Poppy drive. Thanks to his leadership and the service of the Vets, the Post raised over $60,000.00 for charity during his tenure. He was instrumental in renaming the VFW Post to honor Lt. Scott Milley in 2011. He visited sick veterans and was beloved for his service to the Community. He was the Sudbury Parade Marshal in 2007. Charlie is survived by his daughter, Carol Anne, who is married to son-in-law Joey Marrian and has a daughter named Zhadaya Marrain, his "step granddaughter," and well as by his son, Robert Charles. He lost his wife Anne in February 2020. He lived a life of honor and service and he will be greatly missed. There is a Funeral Mass honoring Charlie at St. Anselms Church in Sudbury, Massachusetts on Monday, December 6, 2020 at 11:00am. Due to Covid, the service will also be live streamed for those who cannot attend. For an invitation to the Live Stream, please contact Carol Pepper at carol@pepper international.com. He will be buried in Newton Cemetery, where there will be Graveside Service with Honors. Please Magni and Sons Funeral Home for information on the burial and arrangements, (617) 527-2224, www.magnifuneralhome.com. Please visit the memorial Facebook Page, Charles and Anne Pepper 1925 - 2020, where photos and videos will be posted. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that you donate to two of the charities long supported by the Sudbury VFW, where you can donate in his honor.

More than 20% of the counties now have high levels of community transmission, up from 15% in the Nov. 15 report.
 The weekly reports are sent to all state governors, including Gov. Ron DeSantis, documenting the state- and county-level status of the pandemic. However, the governor’s office has opted against making the reports public immediately and has been slow in releasing them in response to record requests.
 The Orlando Sentinel has requested and is waiting for the reports for Nov. 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29. The newspaper, which has repeatedly had to involve its attorneys in order to get the reports from the governor’s office, obtained the reports for Nov. 15 and 22 from a third party.
 “In many areas of the country, mitigation efforts are inadequate or too recently implemented to see a significant impact. All states and all counties must flatten the curve to sustain the health system for both COVID and non- COVID emergencies,” the Nov. 22 report says.
 The document, which is produced by a task force chaired by Vice President Mike Pence, continues to stress the importance of masks and physical distancing -- mitigation efforts that have been absent from Gov. Ron DeSantis’ messaging in recent weeks.
 “Ensure masks at all times in public, increase physical distancing through significant reduction in capacity in public and private indoor spaces, and ensure every American understands the clear risks of ANY family or friend interactions outside of their immediate household indoors without masks,” says the report.
 DeSantis’ office has not said how he uses the reports in his pandemic planning. During a Monday press briefing, DeSantis ruled out imposing any more restrictions or mask mandates.
 “People in Florida wear them when [they] go out. They don’t have to be strung up by a bayonet to do it. Fining people is, I think, totally overboard,” he said during the briefing, one day before the state passed 1 million coronavirus cases. More than 18,600 Floridians have died.
 As of Tuesday, nearly 4,300 patients with COVID-19 were hospitalized in Florida. That’s up from 3,800 patients on Nov. 24 and 3,400 on Nov. 17. And two weeks before that, on Nov. 1, there were 2,400 patients in Florida hospitals because of COVID-19, according to a dashboard maintained by USF epidemiologist Dr. Jason Salemi.
 Central Florida also continues to experience a slow but steady increase in the number of hospitalizations. As of Tuesday, 440 patients were in local hospitals for COVID-19, up from 280 a month ago.
 Statewide, the weekly average number of deaths reported per day rose from 56 on Nov. 1 to 87 on Tuesday, a 55% increase.
 The state continues to remain in the red zone for having a high rate of new cases per capita, ranking 37th in the nation.

VAGANESH, Kosovo (AP) — Blagica Dicic, 92 and in failing health, is the only resident of a remote ethnic Serb minority village in the mountains of eastern Kosovo that's been abandoned by all its other inhabitants — including her own children. Djordje, the eldest son, has moved to Serbia's capital, Belgrade, and has no room for her. She can't remember when they last met. The younger son, Slobodan, lives in council-provided housing in nearby Kamenica town with his paralyzed wife. He rarely visits Dicic. But now, she feels she's got a new son. It's all the more remarkable because Fadil Rama, 54, comes from the other side of Kosovo's bitter ethnic divide, being a member of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority and a Muslim. “I have three sons, not two,” she says, lying in bed with two blankets to cover her in her tiny home in Vaganesh village, 45 kilometers (30 miles) east of the capital Pristina. “Fadil is the other one, bringing me food and taking care of me,” she says, leaning on one elbow as she caresses Rama, who lives less than a mile away in the ethnic Albanian village of Strezovce. Until early November, Dicic enjoyed good health but has now grown weaker and has difficulty standing. Still, she refuses to move out of her dilapidated two-storey home, surviving on a 60-euro ($71) monthly pension and no other official support. It's one of about 50 stone-and-wood-built houses that are slowly collapsing from neglect. Before the 1998-1999 war, more than 200 people lived there. Now they've gone, the last being Dicic' son Slobodan, when his wife fell ill three years ago. The war in the former Serbian province killed more than 10,000 — mostly ethnic Albanians — and ended after a NATO bombing campaign forced Serbia to withdraw its forces that were fighting an...

I remember thinking at the time of the Amazon promo: “But that’s just _e- books_. What about the _real_ books? What about the _real_ best seller lists?” I didn’t talk much about that number 1 spot on Amazon, as I wanted to be loyal to bookstores, particularly indies. As well, I thought it wasn't a legit measure of success. Um, gee, did I think cats were downloading my books? Seriously. Even when an agency contacted my publishers to steal me away from them—how exciting!—I stayed loyal to my publishers and did not make a move.
