Not Ricky though. Ricky saw this as a brand new opportunity to test his new thesis. He stuck around with the people of Alabama and ended up generating $150,000 in realtor fees during the year after the spill, compared to $100,000 the year before. His income grew 50% during a time when realtors were afraid to even step foot in Alabama!

And we’re sure it was scary to stick around after the BP oil spill hit. But Ricky sees fear as a part of success.

Past science suggests that any health impacts from prolonged home confinement are likely to be greatest among older people. In multiple studies, when adults of any age become more inactive because of illness, injury or requests from scientists, they rapidly lose strength and endurance and develop early signs of insulin resistance and molecular changes related to muscle loss. In younger people, such physiological weakening typically reverses as soon as they start moving and exercising normally again. But in older people, the effects can linger and accelerate the onset of frailty.
 Some experts have begun to worry that this scenario is playing out among older people during the coronavirus stay-at-home orders. “I think we’re seeing a slow-motion version of the kind of declines that usually occur when older people are hospitalized or bedridden,” says Dr. Louise Aronson, a professor of geriatrics and health at the University of California, San Francisco, and author of “Elderhood: Redefining Aging, Transforming Medicine, Reimagining Life.”
