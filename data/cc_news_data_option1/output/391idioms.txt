Neymar was not named in the squad for the trip to the third-tier side, with Kylian Mbappe and Angel Di Maria left on the bench for the visit to the Stade du Hameau.
 However, neither was needed as the Ligue 1 leaders comfortably saw off the Championnat National promotion chasers with a goal in each half.
 Leandro Paredes opened the scoring with only his second goal for the club after 25 minutes and Pablo Sarabia made sure of progression eight minutes into the second half.
 PSG had not really threatened when Paredes opened the scoring in style.
 Mauro Icardi laid Layvin Kurzawa's cross into the path of the Argentina midfielder, who controlled brilliantly before lashing a volley beyond Alexis Guendouz.
 Kurzawa then spurned a chance to double the lead as he lashed across the face of goal, but Sarabia made no mistake after the restart.
 Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting saw his point-blank effort from Mauro Icardi's pull back blocked by Damon Bansais and Sarabia was there to convert on the follow- up.
 Pau pushed to try to find a way back into the contest, but a lack of cutting edge in the final third meant an unlikely comeback was never on the cards.

A Raceland man has been ordered to serve 12 years behind bars this week after pleading guilty to shooting at a house last year, prosecutors said.
 Tony Hester, 36, pleaded guilty to possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and two counts of aggravated criminal property damage, prosecutors said.
 After Hester entered his pleas, District court Judge Christopher Boudreaux sentenced him to 12 years for the weapons charge and 10 years for the two property damage charges. The sentences will run concurrently, or at the same time, without probation, parole or early release, prosecutors said.
 Hester was originally arrested on March 17 following an investigation by the Lafourche Parish Sheriff's Office.
 Authorities said Hester fired a gun at an abandoned home, but it was later learned that two rounds fired from his gun also struck an occupied residence on the opposite side.
 After deputies were called out to investigate, they arrested Hester the same day, prosecutors said.
 District Attorney Kristine Russell said Hester's reckless actions did not reflect responsible gun ownership.
 "We have a proud tradition of responsible gun ownership here in Lafourche Parish," Russell said. "What we don't have is tolerance for careless disregard of public safety."
 Assistant District Attorney Greg Stahlnecker, who prosecuted the case, said Hester's choices could have led to much more destructive consequences.
 "Thankfully no one was injured," Stahlnecker said. "The defendant will now have years to rethink his life choices, and hopefully make the appropriate changes."

If your doctor agrees that your symptoms are consistent with possible gallstones, they will likely order an ultrasound of your abdomen, which will identify the presence of gallstones.
 “Once gallstones are identified and you’re having symptoms associated with them, the recommendation is to have your gallbladder removed if you are healthy enough to undergo surgery,” said Dr. Ritter. “Gallstones don’t go away, and the symptoms tend to progress and accelerate over time.”
 Surgery to remove the gallbladder is called a cholecystectomy, and is done as an outpatient operation. It is usually done laparoscopically with small incisions and a camera, also known as minimally invasive surgery.
 “Most people do quite well during their recovery,” Dr. Ritter noted. “You usually have about two to four days of being sore enough to take it easy at home with some pain medications. People take about a work week off on average, and then a couple of weeks of no strenuous activity afterwards.”
 Fortunately, Dr. Ritter reassures, the body can function well without the gallbladder, and there are no major changes needed to your diet and your lifestyle for most people after surgery.
 “Everybody asks what’s going to happen to their bodies after their gallbladder is removed,” she added. “Your liver produces bile, and bile helps digest fats in your food. There’s a main highway between your liver and your intestine, and your gallbladder is a little side street off of that. When we take your gallbladder out, we are only taking that side street away; the stones come with it and any potential to form more stones. So your plumbing is still intact and the bile still gets to your food to help digest fats. It takes a couple of weeks for your body to adapt to the signals being a little bit different, but most people’s bodies do it without too much difficulty.”
  _If your doctor recommends surgery for gallstones, call Sentara Martha Jefferson Medical and Surgical Associates for an appointment at 434-654-5260._

In a report to the county, an engineering consulting firm for the project outlined reasons for the request, which would eliminate some parking spots from the lot.
 “The purpose of these improvements is to keep up with the growing demand for the drive through service option, as drive through sales make up over half of the sales at this location,” the report says.
 Bohler Engineering said the increased drive-thru demand has caused cars to back up, blocking parking spaces adjacent to the building. The changes would help improve traffic circulation and will separate the drive through from the on-site spaces, the report states.
 According to county code, the location would need 60 parking spots based on the square footage, but the proposal only includes 52 spots.

For others, AI is an unknown technology with ambiguous capabilities. It’s viewed as an overwhelming leap forward (often it’s not) and businesses often don’t know where to start. But AI isn’t something to be feared. AI is here today and here to stay. We interact with AI every time we use Netflix, Google, Facebook, etc. and no doubt it will continue to change industries such as marketing. But at the end of the day, the human has the control. Businesses need to think about AI differently—not focusing on the unknown but on the possibilities!

UVa, along with other universities and organizations, will work over the next three years to make such a publishing "pipeline" — as the release referred to the effort — possible.
 Currently, there are only a handful of publishing platforms available to editors, including UVa's Rotunda, which publishes original digital scholarship.
 “The University of Virginia Press has worked closely with the Washington Papers and the Center for Digital Editing since the mid-2000s on our Rotunda digital edition of The Papers of George Washington, and for decades with the documentary editing community as the publisher of editions of George Washington, James Madison, John Jay and other major figures,” said David Sewell, manager of digital initiatives at UVa Press. “We are pleased that our collaboration will now expand to enable a wider universe of documentary editors to take advantage of digital preparation and publication for their projects.”
