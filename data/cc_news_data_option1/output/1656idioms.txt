But first, to get up to speed on what's been going on in Chicago, including Mayor Lori Lightfoot's closures of key bike commuting routes and parks, as well as the Active Transportation Alliance's decision to essentially oppose open streets, read the new Chicago Reader article on the subject by Streetsblog's Courtney Cobbs and myself. One of Active Trans' stated reasons for not supporting open streets is "In conversations with community partners serving Latinx, Black, and Asian communities, nobody pointed to open streets as an immediate need." The advocacy group declined to tell us which community partners they were talking about.

Then you add in the other ingredients until it forms something that does somewhat resemble a traditional bread dough - although it smells unnervingly lemony. Next you whack it in the microwave for 90 seconds, and out it comes all puffed up like a loaf of bread.
 It didn't look good, the air bubble had broken through the top of the bread and looked odd, and the 'bread' had also started peeling away from the sides of the mug and looked quite doughy.
 It was at this point I realised the recipe recommended you toast the bread - hardly a sign of something being good.

Washington D.C. [USA], April 28 (ANI): American actor Tom Cruise apparently wasn't exactly in a sharing mood when he started filming 'The Outsiders.'   According to Fox News, actor Rob Lowe made the revelation when he recently appeared on Dax Shepard's podcast 'Armchair Expert,' where he opened up about working on the 1983 coming-of-age drama, in which Lowe starred as one of the Greasers, Sodapop Curtis, alongside Cruise who played Steve Randle.   Lowe told Shepard that the 'Mission Impossible' star couldn't keep it together upon learning he would be bunking with Lowe while filming the movie, which was directed by 'The Godfather' creator Francis Ford Coppola.   The 56-year-old actor explained to Shepard, "All of the L.A. people survived the L.A. auditions, and then the hand-picked people had to go to New York to face the New York version. So it was me and Tom Cruise and Emilio [Estevez] and C. Thomas Howell."   He recalled to the 45-year-old 'Spin the Wheel' host, "[It was the] first time I ever stayed at The Plaza Hotel, and we check-in, and Tom finds out that we're sharing a room and just goes ballistic."   The pair worked side-by-side though, Lowe quipped to Shepard that Cruise simply knew his value and recalled the 'Top Gun' star doing his own stunts early on his career.   Lowe said, "He ended up being the only one who could do a backflip. It is in the movie 'The Outsiders' for no reason.' He runs out of the house and does a backflip for no reason. Just to do it."   The movie had an ensemble cast, including Matt Dillon, Patrick Swayze, Ralph Macchio, and Emilio Estevez, which Lowe believed fed into the huge chip the 57-year-old star-Cruise, kept on his proverbial shoulder.   Lowe said, "To me, what's great about the story is, there are certain people who have always been who they are, and that element of them has powered them to where they are today and the rest is history. And the notion that an 18-year-old actor with a walk-on part in 'Endless Love' and like the seventh lede in 'Taps' could have that kind of like wherewithal."   The 'Young Blood' star then pressed on and praised Cruise adding that he was blown away by the 'Collateral' performer's acting chops. Lowe said, "I remember going, 'Wow, this guy is the real deal. I mean it made me laugh, it was gnarly. But in the end of it, you can't argue with the results. He's had his eye on the ball since day one." (ANI)

 And yes, the voiced dialogue in the localized version is still in Japanese. For me, that's actually not a problem because I prefer Japanese voice acting for anime-style games like this. I also find the lack of an English dub understandable due to the costs that such an endeavor entails, especially for a series that doesn't exactly have a strong following outside of Japan. That being said, if you're someone who prefers your media to be dubbed, the lack of English voice acting will still be a bummer.
 On the plus side, you can still enjoy the narrative despite the absence of voiced English dialogue. Storytelling, after all, is a big part of the Sakura Taisen series and the new Sakura Wars isn't any different. This time around, you play an all-new protagonist in Seijuro Kamiyama, a former Navy captain who is reassigned to a Tokyo-based anti-Demon fighting force known as the Imperial Combat Revue. As in past games, the members of this division double up not just as fighters but also as theater actors who perform shows for the public. Unlike the Imperial Combat Revue's legendary Flower Division of past games, however, the current group has fallen on hard times. Thanks to a lack of support from the people, the military and the government, the Imperial Combat Revue has to scrape by a meager existence. This is all happening despite Kanzaki Heavy Industries heir and former Flower Division fighter Sumire Kanzaki taking the helm of the organization.
 Let me just say, by the way, how happy I was to see Sumire appear onscreen the first time that I saw her. She was actually my favorite character from the original series and it was nice to see her strutting around the theater like a flamboyant peacock once more. Even Sumire, however, is not a miracle worker and after pouring in her own resources into the organization, the lack of successful results has finally caught up to the struggling organization. Whether it be the once mighty Grand Imperial Theater or the Flower Division's spiricle robots, everything is aging and practically falling apart. As a final act of ignominy, the Flower Division also has to rely on the Shanghai Combat Revue to defend its own city from demon attacks due to the perceived inadequacies of the Tokyo team. It is under this depressing backdrop that Seijuro arrives on the scene and is given the task to turn the downtrodden organization around. A former rising star in the Navy, Seijuro himself has his own literal and personal demons to deal with. This makes the flawed yet promising officer the perfect captain for an equally flawed yet promising team.

 The new combat system, by the way, is one of the potentially controversial changes in Sakura Wars. In past games, every episode ends with a tactical battle that used to be done in a strategy-RPG style. Sakura Wars nixes that, however, for real-time, hack-and-slash combat instead. Some fans of the old strategy system might decry the decision. Then again, this change was likely done to make the game more appealing to a wider audience. The combat itself is like a mix of Dynasty Warriors with some Bayonetta-style bullet-time thrown in when dodging at the last second. A patch that was released prior to release day also added the ability to lock on to enemies. This is a huge help because it was a pain to keep track of enemies and also easy for your super attacks to miss prior to the lock-on patch. When facing a bunch of enemies, you can also cycle through them by moving the right analog stick left or right.
 Admittedly, the fights can get a bit repetitive, especially when going against mobs. To make things interesting, the game adds a gauge that you can build up by performing certain actions like perfect evades and link attacks. Filling up the gauge improves your performance in battle and also affects your final grade so you want to get it as high as possible every time. On the plus side, combat becomes much more interesting when fighting stronger foes one-on-one or facing the game's bosses. Bosses, for example, typically have a certain gimmick that you need to figure out such as destroying all parts at the same time in order to stagger it. Others, such as major antagonist Yaksha, try to overwhelm you with speed and power and you will need to master perfect evasions in order to take them down. You're also graded during fights based on factors such as your clear time, how much damage you inflicted and the number of enemies you destroyed.
 Add the varying combat styles of the different Flower Division members and the combat actually becomes quite fun once you get the hang of it. Kamiyama's dual-sword melee style, for example, is intuitive to use and feels rewarding. Azami's quick-striking ninjutsu, on the other hand, makes it easier to time perfect evasions. Anastasia's ranged hits, meanwhile, feel satisfying and her use of an old-school umbrella when she soars in the air is a nice added touch that looks cool to boot. Naturally, super attacks also look flashy and powerful combination attacks between the squad captain and the various Flower Division maidens also make a return.
