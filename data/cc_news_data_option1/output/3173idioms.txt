Our first ultrasound was scheduled for March 3. At eight weeks, our baby didn't yet look like a baby. According to the pregnancy website we consulted each week, she was only as big as a raspberry.
 Still, she had a heartbeat — and when we heard it, my partner, Billy, excitedly grabbed my hand. We laughed in surprise and flashed giant smiles at the ultrasound technician, who grinned back at us.
 That was our last prenatal appointment of the Before Times.
 On March 11, Covid-19 was declared a pandemic. At every clinic visit since that declaration, I've been greeted at the front door by a staffer who asks a series of questions about any potential contact with the virus and symptoms I might be experiencing. Billy is no longer allowed to attend appointments with me. Like everyone else at the doctor's office, I wear a mask.
 Now when I hear our daughter's heartbeat, there's no one to grab my hand. My smile stays hidden behind the fabric that covers my face.
 Prenatal appointments aren't the only thing that's different about what I imagined pregnancy would be like.
 Billy and I won't have a traditional baby shower, take a "babymoon" trip or enjoy any last hurrahs on the town with our childless friends. I haven't been able to attend in-person birth classes or visit friends who have recently welcomed their own babies to the world. I don't get to hold another infant and take notes ahead of time about how to wrap a proper swaddle or change a diaper like a pro.
 Instead, Billy and I are learning what we can from the safety of our home. We've read articles and books, signed up for online courses and accepted advice from friends.
 There's a stack of parenting and pregnancy books in the room that will soon be our daughter's nursery. The ubiquitous "What to Expect When You're Expecting," is among the paperbacks. Funny enough, there's no chapter on what to expect when you're expecting in a pandemic.
 Like so many of us, Dr. Lucy J. Puryear has had to adjust how she works in the pandemic. Puryear, a psychiatrist specializing in the emotional health of pregnant women and new mothers, and author of "Understanding Your Moods When You're Expecting," now sees all of her patients virtually.
 She has to help new parents readjust expectations around what their postpartum support systems might look like. And, more than ever, she has to take her own advice.
 "I tell patients to try not to get overwhelmed with when this is going to end," Puryear said. "Look at a week at a time — that's about the best we can do at the moment. Focus on what doctor's appointments you have, what's going on with your body, things like that that are tangible."
 "Pregnancy, even without a pandemic, is a time of unknowns and uncertainties," added Puryear. "The fear of the virus has heightened that."
 She's seen many pregnant mothers who have concerns about their own health and safety, and the health and safety of their unborn children. "They're also dealing with immediate fears about things like whether their partners will be allowed in the hospital or whether they'll be giving birth alone," she said.

Det är väl fullt möjligt att snart göra en CPU som inte är x86 som är snabbare och drar mindre ström än en Xeon.
 Däremot det där med x86 kompatibilitet etc så är det genom vanlig traditionell emuleringslösning.
 "Unlike, say, Transmeta, Centaur, or other x86 clones, Prodigy gets its x86 compatibility purely through software emulation, with no particular hardware assist. That ability comes courtesy of QEMU, the open-source emulation package. Danilak says Prodigy can run user-mode binaries at about 50% of native speed, based on his company’s simulations. That’s fast enough for most customers, he says, because it gets them up and running until such time as they convert and recompile their apps into native Prodigy code."
 50% verkar dock inte så bra, har för mig gamla DEC Alpha sades ligga på runt 70% native x86 när man körde Windows NT, med liknande lösningar.

I worry about these things, too. At this point, my midwife tells me that Billy will be allowed in the hospital — but we won't be able to tour it in person beforehand. I worry about what it will be like to be in a medical setting for so long, and how many precautions we'll have to take to protect ourselves.
 That's not to say that everything is terrible. I've found some surprising silver linings to being pregnant during a global pandemic. I get to spend more time at home, and I don't have to worry about unwanted comments or belly touches from strangers. Billy and I have enjoyed more time to nest and more opportunities to focus on becoming parents.
 There are also plenty of things that aren't that different. In a very clichéd move, I've been craving pickles and ice cream. People still get excited to see the baby bump — even if it is over video calls. And I've already had to tell my mom to stop buying too many tiny clothes for her first grandchild.
 Puryear pointed to another benefit of having a baby during this time: So many people working at home has resulted in a more equitable split of parenting duties.
 "Many dads or partners are getting to spend more time with the baby than they would otherwise," she said. "Lately, we're seeing more sharing of responsibilities than we would have normally, when only one parent was on traditional maternity leave."
 Every other week or so, I meet with a group of other new-moms-to-be via Zoom. A mutual friend had the smart idea of connecting all of us. We're scattered across the country but share the unique experience of being pregnant during such a surreal time.
 We talk about "normal" pregnancy topics, like the baby kicks and discomfort we're each feeling, and we also discuss the various bits of Covid-related information and advice we've gleaned from our doctors and the internet.
 Lately, we've spent a lot of time comparing our plans for allowing (or not allowing) family members to visit after birth. Billy and I are still figuring out the logistics of it all.
 The pandemic, Puryear said, has provided a useful metaphor for parenting.
 "This is a really good way to learn that you have to let go of your sense of control," she said. "That's going to be true for the rest of your life as a parent. You do the best you can, with the information you have."
 I'm due in mid-October. Based on the spread of cases, especially in Florida, where I live, I fully anticipate that the virus will still greatly affect daily life by then.
 Just as my pregnancy hasn't lined up with expectations, I doubt that giving birth will be like I imagined it to be either. I don't know exactly what I envisioned, but it didn't involve laboring through contractions while wearing a mask.
 Still, as long as I can give birth to my daughter safely, I'm good.
 "The best piece of advice I have is to take this all a day at a time and a week at a time," said Puryear. "It's OK to have wishes and desires about how your pregnancy should go, but at the end of the day all you want is a healthy baby. No matter how that happens, it's what matters most."
 The exciting thing about babies is that everything is brand new for them. This time, it's brand new for all of us. The world may not look like I imagined it would, but our little family will figure out how to navigate it together.

MACOMB - While the decision to move Missouri Valley Football to the spring has been a frustrating one for some, Western Illinois football coach is focusing on the positives and encouraging his players to do the same.
   
 The league announced Friday night it would move its conference schedule to the spring, and with a groundswell of support for moving the FCS postseason to the spring as well, Elliott is encouraging his squad to look on the bright side about what is to come.
   
 "One thing we discussed when everything started to happen in the early spring and the virus really began to spread and shut everything down, we talked a lot about controlling the things we can control and not worry about the things we can't," Elliott said. "One thing we can control is abiding by the protocols given us, the guidelines we have, I've been extremely proud of our team for doing the things they need to do.
   
 "It says a lot about the maturity of our team, they bought in to doing the things they need to do to protect themselves and their teammates and what we want to accomplish as a team."
   
 And while the team did everything it could to have a fall season only to see plans not come to pass, Elliott knows his squad did all it could.
   
 "Our guys had to go through a two-week quarantine when they came on campus and they did a tremendous job with that, social distancing, masking, protecting each other, so we are very fortunate with where we stand," the coach said. "We had a very good plan in place, I know there is some frustration because they did everything we asked, but all we can do now is put ourselves in a position to move forward for when we can compete.
   
 "There's so much out of our control, it's easy to look at the negatives and be frustrated, but there are silver linings to everything and our guys understand that."
   
 After having spring ball canceled last spring and summer and fall ball pushed back, Elliott knows his team can still get plenty of work done, whether they get in a handful of games or not.
   
 "We have a lot of new additions to our team, so we can continue gelling for next season, this gives us another opportunity to get in the weight room and make up for lost time," the coach said. "When COVID hit in the spring, we lost spring ball, we lost that time in the summer when we can develop together, now we have an opportunity to get that time back, make sure the give properly prepare in a healthy and safe manner.
   
 "There are positives, we have to focus on those, control what we can control because there are a lot of things out of our hands. As a coach, it's tough, you want to have all the answers for your guys and be in control of everything, but whenever anyone says they're ready for us to play ball, we'll be ready to do that."
   
 And getting the focus of his squad back on training instead of a potential Week 1 opponent should not be difficult.
   
 "We're really buying into protecting our bubble, getting back in the weight room, getting strong, conditioning ourselves and making up for lost time for when we do figure out what everything is going to look like," Elliott said. "We're going quarter by quarter but quarter, we've broken everything down into different phases and how we're going to approach each quarter.
   
 "From now until when school starts is first quarter, get in the weight room, take advantage of extra conditioning. Second quarter is the fall ball, hopefully something similar to spring camp, third quarter is whenever we can get going in January or February leading up to the season, then it's time for the fourth quarter, our conference slate, preparing to finish. It's how we're going to approach everything, approach our process, living in the moment, waking up where our feet are, keeping that positive outlook about getting better."

As President Vladimir Putin of Russia triumphantly declared on Tuesday that his country had produced the world’s first coronavirus vaccine, public health experts in the United States worried that Trump would feel compelled to compete in a pharmaceutical manhood contest by hastily rolling out his own vaccine even before it is fully tested.
 “I am sure that this will give him more impetus to push US R&D and FDA to move more quickly,” Margaret Hamburg, a Food and Drug Administration commissioner under President Barack Obama, said, referring to research and development. “If he believes that testing causes cases, I suspect he may believe that if you don’t test a vaccine or drug, they must be OK.”
 The announcement in Moscow roiled the international quest to stop the pandemic in what had already developed into a geopolitical race among the world’s biggest powers. The Russian vaccine, approved without the sort of extensive trials typically required in the West, may work, American scientists said. But if it does not, the rushed process could pose dangers not just for Russians but for many others if Trump seeks to match the supposed achievement prematurely.
 The search for a vaccine has already been caught in a whirlwind of pressures as the Trump administration scrambles to develop a drug to combat a virus that has killed more than 164,000 Americans. Two pharmaceutical companies have moved to Phase 3 trials in the United States, the final stage of testing before a vaccine can be approved. But scientists have expressed concern that the trials would be short-circuited by Trump’s desire for a political win before the general election Nov. 3.
 The White House has said that data, not politics, will govern the decision to approve a vaccine, although Trump has repeatedly linked his Operation Warp Speed to the campaign calendar. He has suggested that a vaccine could be rolled out by Election Day even though scientists said it would take until early next year to complete the trials.
 “We’re doing very well in everything including corona, as you call it,” Trump said in an interview Tuesday with radio host Hugh Hewitt. “But let me just tell you, we’re getting to an end. We’re getting to, and the vaccines are ready to rock. We’re going to be very close to a vaccine. We’re ready to distribute.”
 At a news briefing later in the day, the president offered no comment on Russia’s announcement but made a point of boasting about the “tremendous progress” on an American vaccine and asserted that “we’re moving very close to that approval.”
 “Operation Warp Speed is the largest and most advanced operation of its kind anywhere in the world and anywhere in history,” he said, his competitive juices on display.
 Putin saw no need to wait for more expansive testing in Russia, where the medical system is not considered as rigorous as in the United States, despite the prospect that it may not work as advertised or may even prove unsafe. But in doing so, he put Trump in an awkward position given the friendship between the two men.
 The announcement immediately spurred suspicion among Trump’s domestic opponents. “This Putin vaccine thing is all about him giving the alleged science to Trump so the President can take personal credit for a vaccine ahead of the U.S. elections,” former Rep. David Jolly of Florida, who left the Republican Party partly out of protest over Trump, wrote on Twitter.
 David Kramer, a Russia scholar at Florida International University and a former assistant secretary of state under President George W. Bush, said Trump should use the moment to put his desire for better relations with Russia to the test.
 “Aside from arms control, fighting the virus would be one issue where we and Russia should work together and not be another source of competition,” he said. “The speed with which the Russians have found a vaccine has to raise concerns, however, and risks exacerbating the level of distrust between our two sides if it does not work or even does harm.”
 The vaccine race comes at a time when Washington is already engaging in a new debate over how to recalibrate relations between the two powers after the election. A group of 103 former Cabinet secretaries, ambassadors and other officials from Democratic and Republican administrations published an open letter last week in Politico arguing for an effort to “put the relationship on a more constructive path.”
 Another group of former officials, this one with 33, led by Kramer, published its response Tuesday rejecting a new “reset” and arguing that Putin’s regime poses “a threat to American interests and values, requiring strong pushback.”
 The relationship has been dominated by the aftermath of the 2016 election, when Russia intervened in the American campaign to help Trump, according to intelligence agencies and a special counsel investigation. While no charges were brought alleging a criminal conspiracy, Trump has at times rejected even that Russia played a role, calling it a hoax.
 Just last week, U.S. intelligence agencies reported that Russia was still trying to intervene in American elections to help reelect Trump, a conclusion that the president likewise instantly rejected. “I think that the last person Russia wants to see in office is Donald Trump because nobody has been tougher on Russia than I have, ever,” he said at a briefing for reporters.
 Told that was not what the intelligence agencies were finding, Trump snapped, “Well, I don’t care what anybody says.”
 He defended himself further on Tuesday when Hewitt asked who had been tougher on Russia, Trump or Obama. “By a factor of 50, me, OK?” Trump said, arguing that he built up the U.S. military and sent weapons to Ukraine for its continuing conflict with Russia.
 As he often does, however, Trump laced his answer with factual fallacies. He boasted that he sent Javelin anti-tank weapons to Ukraine when Obama would not, which is true. But what Trump did not say was that his administration barred the Ukrainians from actually using the Javelins and mandated that they be kept locked up far from the battlefront.
 The president likewise boasted that “I got NATO to pay $400 billion a year more to protect themselves against Russia.” That is not true. NATO has projected that the allies will increase military spending by a cumulative $400 billion from 2016 to 2024, meaning over eight years, not each year. Similarly, Trump said he “spent $2.5 trillion” on the U.S. military, but that credits him with every dollar spent on defense over three years and then some, not just the increases he helped push through.
 It is true that his administration has taken aggressive action to counter Russia at times — including sanctions, diplomatic expulsions and modest troop deployments to Eastern Europe — but Trump has left the tough talk to his subordinates and rarely if ever has a word of criticism of Putin, whose leadership and strength he has publicly praised. Indeed, Trump has spoken repeatedly with Putin in recent months without once raising intelligence reports that Russia has paid bounties to Afghan fighters to kill U.S. soldiers. Trump dismissed the reports from his own administration as “fake news.”
 In a separate string of Twitter messages Tuesday, Trump disputed the notion that he trusted Putin more than U.S. intelligence agencies, but he then proceeded to explain why he would doubt his own country’s security apparatus, pointing back to his first encounter with veteran intelligence officials that he later came to consider his enemies.
 “John Bolton, one of the dumbest people I’ve met in government and sadly, I’ve met plenty, states often that I respected, and even trusted, Vladimir Putin of Russia more than those in our Intelligence Agencies,” Trump wrote, referring to his own former national security adviser.
 “While of course that is not true,” he continued, “if the first people you met from so called American Intelligence were Dirty Cops who have now proven to be sleazebags at the highest level like James Comey, proven liar James Clapper, & perhaps the lowest of them all, Wacko John Brennan who headed the CIA, you could perhaps understand my reluctance to embrace!”

Either way, few believed Llorente&#39;s two goals in extra-time would be the start of something even more surprising, namely Simeone lifting the cup in May. Certainly nobody anticipated football shutting down completely the following week, as nervousness turned to indignation about Atletico fans traveling to Anfield, before matches behind closed doors became matches postponed indefinitely. And yet when football returned in June, Atletico was transformed. The club went unbeaten in the 11 games after the resumption, to dispel concerns it could miss out on La Liga&#39;s four. The team won seven matches and drew four, one of them against Barcelona at Camp Nou, which helped Real Madrid clinch the title. Atletico scored 20 goals and conceded six.

Dice Circe que no tiene nada de malo darse un gusto a través de la comida, el problema es que lo placentero se asocia con lo que engorda como las grasas y los antojitos, también con las porciones y no con lo saludable como puede ser una buena ensalada o un buen pescado.
