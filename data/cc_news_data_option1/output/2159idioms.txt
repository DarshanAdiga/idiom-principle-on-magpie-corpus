Yeah, absolutely. You know, for platform cross-play, you're always going to want to buy at least the base game bundle in order to just gain access to the game on the platform, but after that, any additional progress or purchases that are made, you'll have full access on both.

COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) - From New York City to Fargo, North Dakota, cities across the United States say they are issuing curfews to keep the peace. But the deadlines aren't hard and fast - many of them have exceptions for people heading to and from work, reporters, public transportation and even people buying groceries. A curfew allows police the ability without any other reason to threaten to arrest or detain crowds of protesters that linger or groups that appear to be a danger to order. Curfews have been installed in Los Angeles, Atlanta, Denver, Philadelphia and hundreds of other cities and communities

“It really doesn’t matter,” I said, and I meant it. As everyone else out and about last night, we were mildly euphoric – and might well have gone home happy having not eaten at all. It seemed that, for the time being at least, we’d overcome an enemy – and were on absolutely the same side as our restaurateur.

 From the time the virus was first decoded on Jan. 2 to when WHO declared a global emergency on Jan. 30, the outbreak grew by a factor of 100 to 200 times, according to retrospective Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention data.
 WHO and officials named in this story declined to answer questions asked by the AP without audio or written transcripts of the recorded meetings, which the AP was unable to supply to protect its sources.
 "Our leadership and staff have worked night and day….to support and share information with all Member States equally, and engage in frank and forthright conversations with governments at all levels," a WHO statement said.
 China's National Health Commission and Ministry of Foreign Affairs had no comment. But in the past few months, China has repeatedly defended its actions, and many other countries -- including the U.S. -- have responded to the virus with even longer delays of weeks and even months.
 In late December, doctors noticed mysterious clusters of patients with unusual pneumonia. Seeking answers, they sent samples to commercial labs. By Dec. 27, one company, Vision Medicals, had pieced together most of the genome of a new virus with striking similarities to SARS. They alerted Wuhan officials, who, days later, issued internal notices warning of the unusual pneumonia.
 On Dec. 30, Shi Zhengli, a renowned coronavirus expert at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, was alerted to the disease, and by Jan. 2, her team had fully decoded it.
 But when it came to sharing the genome with the world, things went awry. China's top medical authority, the National Health Commission, issued a confidential notice forbidding labs from publishing about the virus without authorization. The order barred Shi's lab from publishing the sequence or warning of the possible danger.
 Commission officials later said the order was to prevent any accidental release of the then-unknown pathogen, and to ensure consistent results by giving it to four state labs to identify at the same time.

But Elder Scrolls Online works really well with controllers already, so the transition is surprisingly natural. I think you'll find when you jump on the phone and play, you'll actually be pretty surprised by how well the UI scales and how everything works. It's been a super neat experience I'll say, just from dev perspective when we're on a meeting and we're talking about details and then somebody passes a smartphone around with this huge game just streaming on a smartphone, even some of the devs that have worked on it for quite a while, you see it in their eyes. It's really neat, we're excited to get that into player hands.

We're super excited to get this on board. We've been working on it for quite a while in various degrees. One of the neat things with integration would be the fact that we were working on this alongside stadia while the platform has been developed, so that gave us some interesting opportunities to work with, just to make sure that the integration was as smooth as possible. The Google Stadia team helped us overcome some of the challenges of just being in a really big and technically complex game. Right now we're kind of in the phases where we're through, we're getting through final certification. We're crossing the T's and dotting the I's, and the team is very excited to get this thing live on the 16th.

But, frankly, neither health nor economic doom worries were getting through to the squares, streets and terraces of Montpellier yesterday. Further optimism was generated by the re-opening of beaches, campsites and museums. Hotels were also back in business. Most visible, though, was the joyous re-colonisation of their city by a zillion Montpellierains. The Mediterranean need to get out of doors and socialise around laden tables had been suppressed for too long. Last night, it burst forth again, at last.

Eduardo Munoz/ReutersNYPD officers keep an eye on protesters in Brooklyn on Saturday while they clash during a march against the death in Minneapolis police custody of George Floyd.
 After every time the cops charged, the protesters reassembled, staring down their heavily armed attackers, preparing for the next onslaught. They chanted, "Say her name! Breonna Taylor!" and "Say his name! George Floyd!"
 They taunted the cops with chants of "NYPD, suck my dick!" and climbed atop a city bus abandoned in the street by its driver, arms outstretched as if, for a moment, the city where they lived actually belonged to them.
 The battle lines started to dissolve. Cops ran riot after protesters all along Church Avenue as helicopters circled overhead, occasionally shining spotlights down onto the scattered melees.
 I started to film the police charge as I walked backward with a group of retreating protesters, my press pass dangling from my neck.
 A sprinting cop veered toward me and bumped into me with his shoulder as he ran past, yelling "Get out my way!" even though there was plenty of room around me.
 I'd been watching the cops toss around young New Yorkers all day, pressing their faces into the concrete and cursing at them. I was worked up.
 "Fuck you," I told the cop.
 He stopped charging after the protesters and circled back to me, shoving a baton into my chest and knocking me to the curb.
 I don't know how many cops piled on top of me, but there were a lot. A knee or a foot pressed my head and neck into the concrete. Hands tugged at my legs and arms in different directions while different voices issued impossible demands.
 "Put your left hand behind your back!" The way my body was twisted, I couldn't. "Stop resisting!" I wasn't.
 I asked them to look at my press pass. I told them I was a journalist. I begged them to get my phone, which had fallen out of my hand during the fracas.
 "Shut the fuck up," I heard one cop say.
 When they cuffed me and stood me up, a white cop, maskless and with rage in his eyes, came within a few inches of my face. "Fucking asshole," he called me.  
 Again and again, my press pass clearly visible on my neck, I pleaded for the cops to get my phone, worried that I'd lose so much of what I'd documented that day. The cops refused, leaving it on the street before escorting me to the police van.
 If this is how they treat a white journalist, I thought.
