Rituals are different from rules or company policies and from habits or routines. Rules or company policies set out what is expected of employees. They are typically the general guidelines for what it takes to succeed–both individually and as a company. Habits or routines are the details that we take for granted. They are what we do every day without really thinking about why or how. They help us get the job done, because they make what it takes to do the job second nature. If rules or policies were the bones, habits and routines would be the flesh that makes the body strong and fit to move.

As shown by data compiled from the now-deleted review by Videocardz, the RTX 3090 outperforms the RTX 3080 by roughly 10% across 16 tests.
 In 3D Mark Time Spy Extreme, for example, the RTX 3090 scores 9940, a 10.5% increase over the RTX 3080, but in titles such as Rainbow Six Weight and Forza Horizon it outperforms its more affordable sibling by just 5.8% and 4.7%, respectively.
 The biggest gains were seen in Death Stranding (with DLSS switched off) where the RTX 3090 performed 11.5% faster than the RTX 3080.
 These scores are somewhat disappointing, especially when you consider the major price difference between the RTX 3090 and RTX 3080.
 However, with the RTX 3090 seemingly not delivering the levels of performance that Nvidia has promised, it’s likely the GPU is being bottlenecked by software. If that's the case, we'll hopefully see some performance improvements once the card is officially released.
 The Nvidia RTX 3090 goes on sale September 24, priced at $1,499 (£1,399, around AU$2,030).

American Express boosted the perks on some of its premium cards once again as the card issuer tries to keep a lid on attrition during the coronavirus pandemic.
 Consumers with the firm’s platinum, gold and green cards will have free access to Uber Technologies Inc.’s Eats Pass — a subscription that typically costs $119 a year and offers discounts on the company’s food-delivery service. Gold- card customers also will receive $10 a month in Uber Cash, which can be used toward rides or food delivery, starting early next year.
 “Our card members crave food experiences and we’re seeing that they’re continuing to seek out food-delivery services to create those special experiences at home,” Rachel Stocks, Amex’s executive vice president for global premium products and benefits, said in a statement Monday.
 Amex, long known for its premium travel and dining perks, has seen spending on its cards suffer during the pandemic as consumers have stayed home to stem the spread of Covid-19. That’s led the card company to quickly revamp some of its most popular cards to avoid losing customers.

“It’s going to be a culmination of a lot of things because there’s so much buildup with the fan base and with the organization and with the players,” said Hershiser, now a broadcaster for the Dodgers’ Spectrum SportsNet LA network. “Even if it was won in ’17, it would’ve been a long time. I think it’s very hard as far as the playoffs are concerned. In no way was the ’88 Dodger team supposed to win against the mighty Mets and against the Bash Brother Oakland A’s. So sometimes maybe the best team on paper and talent on the field doesn’t always win.”

In response to these changing preferences we'll be continuing the store rationalization efforts we've already accomplished, which includes 130 consolidations since 2014. Our plan is to reduce another 30 to 50 locations over the next two years. Our target is to get to a total store count between 180 to 200 stores by the end of 2022.
