The Livingston County Sheriff‚Äôs Office and the Livingston County Prosecutor‚Äôs Office are not enforcing the stay-home order and have opted for a more education-based approach.

Murphy says this was not a political decision, noting that he was initially behind the Governor in the beginning that there needed to be a lockdown to get a handle on things and understand the situation ‚Äì likening it to a criminal investigation. He‚Äôs not convinced the Governor had the authority to extend the emergency orders and says it‚Äôs gotten to the point now where it‚Äôs gone too far and things probably need to start loosening up. If there are executive order violations out there, then he invites people to contact the Attorney General‚Äôs Office and they can handle the investigations. He says they‚Äôve had ample time to figure things out so they can‚Äôt claim being overwhelmed or lack of a process. Murphy says everything was basically just dumped on law enforcement in the beginning and his men and women are not going to do executive order violations anymore but rather concentrate on real police work.

Georgia's chief economist told lawmakers Thursday that a return to normalcy is needed to soften the blow to the state's $27 billion budget, which is set for deep cuts amid coronavirus-prompted closures.
   
 That assessment was one of several that budget-writing state lawmakers got Thursday in a sobering overview of the sharp drop in tax revenues poised drive the General Assembly's upcoming budget negotiations.
   
 Whether Georgia bounces back enough to soften the budgetary blow will depend on how confident consumers feel to venture out of their homes to shop and return to work, Jeffrey Dorfman, the state economist, told lawmakers Thursday.
   
 "It's all going to depend on consumers and when we feel safe," Dorfman said. "When we choose to [return to] normal is what's going to matter."
   
 Revenues from income, sales and other taxes in Georgia were down almost $1 billion for the month of April compared to April of last year, as both mandatory and voluntary actions taken to curb the virus' spread saw businesses close and people stay put in their homes.
   
 Lawmakers now face the need to make steep spending cuts, press for federal relief and pull from Georgia's emergency reserves to balance the budget.
   
 Some measures have eased the pain from coronavirus like a boost in online retail sales and purchases of alcohol by home-bound Georgians. But a spike in unemployment claims, plummeting of sales taxes on hotel stays and general merchandise, and the delayed deadline to file state income taxes have combined to put Georgia in a serious financial bind.
   
 "You're going to see some crazy economic numbers in the news over the next couple of months," Dorfman said Thursday.
   
 Members of the Georgia House and Senate Appropriations committees met jointly Thursday in an online meeting for the first time in the coronavirus era. They plan to hold another virtual meeting next Wednesday before convening in person later this month, ahead of a June 30 deadline to pass the 2021 fiscal year budget.
   
 Lawmakers have already asked state agencies to start preparing for 14% cuts across the board in next year's budget, with revenue forecasters expecting a decline of between $3 and $4 billion in tax collections in the coming months. Those cuts will almost certainly lead to scaled-back services and furloughs for teachers, social workers and more.
   
 "We understand that times are tough for y'all and for us," said House Appropriations Committee Chairman Terry England, R-Auburn. "We appreciate and take very seriously our roles here and what we're trying to do and to be good stewards of taxpayer dollars."
   
 Dorfman, the state economist, told lawmakers Thursday the full impacts of the crisis are tough to predict since the only comparable historical event was the Spanish Flu of 1918, for which he said there is not much useful data.
   
 Instead, lawmakers should plan to see a continuing downward trend in revenues through at least this month in sales taxes and for much longer when it comes to corporate tax collections, with businesses poised for months of diminished profits, Dorfman said.
   
 "We don't really have a good idea based on history of how this is going to go," Dorfman said. "Hopefully, in the weeks and months to come, we'll get a better idea as we experience this together."
   
 The worst economic data is expected to come after Memorial Day (May 25) when officials will learn how bad tax collections were during Georgia's mandatory shelter-in-place period last month, said Kelly Farr, director of the state Office of Planning and Budget.
   
 Speaking at Thursday's meeting, Farr credited lawmakers for carrying out the bulk of 4% cuts that Gov. Brian Kemp ordered earlier this year for the current state budget, before coronavirus was ever an issue. But the shortfall will likely force officials to tap into the state's roughly $2.8 billion reserve fund to float the fiscal 2020 budget until July 1, Farr said.
   
 "We basically start spending out of the rainy day fund to make up for the lack of revenue," Farr said Thursday.
   
 Appropriations chiefs urged calm and courage as lawmakers hash out the budget. Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Blake Tillery, who assumed the role following the death of former budget guru Sen. Jack Hill last month, said Georgia's budget experts have already set to figuring out solutions.
   
 "We're in a time that's going to require a lot of us to pull together and work together," said Tillery, R-Vidalia.

"C'mon Paula. Using intuition to rebuild my business?" Yessiree.
 Intuitive intelligence, alchemy and the application of esoteric principles in business for kick-derriere results is my super power. What better time to reunite with the power of intuitive intelligence than now? This pandemic will facilitate a new breed of business owners. But the skills you'll need aren't in a book, because mapping intuition in business for results hasn't been written yet. Basta, doomsayers. The world isn't ending. We'll rally. We'll reorganize. And we'll rebuild in a new way.
 Think Henry Ford, Elon Musk, Estee Lauder, Debbie Fields (cookies, yum) and everyone in between. You, like them, have a direct personal link to intuitive intelligence to download Eureka! ideas, to receive solutions and to build your version of an empire. Why listen to people who've never run a lemonade stand when you can partner with an intuitive guide and reclaim control? I know. Using intuition to rebuild your business sounds like the wackiest idea ever. Got it. There are concrete, operational and pragmatic steps to building a profitable business. I do it. Keep reading, this'll make sense. First, why is getting quiet important?
 1\. To establish a clear intuitive connection for your custom-made guidance, get quiet. It's essential. How else can you hear the messages from the still authority within? Distractions and the racket of daily life cause static in the intuitive line. Ah-no. You don't have to sign up for monk classes at a monastery. But does the clanging of millions of opinions help your business? Or do they confuse an issue?
 Intuitive masters know the importance of quieting the constant external din, most of it negative and designed to propagate paralyzing fear. So, by silencing the thoughts of the lower, limited mind, accurate guidance appears. In business, when does silence serve your highest good? Some say, always. Especially in the gap, after you've taken in external information and before making a major decision. Disclaimer. There's an acquired skill in recognizing the difference between intuition and the ego masquerading as one. Knowing which voice is which is your gold.
 2\. You. Intuition. Your business. Think about it. Your mind is the receiving station for intuitive intelligence. It may be old news but the truth forevermore is that this intelligence is the source of billion-dollar ideas. It's the reservoir that holds every solution. This field of intelligence fuels inventors, to build a better mouse trap and to design find-a-need-and-fill-it solutions pitch worthy of VC, Angel or Shark Tank investors. Aside from being a comprehensive intuition manual, Simone Wright, in First Intelligence, nails it on creative power, "Be calm in your heart. This is the most powerful understanding you must carry with you when developing your intuitive intelligence. A calm and peaceful heart creates a calm and peaceful mind, and a calm mind is the center of all creative power." Meaning, a calm mind is the conduit to intuitive intelligence and creative power. Maintain it, and you align with possibilities, solutions and ideas unique to you. Because that's where your version of a business and success begins.
 Mapping intuition to business for a result could be chapter five in my book for reasons you'll learn later. Meanwhile monkey mind, shush. Spend time in solitude. Every. Day. Let the message from intuitive intelligence emerge. See it in your mind's eye. Feel it deep in your core. And if you ever think life or business is doomed, full-stop. Redirect focus. Transform the energy to promote life. Then recite, "Just when the caterpillar thought the world would end, it became a butterfly."

In the first hour of economics class, one learns that demand drives supply in a free market society. If enough people want to have breakfast in the evening, restaurants will make it available. This is universally understood to be a good thing. But supply can also drive demand. This is may not be a good thing. If you increase the number of lawyers in an area, you are likely to have more litigation, but not necessarily more justice.
   
 Supply driving demand in criminal justice creates one of those rare public policy issues where both progressives and conservative stalwarts, like the Koch Brothers Foundation, find common ground. If you do nothing but build more prisons, you are going to encourage more incarceration and longer sentences. This can move a non-violent offender in the direction of becoming a career criminal.
   
 Even Mental Health can be adversely affected by supply driving demand. Intellectual Development Disorder (IDD) in children is characterized by deficits in mental functioning such as reasoning, planning, and judgment. Dr. Ed Hammer, retired Professor of Pediatrics at Texas Tech Health Sciences Center, tells me that when additional facilities for treating IDD came on board, there was increased pressure to apply this diagnosis to children who might have otherwise avoided such a label. In some cases, the diagnosis might have sent some children down a residential treatment path that was not to their ultimate benefit, as they were channeled toward using the newly available capacity.
   
 Let's look at how supply driving demand applies to higher education. The national pool of candidates for college admission is shrinking due to historically low birthrates. If the supply of universities places significantly exceeds demand, institutions will have to relax their admission criteria to stay competitive. They will also have to remove financial barriers to attendance with everything from increased Pell grants to the more extreme "Free College for All" ideas currently filling the campaign trail.
   
 If colleges do succeed in filling seats with less qualified candidates, they will be forced to compromise their level of academic rigor to meet these students where they are. If they don't, they will have even more unacceptable non-completion and time-to-completion rates. This will affect all students at an institution, as the classroom discourse will have to be targeted for a lesser level of student preparation. It will also increase the likelihood that students will graduate with fewer marketable skills.
   
 New employers would then face an inflated number of applicants with college degrees. Those degrees would not guarantee that the graduates could do the things that employers need done. Since employers would still rather have a college grad than a high school grad, those without college degrees would now be excluded from competition from jobs for which they previously might have been considered. Lack of confidence in the skill levels of new hires on the part of employers would depress entry-level salaries. Less rigorous college degrees simply would not have the same dollar value on the market. This benefits no one except the marginal colleges that get to stay open. It is particularly disadvantageous to the high-quality student who would have willingly demonstrated excellence in a more demanding college program, if they had had the opportunity.
   
 If there were fewer institutions, each degree would be worth more and be more meaningful to potential employers. It would also reduce taxpayer expense in both the cost of providing undergraduate programs and from government-insured student loans in default.
   
 The problem with reducing the number of public colleges is Reverse NIMBY. If any state wants to build a halfway house for drug addicts, just about everybody will agree that such facilities are needed but may still say "Not In My Back Yard" (NIMBY). If any state sees the need to reduce the number of colleges and universities, citizens are likely to applaud the concept, but engage in special pleading for why the one in their backyard must be spared (Reverse NIMBY). This is only natural in light of the economic benefit a locality gets from its public institutions of higher learning.
   
 Clearly, any program of closings must be methodical and cautious, because it is always easier to close an institution than it would be to bring it back again if needs change. A great deal of attention would need to be paid to how existing facilities could be transitioned to other uses. Appropriate steps must be considered to ameliorate the economic impact on employee families. The most important state responsibility would be to provide for the technical job training needs of those young people for whom the streamlined university system might be a poor fit. They should not and cannot be abandoned.
   
 Closing any public facility, be it an outdated elementary school or a military base, is never easy, but sometimes it is necessary for the greater good. Of course, the benefit to the public of initiating discussions about consolidation would begin long before any actual list would be drawn up, since each institution would likely pay unprecedented attention to its own quality and efficiency in hope of avoiding the list.

The big secret about this week's 50-for-50 profile Theresa Smith is she is just one person. With all she did in nearly 25 years as the athletic department administrator for Plymouth North and Plymouth South, you could have sworn she was actually a twin or even a triplet.
 "Name a game in Plymouth, either regular season or a big playoff contest, where she wasn't there making sure things ran smoothly. It's hard to do," said retired Athletic Director Karl Braun. "Terry was absolutely incredible with all the things she did that were outside of her job description and she did every one of those things for the same reason: she did it for the kids.
 "She never did things for the credit. Everything Terry did was for our athletes."
 Smith passed away in 2014 at the age of 69 after a short illness. Originally from Somerville, Theresa and he husband Thomas "Smitty" Smith moved down to Plymouth and made a home, raising their four children in town.
 "I will always remember mom and dad going to one game or another as a child. Our car was always filled with kids on the way to a practice or a game," said their son, Gary. "They were heavily involved Plymouth Babe Ruth and Plymouth Youth Hockey, and whenever somebody needed something they were always there to help out. You never even had to ask. They were always there to do what they could."
 Going above and beyond the call of duty was a daily happening with Smith. The different projects she completed on her own time are the stuff of legend.
 "She was always bringing uniforms home to be patched up or washed so the kids would look good when they played," Gary said. "I remember one time there was a bigger player on the football team and the school didn't have a uniform large enough for him. No problem. She brought home a couple shirts and used them to sew an extra panel into a shirt that fit him correctly so he could play."
 Plymouth Superintendent of Schools Gary Maestas said that story fits perfectly into Terry's giving profile.
 "Terry was kids first, always kids first. She was tremendously caring and compassionate and she always had the best interest of the student at heart," Maestas said. "You never had a ask Terry to do anything. Whatever you could come up with she had probably thought of it and done it already.
 "She was everyone's go-to person for anything involving athletics."
 Jim Kelley is a former high school coach in town and was part of the basketball table crew at Plymouth North for more than three decades. Over the years Kelley and his wife Eileen forged a long-standing friendship with Terry.
 "Terry was one of those people who did all of the work and wanted none of the credit. Between Babe Ruth baseball, youth hockey and sports at the high school she was involved in an incredible amount of things," Kelley remembered. "Everything she did was about helping the kids and every kid knew who she was because she was at all of their games."
 Braun said Smith "was always on top of her game" as an athletic administrator which made his job as an athletic director all that much easier.
 "Terry was incredible at her job. She trained all of the AD's she worked with on how to properly do their jobs," said Braun. "She was unbelievable. You never had to worry about a bus not showing up to take players to a road game and you always knew that there would be officials scheduled for your game because Terry made it happen."
 "And it wasn't just here in Plymouth," he added. "Other athletic directors from all over the place would call her if they had a question and she always had the right answer."
 And, added Braun, Terry wouldn't stop at the end of the normal work day.
 "She had a set of phone numbers and files at her home so she could deal with anything that might pop up at night when she was away from the office."
 Kim Wolcott (the reporter's wife) coached field hockey and softball at Plymouth North for 18 years. She formed a close friendship with Terry over that time.
 "When I started working at the high school as a substitute teacher (in 1993) Terry suggested I get involved by working athletic events. She showed me the ropes and became a incredible mentor and friend to me over the years that we worked together," Wolcott said. "I still work at athletic events today, and I always encourage new staff member to help out as a way to get involved in the school community because of how Terry showed me the importance of being involved.
 "Terry was a great friend and always went above and beyond to help the kids," Wolcott said. "We spent hours talking while selling and collecting tickets at the ice rink or at the football games."
 Although she did much of her work behind the scenes, Terry's good work did not go unnoticed.
 Wolcott and Plymouth South coaches Stephanie Finn and Summer Ivan combined to successfully nominate Smith for the Massachusetts Women in Athletics Distinguished Service Award in 2011.
 Terry was inducted into the Plymouth Athletic Hall of Fame in 2018.
 Each week during 2020, the 50-for-50 project will profile a Plymouth person or state championship team that positively impacted the town in the last 50 years. To nominate someone, email Sports Editor David Wolcott Jr. at dwolcott@wickedlocal.com with information on the nominee.

Murphy noted the orders carry a 90-day misdemeanor, which really isn‚Äôt much more than a traffic ticket or civil infraction. He stressed he‚Äôs not going to put his men and women in a position where they‚Äôre confronting people trying to enforce something that probably isn‚Äôt enforceable - and is about as low on the criminal scale as you can get. Murphy said if, and in his opinion when, the orders get overturned, then it will be his office and men and women who are on the hook and held liable for things like false arrest, false imprisonment and other law violations. Murphy added that would ultimately result in county taxpayers footing the legal bills for defending lawsuits. Murphy says at the end of the day, the businesses owners have to make a decision as do the patrons. He said someone who is immune compromised or more at risk is probably not going to be going be out at the gym or other businesses but staying at home so common sense has to come into play. Murphy added it does serve as a great reminder to use social distancing and review personal hygiene habits such as washing hands and keeping your hands away from your face. At the end of the day in his world, Murphy says they have to do what they are legally bound to do and he does not believe they are legally bound to do this. Murphy likened the situation to the legalization of recreational marijuana. He said once that passed, all charges in the pipeline stopped and he expects this will be the same. Murphy says once all of the executive orders are done and/or once the courts rule that the orders are not legal or at least the extension, then everything in the pipeline will stop. He reinforced that the courts are not going to be clogged up six months from now with hundreds of violations of executive orders when they have real business to get back to.

I have a clear memory of a particular grocery shopping experience with my mom when I was a small child. She had taken me to City Grocery down on the Square in my hometown of Wellington, Texas. This market wasn't large by today's standards. But from the perspective of a 3-year-old, it was a mega Walmart, so I was sure to keep mom in sight.
   
 Maybe it was the cookie aisle that distracted me, I'm not sure. I soon realized, to my horror, that I was following the wrong set of heels. That lady in front of me was not my momma.
   
 I don't remember exactly how it played out. My mom must've realized I wasn't behind her anymore, and things went Code Red for maybe 30 seconds. Happily, I made it out of City Grocery with the right mom and finished growing up with the right parents. But I remember that feeling of separation very well, and the joy of discovering she had not left me to fend for myself.
   
 Now I'm past 50 and still getting mixed up in stores. I also lose my car in the lot quite often. Worse yet, life in general sometimes perplexes me. But thanks to mom, I have an ability to navigate through most situations - a gift she gave me simply by being present and making me feel loved.
   
 I know there were times when it wasn't easy. My mom worked as a teacher for more than 30 years, and she gave those kids the same love and attention she gave us. She worked all day then came home to her own messy kids and bills spread out on the kitchen table. I'm not going to lie and say she always pulled it off like June Cleaver. But my mom kept at it year after year, as she still does, with love guiding her way.
   
 She has applied that same dogged determination to love and be present in everything she does. For the past 50 years she's played either the piano or organ for Sunday services at First Baptist Church in Wellington, not to mention countless funerals and weddings. She's been the secretary of the Wellington Ritz Theatre board of directors since its inception and has left an archive of the most perfectly crafted meeting minutes you will find anywhere in the country. I've suggested she cut back a little, ease up. Quit worrying over things so much. But as my dad used to say, "Katherine ain't got no quit."
   
 And speaking of Dad, we lost him on April 22, just a few short weeks ago. In the last year of his life, his mind and body were failing him. The cowboy who once got up before dawn without an alarm increasingly had to be awakened and reminded to put on his boots. We talked about care options outside the home, but mom wasn't going to have it. She dug in and took on the dual roles of nurse and drill sergeant, handing out the pills, keeping the doctor appointments and making sure he showed up to church in starched Wranglers and pearl snap shirts that he could put on by himself. She "encouraged" him to get up out of the chair and see people, even hauling him to movies down at the Ritz. She provided him a sense of normalcy that he would not have experienced had he been moved away from the house. If I ever suggested she might need help with all this, she'd always say "maybe later."
   
 I should've known she wouldn't give in easily. That's not who she is. Some might call it stubbornness, but I call it devotion. I want to be more like her, but I don't quite measure up yet. If nothing else, I can at least shine a little light on her and all the moms like her, thanking them for never giving up on us. Even if we get befuddled in City Grocery and lose our way on the cookie aisle, there's always a mom or mother figure, like my mom, who never quits loving us and who finds us when we're lost.

GALESBURG -- As Illinois remains shut down, Galesburg Mayor John Pritchard is among a group of mayors statewide to urge Gov. JB Pritzker to change his plans for reopening Illinois.
   
 Pritzker's plan for the state is set to allow regional re-opening for the state, which has been split into four regions, with Galesburg a part of the north central region, a large portion of the state's land which also contains Rockford, the Quad Cities, Macomb and Peoria.
   
 The five-phase plan currently has the entire state in its second phase, "flattening the curve." The third phase would bring opening to some children's programs, retailers with capacity restrictions, and non-essential offices, and Pritchard believes Galesburg and Knox County more or less would qualify to move on to this stage.
   
 To move on, new cases need to be at or under a 20% positivity rate and increase no more than 10 percentage points over 14 days. There must be no overall increase in hospital admissions for 28 days; ICU beds need to be occupied at a flattening or declining rate; and testing must be available to patients, health care workers, first responders, individuals with underlying conditions and residents and staff of congregate living facilities. Contact tracing must begin for confirmed cases within 24 hours of diagnoses.
   
 However, due to the 28-day stipulation association with hospital admissions, no region will actually be able to open until May 28 at the earliest, a point of contention for Pritchard and other state leaders, who argue they otherwise would be able to open much sooner.
   
 This stipulation comes because the state is only beginning to count days to move onto phase 3 on May 1, long after Illinois' stay-at-home order began March 21.
   
 According to Pritchard, Pritzker's plan is different from the one he and other Illinois mayors were told would be put into effect. A May 3 teleconference including Chicago Mayor Lorie Lightfoot had detailed tentative plans of Illinois being instead divided into seven districts. Pritchard says this caught state emergency management agencies "off guard."
   
 "I heard the department of health people are a little ticked," Pritchard said. "It forces them to restructure the way they do stuff."
   
 Besides the time constraint, the limited number of regions adds an additional hurdle for Knox County's reopen. The 20% positivity rate is something Pritchard says Knox County has been below for a long time. As of Saturday morning, the county's total positive rate is at 7.6%, but with the positive rate being factored daily based on new tests and results, it was 16.3% Friday. Even harder hit areas like Winnebago County have not had positive test rates over 18%.
   
 Other factors needed to move onto phase 3, such as the presence of available hospital beds and ventilators, would also be easily met by Knox County, where Pritchard says nobody is currently in the hospital with the coronavirus. As far as testing capacity, Pritchard says Knox County is also caught up in that area.
   
 With regions opening piece by piece, Pritchard is worried a longer opening will cause additional economic harm at a time when many county businesses are already in peril, and the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans which have been helping employers keep their staff will only last until June, according to Pritchard. The virus has brought forced closure to some businesses, and a decrease in business to others. Hospitals unable to do elective procedures until recently have had to furlough staff, and long established businesses and nonprofits are struggling.
   
 "Hospitals have no COVID patients, and they're only now being allowed to restart medical procedures that are life and death for some people," Pritchard said. "Of course, it was all done to prevent the medical community from being swathed by the wave, but the wave didn't happen."
   
 Pritchard believes this wave was avoided in part because of the stay-at-home order, which he believes did come at the right time given the information, but he still believes it's time to move on to the next phase and start reopening the county.
   
 With 1.9% of the county's population tested, is there enough data to yet make that determination? Pritchard says it is, and that testing has increased and will continue to increase.
   
 "My understanding is there is going to be a lot of testing going on between (Thursday) and Monday," he said, mentioning that everyone who works at Hill Correctional Center is being tested, and that workers at Smithfield Foods in Monmouth are all receiving access to voluntary testing.
   
 "I expect the positivity of those tests will be well under 20%," Pritchard said. "I was concerned a couple weeks ago that there had only been a couple hundred tests done, but really in the last seven to 10 days we added a lot of tests, so I'm comfortable with the testing (numbers)."
   
 Pritchard says a reopen for the community would not come without precautions, and he believes the precautions people took to protect themselves and others is another reason a large wave of cases did not happen. Precautions regarding face masks, social distancing, washing hands and "other basic things" like that will persist.
   
 "You go to a Hy-Vee or Walmart or Lowe's, clearly we have a lot of people out and in fairly close contact, but because they're taking those precautions, the virus spread has been very limited so far," he said. "I believe if we're cautious going forward, we can carefully allow certain businesses to open in a planned basis, and do it without creating this wave that overwhelms us."
   
 Pritchard isn't acting alone in his messaging for the governor. He says he borrowed parts of his letter's points from Quincy Mayor Kyle Moore. For now, in Galesburg, Pritchard plans to start coordinating with business leaders and Ken Springer of the Knox County Area Partnership for Economic Development for a plan on how to reopen the county.
   
 Whether these efforts and those by leaders in other downstate regions will bring a change to the state's approach is yet to be seen.

His administration has shown that it has the right idea by modernising its operations, moving towards privatisation and refurbishing its training ground, but they are yet to win over one of its biggest components; its fanbase. In a country where fan loyalty is mostly secured by winning matches and silverware, it does not take much for the Red Giants supporters (or what is left of them after the fall from grace) to turn on their team and stop attending matches. He may have the right ideas, but Tengku Amir's administration needs to do more to convince the fans that every defeat, hiccup or misstep is a part and parcel of the rebuilding process, instead of a sign of a doomed transformation mission.

 Community deserves answers in Arbery case
   
 Excerpted from The Brunswick News
   
 Gov. Brian Kemp and Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr finally understand the gravity of a festering situation in this coastal city. Seventy-plus days after the shooting death of a young man in Satilla Shores by two men who were chasing him, there are still more questions than answers.
   
 A number of questions stand out above the others. Why, for example, did a father and his adult son think it was OK to arm themselves, jump in a pickup truck and chase down a jogger they wrongly assessed to be a burglar? The question becomes even trickier when noting the father was a former police officer and a retired investigator with the local district attorney's office, his son a former Coast Guardsman.
   
 Certainly they, perhaps more than others, knew the potential danger and risk of their aggressive action.
   
 Those taking to the streets to express frustration against what had been a lack of movement in this casehave every right to be upset. When authorities remain mum, it appears progress is at a standstill, even if it's not. Suddenly a situation that is already intolerable becomes more intolerable. Even ordinarily peaceful citizens will begin to lose their cool then and take to the streets.
   
 Community and state leaders, as well as church ministers and chamber of commerce heads, are publicly letting the frustrated among us know they do not stand alone. They, too, are demanding justice. This lengthening list, in addition to the governor and attorney general, includes Brunswick Mayor Cornell Harvey, Glynn County Commissioner Allen Booker and U.S. Sen. Kelly Loeffler.
   
 Demonstrators are exercising their right to express their dismay with the investigation up to now, but they are doing it while remaining calm. Not only is that a sign of respect for the memory of Ahmaud Arbery and his family, but it's part of the very makeup of the demonstrators themselves. It's who they are.
   
 They want justice, not hostility.

 Governors, mayors should communicate on reopening plans
   
 Excerpted from The Chattanooga Free-Press
   
 It would be nice for us to snap our fingers and return the country to the place it was before anyone heard of the COVID-19 virus.
   
 That, of course, is impossible.
   
 But as the country emerges from the fallout of the global pandemic, states, counties and cities are forming their own plans to reopen their economies. Normally, we would expect no less. We say we don't want the federal government to dictate too much to us, so significant powers are delegated to the individual states, according to the Constitution.
   
 Yet all counties and cities aren't the same, so we don't expect states to treat them the same, especially where it comes to their economies, the populations those economies serve and the amount of virus in those counties.
   
 But until today Tennessee, Hamilton County and Chattanooga were mixed up in a cauldron of what can open, what can't and who's in charge here. We wish there had been more communication.
   
 It all began when Gov. Bill Lee -- based on scientific data his administration relied on -- said he would let his previous stay-at-home order to expire on April 30. In doing so, he said restaurants and stores could open this week with restrictions on capacity and continued suggestions for social distancing, masks and hand-washing. Lee said his new orders applied to 89 of the 95 counties but that larger counties with their own health departments -- including Hamilton -- could proceed with their own reopening plans.
   
 Hamilton County Mayor Jim Coppinger said he would go along with the governor's guidance and allow those establishments in the county to reopen, but Chattanooga Mayor Andy Berke said he did not plan to follow suit. He said he and the mayors of the state's three other largest cities would determine when their restaurants and stores would open based on advice of their Big Four Economic Restart Task Force.
   
 However, a spokesman for Lee indicated orders by county health departments in the six larger counties would be the rule, thus superseding Berke and the other big-city mayors. Yet a spokesman for the local health department when asked about the situation deferred to Coppinger, who had said he would follow the governor's guidance.
   
 Berke, cognizant of the additional information from the governor's office, said the city would "obey the law" but added he didn't think it would allow citizens to feel as safe as they should feel.
   
 We would have preferred the Lee administration to have conferred with the mayors ahead of time so the confusion wouldn't have ensued, but an attorney general's opinion makes it clear the governor through the county health departments has the final word.
   
 Going forward, we believe what individuals should do comes down to common sense. With no vaccine available, senior citizens and people with compromised health should stay at home as much as possible. Social distancing and the avoidance of handshakes and hugs still should be the rule of thumb for the time being.
   
 Now, as things move beyond the initial reopenings, assuming no resurgence of the virus occurs, we hope the governor, the Hamilton County mayor and the Chattanooga mayor will work off the same page, even if they can't agree on every detail.

"In the letter to Enbridge, the state made clear that it was going to apply environmental standards in evaluating the permit," he points out.
