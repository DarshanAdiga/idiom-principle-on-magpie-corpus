Meanwhile residents of the small Oregon town of Phoenix, near the California state line along Interstate 5, walked through a scene of devastation after one of the state’s many wildfires wiped out much of their community. A mobile home park, houses and businesses were burned, leaving twisted remains on charred ground.
 Many of the residents were immigrants, with few resources to draw on.
 Artemio Guterrez stood helplessly next to his pick-up, surveying the rubble of his mobile home. His children sat quietly in the truck bed and waited for him to salvage what he could. He was able to find a ceramic pot with a smiley face on it, some charred miniature houses from a Christmas-themed village and a cross that formed when two pieces of glass melted together.
 Guterrez, a single father of four, had been at work at a vineyard nearby when he saw thick smoke spreading through Rogue River Valley. He raced home just in time to snatch his kids from the trailer park where they live alongside dozens of other Mexican families. They got out with just the clothes on their back.
 “I’m going to start all over again. It’s not easy but it’s not impossible either. You have to be a little tough in situations like this,” said Guterrez, who had just returned from his mother’s funeral in Mexico. Entire mobile home parks with many units occupied by Mexican immigrants who worked in nearby vineyards or doing construction were reduced to ash in Phoenix and nearby Talent.
 “We’re kind of like a family. We’ve known each other for years, since we came here or even before then,” Guterrez said of his neighbors at Talent Mobile Estates. “We’re living day by day.”
 As the fire approached Phoenix, Jonathan Weir defied evacuation orders, even as flames 30 feet (9 meters) high shot from trees. Fearing for his life, he drove his car to the entrance of a nearby mobile home park, where his tires began melting. His home was destroyed as the fire hopscotched through the town of 4,000 residents.
 “There were flames across the street from me, flames to the right of me, flames to the left of me. I just watched everything burn,” Weir told a reporter.
 The Federal Emergency Management Agency estimated that 600 homes were burned by the fire that started in Ashland and tore through Phoenix, the Mail Tribune of Medford reported.
 Oregon officials haven’t released an exact death count for the wildfires but at least four fatalities have been reported in the state. One person was killed in wildfires in Washington.
 Oregon officials were shocked by the number of simultaneous fires, which stood at 37 Thursday, according to the state Office of Emergency Management.
 Gov. Kate Brown said more than 900,000 acres (364,000 hectares) — greater than the size of Rhode Island — have burned in Oregon in the past three days — nearly double the territory that burns in a typical year.
 Back in Phoenix, Marty Curtis considered herself lucky. Her house was spared and she escaped with her cat, Louie.
 “You could see the flames. You could hear things popping — gas tanks and propane tanks exploding,” she said. “I have my house. I have my life. I have my cat and I have my job — and right now, that’s all I need.”

Colchester elected to bat first after winning the toss and posted a score of 178-9 with Joe MacGregor (90) leading the way before Hornchurch were bowled out for 138.
 “Saturday was a funny one. For the first time I was really happy with our bowling and our fielding. We actually did really well all weekend,” added Gordon, who led his side to an Essex League treble in 2018.
 “Saturday we were let down with the bat and we had a few dodgy decisions go against us, but that’s what you have to get on with. Although we weren’t good enough with the bat, so we can’t make too many excuses.”
 They secured a 40-run victory over Hadleigh as they posted 164-4 in 20 overs with Merv Westfield (68) top scoring, before bowling their opponents out for 124.
 “Sunday was good, it was a terrible wicket over there, so we struggled at first, to be fair. But Roy Smith and Merv Westfield came in and their partnership won us the game,” said Gordon.
 “They were brilliant, it suited that type of batsman. More of a stroke player wasn’t any good on that wicket.
 “We started well, we were always well ahead of the game, we had a good couple of cameos at the end.”

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Attorneys for four former Minneapolis officers charged in the death of George Floyd say that each client should get his own trial, as the officers try to diminish their roles in the Black man’s death by pointing fingers at one another. A hearing is scheduled for Friday to address several issues, including whether there will be a joint trial in the case. Other issues that will be argued include defense requests to move the trial away from Minneapolis. Floyd, who was Black, died May 25 after Derek Chauvin pressed his knee against Floyd’s neck. Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder and other counts, and three other officers are charged with aiding and abetting.

Gaa said between salaries and expenses for personal protective equipment, plastic barriers and other unbudgeted expenses, the city should hit its full $6.4 million.
 The Sioux Falls City Council heard a proposal recently to take its budget savings and pay down three outstanding loans. Sioux Falls qualified for $41.5 million in CARES act funding. No decision was made at the time the idea was presented.
 Gaa said he's not keen on using funds for general debt reduction in Aberdeen, but he did say he will likely have a plan before the council in the next 30 to 60 days. In general, he said, one logical move is to set aside some of the funds for future expenses related to personal protective equipment and unanticipated COVID-19 related expenses.
 He also said another option would be to use the funding in those parts of the budget that saw CARES act funding relief. As an example, he said, the police and fire department budgets will see salaries reimbursed through the CARES act, so, maybe there's another part of those budgets that could benefit, like, for instance, using a portion to pay down debt on a fire truck.
 All reimbursement requests are subject to state and federal review, Gaa said. To date, he said, the city hasn't gone through the reimbursement request process for qualified expenses.

DETROIT (AP) — For the second time this month, Hyundai is telling some SUV owners to park outdoors because an electrical short in a computer can cause vehicles to catch fire. The Korean automaker is recalling about 180,000 Tucson SUVs in the U.S. from 2019 through 2021 to fix the problem. The company says corrosion can cause a short circuit in defective anti-lock brake circuit boards that can start a fire. Hyundai says it knows of a dozen engine fires from the problem but no injuries. Hyundai says if the anti-lock brake warning light comes on, the vehicles should not be driven and owners should contact a dealer and disconnect the positive cable on the battery. Hyundai will notify owners around Oct. 30. Dealers will replace the anti-lock brake control computers.

We have all watched the steady march of progressive sexual morality for decades, and we have seen one moral boundary after another knocked down on the most illusory and disingenuous grounds. The steps from _Obergefell_ to _Bostock_ were incredibly swift. And as California proposes lowering the age of consent to fourteen, and as groups such as MAPs (“Minor Attracted Persons”) lobby for pedophilia as a sexual orientation that deserves inclusion in the LGBT community and protection under the law, many are intuitively ready to draw the line. Dawn Hawkins, executive director of the National Center on Sexual Exploitation, has done so, stating that “‘Cuties’ clearly sexualizes children, and in particular, girls of color. The pornography industry is built on these stereotypes, and Netflix is taking a page from this playbook by featuring these children in such a manner. Netflix must stop this practice immediately.”      A petition to remove the film is circulating. It states precisely what the film’s defenders deny, namely that _Cuties_ sexualizes an eleven-year-old girl “for the viewing pleasure of pedophiles,” and “negatively influences our children.” Might a sensitive, sophisticated viewing of _Cuties_ offer us a different perspective on the film? Perhaps. Some might even convince us that the film condemns the very thing the public is outraged about. We are perfectly capable of telling ourselves that by watching an orgy in Kubrick’s _Eyes Wide Shut_ we are really studying “the wages of sin.” We are also perfectly capable, like Lot, of offering up our daughters in order to keep the peace.      Yet the hundreds of thousands of signatures on that petition suggest the world that has made a habit of “pushing the boundaries” no longer has our trust. Jeffrey Epstein was a regular at Harvard and Hollywood, Aspen and Sundance. I can readily imagine him funding an R-rated film about the sexual awakening of a child as cultural criticism and sophisticated art in the tradition of Nabokov’s _Lolita_. We must guard our senses. We must guard our children. We must watch out for that road paved with the best of intentions. Like the medievals, we must recover the sense that  _curiositas_  is a sin. We do not need to see all things. Lest Sodom and Gomorrah’s fate of “sulfur and fire” await us, perhaps we could at least agree to forego watching eleven-year-olds “twerking.”

 The Harrow Lodge outfit will make the short trip to local rivals Harold Wood on Saturday for their final Shepherd Neame Essex League fixture of the shortened season before heading to Chelmer Park the following day.
 And they will be keen to finish the campaign strongly and bag themselves a spot in the cup final to extend their campaign.
 “Hopefully we can finish with a win, but the more important game is on Sunday to be fair, and it would be nice to finish the season with a cup win,” Gordon said.
 “I think T20 suits our team well. It’s going to be tough as Chelmsford are always a good side, especially on their home ground. But hopefully we can turn up get to the final then you never know what can happen in T20. A couple of early wickets changes the game massively.”
 Hornchurch head into the busy weekend on the back of mixed fortunes as they lost by 40 runs to Colchester & East Essex in the league before a T20 quarter- final win over Hadleigh.

AN amateur goalkeeper who injured a big toe while playing footgolf - football played to the rules of golf - has been awarded damages in the Circuit Civil Court against the owner of the Co Dublin course. Stuart O'Dwyer of Glenhill Avenue, Finglas, Dublin 11, and Leinster Senior League goalkeeper for Glasnevin FC, told Judge John O'Connor he had been injured while kicking the ball out of the rough in a round of footgolf with his father.Mr O'Dwyer, who successfully sued Simon Rutledgge of the White House pub restaurant, New Park, The Ward, Co Dublin, said his right foot had hit a metal stake concealed by long grass just off the 10th green at Mr Rutledge's course. He said he was a patron of the White House premises.Barrister Laurence Masterson told the court that Mr O'Dwyer's claim for damages for personal injuries against Mr Rutledge had been undefended. He said Mr O'Dwyer had been injured in the footgolf game on June 14, 2018.Mr Masterson, who appeared with Francis Callaghan of Spelman Callaghan Solicitors for Mr O'Dwyer, said judgment had been marked by the County Registrar against Mr Rutledge in the absence of an appearance in the case.GrassMr O'Dwyer told Judge O'Connor he played in goal for Glasnevin FC at Leinster Senior League level.On the day of the game with his father he had kicked the ball off the 10th tee into very long grass. As he tried to kick the ball onto the nearby green his foot crashed into the metal spike that had been firmly driven into the ground and which was concealed in the grass.He had injured the big toe on his right foot and had to go to accident and emergency department of James Connolly Memorial Hospital, Blanchardstown, following the game. He was treated by Mr JA McKeever, consultant in emergency medicine, who diagnosed a soft-tissue injury.The court heard that Mr O'Dwyer had lost the nail on his big toe and he had been left with a mild deformity in the shape of a small lump on the toe after the nail had grown back.He told Mr Masterson he had suffered severe pain, discomfort and bruising in his toe which had been splinted with a buddy strap in the hospital where he had been given crutches. He did not have to miss work and was not making any claim for lost earnings.Mr O'Dwyer said he had joined members of his family 10 days after the accident on a pre-booked holiday to Florida and while his injury had not ruined the trip, he had suffered some pain and discomfort. His injury had cleared up after about nine months.Judge O'Connor said he felt compensation would fall in at the lower end of the Circuit Court jurisdiction.He awarded Mr O'Dwyer €16,000 damages and Circuit Court legal costs against Mr Rutledge who was not in court, nor legally represented.The judge, on foot of the original judgment, had been asked to assess damages against Mr Rutledge.
