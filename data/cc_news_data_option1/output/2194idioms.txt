The airline industry needs to add 2 million daily travelers to break even with the numbers reported last year, which goes on to highlight that recovery is a long way off. Even though American Airlines is planning to operate 55% of its scheduled flights in July, this doesn't mean that the company will carry 55% of passengers it carried in the previous year. There is pent-up demand, I agree, but social distancing policies and other preventive health measures that are expected to remain in place through the end of this year are likely to become a massive obstacle for American Airlines in filling the seats of these flights, which is altogether forgotten by some investors.
 Zapwater Communications recently conducted a survey of 1,280 Americans and found that only 39% of respondents plan to take a trip within the first six months after travel restrictions are lifted. Something is better than nothing, but there's no reason for investors to be excited about these numbers. In fact, this confirms the fact that returning to normalcy is miles away. In a bid to fill the seats, American Airlines will likely offer discounted prices to popular destinations, which is not going to help the margins of the company. I prefer investing in companies that have some sort of pricing power over their products and services, and I believe airlines will be using aggressive pricing mechanisms to attract travelers, which is not something appealing to me.
 Second, the possibility of a second wave of infections creates uncertainty regarding this pick-up in demand. What happened in South Korea when the government decided to open night clubs serves as a reminder that Covid-19 is still well-and-truly active. To refresh your memory on this, South Korea had to shut down the reopened businesses within just a few days as the country reported a spike in new cases linked to the reopening of clubs. Things have taken a similar turn in Iran following the decision to ease mobility restrictions as well. The same way it would have been disastrous to believe the novel coronavirus would never enter the United States, not factoring in the probability of a second wave of Covid-19 might lead to disappointing returns. Dr. Anthony Fauci warned on May 27 that irresponsible behavior will certainly trigger another wave of infections as the United States is not out of the woods yet.

“We have the beautiful advantage of the Sunset Plaza, so we are able to space out the tables dramatically,” said Carmela Sanna, special events director at La Piazza del Villaggio and La Pizzeria. “We’re pretty lucky to have big spaces. We had a great night last night at the Pizzeria and La Piazza. We’re trying to be as cautious as we can. Paolo and Stefano (the owners) have done a lot these last weeks building up to the reopening, working behind the scenes to make sure we’re up to date with everything.”
 The Italian restaurateurs have combined the two restaurants’ menus and created a “distanza unita,” or united-in-distancing approach as part of ongoing efforts to make sure that both staff and customers feel comfortable and are complying with guidelines.
 “Let’s show the world that we can be safe and we’re doing the right thing of what our county has implemented,” Sanna said. “We are really strict about it in the restaurant. We all have to do the right thing.”
 Another Mountain Village eatery, the Shake N Dog Grub Shack, has reopened for business while “following all guidelines set forth by the county, town of Mountain Village and our health inspector,” and by adding supplemental precautions, according to Shake N Dog owner Stanya Gorriaz.
 “We are fortunate to be set up as more of a take-out model overall and as such our outdoor dining tables have been getting a lot of use throughout the COVID-19 crisis,” Gorriaz said. “Our restaurant is situated with some fabulous views in Mountain Village so guests continue to enjoy the opportunity to grab a bite, sit outside and soak up the sun and scenery.”

It is equally important to reflect on the question of whether racist people - especially racist whites - are the enemy in all of this. Here, we must distinguish between racists that exist in our daily life and the system and structure in place that produce racists and even enable them to operate and practice racism with little or no consequences. In this sense, I argue that white racists, as many as we have these days emboldened by a president elected in their own image, should not be our focus. Rather, the focus should be on the system and the structures in place that are producing and enabling such individuals. Being of Middle Eastern background and observing how the entire system in place works hard to represent Middle Easterners as the “enemy” or as “terrorists”, I learned that _people will practice racism and hate simply because they can or because they know that they can get away with it_. They will think twice about it if there are serious legal protections that impose serious consequences on them for doing so. Apparently, for some reason, our system of governance insists on denying this protection for people of color and other marginalized folks, while we know it has been successful in granting it for other minorities who used to be discriminated against in America in the past. We need to ask why and how we can change this. Keeping our focus on racist individuals is not only futile, but it also spends a precious energy that we need to direct at changing the entire structure and the system in place as we have it.

Still, times are hard for those in the restaurant business, despite the phased reopening. With the gondola closed until June 15, as well as the ski resort’s bike park, despite observations of increasing visitors and part-time residents in Mountain Village, the resurgence of tourism has felt sluggish to some.
 “Frankly, the Village Core is difficult to find and access for tourists without the gondola transportation, and there is not much to do for visitors if they are able to find a way there,” Gorriaz said. “With restaurants and businesses now open, competition for the few and far between guests that do visit the area is fierce as there just aren’t enough customers to go around right now. We are hopeful that the reopening of the gondola and area activities will provide much needed relief for all business owners in Mountain Village working hard to stay open for our community.”
 Sanna, of La Piazza and La Pizzeria, agreed that the current levels of patronage are not viable from a business perspective over the long run.
 “We feel that the quicker we all get into the space where we know we’re safe and we’re very respectful of our coworkers and clients, I think people will feel more comfortable. But viability? No,” she said. “In the month of June, realistically, we’re not having Bluegrass, we’re not having Wine Festival, we’re not having these festivals; most weddings have canceled. We’re not going to have the numbers anyway, so let’s make who’s here happy.”
 Other eateries now open in Mountain Village include El Rhino Taco and Coffee Bar, Telluride Coffee Company, Tracks, Telluride Distilling Company, and the Village Market. Poachers Pub is set to open Monday, June 8, with the Village Table opening Wednesday. In addition to limited indoor seating, diners are welcome to take to-go orders, including alcoholic beverages from licensed establishments, to enjoy in common consumption areas such as the Village Core, Sunset Plaza and the Village Pond Plaza.

As McDonald noted in his memo to council, “ … the ROW (right of way), street and sidewalk widths tend to be narrower off Colorado Ave., and there is greater variation in slope and cross-slope conditions, in off-Colorado locations and responses may be unique and case-by-case as singular approaches may not be practicable.”
 Among considerations was a potential loss of parking, should pedestrian traffic be diverted from sidewalks given over to dining or retail and into areas currently used for parking.
 Town officials expressed concern about anticipated vehicular traffic this summer. Members of the marketing and airline travel sectors have indicated sharply decreased flight bookings and visitor projections that will pale in comparison to a typical summer normally filled with festivals, events and weddings. That will, they’ve said, result in more people driving to the county, rather than flying.
 “We’re expecting heavy traffic flow,” said Telluride Chief Marshal Josh Comte. He also expressed concerns about emergency access should side streets be closed to vehicular traffic or refigured into one-way streets. And with Colorado Avenue becoming one-way eastbound only, Comte anticipated ancillary impacts.

Hawley’s proposal would fundamentally alter business models of social media companies that today depend on huge volumes of user-generated content. But it certainly will not solve the problem of fake news, which has emerged as an increasingly controversial flashpoint in the discussion on how to regulate social media. The problem with Hawley’s proposal is that it could potentially require digital platforms to engage in further content moderation. Ironically, then, efforts to retain the platform’s political neutrality could well create disincentives against moderation and in fact encourage platforms to err on the side of extremism (which might inadvertently include the dissemination of misinformation).

These positive developments will only improve the market sentiment toward travel stocks, and American Airlines stock will likely report more gains in the short term.
 ## Takeaway
 The rally in American Airlines stock does not make much sense to me from a fundamental perspective. This is driven more by the improving sentiment than the numbers itself. The path to recovery may have already begun but this is going to be a very bumpy ride. Second-quarter numbers are likely to disappoint investors as well. Liquidity concerns might resurface in the future as American Airlines is sitting on many cancellation requests. The quarantine policies imposed by many nations for international travelers will push many travelers to wait for a better time to explore the world as well, which is an unforeseen risk by some investors. Even on the back of improving sentiment and some positive developments, I have decided to remain on the sidelines as I believe there will be little improvement in earnings as a result of all these positive trends. I am comfortable with missing some short-term gains in the hopes of getting it right in the long run.

 Pakistan's economy was in tatters even before the emergence of coronavirus in the country, but the pandemic has added to the South Asian country's economic woes.
 Nearly 90,000 people have been tested positive for the virus, with over 1,800 related deaths. The country has recorded a huge spike in COVID-19 cases since Prime Minister Imran Khan's government lifted lockdown restrictions in mid- May.

 Khan insists the revival of the economy is more important than containing the coronavirus spread.
 "Unfortunately, the [previous] lockdown has already hit the poor people. We no longer can afford that," Khan told media in the capital Islamabad. "Therefore, except for a few sectors, all other sectors will stay open," Khan recently said, adding that the government wants to "save people from coronavirus and hunger simultaneously."
 "Coronavirus is going nowhere, at least this year. That means we have to live with it following safety guidelines," Khan said.
 But in order to revive the economy, Khan's government is shifting the onus to the private sector, which experts say could result in thousands of public job cuts.

It’s not necessarily my 365-day trip that is what people want but the fact that I am following my heart and being true to myself. My dream of traveling the world for an entire year is important to me, but it is my dream, and you have your own dream. Maybe it is similar, but maybe it’s different.

However, in order to sustain ourselves in the long run, we must position the company as a smaller more nimble operation. Accordingly, we have taken and are taking steps to reduce our cost base in many areas including reducing our fixed cost infrastructure, such as the recently announced transition of printing of the Virginian-Pilot from our plant to an outside printer; reducing our real estate footprint by ending or restructuring leases and monetizing our owned properties; reducing compensation by flattening our management organization; reducing headcount; eliminating incentive and discretionary bonuses; and implementing pay reductions and furloughs. Many of these changes were introduced late in the first quarter thereafter, so we have not yet seen the full benefit of these and many other profitability actions we have taken.

Now we come to unpacking the language used to describing the demonstrations and resistance to racism in America. As noted earlier, words like “thugs”, “violence”, “chaos”; comments like “all lives matter”, “they are racist, too”, and such language have been circulating all over the place. Here we need to understand that _the first and foremost danger of using such a language is that the language itself serves as a tool to further segregate people_. Drawing once again from Claudia Rankine’s insights, she intelligently captures this problematic issue as she writes, “Perhaps the most insidious and least understood form of segregation is that of the word.” In this sense, people using the language above are making a clear statement by segregating (and distancing) themselves from the protestors and their just causes. Precisely for that reason, we need to unpack the language by putting it under the microscope.

Same applies to the use of the word “thug”, which, interestingly, is defined in the dictionary as “a violent person, especially a criminal.” Moreover, the etymology of the word has a colonial origin as it was first used by the British colonizers in India and has since been appropriated and used in many contexts in which people around the world resisted colonial powers. Indeed, in many cases, whenever colonizers didn’t approve of a resistance movement or revolution, they called its members “thugs”. Megan Garber writes on the problematic use of this epithet and the way in which it has “undergone the classic cycle of de- and re- and re-re-appropriation appropriated since it was first coined.” She goes on to write how to “dismiss someone as a ‘thug’ is also to dismiss his or her claims to outrage.” This is precisely how the word is being applied in the context of the Black rage America is witnessing these days. Likewise, protesters are being accused of creating “chaos”. It is important for us to be critical about the malice the use of this word carries. First, it denies protestors their right to express outrage and seek justice. Second, implied in it is that those who don’t approve of the protesters – the racists and those who love the status quo – are actually the holders to the keys to law and order. In reality, if we think critically, this could be totally reversed in that those using the word are people who refuse to see any order in place other than that created and imposed by them. They are people for whom anything that is not under their control is considered chaotic. It is perhaps quite sobering to realize how some philosophers have thought about “chaos”. Two notable examples that come to mind are the Spanish philosopher, George Santayana, who wrote “Chaos is a name for any order that produces confusion in our minds.” In other words, just because my mind can’t see the order in something, that doesn’t necessarily make it chaotic. The second comes from the exiled Romanian philosopher, Emil Cioran, who wrote, “Chaos is rejecting all you have learned. Chaos is being yourself.” I wish to think of the demonstrations as rejecting everything we have been taught and starting a new chapter; indeed, starting to write a new book!

"Be not forgetful to entertain strangers, for there are those have entertained angels unaware." Those are people who go the extra mile for a stranger, then proceed on their way. They never expect a "thank you" or public recognition for their actions; they sometimes do not even know they did a remarkable thing.

 The first time, I was perhaps 11 years old -- too big to go on our daily evening car trips around the mountain. The whole family -- Daddy, Mother, Mike, Becky and I -- would pile into our Dodge and ride from Cabot Avenue in the Mill Village to Attalla, go right on Main Street, continue till we reached the turnoff at the foot of the mountain.
   
 Then on to Noccalula Falls, down the mountain and turn onto Cabot Avenue. The little ones were asleep by then; I pretended to be. It was an effective way to end our day.
   
 This night, I refused to go. The sun was still bright outside, I didn't think about how quickly darkness falls.
   
 After a few minutes of presenting my case, the car rolled off and I strolled to the end of the driveway. What should I do first? Playing on the swing set took about five minutes, climbing the chinaberry tree took another 10. The evening shadows were getting long across the porch; the breeze seemed cooler.
   
 I went inside to get a sweater. The darkness enveloped the back of the house; a soft noise was rhythmically bumping in the darkness; darkness was quickly settling over the kitchen and creeping into the living room.
   
 I dove into the sofa and covered my eyes with my hands. The noise from the bedroom droned tonelessly, like the music from a horror movie. The darkness, the darkness -- at that moment, I felt arms gently enfold me -- holding me, comforting me in a way that I've felt again. However, that was the first time I knew that there was something -- and, later in my life, someone -- who would never leave me.
   
 The Dodge's headlights illuminated the driveway. Everyone was home! The floor fan that had been left running made the bumping sound; nature caused the darkness. But I never mentioned the comforting arms that snuggled me and made the fear go away.
   
 Until today, when darkness threatens our safety, when greed takes the place of generosity; when fear grips us and will not allow us to watch the news; when we digress to the generational safety of "Andy Griffith" and "I Love Lucy" and long for another time. We must remember that the arms that held our forebears are still here. The nail-scarred hands will carry us; there is room in those arms for us, 'Round Town.

But Collins' decision to not appear with him publicly showcases the fears moderate Senate Republicans facing re-election have, especially in light of Trump's controversial moves this week.
 The president was widely criticized for his decision to walk across Lafayette park Monday night and pose with a Bible in front of St. John's chuch just minutes after a peaceful protest was dispersed by police using force.
 But even before Trump made that move, he was at odds with Mills, who was on the president's call with governors earlier Monday.
 She told the president that if he came to her state he would cause 'security problems.'
 The president responded by telling Mills the White House would 'look into that,' adding that he would bring out 'a tremendous crowd' in the Democrat's state.

Last week, 20 leaders responsible for 85 percent of the world's economy and two-thirds of the population gathered at the G-20 Summit in Buenos Aires. The stage was set to decide on a better way forward on matters like international trade, the global economy, and food security. So, you know, just another Friday.
 Climate change was an important topic on this year's agenda, which comes on the heels of an ominous climate report by the United Nations and the World Meteorological Organization's announcement that the average global temperature for 2018 will likely be the fourth highest on record, and 20 of the world's warmest years happened in the last 22 years. If that wasn't bad enough, the top four warmest years happened over the last four years.
 Host President Argentina's Mauricio Macri kicked off the summit by announcing, "I am an optimist"—and there were certainly some positive strides made at the gathering. One of the most notable being an agreement by 19 nations (the United States is the only one that didn't sign on) to uphold the Paris Climate Agreement and "continue to tackle climate change while promoting sustainable development and economic growth."
 If you're shaking your head that President Trump still isn't on board with the accord, know that the U.S. at least agreed to sign on to a measure to support clean energy initiatives that reads, "We recognize the crucial role of energy in helping shape our shared future, and we encourage energy transitions that combine growth with decreasing greenhouse gas emissions toward cleaner, more flexible and transparent systems, and cooperation in energy efficiency."
 Every signee has a different role to play, and the nitty-gritty of _how_ they will work to keep global warming to under 2 degrees Celsius compared to preindustrial levels is the source of conversation at the COP24 climate talks, which just kicked off in Katowice, Poland, and will go on until December 14. (Yep, it's a big time for climate policy right now—and you can follow along with it here.)
 "The upcoming climate talks are the most important round of negotiations since the Paris Agreement was reached three years ago," Lou Leonard, the World Wildlife Fund's senior vice president for climate change and energy, told CNBC of the talks that gather thousands of world leaders, activists, and policymakers to flesh out a framework for the Paris Climate Agreement. 2018 is the year the countries committed to putting a plan in place for carrying out the agreement, so time is running out.
 Many experts are saying that the Paris Agreement isn't nearly aggressive enough, especially considering the extreme weather events that prove that we are already facing the forceful and frightening effects of global warming. Ahead of the meeting, leaders from 16 European countries called for more aggressive policies to combat climate change, which they refer to as "the key challenge of our time." Now, it's all eyes on Poland.

In fact, anecdotal evidence shows that employers are not even doing such a good job now, even with this incentive.

Meanwhile, for those employers who do take their responsibility seriously, McConnell’s bill undercuts them. Its message is: don’t be a chump and worry about Covid-19; you’re in the clear.

ROMA (ITALPRESS) - Il presidente del Consiglio Italiano Giuseppe Conte e il primo ministro spagnolo Pedro Sanchez hanno scritto una lettera alla presidente della Commissione europea Ursula von der Leyen per chiedere che vengano al più presto eliminati i controlli alle frontiere tra i Paesi dell'Unione, e che questo avvenga "in modo coordinato, non discriminatorio e in base a criteri epidemiologici chiari e trasparenti". Per Conte e Sanchez "la libertà di movimento è un elemento fondamentale del progetto europeo".   Secondo i due premier "è necessario stabilire criteri sanitari comuni in tutta la Ue per i trasporti, con protocolli concordati tra tutti i Paesi". Inoltre "molti dei nostri Stati membri - scrivono Conte e Sanchez - si avvicinano alla data decisa per la riapertura delle loro frontiere alla mobilità turistica. Da come questo processo verrà portato a termine dipenderà la percezione che i nostri cittadini avranno del ruolo centrale dell'Unione Europea in tutta questa crisi".   (ITALPRESS).

By the same token, social media companies cannot solve this problem simply by making themselves the final arbiter of fact-checking, as opposed to an independent regulatory body. Twitter attaching a fact check to a tweet from President Trump looks like a self-serving attempt to forestall a more substantial regulatory effort. Even under the generous assumption that social media giants had the financial resources, knowledge, or people to do this correctly, as a general principle, it is not a good idea to let the principal actors of an industry regulate themselves, especially when that arbiter is effectively one person, as is the case at Facebook. As Atlantic columnist Zeynep Tufekci wrote recently, “Facebook’s young CEO is an emperor of information who decides rules of amplification and access to speech for billions of people, simply due to the way ownership of Facebook shares are structured: Zuckerberg personally controls 60 percent of the voting power.” At least Zuckerberg (unlike Twitter’s Jack Dorsey) has personally acknowledged that “Facebook shouldn’t be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online… Private companies probably shouldn’t be, especially these platform companies, shouldn’t be in the position of doing that.”

We might say that there were two ways of understanding broad, social phenomena including whole social systems. We can understand them by their structure or we can understand them by their origin. This goes for capitalism and the class struggle inherent to it. When we speak of ‘systemic racism,’ for example, we might examine its brutal or subtle complexities across social life – patriarchy, family, schools, housing, work, shopping, play, art, science, what-have-you - and then determine how such structures are functional, or not, to the accumulation of capital. Or, we might investigate historical origins, how various social institutions (say, the prison) or economic behaviors (say, the labor market) are created and might form patterns across time. The durability of structures, if not their form, can be a function of time. Temporality always, necessarily implies an end. This latter mode of investigation provides depth to the freedom struggle. These thoughts come to mind with the police murder of George Floyd and the demonstrations and riots protesting it in particular and the racist criminal justice system in general.

“Many physicians were inappropriately giving antibiotics because, honestly, they had limited choices,” she said.
 Now that the initial, terrifying flood of patients in hard-hit cities has subsided, doctors across the United States are seeking to draw lessons from their overuse of antibiotics, a practice that can spur resistance to the lifesaving drugs as bacteria mutate and outsmart the drugs.
 Many critically ill patients on ventilators have developed serious secondary infections. But widespread fears that coronavirus patients were especially susceptible to drug-resistant infections — a concern first described in studies from China — appear to have been misguided, according to interviews with researchers and more than a dozen doctors who have been treating patients with COVID-19.
 “The fears turned out to be overblown,” said Dr. Bruce Farber, chief of infectious diseases at Northwell Health, which has cared for thousands of coronavirus patients at its 23 hospitals in New York.
 For many doctors, the pandemic not only provides lessons about the judicious use of antibiotics, but it also highlights another global health threat that has been playing out in slow motion: the mounting threat of antimicrobial resistance that annually claims 700,000 lives as the world’s arsenal of antibiotics and antifungal medication lose their ability to vanquish dangerous pathogens.
 In recent weeks, doctors, researchers and public health experts have been trying to turn the pandemic into a teaching moment. They warn that the same governmental inaction that helped foster the rapid, worldwide spread of the coronavirus may spur an even deadlier epidemic of drug-resistant infections that the United Nations suggests may kill 10 million by 2050 if serious action isn’t taken.
 Without new antibiotics, routine surgical procedures like knee replacements and cesarean sections could become unacceptably risky, and the ensuing health crisis could spur an economic downturn to rival the global financial meltdown of 2008, the U.N. report, released last year, said.
 “If there’s anything that this COVID-19 pandemic has taught the world, it is that being prepared is more cost-effective in the long run,” said Dr. Jeffrey R. Strich, a researcher at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center and an author of a study published Thursday in Lancet Infectious Diseases that seeks to quantify the growing need for new antibiotics to treat drug-resistant infections. “Antimicrobial resistance is a problem we cannot afford to ignore.”
 The pipeline for new antimicrobial drugs has become perilously dry. Over the past year, three American antibiotic developers with promising drugs have gone out of business, most of the world’s pharmaceutical giants have abandoned the field, and many of the remaining antibiotic startups in the United States are facing an uncertain future.
 Such dreary financial realities are driving away investors at a time when new antimicrobial drugs are urgently needed.
 “I’m worried the remaining small biotech companies won’t be here this time next year,” said Greg Frank, director of Working to Fight AMR, an advocacy group funded by the pharmaceutical industry. “The longer we wait, the deeper in the hole we’re in and the more expensive it’s going to be to solve the problem.”
 The crisis, many experts say, calls for robust government intervention. In a report published in March, the U.S. Government Accountability Office documented a piecemeal federal response to antimicrobial resistance and said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was hobbled in addressing the problem by a lack of basic data about drug-resistant infections. As an example, it noted that the CDC tracks less than 2% of the country’s annual half-million cases of drug-resistant gonorrhea. The data doesn’t even include cases affecting women.

That still would mandate changes being initiated by Congress. As things stand today, existing legal guidelines for digital platforms in the U.S. fall under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. The goal of that legislation was to establish some guidelines for digital platforms in light of the jumble of (often conflicting) pre-existing case law that had arisen well before we had the internet. The legislation broadly immunizes internet platforms from any liability as a publisher or speaker for third-party content. By contrast, a platform that publishes digitally can still be held liable for its own content, of course. So, a newspaper such as the New York Times or an online publication such as the Daily Beast could still be held liable for one of its own articles online, but not for its comments section.

We might think of _luck_ as gratitude's seedier sister. In liberal society her associations are unsavory: the tackiness of gambling, lotto tickets, self- interested social climbing and escaping a hangover after excessive drinking. New Agers, whose commitment to spiritual transformation I share, disparage the term for different reasons. I gather that thinking in terms of luck negates one's own intrinsic goodness and deservingness of the abundance offered freely by the Universe. Though I, too, thirst for the well of spiritual wisdom, oftentimes translation of that wisdom into the bourgeois neoliberal idiom turns it into another form of obedience to the ongoing destructive capitalist order. In the white bourgeois world, where everyone's born – or _elects_ to have been born - _at least_ on second base, ( a stroke of luck that must ever be denied), the downgrading of luck fits easily into the social convention (in many ways a fantasy) of upward mobility. In this context, where actual luck is denied, deservingness of life's goods functions eerily like the puritanical sense of being among the predestined chosen.
