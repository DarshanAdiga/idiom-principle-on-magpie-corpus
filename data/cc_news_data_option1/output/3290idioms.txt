As students returned to class this week in Onslow County's public schools with some in-person instruction, school officials said they'll continue the current opening plan as long as it is safe for the students and staff to do so.


   


  No clusters of COVID-19 cases had been reported as the Onslow school district moved into a second day with school facilities open, but as schools and colleges operate amid a coronavirus pandemic questions remain about how long in-person instruction will last.


   


  Plans had already changed for some college students a week into classes due to COVID-19 concerns.


   


  UNC-Chapel Hill reversed course after welcoming students back to campus and announced Monday its moving to all online courses Aug. 19 due to an increase in positive COVID-19 cases among students.


   


  Locally, Onslow County Schools leaders hope to stay the course.


   


  Onslow County Board of Education Chairwoman Pam Thomas said they believe in- person instruction works best for students but schools are operating in an unprecedented time and situations are constantly changing.


   


  Onslow County Schools opened with a blend of online and in-person instruction for most students and others enrolled in the new Onslow Virtual School, which provides an all-online platform.


   


  "This is a day-by-day decision," Thomas said. "We pray for the best that we can keep in-person instruction but will do whatever we have to do to keep our students, teachers and staff safe."


   


  At the heart of the decisions will be the monitoring of any COVID-19 cases among students and staff.


   


  Onslow County Schools Chief Communications Officer Brent Anderson said the daily screenings of students and staff - including temperature checks and a check of symptoms of illness - are the "first line of defense" in slowing the spread of the virus.


   


  "In the event of a confirmed case at school, OCS will work closely with (the health department) and follow guidance and procedures outlined by state and local public health officials," Anderson said. "Our local health department will handle the contact tracing process in a confidential manner and collaborate with OCS on how to address the situation. Individuals identified as close contacts will be notified of any potential exposure, in order to make them aware of the need to isolate (per requirements) and to let them know they will be contacted by the health department for next steps."


   


  How much information is shared publicly depends on the situation.


   


  "Any additional information will be shared on a case-by-case basis based on the impact to the school's instructional program and maintaining the student and staff confidentiality," Anderson said.


   


  Prior to the start of the school year for students, an individual at Heritage Elementary tested positive for COVID-19 and the school community was notified due to "potential instructional impact."


   


  Anderson didn't provide further details but said the individual was never in contact with students.


   


  "Due to the potential instructional impact from a report of a COVID-positive individual at Heritage Elementary School, we felt it prudent to notify the school community of the situation to address any concerns parents might have had on the first day of school," he said.


   


  While many universities and many colleges have been reporting numbers of COVID-19 tests and positive cases on their campuses, Anderson said it different for K12 schools.


   


  "These numbers come from information collected through their student health services. OCS does not have this capability and will not be reporting total numbers of cases or how many students/staff are out due to a positive diagnosis or because of identification as a close contact," Anderson said.


   


  The Onslow County Health Department said they will report any clusters in outbreaks in schools, which is defined as a minimum of five laboratory confirmed cases with illness onsets or initial positive results within a 14-day period and plausible epidemiologic linkage between cases.


   


  "The Onslow County Health Department has and will continue working closely with Onslow County Schools to provide guidance on COVID-19," said OCHD spokeswoman Victoria Reyes. "The Health Department will report any reportable clusters in outbreaks at the schools, but will not report on individual cases that do not add up to a cluster or outbreak in order to comply with HIPAA laws."


   


  The state updates information ongoing clusters among schools on Tuesday and Friday on its COVID-19 dashboard.

Many gathered on July 19 in front of Delano City Hall for a vigil. The theme "United To End Violence" has been the sentiment of not only the residents of Delano, but of the neighboring communities of Earlimart, McFarland, Richgrove, etc. Parents, friends and family members of victims of crime came together for support and shared their stories, hoping someone in the community will come forward with information of the person(s) responsible for the death of their children.


  These senseless shootings are unacceptable. I remind our community members that there are grieving parents, grandparents, brothers, sisters, uncles, aunts, cousins and friends of these victims. We need to let these grieving families know they are not forgotten. I, too, am one who grieves due to my son being shot and killed on Jan. 31. I wake up every morning to this nightmare. At the time of this writing, it has been over six months since his murder. Four other of his friends were shot but survived. I'm thankful they are alive. I can identify with the ongoing grief other parents are going through who have had their child die at the hands of a senseless shooter.


  Residents in each community want an end to violence and stand united for justice for their loved one. There are several unsolved cases currently under investigation. Such crimes take time to solve. I've been patient. But we as a community can be proactive by speaking out for those victims who can not speak for themselves.


  There will be another vigil for these victims of crime. We must do this for those who didn't deserve to die due to a senseless shooting. The next vigil is set for Sunday, Sept. 20, at 7:00 p.m. All families affected by such a tragedy are asked to meet in front of Delano City Hall that evening. We ask all community members equally concerned over these senseless shootings to be in attendance, standing united with us to end violence.


  Those planning to attend are asked to abide by social distancing guidelines and to bring your mask and a chair. Be sure to wear a T-shirt of your loved one, if you have one. We also ask for each family member to bring a large portrait of their loved one to display during the vigil. You'll hear from family members of victims asking for justice. You'll also hear from officials who share in this concern. We have a strong supportive community along with our neighboring communities. Someone we know and love needs justice. Enough is enough. We want safe communities for our children to live in.


  Someone out there knows who took the life of our children. Never again on earth will we hear from our loved one who lost their life due to a senseless shooting. Victims' families are devastated knowing they've been robbed of a precious life. If you're reading this and know the person(s) responsible for these shootings, do the right thing and call anonymously the investigators at 661-721-3369. May God give you the courage to do so.

Sen. Kamala Harris officially accepted her historic vice presidential nomination on a night filled with heavy hitters at the DNC. The most talked- about words came from former President Barack Obama, who set aside an unwritten presidential rule to not directly attack the current officeholder and unleashed a scathing rebuke of President Trump's governance. Obama said he'd hoped Trump would take the presidency seriously and develop "some reverence" for democracy. But, Obama said, "He never did." Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Hillary Clinton also spoke during the third night of the virtual event, with the latter issuing a strong warning to voters to make their voices heard. "Don't forget: Joe and Kamala can win 3 million more votes and still lose," Clinton said. "Take it from me."

Gateway reached 200 megawatts commissioned on August 1 and added 30 megawatts more by Monday afternoon to deliver extra peak power for the heat wave, King said in an interview with GTM. The facility will expand to three hours of duration next summer and four-hour duration later on.


  The developer didn't plan on the construction wrapping up in the midst of a historic power supply crunch, King said. LS Power began work on it five years ago, in response to California's surging solar generation and decision to shut down gas plants that used ocean water for cooling. Back then, nobody had built batteries anywhere near this kind of scale.


  "Battery storage, when we started, was very expensive," King said. "It wasn't clear, exactly, that it would work, but when you're in development you've got to look forward a little."


  The company's 40-megawatt Vista Project came online in 2018, in time for that year's heat wave and price spikes, which provided more data for the business case. LS Power shored up Gateway's business plan by selling energy products to power retailers and community choice aggregators, King said. One type of product involves the customer providing surplus midday power, with Gateway promising to store and return that power in the evening, insulating the customer from price spikes.


  When California regulators ordered the utilities last fall to obtain more capacity, Gateway won Resource Adequacy contracts with Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison. Those obligations kick in late next year.


  "We built Gateway as a shorter duration project, but we built it so we had room in the buildings... to expand that capacity when we had customers for that capacity," King said.


  LS Power hired NEC Energy Solutions to integrate the Gateway project, which uses battery cells manufactured by LG Chem. A time-lapse video shows the warehouse-like structure popping up at East Otay Mesa between September 2019 and July 2020.

It’s not out of the question for the government to make use of existing anti- monopoly laws to prevent more mega-mergers, says Teachout — or indeed to break up some of the giant corporations that are extinguishing choice and relentlessly squeezing money out of workers and small businesses.


  “There’s a reason the Sherman [Anti-Monopoly] Act is a criminal act,” she says, noting that early in American history, “people talked about monopoly as a form of theft because they saw it as basically a highway robber standing at a choke point and taking value from the people who are creating value.”


  As with the case of presidential emoluments, Teachout may be a little early on her timing. But she's giving us an early warning about a problem society needs to fix.

You may think you know Watertown, but have you walked every street? Rounded every block? In the span of 10 days, 20-year-old Noah Ferraresso walked every inch of the town.


  Ferraresso graduated from Watertown High School in 2019 and completed a post- graduate year at the Tremont School during the 2019-2020 school year. Like many people in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, he found himself with more time on his hands than usual. As an avid walker, he decided to spend his extra time exploring the streets of Watertown. It was suggested by a neighbor that he expand his journey to the entirety of Watertown and he decided that it was the perfect quest.


  His interest and inspiration stemmed from two men who walked every street of New York City. One of those men is Matt Green, whose eight-year-long journey was captured in the documentary "The World Before Your Feet." The other man was William Helmreich, a sociologist and professor, who passed away due to COVID-19 in late March. His passing served as extra motivation for Ferraresso, who wanted to honor Helmreich's legacy with a walking journey of his own.


  Ferraresso is on the autism spectrum which, he explained, has aided him on his walking journey because of his knack for maps.


  "I remember maps," Ferraresso said, "I know [the maps of] not just Watertown but also other surrounding neighborhoods by heart."


  With the help of his mental GPS, Ferraresso was able to separate the city into 10 sections that he then conquered. His adventure to all corners of the town led Ferraresso to encounter many friends, new and old. He was especially excited to run into old Watertown High classmates and teachers, all of whom applauded his efforts and often stopped to take a socially distant photo.


  Even with his extensive knowledge of the city, Ferraresso is careful about what days he selects to embark on a walk: "I walk on the best day according to the humidity or weather. When the temperature is in the mid or high 70s, that is the best time to go."


  Although Ferraresso carefully plans the time of his excursion, he still sets out prepared for any obstacle or emergency that may come his way. In his backpack he carries a water bottle, a fully charged phone with an extra wireless charger, hand sanitizer, and, of course, his mask.


  He is also equipped with a brace on each knee. Ferraresso has a congenital diagnosis in his knees which causes him pain from time to time, but he has not let it slow him down. In fact, despite all the obstacles, Ferraresso is going above and beyond his original goal of walking every street in Watertown.


  Since completing that original mission, he has started to explore neighborhoods in surrounding towns and cities, including Belmont, Waltham, Newton, and Boston.


  In a time when many people feel limited in what they can do, Ferraresso has found meaningful alternatives to normal routines.


  "I learned that despite the pandemic, I can still be out and about and accomplish not just walking goals, but other academic goals. And I have created and learned every step of the way," he said.
