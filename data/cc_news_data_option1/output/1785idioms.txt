Betfair Ambassador Rivaldo says Barca's La Liga campaign could suffer if games are played behind closed doors and encourages his compatriot Allan to join Everton... It seems likely that La Liga will resume at the start of June and many players are already preparing to start training again with their teams. All of the matches should be played behind closed doors without any fans in the stands. Barcelona have 13 wins and just one draw against Real Madrid in their home matches in La Liga, so the Barca obviously benefit from playing in front of their fans. It might turn out to be bad for the club to play in an empty Camp Nou in their quest for another Spanish title. Playing without fans is a totally different experience for the players and tends to benefit the visitors, but a team that wants to be crowned champion must adapt to the difficulties. After all, the other clubs will have the same handicap in their home games. Physical recovery could be key and make differences At a time in which most of the European leagues are seriously considering their returns it's normal that the players have concerns about it, especially about their physical conditions. After almost two months training at home without the best conditions many of them need some time to recover their best form. If the leagues don't give them enough time, some players might have problems to get back to their usual football immediately. In those circumstances, it's probable that some players will reach their peak level earlier than others and that might play an important role in this final section of the season. There's nothing players and clubs can do about that except work to adapt quickly and efficiently before competition resumes. Another question that will certainly be on players' minds is their health - as Sergio Augero said when he expressed concerns - because many countries are still battling against a strong virus. I believe that all clubs have good medical staff and rules will be in place to eliminate almost any risk to the players. I believe that players will be frequently tested for Covid-19 and will not be susceptible to considerable social contact. Yep, there is not a vaccine yet, and the players may be a little nervous about it, but they should have all the care needed and all should be fine. Small squad could make things tougher for Quique Setien Barcelona decided to sell some players in the last transfer window and, Luis Suarez and Ousmane Dembélé's both injured, the club has a fairly small squad. That could prove to be a problem when they face a busy schedule in the next few months, with at least two matches per week. But this is a special situation that no one could envisage a few months ago, so Barça's manager must manage his squad carefully in this decisive phase of the season and probably appeal to some young players from La Masia if needed. This will create problems to Quique Setien, but I'm convinced that Barça has quality in their academy and excellent players in the first team. Despite the predictable difficulties they face, I still think Barcelona has the qualities to retain their Spanish title. Courtois comments are normal Real Madrid Belgian goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois has said in an interview that it would be unfair to crown Barcelona as champions before the end of the season as Madrid haven't lost any games against Barca this season and even won one of them in La Liga. Those are perfectly normal comments for me, coming from a player fighting for the Spanish title and who knows that in normal circumstances there will be many more matches to play until the end of season and time to reverse their current two-point deficit. There's no team looking to climb places in the table that wouldn't feel bad if the season ended earlier than expected. So there is no problem with Courtois expressing his opinion. The best case scenario is that the clubs will be able to finish the season and the new champions will be crowned then. In France's Ligue 1 they decided to award PSG with another title, but the club was way ahead in the table and it would have been almost impossible for them to lose the title. That was an easy decision. In the Netherlands' Eredivisie things were tougher because there was a fight at the top of the table and the league preferred to cancel the season without crowning a champion. These are always tough situations to make. I believe that, if the authorities have the pandemic under control and authorize matches it will be much better to play the rest of the season to keep the sport's integrity intact. But first, of course you must ensure that there will be no danger in going forward with the matches. Allan should take advantage of Carlo Ancelotti's confidence Brazilian defensive midfielder Allan is being linked with a potential move to Everton after making a good impact in Italy with Napoli. Carlo Ancelotti, who managed him at Napoli, wants to work with him again in the Premier League. I think Allan should take this chance to play in what is, for me, the best league in the world. He is a good player who might be useful for Everton. The move would also give him more visibility as he tries to get some more selections for the national team ahead of the Copa America in 2021 and World Cup in 2022. Having the confidence of Ancelotti is something to be proud of and I'm sure Allan will take this chance of jumping to a more competitive league if the clubs can reach an agreement.

This adjusted index responds to the criticism that you would expect average hamburger prices to be cheaper in poor countries than in rich ones because labor costs are lower. PPP signs where exchange rates should be on track in the long term, as a country like China grows rich, but says little about today's equilibrium rate. The relationship between prices and GDP per person may be a better guide to the current fair value of a currency. The adjusted index uses the "best-fit line" between Big Mac prices and GDP per person for 48 countries (plus the euro area). The difference between the price predicted by the red line for each country, given its income per person, and its real price gives a disproportionate measure of undervaluation and overvaluation of the currency.

Why is it important to demonstrate that you are a risk taker? It is because it shows that you are not afraid to make mistakes or failure. It shows that even if you do make mistakes (which you most definitely will) you will turn those mistakes into lessons and avoid making the same mistake again in the future. You want to demonstrate a time when something went wrong, and you made a huge mistake now what makes you stand out against others is how did you handle the situation? You want to show that you were able to accept the mistakes you made but then turned the whole situation around and made it into something you learned from. This demonstrates an extremely positive attitude and shows you are able to handle working under pressure and accepting when things do ultimately go wrong. Making mistakes is an excellent way to grow as a person and helps you in the long run in becoming even more successful. So show this off to your potential employers!

HOLLAND -- Walking golf courses has been no issue for Holland High School golfer Daniel Castaneda.
   
 Nine holes, 18 -- even 27. He doesn't mind.
   
 "I've been walking since mid-March, so I'm just used to it by now," Castaneda said. "It's not too bad. Nine holes isn't bad -- I've walked 27 holes in one day a week and a half ago. I went 18 then I went to the range for a little bit because I worked on my tee shots and then I came back and did another nine."
   
 Castaneda, a junior, has been keeping busy practicing his golf game during the Michigan lock down.
   
 "It's like the one thing I can do that's allowed," Castaneda said.
   
 The junior averaged a 45 as a sophomore last year for the Dutch boys golf team and had a high-game of 40, leading to Holland Sentinel All-Area Team honors.
   
 "Daniel is a student of the game," Holland coach Jason Voss said. "He is always trying to become a better person and golfer on and off the course. I expected a great year out of Daniel with all the offseason work that he was putting in. His knowledge of the course and managing his shots from tee to green would have allowed him to achieve his goals of lowering his scores from week to week."
   
 Castaneda said with all of the work he has been putting in, last year's numbers are no longer representative of his current ability.
   
 "It was pretty crazy," Castaneda said of the season cancellation. "I knew I was going to keep on being on my grind, keep on going everyday because I'm still going to have tournaments this summer. It stinks, but I'm still going to have a chance to show what I can do this summer.
   
 "Last year, I was not playing to my caliber of player."
   
 His goal this year was to average at least a 39, and had conference and state recognition in mind. He joined the American Junior Golf Association (AJGA) and colleges have already gotten his phone number from his resume on the AJGA website.
   
 "Talking to other players, they always tell me it's the No. 1 way to get into colleges and get my name out there," Castaneda said. "My parents signed me up for that and had a couple of tournaments I was signed up for."
   
 He plans to put up golf-swing videos on the site as well.
   
 A member at Clearbrook Golf Course in Saugatuck, Castaneda has been golfing consistently with fellow Dutch golfer Chandler DeWitt.
   
 He plans to keep doing so until things go back to normal.
   
 "I've played every day for the past two weeks, but right now I'm giving myself a three or four day break, just so my body rests for a bit, but then I'll get back into it for the next couple weeks," he said.

ZEELAND -- The city of Zeeland is launching a farmers market of its own, with opening day scheduled for Saturday, May 23.
   
 The market will be held at the lot at the corner of Elm Street and Cherry Street, directly across from Zeeland City Hall, every Saturday morning during the summer months.
   
 Tracee Geurink, who is managing the farmers market for the city, said she and her husband had been vendors at a small seasonal farmers market organized by Rustiek, a home decor shop downtown Zeeland.
   
 "(Rustiek) did it for two or three years, and then they were going to stop doing it, and that's when I went and asked if the city would have any interest in it," Geurink said.
   
 Rustiek's owner Diane Byker said in a Facebook post that she had decided to close Rustiek's downtown storefront, but the business will continue with online sales.
   
 "(A farmers market) is something we've tossed around, had on the back burner, but it never really went forward," said Kerri VanDorp, events coordinator for the city of Zeeland. "Community members had expressed interest in it, so we knew there would be interest."
   
 Geurink's farm, Maple Hill Beef, and Visser Farms are the two confirmed vendors for opening day so far. A strawberry farm has also signed up to sell once strawberry season rolls around.
   
 Farmers markets are permitted under the governor's stay-at-home orders, but while current orders are still in place the market will be limited to selling food and plants. The governor's directives also permit the sale of pet food and personal hygiene products at farmers markets, although no vendors are expected to be selling those items at Zeeland's market as of yet.
   
 VanDorp explained the market will have several measures in place to ensure the safety of vendors and shoppers, including hand sanitizing stations and 6-foot markings on the ground to promote social distancing.
   
 Geurink said the hope is to grow the market into a consistent source Zeeland residents can count on for locally-grown, locally-produced food.
   
 With grocery stores still struggling to align their supply chains with the demand of families eating at home, Geurink said it seems like a perfect time to be able to offer people a place to buy fresh, local food.
   
 Holland's farmers market is set to open Wednesday, May 13, with similar measures being taken to keep shoppers safe.
   
 "In no way is it to be a competitive thing with Holland's market," VanDorp said. "Their market is exceptional and they do what they do incredibly well. What we're doing is what we do well, which is the small town niche."

While families and individuals in need suffer throughout the year, the impact of the global COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic has magnified hardships, placing many in dire situations.
 "Never has there been a more critical time to support those in need," said Kim Stewart, chairman of the Scituate Community Christmas Board of Directors. "Our goal is to help fulfill the most critical and fundamental needs of our community, primarily to provide food, cover expenses including utilities and rent, and ensure the most vulnerable among us - children, the elderly and the sick - are protected."
 The generous support of the Scituate community during this time when a vast amount of businesses are closed and people are out of work has allowed Scituate Community Christmas to successfully assist people in many different ways, including helping single mothers with groceries and household supplies.
 "One was forced to start using her savings to pay for food before we were able to lend a hand," Stewart said.
 SCC has also given games, books and crafts to 70 students on free/reduced lunch to inspire creativity and reduce anxiety during this pandemic.
 Additionally, SCC has purchased and delivered two essential kitchen appliances to families in crisis; crafted and delivered postcards to veterans offering assistance; purchased and delivered meals to more than 20 veterans; shopped and delivered groceries for seniors with special dietary needs; and provided gas gift cards to help a family with a sick infant get into Boston for critical appointments.
 The organization has also offered the Susan Phippen House as the base of operations for the Collective Response and Mutual Aid Initiative in response to the COVID-19 global pandemic.
 "As our namesake implies, many continue to be under the impression that we are exclusively dedicated to serving those during Christmastime - a misnomer we are working hard to clarify," said SCC Board Member Sarah Murray. "While the annual 'Big Give' at Christmas is a hallmark of our organization, the truth is we are committed to year round giving because serving those in need transcends the 'most wonderful time of the year.' As the needs of our community grew year after year beyond Christmas, we realized we had a unique opportunity to extend a helping hand throughout the year."
 The organization has kept the Scituate Community Christmas name because it pays homage to the organization's founder, Susan Phippen. The name also represents SCC's history in serving Scituate families, and reflects its roots fulfilling Christmas wishes.
 "But our mission over the last three decades has expanded," Murray said.
 SCC serves as a bridge for those suffering a hardship - offering support and assistance to folks as they navigate the fallout from a devastating health diagnosis, long term sickness, painful divorce, unexpected tragedy, or devastating job loss.
 "The impact of these events can have a profound effect on families and individuals," Murray said. "Knowing this, we quietly extend our support to the community throughout the year through simple yet essential acts of kindness and generosity."
 Despite the increase in need, Stewart said SCC's volunteer pool "remains steady with those ready to chip in, roll up their sleeves and support friends and neighbors during this difficult and uncertain time."
 As a trusted resource for the community for the last 30 years, SCC is well positioned to continue in its mission to offer support and assistance for those suffering through this pandemic and beyond, Stewart said.
 "With a committed and hardworking board of directors and a vibrant community of volunteers, we look forward to continuing to instill the spirit of kindness, generosity and volunteerism in our community for years to come."
 In a time of social distancing restrictions, SCC is taking every precaution to ensure the safety of the volunteers and the recipients.
 "We're following the guidelines for social distancing as outlined by the CDC," Stewart said. "Safety is our number one goal and we have successfully supported our community throughout this pandemic without incident."
 The sensitivities of those suffering hardship, and the importance of confidentiality, are well understood by the volunteers at SCC.
 "We have always been respectful of families and individuals and never share personal information," Stewart said. "Those that come to Scituate Community Christmas for support can rest assured that they will be treated with respect, and trust us to quietly provide help during a difficult time."
 Susan Phippen, a trailblazer and trusted leader, had a vision for Scituate Community Christmas more than 30 years ago - to support families during times of hardship while inspiring the values of kindness, compassion, philanthropy and volunteerism, said Jill Cuomo, vice chairman of the SCC Board of Directors.
 "We are so grateful to continue to deliver on her vision and expand the opportunity for giving beyond our wildest dreams," Cuomo said.
 This is due in large part to the overwhelmingly generous community here in Scituate, she added.
 "The outpouring of support we have felt throughout the year, but especially in the last few weeks amid this pandemic, has truly demonstrated our community's shared mission to help provide a bridge for our friends and neighbors in need. We encourage you to reach out if you need help or know of a family or individual who could use a little extra support now or in the future. We are here to offer a helping hand, 365 days a year."

Few plants can rival the spectacular floral displays that are seen in azaleas (Rhododendron). The profusion of flowers, the vivid colors that are available, and their adaptability to different soil and climates makes them one of the most popular shrubs that we grow. It would not be springtime without azaleas, and this is especially true in the Southeast.      Most well-established neighborhoods with their large trees are the ideal cover for these lovely plants, giving them the dappled shade they need and the leaf litter and pine needles that azaleas appreciate. They have been bred for hundreds of years and there are more than 10,000 different cultivars of these lovely plants. Although most people associate azaleas with spring, some bloom in summer and fall. By carefully selecting plants, you can have azaleas blooming at least eight months of the year.      To keep these plants looking pretty and blooming their heads off, one needs to do some general maintenance after they bloom, and timing is critical if you want your azaleas to bloom next year. The best time to prune is within three to four weeks after they finish blooming in the spring. Azaleas, like other plants, need time to make the flower buds for the next year. If you wait too late to prune, you will be cutting off the flower buds for the following spring and instead of having a lovely flowering plant, you will have a green bush with few flowers, if any at all.      There are two classes of azaleas, our native azaleas and the Asian azaleas. Native azaleas are indigenous to many parts of the U.S. and they are growing in popularity. They are sometimes called wild or honeysuckle azaleas and many have a lovely fragrance. These azaleas typically do not need to be pruned because they have a more open shape. However, if you do want to prune them, it is very important to prune at the right time so that you do not miss out on flowers the following year.      On the other hand, the Asian azaleas are the evergreen ones with most of them coming from Japan. Azaleas bloom on old wood. They produce flower buds on last year's growth and for this reason, it is very important to prune immediately after they finish blooming. If you prune in summer or fall, you will be removing the flower buds. The new reblooming azaleas like Encore and Bloom-A- Thon bloom on both last year's growth and the current year's growth. They also need to be pruned in the spring, like the other evergreen azaleas.      When preparing to prune, you need a pair of hand clippers and a pair of loppers. Hand clippers work well on the smaller branches and use the loppers on branches one-half to 1 1/2 inches thick. The long handles of the loppers give you the leverage for cutting larger limbs and allows you to get inside the bush to prune.      I would not use hedge trimmers or shears on azaleas unless you want a formal look or a shaped hedge. If you do this year after year, you will still need to go deep inside from time to time and prune. If you only use hedge trimmers, over time, you will have only growth on the very top of the bush and the plants could become leggy.      In most landscapes, azaleas look best when they are pruned a little each year to let light and air get into the bush yet keep the graceful shape of the bush. This is done by going inside the bush and pruning. I have a rule that I never prune more than one-fourth to one-third of a bush in any given year. You can come back next year and prune again so the bush keeps a lovely shape.      However, if major pruning is needed, and you want to take out more than one- third of the bush, it is best to do this in the late winter. This is only needed when a bush has become overgrown and you want to make it smaller in size. You can cut a bush down to about 18 inches in height but this dramatic pruning must be done in winter when the sap is down. Of course, you will be losing blooms that spring but this way, you will save the bush and it will come back and you can work to keep it under control. I find that larger azaleas, like the Southern Indica azaleas, are the ones that need this pruning if left unpruned year after year.      People are often scared to prune and I can understand this fear. I use to be the same way. What I find is a good solution is to prune some and then go back a few days later and see what you think. You can always cut more if the shrub is still too large. Just remember not to cut more than a quarter to a third of a bush when doing spring pruning.      Recently, I pruned one bed and it looked thin in some places. Looking at that bed several days later, branches were starting to fill in where I had cut and it looked much better. Branches that were squashed had moved over to fill the holes. It makes me think that I need to go prune some more. Plants are forgiving too and they will put out new growth and hide your mistakes.

Unsecured personal loans can pay for almost anything. Their flexibility makes them easy to turn to when you want to consolidate your debts or put in that kitchen island.
 But first assessing all your financing options can save you money. As the economy shifts, so will the way a personal loan fits into your plans.
 Right now, for example, the cheapest way to get extra cash might not be with a personal loan, but with 401(k) funds. The government is allowing penalty-free withdrawals from these savings for those affected by COVID-19.

NEW YORK -- The U.S. Labor Department's monthly employment report to be released on Friday is likely to understate the number of jobs lost during the coronavirus pandemic because many people are not actively looking for new work, Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank President Neel Kashkari said Thursday.
 Kashkari, asked what the jobs report might show during an interview on NBC's Today Show, said the reported unemployment rate could be as high as 17%, but the true unemployment rate may be as high as 23%. "That bad report tomorrow is actually going to understate how bad the damage has been," he said.
 Despite the stark forecast, Kashkari said he was hopeful policymakers could avoid a depression scenario for the U.S. economy after learning lessons from the Great Depression of the 1930s.
 "The Federal Reserve is acting aggressively, we will continue to act aggressively," he said.
 Still, Kashkari said the economic rebound was likely to be "gradual" until there was the development of a vaccine or therapy to treat the virus.
 It could be a while before consumers feel comfortable sitting in a full movie theater or a crowded restaurant, he said, and many restaurants may struggle to make ends meet if they are only serving half as many customers. "Unfortunately, the recovery looks like it is going to be slow," he said.
 Authorities also need to be careful with plans to reopen the economy so they can avoid a flare up of new cases, Kashkari said.
 "The virus is still spreading throughout much of the country," he said. "We have to continue to be very measured and not reopen too quickly because we may pay the price for that." (Reporting by Jonnelle Marte Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)

After my kids left the nest, I went from cooking every night for four people to cooking every night for just my husband and myself. And when I say cooking every night, I actually mean, eating out twice a week, ordering in three times a week, and cooking twice. Actually, I'd cook only once, because the second time we'd have leftovers.      But then we all got quarantined and suddenly I was making three meals a day every day for the two of us for what felt like a year. My husband of course, didn't see anything wrong with this, while I felt like I'd become a short- order cook.      So, when my husband asked me a simple question for the ninety-fifth hundredth time, I kind of lost my mind.      "Hey honey, what's for dinner?" he said.      "Aauugghh!" I yelled and ran into the bathroom. I needed to be alone with my thoughts. There weren't many. It was mostly that I didn't want to make dinner again.      The problem wasn't so much that I had to cook. The problem was what I had to cook with. While other people had bought rolls and rolls of toilet paper for the quarantine, I had stocked up on beans. Apparently, for no reason whatsoever, I was convinced that a pandemic would lead to a shortage of beans, so I panicked and bought a dozen or so cans. But in my bean-induced confusion, I hit the wrong button and instead of ordering a few cans, I ordered a case, and when it arrived, I was the proud owner of 50 cans of beans.      Beside having nowhere to store 50 cans of beans, I had another problem. When I was ordering my beans, I failed to take into account the fact that my family has not historically done too well with beans, and there existed the very real possibility that if I served too many meals made of beans, we would probably, in no uncertain terms, blow up.      This was not something I was guessing at. This was a known fact. Having made chili before, I knew what effects the beans had on my family, and let's just say that there isn't enough Febreeze in the world to overcome what my family let loose. There was a time, once, where I was pretty sure we were to blame for a massive hole in the Earth's ozone that had formed after we had dinner on Chili night.      Then, that weekend, we took our leftovers with us when we went skiing. The next day, I swear we all skied 50% faster because of our "tailwind."      The kids, naturally, found all this hilarious. My husband and I … not so much. At some point, I tried giving everyone some of those natural digestive enzymes they sell in the store for just such a problem. It was clear they didn't help when the gas company showed up at our door after the neighbors reported smelling something noxious coming from our house.      Knowing that the beans posed a serious threat to our comfort, and quite possibly my marriage, I needed to find a way to cook them so neither of us would have a problem. I scoured the internet and discovered that soaking and rinsing the beans prior to cooking, even canned beans, would help a lot.      So, one night I tested the theory and made a batch of Black Bean Sloppy Joes. The rinsing seemed to do the trick for me and I felt no gaseous side effects after dinner. But as we sat on the couch later, I suddenly smelled something so bad it singed my nose hairs.      "Was that you?" I asked my husband as I smothered my face with a pillow.      "No," he said, pulling his shirt up over his nose. "You?"      I shook my head. We both looked down at the dog asleep on the floor.   "Hmmm," I said. "Guess I won't be putting any more beans in his food."   You can follow Tracy on Twitter @TracyBeckerman and become a fan on Facebook at www.facebook.com/LostinSuburbiaFanPage.

Die Bilder entstehen im Realen wie im hier assoziierten Hörspiel im Kopf, es bedarf gar keiner Visualisierung. Darüber hinaus hat das Album aber auch auf ungewöhnlich intensive Weise die Kraft, eine metasprachliche Geschichte assoziativ und Tagtraum-verwandt ohne Text und Gesang entstehen zu lassen. Allerdings sollte man diese Geschichte nicht im Titel suchen und sich nicht zu sehr von Werbetexten und schon erschienenen Besprechungen des Albums beeinflussen lassen, die auf das Auseinandersetzen mit einer neuen (Zweit-)Sprache abzielen, dem jeder, der sein Geburtsland verlässt, in der Fremde ausgesetzt ist. Diese Thematik wird durch die Tracks nicht mehr angetriggert als jede andere Kopfkino-Story. _Go with the flow_ ist hier die weitaus bessere Hörempfehlung als die Orientierung an kursierenden Vorgaben – selbst wenn diese im Sinne des Künstlers sein mögen.

Dtex’s platform — Intercept — offers a view across data, machines, and apps in enterprise environments to spotlight blind spots, like misconfigured rules and intentional security bypasses. This is accomplished in part through contextual audit trails surrounding events to enable detection of early warning signs and investigations. Security teams can query hundreds of thousands of endpoints on the fly, taking advantage of anonymization technology that obscured identifying user information (like user names, machine names, and domain names).

Having a positive attitude ties in with having a strong work ethic. You start a new job, you’re excited to begin and work in a new environment with new people all around you. But as time goes by you find yourself finding loopholes: turning up to work a little later than usual or not putting in as much effort in your work as you did in the beginning. This is not the right attitude! However, this is very common so in order for you to really stand out you need to demonstrate to your potential employer that you are consistent in the work you deliver and your attitude you bring to the working environment. In the interview this can be done by providing examples of situations you went that extra mile and emphasise that you have done this in all the job roles you have previously had. But you want to be realistic, at the end of the day we are not robots. We all have our days, so you don’t want to come across like you are showing off and bragging about all the extra work you did in the office. Find a middle ground, showing you are motivated in the working environment and simple examples to prove it.
