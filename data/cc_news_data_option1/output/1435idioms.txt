Of course, that was just the beginning. Over the centuries, Christianity has divided and sub-divided, continuing to mutate and evolve until this day, in violent conflict over doctrinal differences for centuries until we just seemed to run out of steam. Thus we come to our largely secular society in which church attendance has declined, with the notable exception of the megachurches in which capitalism and Christianity have made a kind of accommodation.

Amy L. Widener April 8, 2020 Amy L. Widener, 51, of Bridgeport, passed away Wednesday, April 8, 2020, at Morrill County Community Hospital in Bridgeport. In an attempt to provide safety and comfort to those who would like to share in her celebration of life, a memorial service will be scheduled at a later date. Online condolences may be made by visiting Amy's memorial page at www.bridgmanfuneralhome.com. Bridgman Funeral Home and Cremation Service in Bridgeport is entrusted with arrangements. Amy Louise Widener was born to Donald and Janet (Lombard) Dawe on December 26, 1968, in Wausau, Wisconsin. She was the eldest of three children and grew up in Burwell, Nebraska, graduating as Salutatorian with the Class of 1987. She went on to further her education at Chadron State College graduating with a bachelor's degree in Accounting. It was at Chadron that she met and married John Franklin Bustos III, in which they welcomed their only son, Jesse Franklin. The two later divorced. It was then that Amy decided to go back to college and get her teaching endorsement in Business and Media Specialist. Shortly after, she received an offer of employment at Bridgeport Public Schools. It was in Bridgeport that she met her husband, Mike, and they made their home here. Amy was a teacher to many and enjoyed reading, either to herself or out loud to children, and gardening. She was an active member of the Friends of Library Board. She volunteered as a Sunday School and Vacation Bible School teacher at First Baptist Church of Bridgeport for many years. She was a member of First Baptist Church and held an office on the Christian Education Board for many years. Family was very important to Amy and she made a connection with all, making them all a priority to keep in contact even if they were miles apart. She also loved to make memories traveling with family, with many trips to visit extended family in Wisconsin. Her children and grandchildren brought her the most joy in life. She could be found making special memories with her grandkids during her spare time, taking numerous trips visiting the zoo, going for walks to the park, making dinner rolls or rollout cookies to frost and decorate, or to just simply play in the snow or spend time at the lake to play in the sand. She lived and loved life to the fullest! Amy is preceded in death by her mother Janet, of whom Amy donated part of her liver to in 2011. Amy is survived by her husband Michael; son Jesse Bustos of Bridgeport; daughter Brandie Widener; and grandchildren Regina and Michael Massingill of Scottsbluff; father Don Dawe of Burwell; brother David (Dee-El) Dawe of Papillion; sister Jennifer (Roger) Maris of McCook; mother-in-law Beth (Dan) Bayless of Bridgeport; brothers-in-law Martin (Lori Stromberg) Widener of Scottsbluff and Marcus (Holly) Widener of Bridgeport; and numerous aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews and cousins.

My assessment of the exercise is that it is fairly okay. We have not had this before; the level of compliance is fair but it could have been better. Many people have not been close to see the other side if we had failed to observe the lockdown government has prescribed. Unfortunately, there is a lot of hunger in the land. A lot of people are daily paid workers and it is difficult sometimes to keep them locked down in the house without having opportunity of getting their daily income. So, by and large, it has been fairly alright. It is better than if we have not locked down, it can always get improved. We need to talk more with our people so that we can get this disease eradicated from Nigeria.

CHADRON — Acting Regional Forester Jennifer Eberlien announced and signed an order to temporarily close developed recreation sites and an order to implement fire restrictions within the Forest Service’s Rocky Mountain Region to align with local, state and federal orders and guidelines to protect public health and safety. Both orders are effectively immediately through May 31, 2020, (unless rescinded sooner). The region includes 24 national forests and grasslands across Nebraska, South Dakota, Colorado, Kansas and Wyoming.
 Recreation Closures For Nebraskans, this means that all developed campgrounds and related amenities – including day-use areas, picnic areas, restroom facilities and trashcans and trash collection services – in the Nebraska and Samuel R. McKelvie National Forests and Oglala National Grasslands are closed. Parking facilities, trails and trailheads remain open. Dispersed camping (meaning camping where recreation facilities or services are not provided) is allowed, and travel management rules still apply. Though dispersed camping, hiking, riding off-highway vehicle trails and river uses are allowed, recreating close to home is recommended.

Nigerians should wash their hands properly, with soap and water or use alcohol based sanitisers, maintain social distancing, when they sneeze, do it into a bended elbow or a tissue paper and discard it appropriately. People should also guard against touching the face, mouth, eyes and nose often. Nigerians should guard against public places, cluster places, shaking hands or hugging. If we keep to all these we will keep Nigeria safe.

 DOROTHY CHARLOTTE KORSTAD April 9, 1920 - April 5, 2020 Smith Funeral Home LTD & Crematory Dorothy Charlotte Korstad, 99, went home to be with her Lord in heaven on April 5 th . Born in Benson, Minnesota, Dorothy grew up in Minnesota and graduated from Bemidji High School. She attended Bemidji State College for two years and taught school in a one room school house in Minnesota. She met William Korstad in Minnesota and they married on July 6, 1941. They moved to Longview, Washington and eventually purchased a farm in Mabton, Washington in 1947. Dorothy was very busy on the farm, raising young children, growing and preparing food, sewing and being a homemaker. Dorothy attended Central Washington University in 1960 and 1961 to finish her four year degree in education. She would commute home on the weekends. In 1962 she started teaching in the Mabton School District and taught third grade for twenty years, retiring in 1982. She also served on the Mabton School Board, a leader in the 4-H club and a Sunday school teacher. As an educator, she made a difference in many children's lives and was a role model to many throughout the Yakima valley. Dorothy and William had a 50 th wedding anniversary celebration in 1991 with their many friends and relatives. They made several trips in retirement including trips to Hawaii and Norway to visit relatives. Dorothy and William were long time members of the Immanuel Lutheran Church in Grandview, Washington. William died in 1992. Dorothy moved from the farm to the Tri-Cities in 2007 when she could no longer drive. Dorothy was a wonderful mother to her children and a great grandmother to her grandchildren. Her children are grateful to her and William for being such good parents. Dorothy was a Christian and always tried to do the right thing and to love others. She had a great life always living on a farm until her later years. The farm life provided outdoor activities, a garden, lots of animals, and exciting experiences. Christmas on the farm was a very special occasion for the whole family. Dorothy is survived by her daughter Anne Stottlemyre, son Bill Korstad (Donna), son Paul Korstad and daughter Jennine Lenseigne (Donald). She is also survived by 14 grandchildren, 32 great grandchildren and one great-great grandchild. She is preceded in death by her husband William Korstad, daughter Carolyn Goodwin, son-in-law Gary Goodwin, son-in law Keith Stottlemyre, daughter-in-law Elaine Korstad, grandson Eric Korstad, her mother and father and ten brothers and sisters. Due to current circumstances there will be a private burial. In remembrance of Dorothy, her wish was that donations be made to the Immanuel Lutheran Church, 1006 West 3rd, Grandview, Wa. 98930. Those wishing to sign Dorothy's online memorial book may do so at www.funeralhomesmith.com Smith Funeral Home is in care of arrangements.

An example of this is the tremendous and crucial role that people older than 65 play in our culture.
 While we may collectively refer to that age group as “elderly” or “seniors,” these people are a broad demographic full of fit and vibrant leaders who are pillars in our community and our country.
 And they are the backbone of the volunteer corps.
 Those familiar with local meal delivery and Meals on Wheels programs long have known that while many of the recipients are in this age group, so, too, are many of the volunteers.
 That unsung role came into focus in mid-March, when local senior centers closed and organizations such as the Northeast Iowa Area Agency on Aging sought to deliver even more meals than normal. Those groups also looked for additional volunteers, not only because of the increased efforts but because some of their most-dependable help now was most at risk with COVID-19 spreading.
 When Wisconsin pressed on with its spring election last week, one of the biggest challenges that counties faced was a lack of poll workers. Why? Because, by and large, it is senior citizens who handle that task.
 Many of them, understandably, decided to protect their health and let someone else handle the election duties this year. Still, many of those who turned out to help were 65-plus, wearing masks and gloves.
 Across our communities, we have hospitals, churches and nonprofit agencies that are powered by a legion of volunteers who are mainly in the over-65 demographic.
 Yet this is the very group that is most vulnerable to this virus.
 Suddenly, seniors are not always there to fill the roles they typically do. This group has come to understand the value of good health better than younger generations tend to. They are less likely to put themselves at risk. Therefore, when community leaders, government officials and health care experts say, “Stay at home,” these cohorts will listen.
 The circumstance creates a vantage point that we might not otherwise have seen. Able seniors give volumes to our communities every day. They are DuRide drivers and hospital gift shop workers. They tend to community gardens and serve funeral dinners at churches. They visit the elderly, the sick and the lonely. They are politically engaged, civic minded and good neighbors.
 In the midst of this pandemic, they deserve our protection. This virus makes prey of the vulnerable. While the young and healthy could likely endure a diagnosis, older citizens are at much greater risk.
 As we brace for the peak of this scourge to hit our region, we must do right by the seniors who contribute so much to our society. Reach out to older folks to see if they need help. Practice social distancing, if not for yourself, then for them. And take a moment to appreciate the generation of doers that keep so many community volunteer efforts going.

But in the grip of a coronavirus pandemic, the deliverance of Passover, the promise of Resurrection, even the prospect of an advancing spring — all are shadowed by an awareness of danger and the possibility of an untimely death. We stand apart, venturing out only when necessary, and then gloved and masked against a threat we but dimly understand but rightly fear.
 It is an unsettling time, in which no one seems to be in charge. It’s not quite every man for himself, but close to it. The federal government has largely abdicated responsibility, leaving it up to individual states to work things out. Fortunately, some governors are up to the task, but not all. So the virus spreads unevenly across the land, losing its strength only where individuals stand apart in isolation, waiting for the threat to make its way through every city and county until it runs its course.

Patients blow their nose before the swab is taken, and then the sample is sealed in a plastic envelope.
 For the most part, during the drive-thru testing, persons being tested would just roll down their window a small portion, both to protect the person and the guardsmen doing the testing. Because the coronavirus has been identified as potentially airborne, guardsmen wore N95 masks, and over the top of those, face shields. The personal protective equipment worn by guardsmen is more than that worn by doctors and nurses in hospitals. They also wore decontamination suits, with areas such as between the gloves and sleeves taped off to prevent the virus from getting on their clothing. At the conclusion of the day’s testing, each of those participating in the exercise would be decontaminated with a bleach solution sprayed onto the suits.
 Prior to the testing, guardsmen themselves are evaluated before the day begins, with vitals taken. During the testing, they try to stay 6-feet apart as well.
 Vu described the testing efforts of the National Guard as a partnership with communities and public health districts, a way for soldiers and airmen to serve close to home.
 “We are here because the community is asking us to be here,” he said. “We are here for our country. These soldiers and these airmen are doing what we do best, which is to serve.”
 Newman described the testing process as smooth. Each day, about 50 people were tested. The National Guard could test a large amount of people and brought their own tests.
 “They have the personnel to do the drive-thru clinic,” he said. “We just don’t have that. We would have to pull people out of hospitals and clinics to be able to set that up.”
 Public health officials are hopeful that the National Guard will return to the Panhandle in the future, depending on the how long the state is impacted by the coronavirus, Newman said.

The Jharkhand government is on the horns of a dilemma over the coronavirus lockdown as extending it would lead to financial distress and lifting it could trigger an influx of migrants into the state, Chief Minister Hemant Soren said on Saturday.During an interaction with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Soren said his government is expecting over 5 lakh migrant labourers to return to their villages once the lockdown is lifted, increasing the possibility of the spread of the deadly virus.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here But continuing with the lockdown will further dry up the state's revenue, he added."Whether the lockdown is lifted or extended, it is a difficult situation for us from both ways," Soren told the prime minister during the video conference held with chief ministers to assess the situation in states due to the pandemic."As per our data, a large number of labourers are stranded in states severely affected by the coronavirus outbreak. When they will return, the situation could deteriorate. They may come as carriers of the virus," Soren said.He said over 1.5 lakh migrant workers have already returned to Jharkhand and had to be quarantined.Soren urged Modi to increase the daily wage under rural job scheme MGNREGA to Rs300. "I believe the wage under MGNREGA in the state is the lowest in the country. Therefore, a large number of people from Jharkhand migrate to other states and are earning Rs 700or Rs 900 per day. Even after the recent announcement of wage hike under the scheme, it has not crossed Rs 200 in Jharkhand... So I request you to fix the wage under the scheme at Rs 300," Soren said.Click here for complete coronavirus coverageThe increase in wages under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act came into effect on April 1.The chief minister also requested Modi to consider waiver of interest for existing loans for the current fiscal and urged him to consider releasing the GST compensation arrear.A large number of PSUs like DVC, CCL and SAIL are functioning in Jharkhand and they havedues to the government, he mentioned.
