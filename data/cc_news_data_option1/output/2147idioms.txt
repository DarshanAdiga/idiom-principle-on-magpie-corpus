Because June 1 is the first official day of hurricane season, however, this is a good time to begin your preparations and maybe a storm in the Gulf is the right motivation. Back in 2014, we provided a list of the must-have's for the hurricane season. It still applies. Given the insanity we've witnessed in the last six years, the alcohol part might be more important than the rest.
 Still, there isn't reason to panic over this storm. Even if it does reach the coast of Texas, it seems unlikely to be a serious threat like Hurricane Harvey. For one, it will be moving much more quickly and deliberately around high pressure, which we didn't have in 2017, unfortunately. Also, it isn't expected to be terribly well organized by the time it reaches our area.
 Never the less, preparation is a good thing. We are assuming you are stocked up on toilet paper and hand sanitizer. You have plenty of time to deal with the rest.
 Now, about those murder hornets...
