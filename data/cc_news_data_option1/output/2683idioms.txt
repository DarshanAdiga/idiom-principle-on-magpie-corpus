“In the end, we think we’ll have a better plan because of these meetings,” Moore said.
 Moore said the plan that they’ve sent – which is ongoing and updated frequently – is currently their “best thinking” on reopening. They have also created a Frequently Asked Questions section on the SPS website’s reopening page.
 The newest information Moore wanted to relay is to let everyone know is that they are forging ahead with face coverings, and they explained their reasoning behind choosing Edgenuity as the online vendor. Moore also said they have worked out a contract with T-Mobile that he believes will make internet hotspots available to students who need internet access.
 “We’re making sure with the help of our parents, coming up with a plan that everyone has internet access and access to a device if needed,” he said. “If our assumptions are right, we think we can do that, starting to get hotspots out based on need.”
 Renner is leading organization of the safety aspects of reopening. She said she has worked with a reopening task force of medical professions to focus on operations.
 “One of the most important is our face covering consideration,” she said. “The task force has been talking through the appropriateness and ares of concern that I know some people have about managing that, from Pre-K to 12th grade levels across the district.”
 She said the district plans to provide rewashable cotton face

ENTERPRISE — Six people are the recipients of this year’s scholarships given to employees of Wallowa Memorial Hospital or another local health care nonprofit, according to a press release.
 The six winners are: Shannon Barnhart, seeking board certification as a geriatric clinical specialist in physical therapy; Elvie Bevers, seeking a RN license; Krystal Butterfield, seeking continuing education in pelvic floor function, dysfunction and treatment; Amanda Vieira De Melo, seeking a bachelor of nursing degree from Oregon Health Sciences University; Stacey Karvoski, seeking executive level leadership training; and Ashley Sullivan, seeking certification from the American Academy of Professional Coders as a certified professional compliance officer.
 The two scholarships include the Gwen and Gladys Coffin Memorial Scholarship and the Edgar Burbridge and Frances Boyd Burbridge Scholarship. Each offers up to $2,000 toward education and training, and both require applicants be local residents committed to staying in the county.
 The Wallowa Valley Health Care Foundation usually offers two scholarships each year. But this year, six applicants met the criteria, so the foundation board awarded all six.

BEN Looker claimed his first win in Grafton Cup Day after a confident ride on heavy favourite Simply Sacred in the Tab Mother’s Gift 1400m on Thursday.
 The win is a good omen for Looker, who lifted the 2019 Grafton Cup on another sacred-themed runner in Sacred Day.
 Coming in at the shortest odds for the July Carnival yet ($1.60), the four- year-old Edward O’Rourke-trained mare was made to work for the win as John Sprague’s Maid Marilyn pushed her all the way to the line.
 “It was good to get the job done. Ben was pretty cool with her but it seemed like she had plenty in the tank,” O’Rourke said.
 “I’ll see what Ben says when he comes back.”
 The O’Rourke runner made up for an unfortunate last start at Grafton when she was disqualified on June 11.
 O’Rourke hinted at big things ahead for the promising runner.
 “She could be up for a Country Championship, we’ll have to see how she fares,” he said.
 Cutting back from 59kg to 56kg, Looker made it look easy on the composed mare to win his sixth race for the July Carnival.
 Murwillumbah trainer Matt Dunn had a good chance in Axella but is still searching for an elusive win after going close on a number of occasions during Ramornie Handicap Day.
 O’Rourke will make a charge at the Iron Jack Grafton Cup later in the day as four-year-old gelding Nemingah ($21) goes from barrier 6 with jockey Mr Rachel King on board.

And finally the hottest news today have to do with Apple, but you're gonna have to bare with me as these are two separate reports. On the first one, according to a Taiwanese report, Apple will be releasing the new 14in MacBook Pro with that miniLED display in Q1 of 2021, along with the refreshed 16in variant. We're expecting 6 new products with miniLED displays next year and there's a possibility that these new MacBook Pros will be powered by Apple Silicon. Now let's just wonder what the price will be. Oh and speaking of the price, as for the second segment, according to a new research note provided to MacRumors, an analyst claims that even with the changes to the iPhone 12's box, pricing for the 5.4in iPhone 12 will increase to $749 instead of the $699 we saw with the iPhone 11. According to him, this is because of the addition of 5G and the OLED display instead of the LCD we saw on the 11. He also says that because of 5G, consumers will accept it and it won't affect the demand. Later on he also mentions that the 6.1in iPhone 12 will start at either $799 or $849, while the Pros will still start at $999 and $1099. This information contradicts the previous leaks we got from multiple trusted sources but, we'll still take it into account.

Bolsonaro said this week that he had tested positive for the virus but already feels better thanks to hydroxychloroquine.

Willie Breedt, the CEO of VaultAge Solutions, allegedly defrauded over 2,000 investors and stealing around $16.3 million. Breedt has been handed a sequestration order by a local South African court. Authorities have confiscated Breedt's laptop and a Ledger Nano cryptocurrency hard wallet. A local South African court has declared Willie Breedt, CEO of cryptocurrency investment firm VaultAge Solutions, bankrupt while he was on the run from investors. Breedt was accused of defrauding over 2,000 investors and stealing around $16.3 million. According to a recent News24 report, the CEO has been handed a sequestration order by the Gauteng High Court in Pretoria. A sequestration order is a court-delivered order that forces a debtor into bankruptcy. Before going into hiding a couple of weeks ago, Breedt had opened a case of intimidation with police in Jeffreys Bay. A few debt collectors hired by frustrated investors had tracked him down at a guesthouse in the Silver Lakes Estate in Pretoria, which he had booked using a fake name. After the sequestration order was granted, South Africa's Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation, aka "the Hawks," raided the guesthouse. They confiscated a laptop and a Ledger Nano crypto hard wallet, which is suspected of containing some of the stolen funds. Breedt has not been arrested, according to the News24 report. South Africa's central bank has ordered PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) to investigate VaultAge Solutions and the agents who might have carried out transactions on the company's behalf.

John L. Hintermeister October 5, 1938 - July 5, 2020 MUSCATINE - In the blink of an eye and with no warning at all, the world lost a husband, a father, a grandfather, a brother, a lawyer, a hunter, a boat maker, a fisherman, a pilot, a story teller. For those left behind, the world will never be quite the same. He was born to Herschel Oliver Hintermeister and Rita St. Dennis Hintermeister and began his life on a farm. He would go on to earn his Juris Doctorate from the University of Iowa in 1966 and practice law for many years, crossing paths with so many different people along that journey. He was City Attorney in Muscatine alongside Evelyn Schauland as Mayor. He became a pilot with a variety of different airplanes and many an adventure did they take him on including camping on the beach of the Baja Peninsula, flying to the Bahamas and flying down the center of the Grand Canyon. He crashed his plane not once but twice and survived to tell about it! When he got that craziness out of his system he went on to take up traveling the country in his RV with his wife and found so many more friends and adventures on that route. He built four wooden boats and not one of them sank......He was an avid outdoors man and loved to hunt when he was younger and still loved to fish. His love of water and boating was passed down and he took several chartered sailing trips together as well. More than anything he loved to tell a story, and this is his. He is survived by his wife Judith, his sisters Bette Schneider and Gloria Fryer, his daughters Dr. Melinda Hintermeister and Lisa Burwell, his son Michael Hintermeister, his step children Todd MacSorley and Heather West, his grandsons Seth and Sam Hintermeister and Derrick and David Bueno and four great grand children. He was preceded in death by his parents and his sister Karen. He was not one for fuss and has always requested no funeral service, but he wanted a gathering of people to come together and tell a story. Please join us at the Mississippi Brew on August 16 from 2-6 pm and share what it was like to be a friend or a family member or just someone who passed through his life. In lieu of flowers please make memorial donations to the Esther Bishop Scholarship Fund at the Muscatine Community College. He was active in helping her establish that fund, One of his most frequent recitals was "don't ask how we got here. Just ask what we are going to do now." In life and now in death I believe that he would still be saying this.
