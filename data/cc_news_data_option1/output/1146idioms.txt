Some restaurants are shuttering, unable to balance high rents with a decline in customers. Others are finding unexpected ways to adapt. The Los Gatos restaurant Manresa, which boasts three Michelin stars, has closed for dinner and told its hourly employees to sign up for unemployment. But it's now transformed into a takeout joint, offering a gourmet "family meal to go" for $35 to $59 per head. Friday's menu included Japanese Medai a la plancha and seasoned sushi rice along with Pineapple upside-down cake.

Arsenal lack a credible replacement for Mesut Ozil reckons Adrian Clarke
 Former Arsenal academy graduate Adrian Clarke is of the opinion that Mesut Ozil has to continue in the first eleven simply because there is no adequate replacement within the current squad.
 Ozil has been one of Arsenal’s most important players since he joined the north London side from Real Madrid.
 However, after signing his latest contract, the German has been underwhelming in his performances for the Gunners.
 His £350k per week wage is also causing problems for Arsenal as they try to renew the contract of their other players.
 He is expected to leave Arsenal within the next 18 months or so as he isn’t in the club’s long term plans, and fans have been wondering who would take over his creative position.
 The Gunners have targeted a number of other creative players as his replacement, but until they bring someone new onboard Clarke believes they need to persevere with Ozil for now.
 Speaking on The Chronicles of a Gooner podcast as cited by the Express, he asked: “Who would you rather have in the team over Ozil playing that creative role?
 “People might say push [Dani] Ceballos forward, I think the jury’s out whether he would be as good, certainly not better, as Ozil in there.
 “Would you want a front two which would take Ozil out of the equation? All the evidence we’ve seen so far is that Arteta doesn’t so I think we have to put that one to bed.
 “Could Martinelli play there as a sort of youthful energetic No 10 that goes here, there and everywhere? Maybe but has he got that tactical awareness yet that Mesut has? No.
 “Could Pepe play there? Possibly, that might be a role for him in the long term but again, has he got that in-game intelligence?
 “You have to be smart and clever with your movements to play in that No 10 role.
 “Ozil will only function at his best in a team that plays fast football, that moves the ball between the lines quickly before opposition teams are set.
 “We’ve seen it a few times of late where it’s been brilliant and if Arsenal can get to that level again I think we will see him have more positives games than negative.
 “For now, I think he’s in the first eleven.”

The third Green Glob story appears in Tales of the Unexpected 87. This tale starts off differently than the previous two, as we follow a cop pursuing a jewel thief.  The cop has treated some pearls with "radioactivity" so that he can trail the thief, but the man vanishes into the blue anyway. The cop is left befuddled.  But the Green Glob shows up, and when the cop wishes he could be where the thief is, the Glob transports him to the alien planet where the thief has fled.  The thief is stealing pearls for the aliens in exchange for a hypnosis machine. There are some alien cops on the trail of the bad aliens as well, who pretty much save the day.  The pearls have the same hypnotic effect on the aliens that the machine has on humans.  The pair return to Earth, and the cop destroys the teleportation device. So the Green Glob acts once again to bring a thief to justice, but does so by fulfilling the policeman's wish. A bit different than the previous tales.

“I always try to go out there and play with a lot of energy and I’m gonna miss it a lot,” Paul said.
 Stephanie Paul has played a large part in shaping the talented team that Georgia will put on the floor next season. Fellow senior Ari Henderson played a very different role as a Georgia Bulldog.
 Henderson was not recruited to be a part of the 2016-17 class like Paul was. When coach Taylor saw a need for filling another roster spot she held open tryouts to accept a walk-on. After watching Henderson’s tryout, Taylor knew that was the type of player she wanted playing for her team.
 Henderson was never a huge contributor on the stat sheet. She only saw minutes in six games during her senior campaign and only started one game throughout her career. She did, however, play a large role in preparing the Bulldogs for each game. She was the leader of the scout team which ran the opposing team’s offense for the starters to practice against. This meant studying tons of film and working hard to push the starters as much as she could.
 “[Henderson] helps with preparing for each game from the scout team. She goes through the other team’s offense and really pushes us and kills us on offense,” Paul said. “She gets buckets left and right.”
 This production does not go unnoticed as Taylor and all of the players recognize Henderson as one of the most important members of the squad.

Chris Smalling is supposedly keen on extending his stay with Roma beyond the summer when his loan deal ends.
 The Manchester United defender moved to the Giallorossi last summer after the arrival of Harry Maguire from Leicester, and he has enjoyed becoming a fans favourite in Italy.
 Not many English players make the jump to play abroad, let alone in Italy, but Chris has been taken in by Roma fans, although their recent defensive record should post question marks.
 Smalling has started (and completed) 21 of his side’s 26 Serie A outings, and although the league has currently been suspended, the defender is believed to be keen on extending that stay beyond the summer, so much so that he is even believed to be willing to reduce his wages to do so.
 Arsenal were believed to be one of a number of clubs looking to bring him back to the Premier League after his impressive performances in Italy, but that idea may now have to take a back seat.
 Arsene Wenger tried to sign the England international previously from Fulham some time ago, before the Red Devils managed to secure his signature, and he was held in high regard by the Frenchman.
 Whether we actually have a need for another defensive addition is up for debate however, with William Saliba already signed and awaiting arrival, as well as the more-than-likely deal to complete a deal for Pablo Mari, who has been impressing on loan from Brazilian outfit Flamengo.
 Do Arsenal need more experienced defensive additions? Would Smalling have improved our squad?

Perché qualunque puttanata ideologica sostengano con incompetenza e malafede i sovranisti odierni, la pandemia del Coronavirus ha dimostrato a tutti quanti che il mondo è piccolo (e la gente mormora – troppo). Che gli Stati nazionali, i confini amministrativi e i fili spinati sono ferrivecchi. E che al di là del figurone di merda fatto da classi dirigenti e ampie fette di popolo, persino Unione europea, Usa, Cina e Russia sono una dimensione geopolitica ininfluente di fronte a certe calamità.

Premier League looking to name a start date for football at next meeting
 The Premier League is set to resume talks regarding the resumption of the Premier League season on the 3rd of April, according to reports.
 The Premier League agreed to suspend the competition indefinitely until the end of April at the earliest, but the Telegraph claims that the competition’s organisers are planning to restart the division on June 1 so that this season can be finished and a new campaign can start almost immediately in August.
 Those games would most likely be played behind closed doors but everyone is focused on finishing the current campaign.
 June 1 is just one of many dates that have been suggested to those that would make the final decision, but the Premier League and clubs failed to agree on a date when they held an emergency call last week.
 FIFA and UEFA are also meeting to make decisions that would be far-reaching in the new week and clubs would have to make their decisions in line with the decisions made by the governing bodies.
 Another very important issue would be when the pandemic would reach its peak.
 Clubs will have to consider when the pandemic would reach its peak in the UK as they would need to consider emergency services before they can start playing the games.
 Teams will also be expected to adhere to safety guidelines even if the games are played behind closed doors.
