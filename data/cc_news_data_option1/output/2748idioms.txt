In the backdrop of propaganda campaign unleashed by some vested local and foreign interests and the challenges thrown by Covid-19, which affected operations and working of almost all organizations and industries, this is not a mean achievement as it conveys a refreshing message to the nation that Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission was capable of delivering as per expectations of the people. This is also evident from the fact that C-1 and C-2 are producing electricity at an average tariff of Rs. 11.16/kWh, while C-2 has been operating at above 99% capacity factor. It is a matter of pride for Pakistan that the plant achieved the status of 11th best performing plant among 41 WANO-TC nuclear plants in the world. Extension of life of KANUPP, a highly complicated job, is yet another evidence of ingenuity and hard work of Pakistani scientists, engineers and technicians. The safe and perfect operation of nuclear power plants, a fact repeatedly acknowledged by the international nuclear watchdog – IAEA, also highlights the unjustified discriminatory approach of some world powers that are reluctant to enter into civil nuclear cooperation with Pakistan. They are extending fullest cooperation and assistance to India, which has poor record in this regard, but they are not willing even to supply the nuclear fuel to Pakistan. However, thanks to our trusted friend China, Pakistan is steadily proceeding ahead to achieve the goal of setting nuclear power plants to generate 8,800 MW of electricity and Beijing has also undertaken to ensure provision of nuclear fuel for lifetime of the plants. The country’s energy security efforts would receive a boost when under-construction K-2 and K-3 plants in Karachi would add 2,200 MW of electricity to the national grid. No doubt, the country is making worthwhile investment in nuclear energy field but our long-term interests demand diversion of more resources to change the energy mix and overcome the problem of circular debt. As pointed out by PAEC Chairman Muhammad Naeem, the organization is also striving to achieve United Nations’ Sustainable Goals (SDGs) like producing clean energy and socio-economic development of the country in health, agriculture and quality education. Mindful of the nuclear apartheid, PAEC has established its own engineering support set up to provide state of the art heavy mechanical as well as high precision engineering equipment support to all of its projects and plants. In addition it has the capacity to provide engineering services to other public/private sector industries in Pakistan. Such efforts, aimed at indigenization, need to be supported through all means in the given regional and global environment. One must also acknowledge the unmatched contribution of PAEC in ensuring provision of quality manpower to its own set-ups and other sectors of national life. It has set up many training institutes/centres, fully equipped with latest and state-of-the-art facilities, aiming to provide high quality education and training to its workforce and graduates produced by leading institutes like Pakistan Institute of Engineering & Applied Sciences (PIEAS), Karachi Institute of Power Engineering (KINPOE) and CHASNUPP Centre of Nuclear Training (CHASCENT) are rendering services not just in PAEC but have also excelled in other organizations and fields. Besides education, these institutions are also making valuable contribution towards the Research & Development (R&D) programs of Pakistan. Similarly, PAEC has taken the lead in utilizing nuclear technology to improve productivity of agriculture sector through the introduction of new crop varieties, pest control technologies, plant nutrition and water management, animal health and productivity and food decontamination and preservation. Medical facilities and diagnostic centres established by Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission are also one of the best in the country especially in credible diagnosis and treatment of cancer at affordable cost. Apart from all this, no one can truly gauge the enormous efforts and contribution of PAEC in strengthening national security and defence despite challenges and pressures of all sorts.

While a number of orchestra around the world have created such virtual performances, the Tulsa Symphony’s performance of Faingold’s work is one of the first original compositions written for this format.
 Faingold, whose compositions include “The Defiant Poet: Elegy in Memory of Yevgeny Yevtushenko,” which the Signature Symphony at Tulsa Community College premiered in 2017, said he was inspired to create “We Persist” during the first few weeks of being self-quarantined in response to the coronavirus pandemic.
 “It was one of those things that kind of happened in a flash,” Faingold said. “It took about a week to finish at the end of March. I wanted to make something that would resonate with people, that had those anthemic, feel-good qualities — a kind of musical ‘call to arms’ at a time when arts organizations everywhere are in an existential crisis.”
 Faingold said the piece was written with extremely practical considerations as well.
 “It had to be a piece for which every instrumental part could be learned and recorded quickly, and then be able to be edited into a whole,” he said. “For me, the most amazing thing is that everything you see and hear in this finished piece was recorded on individual phones and iPads.”

MANSFIELD -- An Easton man surrendered to police early Sunday morning after allegedly holding up a Mansfield CVS at gunpoint Saturday night, according to Mansfield police.
 Matthew Sarnowitz, 37, of Easton, is facing armed robbery and associated charges as the investigation continues, police said.
 The CVS at 216 Chauncy St., which is open 24 hours, reported being robbed at gunpoint Saturday night, just before 12 a.m. The suspect was described as a white male in a hoodie, police said.
 The suspect was said to have fled into the woods behind the Mansfield Post Office on Giles Place.
 Mansfield officers arrived and coordinated with Foxboro and state police to set up a perimeter around the wooded area between Copeland Drive, Chauncy Street and Route 140, police said.
 Video confirmed a handgun had been shown to the clerk on duty at CVS and as a result of the large area to be searched and the high likelihood the suspect was there, resources from the Metropolitan Law Enforcement Council were requested including more K9 units and personnel to search the thick wooded area, according to police. Crisis negotiators were also requested.
 Mansfield officer Michael Fitzgerald and his K9 Ronan participated in the search.
 "He tracked him to a good location that helped confirm that he was still located in the wooded area," Mansfield Police Chief Ron Sellon said. "We called for more resources due to the firearm and having a good perimeter set to contain the scene and hopefully deescalate and get him to surrender (which he eventually did)."
 At 4 a.m., Sarnowitz came out of the woods, without a shirt or shoes, having apparently discarded them in the woods and was taken into custody without incident, police said.
 Police recovered cash taken from the robbery and clothing in the woods, police said.
 "We have not recovered the gun as of yet," Sellon said.
 "We want to thank our law enforcement partners at MetroLEC, Foxborough Police Department, Massachusetts State Police, and Southeastern Massachusetts Regional Emergency Communications Center for their assistance," Mansfield police stated on its Facebook page.

NEW YORK -- Six women who claim they were sexually abused by Harvey Weinstein urged a U.S. judge on Monday to reject an $18.9 million settlement with the disgraced movie producer, the board of his former studio and other accusers.
 The settlement announced on June 30 would end litigation by New York Attorney General Letitia James and separate class-action litigation, and permit accusers to claim $7,500 to $750,000 each.
 But in a Manhattan federal court filing, the six women said accusers would receive just $11.2 million after deducting legal fees and costs, with typical awards of just $10,000 to $20,000, while shielding the defendants' insurers from big payouts.
 They also complained that the accord "absolved" Weinstein, his brother Bob Weinstein and the board of liability, while setting aside another $15.2 million to help cover their defense costs.
 The settlement is "a cruel hoax" and among "the most one-sided and unfair class settlements in history," the filing said. "The main winners … are Harvey Weinstein, Robert Weinstein, and the ultra-wealthy former directors of The Weinstein Co."
 James' office and a lawyer for Weinstein did not respond to requests for comment. Gerald Maatman, a lawyer for the Weinstein Cos, declined to comment.
 The settlement requires approval by U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein.
 In 2010, he initially rejected a settlement for workers suffering from health problems after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, saying he would not approve it "based on fear or ignorance."
 Weinstein, 68, is serving a 23-year prison term following his Feb. 24 conviction for sexually assaulting a former production assistant and raping a onetime aspiring actress.
 He is appealing, and still faces rape and sexual assault charges in Los Angeles.
 The guilty verdict was a milestone for the #MeToo movement, which starting in late 2017 inspired women to accuse hundreds of powerful men in business, entertainment, media, politics and other fields of sexual misconduct.

"The day after the Supreme Court ruling that eastern Oklahoma's an Indian Reservation, we had our first real test of how this will work," Watkins said.
 The U.S. Supreme Court upheld challenges from two American Indians who claimed criminal cases prosecuted against them in state court should have been tried in federal court because Congress never disestablished the 19th century boundaries of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation reservation.
 The decisions mean Oklahoma prosecutors lack the authority to pursue charges against American Indian defendants in much of eastern Oklahoma, including the city of Tulsa.
 Since statehood, state courts have heard criminal cases where jurisdiction was considered to be on nontribal-owned land, while federal courts have handled “major crimes” that occurred on tribally owned land, referred to as “Indian Country.”
 Tulsa Police Department's homicide unit and federal authorities began talks after the court ruling on how to proceed; however, Watkins said Friday's homicide forced them to learn "on the fly."
 Landry's tribal affiliation, if any, was unavailable Monday. Tribal enrollment, prior to the Thursday ruling, was not a regular part of the investigative process, he said.
 "We're going to have to work this out and come up with some processes, and obviously one of the first questions we're going to have to (start asking) is whether our suspects are Native American or not," Watkins said.

Tulsa police requested federal and Muscogee (Creek) Nation Lighthorse assistance to investigate the death.
 A 911 caller told dispatchers that a man ran up to him and said "he needed help because his girlfriend was going to die," according to a criminal complaint.
 Landry was standing over the woman when emergency responders arrived. Investigators then detained Landry for questioning. The woman had sustained a gunshot wound to the head, and investigators located a shotgun nearby under some sticks.
 "(Landry) admitted that he was holding the gun when it went off," investigators state in the criminal complaint. "He claimed that the victim put the gun in her own mouth as they argued and that it was unintentional."
 Landry allegedly acknowledged that he had previously pointed the firearm at the victim.
 The case will go to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Oklahoma. The investigation into the Cherokee citizen's death remains ongoing.
 Watkins drew an analogy to bank robbery investigations. While a bank robbery is a federal crime, Tulsa police still investigate those types of robberies. The homicide unit will continue to investigate homicides; however, homicide cases involving tribal members will go to federal prosecutors instead of state prosecutors.
 In Landry's case, federal and Tulsa police investigators consulted with Muscogee (Creek) Nation Lighthorse Police, and "it was determined" that Tulsa police would assist in the investigation, according to the criminal complaint.
 State, federal and tribal officials, since the court decision, have reaffirmed their commitments to working jointly, according to a Thursday news release from the Oklahoma Attorney General's Office.
 "We have a shared commitment to maintaining public safety and long-term economic prosperity for the Nations and Oklahoma," state and tribal officials said in a joint statement.

SAN DIEGO (AP) — A Navy official said Monday a fire suppression system was inoperable when a blaze erupted aboard the USS Bonhomme Richard in San Diego.Rear Adm. Philip Sobeck said the Halon gas system had been turned off while the amphibious assault ship was undergoing maintenance work.The fire erupted Sunday morning and continues to burn. It broke out in an area where cardboard and drywall supplies were stored and firefighters initially fought it with water until they had to withdraw. Halon is a liquefied compressed gas that disrupts the chemical process of a fire.THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below.SAN DIEGO (AP) — Firefighters were still battling a blaze Monday on a Navy combat ship that injured at least 57 people and sent acrid smoke billowing over San Diego.The fire began Sunday morning aboard the USS Bonhomme Richard, apparently in a vehicle storage area as the ship was in a berth undergoing maintenance, according to Rear Adm. Philip Sobeck.Initially, 17 sailors and four civilians were reported injured but by Monday the number had grown to 57 and five remained hospitalized for observation, the Navy said.Firefighters attacked the flames inside the ship while firefighting vessels with water cannons directed streams of seawater into the ship and helicopters made water drops.“Sailors across this waterfront are absolutely doing a magnificent job,” Sobeck said Sunday.He said there was no ordnance on board, and while the ship holds a million gallons (3.7 million liters) of fuel, it was “well below” any heat source.About 160 sailors and officers were on board when an explosion and flames sent up a huge plume of dark smoke from the 840-foot (255-meter) amphibious assault vessel, which has been docked at Naval Base San Diego. That’s far fewer than the thousand typically on the ship when it’s on active duty, said Mike Raney, a spokesman for Naval Surface Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet.All crew members were accounted for, said Admiral Mike Gilday, chief of naval operations.The San Diego Air Pollution Control District warned that concentrations of fine particulate matter could reach unhealthful levels in some areas and that people should limit exposure, staying indoors if possible.Sobeck, commander of Expeditionary Strike Group 3, said the Navy thinks the fire began somewhere in a lower cargo hold where equipment and vehicles are stored.The fire spread up into office and personnel berths where it was fueled by paper, cloth, rags or other materials, Sobeck said. He said he was not concerned about the air quality or toxicity around the fire.“There was a report of an internal explosion,” Sobeck said. “What we cannot ascertain is exactly what the explosion was caused from.”The admiral suggested that the compartment heated up and over-pressurized.The 23-year-old ship has the capacity to deploy and land helicopters, certain types of short-takeoff airplanes, smaller boats and amphibious vehicles.Because of its age, a fire could be particularly destructive, especially if it reached the engine room and other tight spaces with machinery, said Lawrence B. Brennan, a professor of admiralty and international maritime law at Fordham University in New York.“The heat of a fire of this nature can warp the steel, and that can be a major problem for any ship,” said Brennan. “On an older ship, it’s even more of a problem.”Brennan said it was worrisome that the fire continued to burn for more than a full day.“My guess is that ... there’s going to be a lot of internal damage,” he said.Two other docked ships, USS Fitzgerald and USS Russell, were moved to berths away from the fire, officials said.The ship was commissioned in 1998, and is the third to bear the name Bonhomme Richard. During the Revolutionary War, Capt. John Paul Jones named the first ship after the French translation of the pen name Benjamin Franklin used as the author of “Poor Richard’s Almanac.”—-Associated Press writers Christopher Weber and John Antczak contributed from Los Angeles.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

 Nasra Gele calls her brother Abdinassir Abdille every single morning to check how he's doing.
 The siblings have been separated for more than 20 years. Gele and Abdille, along with their parents, moved to the Daadab refugee complex in Kenya after fleeing their war-torn homeland, Somalia, in 1991. Gele eventually came to Halifax in 1997, but her family stayed behind.
 While she's thought about her family members often throughout her time in Nova Scotia, the past few months have been especially difficult and their catch-up WhatsApp calls have become less and less lighthearted, according to Gele.
 Abdille's asthma has become more threatening over the last two years, and with COVID-19 preventing puffers and medication from flowing to the Daadab refugee complex, Gele said she worries that her brother, too, will fall victim to the chronic disease. Asthma runs in their family and it claimed the lives of their aunt and grandfather.
 "Every morning I talk to them to see how he's doing. Some days he's OK, some days he's getting worse, sometimes it's really scary," said Gele.
 "The situation is very, very hard now. Every night, my brother thinks (whether) he will die now or not. When he's home and he's sitting, really he cannot even breathe."
 Abdille's 14-year-old daughter Nasteeh, who similarly suffers from asthma, has also been on Gele's mind lately. Gele said the father and daughter have hardly stepped foot outside in the last four months during the COVID-19 pandemic, given their immuno compromised state.
 United We Win Halifax, a private sponsorship group that met Gele through her translation and settlement support services for newcomers in Nova Scotia, has launched a GoFundMe campaign to raise money to sponsor and bring Abdille, his wife and seven of their children who are under 18, to Halifax.
 "We were really struck partly by how much Nasra was doing in the community, but also trying to support her brother (in Kenya), sending money to him to buy food and medication," said Dave Aalders, a member of United We Win Halifax.
 Aalders said Gele told him about the asthma attacks her brother would have where he "didn't know (if) he was going to live" and the limited health care and access to medication at the refugee complex. That prompted the group to lend a hand.
 "We want to be able to help," he said.
 "And also the fact that (Abdille) has been (at the refugee camp) since the early '90s and the world sort of tends to forget about some refugees, that bothered us as well, that there are folks that have been there for that long and haven't had a chance to get out."
 The group's GoFundMe fundraising goal is $10,000, but that will only cover a portion of the $30,000 that is required to bring a refugee family the size of the Abdille family to Canada and support them for one year, according to Aalders.
 They have also set up accounts with some bottle depots in Halifax, allowing community members to exchange their bottles and have the money from that exchange go directly toward an account in the United We Win Halifax's name to help sponsor the Abdille family.
 "The sooner we can get the money raised, the sooner we can (complete) the application and get things rolling," said Aalders, adding they want to sponsor other refugees, seeing how "the need is so great." Aalders acknowledged that the federal government has put its refugee resettlement programs on hold during the pandemic, but said he hopes they will be able to bring the Abdille family to Canada soon as possible. "They'll be able to (live) in a healthier environment and not have to worry about (Abdille) dying from not being able to breathe or (Nasteeh)," he said.
 'I would be really happy to see my family'
 With the poor housing conditions, dust and extreme heat at the Daadab refugee complex, Gele said she's concerned the respiratory conditions afflicting her brother and niece will only worsen, making them more susceptible to COVID-19.
 Gele had asthma herself, but recovered from the disease a year after arriving in Halifax. Living here, she said she's grateful to have access to an emergency room or a puffer if ever she experiences an asthma attack, but recognizes her family is not so lucky.
 Aalders said this is concerning, considering how the virus "could spread like wildfire" in a typically overcrowded refugee camp.
 Ultimately, Gele said she wants her family to be able to live in "good health," as she hopes for all people, and reunite with them in Halifax.
 "For 25 years, I haven't seen my parents or my brother or my family. I have seven children and my children have never seen their uncle or my parents, so I would be really happy to see my family," she said.
 "I want to say thank you so much to anyone supporting my family."
 Aalders said people can contact United We Win Halifax at unitedwewinhfx@gmail.com for more information about sponsoring the Abdille family or to pitch in for the bottle exchange initiative.

My grandmother used to can squash, but I never have. I just enjoy it while it is fresh.
 I only have a few zucchini plants this year. I’m not crazy about anything except zucchini bread so I don’t need many. I have a friend that makes zucchini pickle, however, and I always raise a few big ones for her.
 For some reason my peppers are not doing too well this summer. I keep the plants sprayed but some continue to wilt. And an old fox got the first pepper on the vine. She took one bite and left it there. I’ve really had to battle the animals this whole season.
 The watermelons and cantaloupes look good. They too were late going in the ground and some didn’t make it because of the rain and cool. Still, about 100 of each are thriving. And a second planting is doing well.
 My okra is starting to really take off and I should be getting the first within two weeks. About five (maybe six) years ago I took some old dried okra pods in late September, shucked the seeds and stored them in a sandwich bag in the refrigerator for the next year.
 Well, the next spring they were hidden behind something so I didn’t see them. Each year thereafter I meant to plant the seeds but didn’t. This year I figured they were no good but I threw out a few just to see what would happen. Every single one came up in less than a week. Like clover seed, those hard okra seeds seem to keep forever.
 My early crops were the best they have been in years. Tremendous potato crop, both red and white, and I’ll have to dig them in a week or so.
 Kale produced well and two fine rows of beets. I’m about ready to dig my onions, too.
 A groundhog got into the peas early but once he was dispatched I had plenty to eat.
 It has been a good season so far but I’m waiting for the tomatoes, sweet corn and watermelons.
 Good eating.

The Undertaker announced during the _Undertaker:_ _The Last Ride_ finale that he had no intention of stepping back in a WWE ring again, effectively retiring from the professional wrestling business. The final episode primarily covered Undertaker's final WWE match, the critically acclaimed Boneyard Match with AJ Styles at _WrestleMania 36_ back in April. Styles hasn't slammed the door shut on a rematch in interviews since then, and while speaking with Vincente Beltran this week he proposed offering "The Deadman" a shot at his Intercontinental Championship.
 "If I thought that would get him in the ring with me, in front of thousands of people, I would definitely put up the Intercontinental Championship," Styles said. "Will that happen, will he take the bait? Probably not. If he's decided that he's done, I respect that. He's definitely done enough in his career to say 'that's it, I'm done.' Trust me, I know what it's like.
 I can't imagine doing what he's done for so long, I really cant," Styles added. "The one thing he's earned is the right to call it quits on his own terms, but I would definitely offer him the opportunity,"
 Interestingly enough, the IC title is one of the few championships "The Phenom" never won during his WWE career. Winning that title would give him the prestigious honor of being a Triple Crown Champion, a feat many of his peers reached over the years.
 Undertaker, real name Mark Calaway, explained in the final episode that he felt the Boneyard Match was a perfect send-off for his character.
 "My career, my legacy, speaks for itself. At the end of the day that's really all that matters," Calaway said. "And I have this other life that I need to go and experience and enjoy the fruits of my labor, enjoy the blessings that I have -- my wife, my children."

 "I believe I'm at a place now post-Boneyard, it's like I just one a hellacious battle against one of the best in the business," he added. "Here you are climbing on your motorcycle and taking off. There was a lot of thought and a lot of emotion that went through my head. One of those being, are you happy enough with that? It was just a powerful moment, and you don't always necessarily get those. If there was ever a perfect to a career, that right there is it. If Vince was in a pinch, would I come back? I guess time will only tell there. In case of emergency break glass, pull out The Undertaker, I would have to consider that. Never say never. But at this point in my life and my career, I have no desire to get back in the ring."
 He concluded -- "I've got a pit in my stomach right now (chuckles). This time the cowboy really rides away."

The US government’s Commission for International Religious Freedom called it “a dangerous turn in the wrong direction as it runs counter to India’s rich history of secular pluralism and the Indian Constitution, which guarantees equality before the law regardless of faith”. The US State Department also said: “Respect for religious freedom and equal treatment under the law are fundamental principles of our two democracies. The US urges India to protect the rights of its religious minorities in keeping with India’s Constitution and democratic values.” One analyst drew parallels with Nazi Germany’s Nuremberg Race Laws on citizenship that provided the legal framework for the systematic persecution of Jews leading to the Holocaust.

And co-star Mark Salling, who Rivera dated at one point, killed himself in 2018 at age 35 after pleading guilty to child pornography charges.
 Rivera had experience boating on the lake in Los Padres National Forest, authorities said.
 Surveillance video shows Rivera and her son, Josey Hollis Dorsey, leaving on the rented boat.
 When the boat failed to return, its vendor found the vessel drifting in the northern end of the lake late Wednesday afternoon with the boy asleep on board. He told investigators that he and his mother had been swimming and he got back into the boat but she didn’t, according to a sheriff’s office statement.
 The boy was wearing a life vest, and another life jacket was found in the boat along with Rivera’s purse and identification.
 Rivera is believed to have drowned “in what appears to be a tragic accident,” the statement said.
 The boy, Rivera’s son from her marriage to actor Ryan Dorsey, was safe and healthy and with family members, authorities said. The couple finalized their divorce in June 2018 after nearly four years of marriage.
 The most recent tweet on Rivera’s account, from July 7, read “just the two of us” along with a photo of her and her son.
