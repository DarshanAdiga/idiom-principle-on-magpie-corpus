 In Dawson Springs, the Casey’s General Store closed over the weekend for in- depth cleaning even calling in a professional cleaning group.
 Mary Beth Drennan, the general manager for the store, said the outside team disinfected the entire store including gas pumps and the parking lot.
 “Things will not be taken lightly, we are very serious with the matter at hand,” she said in a Facebook post.
 The store opened around 6 p.m. on Saturday night after cleaning.
 “We were closed for 24 hours,” Drennan said on Monday. “ServPro was hired to come clean, and they did an excellent job. We are very pleased.”
 City and county establishments continue to limit the amount of traffic allowed in offices.
