Under the NYSE Rules, Federated Hermes is not required to have a nominating committee because it is considered a 'controlled company' for purposes of these rules. In light of this fact, Federated Hermes believes that it is appropriate not to have a nominating committee and, therefore, does not have a nominating committee charter in reliance on the NYSE Rules exemption. Federated Hermes' current practice is for the Board as a whole to perform the functions of a nominating committee.

The Commonwealth’s Attorney’s office nearby remained open for staff members Wednesday, but not for visitors.
 Cartwright serves on the Judicial Nominating Commission which will choose a new Hopkins County Circuit Court Judge. So far, the official calendar for that commission has not changed.
 “I’ve heard nothing,” Cartwright said.
 The deadline for recommending candidates was Monday, with questionnaires for the judgeship due Monday, March 30.
 Cartwright speculated the commission might decide the three finalists for Circuit Judge without gathering in Frankfort Monday, April 13.
 “They’re trying to do more telephonically,” Cartwright said.
 Governor Andy Beshear said late Wednesday that all state commissions will meet “virtually” instead of in person for the time being.
 Meanwhile, the Hopkins County Clerk’s office received a revised election calendar from the state Wednesday. Some things will change in the wake of the Kentucky primary being postponed.

 “We’re just playing it by ear right now,” Madisonville Country Club manager Mike Thomas said. “I’ve talked to several other courses who are staying open and several who are closing. I think ultimately, we’ll stay open and it’ll be good for the golf business. People will want to get out and get some fresh air when the weather breaks. There’s no large gathering involved, you play with three or four people at most. It’s about the safest thing that you can do.”

“In my gut, I’ve known it was coming for a while,” Oldham said. But the official shutdown notice for salons didn’t arrive until late Tuesday.
 Condra served customers by herself Tuesday evening inside the Hanson Walmart. But she already knew about Beshear’s announcement, thanks to a state association.
 “I have a hobby farm,” Condra said about her back-up plans. It includes an orchard and several horses near Providence. “I hope the Governor doesn’t forget about the farmers.”
 Condra’s customer count at Cost Cutters had dropped since the coronavirus scare developed, as Walmart shoppers focused on buying supplies. But she said her business still saw about 150 people a day.
 Oldham doesn’t know exactly how long Kentucky salons will be closed, but she fears it will be for more than a few weeks.
 “We just want to do the right thing and do what the Governor’s asked us to do,” Oldham said. “He’s looking at our best interests.”
 Her Wednesday clients included Lexie Wicks, whose fiance Coby Turner watched nearby. When it comes to a wedding, they may be wiser than many at this moment.

"Spot has now pushed below the 20 February lows at 1.0778. If sustained, this is the clear break lower we have been looking for." "Given the high degree of intraday volatility, we would like to see a weekly close below 1.0770 before drawing too many conclusions." "We do suspect, however, we are transitioning into a new, lower trading range. Our immediate focus now shifts to a test of 1.0570, although we note the early-2017 lows at 1.0341 could also come into view."
