Mack and Scott braced the Tigers with nine points apiece in the first half, and Clemson came out firing to start the second half, connecting on treys on its first two possessions. Also in the second half, Simms cut Clemson's deficit down to one by going on a 7-0 run by himself. The Tigers converted several turnovers into points in the second half, going up by nine with 5:15 remaining. However, the Yellow Jackets fought back and eventually closed out the game on a 6-0 run. Mack shot a potential game-tying 3-pointer at the buzzer, but it clanged off the iron, resulting in Georgia Tech securing the 65-62 victory.

Economic growth and rising disposable income is surging demand for automobiles in Asia Pacific, which is one of the major growth drivers of the reinforced plastics market. Additionally, increasing construction activities due to rapid urbanization in China and India are also boosting the reinforced plastics market. Volatile raw material prices and demand-supply gap in the raw material supply chain pose a challenge to the growth of the market. Stringent government regulations pertaining to feedstock in the U.S. and Europe further restrain this market. In the energy sector, wind energy is likely to provide momentum to the reinforced plastics market, opening new opportunities for market players. Using reinforced plastics for aerodynamically efficient blades improves the production efficiency of wind turbines, since blades made from reinforced plastics are lighter and are thus easier to propel. Further, R&D activities to develop reinforced plastics based on bio-composites will boost the reinforced plastics market in the coming years.￼

Battery systems built around zinc, they said, don’t catch fire like lithium- ion systems. The longer they run, the less costly they are in comparison. And zinc is cheaper and more widely available. It’s a pitch drawing interest not just in New York, which in January initiated a $2.55 million project with the winning startup. Canada and Indonesia are funding their own zinc-battery projects.

The controversial legal ­procedure involves defence ­lawyers being allowed to tell the jury about the victim’s sexual partners or what they were ­wearing at the time of the attack.
 This can often happen when the victim is being cross ­examined in the witness box.
 Keane, of Edinburgh Law School, said: “When there is a court application to challenge their sexual history we   believe there is a case for the ­complainer also having legal ­representation.
 “At present, the complainer is only represented by the Crown Office, which can oppose the application to admit their sexual history.
 “The complainer should not have to rely on the Crown Office to represent their best interests.
 “They should be allowed to ­represent themselves.”
 The use of a victim’s sexual ­history in court first came under fire in 2002 when Lindsay ­Armstrong, 17, took her own life after giving evidence against the teenager convicted of her rape in New Cumnock, Ayrshire.
 Her parents said the way she was humiliated in the witness box had been too much for her to bear.
 At one stage she was told to hold up the underwear she had been wearing when she was attacked.

Shit, I joked about this before, The Dementia Presidential Campaign, but I hope not. The quote at the start of the tweet gave me the creeps because I've just been there, done that, gone through exactly that recently in real life (and it wasn't pretty, can tear a family apart. there's no real tests, just the gerontologist's opinion, and guess what, they really are often hard of hearing in place with lots of ambient noise, you can't tell one from the other. If they are intelligent people, they also often reserve a instinctual capacity to hide from others what they know is happening). If this is really how the campaign goes, I am not going to want to pay attention, is too painful. If it's true, pray they both go away to retirement
