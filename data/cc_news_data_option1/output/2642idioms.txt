When Jimmy Wright come in the store, he looked mighty down in the mouth. I figured his gout had flared up again, but that weren’t it. Worse.
 Turns out, his best bird dog, Boscoe Smith, had got run over by a semi on route 17, and the opening of bird season weren’t but a week off. Now, in Eastern Carolina, openin’ day of bird season is bigger than Christmas and Easter rolled into one, so Jimmy was in a flat panic.
 He looks over at me right pitiful and says, “Charlie, you got any dogs you ain’t huntin’ this year?” I says I don’t, but I give him a lead or two. Two days later Jimmy comes back in. “Charlie, ain’t a dog in Currituck County for sale. I’m ‘bout lower than a gator’s belly.”

The remaining unemployment payment breakdown is $2.8 billion from the federal pandemic unemployment compensation package; $1.21 billion in the federal pandemic unemployment assistance package; and $86.3 million in pandemic emergency unemployment compensation.
 That means that 71.1% of unemployment insurance payments to North Carolinians are coming from federal sources, mostly the $600 weekly benefit.
 What makes that percentage critical for unemployed or furloughed North Carolinians is that federal benefits could expire as early as July 25 unless extended by Congress.
 Some small businesses in North Carolina, particularly restaurant owners and hospitality operators, have expressed concern that employees would prefer to draw $600 in weekly federal benefits rather than return to a job that may pay half of that amount.
 The $600 figure was passed — barely — in Congress as a national level benefit to get the payments out quickly rather than determine payments by individual states.
 The Democratic controlled U.S. House has passed a bill that would offer a new round of benefits.
 Some members of the Trump administration are considering another federal stimulus package, while the Republican controlled U.S. Senate did not take action on the House package before heading into a two-week recess. Some GOP senators favor a reduced federal benefit, perhaps as much as half.
 North Carolina's U.S. senators Richard Burr and Thom Tillis have not commented publicly on whether they favor extending the federal benefits.
 “There are legitimate concerns that the temporary increase in unemployment insurance benefits is discouraging some workers from returning to employment,” said Gus Faucher, senior economist with PNC Financial Services Corp.
 “But, there will be a huge drop in income when those benefits expire at the end of this month that will weigh on consumer spending and slow the recovery.
 “So, I think some sort of extension of the expanded unemployment insurance benefits beyond July 31 would be good for those workers, but also for the economic recovery.”
