Heading into this weekend, four-time national Formula 500 champion Liam Williams finds himself in a very unfamiliar position on the back of two feature race defeats. After finishing second in the Queensland F500 Championship two weeks ago, Williams again found himself relegated to a runner-up finish in Toowoomba last weekend when he couldnâ€™t keep pace with James Kennedy. Both Kennedy and Williams are in the field for the opening round of the Touch Ups Done Right Formula 500 Series, along with Ryan Newton, who has twice finished third behind Williams this season to emerge as a new threat to the established order, which includes series regulars such as Kristin Brown, Brady Argles and Tarhlea Apelt.
