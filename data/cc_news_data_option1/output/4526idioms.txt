We all know Thanksgiving is going to look different this year. Many of us will be celebrating with loved ones on Zoom rather than in person. So how can you feel more connected while eating apart? Associated Press food writer Katie Workman suggests coordinating the menu and using some of the same family- favorite recipes. Consider ordering food for loved ones who don't cook. She suggests having matching Zoom backgrounds, playlists — even table items like cheese boards. You can play games over Zoom and talk together about what you're thankful for. Don't hesitate to put your laptop or device at the head of the table for the best view of everyone.

Shortly after Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández asked neighboring Guatemala for help rescuing residents stranded near their shared border Thursday, Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei said at least 50 people had been killed in landslides in his own country, most of them in a remote town rescuers struggled to reach. Guatemala’s national emergency agency later said only that at least 50 people were missing in San Cristobal Verapaz.
 The U.S. National Hurricane Center forecast that parts of Nicaragua and Honduras could receive 15 to 25 inches (380 to 635 millimeters) of rain, with 40 inches (1,000 millimeters) possible in some isolated parts. On Friday morning, the storm was centered 65 miles (105 kilometers) east of Belize City.
 A week of rain spoiled crops, washed away bridges and flooded homes across Central America. Hurricane Eta’s arrival Tuesday afternoon in northeast Nicaragua followed days of drenching rain as it crawled toward shore. Its slow, meandering path north through Honduras pushed rivers over their banks and pouring into neighborhoods where families were forced onto rooftops to wait for rescue.
 Marta Julia Portillo, 62, fled her San Pedro Sula neighborhood before dawn Thursday with relatives. They paused at a gas station on dry ground until they were told to move on.
 “We don’t know where to go because we don’t have any place to shelter,” she said. Her son, who stayed behind at the family home, told her water was up to the third floor.
 “I would say the national capacity has been overwhelmed by the size of the impact we are seeing,” said Maite Matheu, Honduras director for the international humanitarian organization CARE. The group was using its network of contacts in Honduras to identify the hardest-hit areas and catalogue their most-pressing needs.
 Honduras Foreign Affairs minister Lisandro Rosales said via Twitter that “the destruction that Eta leaves us is enormous and public finances are at a critical moment because of COVID-19, we make a call to the international community to accelerate the process of recovery and reconstruction.”
 Observers are already anticipating that the havoc wrought by Eta will pressure more people to migrate from countries that are already some of the primary senders of migrants to the United States border in recent years.
 “Now with this situation, this is going to be an exodus, a massive exodus of migrants toward the north,” said Matheu.
 Early Friday, Tropical Depression Eta had maximum sustained winds of 35 mph (55 kph) and was moving north at 7 mph (13 kph). The forecast had it strengthening to a tropical storm before nearing the Cayman Islands Saturday and crossing Cuba Sunday. From there it could reach Florida or at least come close enough to assure heavy rains.
 “Whatever comes out (of Central America) is going to linger awhile,” said Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach. “I’m not convinced we’re done with Eta.”
 That’s because what’s left of Eta still has spin, which is hard to kill off, and that should help it reform, said NOAA hurricane and climate scientist Jim Kossin.
 Once it reforms and heads toward Cuba, it could meander in the area for awhile.
 “The winds aren’t going to be the problem. The rains are going to be the problem,” Klotzbach said.
 Eta will be so big, wet and messy that it doesn’t have to make landfall in already rain-soaked South Florida to cause a mess, Klotzbach said.
 “Slow-moving sprawling ugly tropical storms can certainly pack a precipitation wallop even if it doesn’t make landfall,” Klotzbach said.

 “It is just the way it is and we have a lot of games between now and the 30th of December.

 UEFA's proposal to change the handball law to prevent unfair decisions damaging the sport will be assessed by world football's rulemaking body, FIFA President Gianni Infantino said in correspondence seen by The Associated Press. Responding to a letter from UEFA President Aleksander Ceferin, Infantino said FIFA is striving for 'fairness, consistency and transparency' with the on-field regulations that are deliberated over intensely. Ceferin had written to Infantino last week seeking a return to the pre-2019 law that allowed referees to judge whether handling was intentional or accidental and prevent the current spate of 'many unfair decisions.' Ceferin was sent a reply after his request to FIFA was obtained by the AP on Thursday, with assurances received that the UEFA suggestion will be discussed by the International Football Association Board meetings later this month. 'This is not the first time this rule has been the focus of discussion and I believe that it will not be the last time,' Infantino wrote to Ceferin. 'I for one believe that the intensity of debate over this particular area of the game illustrates well the passion for our sport and the subtleties that make it so compelling.' The change to the law from 2019 determined that an offense was committed if players' arms were outstretched, in an unnatural position, when hit by a ball. 'There is no shame in admitting that sometimes decisions that are made for the good do not achieve their objectives and should be reviewed,' Ceferin said in last week's letter sent to Infantino. The configuration of the laws is overseen by the International Football Association Board. FIFA controls half of the eight IFAB votes and the English, Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish associations hold the other four. Infantino told Ceferin that his proposal has been forwarded 'to the relevant teams within the FIFA administration and have requested that it be made known to IFAB and that it be presented to the relevant bodies.' IFAB's technical and football advisory panels meet this month ahead of the 134th IFAB annual general meeting early next year. Infantino told Ceferin he had been reliably informed that 'handball as referenced in your letter will be included on the agenda.' 'As you have correctly pointed out,' Infantino said, 'our focus should not only be directed towards considering the potential of changes proposed but also towards considering the efficacy of changes made.'
