Roxana wrote a post on Facebook about her experience.
 "He also mentioned that he was watching me from afar. I was also absolutely alone. So although there were plenty of people 'loitering,' as the officer called it, he only had jurisdiction to issue me a ticket because I had my dog with me."
 According to the Town of Aurora’s website, all parks are closed, however, "trails are open for use and residents may utilize the pathways to walk through the parks. Please practice social distancing when using Aurora's trails and do not use park benches and picnic tables and avoid all high touch surfaces on your journeys."
 Roxana followed up with an email to the town's bylaw manager, Alexander Wray, to ask why Munguia was not wearing personal protective equipment and not adhering to physical distancing rules. Wray responded bylaw officers may break physical distancing in order to do their jobs, but didn't make it clear why he wasn't wearing PPE. A city spokesman told the _Sun_ it's up to individual officers to decide.
 "The town has made it clear that only trails and pathways are open to be walked on" and that officers are enforcing the bylaw "given a lack of compliance in the community," Wray wrote in the email.
 Aurora Mayor Tom Mrakas said he doesn't have jurisdiction to revoke the ticket and that the town's legal counsel has advised staff not to discuss the details of the case because the ticket will be fought in court.
 Mrakas admitted in a phone interview Tuesday having the parks closed and yet the walkways open is "confusing."
 "My understanding is if you're not on the walkway, then you're in violation," he said. "We have hundreds of kilometres of trails that are still open, but we explain to residents, stick to pathways if possible. We also don't encourage people to use pathways in the parks. If they have to go through them, they're there and you won't get ticketed if you're on a pathway, but parks are closed."
 The mayor said under the provincial orders, people won't be ticketed by moving aside to make room for people coming towards them.
 "If you're going to walk through the park, it's not to stand in the park," he said. "How long does it take for someone to walk by and then you just jog back in?"
 The Town of Aurora would not get into the specifics of Roxana's case, citing privacy issues, but said "parks and facilities have clear and visible signage indicating closures and an education campaign about the closures and provincial orders was done."
 Since March 25, Aurora's bylaw services has received 171 formal complaints from people breaking physical distancing orders, resulting in 61 charges, or 2%.
 Michael Bryant of The Canadian Civil Liberties Association said this problem of "ticketing first, asking questions later" is widespread during the pandemic.
 "I think it's a combination of general COVID anxiety (officers) are under and power-tripping, which arise from these new powers," he said. "There is an apprehension of abuse of process, if not political pressure put on them to ticket people, because mayors, councillors and cabinet ministers writing directly to the chief of police and bylaw officials about enforcement. This is not constitutional kosher. Politicians cannot be directing police."
 Brian Gray, a spokesman for the Ministry of Attorney General, said the province announced in March it was suspending timelines under the Provincial Offences Act and related proceedings.
 "As such, defendants who are charged with an offence during this period and wish to exercise their options on the back of a ticket will have an opportunity to do so once the state of emergency is lifted and statutory timelines resume," said Gray.
 Roxana said this was the first time in weeks she left the house to get some exercise. She had been told fresh air was good for her to ease her anxiety, on top of having been cooped up in the house with a newborn and recovering from bronchitis for months.
 She said she wonders if there is a broader problem of officers not being adequately trained.
 "In a time when there's a lot of tension, to scare people by randomly handing out tickets is absolutely inappropriate," she said.
 "This is fear-mongering at its finest. I was told I was still allowed to walk in the park but I guess that's not absolutely true. I got a ticket for social distancing, minding my own business and having a dog. That was my crime."

School vacation week lost some of its cachet in mid-March when Gov. Charlie Baker ordered the doors of all schools closed.
 The classroom shutdown started with three weeks. Then it turned into another month.
 This week -- the week when some students and families were supposed to be jetting off to Disney World, not fine-tuning their at-home learning schedules -- school closures became permanent, until at least the fall.
 "This does not mean it's time to start summer vacation early," Baker said Tuesday, pushing for continued remote learning and district planning for summer education to make sure students don't fall too far behind.
 With no way to ensure that school buildings could be safely reopened, the governor's decision to shutter classrooms for the remainder the academic year underscored how residents of Massachusetts are now being asked to settle in for the long haul -- just as patience is beginning to wear thin.
 Patriots Day 2020 turned out to be another one to remember, for all the wrong reasons. There was no thrilling finish to the Marathon on Boylston Street, no heartwarming tales of perseverance to complete the grueling 26.2-mile trek from Hopkinton. And while the weather was decent, there were few places to go to enjoy it, and if you found one, you probably went alone.
 There's always next year, as they say, or in this case September.
 But so far the Legislature still hasn't gotten around to passing the governor's bill to schedule a special marathon holiday for Sept. 14. And maybe for good reason. With a virus resurgence possible in the fall, Berlin called off its September marathon and Boston Mayor Marty Walsh could offer no assurances this week that Boston's rescheduled road race would go off.
 Ideas of when and how to reopen parts of the economy are starting to be discussed and floated at the national and state levels. And some states, like New Hampshire, are closer than others to pulling the trigger.
 Baker said Tuesday that at some point he will gather the "best and brightest minds from our business and public health and academic communities to work together to put together a thoughtful framework that can work in Massachusetts." But for now, the governor said the focus needs to remain on getting through the surge.
 "No one anywhere in the world, much less in the United States, has suggested that it's a good idea to get into the business of giving up on distancing and the stay at-home advisories and all the rest until you get to the other side of the surge," Baker said when asked about relaxing social distancing rules so people could get haircuts.
 That isn't stopping some from beginning to think through the logistics. The Massachusetts Gaming Commission, for instance, is attempting to draw lessons from Macau, China about how to reopen a casino. And the Massachusetts High Technology Council offered a seven-point framework for how commerce might be jump-started down the road without risking another outbreak.
 Bain Capital executive and Celtics co-owner Steve Pagliuca helped put together the checklist for the MHTC that suggests ramped up testing, virus therapies and contact tracing will all be needed before certain businesses can start to reopen.
 And even then he said it's likely workers will have to wear masks, lunch rooms will be closed and employees could be cycled through offices to allow for distancing. The state will also need a plan for public transportation to be accessed safely, and for day care centers, now closed through June 29, to reopen for working parents.
 So much for the White House's recommendation of just 14-days with declining new cases.
 "Maybe the 14-day flattening is a necessary, but not a sufficient condition to open up," Pagliuca said.
 The state's streak of declining new cases of COVID-19 ended Wednesday at five days. But even though caseloads (and testing) increased to close out the week, hospitals have seemed well-equipped to get to the bottom of the curve.
 The Department of Public Health's most recent report shows that over half of all non-ICU beds and two-thirds of ICU rooms remain unoccupied. It's to the point where six Boston teaching hospitals banded together to put together a public service announcement encouraging people that need non-COVID 19 care to seek treatment and not be afraid.
 "We have space," Baystate Medical Center President Nancy Shendell-Falik said. "We have changed our processes to ensure your safety and encourage you to seek necessary care."
 It was not too long ago -- April 7, to be exact -- that a panel of doctors convened by DPH Commissioner Monica Bharel put together guidance for hospitals should they need to start rationing access to life-saving treatment and equipment, including ventilators.
 Fast forward a few weeks and Bharel triumphantly returned to the briefing podium this week after a round of media interviews where she described her own "frightening" brush with the virus. And those standards?
 "I don't think we will need them," Dr. Robert Truog, director of the Center for Bioethics at Harvard Medical School, told the Public Health Council.
 But just in case, that same panel of medical experts that put together the original crisis standards of care revised them this week to lessen their bias toward younger, healthier patients that contract COVID-19.
 The first set of standards prioritized the number of life-years that could be saved. It was not a unique system among states, but one that was almost immediately criticized here as unfair to minority communities that have higher rates of chronic disease and underlying health conditions.
 Those standards were updated this week to refocus on a patient's chances of near-term survival, defined as their likelihood of living past the next five years if they could beat COVID-19.
 The end of the surge and the reopening of businesses can't come soon enough for the now more than 650,000 workers in Massachusetts who have filed claims for unemployment benefits, and the more than 200,000 self-employed workers now seeking aid under an expanded program launched Monday to cover a previously ineligible segment of the workforce.
 While the number of new claims are declining, another 80,000 people newly sought benefits last week, and the volume is taxing the state's unemployment insurance system. The UI fund's balance has dropped by half to about $750 million as unemployment skyrocketed, and the Baker administration has already applied for a loan from the federal government.
 The state estimates it will need an advance of $900 million from Washington to cover May benefits and another $300 million for June.
 At least the pension fund, according to Executive Director Michael Trotsky, is not facing any liquidity issues.
 Members of the Legislature are not at risk of being laid off, their existence constitutionally protected. But they're not immune from the struggles of adapting to a remote work life. Speaker Robert DeLeo said a plan for virtual voting is still two to three weeks away, so in the meantime the Legislature is sticking with what it can build consensus for.
 Bills to allow for virtual notarization and to strengthen local boards of health were sent to the governor, while the House passed legislation to increase state data collection and reporting on COVID-19 cases, and the Senate voted to expand eligibility for transitional assistance programs.
 And Gov. Baker signed into law a temporary moratorium on evictions and foreclosures.

While company officials work on those, we'd urge them to keep in mind the possibility of other improvements they could make. There may be new innovations for processing equipment, new modern procedures for cutting, new methods for receiving hogs and shipping finished goods.
 We also believe there are lean (no pun intended) manufacturing processes that could increase efficiency. There may be better human resource practices that could improve safety or morale.
 The focus of safely returning the plants to operation is the priority now. But the creative thinking that goes into that process could very well yield other improvements that would make the plants much better in the long term.

Cereal, crackers, fruit juice and laundry soap could be taken off the shopping list for many local residents Monday.
 But it came at the price of patience. Waiting in line for their turn.
 The Coldwater Area Ministerial Association -- CAMA -- was able to purchase these supplies at a very reasonable price, said Harold Jewel, pastor of Oasis of Love in Coldwater.
 They wanted to share.
 "We're keeping it simple," Jewell said. "No strings attached. We're having a good time serving Jesus and helping people."
 Distribution was at Coach Eby Center and cars snaked through the post office parking lot to the east side of the Eby Center. Confusion over the start time varied from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. so at 9:30 a.m. the team of about 25 volunteers from local churches had already loaded many cars.
 Many more waited in line on Pearl Street several blocks east of the post office.
 "It's been non-stop," Jewell said.
 From a 250 gallon tank of liquid laundry detergent, volunteers filled containers for those who brought their own jugs. Some brought extra containers for others who might have forgotten.
 All the items were popular, Jewell said, but it seemed laundry detergent was the most in demand.
 That was fine with them. Jewell surmised it could take days to empty the drum.

Andrew Scheer, a capable politician, is carrying the weight of his party on his shoulders and his "no comment" when asked about Sloan was a disappointing cop out. Party brass, of course, could act on a complaint about Sloan and decide that racist comments are incompatible with Party values.
 Perhaps the best way to discipline Sloan is to just let him finish last. He does seem to want to go out in a blaze of glory and appears to be almost begging to be handed some moral high ground about freedom of opinion.
 Conservative members showing him what they think of him will carry more authority than a decision by the leadership committee. Caucus, though, could and should still act.
 That leadership committee should also be paying close attention to what's happening to its party right now. It should indeed move as rapidly as possible. Exceptional times require exceptional methods.
 Having provided extra time to sell memberships that could no longer be sold in person, there's no need to keep pushing back the choice of a new leader.
 If the Conservatives hope to have time to mend fences with sections of the electorate hurt by the many slights of the recent past, they need a new leader and that can't wait for an in-person convention.

I recognize the danger in trying to point to the upside of a public health crisis that has claimed so many lives, left millions to shelter in their homes and, at least temporarily, left the economy reeling.
   
 But from moments like these, I recognize, some good always emerges.
   
 It was our collective reaction to terrorism, for instance, that propelled thousands to careers in public service.
   
 We've seen it again in this time of global challenge in the form of health care workers volunteering their services to work on the front lines.
   
 We've seen teachers reaching out to their students. And we've seen businesses, nonprofits and universities marshal their resources to build face shields for first responders and health care workers.
   
 Strangely, I've been struck by what might seem like a far smaller change emerging from this new coronavirus.
   
 We still argue politics and express differing views as fiercely as ever. Check social media if in doubt.
   
 But I have been struck repeatedly by a certain elevation of our personal discourse. Phrases like "Have a good weekend" or "Take it easy" have been replaced by "Be safe and take care of yourself."
   
 As a journalist, it's my business to be dubious. But it's hard to ignore both the frequency and the apparent sincerity of these messages.
   
 We are asking about one another's children, inquiring about the elderly parents and relatives of the people we talk to on the phone. People who are only vaguely aware that my wife works in health care go out of their way to make sure she's doing OK.
   
 I don't leave my house much these days, but my work has me talking to people on the phone every day. Almost without fail, the person on the other end of the phone asks how I'm doing and waits for the answer.
   
 Maybe I'm wrong, but I have a strong sense that good wishes for one another's health add up to something more than a new form of pleasantry.
   
 Rather, I suggest this common experience has woven us together a bit more tightly and increased our capacity for empathy.
   
 Ties are often born of shared experience -- soldiers who go into battle together, siblings who grow up in the same impoverished household.
   
 At this moment, we are bound together by common experience, shared worries and hopes for emerging from all of this unscathed.
   
 And it's made us a little closer, I think.
   
 I only hope those feelings of compassion endure long after this chapter of history is just a memory.

 What is the status of Smokestack Urban BBQ?
 Before COVID-19, Smokestack was great. The [Worcester Public] Market had just opened. We saw a dip in the neighborhood when Kelley Square construction started, whereas sales had maintained through construction of the ballpark. With Kelley Square, it was nothing too serious, but the lunch sales weren't quite where they had been. Obviously, when the Market opened, it was huge. The momentum and the business was cranking in the Canal District again. Now, because of COVID-19, it's not. We are taking the time to do some renovations in the Smokestack kitchen. We're working on new floors and other projects that can't happen when we're open. We're looking forward to reopening because take- out has been good and should allow us to bring staff back to maintain business. Not all restaurants can just slide out a take-out model. Luckily, barbecue is perfect for it. We already did a ton of takeout as it was. For us, it was a seamless transition -- you know, with 50% less sales. Not everyone's in the same boat.
 I was excited to learn that you and Richard Romaine are opening a new restaurant at the former Dacosta's. What is your relationship with him?
 I worked at Rich's restaurant Romaine's when I was in high school. I went to St. John's and it was right down the street. My brother worked in the industry. I got to know Rich over the years. I stayed in the restaurant business versus going to college. I bought some property after I had a decent job. My first real cooking job, making a decent income, was at Joey's when it was on Mill Street. I said, "You know what? I'm not going to do the school thing. I'll stick it out here." I knew I didn't want to be a line cook forever. I tried to stay business focused and I saw Rich as a businessman. He's been such a great influence and mentor. We own Smokestack together. It's been eight years and it has been a great run. When we moved from Harding Street to Green Street, we never thought we'd be anywhere near where we are now. We figured we'd be taking a step backwards, but it turned out to be a huge step forward. Our success there has been good and it will hopefully be even better with the Worcester Red Sox. After this crisis is all done, I predict it will have a forever effect on restaurants, but I think we will get back to normal in one way or another. It's going to take some time.
 How do you think that this crisis is going to shift the way that restaurants operate in our area?
 I wouldn't be surprised if masks become the new norm. People are sick of being inside. I think people who aren't at risk and are healthy are feeling especially sick of being caged up. They don't want to be told to stay home and they want to get out as soon as it's safe. It's just going to take a long time before we reach that point.
 What triggered your decision to buy Dacosta's and what's your plan?
 Well, Smokestack is Smokestack. It's great. But, like I said, I was ready to make a professional move for myself. Rich and I had looked at opening another Smokestack at Patriot Place. We weren't sold on the location with such high rent, so we put that on the back burner. For the past two years, pizza has become a real passion of mine. I was raised Italian American. I've done the R&D. I realized pizza was what I wanted to do. I got Rich on board and Dacosta's kind of fell into my lap. One man's trash is another man's treasure.
 The previous owner was certainly put through the ringer for some of his decisions. Did that concern you?
 I mean, It's all gonna work out. We've got our liquor license. We've got our building permits. We're ready to get into it. I was there today. I made a hundred pounds of dough for our April 26 pop-up. We're moving forward. We're in no rush at this point because of the virus situation.
 What is the goal of the pop-up?
 Giving people a taste. My personal friends and family know that I've been pursuing pizza for the past two years. I have a wood oven at home and everyone keeps telling me, "I can't wait to try it." We've got to give the people what they want. I'm looking forward to it. The pizza's killer. Dacosta's pizza was great. With the roots they've already planted and with what I know I can bring to the table, I am confident this is going to be a home run.
 That side of the city has a lot happening between the Trolley Yard and Greater Good.
 I caught the Canal District eight years ago right before it got its legs. And now, hopefully I can catch the Millbrook area with the same timing. We're going to keep the atmosphere going because you can't just make it on food and booze anymore. You gotta have some flair.
 What makes your pizza unique?
 Not many pizza places are using a sourdough starter. I am. That's a big difference. It's all about the process.
 Everyone seems to be a sourdough expert these days, so I bet that they'll appreciate that.
 Yeah, everybody's an expert on everything!
 When do you hope to open?
 We're looking to open in June. I want people to come to 'Olo and feel like they're sitting in my kitchen. They're going to be in my house in my backyard. It's not an Italian restaurant -- it's an American pizzeria.

Are we going to continue to turn a blind eye to other things we’re doing to endanger important species that we rely on for our very food source? The honey bee is our best and greatest pollinator. We need her to produce fruits, vegetables, herbs, nuts, berries and more. Are we really willing to sacrifice this amazing tiny and fragile creature for our own continued selfish purposes?
 Please don’t let this be another political issue. It’s a moral issue, and you are accountable. As a beekeeper, there’s only so much we can do to keep these precious pollinators safe. We tend the hives, we monitor for pests and diseases, we feed when there is a drought.
 But when the bees fly out to pollinate gardens, orchards and even plants we don’t eat or those that don’t produce a food source, they are subject to the chemicals that are on the buds. Can’t we look beyond our own selfishness and consider all that nature does for us in so many amazing and wonderful ways?
 I implore you to continue to keep a ban on harmful chemicals, that we don’t pollute our environment any further while there is still hope of forgiveness for what we, as a species, have already done. Please think carefully about this. You are representing the human race and it’s our proclivity to put forth ambassadors who will act in the best interest of the whole world. You have a very important task ahead of you. Please don’t let us down.

SHREVEPORT, La. -- How do you have a successful retail business in 2020? The answer to that question has dramatically changed since COVID-19 pummeled the nation.
 There's been motivation for retailers to move and expand their business models online for a long time. The COVID-19 crisis has put those ideas in overdrive.
 "We changed the game plan," said Carline Procell, co-owner of Bella Nonnas Olive Oil & Vinegar Tasting Bar.
 One of the biggest challenges is how do you get a large percentage of your customers who used to physically walk into a place and get what they want to move over to a computer screen or phone and do that same shopping online?
 "We've really had to adapt what customer service means. We try very hard to give them the experience they would get here," said Procell.
 And, because of that, "our online sales have just quadrupled. It's been insane," said Procell.
 But you don't just wake up one day and have an online business. First you have to create a website.
 "That would include a domain name, That would include web hosting," said Brad Pollitt, KTBS/KPXJ digital operations manager.
 Someone will need to build the website. Then an e-commerce website and a payment gateway. Theere's also shipping and fulfillment, privacy policies and terms of service -- all the legal stuff.
 That's a lot to deal with, right? Well, KTBS is in the process of trying to make it easier.
 "We're are going to launch within the next couple of weeks the KTBS Local Marketplace, and that will allow local businesses that don't have an e-commerce footprint to get up and running. To create that hyper-local feel for these businesses and allow them to quickly and easily be able to keep their business running online and keep that income coming in," said Pollitt.
 Whether business owners want to try the KTBS Local Marketplace or decide to go it alone, those in the know offer some advice.
 "For the businesses that are doing this on their own, make sure that you are vetting all of the vendors that you are using," said Pollitt.
 "If you're not technology savvy, find someone who is," said Procell.

The president said his administration would “take all appropriate action” to ensure that meat and poultry processors “continue operations” consistent with federal health and workplace safety guidance.
 While Trump said the step would ensure an ample supply of “protein for Americans,” the announcement provoked swift backlash from unions and labor advocates, who said the administration needed to do more to protect workers who often stand shoulder to shoulder in refrigerated assembly lines. At least 20 workers have already died of the coronavirus, the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union said.
 On Sunday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration issued guidelines calling for physical distancing and other measures to keep workers safe. But the guidelines are voluntary, and food safety and labor advocates said they feared that meat companies would not follow them.
 “Using executive power to force people back on the job without proper protections is wrong and dangerous,” Richard Trumka, the president of the AFL- CIO, wrote on Twitter, saying he echoed calls by the food workers union to “to put worker safety first.”
 Processing plants around the country have shut down amid outbreaks, putting a strain on the nation’s slaughtering capacity and prompting food companies to warn of coming shortages at supermarkets. Farmers have begun killing pigs and chickens they can no longer sell to companies for processing.
 As of Thursday, 13 meatpacking and food processing plants had closed at some point in the past two months, resulting in a 25% reduction in the nation’s pork slaughter capacity and a 10% reduction in beef slaughter capacity, according to the food workers union.
 In addition to the action, which was taken under the Defense Production Act, a Korean War-era law, the administration also planned to issue guidance from the Labor Department that would provide additional liability protections for companies seeking to operate amid the risk of outbreaks, a White House spokesman said.
 But it was still not clear exactly what the order would mean for a plant facing a coronavirus outbreak. In his remarks Tuesday, Trump did not clarify whether a plant with illnesses would have to reopen or whether his executive order would protect the industry against lawsuits. He said his administration was working with Tyson Foods, which has warned of coming shortages.
 “And we always work with the farmers,” he added.
 As states begin reopening, businesses have begun pushing the Trump administration and Congress to shield American companies from a wide range of potential lawsuits related to restarting the economy.
 Companies want assurances that they will not be held legally liable if a worker or customer contracts the virus at their warehouse, coffee shop or grocery store. That issue is expected to come to a head during the next round of congressional negotiations, with Republican lawmakers suggesting that any further aid to states would be conditioned on indemnifying businesses against lawsuits.
 Some of the nation’s largest facilities, run by companies including Tyson, JBS, Smithfield Foods, Cargill and National Beef Packing, have been shuttered as a result of outbreaks. Some plants have reopened, with partitions between workers on the meat line and health screenings for employees as they enter the plant.
 While companies have been drawing on stockpiles of meat in cold storage, they have warned that supplies to supermarkets could soon dwindle as plants remain closed amid illnesses. Pressure has been mounting on the Trump administration to take action.
 “It may take a while to manifest at the grocery store,” said John Newton, the chief economist of the American Farm Bureau. “But make no mistake, when you see processing capacity drop by 20 to 30%, it will ultimately have an impact.”
 In a full-page ad published in The New York Times and The Washington Post on Sunday, John Tyson, the chairman of the board of Tyson, said millions of pounds of meat would disappear from the supply chain as pork, beef and chicken plants are forced to close, leaving a limited supply of Tyson products available in grocery stores.

HOLLAND -- Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's executive order issued Friday came as a surprise to many nursery owners who were not expecting to be able to open until May.
   
 Whitmer extended the stay-home order related to the COVID-19 pandemic through May 15, but eased restrictions on some businesses that her office determined were lower risk.
   
 Lawn care companies, nurseries and golf courses that were previously closed are now able to reopen with strict social distancing measures in place for customers and employees.
   
 If they had some notice about the executive order, they would have been able to open on Saturday, said Jordan Miedema, a manager at JW Greenhouses with locations in Holland and Allendale. The soonest the garden center could reopen was April 28, he said.
   
 "The phone has been ringing probably more than any day ever -- people are excited," Miedema said. "We want to put people's safety first."
   
 Most local greenhouses opened over the weekend or are gearing up to reopen this week. The safety guidelines being enforced at JW Greenhouses are similar to other establishments and include six feet social distancing markers for customers, employees wearing masks, sanitizing carts before each use, and having hand sanitizing stations throughout the business.
   
 Countryside Greenhouse in Allendale opened its doors to customers on Monday with newly installed plexiglass by checkout stations and hand sanitizer for employees and customers.
   
 "We're seeing exactly what we truly hoped for," said Countryside owner Dale Buist on Monday. "People are here buying plants, but we're not overwhelmed with too many customers so people can be safely spaced out."
   
 Buist said customers should not be afraid of not being able to get the plants they want due to the temporary shutdown of nurseries. Some crops were lost, he said, but for the most part, people have "plenty of time" to get what they need.
   
 "Take your time, be safe, wear your mask and come out and enjoy the beauty we have to offer," Buist said. "Gardening is a good thing to do for mental and physical health. We believe we're an important part to people's home life."
   
 Countryside is denying customers entry to its business who are not wearing a face covering. The business hired a security guard to manage the entryway and make sure people are wearing masks. The governor's order requires people to wear face coverings in public enclosed spaces.
   
 "This is not a year about profit, it's a year about survival. We're hiring a lot more help than we normally would to do things."
   
 Jonker's Garden in Holland reopened Saturday for customers at its garden center, and continued its curbside service it started offering earlier this year. The business is requiring customers to wear masks inside of the indoor garden center, and encouraging patrons to don face coverings in the outdoor area as well.
   
 JW Greenhouses, with locations in Holland and Allendale, are also working on launching a website for curbside pickup, that should be up and running May 1, Miedema said.
   
 Having to be shut down for most of the month of April will be a hit financially, Miedema said, but most people do not buy flowers before the end of April anyways.
   
 "Moving it up a few days has helped us out an extreme amount," Miedema said.
   
 The greenhouse will be reopening with its regular hours. On Tuesdays and Saturdays, customers will also be able to purchase pre-packaged produce from Visser Farms and bread from The Great Bread Company at JW's Allendale location.

When the coronavirus first started to spread across the U.S., back before schools had shuttered and before we were told to stay at home, my then 4-year- old daughter looked at me one evening after overhearing the evening news on TV.      Her lip quivered and her eyes filled with tears.      "Mommy, am I going to get that virus?" she asked.      I assured my kids that no, the virus never makes kids very sick and that it's only the very old people or people with health problems that get seriously ill. While we still need to wash our hands and be careful about symptoms, I assured my kids that everything was going to be fine. I told them that life as we know it would continue.      Looking back, only two months ago, I had no idea that we would be where we are today. If only things were as simple as washing hands.      Things hit home for me in late March, when, while texting an old friend in the New York City area about the difficulties of trying to work from home while homeschooling the kids, she told me her 10-year-old son was sick. It was COVID-19. Because of the onslaught of the virus, it was almost impossible to find any kind of disinfectant, masks or gloves. The family had been staying home, much like we all are, and yet their son still got sick.      My kids started praying for the boy every night. I had some masks, extra Lysol wipes and hand sanitizer that I had bought back in February, and we packed them up, along with candy and homemade get-well cards that my kids made, and shipped the box to Brooklyn. Thankfully, the boy's symptoms were fairly mild, and after two weeks, the fever dissipated and he recovered.      But not every child has been so lucky.      Last week, 5-year-old Skylar Herbert in Michigan became the first child in the U.S. to die of COVID-19. Like so many other girls her age, like my own 5-year- old daughter - she loved dressing up and performing and loved all things "bling." A kindergartner, she loved going to school and began reading when she was only 4.      But last month she started complaining of headaches, the Washington Post reported. And within days she was hospitalized with COVID-19. She developed a rare form of meningitis, suffered from brain swelling and eventually was put on a ventilator to help her breathe. She did not survive.      She did not have any underlying health conditions.      The majority of the COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. have been people who are over age 60 or people who have underlying health conditions. But there have also been critical cases among the young and people without underlying health conditions who have also ended up on ventilators and some who have died.      According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there were 21,050 COVID-19 deaths as of April 22. Three of the deaths were in children age 14 and younger, 21 deaths in people age 24 and younger, and 585 of the people who died were between 25 and 44.      There is no sure way of knowing how many people ended up on a ventilator and survived, or how many people have actually had the virus. Without widespread testing, we won't really know how many people have antibodies or how many people have the virus but are asymptomatic.      In the last couple of weeks, people have protested across the country, saying that businesses should re-open and stay-at-home orders should be lifted for the sake of the economy and their personal rights to do business as they please. While states like Georgia have started to lift their business closures, despite not yet reaching a peak on COVID-19 cases, Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey announced last week that she will not lift the statewide stay-at-home order yet.   When she lifts the restrictions, Ivey said the decision will be based on data. Currently, the state is testing about 1% of the population for COVID-19, and Alabama doesn't have enough information right now about the number of cases out there to lift the stay-at-home order, Ivey said.   For that, I applaud her. I understand the need to reopen the economy and get back to a somewhat normal life. I look forward to the day when I can go back to work and my kids can go back to school. But until we are able to conduct widespread testing to know who for sure has the virus and how many people may be immune, we don't need to rush reopening business as usual, just for the sake of it.      Lives matter, lives like little Skylar Herbert. Lives like my kids', my husband's, our parents, my neighbors - lives like yours. Right now, without a clearer picture of cases, it's too much to risk.   Lydia Seabol Avant writes The Mom Stop for The Tuscaloosa News in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.

Like so many other girls her age, like my own 5-year- old daughter - she loved dressing up and performing and loved all things "bling." A kindergartner, she loved going to school and began reading when she was only 4.
 But last month she started complaining of headaches, the Washington Post reported. And within days she was hospitalized with COVID-19. She developed a rare form of meningitis, suffered from brain swelling and eventually was put on a ventilator to help her breathe. She did not survive.
 She did not have any underlying health conditions.
 The majority of the COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. have been people who are over age 60 or people who have underlying health conditions. But there have also been critical cases among the young and people without underlying health conditions who have also ended up on ventilators and some who have died.
 According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there were 21,050 COVID-19 deaths as of April 22. Three of the deaths were in children age 14 and younger, 21 deaths in people age 24 and younger, and 585 of the people who died were between 25 and 44.
 There is no sure way of knowing how many people ended up on a ventilator and survived, or how many people have actually had the virus. Without widespread testing, we won't really know how many people have antibodies or how many people have the virus but are asymptomatic.
 In the last couple of weeks, people have protested across the country, saying that businesses should re-open and stay-at-home orders should be lifted for the sake of the economy and their personal rights to do business as they please. While states like Georgia have started to lift their business closures, despite not yet reaching a peak on COVID-19 cases, Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey announced last week that she will not lift the statewide stay-at-home order yet.
 When she lifts the restrictions, Ivey said the decision will be based on data. Currently, the state is testing about 1% of the population for COVID-19, and Alabama doesn't have enough information right now about the number of cases out there to lift the stay-at-home order, Ivey said.
 For that, I applaud her. I understand the need to reopen the economy and get back to a somewhat normal life. I look forward to the day when I can go back to work and my kids can go back to school. But until we are able to conduct widespread testing to know who for sure has the virus and how many people may be immune, we don't need to rush reopening business as usual, just for the sake of it.
 Lives matter, lives like little Skylar Herbert. Lives like my kids', my husband's, our parents, my neighbors - lives like yours. Right now, without a clearer picture of cases, it's too much to risk.

The novel coronavirus has killed more than 210,000 people worldwide and infected over 3 million others, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.

Investors were unsure what to do with Wesfarmers ((WES)), which yesterday reported strong sales at Bunnings (might as well put those shelves up while stuck at home) and Officeworks (better upgrade my comms if I'm working from home) offset by weak sales at K-Mart and Target (stores closed). Perennial trouble child Target has really hit the skids. Lord knows why Wesfarmers has persisted with these two lookalike franchises all this time.
