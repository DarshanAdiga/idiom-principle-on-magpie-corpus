Max gets upset, realizing Isobel almost died during the abortion. He walks off needing time to think and completely misses Michael volunteering to donate his alien sperm or as she puts it his “alien baby gravy” (via a turkey baster) if Isobel really wants to be a mom. Michael tries to make light of his offer, but Isobel’s touched. “You would be an incredible father,” she says, holding his face. She adds, “Have I told you lately that I love you?”

The coming of summer on Cape Cod normally includes the anticipation of a new season of performance art for theatergoers. But in a marker of these extraordinary times, Cape Playhouse last week announced the postponement of its entire summer theater season, due to public health concerns surrounding the coronavirus. The Playhouse will carry forward the entire season to the summer of 2021.
 The season was to have featured three musicals and three plays, including the classic Noel Coward comedy "Private Lives," which originally premiered at the Cape Playhouse in 1940, starring Gertrude Lawrence. This year the Playhouse was planning to extend its season into September to add another show to its usual six presentations. That change will carry over to the 2021 theater schedule, with a repeat performance of the music-filled "Million Dollar Quartet" that played to rave reviews in 2018.
 This will be only the second time since its opening in 1927 that a Playhouse season has been canceled. The last time was during World War II when shows were on hold for three years, according to Joe Grandy, consulting producer for the Playhouse.
 Grandy said the Playhouse staff has been discussing "a million different scenarios" for what he called other "outdoor events and activities" that the public can enjoy during the summer at the 22-acre campus. Picnics or other events could also include their "campus partners" Cape Cod Museum of Art and Cape Cinema, as well as local area restaurants, for a variety of gatherings that can safely be held.
 During this shut-down the Playhouse has offered a series of free online youth classes in theatre arts via its website, and also held a recent flash fundraiser for Cape Cod Healthcare that raised more than $3,000 for local COVID-19 response.
 Of course, said Grandy, the virus closures have "changed the scene in multiple ways." Performing arts venues are reaching out to explore "what kind of a digital arm we can develop" to augment live theatre.
 But he feels that virtual images and performances will not replace the especially strong, in-person experience of live theatre.      "People," he said, "will come back" when it's safe and comfortable for them to do so. They want "to see things in person again" - hear the orchestra tuning up and experience the many small things about live theatre that "make it real."
 Grandy said his feeling about "live art" dates back to when he saw his first Van Gogh painting, hanging in a museum. "It was mind-blowing how different that experience was" from seeing an image on the printed page.
 "There's nothing like the magic of attending the theater," he said. The night you go "is made just for you - you're the only one to sit in that seat, on that night" and witness that unique performance yourself.
 The Playhouse and its board of trustees, in a May 6 press release, said they look forward to next year when the arts "can be enjoyed again - together."
 And, we add, accompanied by that amazing sound of applause on a summer night.

Verizon Business 2020 Data Breach Investigations Report found that confirmed data breaches doubled from the prior year. As the coronavirus pandemic has forced people indoors, cyber attacks on businesses are expected to climb.
 The report found that 86per cent of breaches were for money, not for purposes of spying. Credential theft, phishing and compromising business emails caused 67per cent of the cyber attacks.
 As more businesses moved to web-based solutions, so did hackers. According to the report, breaches on web and cloud applications rose to 43per cent, double the previous year.
 Companies like Facebook Inc and Salesforce have extended working remotely to at least the rest of the year, with more businesses expected to follow suit. Verizon Business Group CEO Tami Erwin said the "digital transformation" to the work-from-home model during the coronavirus pandemic has presented a number of security red flags.

Dysphagia assessments are carried out in a range of settings and may include examining a patient who has been ventilated as a result of Covid-19.
 The purpose of the examination is to determine what level of swallowing ability and communication a patient has and what help and rehabilitation may be required.
 Therapists also examine patients on stroke wards.
 ## 'A lot of anxiety'
 Ms Gallagher added: "Across the UK there is a lot of concern for our members.
 "They want to be able to do the right thing but are acutely aware of the risks to themselves and also the risk of possible transference to patients.
 "So there is a lot of anxiety on the ground.
 "The impact (of the assessment) means the person is safe to eat and drink. If they don't have it there is a risk the person could die from choking."
 As well as writing to Health Minister Robin Swann, the college has raised the issue with representatives on the Stormont health committee.
 "But we are 10 weeks into this now, which is why we felt we had to speak out," Ms Gallagher added.
 The Department of Health said in a statement that "ensuring front-line staff have access to the appropriate PPE is key to enabling health and social care colleagues to have full confidence in the equipment that we expect them to wear in such difficult circumstances".
 "Updated guidance was published on 2 April and reflects the need for enhanced protection in a wide range of health and social care scenarios.
 "The department has addressed the supply and usage of PPE and additional support has been provided to ensure HSC staff have the appropriate knowledge and understanding on the application of PPE in a range of scenarios."

Following a New Hampshire Fish and Game dive team search of the Upper Ammonoosuc River last week, two large granite bases and five marble stones that were once part of the Blake Cemetery were pulled up and transported to Berlin.
 They are being held at the Bryant Funeral Home for safekeeping until the town of Stark, which owns the cemetery that has been eroding for decades, moves forward on a plan to move the human remains and the markers still at the cemetery to another town-owned cemetery.
 The two granite pieces pulled up by the dive team on May 12 are called monument bases and would have been homemade, probably from someone repairing a stone that had fallen over, David Bryant, who helps direct and run the Bryant Funeral Home, said Monday.
 One monument base tops out at nearly 300 pounds.
 A piece of equipment called a monument dolly was used to move the heavy stones up the riverbank from the boat, and it took the dolly and four people to get it on the trailer, he said.
 “The others found were small and were marble and most likely some of those were to delineate the edge of a family lot,” said Bryant. “There’s no stone that has a date or birth or date of death. They are mostly plain with no lettering on them.”
 Three stones were found in the water and two on the bank.
 “Were there any human remains found, we could have taken custody of those and transported them,” said Bryant. “There were no remains found in the river, which was fortunate.”
 Bryant Funeral Home was asked by NHFG to help with storage and hold on to the bases and stones to make sure they weren’t vandalized or further damaged and to return them to town at the appropriate time, said Bryant.
 Hardware of some sort was also found during the NHFG dive search.
 “There was some other miscellaneous metal material found, most likely from the [adjacent] Blake Farm from the 1800s,” said Bryant.
 Based on a recent estimate by an engineer enlisted by the Stark cemetery trustees, in three to five years the river is expected to erode the bank enough to jeopardize the remaining graves above, Stark Cemetery Trustee Tim Emperor said after a May 6 Stark Board of Selectmen’s meeting.
 Trying to stabilize the riverbank and bluff, estimated at several hundred thousand dollars or greater, would be cost-prohibitive, concluded the trustees.
 Relocation of the Blake Cemetery graves and remains is estimated at $50,000 to $60,000.
 Bryant, the third generation to run the Bryant Funeral Home that has been in the family since 1966, said his funeral home and other businesses have discussed helping out the town the town of Stark, either through extending discounts or offering their time.
 Blake Cemetery, owned by the town since the 1940s, has about three dozen grave sites. Its earliest burials date from the 1700s and the cemetery includes the graves of several Revolutionary War soldiers as well as several soldiers who fought in the Civil War.
 After the cemetery’s condition gained wider publicity on May 1, the Charitable Trusts Unit of the New Hampshire Attorney General’s office wrote the Stark Board of Selectmen and cemetery trustees to say the condition is unacceptable, the town knew of the condition for decades, and municipalities are required under law to maintain their cemeteries by taxation or funding from other sources.
 Selectmen have acknowledged the erosion, but said vandalism also appears to have played a part in some fallen headstones.
 A call placed Monday to the office of the New Hampshire Attorney General inquiring about the skull found May 1 on the riverbank below the cemetery that was subsequently transported to the state medical examiner’s office for a forensic examination was not returned by press time.
 It’s currently undetermined if the examination has been completed, and if so, what is the estimated age of the skull and is it believed to have come from a burial in the cemetery.

ST. JOHNSBURY — The wheels of Rural Community Transportation (RCT) continue to go round and round.
 But not without major adjustment — and a lotof cleaning.
 Nick D’Agostino, CEO and executive director of RCT, said the public transportation service temporarily suspended some routes but people in need of transportation can call RCT to arrange pickup and drop off.
 The organization also provided a crash course in sterilization training to keep the riders and staff safe.
 “We basically started actively campaigning for people not to ride the bus unless they absolutely had to … If you don’t need to go somewhere, we don’t want you to ride the bus,” said D’Agostino. “We want to be taking essential workers to their jobs, and we want to be taking people to the doctor, things like that.”
 Face coverings are required by state order for everyone on public transportation, something RCT and the state public transit association pushed for, and clients have been happy to cooperate.
 The bus service offers free Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), thanks to Northeastern Vermont Regional Hospital helping out with a donation.
 D’Agostino said, “We started desperately trying to gather as much PPE as possible,” which includes masks, gloves and hand sanitizing solution and more disinfectant solutions to keep buses clean.
 “We are trying to have one person on one bus,” D’Agostino said.
 Buses are cleaned multiple times every day, and after every single customer, said D’Agostino.
 Plastic shields have been installed around the drivers, so there is a physical barrier around the employee now.
 Seats have been folded up so that riders are “forced to sit further back,” said D’Agostino.
 He said sometimes drivers have to be closer to a rider if they are using a wheelchair and require help getting on and off the bus.
 Drivers have N-95 respirator masks and the bus company now has enough supply of hand sanitizing supplies, as well as disinfectant for cleaning the vehicles.
 At the office, there is a skeleton crew, and most of the office staff are working remotely, said D’Agostino.
 The local bus routes now are mainly a Dial A Ride service, where people have to call and schedule a ride.
 RCT is the Medicaid transportation provider, and every passenger is asked questions such as if they have symptoms, if their appointments are still on, if they have been outside of Vermont and if so if they have self-quarantined for 14 days and more.
 If the person is symptomatic, non-emergency ambulances are provided, “We are not emergency transportation, so we are not transporting anyone who has COVID-19 or is symptomatic” or needs a ride to be tested, said D’Agostino.
 He said a handful of times people have needed to get tested, “That happened maybe four or five times.”
 “We’re having to adapt to what is going on,” said D’Agostino, saying no one is being denied transportation.
 D’Agostino said, “I think everybody, all the call center staff, the drivers, and even the people who are able to accommodate running from home to keep the organization running all deserve to be recognized … Especially the drivers who are out there.”
 One of those drivers is Brenda Rudinsky, of St. Johnsbury, who has worked for RCT for four years.
 “It’s the best job I’ve ever had,” said Rudinsky, cleaning her bus on a recent afternoon outside RCT, in the industrial park. “I love to drive, and I love people.”
 For Rudinsky, she said she considers it a privilege to provide critical transportation for the people who rely on public transportation in the Northeast Kingdom.
 “I’m so thankful to have a job still,” said Rudinsky, adding, “There’s so much joy in this job … there really is.”
