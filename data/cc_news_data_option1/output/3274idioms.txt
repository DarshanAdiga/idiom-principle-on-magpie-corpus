Crisis-hit Barcelona hailed the "return of a legend" as the Spanish giants on Wednesday officially named Ronald Koeman as their new coach through until 2022.
 "FC Barcelona and Ronald Koeman have reached an agreement for the Dutchman to take over as first team coach until 30 June 2022," the club said in a statement.
 Former Barca star Koeman, who has been in charge of the Netherlands since 2018, will replace Quique Setien, who was sacked after the Catalans were humiliated 8-2 by Bayern Munich in the Champions League quarter-finals on Friday.
 The 57-year-old, who becomes the fifth Dutchman to coach Barcelona after Rinus Michels, Johan Cruyff, Louis Van Gaal and Frank Rijkaard, will hold a press conference later Wednesday at 1600 GMT.
 "More than 30 years after his arrival as a player, Koeman arrives once again as coach at the club that he helped win their very first European Cup back in 1992," Barcelona said in a statement headlined "Return of a Barca legend".
 "Koeman, the hero of Wembley, is back," the club added, a day after president Josep Maria Bartomeu revealed the Dutchman would take over.
 That night back in 1992, Koeman secured his place in Barca history, scoring the winning goal to claim the Catalan club's first ever success in Europe's top club competition.
 As a player, Koeman arrived in Barcelona in 1989, at the time the second most expensive signing in the club's history behind Diego Maradona.
 In his six seasons as a Barca player Koeman made 264 official appearances, scoring 88 goals as he shone in Cruyff's 'Dream Team', winning four consecutive La Liga titles between 1991-94.
 \- Mixed coaching bag -
 Koeman's coaching career, however, has been mixed and he arrives with the Catalans in crisis.
 Setien was fired on Monday after the embarrassment against Bayern which meant Barca finish the season trophy-less for the first time since 2007.
 Earlier on Tuesday sporting director Eric Abidal was axed, paying the price for the Bayern trouncing and internal conflict that took place during a league season that saw them surrender the La Liga title to Real Madrid.
 Ex-France international Abidal was replaced Wednesday by Ramon Planes.
 Koeman will leave his role as coach of the Netherlands to his assistant Dwight Lodeweges, while the national federation searches for a full-time replacement.
 The Oranje take on Poland on September 4 and Italy three days later, in Amsterdam as part of the UEFA Nations League.
 "It was an honour to be the national coach of the Netherlands," said Koeman, who would have been in charge for the 2020 European championships, now postponed by a year because of the coronavirus pandemic.
 "For the past two-and-a-half years I have done everything I can to achieve successes with the Oranje.
 "I look back with pride on what we have achieved together in that period. The Dutch national team has a bright future, I am convinced of that."
 Koeman said that "everyone knows Barcelona is my dream club".
 "It feels very special to me to be able to become a manager there."

City leaders agreed on Aug. 3 to ask voters to authorize a lease after county commissioners requested some kind of property interest in the new senior center, planned for where the current one sits at East Front and Barlow streets.
 That question would’ve been tie-barred to votes for the two millages, meaning all three questions would have to pass for them to take effect, city Manager Marty Colburn said.
 Then, county commissioners wanted to adopt a 50-year lease — the county originally sought 99 — before deciding whether to put the millage questions before voters, Colburn said.
 “We were getting actually quite close but we got down to a timeline that was not manageable, especially for something that was so critically important on such a long-term lease,” he said.
 Colburn said he pulled the city out of a planned joint city-county meeting Aug. 11 — the day ballot language was due — after the time changed, and because city commissioners and the public would’ve had less than 24 hours to review the proposed lease.
 A few city leaders voiced their unhappiness with how their county counterparts didn’t seem to match the city’s efforts or earnestness in working together to build a new senior center.

The oil-rich United Arab Emirates announced Wednesday that it has connected its Barakah nuclear power plant to the national grid in a new first for the Arab world.
 The milestone follows the successful start-up of the plant's first reactor at the end of last month and launches the UAE on the road to meeting 25 percent of its electricity needs from nuclear power.
 "The safe and successful connection of Unit 1 to the UAE grid marks the key moment when we begin to deliver on our mission to power the growth of the nation by supplying clean electricity, around the clock," said Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation CEO Mohamed Ibrahim al-Hammadi.
 "We are confident in our people and our technology to continue to progress to reach... the completion of the remaining three units, with the goal to power up to 25 percent of the UAE's electricity needs for at least the next 60 years."
 The plant on the Gulf coast west of Abu Dhabi had been due to go online in late 2017 but faced a number of delays that officials attributed to safety and regulatory requirements.
 The UAE has substantial oil and gas reserves, but with a power-hungry population of 10 million it has made huge investments in developing clean alternatives, including solar energy.
 Barakah, which means "blessing" in Arabic, is a regional first.
 Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil exporter, has said it plans to build up to 16 nuclear reactors, but the project has yet to materialise.
 Barakah was built by a consortium led by the Korea Electric Power Corporation at a cost of some $24.4 billion.
 More than 950 kilometres (nearly 600 miles) of 400 kV overhead power lines had to be built to link the plant to the grid.
 Barakah's other three reactors are said to be almost ready for operation.
 Construction work has already been completed on Unit 2, and Units 3 and 4 are respectively 93 percent and 86 percent complete.
 The UAE lies just across the Gulf from Iran which has a nuclear power plant of its own outside the coastal city of Bushehr, as well as a controversial uranium enrichment programme.
 The UAE has repeatedly said its nuclear ambitions are for "peaceful purposes" and has ruled out developing any enrichment programme or nuclear reprocessing technologies.
 It has also moved to dispel any concerns over safety, underlining that the plant has welcomed more than 40 international reviews and inspection missions.
 Nearby Qatar, the target of a boycott by Saudi Arabia, the UAE and others since June 2017, said last year the Barakah plant poses a "flagrant threat to regional peace and environment".

This is more a question of what coach Matt Nagy and his new offensive staff, including line coach Juan Castillo, want to do in terms of creating the best package of plays for their quarterback. It’s different, too, when you evaluate Mitch Trubisky and Nick Foles and right now we’re left to wonder and see if there are any clues which direction they might lean with no preseason games to evaluate. You bring up an interesting point because Castillo was the offensive line coach in Baltimore in 2014 when Gary Kubiak served as the team’s offensive coordinator. He was the line coach for Buffalo in 2017 when Rick Dennison was the offensive coordinator. Kubiak and Dennison are both offensive guys who lean heavily on outside zone concepts, so Castillo is well-versed in anything Nagy wants to emphasize in the running game.
 How does outside zone vs. inside zone — which is what the Bears leaned on more last season — impact the quarterback? One reason to run an outside zone with an inefficient quarterback is the ride on the running back is longer. It doesn’t hit downhill. It’s wide. So, the ride is longer from the shotgun, the mesh point is longer, and if you are running play-action or a pun-pass option (RPO), the reads become more defined and the quarterback has more time to read it. The quarterback is riding the running back all the way outside, and his eyes up the field — especially on an RPO — and reading the conflict defender or linebacker, giving him more time to read it all. Is he running with the running back or is he staying home? If he stays home, you hand it off. If he moves, you’ve got a clear, defined window to throw the ball and you don’t have to read anything. The quarterback knows exactly where he’s going with the ball for a slant throw to Allen Robinson or whomever.

C’è chi invece dirà che senza il tocco geniale di Neymar questo gol non sarebbe stato possibile, che il talento alla fine trionfa sempre, e che nel calcio il talento solo i più ricchi possono permetterselo. Io, per il ruolo che ho, non posso che dare il giusto merito a Tuchel, che ha puntato quelle che dovevano essere le armi di Nagelsmann contro Nagelsmann stesso, con una squadra a cui fino a qualche mese fa sembrava impossibile dare una vera idea di gioco.

The current ratio is a measure of how well the company can take care of its short-term obligations, and it is typically considered "healthy" at 1.5 or higher. If the ratio, is too high, however, it might be an indication that a company is mismanaging or hoarding assets. Bristol Myers' current ratio, which is current assets over current liabilities, shows that it is capable of handling its debt load and keeping operations up and running. During the company's second quarter earnings call, CEO David Elkins pledged to bring down Bristol Myers' debt-to-EBITDA \-- a measure of how well a company can cover its debt -- from 3.8 to less than 1.5 by the end of 2023.

On one hand, they can take heart from the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) August oil market report, which was released last week, because it does see a slight supply overhang for the rest of the year. On the other hand, though, the slight downward revisions on demand could prove somewhat worrisome. The IEA forecasts oil demand for 2020 to come in at 91.9 million barrels per day (bpd), down by 140,000 bpd compared to a month ago. The agency equally trimmed down its 2021 forecast by 240,000 bpd to 97.1 million bpd. These forecasts stand against oil demand of about 100 million bpd in 2019.
