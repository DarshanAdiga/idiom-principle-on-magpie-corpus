The large conspiracy alleged here would necessarily involve infiltrating thousands of different election boards or jurisdictions.

GROSS: And they're shadowing your moves. So Nancy Franklin writes, (reading) The older couple - which is you and Donald Saddler - the older couple make gravity work in their favor. They dance together as two human beings, not as two perfect but easily replaceable instruments. Champion and Saddler, both of whom are in the ballpark of 80, are radiant. There's something in their eyes that is missing from the youth behind them. When the young man carries his partner off the stage on his shoulder, it's about for muscles. When Champion and Saddler glide off the dance floor, his arm wrapped around her, the counterpoint is deeply moving. He can't carry her off the stage, but he doesn't need to. Their movement expresses their love and support for each other. It's the most romantic moment in the show.

However, this also suggests that faith of voters in him is neither unconditional nor infinite.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrat Joe Biden was on the cusp of winning the presidency Friday night after he opened up narrow leads over President Donald Trump in critical battleground states.
   
 Biden had leads in Pennsylvania, Nevada and Georgia, putting him in a stronger position to capture the 270 Electoral College votes needed to take the White House. The winner will lead a country facing a historic set of challenges, including the surging pandemic and deep political polarization.
   
 The focus was on Pennsylvania, where Biden led Trump by more than 16,000 votes, and Nevada, where the Democrat led by about 22,000, as Americans spent a third full day after the election without knowing who will lead them for the next four years. The prolonged process added to the anxiety of a nation whose racial and cultural divides were inflamed during the heated campaign.
   
 Biden was at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, as the vote count continued, and aides said he would address the nation in primetime. Trump stayed in the White House and out of sight, as more results trickled in, expanding Biden's lead in must-win Pennsylvania. In the West Wing, televisions remained tuned to the news amid trappings of normalcy, as reporters lined up for coronavirus tests and outdoor crews worked on the North Lawn on a mild, muggy fall day.
   
 Trump's campaign, meanwhile, was quiet -- a dramatic difference from the day before, when it held a morning conference call projecting confidence and held a flurry of hastily arranged press conferences announcing litigation in key states.
   
 A handful of states remained in play Friday evening, with Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Nevada all too early to call. In all four states the margins between Trump and Biden were too narrow and the number of ballots left to be counted too great for the AP to declare a victor.
   
 In Pennsylvania, officials were not allowed to begin processing mail-in ballots until Election Day under state law. In Nevada, there were a number of provisional ballots cast by voters who registered on Election Day, and officials had to verify their eligibility. And recounts could be triggered in both Pennsylvania and Georgia.
   
 With his pathway to reelection appearing to greatly narrow, Trump was testing how far he could go in using the trappings of presidential power to undermine confidence in the vote.
   
 On Thursday, he advanced unsupported accusations of voter fraud to falsely argue that his rival was trying to seize power in an extraordinary effort by a sitting American president to sow doubt about the democratic process.
   
 "This is a case when they are trying to steal an election, they are trying to rig an election," Trump said from the podium of the White House briefing room.
   
 He took to Twitter late Friday to pledge further legal action, tweeting "Joe Biden should not wrongfully claim the office of the President. I could make that claim also. Legal proceedings are just now beginning!"
   
 Trump did claim that he won late on Election Night. He also tweeted that he had "such a big lead in all of these states late into election night, only to see the leads miraculously disappear as the days went by," although it was well known that votes cast before Tuesday were still being legally counted.
   
 Biden spent Thursday trying to ease tensions and project a more traditional image of presidential leadership. After participating in a coronavirus briefing, he declared that "each ballot must be counted."
   
 "I ask everyone to stay calm. The process is working," Biden said. "It is the will of the voters. No one, not anyone else who chooses the president of the United States of America."
   
 Trump's erroneous claims about the integrity of the election challenged Republicans now faced with the choice of whether to break with a president who, though his grip on his office grew tenuous, commanded sky-high approval ratings from rank-and-file members of the GOP. That was especially true for those who are eyeing presidential runs of their own in 2024.
   
 Maryland GOP Gov. Larry Hogan, a potential presidential hopeful who has often criticized Trump, said unequivocally: "There is no defense for the President's comments tonight undermining our Democratic process. America is counting the votes, and we must respect the results as we always have before."
   
 But others who are rumored to be considering a White House run of their own in four years aligned themselves with the incumbent, including Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., who tweeted support for Trump's claims, writing that "If last 24 hours have made anything clear, it's that we need new election integrity laws NOW."
   
 Trump's campaign engaged in a flurry of legal activity, saying it would seek a recount in Wisconsin and had filed lawsuits in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Georgia.
   
 But judges in the three states quickly swatted down legal action. A federal judge who was asked to stop vote counts in Philadelphia instead forced the two sides to reach an agreement without an order over the number of observers allowed.
   
 "Really, can't we be responsible adults here and reach an agreement?" an exasperated U.S. District Judge Paul S. Diamond said during an emergency hearing Thursday evening. "The whole thing could (soon) be moot."
   
 The Trump campaign said it was confident the president would ultimately pull out a victory in Arizona, where votes were also still being counted, including in Maricopa County, the state's most populous area. The AP has declared Biden the winner in Arizona and said Thursday that it was monitoring the vote count as it proceeded.
   
 "The Associated Press continues to watch and analyze vote count results from Arizona as they come in," said Sally Buzbee, AP's executive editor. "We will follow the facts in all cases."

"Every time we go out on the field, we have the mentality that we want it more than our opponent," said Fairmont Senior sophomore Kate Gribben before Friday's game. "And we've created a family bond and have just become a great team honestly."
 On Friday, that collective attitude and chemistry from the Lady Polar Bears were the seeds that turned them into a full-fledged powerhouse in their semifinal showdown against the favored Yellow Jackets. Their offensive attacks were pristine and precise. Their defense was sturdy and timely. And their midfield was feisty and enforcing.
 "This was kind of a take-care-of-business kind of deal today," said Jeff King, Polar Bears head coach. "I think everybody played a solid game today. There wasn't anybody who played weak today.
 "But you know what, I don't think we've played our best game yet, I think that's coming tomorrow."
 While FSHS's victory was earned by way of a true team effort that saw lots of players have their moments, it was senior star forward Tricia Lemasters who took the grandest spotlight. Lemasters, who awed with her refined technical skills and impressed with her canny body positioning, ripped Williamstown to bits all game long as she scored three goals and delivered an assist to play a key part in all four of Fairmont Senior's points. Time and again, Lemasters left Williamstown defenders dazed and confused as she wiggled into open space and shimmied into shooting pockets. She repeatedly roasted the Yellow Jackets backline, freezing defenders in 1-on-1 situations with nifty footwork to get a step and spurning them in off-ball scenarios to provide a passing outlet.
 Lemasters, who struck directly with goals in the 24th, 27th and 73rd minutes and recorded her assist on a score by Eden Williams in the 65th minute, was the Polar Bears' offensive fulcrum, but she was more of a comrade than a soloist in a Fairmont Senior offense that got contributions from across the board.
 "Tricia, she gets the accolades because she's the one out there putting the ball in the net," King said, "but it took 10 others players to get those balls up there to her."

Haven't we learned?
   
 We've all heard the old saying "you can't teach an old dog new tricks" or heard the Einstein quote "Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results," but did we understand what these mean? Based on the election results, we are expecting a couple old dogs to learn some new tricks!
   
 Over 53% of Illinois voters (47% of Sangamon County) didn't buy what Einstein was selling, as they voted for Senator Durbin! Isn't 37 years of nothing enough? What about the 55% (47% in Sangamon County) who voted for Joe Biden? He has 47 years with no accomplishments (nothing he wants to take credit for now). I know, you're saying 'wait a minute, hold your horses, they did accomplish something - financial success they're in the millionaire club.' But seriously, what am I missing? What have they accomplished?
   
 Reminder: "Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results." I don't know about you, but I'm starting to get concerned that we've got a lot of insane drivers on the road!
   
 I'm not here to debate that President Trump deserves another term, but not taking in to account what he's said, but honestly looking at what he has accomplished. If you can recall one, two or many - that's one, two or many more than Vice President Biden has accomplished. I think we can all agree that Albert Einstein was pretty smart, but why won't we learn from him?

by Timothy EganThe closest I ever came to death was when a ferocious undertow grabbed hold of my wife and I, carrying us out into the raging surf off Puerto Escondido, Mexico. We gagged, flailed and turned purple as we wrestled to stay afloat. Saved by a sandbar, I never looked at life the same way again. So we find ourselves today, still holding our breath, looking back at the bloodied mess of our tattered democracy. As exhilarating as it is to cheat death, we are diminished and badly shaken by what happened this week. Those of us in the business of crafting narrative from chaos are hard-pressed to say anything positive about the last few days. I nearly lost my faith in humanity, and certainly lost my faith in the polling industrial complex. I’m perplexed and humbled. “Stop the count.” Of all the violations of things that we hold precious in this country, this tweet by President Donald Trump on Thursday, demanding that millions of voters be disenfranchised so he can steal an election, is the one that will live in infamy. But let’s find some light in the darkness. Trump’s electoral ambulance chasing, the inchoate chants of supporters to simultaneously stop the count and count the vote (depending on the state) will change nothing. Joe Biden is winning the popular vote by close to a 3-point margin. That’s no small thing. John F. Kennedy won by less than 1 percentage point. Ronald Reagan rode into the White House in 1980 with just over 50% of the total vote. Bill Clinton became president with 43% of the vote in a race with three major candidates. A President-elect Biden would mean the first African American vice president in Kamala Harris. The first woman veep, as well. History, noted. It would mean the United States could again join the community of nations committed to saving this gasping, burning, overwhelmed planet. Public lands would remain in public hands. It would mean that the pipeline of partisan, retrograde federal judges would be shut off, for now. Ditto the Supreme Court, should Biden get a pick. It would mean science and truth would be guiding principles at the highest level of government — this coming just as we enter a long dark season of COVID-19 deaths because science and truth were ignored. It would mean that the executive office would no longer be actively fighting to take away health care from millions of Americans. Think about a springtime that could bring a coronavirus vaccine, a revived economy and a restoration of decency and civility. Looking at the bigger picture, Democrats were done in by extreme voices that Trump was able to link to their party. Defunding the police will never be popular outside a few lefty precincts. The whiff of socialism helped kill Democrats in Florida. In California, voters rejected ballot measures that would have delivered a return of affirmative action and a bill to expand rent control. The result was a wake-up call for the overly woke. In battered Portland, Oregon, where violent clashes between protesters and law enforcement have brought terror to the streets, a candidate who embraced antifa lost to the more moderate mayor, Ted Wheeler. The violent fringe on the left helped Trump. The violent fringe on the right, sadly, did not appear to hurt him. In the closing days of this campaign, the president appeared to lend his support to a truck brigade that had tried to run a Biden bus off the road in Texas. He suggested locking up his political opponents and reveled in crowds chanting to fire the nation’s foremost infectious disease expert. But let’s look to better days ahead and begin repairing our broken democracy. A presidential candidate could win the popular vote by nearly 5 million votes, but depending on where those votes are cast, he or she could still lose in the archaic Electoral College, the fortress for the tyranny of the minority. Only once in the last 30 years have Republicans won the popular vote. There is still a possibility that this election could end up in an Electoral College tie of 269 to 269. If that happens, the next president would be determined by the new House of Representatives, with each state casting one vote. Thus, California, where nearly 1 in 8 Americans live, with 53 members in the House, would have the same power as Wyoming, a state with a lone representative in the House and a declining population. The obvious flaw here — that the person who gets the most votes does not necessarily win — could be neutralized by the National Popular Vote Compact, in which all of a participating state’s electoral votes are pledged to the winner of the national popular vote. On Tuesday, Colorado voters approved joining the compact, which now has 15 states plus the District of Columbia, representing 196 electoral votes. More states are needed to push it past the 270-vote margin where it could go into effect. But for now, it’s the best vehicle for bringing the American system closer to one that reflects the will of the people. Ah, the will of people. Who knows what the hell that is. Yes, it’s karmic justice that three of the states pivotal in electing Trump — Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan — now look like three that will fire him. And for that slim majority, and the rest of us, may mourning in America soon turn to morning in America.

Although we can certainly learn facts from fiction, most people come to novels for entertainment and pleasure. We want to get lost in the story. Inhabiting characters and living their desires is a boundless act of empathy that enables us to experience someone else's story as truth. As we step into perspectives different from our own, fiction implores us to bear witness to racism, homophobia, fatphobia, xenophobia, and misogyny. It allows us to live in futures that have not yet happened and see the after-effects of climate crisis before they play out.

 # Feds investigate Knox Community Action Committee's Housing and Energy Services program
 Travis Dorman
 Knoxville News Sentinel
 View Comments
 The Knoxville-Knox County Community Action Committee's Housing and Energy Services program, which weatherizes homes for low-income families, is under investigation by federal authorities, the organization's executive director confirmed.
 Longtime director Barbara Kelly said she was contacted Wednesday by the offices of inspectors general of the Tennessee Valley Authority and the U.S. Department of Energy. She spoke to a representative from the Department of Energy, who said officials would be serving a search warrant at the Community Action Committee's headquarters.
 "She just had her authorization, which she showed me, and she told me what she and her team would need to do," Kelly said, adding that authorities were seeking computers and files from the organization's offices at 2247 Western Ave. "They proceeded to do that, and it was very businesslike, very professional, and we cooperated with them."
 Kelly, who's worked at the Community Action Committee for 50 years, said the contact marked the first time she'd heard of the investigation. She said she doesn't know exactly what authorities are examining and didn't want to speculate.
 Created in 1964, the Community Action Committee is a governmental nonprofit agency that uses federal, state and local funds to provide various services to low-income and elderly residents in Knox County. It operates buses, offers nutrition programs, provides assistance filing taxes and more. Lately, Kelly said, the organization has been helping residents whose utility bills have increased during the coronavirus pandemic.
 The organization's Housing and Energy Services program provides emergency home repairs to approved applicants and makes houses more energy efficient by sealing cracks, insulating attics, storm-proofing windows and making other improvements. This weatherization program receives federal Department of Energy funds through the Tennessee Housing Development Agency, Kelly said, and TVA is a partner. Some of the work is done by Community Action Committee employees, and some is contracted.
 The TVA's Office of Inspector General declined to comment Thursday. The Department of Energy's Office of Inspector General did not return messages.
 In a rare move, the FBI confirmed its involvement in the investigation after a TV crew from WATE filmed federal agents walking around at the Community Action Committee's offices on Wednesday.
 Darrell DeBusk, a spokesman for the FBI's Knoxville division, said agents with the FBI and the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation "conducted court-authorized activity at four locations across Tennessee" in partnership with offices of inspectors general from the Tennessee Valley Authority and three federal departments — Energy, Health and Human Services and Housing and Urban Development.
 "Today’s activity is the result of a multi-year investigation," DeBusk said.
 DeBusk wouldn't specify the other locations tied to the investigation and declined to answer further questions.
 Kelly said that, despite the news about the investigation, the Community Action Committee remains open and available to those who rely on its programs.
 "We want people to know that we're cooperating with this, that we're going to continue to cooperate," she said. "No one wants to get to the bottom of this any more than we do here at CAC. We are here to continue to serve and provide the services that people need while we also give this investigation the attention and the seriousness that it deserves."

The basic narrative structure, of the young orphan, the weird kid beaten down by the world, learning and growing and eventually triumphing, worked really well for me. I related to Beth, and especially as the show goes on it was exciting to see her become more capable and self-assured. In the scene with her adoptive father when he reneges on the house arrangement you realize that oh; Beth is approaching it as a chess match. She sees the board, is way ahead of her opponent, and is ruthless about pressing her advantage. The look her lawyer gives her at the end of that scene was great.

“You look at him and say, ‘It wasn’t his time,’” said Jimenez, a florist in East Los Angeles, as her eyes welled with tears.
 The day was all the more wrenching in light of the pandemic’s disproportionate toll on Southern California’s Latino community. In Los Angeles County, officials said this summer that Latinos were about twice as likely to die from the virus as their white peers. The virus has claimed the lives of more than 3,400 Latinos in in L.A. County, many of whom are either essential workers or their family members are.
 Visual artist Consuelo G. Flores, who installed an _ofrenda_ honoring the pandemic’s victims at Self Help Graphics & Art in Boyle Heights, said this year’s celebration is more significant than ever.
 “Where there has not been that opportunity to attend a funeral, to have an end-of-life ceremony, the altar for Day of the Dead becomes the sort of ritual that a lot of people are holding onto and really participating in, so they can have that closure,” she said.

The first challenge Cynzia Sanchez faced when planning last year's Christmas parade in the small Oglethorpe County town of Maxeys was the fact that it didn't have one.
   
 "I was at a community club potluck dinner in September 2019, and I was new in town," recalled Sanchez. "I asked what they traditionally did for Christmas, and was told that they put up a tree at city hall and decorated it. When I suggested having a parade, I realized that I'd pretty much volunteered myself to be in charge of it."
   
 The endeavor had its ups and downs. A chili cook-off kept the crowd of over 100 fed, and Santa made an appearance inside the community center, but a last- minute cancellation from the high school band almost left the parade without music.
   
 "A Kona Ice truck drove up unexpectedly and got in line as we were arranging the floats," said Sanchez. "We only allow small vehicles like tractors, bicycles and four-wheelers, and everyone must apply beforehand. But the truck had a speaker system, so we ended up putting them second in line, right behind the sheriff."
   
 Though Sanchez had a larger planning committee and the previous year's experience at her advantage for 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic presented an entirely new situation, and the first order of business was to decide whether there should be a parade at all.
   
 "We decided that Maxey's needed fun, one way or another," said Sanchez. "Once we agreed that the parade should happen, it became a matter of coming up with ways to do that as safely as possible."
   
 Since all of Oglethorpe County will be invited to participate in this year's event, the community club coordinated with the sheriff's office to close off a one-mile section of Georgia State Route 77 that includes a park and the Firefly Trail, which Sanchez says will provide a large area for socially distanced viewing.
   
 The space between the floats will also be controlled and monitored, and Santa is expected to make an appearance on one of them.
   
 In anticipation of a larger gathering, food trucks from local businesses will be spread out at the community center, and patrons are encouraged to observe the safety requirements for each. Sanchez said attendees are welcome to show up wearing holiday-themed masks, and she hopes to see some with hand-crafted designs.
   
 "Maxeys is an amazing little town," said Sanchez. "The committee members are hardworking and have helped make some things possible that I hadn't even thought of."
   
 The 2nd Annual Maxeys Christmas Parade is scheduled to take place Dec. 5 at 11:00 a.m. Individuals, businesses, choirs, bands and dance companies can email carrieshayes72@yahoo.com to receive a float application form. Interested food vendors can email Sanchez at cynzia260@gmail.com

AVONDALE, Ariz.
 Sheldon Creed gambled on new tires for a two-lap overtime and snatched the Truck Series championship away from teammate Brett Moffitt.
 Moffitt was cruising to his second title in three years when a spin brought out a caution Friday night at Phoenix Raceway. Creed was one of 14 drivers to pit for fresh tires, restarted eighth and figured he'd watch Moffitt win the title for the team.
 But Moffitt was a sitting duck as the leader on four old tires. He was passed immediately on the restart and faded all the way to 10th as the field cruised past.
 Creed dashed to the lead right before taking the white flag and led the final overtime lap for the first Truck Series championship of his career.
 "I pride myself on my restarts. We just needed a good restart right there," Creed said. "I just went as hard as I could. I knew if I did, I'd have a shot."
