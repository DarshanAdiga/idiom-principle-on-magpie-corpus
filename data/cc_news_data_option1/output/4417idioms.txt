Her grievance towards the music industry establishment is most palpable in an undated handwritten essay in which Williams comes at the music critics, the writers who hold court about the merits of musicianship but, from her disdainful viewpoint, know little about the work of instrumental excellence and, particularly in the intimately-connected world of jazz, are in pursuit of their own interests, their own cultural capital. These individuals, these "frustrated never[-]made[-]it critic[s] who once inspired (sic) to be a musician but had no ears so decided to write about it," are the bane of the music itself, since that sort of "burning jealousy" will seemingly ruin the fellowship of jazz which Williams promoted throughout her career. The dream of a critic "who listens to a record broadminded... as if he was playing it," is a praxis that Williams promotes as an alternative approach to

"Buna görə Ermənistan həmişə buna qarşı olub. Səmimi söyləsək, əraziləri azad etdikdən sonra döyüş meydanında gördüklərimiz, orada qurulmuş istehkam qurğuları, - onlar bəlkə də bu qurğulara yüz milyonlarla dollar xərcləyiblər, - göstərir ki, onlar bu ərazilərdən çıxmağı planlaşdırmayıblar. Çünki əgər ərazilərdən çıxmağı planlaşdırsaydılar, bu qədər çox sərmayə yatırmazdılar. Müasir avadanlıq, müasir silahlar, müasir istehkam texnologiyası ilə təchiz olunmuş bir neçə müdafiə səddi var idi. Buna görə danışıqlar masasında onların bütün davranışı vasitəçiləri və bizi aldatmaq cəhdindən ibarət idi. Onlar danışıqları sonsuz edirdilər və vaxt qazanmaq istəyirdilər, onlar 27 il ərzində buna nail ola bildilər. Buna görə, biz əsas prinsiplərə sadiqik. Yeddi rayon bizə qaytarılmalıdır. Ermənilər heç vaxt bu rayonlarda yaşamayıblar. Üstəgəl, Dağlıq Qarabağdan qovulmuş azərbaycanlılar, - müharibədən əvvəl Dağlıq Qarabağda Azərbaycan əsilli 40 min insan var idi, - oraya qayıtmalıdır və plan belə icra olunmalıdır", - Prezident bildirib.

There's another reason some Christians support Trump. They believe the End Times are just around the corner and it's time to start making plans for The Rapture. Just a week ago, Pat Robertson, the televangelist, revealed to his audience that god told him "Donald Trump will be reelected…and his reelection will bring about start of the End Times." These Christians see that as good news. They believe a whole bunch of stuff has to happen before Jesus returns and kicks Evil to the curb. First up, dead true believers will be resurrected, then the living true believers and the resurrected dead will rise up bodily to the clouds to meet god and Jesus. While all this cloud-based business is happening, everything on Earth is going Oh Shit. We're talking war and calamities and all manner of horrible stuff. Then after a period of time, everybody who was raptured away will get to return to Earth like Jesus' sidekicks and destroy Evil. I may have gotten some that wrong, and the chronology might be a tad off. But there are a LOT of different interpretations about what's supposed to happen…but my point, if you can call it that, is that IF you believe somebody like Trump is necessary in order to get to that returning-with-Jesus-to-kick-Evil's-ass moment, then you'd be all 'Yay, Trump!'

So turn back the clock past her veteran days serving as mentor to many. Long before she became the grand dame whose uptown apartment served as the gathering ground for the likes of Duke and Dizz and Monk and numerous others, she was an 18-year-old member of Andy Kirk's swing ensemble, newly married to fellow musician and bandmate John Williams and accustomed, from her years on the TOBA, to the bluespeople itinerancy of a band on the run. With all that under her belt, plus a dose of youthful, north-of-the-Mason Dixon Line naiveté, she stared the perils of Depression-era, apartheid America back in the face with a startling insouciance that put her in danger on multiple occasions. As her biographer Tammy Kernodle describes it, Williams, during her heady early years of touring, was prone "to forget[ting] how blacks were expected to act in the segregated South" — some of which had to have come as the result of her unusual experiences growing up as a musical prodigy first in Atlanta and then Pittsburgh. Gigging with musicians in the fifth and sixth grade ("they'd come to Pittsburgh... come by and pick me up.... I went to all these little cities like Springfield, Ohio... Indianapolis"), drawing crowds on her family's porch that even made fans of the neighborhood police ("I'd play a concert for them. If I was out late at night by myself, coming from a [show], they'd stop and bring me down in a patrol car to the house"), she developed something of a comfort level with risk and a kind of steely practicality undergirded by insistent artistic determination and everyday ambition — all of which came in handy when, for instance, at parties where she played she encountered drunken boys emboldened by "their parents hav[ing] gone to Europe."

But at the end of the day, it comes down to profit and these volumes which were stunning led to adjusted EBITDA hitting $39.2 million Please note that this was a massive beat against $8.1 million consensus. The company saw net income of $12.7 million, compared with a net loss of $9.7 million a year ago. On top of that earnings per share were $0.30, compared with a net loss per share of $0.25 last year. Wow.
 So why be bullish now? Shares have pulled back north of 30% first of all in recent weeks. This was likely due to many students back in school. LRN stock did not get a boost with COVID data, but we think it will now. Looking ahead, K12 sees full-year 2021 revenue in the range of $1.445 billion to $1.470 billion. Adjusted operating income is expected to be solid too. They see it in the range of $120 million to $130 million. We believe that Q2 and Q3 are going to be much better than forecasted. This is because the second wave is just picking up steam. It is spiking big time. We think 2021 EPS could hit over $2.00 this fiscal year. if enrollment volumes spike on the back of this like they did in the preceding months. This is a long way from the losses that analysts saw for Q1 2021.
 What to do? Look, we think that long-term the business normalizes when COVID dies down and people get back to normal life. But it is clear that it is going to be a few more quarters until vaccines are out there and this thing runs its course. With the second wave perking up, let's ride some sentiment higher here.

Instead, Williams' roaming repertoire is the vehicle that carried jazz publics to new temporalities and new, increasingly demanding sites of experimental possibility across the long arc of her career.

Palestinian Arab citizens are also in the spotlight. Israel's four Arab parties are now running together in a Joint List, and polls show their community's low voter turnout could increase. Unlike Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Palestinian citizens of Israel have voting rights in the country and they make up about a fifth of Israel's population, giving them the power to tip the scales against Netanyahu. But they debate whether to even vote at all in a Jewish-majority state they say discriminates against them. Netanyahu has taken aim at Arab voters and lawmakers and is trying to pass a law to allow filming at polling stations against alleged Arab voter fraud. Critics accuse him of voter suppression.

What's important, and what my reporting really revealed, was that it's really essential to look at the background of a person like Deborah Ramirez and indeed anyone who comes into a place like Yale. That has made me sort of newly sensitive to this idea that not everyone comes into college equally equipped to navigate situations like that. She was raised in working-class Shelton, Conn. Her father was a cable splicer. She [had a] strict Catholic upbringing, did things by the book, academically distinguished, not at all experienced sexually or in terms of alcohol, and also somewhat at a disadvantage financially. Her family had to scrape together money for her to get through Yale. In addition to getting loans she worked in the college dining halls, she worked at college reunions cleaning up, she worked at Carvel in the summers. ... She also has Puerto Rican heritage and, as we know now, there is a lot more sensitivity to the experience of people of color. But at the time, there were jokes on campus that she experienced, of people saying "How do you get in here? Is it because you're Puerto Rican?" ... So she already felt kind of behind the eight ball at Yale, had a real deep sense of inadequacy that maybe she didn't belong there and wasn't gonna be able to hack it. So this experience with Kavanaugh only confirmed those insecurities, in a way that was formative.

CNN medical analyst Dr. Jonathan Reiner, a professor at George Washington University told CNN's Don Lemon Friday that the increase in cases was "terrifying" and the worst was yet to come.
 "In a day or two, we'll top, six digits for cases in one day. We will see over 100,000 cases in one day. Now, that by itself sounds bad, but two weeks after that, you know, we'll start seeing 2,000 people a day dying in this country," he said.
 Reiner said the worst-case scenario could be losing 2,000 to 2,500 patients a day but that Americans had the power to contain the virus.
 "We need to mask up and in some places, we need to think about smart closures," he said.
 "Europe is closing all over -- it's the smart thing to do when the virus gets out of control. That's how we got control with the first wave. so, here's the choice for the country: If you don't want to close, then mask up. But we can't have it both ways. We can't be no mask and no closing. So -- if closing is offensive -- let's mask up.
 Another health expert said Friday that testing needs to be stepped up.
 "Today, we now have one person being diagnosed (with the) coronavirus every second," former Baltimore Health Commissioner Dr. Leana Wen said. "We have one American dying of (the) coronavirus every two minutes, and that number is increasing."
 Wen, an emergency medicine physician, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that she is most concerned about the rate of test positivity. In some states, she said one in two people being tested are positive.
 "That means that we're not doing nearly enough testing, and that every person who tests positive is a canary in a coal mine," she said. "There are almost certainly to be many more, dozens of other cases, that we're not detecting, and that escalation is going to increase in the weeks to come."
