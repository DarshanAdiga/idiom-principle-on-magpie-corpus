And it's rise to glory is just getting started. Today, the plant-based meat alternative giant is already worth nearly $12 billion, but new research suggests the market could climb to a whopping $74 billion in just the next few years. From "meatballs" to sausages and 'ham'burgers, Beyond Meat is constantly expanding its product line to appeal to every type of customer, and as this trend of going 'beyond meat' gains traction, the company is likely to reap the benefits. The trend is so big that even industry giants are jumping on board.

ARLINGTON, Texas — If the Dallas Cowboys are going to win without Dak Prescott, Ezekiel Elliott will have to hang on to the ball.
 Elliott lost two fumbles in the same game for the first time in his career and was benched briefly, Andy Dalton threw two interceptions in his first start filling in for the injured Prescott, and the Cowboys never had a chance in a 38-10 loss to Arizona on Monday night.
 While Dalton's interceptions added to the club's NFL-worst turnover margin of minus-12, Elliott's miscues were the biggest because they set up the first two Arizona touchdowns, and handed the Cowboys (2-4) a deficit of at least two touchdowns for the fifth straight game.
 “It’s frustrating to see the pattern here, five of the six games this year,” first-year coach Mike McCarthy said.
 The good news for the Cowboys? They knew going in they would be in first place in the woeful NFC East no matter what happened. So what seemed like a critical three-game homestand when Dallas was 1-2 ended with two more losses, and a jump in the division standings.
 The first Elliott fumble came after the two-time rushing champion took a shovel pass from Dalton as the quarterback was trying to escape pressure. Elliott turned upfield but didn't see Budda Baker, who knocked the ball loose and Jordan Phillips recovered at the Arizona 46.
 After Christian Kirk's 6-yard score on a jet sweep that counted as a pass, Elliott fumbled again two plays later at the Dallas 27. Kenyan Drake's 1-yard run made it 14-0.
 Elliott has five fumbles in six games (four lost), just one shy of his career high for an entire season from two years ago. He had never lost more than two fumbles in a season before this year, and now has four in 2020.
 “I don’t know why,” Elliott said. “I’ve just got to focus up. I’ve got to do better with it.”
 There was more bad news, too. Four-time All-Pro guard Zack Martin left in the first half with a concussion, leaving the Cowboys without four of the five preseason starters on the offensive line for most of their first game without Prescott, the 2016 NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year who was the NFL's runaway passing leader before the injury.
 The two-time rushing champion was benched briefly the next possession, replaced by Tony Pollard before returning in the final few plays of a drive that ended in a punt from the Arizona end.
 Pollard ended up with 10 carries to 12 for Elliott, who had 49 yards. Pollard finished with 31 yards. Elliott did have eight catches, but for just 31 yards.
 “I think they did the right thing and gave some of those reps to (Pollard),” Elliott said. “I have to be a guy this team can lean on, especially in the times right now with so many of our starters not playing. It’s not acceptable. I need to figure it out.”
 The Cowboys have an NFL-high 15 giveaways, and the 84 points they've allowed off turnovers are the most in the NFL through six games since at least 2000.
 “Maybe frankly, maybe we’re trying too hard, or maybe we’re overcoaching it,” McCarthy said. “We’ve been playing uphill every single game. We haven’t gotten into a groove or rhythm and got out in front yet this year.”
 While the offense didn't help a defense that's been struggling all season, that group faded again after its best start. Dallas gave up Kyler Murray's 80-yard touchdown to Kirk, and Drake broke free for a 69-yard run with the game out of hand in the final two minutes.
 The Cowboys have allowed 218 points, the most through six games since the 1961 Raiders gave up 228 as an AFL team. The last NFL team to give up more was Washington in 1954 with 223 points.
 Dalton, who won 70 games in nine years as the starter in Cincinnati before signing a one-year deal to be Prescott's backup when the Bengals drafted Joe Burrow No. 1 overall, was 34 of 54 266 yards with a late, meaningless touchdown.
 “It’s one of those things where I’m always going to be my worst critic,” Dalton said. “Everybody’s got to do that same thing, got to look at ourselves and what can I do to make me a better player to help us win these games and give us a chance.”

But you actually need even more on top of that for the best possible results. See, LRAs are moving parts. That makes them subject to all sorts of other things, like changes in temperature and wear. If this were a math problem on paper with spherical cows in a vacuum and John was carrying eighty identical apples, it would work fine, but reality isn't so forgiving. To mitigate that, Cirrus Logic has a feedback mechanism that takes data from the LRA as it operates, feeding it back into the controller to compensate for age, temperature, and even variety in manufacturing tolerances, all on the fly -- it's called closed-loop control, and we have to assume other solutions like Apple's have something similar. It makes for a more consistent experience over time.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Chase Briscoe earned job security for the first time in his career with a well-deserved promotion to the Cup Series to cap a season that has so far been storybook.
 Briscoe on Tuesday was named the replacement for Clint Bowyer in the No. 14 Ford at Stewart-Haas Racing, the team co-owned by Briscoe's childhood hero. Briscoe idolized fellow Indiana native Tony Stewart and dreamed of one day driving Stewart's car.
 “People would ask me ‘What’s the goal?' and I'd say ‘Man, the dream is to drive the 14,’" Briscoe said in an interview with The Associated Press. “Never in a million years did I think that was possible. Getting to drive Tony's car, and how much of a diehard Tony fan I was, it's just crazy that I'm getting to drive that car.”
 The 25-year-old native of Mitchell, Indiana, is a third generation racer who watched his father compete against Stewart on Midwest dirt tracks. Now he's a nine race winner in the Xfinity Series, the championship points leader, and just the third driver of the No. 14 at SHR since it was created for Stewart in 2009.
 Stewart hand-picked Bowyer to replace him in 2017, and when Bowyer accepted a television deal for next season, it freed the seat SHR desperately needed to avoid losing Briscoe.
 “Chase has worked incredibly hard to make his mark in NASCAR and has earned this promotion,” Stewart said.
 Briscoe said he froze with stage fright during his childhood encounters with Stewart, and was such passionate a fan that he argued every Sunday with his Jeff Gordon-loving grandmother during NASCAR races. He emulated his favorite driver while playing video games, donning Stewart gear and copying Stewart's celebratory mannerisms.
 Much like Stewart, Briscoe is considered a blue-collar racer who lacks the family wealth needed to clear the path for an aspiring young driver. He had to earn everything on the track, yet nearly every year Briscoe's season plans were 11th hour deals.
 He'd slept on couches, worked in race shops and handed out business cards at race tracks trying to catch a break, and was even ready to quit and return to Indiana before a 2016 breakthrough chance in the ARCA Series. So began a series of starts and stops as Briscoe desperately tried to hang on, one sponsorship check at a time.
 Even after he'd locked in on a driver development deal with Ford, his job security depended almost exclusively on funding. A strong three-race close to the 2019 Xfinity season, his first year with SHR, convinced Stewart that Briscoe had strong potential.
 Yet the money was still an issue until a kismet set of circumstances led to a chance meeting on a Las Vegas street between Briscoe's father and the CEO of a technology solutions company who also happened to be a NASCAR fan. Mike Mendiburu passed Kevin Briscoe on the same side the No. 98 adorned Briscoe's hat, catching the eye of the CEO of Highpoint.
 He stopped Kevin Briscoe for a chat, said he rooted for the young driver and, upon learning Mendiburu was talking to Briscoe's father, offered assistance if there was a way Highpoint could help.
 Briscoe was again in dire need of sponsorship. Without it, a second season at SHR was not going to happen.
 But Highpoint, a company that had no involvement in NASCAR and never even considered sponsorship in the sport, pledged the money needed to get Briscoe another Xfinity season.
 The deal was done in January, just weeks before the season began.
 “He decided to go out on a limb, felt like the path of how it all went down, how he met my dad, it was just fate,” Briscoe said. “He took a leap of faith. Mike was even saying last week, if he had just walked out on the other side of the sidewalk, he wouldn't have even seen the hat. So it's just crazy how the details came together.”
 Highpoint's career-saving boost for Briscoe has been rewarded with a spectacular season. Briscoe said from the very start of the year that eight wins would make him worthy of a promotion to Cup. Win No. 9 came last week at Kansas, put Briscoe in the championship race and made for perfect timing to announce his 2021 promotion.
 Highpoint is again stepping up for Briscoe and will move with him to the Cup Series as an anchor sponsor next year on the No. 14. The company is strongly committed to Briscoe and has developed a personal relationship with its new ambassador.
 “Chase has to be one of the most humble and grateful guys in the sport and he has worked incredibly hard for this opportunity," Mendiburu said. “Everyone has seen his talent and he has combined it with incredible humility and an unrelenting work ethic.
 "Simply put, performance without character is not important to us. Chase, however, has both in spades. It’s why he’s ready for the NASCAR Cup Series and why we are so honored to support him.”

Monday was the last day in Pennsylvania to register to vote in the Nov. 3 election in which the presidential battleground state is playing a central role in the contest between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden.
 Voter registration in the state hit a record high in this cycle.
 State elections officials said Monday that voter rolls in Pennsylvania passed 9 million.
 That includes more than 4.2 million Democrats and more than 3.5 million Republicans. Democrats continue to hold a substantial registration edge, but Republicans have narrowed the gap by about 200,000 from 2016′s presidential election to about 700,000 now.

You can't just apply a voltage to an LRA and call it good; it needs a controller to, well, control it, sending precisely tuned signals to the LRA. In the case of Cirrus Logic, its controllers can store specific haptic effects, and smartphone manufacturers can build and add their own, too. (Cirrus Logic also provides software tools to make those, plus other novelties that can synchronize haptics in real-time to things like ringtones, etc.) That means instead of just turning haptic feedback on and off, the controller can send a more complicated set of signals called a "click waveform" to produce a specific effect.

Despite not boasting a top-flight back, New England has remained proficient in the running game. Some of that can be attributed to Newton's elusiveness as a runner -- he's New England's leading rusher with 225 yards, good for just 34th in the league, though. The Patriots are the second-ranked running team with an average of 167.2 yards per game, trailing only the Browns at 169.5. They've also rushed for more yards than they've thrown in three of their five games, including a whopping 250-yard performance in a Week 3 win over the Raiders. Still, look for the 49ers to perhaps take a page out of the Broncos' plan of essentially daring Newton to beat them through the air. Denver limited New England to just 117 yards on the ground.

In a sensewe were designed as a “deterministic chaos” and primed to fail as an economic nation. We have continued to run around in circles because we don’t think much of “thinking”. It was Albert Einstein that said a problem cannot be resolved at the same level of thinking that obtained when it was formed. There are global witnesses who quietly project the number of thoughts that our presidency entertains daily in Aso Rock. The architecture of thought of his advisers are monitored and the sum total of thoughts contributed daily at the Upper and Lower houses in Abuja are equally scrutinised.

The onus is on the government to step up their game and respond with the maturity expected of an adult community. To diffuse the situation and redirect the energies of the youth we need a creative solution.

FALL RIVER - Twenty-three years ago when Todd Salpietro opened TJ's Music at 347 South Main St. he knew being a downtown business owner wouldn't necessarily be easy.
 But the thought of an economically crippling coronavirus pandemic never crept into his imagination.
 Salpietro, like countless other business owners, late last March had to close his music store until Gov. Charlie Baker eventually issued an order allowing many non-essential businesses to reopen with social-distancing measures in place.
 "We were closed two and a half months," he said.
 Last month, Salpietro, 48, got a financial assist in the form of a $5,000 grant courtesy of MassDevelopment's Transformative Development Initiative, or TDI for short.
 The Fall River TDI grant program had offered up to $5,000 to qualifying individual businesses or organizations located within what's called the South Main Street Revitalization District.
 Salpietro say he's used the money to pay bills and the salaries of his five nearly full-time employees.
 "We wanted to continue to work," he explained.
 The quasi-public MassDevelopment, originally known as Massachusetts Development Finance Agency, created the TDI program in 2014 -- as a means of enabling "Gateway cities" like Fall River to stimulate economic development and investment in development projects.
 Gateway cities in Massachusetts are defined as "midsize urban centers" with "stubborn social and economic challenges" as well as "many assets with unrealized potential."
 MassDevelopment said it had a grant pool of $90,000 to cover three rounds of pandemic emergency funding, from April to September, for qualifying candidates who applied for the first round of Fall River TDI grants.
 Of the 28 downtown businesses submitting applications 22 qualified for the grants, according to Jim McKeag, who runs and oversees the Fall River TDI from an office inside the One SouthCoast Chamber of Commerce building on Pocasset Street.
 McKeag says individual grants handed out to qualifying candidates ranged from around $750 to the maximum $5,000.
 Other downtown business grant recipients, McKeag said, included Harry's Restaurant, JavaHouse Chew & Brew and the adjacent Drewbi's Salon.
 He said that One SouthCoast Chamber of Commerce -- with offices in Fall River and New Bedford and a membership encompassing 19 municipalities, including Tiverton and Warren, Rhode Island -- has allowed MassDevelopment, at no cost, to utilize space for the city's TDI program inside the chamber's Fall River building.
 McKeag, 50, also says that the Fall River TDI in recent months has been afforded, at no charge, the use of a storefront space at 333 South Main for what's called the VIVA Fall River Pop-Up.
 That space, located near the corner of South Main and Columbia streets, sits between Facchiano's Shoe Repair and TJ's Music.
 The VIVA Fall River Pop-Up, which took its name from a 1983 song by Portuguese singer and songwriter Jorge Ferreira called "Viva Fall River," is used for occasional meetings of downtown business owners to exchange ideas and strategies to advance business development and revitalization.
 The building is owned by John Varao, owner and operator of the adjacent Tax Consultants Inc. at 435 Columbia St.
 "I'd like them to be successful," Varao, 64, said. "That's what we need downtown, some kind of promotion for local business."
 Fall River native Patti Rego, who does marketing and communications for the nonprofit Marion Institute, says the Fall River TDI has had the support of a number of partners -- among them the city of Fall River, local and regional banks and nonprofit organizations and downtown businesses, including Alexandra's Boutique and Fall River Pawnbrokers.
 McKeag says the city's Redevelopment Authority previously contributed $20,000 to the Fall River TDI grant program.
 Rego, 42, also refers to herself as the "chief city cheerleader and content curator" of We Love Fall River -- which is described as "a social movement showcasing positive stories about economic development, community initiatives and arts and culture" within the city.
 Rego says the VIVA Fall River website "will become the central website devoted to promoting Fall River's small businesses, as well as providing resources to these small businesses in the form of education and connection to consumers."
 The website includes a short video featuring the co-owner of JavaHouse Chew & Brew, who says his sales plummeted 95 percent shortly after COVID-19 became known as a national and international health threat.
 He also describes how TDI, Marion Institute and VIVA Fall River put him in touch with downtown food relief programs, so that he could provide free meals to disabled and senior citizens despite his own financial hardship.
 Rego urges businesses within the South Main Street corridor -- that now stretches from City Hall to Union Street -- to apply for future TDI grants.
 She credits MassDevelopment for what she says was its quick action in response to the pandemic.
 "They showed great alacrity, to keep the lights on and help people," Rego said.
