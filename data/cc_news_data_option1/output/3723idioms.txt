I'm so grateful I made it back in the nick of time. Being with my daughters and my husband during this time has been such a gift. I had been going back and forth between LA and NY every few weeks to see them, so being able to be with them has been truly wonderful. I also have a 93 1/2 year old mom in lockdown, and it's been pretty devastating not to be able to be in the same room with her. I go sing to her outside her window ( I'm sure seeing me climb into the planter outside her window and belting out show tunes is a sight to see) but that brings me great comfort, as well.
