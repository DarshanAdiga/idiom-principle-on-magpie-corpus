 "I never saw him as a rival. He always tried the best for his team, and I tried the best for mine. I always got on well with him. I am sure he will say the same if you ask him.
 "But we know in football, people always look for a rivalry to create more excitement."

Smith and other lawmakers noted that many defense programs can only go into effect if the bill is approved, including military construction. The measure guides Pentagon policy and cements decisions on troop levels, new weapons systems and military readiness, military personnel policy and other military goals.
 Troops should not be “punished” because politicians failed to enact legislation to ensure their pay, said Rep. Mac Thornberry of Texas, the top Republican on the Armed Services panel. The $731-billion measure increases hazardous-duty pay for overseas deployments and other dangerous job assignments, hikes recruiting and retention bonuses and adjusts housing allowances.
 The dispute over social media content — a battle cry of conservatives who say social media giants treat them unfairly — injects an unrelated but complicated issue into a bill that Congress takes pride in having passed without fail for nearly 60 years. It follows Trump’s bid to torpedo the package with an earlier veto threat over Confederate base names.
 Measures approved by the House and Senate would require the Pentagon to rename bases such as Fort Benning and Fort Hood, which are named for Confederate generals. Trump opposes the idea. The fight erupted over the summer amid widespread protests over police killings of Black men and women, and Trump used the debate to try to appeal to white Southern voters nostalgic about the Confederacy.

The legal tussle between the telecom giant, Vodafone and India Inc. tied at deuce with Vodafone’s recent win in a tax liability case at The Hague. In a unanimous decision of the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague ruled in favour of Vodafone on the grounds that India's retrospective demand of Rs. 22,100 crores. as capital gains and withholding tax imposed on Vodafone violated the "fair and equitable treatment” guaranteed under the investment protection pact between India and the Netherlands i.e. the Netherlands-India Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT).      While the tax dispute involving Rs. 12,000 crore in interest and Rs. 7,900 crore in penalties started with Vodafone's acquisition of Indian mobile assets from Hutchison Whampoa in 2007 where-after the Indian government insisted on payment of taxes on the $11 billion acquisition, while Vodafone disputed against it before the Bombay High Court, which ruled in favour of the Department of Income Tax, and subsequently rejected by the Supreme Court, which held that Vodafone was not required to pay any taxes and demanded Income Tax Department to refund Rs. 833 crores in taxes to Vodafone Idea.      However, the convoluted tussle took another turn in 2012. To prevent abuse and plug the loophole of such indirect transfer of Indian assets, the government in 2012 amended the law thus empowering the Income Tax Department to retrospectively tax such deals, as a result of which the onus of paying the taxes fell back on Vodafone which the firm contested through international arbitration.      Thus, the recent setback at The Hague leaves India Inc. with one most obvious option i.e. challenging the award under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 which provides for limited grounds to challenge an arbitral award. A party to a dispute, if dissatisfied, has the right to challenge the award and in light of the persuasive effect it is likely to have on other treaty arbitrations which concern retrospective tax measures, such challenge is justified. The government should consider damage mitigation strategies after losing against Vodafone in the backdrop of similar, but separate lawsuits such as the Cairn Energy tax dispute.      On the flipside, as the Permanent Court of Arbitration situated in The Hague had passed the award in favour of Vodafone, there lies no further authority for putting up appeal. The government can only go back to the Permanent Court of Arbitration on some technical point, but that will not serve any purpose. Furthermore, the Indian Arbitration Act obliges the government to implement a foreign tribunal award, Vodafone can ask for the same in case the award is challenged in Indian courts. However, in the present scenario, since all the property, both tangible and intangible of Vodafone, lies outside India it will be difficult for the government to successfully challenge it in Indian Courts due to jurisdictional issues.      Alternatively, India Inc. may choose to gulp in the award passed in favour of Vodafone and do nothing. However, still waters on the legal front may have a ripple effect among investors. At the outset, the legal wrangle may appear to have no additional negative impact on investor sentiment as they recognise that challenge proceedings are part of the norm, appealing against an international arbitration award may disincentivize investors in the long term. Reason being, a change of legislation against the spirit of the Supreme Court judgment on the subject by resorting to retrospective legislation, certainly creates an unpredictable and unstable business environment. From an international investor’s perspective, investment in countries leading to change in legislation when companies get entangled in legal tussles with governments for non-compliance with international orders jeopardizes investor interests and hurls them in an abyss of losses.      Besides discouraging investors, it creates interruptions in the ease of doing business in such countries and thus disincentivizes them to make any investments or indulge in any form of funding. Vodafone’s victory at The Hague may accord partial relief in the backdrop of its mounting AGR dues owed to India Inc. However, it is likely to have implications on other international arbitration cases over retrospective tax claims and cancellation of contracts. If other companies like Cairn Energy and a dozen others were to follow suit, the Government of India could end up paying burning a hole in its treasury for damages if it loses. It is debatable whether the fault lies in the tax laws and the amendments made thereof, however the after effects will have to be borne by the entire economy regardless.

Panels are also required to have a “Dead Front,” which is an area of the panel “without live parts exposed to a person on the operating side of the equipment.” All live components must be covered in this way so that anyone using the circuit breaker is safe from electric shock, as per electricity board rules and regulations.

 LONDON, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Sterling rose against a broadly weak dollar on Wednesday after three days of losses as British Prime Minister Boris Johnson headed to Brussels for dinner with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in a last ditch attempt to avoid a no-deal Brexit.
 With only days to the end of the Brexit transition period, traders are hopeful that a face-to-face meeting between UK and European Union leaders can break the deadlock.
 In a week marked with high volatility, the British currency fell to a near three-week low on Monday as leaders failed to resolve their differences in the broader trade talks, raising concerns of a no-deal Brexit.
 But Tuesday offered a glimmer of hope when Britain said it would drop clauses in draft domestic legislation that breach the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement after reaching an "agreement in principle" with the EU over a sticky negotiating point.
 The British currency rose 0.5% against the dollar on Wednesday in volatile trading at $1.3433 in early London trading, heading towards a 2-1/2 year high of above $1.35 hit last Friday.
 Against the euro, sterling was 0.4% higher at 90.27 pence, after falling to a seven-week low on Monday.
 But in a sign that the latest markets moves were more of an indicator of panicky trading, overnight implied volatility gauges -- a measure of expected price swings -- rose to close to 25%, touching the highest point since late March.
 "The jump in implied volatility does suggest there has been a fall in confidence regarding the prospects for a deal," said Jane Foley, head of FX strategy at Rabobank.
 "That said, after the recent selling pressure on the pound, some speculators are clearly viewing PM Johnson's trip to Brussels in a positive light and are reducing short positions," she added.
 Ahead of the meeting in Brussels, one of PM Johnson's most senior Brexit- supporting ministers, Michael Gove, told BBC radio on Wednesday that Britain sees scope for a compromise on some of the sticky negotiating points.
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the EU and Britain could still reach an agreement on a Brexit trade deal but added that she could not guarantee there would be a breakthrough at an EU summit on Thursday.
 "The 'now or never' moment is here," said ING analysts in a note to clients. "The meeting will tell us a lot". (Editing by William Maclean)

 Dec 9 (Reuters) - European shares hit February highs on Wednesday, joining a global rally on optimism around progress in COVID-19 vaccines and U.S. stimulus package, while all eyes turned to make-or-break Brexit talks.
 The pan-European STOXX 600 index and London's FTSE 100 both climbed 0.5%. Germany's DAX jumped as much as 1.3% to a three-month peak.
 Data showed German exports rose less than expected in October, but foreign trade still gave Europe's largest economy a boost at the start of the fourth quarter as it struggles to avoid slipping into a double-dip contraction.
 Meanwhile, UK Brexit supremo, Michael Gove, sounded hopeful of a compromise on fishing in Brexit trade talks, but others including EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier and UK PM Boris Johnson, said a no-deal scenario was more likely.
 Johnson is to meet European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen at Brussels for dinner on Wednesday in a last ditch attempt to seal a deal.
 "It will be a coin toss, there is a lot of symbolism," said Teeuwe Mevissen, senior market economist at Rabobank in Amsterdam.
 "But our base-case scenario is still that we will see a very skinny deal before the end of this year," he said, adding that Wednesday's optimism was more from progress on a U.S. stimulus package after the Trump's administration proposed a $916 billion coronavirus relief package.
 Meanwhile, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Pfizer and made further progress with COVID-19 vaccine trials and regulatory approvals, respectively.
 The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq hit record highs overnight, and Asia shares followed suit.
 Gain in Europe were led by value stocks with autos, banks and oil stocks rising more than 1%.
 The tech sector was in the red, dragged down by a 11.7% slide in chipmaker STMicroelectronics after it postponed its $12 billion annual sales target by a year to 2023.
 Among individual stocks, Signify NV, slid 6% after the world's largest lighting company said it expects revenue to drop 13-13.5% this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Shares of planemaker Airbus rose 1.2%. Britain said it would suspend retaliatory tariffs from Jan. 1 imposed on U.S. goods as part of a dispute over aircraft subsidies.
 The multi-billion dollar tariff battle relates to a row over state subsidies for aircraft manufacturers Airbus and Boeing .
 Greek stocks rose 1.5% and were on course for their 14th straight day of gains, their longest winning streak ever.

SPOKANE, Wash. (KXLY) - Two young children escaped from an apartment fire in Washington by jumping from a third-story window. Neighbors were there to catch them and help them to safety.Trevor Main heard a bloodcurdling scream Tuesday morning and ran over to the Regal Ridge Apartments, where he saw a young boy hanging from a third-story apartment window with black smoke coming from behind him.“It kept going and going, and then, your hairs kind of stand up,” Main said.Another witness says a little girl jumped out the window first, but the boy didn’t. So, Main broke down the door, prepared to risk his life to save the child.“He looked like he didn’t want to jump out of that window because that’s scary, so if you can get in through the apartment and get him out that way, you have to try,” Main said.When Main couldn’t get through the smoke, he and other neighbors finally convinced the boy to jump from the window and helped catch him as he fell.“He bumped his face on the rocks pretty good, but as long as he’s OK, that’s all we cared about,” Main said.The boy was taken to the hospital and is expected to be OK.The children’s mother was also home at the time of the fire. Main says she told him the Christmas tree sparked the blaze. Firefighters have not confirmed the cause.Three cats were killed in the fire, and the family’s apartment was destroyed. Many others were damaged.Main says he’s just thankful everyone is OK.Copyright 2020 KXLY via CNN Newsource. All rights reserved.

The announcement came after new infections rose by 4,262 on Tuesday to a total of 354,568 since the beginning of the pandemic. The death toll rose on Tuesday to a total of 5,527. But the rate of deaths and infections is not evenly spread around Switzerland – the French-speaking region has things under greater control than German-speaking cantons.
 This has been attributed to some cantons enforcing their own mini-lockdowns, which they are now starting to ease as the number of infections in their regions falls.
 Speaking to Swiss public broadcaster RTS, Geneva State Councillor Mauro Poggia could not disguise his frustration at his region facing the same restrictions as worse-hit cantons. “It's disrespectful towards the French-speaking cantons,” he said.
 His comments were echoed by Fribourg economic minister Olivier Curty. “The trend in French-speaking cantons is to reduce measures,” he said. “For the Confederation to introduce much more restrictive measures into a consultation is a problem for us and a big concern.”

Pamela Anderson has written to the Taoiseach to urge him to ban hare coursing in Ireland.
 The former Baywatch actor said coursing, which involves hares being chased by greyhounds, was “cruel and reckless” and was at odds with the “warmth and goodwill” that the country was known for.
 Hare coursing is already banned in Northern Ireland and in Great Britain.
 Coursing events were recently suspended in Ireland due to Covid restrictions.
 Anderson, who said the suspension should be permanent, has written to Micheal Martin as part of her role with animal rights organisation Peta (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals).
 It is not the first time the Canadian born star, who is the honorary US director of Peta, has reached out to a taoiseach on animal welfare issues.
 In the past, Anderson urged Enda Kenny to ban wild animal circuses and called on Leo Varadkar to prohibit fur farming.
 The Government has since banned wild animal circuses and has committed to phasing out fur farming.
 In her latest letter, the actor wrote: “As a long time animal rights advocate, I’ve celebrated alongside my friends at Peta after writing to your predecessors and hearing that Ireland had banned wild-animal circuses and would be moving toward ending fur farming.
 “But there’s still more to be done. Will you please be the Taoiseach who finally lays cruel hare coursing to rest?
 “The novel coronavirus has taught us the devastating consequences of messing with wildlife. And your government can heed that lesson by banning this so- called ‘sport’, in which gentle, sensitive hares – wild animals – are torn from their natural homes so that they can be chased by hounds for someone’s twisted idea of amusement.
 “Hare coursing is reckless – and it’s cruel. Many hares die when they are captured, transported, and held captive before meets. Some endure stress- induced heart attacks or other organ damage, or they collapse and die of sheer exhaustion while desperately fleeing from the dogs.
 “This blood sport is at odds with the warmth and goodwill that people around the world know and love Ireland for. The practice is currently banned because of lockdown restrictions, and you can help ensure that it’s not allowed to resume. It’s time – past time – that Ireland consigned hare coursing to the history books, where it belongs.”
 In September, Rise TD Paul Murphy tabled a private members’ bill in the Dail in a bid to ban hare coursing.
 Previous attempts to change the law have failed.

Wright also recently performed his hit “PTSD” with Chance the Rapper on the “Tonight Show” with Jimmy Fallon.
 According to the indictment, the scheme centered on the defendants’ use of stolen credit card information and personal identities obtained either from the “dark web” or other sources.
 The defendants then texted or used social media to share the stolen information on the fly, at times even as merchants were in the process of charging the goods or services. They referred to the stolen information in coded messages as “cards,” “moves” or “joints,” according to the charges.
 In November 2017, Strong, using the name “Darren Geiger” and identifying himself as Wright’s manager, called an unidentified pet company in Michigan to order “two designer puppies” for Wright using a stolen credit card, according to the charges.

 SINGAPORE/TOKYO, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Money surging into Asia has equities in India and South Korea at record highs and the region's currencies on the cusp of their best ever quarter, signalling a shift in capital flows that investors say is set to lift Asian asset prices even higher.
 At $17.5 billion, foreign buying of Asian stocks was the heaviest in a dozen years last month and the wall of cash that streamed into regional bond markets totalled $15.2 billion.
 Money managers expect the rising tide has a long way to run as investors rush back into the region, attracted by low valuations, high yields in some markets and signs that most economies are rebounding.
 Net equity outflows still amount to $34.1 billion so far in 2020 after pandemic-induced selling early in the year, and net bond inflows outside China are only $1 billion, suggesting plenty of dry powder can be put to work.
 "It won't happen in a clear smooth line and there will be volatility," said Nader Naeimi, head of dynamic markets at AMP Capital.
 "But some fast money seems to be getting interested again," he added, referring in particular to flows into Thailand, where foreigners bought $1.1 billion in equities in November and the stock market had its best month in 17 years.
 India and South Korea have been other favoured destinations, and benchmark indexes there have scaled record peaks, lifting the S&amp;P BSE Sensex by 78% and the Kospi by 91% from March lows.
 "We see an opportunity to rotate away from China," said Andrew Gillan, head of Asia ex-Japan equities at Janus Henderson Investors in Singapore, who is bullish on Seoul-listed chip makers and banks in less-loved markets in Southeast Asia.
 "We like China, but from an asset allocation perspective, it is less likely that China will outperform in the next 12 months simply because, in the 20 years I've been investing, this is the strongest five years for China relative to the region."
 Prashant Bhayani, Asia chief investment officer at BNP Paribas Wealth Management, said Singapore and Indonesia are attractive thanks to exposure to cyclical and value stocks.
 STICKY FINGERS
 Equity and bond flows have also driven large shifts in currency markets, sending Asian currencies to multi-year highs, illustrating the depth of money moving into the region.
 MSCI's Asia ex-Japan currency index is up a record 4% this quarter at all-time high and it is on track for an annual gain of 6% - double the rise in the emerging markets' currency index.
 To be sure, the hardest hit markets remain below pre-pandemic levels, and others feel overdue for a pullback, with recent gains extremely vulnerable to outright reversal, as March's experience made clear.
 "There's no such thing as sticky money for Indonesia, let's be clear about that," said SooChong Lim, head of Asia corporate research, at J.P. Morgan in Hong Kong.
 "(But) this fund flow is very different...now the global tap is flowing and Indonesia stacks up quite well," he said. "For Indonesia, the best barometer on the sentiment is the rupiah."
 The currency is up more than 5% since October and is near a five-month high as investors have dived in to the bond market, driving 10-year sovereign debt yields down by some 70 basis points but still well above 6%.
