Con gli stessi obiettivi, conditi con riferimenti a QAnon, contro Soros ma pro Trump e Vox, è attivissimo su Twitter con l’account paseamosjuntos il movimento Resistencia Nacional de España, ex Movimento Barrio de Salamanca, ispiratore delle prime caceroladas e organizzatore delle manifestazioni no- mask estive. Si presenta come come un movimento sganciato da ideologie e aperto a tutti, tranne i comunisti. Una degli autoproclamati leader del movimento però, Maria Luisa Fernandez, ha pubblicato in passato video xenofobi e sul suo canale Youtube definisce Vox il partito più trasparente di tutti, il partito del futuro e dei patrioti. Vicini a Resistencia nacional e coorganizzatori di molte manifestazioni no mask i medici negazionisti di “Medigos por la Verdad”: tra loro omeopati, insegnanti di yoga, sostenitori della medicina alternativa, che si sono già ramificati anche in America Latina, mescolandosi a movimenti prolife e antiabortisti.

Jammu and Kashmir's Covid-19 tally is likely to cross the one lakh mark on Wednesday but the government remains optimistic and says the numbers are not "worrying".
 The first Covid-19 case in the union territory was detected nine months ago in Jammu in March.
 A senior government official said that when data will be released Wednesday evening the Covid-19 tally would cross the one lakh mark.
 "Yesterday evening the total cases were a few hundred short of one lakh and today the number will be crossed. We have been getting more than 300 cases every day," he said.
 The union territory's Commissioner Secretary (Health), Atul Duloo said that J&K's Covid-19 tally now stands at 99,844 which is 8,139 cases per million and recovery rate is 93.03 per cent.
 "Our mortality rate is 1.55 per cent and positive rate is 3.9 per cent," he said.
 So far J&K has conducted 2,06,227 tests per million population which is more than double the national average that stands at 98,786. Till Tuesday night there were 5,415 active patients in the UT. The doubling rate of positive cases in Jammu and Kashmir in the last seven days stood at 130.1 which is less than the national average of 142.6 days.
 Dr Qazi Haroon Qazi Haroon, officer on special duty for Covid mitigation in Kashmir said that J&K is placed better as the graph of positive patients is declining.
 "We were expecting a bit of hue and cry due to the fact that normal seasonal flu will add to our miseries and will be labeled as Covid but so far things are well under control."
 Dr Shafkat Khan, health expert and Jammu and Kashmir's former nodal officer for Covid-19 said that the recovery rate and the people tested for Covid in the union territory seem far better than other states.
 "It is however, difficult to predict whether there is a next wave in the offing. The Government seems to have come a long way in augmenting the infrastructure and required logistics and is geared up for any such eventuality. It now entirely depends upon the precautions to be taken up by the people to prevent the further spread of the virus till a vaccine comes up."
 However, many doctors say the number of positive patients could be more as dozens of patients are getting treatment at home.
 "I know many people who receive treatment at home for Covid-19 as they don't want to go to hospitals and Covid centres. Yes the situation is better than what it was four to five months ago. Today we know many things about the disease which helps us in treating the patients either in hospitals or at home," said a senior consultant who is treating Covid patients on a daily basis.

In 2000, Mexican business magnate Carlos Slim (who was ranked as the world's richest man in 2010 and 2013), had an expensive lesson on the importance of research in business. He failed to adequately research before acquiring CompUSA for $800 million. But at the time, desktop computers were being rapidly replaced by laptop computers and other emerging technologies. The result? CompUSA value plummeted and closed down in 2007, after costing him an estimated $2 billion.

ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — A Turkish fishing boat capsized on Wednesday after colliding with a Greek-flagged tanker off Turkey’s Mediterranean coast, officials said. Four people on board the boat were killed while one other person is reported missing. The incident between the Polatbey fishing boat and the Greek-flagged Ephesus occurred at dawn, about 15 nautical miles off the coast of Karatas, in Adana province, the Turkish coast guard said. A search- and-rescue operation involving three coast guard boats and a team of divers was launched shortly after communications with the boat was lost. The coast guards later recovered four bodies and was still searching for a fifth person, the Adana governor's office said in a statement. The cause of the incident wasn't immediately known.

In the first step to regulate digital content, the government has expanded the powers of the information and broadcasting ministry to start regulating over the top, or OTT platforms such as Netflix, Amazon Prime videos and Hotstar and other digital content including online news.The change is part of a comprehensive exercise at the I&B ministry to enact a new law that would decriminalise offences under the 1867-vintage Press and Registration of Books Act and make it mandatory for news websites to get themselves registered with the Registrar of Newspapers of India (RNI). The proposed law is to be placed before the Union Cabinet soon.The presidential order amending the powers of the information and broadcasting ministry was issued on Monday, weeks after a public interest litigation was filed in the Supreme Court that sought directions to the Centre to set up a mechanism to monitor, manage and regulate content on video streaming platforms. The order brought films and audio-visual programmes made available by online content providers and news and current affairs content on online platforms under the purview of the I&B ministry.People familiar with the matter told Hindustan Times that the order is the outcome of an exercise that had been started in the government some time back and isn't directly linked to the petition before the Supreme Court."Prime Minister Narendra Modi had ordered for the change in the I&B ministry's powers on May 30," a senior government functionary said.He said the government had been receiving complaints about unregulated, sexually-explicit, vulgar and legally restricted content being put out by the OTT platforms and others. "But there was no mechanism to redress the grievances that people had," the functionary said.The ministry of electronics and information technology, or Meity, the only department of the government that could have any jurisdiction over the digital media, is not equipped to monitor content but only the technical aspects.The information and broadcasting ministry is likely to require these platforms to enlist with the ministry to be able to operate in the country. This would imply that even international on-demand streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Videos would be required to register with the government and follow the ground rules for the videos that they stream, an official of the information and broadcasting ministry said. This would bring the treatment of foreign players on par with domestic players such as MX Player, Voot, Altbalaji, ZEE5, Sun NXT and Eros.Parallelly, the government has also finalised the draft Registration of Press and Periodicals (RPP) Bill that has been in the works for years. In its refurbished format, the proposed law would make it mandatory for news websites and online channels to register with the government.Officials said there was a need for a mechanism to ensure that digital content did not cross the widely- accepted redlines. While there is a Press Council of India headed by a retired judge to hear complaints relating to the print media, television news channels come under News Broadcasters Association (NBA).The changes, seen as an effort to level the field between the traditional media and the digital media space, also simplify the registration procedures. For instance, news websites and newspapers would not need to file a separate request to the district magistrate but only apply online to the Press Registrar General, which shall seek the feedback from the district magistrate concerned, before approving the request.

The Delhi High Court Wednesday pulled up the AAP government for relaxing norms for public movement and gatherings in the national capital even as Covid-19 cases were increasing and questioned whether it has any policy or strategy in place to deal with the "alarming" situation.A bench of Justices Hima Kohli and Subramanium Prasad said that when Delhi, as city state, was "hands down beating" Maharashtra and Kerala in the number of daily new cases in the past two weeks, what concrete steps have been taken by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government to contain the spread of infection.The court noted that the daily number of new Covid-19 cases received for November 10 was at 8,593 and "still counting" and the number of containment zones in the city were 4,016.The court further noted that as per the latest sero survey report of the government the antibodies presence was detected in 25 per cent of the persons tested which meant that one in four persons has been infected by Covid-19."No household has been left untouched," the bench said, referring to the survey data and questioned as to why the Delhi government was relaxing norms in such a situation when other similarly placed states were bringing in restrictions.The court questioned the rationale behind allowing 200 people to attend public functions instead of reducing the number and permitting public transportation to be fully occupied, saying that these could turn into "super spreaders" of the infection.The court also sought to know as to why the Delhi government, represented by additional standing counsel Satyakam, has not come out with any legislation to ensure strict adherence to wearing of masks which was being termed as a "vaccine" till the actual vaccine comes.It directed the Delhi government to file a status report explaining steps taken by it in the last two weeks, when the Covid-19 cases have risen alarmingly, to contain the spread of the infection and listed the matter for further hearing on November 19.

In his 147th first-class match and in his 275th innings, Ferguson was lbw to Mark Steketee for 97 as the Redbacks resisted – but lost – at Glenelg on Wednesday. Steketee’s big inswinger might have been a tad high and might have been missing leg, but there were no histrionics from Ferguson, who left with a smile, striding through a gauntlet of fist taps from generous Queensland opponents. “I can’t thank the Queensland blokes enough, led by Usman (Khawaja),” Ferguson said after play. “To honour me with a guard of honour when I walked to the crease and then another guard of honour at the end of the game, well, that was unnecessary but really appreciated.” Falling three shy of a 21st first-class hundred was unfortunately apt given Ferguson’s luck has often been out, such as when he was dumped after a sole Test in 2016. But his final day in whites – he’ll continue in 50 and 20 over cricket – wasn’t without honour, as during his innings he passed Les Favell to move into fourth place on SA’s runs list. Unfortunately, the Redbacks, like Ferguson and his hundred, fell just short of saving the game, defying the Bulls for 158 overs only to be bowled out for 385 late in the day to lose by 62 runs. “I am enormously proud of this playing group,” Ferguson said after SA almost saved another game with a marathon second innings. “Every time we’ve had to bat 150-plus overs in the second innings we’ve fought and taken it right down to the wire.” Ferguson and Harry Nielsen added 218 runs for the fourth wicket to give the Redbacks faint hope of running down the 447 set by Queensland. When Nielsen fell, also lbw to Steketee, for 113, the customary Redbacks collapse appeared a formality. But Liam Scott and Chadd Sayers batted with a ton of guts to add 68 in 28 overs to deny the Bulls. Scott was bowled shouldering arms to Steketee for 28 (110 balls), leaving only the Redbacks bowlers standing in the way of a Queensland win. It looked like they’d pull it off until Sayers’s 122-ball vigil ended on 46. Mitchell Swepson spun out the tail to deliver a thrilling win with only minutes remaining in the last session.

 Each year, Veterans Day offers Americans the opportunity to come together and recognize those who have valiantly served. These great patriots are our men and women in uniform who, for generations, have had the courage to rise to the occasion in pursuit of a better, safer life for their fellow countrymen.
 Our veterans are tenacious - they have seen and experienced things that most of us can only imagine. They are patriots - their love of country is unmatched, and their willingness to sacrifice their lives in order to defend our nation is inspiring.
 And yet despite their many accomplishments while in uniform, they continue to live out their lives with remarkable humility and grace which is common among members of our United States military.
 Our veterans are heroes, and our nation is grateful for their sacrifices.
 Honoring our heroes is a responsibility that our community does not take lightly. Ridgecrest does an incredible job of commemorating our veterans through local, annual Veterans Day events to honor them and their stories of bravery. And though things may look different this year, our community continues to feel a deep admiration for our nation's heroes, and I am grateful that Ridgecrest makes the important effort to ensure that their legacies will always be remembered.
 Sharing the stories of our heroes is one way we can honor our nation's veterans, but so is working to emulate our men and women in uniform each day by embodying the values that they fought to protect, like democracy and freedom. It is my hope that this Veterans Day, we are all able to honor our veterans by seeing our nation through their eyes: something to be fiercely protected and something worth fighting for. Our veterans teach us what it means to be an American, and I hope that you will join me in striving to follow their lead.

BOSTON — Patients who have dental insurance through the state's Medicaid program are often faced with a difficult choice when they have a tooth that's badly decayed: They can pay out of pocket for a costly root canal, or have the tooth removed.
 Budget cuts in the midst of a recession forced Beacon Hill leaders in 2010 to roll back adult coverage for most reconstructive dental procedures through MassHealth. Since then, its dental coverage has been mostly limited to routine cleanings and tooth extractions.
 But lawmakers are proposing to reinstate coverage for root canals, crowns and other services as part of the latest version of the state budget.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi will on Thursday co-chair a virtual summit between India and 10-nation Asean that is expected to focus on measures to recover from the economic turmoil triggered by the coronavirus pandemic and ways to further broadbase the strategic ties.
 The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said the summit will review the status of Asean-India strategic partnership and take stock of progress made in key areas such as connectivity, maritime cooperation, trade and commerce, education and capacity building.
 The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) is considered one of the most influential groupings in the region, and India and several other countries including the US, China, Japan and Australia are its dialogue partners.
 The summit is taking place amid China's aggressive behaviour in the disputed South China Sea as well as in eastern Ladakh. A number of Asean countries have territorial disputes with China in the South China Sea.
 Along with Modi, the 17th India-Asean summit will also be co-chaired by Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc.
 "The leaders will discuss ways to further strengthen Asean-India engagement and in this context will note the adoption of Asean-India Plan of Action (2021-2025). Covid-19, post-pandemic economic recovery and important regional and international developments will also be discussed at the summit," the MEA said in a statement.
 The 10 member countries of Asean are Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Brunei, Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar and Cambodia.
 Prime Minister Modi attended the 16th Asean-India Summit in Bangkok in November last year.
 "Asean-India strategic partnership stands on a strong foundation of shared geographical, historical and civilisational ties. India's Act East Policy, underlining Asean centrality, reflects the importance, India attaches to engagement with Asean," the MEA said.

China indicated that it wants Australia to act to improve strained relations, saying Canberra should know what needs to be done to get ties back on track.
 "China has been pragmatic in growing its business relations with all partners. A healthy relationship needs the nurturing and care of both sides," Assistant Minister of Commerce Li Chenggang said Wednesday at a press conference in Beijing. "Australia should know more clearly than China what it needs to do to improve this relationship."
 Ties between the two nations have worsened rapidly this year after Australia called for an investigation into the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic in China. Beijing, meanwhile, has placed tariffs on Australian barley imports, banned some other imports and ordered traders to stop buying at least seven commodities including coal, copper and wine -- actions which Australian ministers have labeled "economic coercion."
 China Turns to Lobsters, Wine and Coal to 'Punish' Australia
 Li's comments were similar to a statement last week from China's Foreign Ministry, which also urged Australia to act first.
 "Mutual respect is the basis and prerequisite for state-to-state cooperation," ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said then. "Once again we urge some in Australia to reflect upon their deeds, do more things that are conducive to mutual trust, cooperation and the China-Australia comprehensive strategic partnership, and create favourable conditions and atmosphere for bilateral practical cooperation across the board."

 The Australian government needs to calm down and see the huge potential of China's market, according to a former senior Commerce Ministry official.
 To improve ties, "first of all, Australia has to stop making irresponsible remarks," Wei Jianguo, a former vice commerce minister, said Wednesday. "Second, you have to import Chinese products based on WTO principles, especially 5G and digital products, rather than using security grounds at will."
 "Third, and I think this is very important, we should strengthen mutual trust," he said, adding that the situation would worsen if things weren't corrected. Wei denied that any ban had placed placed on imports from Australia, calling this "rumors by Australian media."
 Australian Trade Minister Simon Birmingham declined to comment to Bloomberg about Li's remarks.
 In an interview Monday with Sky News, Birmingham said the government was still unable to make contact with China at a ministerial level -- a stalemate that has been in place since Australia called for independent investigators to be allowed into Wuhan to probe the origins of the pandemic.
 "There are problems, and there are deeply troubling and concerning aspects, to some elements of that trade relationship at present," Birmingham told Sky News. "So we are continuing to closely monitor that and trying to work out all diplomatic and government-to-government levels that we can to secure a better understanding and resolution of some of those concerns."
 Ties between the key trading partners have grown increasingly strained in recent years, with Canberra barring Huawei Technologies Co. from building its 5G network, and amid accusations of Chinese interference in Australia's internal politics. Beijing's retaliatory moves come as Australia -- whose economy is the most dependent in the world on China -- tries to pull out of its first recession in almost three decades.
 The Chinese pressure came from many sides, with an editorial Tuesday in the state-backed China Daily also calling on the Australian government to resolve contentious issues.
 "Australia should see clearly the bright prospect of the bilateral cooperation and meet China halfway to push the bilateral relationship back on track at an early date," China Daily said.
 Earlier this week, in an interview with an Australian newspaper, a researcher at a Chinese government-connected think tank said Prime Minister Scott Morrison's government needed to act to improve ties.
 Researcher Mei Xinyu, who works at a think tank under China's Commerce Ministry, suggested Australia should offer to send government ministers to China and should express interest in Beijing's new five-year economic plan.

In the first step to regulate digital content, the government has expanded the powers of the information and broadcasting ministry to start regulating over the top, or OTT platforms such as Netflix, Amazon Prime videos and Hotstar and other digital content including online news.
 The change is part of a comprehensive exercise at the I&B ministry to enact a new law that would decriminalise offences under the 1867-vintage Press and Registration of Books Act and make it mandatory for news websites to get themselves registered with the Registrar of Newspapers of India (RNI). The proposed law is to be placed before the Union Cabinet soon.
 The presidential order amending the powers of the information and broadcasting ministry was issued on Monday, weeks after a public interest litigation was filed in the Supreme Court that sought directions to the Centre to set up a mechanism to monitor, manage and regulate content on video streaming platforms. The order brought films and audio-visual programmes made available by online content providers and news and current affairs content on online platforms under the purview of the I&B ministry.
 People familiar with the matter told Hindustan Times that the order is the outcome of an exercise that had been started in the government some time back and isn't directly linked to the petition before the Supreme Court.
 "Prime Minister Narendra Modi had ordered for the change in the I&B ministry's powers on May 30," a senior government functionary said.
 He said the government had been receiving complaints about unregulated, sexually-explicit, vulgar and legally restricted content being put out by the OTT platforms and others. "But there was no mechanism to redress the grievances that people had," the functionary said.
 The ministry of electronics and information technology, or Meity, the only department of the government that could have any jurisdiction over the digital media, is not equipped to monitor content but only the technical aspects.
 The information and broadcasting ministry is likely to require these platforms to enlist with the ministry to be able to operate in the country. This would imply that even international on-demand streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Videos would be required to register with the government and follow the ground rules for the videos that they stream, an official of the information and broadcasting ministry said. This would bring the treatment of foreign players on par with domestic players such as MX Player, Voot, Altbalaji, ZEE5, Sun NXT and Eros.
 Parallelly, the government has also finalised the draft Registration of Press and Periodicals (RPP) Bill that has been in the works for years. In its refurbished format, the proposed law would make it mandatory for news websites and online channels to register with the government.
 Officials said there was a need for a mechanism to ensure that digital content did not cross the widely-accepted redlines. While there is a Press Council of India headed by a retired judge to hear complaints relating to the print media, television news channels come under News Broadcasters Association (NBA).
 The changes, seen as an effort to level the field between the traditional media and the digital media space, also simplify the registration procedures. For instance, news websites and newspapers would not need to file a separate request to the district magistrate but only apply online to the Press Registrar General, which shall seek the feedback from the district magistrate concerned, before approving the request.

The Delhi High Court Wednesday pulled up the AAP government for relaxing norms for public movement and gatherings in the national capital even as Covid-19 cases were increasing and questioned whether it has any policy or strategy in place to deal with the "alarming" situation.
 A bench of Justices Hima Kohli and Subramanium Prasad said that when Delhi, as city state, was "hands down beating" Maharashtra and Kerala in the number of daily new cases in the past two weeks, what concrete steps have been taken by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government to contain the spread of infection.
 The court noted that the daily number of new Covid-19 cases received for November 10 was at 8,593 and "still counting" and the number of containment zones in the city were 4,016.
 The court further noted that as per the latest sero survey report of the government the antibodies presence was detected in 25 per cent of the persons tested which meant that one in four persons has been infected by Covid-19.
   
   
 "No household has been left untouched," the bench said, referring to the survey data and questioned as to why the Delhi government was relaxing norms in such a situation when other similarly placed states were bringing in restrictions.
 The court questioned the rationale behind allowing 200 people to attend public functions instead of reducing the number and permitting public transportation to be fully occupied, saying that these could turn into "super spreaders" of the infection.
 The court also sought to know as to why the Delhi government, represented by additional standing counsel Satyakam, has not come out with any legislation to ensure strict adherence to wearing of masks which was being termed as a "vaccine" till the actual vaccine comes.
 It directed the Delhi government to file a status report explaining steps taken by it in the last two weeks, when the Covid-19 cases have risen alarmingly, to contain the spread of the infection and listed the matter for further hearing on November 19.

The Nation's Weather for Wednesday, November 11, 2020 _____ NATIONAL SUMMARY A surge of tropical moisture ahead of an advancing push of cooler air will trigger areas of drenching rain and locally gusty thunderstorms from the upper Gulf Coast to much of the Appalachians and Eastern Seaboard today. The rain can be heavy enough to lead to localized flooding and travel delays.
