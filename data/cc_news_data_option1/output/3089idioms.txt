The Wild routinely walk by the Canucks on their way to eat.


  "It’s definitely different. You’re in an absolute war with a team, and then you ride the elevator with them,” Canucks defenseman Tyler Myers said on Wednesday.


  Game 3 is on Thursday The Canucks are banged up, with four forwards iffy. Tyler Toffoli and Adam Gaudette were hurt in Game 1 and held out of Game 2. Michael Ferland and Antoine Roussel left Game 2 with injuries.


  The Canucks will likely go as far as their talented top-six group of forwards will take them, with the "Lotto Line” of J.T. Miller, Elias Pettersson and Brock Boeser making a significant impact so far.


  Pettersson has impressed the Canucks with his tenacity, too, the frequent target of not-so-friendly hits from the Wild.


  "I’m always impressed with his skill level, and I’ve been anxiously waiting to see how he does with this type of hockey, and it’s been impressive so far,” Canucks coach Travis Green said.


  The Toronto Maple Leafs will play the rest of their qualifying round series against the Columbus Blue Jackets without defenseman Jake Muzzin, who returned on Wednesday to the team hotel after his discharge from a hospital. He was hurt in a scary on-ice collision late in their 3-0 win in Game 2 on home ice at Scotiabank Arena.


  Muzzin took a crosscheck and fell chest-first onto the legs of Blue Jackets forward Oliver Bjorkstrand behind the Toronto goal and was down for more than 10 minutes on his back before being taken off on a stretcher. Muzzin was alert and able to move all of his limbs.


  "He’s a mentally strong guy, a big tough kid, so we’re just hoping for a speedy recovery,” said teammate Kyle Clifford.


  Martin Marincin practiced in a pairing with Tyson Barrie on Wednesday, on track to crack Toronto's top six on the blue line with Muzzin out.


  Columbus is 0-for-6 on the power play through two games.


  Another young team that has not won a postseason series in five years, the Calgary Flames have the Winnipeg Jets on the ropes with the chance to advance with a late-night win in Edmonton.


  Calgary has scored 12 goals over the first three games of the qualifying round series, with two apiece from Mikael Backlund, Johnny Gaudreau and Elias Lindholm. The focus for Game 4 will be to "kill the will" of Winnipeg, said defenseman Derek Ryan. The Flames beat the Jets 6-2 in Game 3.


  "It's something we can put in the bank for ourselves as a young hockey club trying to find its way come playoff time and draw some confidence from it," Flames coach Geoff Ward said, "but also draw a little bit of comfort knowing that we're able to put a game like that on the ice when we need to.”

The unusual plan was to cut his wife's income for a while so the couple's annual earnings were low enough to be eligible for a quota system in new property developments designed to give more low-income newlyweds access to housing.


  Even so, Baek and his wife decided to settle west of his Seoul workplace in Incheon, where borrowing rules were looser and apartments far cheaper.


  "Seoul home prices grew way out of reach, we had to go all the way to Incheon to buy our place," Baek said. "The government is crushing our dreams when they curb loans and tell us not to buy homes, it enrages me."


  Despite more than 20 cooling policies introduced by President Moon Jae-in’s government, home prices in Seoul have risen more than 50 percent since 2017, the fastest pace in the world, according to statistics site Numbeo.


  The surge has dashed the hopes of many young families and signaled that the "middle class contract" that helped build Asia’s fourth-largest economy may have slipped out of reach.


  When the left-leaning Moon took office in 2017, his central promise was to create a level playing field for all South Koreans and a society where hardworking people could raise a family and afford a home.


  But tighter mortgage rules featuring vastly lower loan-to-value ratios, along with various tax penalties to discourage speculative transactions, are contributing to higher rents and larger down payment requirements — hurting those the policies are intended to help.


  Mortgage rules for Seoul now cap borrowing at 40 percent of the value of the home. Pockets of the glitzy Gangnam area are also subject to a transaction permit system, meaning sales without a permit can be made invalid if a purchase is considered "speculative."


  Critics say such policies mean the "gold spoon" children of the wealthy can snap up the best homes with their cash, leaving "dirt spoons" trapped as second-class citizens — fueling the inequality Moon promised to tackle.


  While some families are cutting their incomes to improve their chances of getting a boost onto the property ladder, others are getting divorced on paper to reduce real estate taxes or not registering their marriage to keep separate home-buying applications, according to two lawyers and a tax accountant Reuters spoke to.


  Anger at Moon's economic policies has wiped out a surge in his approval ratings from the handling of the coronavirus pandemic, slipping back to a near nine-month low of 44.5 percent, according to a Real Meter survey on Thursday.


  The Presidential Blue House declined to comment for this article.


  On Tuesday, Finance Minister Hong Nam-ki said stabilizing home prices was the government's biggest public welfare policy goal as plans were announced to add more than 132,000 new homes in Seoul through 2028.


  For decades following the 1950-53 Korean War, South Koreans saw a degree from a top university and an apartment in Seoul as the fastest way to the middle class, which explains why about three-quarters of household wealth is concentrated in real estate.


  But now, "dirt spoons" who studied hard and secured white-collar jobs such as lawyers and interior designers say the cooling measures Moon introduced have made it impossible for them to buy a property in Seoul even with a six-figure salary.


  It now takes an average Korean household more than 14 years of income to buy an average Seoul home, assuming zero expenses. It was 11 years when Moon took office, KB Bank data shows.


  Hong Na-ri, a lawyer who rents a three-bedroom apartment with her twin daughters and husband in Seoul, says her family is priced out of the property market.


  The price of the flat Hong has been renting in Seoul's Songpa neighborhood has more than doubled to 1.8 billion won since she moved to the area in 2015.


  "When I got married (in 2015) I believed prices will go down … now everyone asks me why didn't buy one when I could. It makes me anxious, but there is nothing I can do," said the 35-year-old, whose combined household income ranges from $6,700-$10,000 a month.


  "It's not like I can move outside of Seoul, away from our babysitter, preschool, and my job."


  Moon is trying to fix structural problems in the economy.


  He has sought to rein in the powerful conglomerates such as Samsung and Hyundai, which have seen their profits far outstrip household income growth. Tighter mortgage rules were introduced because the easier credit available under his predecessor was blamed for initially stoking the housing bubble.


  Yun Chang-hyun, a conservative economist and member of parliament for the opposition United Future Party, says the government's approach is creating more uncertainty about future.


  "More than 20 separate sets of measures without success has caused stress and anxiety among people they must buy something now or never."

 The National Education Policy 2020 has revived an old debate on medium of instruction, especially in primary schools: What role should English have in our education system?
 But like all ex-colonies, this question is unlikely to go away anytime soon.
 It is worth noting though, that there are actually very few public proponents of English as the medium of instruction for primary school children. The only exceptions are perhaps some Dalit public intellectuals. In contrast, there are many individuals and organisations that speak for and demand vernacular, officially recognised state languages or mother tongues, to be recognised as the medium of instruction at the primary school level. This is especially so in schools supported or run by state governments.
 In this situation with so many mother tongue lovers and supporters, it is as though there is the ghost of the English language that mysteriously works its powers and succeeds in not just becoming the language of instruction in high and low income private schools and institutes of learning, but also the language of power and privilege against which the majority of the communities in India have to perpetually fight.

Most recently open-concept layouts and hot desks have become commonplace in many corporate offices.

Sadly, several episodes that could have been great, don't quite stick the landing. _In The Flesh_ sees the crew encounter a reconstruction of Starfleet Academy in the Delta Quadrant, part of a secret invasion plan by Species 8472; like the Borg, their impact is certainly lessened here. _11:59_ tries to explore Janeway's ancestor in 2001, but ends up a somewhat dull _Hallmark_ movie. Even the finale _Equinox,_ which sees the crew encounter another stranded Starfleet vessel, isn't quite as impactful as it should be. The idea of the Equinox being a dark mirror to Voyager is a fascinating concept, but while some of the performances and the _Year of Hell_ -esque set pieces are intriguing, it doesn't end the season with the bang that it should have had. Captain Ransom should be the dark reflection of Janeway, but she herself has shown herself to make some fairly ruthless, questionable decisions, making her self righteousness here just a little less palatable.<br

  “I think unfortunately it was like a second preseason,” Rowe said of the training, then two weeks of matches in Florida. “We had to get minutes quickly, play in a very hostile environment, in the sense of the heat and the humidity.


  “It was a little bit awkward to have every team in the same hotel and you’re passing each other every day. It’s one of those things that we got through it. The positives were that we created a lot of chances and we didn’t give up many chances. Can we put things away and kind of tighten things up? Of course. That’s what we’re here to work on.”


  Rowe is addressing the scheme of midfield play, orchestrating New England’s forward motion with Gustavo Bou, Carles Gil and Adam Buksa.


  “I got used to that role a little bit of being that ball winner in the middle,” Rowe added. “It’s not something I’m used to. In my past years, I’ve obviously played everywhere, but more of an attacking player than anything else, and this time was a little different.


  “I think I got a little more comfortable with my role. Players around me got more comfortable with what I was able to do. I think I gained a lot of fitness as well.”

Two-parter _Dark Frontier_ is far less successful, but manages to pit Seven against the Borg Queen, while Janeway fights for her in a maternal battle of wills, _Think Tank_ sees Seven become the subject of a genius organisation for her skills and abilities, the charming _Someone to Watch Over Me_ has Seven explore the possibilities of love, while _Relativity_ sees her recruited into a time travel mission to Voyager's maiden voyage.<br

COLDWATER -- Fire Chief Dave Schmaltz promised to take Coldwater to a unique level for a small community to achieve an ISO 2 insurance rating.


   


  Less than two years after taking the job, it has come to fruition. After the fire department's 2020 Insurance Service Office review, the department has improved its score from Class 3 to Class 2.


   


  As Class 2, it will result in potentially lower fire insurance premiums for property owners of Coldwater.


   


  Based upon ISO's 2020 information, only 17 out of 1,442 rated communities in Michigan have received a Class 2 fire rating. Nationwide, only 5% of the rated communities received a Class 2 or lower score. Coldwater now counts itself among the communities in the top 5% for fire safety.


   


  The change reflects local investment, a proven and reliable predictor of future fire losses.


   


  The community's grade is based on three categories. The fire department equipment, staffing and operation makes up 50% of the score, while the water system is 40% and finally, the 911 center is 10. ISO has evaluated and classified more than 39,000 fire protection areas across the U.S. and rated them from Class 1 to Class 10.


   


  "Achieving a PPC score of 2 in a community the size of Coldwater is a difficult task, to say the least," said Schmaltz. "It takes a lot of attention to detail and the commitment from the elected officials to provide the needed resources. Without the support of the city council, city administration, the water department and the total commitment of the entire staff at the fire department, none of this would be possible. They all should be extremely proud of what we have achieved."


   


  Because of this, insurance companies use a community's ISO score to help establish premiums for homeowners and commercial fire insurance. In general, the cost of fire insurance in a city with a lower score is substantially lower than one with a higher score.


   


  The new rating takes effect in November. Schmaltz is encouraging everyone to contact their insurance carrier to let them know of the rating change.

 The news follows a series of major job losses in recent weeks and months as businesses take stock of the damage caused by the coronavirus crisis.

 Mr Gaze said: "Blowtorch heat is coming from the Sahara, with around a 10 per cent chance of over 37.8C. Computer models show 36C or 37C highs, but often understate extreme high temperatures, as they did by several degrees when last Friday reached 37.8C."

See here for more on that Morning Consult poll, and here for the Politico story. The DSCC has backed Hegar for months, so it's good to see them stick with her. I don't know a thing about this poll - this tweet from Hegar shows the first paragraph of the email she got about it - but as I've said before, the big thing to me is that Cornyn is more or less running even with Trump; he's been ahead of Trump in a couple of polls, and behind him in some others, but usually within a point or two. If that remains the case, and if Biden wins Texas or comes close enough, that may be all that Hegar needs. Raising her name ID, mostly to prevent lower-information voters from wandering over to a third-party candidate, will help with that.
