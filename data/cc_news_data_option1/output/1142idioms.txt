In that first season, it is clear she has a history with Jimmy and that her residual fondness for him is tempered by serial disappointments. She isn't just a girlfriend character -- she seems more like an ex-girlfriend who had stayed in touch but is, for the time being, holding Jimmy at arm's length. Her focus is on her career. Despite his natural talents (easy patter, common touch, extraordinary intelligence and ability to improvise) Jimmy is a distraction, something upon which she could run aground. He is her kryptonite.

Don’t give me 300 lines of praise from other authors and then throw in a list of awards and accolades on the cover. I really don’t care what John Green thinks; I just want to know what the book is about. These days, I have to go on a treasure hunt to find the mini blurb — if that exists at all — about the actual content of the book. Is it on the front-flap, hidden somewhere in the introduction, or is it buried somewhere else? I’d ask Mr. Green, but he’d probably get lost in the maze too.

The sound of us upping anchor for a final time brings with it a sudden panic. My month at sea has left me institutionalised: once I disembark who’ll cook my lunch, pick the film, tell me when and where to be? Most of all, though, I fear I’ve taken my time soaking up the Antarctic’s splendour for granted. Did I make the most of it? What will I do when I look through a window and all this magnificence just isn’t there? I suppose those last ones are probably questions we all have to grapple with. Unless there’s a radical shift in how we interact with our precious planet, there might well come a day when we look up and it’ll have disappeared for good.

The English Premier League is tentatively targeting a resumption on June 1 with a view to completing the season over six weeks before making an August start to the 2020-21 campaign, the Sunday Telegraph reported on Sunday.
 The report said the sketchy plan was a "best-case scenario" aimed at mitigating the heavy losses clubs are sustaining as they continue to pay wages while football remains shut down because of the coronavirus pandemic.
 On March 13, all elite level soccer matches in England, including the Premier League, were suspended until April 4 with that stoppage subsequently extended until April 30.
 The postponement of the Euro 2020 championship for a year, however, has cleared space in the calendar for domestic competitions to finish if the public health situation allows.
 Player contracts, some of which end in June, could be an issue although world governing body FIFA has said it is looking into possible 'dispensations'.
 Under the plan being considered, the Telegraph said, the Premier League and FA Cup competitions would be resumed with matches played behind closed doors.
 The 2020-21 campaign would get underway after a short break on Aug. 8, the report said, allowing the league to fulfil its commitments in the second season of three-year broadcast deals worth 9.2 billion pounds ($10.73 billion).

Earlier that day, Greenpeace had published a report that was three years in the making; it set out the harm transhipping can do, both to the oceans and the fishermen on board.

Myoelectric control of limbs, serving to replace amputated parts with prostheses, involves a lot of issues that must be solved. It starts from the detection of the electrical activity of muscles on the stump, which though does not develop a useful muscular exertion, can be used to control at will some predefined motions of the artificial hand. An essential problem to be solved in this approach is the acquisition of the most useful controlling biosignals for the prosthesis, but the more important issue is to extract the control information from the raw myosignals.

But I also want them to survive the economic ash heap that is going to be left after our leaders are done flattening the curve. The economic devastation could be far more lasting than COVID itself.
 There is medical health and there is economic health. Without economic health first, we cannot achieve the medical health we desire. We won’t be able to afford it. Thus, the old saying, wealth equals health. It’s why people in poor countries have such miserable life spans.
 The Centers for Disease Control, the World Health Organization, and other health organizations are entrusted to view the world through medical health eyes, not economic eyes, and God bless them for it. They are doing their jobs and we all should be grateful.
 The CDC types are paid to have a purely engineering mind-set. Flatten the curve. Flatten the curve at all costs. To them market realities are an obstacle to overcome, a limitation to push through to a medically healthy outcome. Their expertise is health, not the economics to pay for it.
 Think of it this way. The best metal conductor for electricity is gold. If engineers were allowed, unchecked by market reality, they’d build every power transmission line out of gold. It makes the most sense from an engineering point of view. Of course, it is impossible to run golden electrical lines from power plants to your home because it is economically insane.
 Shutting down private businesses by government fiat is economically insane, not to mention bordering on martial law.
 It will certainly flatten the curve of COVID-19, a very worthy goal, but in the long run it could be a curing a sickness via suicide. A person struck by the virus can and likely will survive. Small businesses, especially in hospitality, likely won’t. And the families that depend upon them might not either.
 Sadly, government has monopoly control over K-12 education and therefore can shutter our schools. Wrongly, government owns what should be private entertainment venues, sport arenas and the like and can close them down. And maybe it’s wise to do so.

It seems like our whole world has been canceled in the past week. Coronavirus has changed our daily lives from school cancelations to large events being postponed or canceled. Yes, the word “canceled” is all over the place, but we’re (rightly so) more concerned about making sure we all stay safe and healthy. As we all adjust to a radically different world than the one we lived in a week ago, I’m going to focus for a minute on British and American English spellings. By doing so, we can know the correct way to spell “canceled” in the U.S.
 Why are so many British and American English words spelled differently? Look no further than the All-American boy Noah Webster, Jr. In addition to being buddies with Alexander Hamilton, serving in the Connecticut House of Representatives, and being a fascinating character, Webster was a lexicographer, which is a fancy way of saying “word nerd.” In 1806 he published his first dictionary, called A Compendious Dictionary of the English Language.
 Much of Webster’s influence came from his spelling reform. While spelling reform doesn’t sound all that revolutionary, I appreciate Webster’s American view of questioning the way things had always been done. Although he introduced many ideas of different and simplified ways to spell words, Webster gets credit for “defense” (instead of “defence”), “color” (instead of “colour”), and “plow” (instead of “plough”). His 1828 An American Dictionary of the English Language was Webster’s first comprehensive dictionary. It established many of the spelling differences between British and American English, although many other simplifications (like “tung” instead of “tongue” and “soop” instead of “soup”) didn’t catch on.
 Mr. Webster’s spelling proposals aimed to weed out pointless letters, making words easier to spell. This included slashing an “L” from words with double “L’s,” including “canceled,” “traveled,” “counselor,” “jewelry,” and “equaled.” Webster’s influence led to new standard American spellings, as the double “L” words are still standard British spellings. Lately, I’ve seen quite a few events being “cancelled,” while the users should be using the one “L” version, “canceled.”

Gene G. Skanes Born in Benton Harbor, Michigan, September 7, 1931 Gene G. Skanes was the third son to Arletta and George Skanes. He graduated from Lincoln High School in 1949 alongside his fraternal twin brother Jack. To meet him, you would have thought he had stepped out of a movie: Tall, athletic, handsome, and proud, Gene was not afraid to challenge a bad idea or action. He was the strong patriarch who did what needed to be done, even facing death with dignity and grace. If you knew him, you would know that Gene worked at the lumber mill for 37 years as a lumber stacker and was the IIWA Union Business Agent for 8 years. A firm advocate for equality, he also spent many years sitting on boards and canvassing for political candidates whose ideas have helped shape the progress we enjoy today. If you knew him, you would also know that his two greatest personal accomplishments were marrying Luann Fouke and having close relationships with his children, grandchildren and extended family. Gene and Luann spent many weekends and vacations traveling long distances, regardless of cost, to support their family. Together they embodied the ideas of "unconditional support" and "undying love". This incredible man was renowned for his crazy, wicked wit, huge sense of fun, amazing (almost uncanny) cribbage and fishing skills, storytelling and cooking. But it was his kindness, generosity, wisdom and unwavering love that were his most outstanding qualities. We are thankful that there are many name sakes that will carry on his warrior spirit. He died March 14, 2020 with his loving family around him. He is survived by his wife, children, grandchildren, great grandchildren, brother, nieces and nephews.

It’s how, Greenpeace argues, illegal and unregulated fish are laundered into the market, which is estimated to be worth between $10bn and $23.5bn annually. (“Dodgy fish” is mixed together in freezers with more sustainable, better regulated catch.) Human rights abuses at sea – including poor working conditions and modern slavery – are well documented, and by transhipping, beyond scrutiny and national jurisdiction, such malpractice is too often out of sight and out of mind. There are three transhipment boats (known as reefers) currently in the South Orkneys, I’m told. Using complex satellite mapping and ship-tracking software, Cooke and her team have identified one of them – a cargo vessel they suspect has dodgy fish on board.

That means tens of millions of people will recover at home or never even know they’ve been infected.

As social distancing and other pandemic-related compromises begin to take their toll on our social, emotional, and physical well-being, it’s important to take time to consider the things we _can_ still do. Hiking, as far as I can tell, is definitely one of those things. What better way to clear your mind and get some fresh air, while continuing to adhere to pandemic minimizing guidelines, than to take a stroll in the woods? However, due to the strenuous nature of trekking through the wilderness, many hikes aren’t necessarily an activity accessible to all, or even most, people. For this reason, I thought it might be a good idea to review one of the more attainable hikes that I’m aware of: the Burke Mountain Powerline Ridge hike.

 Career dream on hold
 Gia Vacek’s printed graduation announcements arrived in the mail Wednesday ­— the first day of mainly staying indoors.
 What should have given her joy added insult to injury, and not just because of the misspelling. Vacek, of Santa Rosa, was on course to graduate magna cum laude from the Culinary Institute of America in New York, not “maxima” cum laude, as it said on the invite.
 As things stand now, her graduation is on hold. Nearing the end of a required semester at the Institute’s St. Helena campus, Vacek and her classmates were attending a luncheon the week before, celebrating the imminent completion of their coursework. That’s when they all got the same email on their phones: those courses had been canceled.
 It’s not clear when she’ll be able to finish her degree. Nor is it clear when she can begin pursuing her career ambition to “go to the East Coast and get a job in a bakery.”
 “That dream’s on hold for a year or two,” she surmised.
 Why so long? She figures it could take that long for the economy to come back, for businesses to start hiring, “and for people to start going out to eat again.”
 A Maria Carrillo High School graduate, Vacek turned 22 on Tuesday. It was during her modest birthday party that shelter-in-place announcement arrived. Those restrictions kicked in the next day, the same day her invitations came in the mail.
 Typo or not, she’s tempted to hang on to them. When her graduation does, finally arrive, “I’ll just scratch out the date” ­— right now it says May 7, 2020 — and write in the correct one, even though she has no idea when that might be.
 Undaunted artist
 The cascade of cancellations began on Monday for Sonoma artist Jennifer La Pierre, a flood of bad news in her in-box wiping out an entire spring season of shows and exhibitions in one day.
 There was little time for self-pity. There were her two daughters to soothe. La Pierre’s youngest, Lena Temko, 17, was crushed. All of her upcoming swim meets were canceled, a bitter disappointment after all those hours of training. The teen had an entry in the Sonoma Valley Film Festival that she and her friends had been working on for three months. Canceled. And what about prom? Oldest daughter Elise Temko, a junior at Sonoma State University, was home for spring break and wondering what next, with all classes going online.

We have a hotline so if someone has a need, we will help if we can,” Fuller said.

She loved teaching school as she inspired and touched lives of many children. She also loved antiques, Doo-Wop and anything related to "Gone with the Wind". With an undergraduate work in music, she was known to have a life-time yearning to play keyboard for either Bruce Springstein or Bob Seger.
 In February 2018 she was named a West Virginia History Hero for her outstanding work and significant contributions to the preservation of West Virginia History. She was most proud of that award. Her greatest love was Red Rock where she was a co-owner of the farm belonging to her great -great grandmother, Joanah Robinson. Elma enjoyed being a direct, straight shooter. She wanted to leave "no doubt" where one stood with her. She lived by the philosophy, "I Did It My Way".
 She was a member of the Christ United Methodist Church, the Maryland Retired School Personnel Association, the Rowlesburg Revitalization Committee, the Rowlesburg Historical Society, the Red Hat Society and a trustee of the Red Rock Cemetery Association.

A día de hoy son nuestros héroes. Solo quiero mostrar mi admiración y agradecimiento\", apuntó.

There’s on-board wifi keeping me connected to civilisation, although how it works remains a mystery. (It involves, I’m told, a complicated satellite system.) Just a few years ago, being at the end of the world meant losing touch completely. If, say, a panic-inducing medical epidemic happened to sweep the world, you wouldn’t hear about it. I’m grateful I can Skype my family, but while being online is convenient, a part of me was hoping for a little more isolation. I wanted to switch off and experience time spent truly off-grid. Instead, I’m scrolling through Instagram, responding to work emails as if I’m sitting at my London desk. But then, one particularly bumpy afternoon, I drop my iPhone when a big wave hits, and the screen smashes to pieces, so I surrender myself completely to my life at sea.

The closure, as of now, would be effective till April 13, 2020.
 Whether the work can be resumed on April 14, 2020, or this phase would need to be extended would be decided by the Graphite Cova group management, Germany, on or before April 13, 2020, the company said in its notification.
 The subsidiary is into manufacturing graphite electrodes, graphite and carbon products and speciality products. For the year ended March 31, 2019, Graphite Cova GmbH reported turnover of ₹1,260 crore and profits of ₹558 crore, as per information available in the company’s latest annual report.

Travaglio ha toccato il fondo. In questo momento così duro per l’Italia con ormai oltre 5000 morti da piangere, lui che fa? Un attacco politico alla Lombardia (in quanto governata dalla Lega, al fine di screditare la stessa). L’ho detto e ripetuto molte volte: non sono un fan di Salvini e sono distante anni luce dal suo pensiero, ma speculare (da ambo le parti sia chiaro) su una tragedia come questa è veramente da inetti. E mai e poi mai avrei creduto che Travaglio si abbassasse a tanto. Se non altro per rispetto a tutti quei medici e infermieri che si stanno facendo un mazzo tanto mentre lui dallo studio di casa sua scrive inopportunamente. Forse avrà ragione, forse no. Ma non è questo il tempo dell’accusa (se di accusa si può parlare) ma solo il tempo del silenzio e della pietà

Gerrard replaced Lallana and, as he ran on, Jordan Henderson attempted to have a word. However, it appeared to fall on deaf ears, with the Scouser focused on the task ahead. He flew into a tackle with Mata, sending the Spaniard flying into the air. But the pumped-up Gerrard was not done there, and when Ander Herrera lunged in to steal possession, his opponent lifted the ball over him with his right foot and then stamped on the United player’s right shin with his left. Gerrard waved his arms in disgust as Herrera rolled on the floor clutching his leg, but referee Martin Atkinson was not fooled and immediately produced a red card. Gerrard briefly feigned surprise but did not argue. Just 38 seconds of the second half had elapsed. Mata went on to score again, and although Daniel Sturridge pulled one back, Liverpool – playing better with 10 men – lost 2-1.
