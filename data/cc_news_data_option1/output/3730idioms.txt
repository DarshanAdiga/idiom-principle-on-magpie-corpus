During the first stage of reopening next month, charter flights will be limited to three flights a week with a maximum of 100 passengers on board each plane, presumably to observe some form of physical distancing. Even allowing for increased capacity in a later phase, the entire plan will do nothing to rebound the moribund tourist industry in Thai resorts.

On Wednesday, Bailey, along with a who’s-who list of people involved with the United States biathlon program and staff from the college, were on hand to see the first shots fired as the new biathlon range was christened at Paul Smith’s.
 Although there’s more work to be done at the range, it’s now the centerpiece of a Nordic facility that’s combined with an extensive new trail system that connects to existing trails at the college’s Visitor Interpretive Center.
 Three student-athletes who are members of the college’s new sports initiative program had the honors of taking the first shots. Lina Miner-Fara, Dolcie Tanguay and Garrett Beckrich are American biathletes all pursuing Olympic dreams, and at the same time working toward degrees as scholarship student- athletes in the college’s first-year program that allows them to continue training in the sport while attending school.
 The new range is impressive, with eight shooting stations and the potential for expansion. What’s even more amazing is the fact that ground was just broken on the massive venue a year ago.
 “This is an amazing place,” Bailey told the audience gathered at the unveiling of the range. “It’s always been a great place. It’s always been a place with great terrain, good skiing, always good snow, and now seemingly out of a miracle, there’s been a world-class biathlon venue just dropped into the middle of it. I can’t say enough about the hard work that everyone has put in.”
 Tim Burke, who now lives in Lake Placid and who like Bailey, grew up in the Adirondacks and is a four-time Olympic U.S. biathlete, is one of the coaches for the three new Bobcats. He was also on hand for the ceremonial shots fired. And along with Bailey and Burke — the two most successful biathletes in U.S. history — Max Cobb, the president and CEO of the US Biathlon Association, was also in attendance.
 Others at the gathering included Paul Smith’s head Nordic ski coach Matt Dougherty, the new interim president of the college Jon Strauss, and Lake Placid’s John Morgan, the sports initiative director at Paul Smith’s. John Morton, who played the lead role in designing all the new trails in the woods surrounding the range, was also present.
 “I grew up just 2 miles down the road from here, and to be here standing in a biathlon range right next to where I grew up is truly incredible,” Burke said. “So much has happened so fast here at Paul Smith’s. When Max and I started talking with the college just last year about starting a program here at Paul Smith’s for biathlon, we were always excited about it. When we left the first conversation, we thought ‘Hey, this is great, but this is something that’s maybe a couple years to get rolling.’
 “What the college has done in such a short amount of time is truly incredible,” Burke continued. “Not only have we started this program, we’ve improved on the trails, we’ve built a biathlon venue, and we’re so excited to get started with our first three students already this year.”

Mohammad Hafeez, Misbah, and Azhar accompanied PCB chairman Ehsan Mani and CEO Waseem Khan met PM Khan on Wednesday.
 The cricketers insisted that the cricketer-turned-politician reconsider the decision to abolish departmental cricket for the sake of players and officials who lost their jobs.
 Sources said that this did not go down well with the Board and it decided to issue show-cause notices to Azhar, a centrally contracted player, and Misbah, a contracted coach. Hafeez is unlikely to face any issue because he is not a contracted player, said the sources.
 It must be noted here that PM Khan rejected their demand. “I tried to explain to Misbah, Hafeez, and Azhar that the best players emerge when there is competitiveness. Australia is the most successful team in the world cricket and produces the best cricketers just because of the system,” PM Khan said during a ceremony in which the PCB signed the broadcast agreement for matches to be played in Pakistan.
 Meanwhile, there are unconfirmed reports that Azhar is going to be removed from captaincy. The right-handed batsman had replaced wicketkeeper-batsman Sarfraz Ahmed in 2019. He came under fire for his leadership skills during the three-match Test series in England recently.
 Since he took the reins in the longest format, Pakistan have played eight matches and won only two, losing three and drawing three.

A property just north of Tysons that has been owned by a local family for several generations now will be turned into a three-home subdivision.
 The Fairfax County Board of Supervisors on Sept. 15 unanimously approved plans by the applicant, Margaret F. Ahbe Trustee, to create the new subdivision on 1.71 acres at 8801 Jarrett Valley Drive.
 The site now is occupied by a home built in 1940. The developer will subdivide the property into lots for three single-family detached homes, plus a 35,520-square-foot outlot that will have open space, two bioretention stormwater facilities, passive recreation facilities, a walking trail, tree- save areas and a noise wall.
 The site, 47 percent of which will remain open space, will have one access point from Jarrett Valley Drive and the home will be arrayed along a “pipestem” driveway configuration.
 Each home would have a maximum footprint of 3,500 square feet and a three-car garage, plus parking courts.
 Part of the site is located within 200 feet of the Dulles Airport Access Road. The developer will build a sound wall between 4 and 10 feet tall along the property’s eastern and southern boundaries to block noise from that highway and Leesburg Pike.

Still, Biden added, “I have my own deal,” which he noted the Democratic Party has incorporated as part of its platform.
 Biden also weighed in on foreign policy issues, promising to reduce America’s military footprint abroad and saying that any attempt to interfere with the election by a foreign power is a “violation of our sovereignty.” He promised that if he’s elected and it becomes clear post-election that Russia interfered in the election, “they’ll pay a price for it, and it’ll be an economic price.”
 Biden described Russia as an “opponent,” but declined to use the same word when asked about China. He instead called the nation a “competitor” and pledging to improve trade policy with China.
 Trump signaled he’d been watching the town hall before he took the stage for a rally in Misonee, Wisconsin, on Thursday night.
 “I just see he’s up there tonight getting softball questions from Anderson Cooper. They don’t ask me questions like that,” Trump told the crowd gathered at the airport. “They’ve got cars ... it’s the weirdest thing I’ve ever seen.”
 Trump’s ABC town hall was held inside a half-empty auditorium, with attendees socially distanced and wearing masks.
 The format of Biden’s event was a stark reminder of the issue that’s been a central focus of Biden’s campaign — that the pandemic rages on, affecting Americans’ lives in ways large and small, and that stronger leadership in White House could have eased the crisis. More than 195,000 Americans have died of the coronavirus — by far the highest death toll in the world.
 Earlier in the day, Biden joined Senate Democrats for a conference call lunch and told allies that he is taking nothing for granted in the race for the White House and the down-ballot effort to wrest the Senate’s majority control from Republicans. He fielded questions, particularly from senators facing reelection, about his strategy win back the chamber and defeat Trump.
 “He just said, ‘You know what we’re up against. You know why this is so important,’” said Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich.
 West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin said he encouraged Biden to remind workers how much he has been on their side during his many years in government.
 “I’ve said, ‘Joe, people need to know that you recognize the dignity of the work, the people have built this country,’” Manchin told reporters. “They need to know that you fought for their pensions, you fought for their health care ... and you’re not gonna leave them behind.”
 Biden’s campaign team has come under scrutiny in recent days over its outreach efforts, particularly for what some see as short shrift with Latino voters. At the same time, Democrats have mixed views over the party’s get-out-the-vote effort that largely bypasses traditional door-knocking to avoid health risks during the pandemic, instead relying on virtual outreach.

In approaching the fall semester, we knew that being on campus provided the best support for our students, many of whom are the first in their family to attend college. We also know that students are more likely to stay in college with this support, graduate, and make a difference in the life they choose.
 The students I have met on campus this past month have told me how happy they are to be back in Plattsburgh. They understand the opportunity to return to college requires both responsibility and accountability, as well as a collective attention to the rules developed by the state and SUNY Plattsburgh over the summer.
 I am proud our students are by and large following our health and safety rules both on and off campus. With the start of the semester, I met with managers at the largest local retail stores and shopping center. Each reported widespread adherence and an appreciation that our students are back. Masking and social distancing are regularly followed.
 Many community members have also reached out to me with notes and comments of support. I appreciate hearing from you.
 In some cases, I have had to take separate swift actions. I issued interim suspensions to on-campus students who allegedly violated our health, safety and other policies over the first weekend and a separate set of off-campus students who allegedly violated other standards. The student conduct process has concluded for the on-campus students, who left campus and then had hearings as a part of our prescribed policies. Some have returned and participated in COVID-19 testing. Some will not return.
 Regardless, it is my hope that each student learns and grows from this. We are educators first and with this comes growth. I continue to want the best for each student, which itself was a factor in the difficult decision I made.

 In light of this, Rep. Elise M. Stefanik’s re-election campaign is calling on her Democratic opponent, Tedra L. Cobb, to pull her ads criticizing the congresswoman over the issue.
 First, some background: On June 26, the New York Times published a story with the headline, “Russia Secretly Offered Afghan Militants Bounties to Kill U.S. Troops, Intelligence Says.” The article said CIA intelligence indicated that a Russian intelligence unit, linked to assassination attempts and other covert operations around the Western world, offered rewards to Taliban-linked Islamist militants in Afghanistan in exchange for confirmed kills of coalition troops, including Americans.

Shareholders look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. Tesla has $38.13 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.37. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than one indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. A debt ratio of 40% might be higher for one industry and normal for another.

LONDON (AP) — Fresh restrictions on social gatherings in England, potentially involving limits on pub opening hours, appear to be on the cards soon as the British government seeks to suppress a sharp spike in new coronavirus infections. British Health Secretary Matt Hancock said Friday that the country has to “come together” over the coming weeks to get on top of the spike, that he noted is leading to a doubling in the number of people being hospitalized with the virus every seven to eight days. Following days of criticism over its testing strategy, there is mounting speculation that the government will announce fresh curbs on the hospitality sector, such as pubs and restaurants, potentially involving curfews.

Angel Di Maria will also be summoned to the league’s next disciplinary commission meeting on September 23 over claims he spat at Marseille defender Gonzalez during PSG’s 1-0 loss which ended with a mass brawl and five players sent off.
 Neymar was sent off for slapping Gonzalez on the back of the head and accused the Spaniard of calling him a “monkey”. Gonzalez denies the allegation.
 “We know there was an exchange of words. But right now, there isn’t enough certainty to call in the players,” said Sebastien Deneux, president of the disciplinary commission.
 He said the investigation would study the footage further to determine whether there was enough evidence to substantiate the claims of racist abuse.
 The goal will be to establish “what was actually said and what was actually heard”, Deneux added, while insisting the commission would only rule on “objective, tangible elements.”
 The probe could also potentially interpret whether Neymar made homophobic remarks to Gonzalez, as reported by Spanish media.
 PSG defender Layvin Kurzawa incurred a six-match ban for kicking out at Marseille left-back Jordan Amavi, who was hit with a suspension of three games after he too was dismissed.
 Leandro Paredes was banned for two games after he was sent off for a clash with fellow Argentine Dario Benedetto, who was also red-carded and will be suspended for Marseille’s game with Saint-Etienne on Thursday.
