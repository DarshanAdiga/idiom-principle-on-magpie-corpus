Many of those encounters occur without incident. Asked about the Friday encounter, a spokesman for US Naval Forces Europe-Africa said the command does not comment on safe intercepts.
 But US has deemed some Russian behavior as "unsafe and unprofessional," as was the case in two encounters in mid-April, one of which saw a Russian fighter jet fly what the US Navy described as an "inverted maneuver" 25 feet in front of a P-8A.
 US Navy pilots train specifically for such encounters, but they are not limited to US aircraft. Russian jets intercepted a British reconnaissance plane over the Black Sea at the end of May. Russian jets have also buzzed NATO navy ships in the Black Sea, as they've done to US Navy ships in other parts of Europe.

The US Navy has spent "about 120 days a year" in the Black Sea, Adm. James Foggo, commander of US Naval Forces Europe-Africa, said in a speech on Thursday. US Navy dock landing ship USS Oak Hill and guided-missile destroyer USS Porter were both in the Black Sea this month, exercising with NATO navies and other partners.
 "Allied forces, like NATO's Standing Maritime Group, conducted about the same amount of patrols, so we maintain a Black Sea presence for about two-thirds of the year," Foggo said. "I think that's a wonderful demonstration of our commitment to our Black Sea allies and partners."
 Those interactions include military exercises and cultural exchanges, but increasing Russia activity in the region -- as well as tensions between NATO and Turkey, which has the largest and most capable naval force in the Black Sea of any NATO member there -- have prompted calls for the alliance to focus more attention on the region and employ new and different weapons and tactics to counter Moscow there.

"I think both sides are looking to avoid rapid escalation, so any military operations would be limited in scope and intensity," he said. "Both sides have nuclear weapons and thus that really limits how far they can push this crisis. If there is to be fighting, it would be short, intense battles, limited in geographic scope and the level of violence employed."
 Ben Ho, associate research fellow with the military studies programme at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore, said that if New Delhi were to exercise the military option, it would likely be a small-scale and calibrated one so as not to stoke tensions. Beijing also would likely respond proportionately, he said.
 "The primary strategic concern of Beijing is competing with the US in the western Pacific in the long run, and they would do well to minimise anything that diverts attention and resources from that endeavour," Ho said.
 Zhou Chenming, a Beijing-based military expert, said China had far more deployable weapons and better logistics support than India but Beijing would not want the situation to get out of control.

Salim said that it really breaks him when something like this comes up. He said that the creative process that gets hampered is just one level and there's more to it. "Sulaiman and I had worked on a project with a new director. The music turned out so good that it helped them get a really big actor on board. Then they took it to a big production house/record company, and they said, 'we love the film, but please change the composers.' They have some personal vendetta against us, I don't know why. It is about time that people find about it," Salim shared some anecdotes from his personal experience.
