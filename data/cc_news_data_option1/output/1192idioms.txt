JetBlue Airways Corporation, incorporated in Delaware in Aug 1998, is a passenger airline that focuses on providing high-quality customer service. JetBlue, which started operations on Feb 11, 2000, was the sixth largest passenger carrier (in terms of available seat miles or ASMs i.e. capacity) in the United States at 2018-end. The low-fare, low-cost carrier operates primarily on point-to-point routes. In 2018, the carrier transported more than 42 million customers to 105 cities in the United States, Caribbean and Latin America with an average of 1000 daily flights.In line with the carrier's efforts to promote a differentiated product and culture apart from competitive costs, JetBlue is constantly working toward expanding its premium product, the Mint service. The service includes 16 fully lie-flat seats, four of which are in suites with a privacy door, by adding seasonal service from John F. Kennedy International Airport, to Liberia, Costa Rica, and from Boston to St. Lucia.JetBlue currently operates Airbus A321, Airbus A320 and Embraer E190 planes. In 2018 , the average age of of the carrier's fleet was 9.8 years. Moreover, JetBlue flights operated an average of 11.8 hours per day in 2018.The carrier is constantly looking to modernize its fleet. To this end, the carrier took delivery of ten Airbus A321 planes, three of which were equipped with its Mint cabin layout. JetBlue expects to take delivery of atleast six Airbus A321new engine option (neo) aircraft in 2019. Options for delivery of 60 additional A220-300 aircraft are anticipated to commence in 2025The carrier, whose fiscal year coincides with the calender year, is also looking to remove outdated planes from its fleet as part of the modernization process. To this end, the carrier expects to reduce its fleet of Embraer E190 aircraft from 2020. The phase out is anticipated to continue through approximately 2025.The Long Island City, New York based company reported operating revenues of $7.7 billion in 2018, up 9.2%. The carrier is being aided by robust growth in passenger revenues owing to healthy demand for air travel. Passenger revenues account for bulk of the total revenues. As an evidence, passenger revenues accounted for 96.4% of the top line in 2018. Balance came from other sources.

Because many restaurants, especially independent ones, rely on the labor of immigrants living in the country illegally who wash dishes, bus tables and cook meals, Restaurant Opportunities Centers United is trying to raise $500,000 for an emergency relief fund in part to help them.
 Luis López Reséndiz, 26, got his last paycheck Friday from his part-time job as a buser in an Italian restaurant in downtown Los Angeles. A legal resident under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, he has a second job that he does from home. Many of the busboys he worked with are living here illegally and live off tips, he said.
 “I cannot imagine how hard it is for them right now,” he said. They have reached out to him, asking where they can get food or money. “They want to know where they can get a job where they don’t ask for papers. Many of them are scared.”
 Even for workers with legal standing and plenty of experience, the options are few. Amazon and most grocery stores have jobs; Domino’s Pizza is hiring 10,000 people nationally. But work could limit unemployment benefits and expose employees to the virus.
 Even applying for unemployment money is a struggle. Justin Alexander, 38, who worked for six years as a line cook at the Highland Bakery in Atlanta, is trying to finish the last pages of the application, which requires forms he doesn’t have on hand. If he is approved, he figures he might get $600 a month. His expenses, which include $1,100 in rent, a car payment and child support for his three children, total about $2,500 a month.
 He plans to dig into his small savings and see if can continue doing side work installing home electronics and security systems. But that doesn’t seem promising. “Nobody wants me in their homes right now,” he said.
 In Columbus, Ohio, Matt Grinstead-Mayle, 40, and his husband, Dale, 37, are making similar calculations. On Monday, Matt Grinstead-Mayle was staring at his last paycheck from the Pearl, where as a waiter he made about $1,000 a week, including tips. The check was for $25.01.
 His husband is a barber who recently started his own shop, Goodfellow’s. It closed, too. They have an 18-month-old son, a little in savings and a refrigerator full of food the restaurant group let employees have when the doors shut.
 Amazon and Kroger offered Matt Grinstead-Mayle night work, but another job doesn’t make sense right now. “I don’t feel the risk is worth exposing my family,” he said.
 The shock is starting to wear off, and they are formulating a survival plan. Once the government website stops crashing, Grinstead-Mayle hopes to submit an application for unemployment benefits. The couple’s insurance premiums have been waived for the time being, and they plan to apply for a small-business loan to save the barber shop.

The reduction in domestic flights is an escalation from its decision Sunday to cancel all international flights. This could have a significant impact at BWI Thurgood Marshall Airport in which Southwest is the largest carrier. BWI officials did not return an immediate request for comment.
   
 Customers with canceled flights have a few options, according to Southwest’s press release. A flight can be rebooked to change travel up to 60 days from the original flight at Southwest.com/rebook. Flights with available seating will display “available." A message on the company’s website states call volumes are high and officials recommend rebooking online.
 If passengers aren’t sure of future travel plans, they do not need to take any action. The funds used for the canceled trip will be available for the named customer through June 30, 2021. This is an extension of the company’s normal year from date of purchase, according to the press release. Customers can use their original confirmation number to access those funds.

Biden’s remarks came a day after Trump said that he wants to have the U.S. economy restarted by Easter on April 12, an ambitious goal that flies in the face of warnings from public health experts who say the worst of the coronavirus’s effects on the U.S. are still to come.
 “It’s such an important day for other reasons, but I’ll make it an important day for this, too,” Trump said from the White House Rose Garden. “I would love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter.”
 Trump argued that the economic consequences of the coronavirus outbreak – shuttered businesses, rising unemployment and turbulent financial markets – were more dire than the public health risks of the disease.
 “You are going to lose a number of people to the flu,” Trump said. “But you are going to lose more people by putting a country into a massive recession or depression.”
 In his briefing on Wednesday, Biden rejected Trump’s argument, saying that restarting the U.S. economy while Americans are still scrambling to slow the spread of the virus would only prolong the country’s fight against the disease and bring with it long-term consequences.

 “That would be far more devastating in the long run than implementing a thorough strategy, a thought-out strategy supported by science and scientists to get Americans back to work,” Biden said. “Because the only way we’ll fully solve the economic challenges is by first solving the public health crisis.”
 Tim Murtaugh, the Trump campaign’s communications director, said in a statement that Trump was listening to the advice of public health officials like Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
 “President Trump is protecting the health and safety of Americans and also safeguarding the economy. It’s true that our country was not built to be just switched off for an extended period of time,” Murtaugh said. “Joe Biden should listen to Dr. Fauci, who President Trump said he will be very much guided by, along with other scientists and health experts, as he makes these critical decisions. Dr. Fauci has said that President Trump has ‘never’ made a decision that went against the science-based advice he provided.”

ABU DHABI, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News / WAM - 25th Mar, 2020) The UAE Cabinet directed the Ministry of Justice and the "Supreme Judicial Council" to adopt temporary controls to regulate the work of courts and assess hearings and executive cases for a period of one month, which can be extended to meet emergency conditions.
 This step is part of the preventive measures to preserve the health of society and the safety of its members in the face of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19, as well as to enable UAE citizens and residents to complete their judicial transactions in light of current conditions.
 The UAE Cabinet’s directive also aims to preserve the health and safety of those working for judicial authorities by postponing cases and appeals that cannot be settled within a period of one month, as well as by assessing expenditures, temporary and urgent matters, smart requests, criminal lawsuits and appeals, including from detainees and prisoners.
 Exceptions will be made in cases where the law does not require the parties to appear before the Federal Supreme Court, along with cases of expenditures, temporary and urgent matters, smart requests, criminal cases and appeals, and implementation issues related to expense and labour cases.

“It’s just obvious people are going to need to move” if local facilities are overwhelmed, he said. “If we’re able to find a ventilator bed in Indianapolis, in Chicago or Minneapolis or wherever, it is go, get them there!”
 Yet experts warn that even areas comparatively rich in ICU beds could be overwhelmed with patients struggling to breathe, a common symptom of seriously ill COVID-19 patients.
 “No matter how you look at it, the numbers (of ICU beds) are too small,” said Dr. Atul Grover, executive vice president of the Association of American Medical Colleges. “It’s scary.”
 Lenard Kaye, director of the University of Maine Center on Aging, a state with a large older population and relatively few ICU beds, agreed. “The implications are tremendous and very troubling,” he said. “Individuals are going to reach out for help in an emergency, and those beds may well not be available.”
 Health workers might need to resort to “triaging and tough decisions,” Kaye said, “on who beds are allocated to.”
 That concern isn’t lost on Linnea Olsen, 60, who has lung cancer and knows she is especially vulnerable to any respiratory virus.
 Olsen worries about a potential shortage of ventilators and ICU beds, which could lead doctors to ration critical care. Given her fragile health, she fears she wouldn’t make the cut.
 “I’m worried that cancer patients will be a low priority,” said Olsen, a mother of three adult children, who lives in Amesbury, Mass.
 Olsen, who was diagnosed with lung cancer almost 15 years ago, has survived far longer than most people with the disease. She is now being treated with an experimental medication — which has never been tested before in humans in an early-stage clinical trial. It’s her fourth early clinical trial.
 “I’m no longer young, but I still would argue that my life is worthwhile, and my three kids certainly want to keep me around,” she said.
 She said she has “fought like hell to stay alive” and worries she won’t be given a fighting chance to survive COVID-19.
 “Those of us with lung cancer are among the most vulnerable,” Olsen said, “but instead of being viewed as someone to be protected, we will be viewed as expendable. A lost cause.”
 Overall, 26 million people live in counties with hospitals but no ICU, about a quarter of them older than 60. Nearly 11 million more Americans reside in counties with no hospital, some 2.7 million of them seniors.
 The total number of ICU beds nationally varies, depending on which source is consulted and which beds are counted. Hospitals reported 75,000 ICU beds in their most recent annual financial reports to the government, but that excludes Veterans Affairs’ facilities.
 The United States has about three times as many ICU beds per capita as Italy and 10 times as many as China, two countries ravaged by COVID-19, according to a new report from the Society of Critical Care Medicine. The supply of ventilators also exceeds other developed countries, another study found. But as with ICU beds, “there is wide variation (in ventilators available) across states,” the study found.
 Many experts predict that demand may soon exceed the supply. Over a period of months, the country may need 1.9 million ICU beds — 20 times the current supply to treat COVID-19 patients, according to the American Hospital Association.

He said recommendations by the World Health Organization and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration established hand-sanitizing standards that feature very high concentrations of denatured alcohol, which is not something found in Balcones’ products or in whiskey production generally.
 “For now, we are calling what we’re producing ‘high-proof distillate’ for use as a surface cleaner. We’ve delivered bottles to local health care facilities,” said Mote, referencing the 3.4-ounce containers so far produced. The Balcones news release issued before production was temporarily halted said the company hoped to produce 18,000 bottles of hand sanitizer by month’s end.
 These would be made available free of charge to “those in need, including first responders, hospitals and other essential businesses both in Texas and across the country,” the release states. “As the distillery continues with production, the team will be identifying additional organizations in need of hand sanitizer, as well as other methods to support the community at this time.”
 Mote said he was scheduled to speak again with FDA officials at mid-afternoon Wednesday, “and we could be back in business tomorrow.”

Up the mountain. Number of infections that have been coming in 80% still self resolve. About 15%. Of the people who test positive. Require hospitalization. And then there are degrees of hospitalization. Great but the total universe. That requires house organization is 15%. Need. We used projection models. We have Cornell Wilde which is a great medical institution that does projection models we use McKinsey that those projection models department of health those projection models. The projection models are important because they are projecting the possible trajectory. And projecting the possible need right so we're planning for a need. The projection models do that. The projection models are just that they are models of projections they're not. Necessarily definitive but it's the only device that we have to plan. Cracked follow the data follow the data follow through data. The actual hospitalizations. Have moved at a higher rate then the projected models than roll the projector models. So that was obviously concerned. The evidence suggests. That the density control measures. May be worked through. And again we're doing this from projections. But look at this because its interest in. This past Sunday. The projection was that hospitalizations we're doubling every two days okay. On Monday and the numbers suggest that that the hospitalizations were doubling every 3.4. Days. On Tuesday. The projections suggested at the hospitalizations. Were doubling every four point seven days. Now. That is almost too good to be true. Thought. Bit theory is. Given the density that we're dealing with. It spreads very quickly. But if you reduce the density you can reduce the spread. Very quickly. Personal opinion. Why does New York cab so many more cases than any other state. How can it be your fifteen times the number. Of California. I mean it really is. Breathtaking when you think about it stripped Massachusetts with thirty times the number of cases. So why is the question that people ask me. Two answers it's a Warne is because when you. Welcome people. From across the glow. We have people coming here who we have people who came here from China who came here from Italy who came here crew. Countries all around the globe. We have international travelers. Who were in China and weren't Italy and who were in Korea and who came here. And I have no doubt that the virus was here much earlier than we even know. And I have no doubt that the virus was here much earlier than it wasn't any other states. Because those people come here first. Test the first dance. The second the answer is. Because we are close. Because we are close. We talk about. Did the virus and how it transfers in the dense area. It's literally because we are close. Because. We live close to one another. Because we're close to wouldn't know there on the streets. Because we live in close communities. Because we're close to order another on the boss. We're close to one another in the restaurant with close to one another in the movie theater. And we have. Wounded them. Most dense close. Environments. In the country. And that's what time the virus. Communicated the way it did it. Our closeness. Makes us vulnerable. Our closeness makes us vulnerable that. Space show closeness makes us vulnerable. But it's true. That your greatest weakness is also your greatest strength. And in our closeness. Is what makes us who we know our. That is what New York kids are closeness is what makes us special. Our acceptance our openness is what makes us special. It it's what makes us feel so connected to one to another. It's what makes this so accepting. Of Warren another. It is the closeness. That makes us the human beings that we Yong. The closeness. Is that New York humanity. That I think exists nowhere else. The closeness. Do is what makes our sense. Of community. And this is a gentleman who. I still look too. Four. Guidance and for leadership and for inspiration. He's not here anymore. For you he still here for me. But he said things. More profound and more beautifully than. Most other people ever happen. And one of the things he said that is so appropriate for today. We believe in a single fundamental idea that describes better than most textbooks in any speech that I could write what a proper government should be. The idea of family. Mutuality. The sharing of benefits and burdens for the good overall feeling wounded and others paying. Schering wouldn't others blessings. Reasonably. Honestly. Fairly and without respect to race or sex would geography. Or political affiliation. That is New York. It is that closeness. That concept a friendly of community. That's. What makes new York new York. And that's. What made us vulnerable here. But it is also that closeness. And that connection and that humanity. And that share. That is our greatest strength. And that is what is going to overcome. At the end of the day. I promise you that. I can see how New Yorkers are responding. I can see how to New Yorkers. Are treating one another are exceeded 6000 mental health volunteers received a 40000. Health care workers stepping up. I see the vendors calling me saying I can help that's New York. That's new.

The numbers and statics don't lie. Right now, they are the biggest target for contracting COVID-19. The "I'm young and healthy" stance is not working out very well for them at all. Then, those that are strong enough to not get ill can be walking virus donors for those that are receptive to being critically ill.
 It is not only millennials. Others also have adopted the theory of "I won't get sick." It's sad that the choices made may not only affect the health of such as these thinkers, but those around them. Most all of them have family, including ones with underlying health conditions, who give them hugs and always welcome them with open arms. They are attending and planning get- togethers in each other's homes. Parents are still planning home birthday parties.
 The question is how do we get them to understand and step up to the plate in doing the right thing for themselves and others, follow the rules in place. I fear for this generation right now and others that think "It won't happen to me." That could be an epitaph for too many from COVID-19 right now.

The Haviland Care Center, a Mission Health Community located in Haviland, has taken up protocols and precautions to protect their patients, residents and staff from the threat of COVID-19. A strict no visitation policy went into effect on March 9. Communal dining and all group activities have been suspended, frequent reminders are given to practice hand hygiene and social distancing. All patients, staff and residents are regularly screened for signs of fever and respiratory symptoms, according to a press release from Mission Health.
   
 "The protection of our residents from infectious disease is our utmost concern to us all," said Karel Page, Haviland Care Center Administrator. "In light of the gravity of current circumstances, we have taken the serious step, in accordance with guidelines from Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to close our Community to visitors until further notice. This includes all outside visitors and non-essential health care personnel."
   
 Exceptions to this rule may include end-of-life situations and will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Hospice workers, EMS personnel, dialysis technicians and others will be allowed to enter with frequent health screenings and personal protective equipment.
   
 "This is not easy for us," Page said. "We know how important personal connection is for residents and their family members. But the threat of COVID-19 is so great for older people and those with underlying health conditions, that we must do everything possible to protect the entire Community."
   
 The Haviland Care Center is happy to help coordinate family members connection with their loved ones via telephone, text, video chat, email or social media.
   
 "Even as we need to practice being physically apart for now, we are committed to finding ways for people to be together," Page said. "Because that's how we'll all get through this together."

For a brief moment last month, it appeared that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had actually answered some of these questions for those in pursuit of the hirsute — and provided a hilariously detailed visual chart of "safe" facial-hair styles to boot. Unfortunately, that infographic, which was issued in 2017, had nothing to do with the current coronavirus epidemic and was intended as a guide for workers required to wear respirators at work.
 Dr. John Swartzberg, clinical professor emeritus at UC Berkeley's School of Public Health who studies infectious diseases, said he doesn't know of any scientific study that addresses facial hair and the transmission of the coronavirus. "The only thing that comes to mind is the fitting of the N95 mask — or any mask for that matter," he said.

We turned, almost accidentally, to a topic-specific newsletter to share our COVID-19-related content. The Missourian had three newsletters, with no plans to add more. But the Missourian also is a real-time industry lab. My goal is to infuse a greater spirit of experimentation throughout our newsroom culture. To work on product development challenges that arise in smaller, local newsrooms with scarce resources, I am participating in the six-week Product Immersion for Small Newsroom training, an intensive six-week training by NewsCatalyst and the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at CUNY, developed in partnership with Google News Initiative.

County Executive Officer Minh Tran said that's not true for the Board of Supervisors. That means Board action to place the proposed measures on the ballot might trigger the need for environmental impact reports or less- detailed documents.
 Initiative proponents would in normal times take tables and clipboards to shopping centers and collect signatures outside of stores. Hackett stressed that steps to try to stop the spread of COVID-19 have priority over the proposed watershed measure.
 “I don’t want to come across here that this (measure) is more important than life-and-death,” he said. “Because it’s not. We hope that at some point in the fall, things will return to normal and the issue of protecting our watersheds and water supplies will still be a viable concern for citizens.”

“Several dozen eggs for a good source of protein you can use them for baking, stir fries, hard boiled and frozen veggies taste good on them,” Piven says. Get protein bars if you like them, or jerky. If you have a stand-alone freezer, stock up on meat “if you get to the point where you cannot eat one more bean,” Piven says. He also recommends tofu and canned fish, which also keeps well on the shelf.

(CNN) - If you want to avoid getting sick or spreading germs, you’re constantly told to wash your hands or slather on the hand sanitizer.Washing our hands with soap and water is one of the most important things we can do right now to help stop the spread of coronavirus, the flu and other illnesses, and it does that by breaking down the cells of the virus itself.Underneath the spiky outside of the coronavirus are the outer layers of cells, made up of lipids or fats.When you wash dishes covered in fats like grease or butter with only water, nothing happens. The same thing happens to the virus germs.But add soap, and the grease - or in this case the lipid layer - breaks down, and that means it can’t bind to your skin.Protect yourself and others by washing your hands with soap and water.Then when you rinse your hands at the end, it washes the virus off.To be completely effective, make sure you're really scrubbing with the soap, building up bubbles and getting all parts of your hands and under your nails for twenty seconds.If you're out and about, hand sanitizer with 60-percent alcohol can be used to sanitize your hands as well.Coronavirus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person through droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes.But just like with traditional washing, you really need to rub the sanitizer all over your hands. And while it kills the virus, it's not rinsing it off, like with water.So if you're hands are extra dirty, it's going to take a lot more sanitizer to clean them.Remember, handwashing is just one of ways recommended to stop the spread of COVID-19.The others are covering your nose and mouth when you sneeze and cough, avoiding touching your face, practicing social distancing by staying at least 6 feet away from others, and if you’re sick, stay home.Copyright 2020 CNN.

 The $6 billion that just walked out the door with the postponement of the 2020 Olympics is only the start of the hits Japan's economy will sustain this year.
 That estimated loss from the Summer Games being delayed until 2021 was not on any executive's radar two months ago. Nor was the idea of Japan losing virtually all tourism as the coronavirus ravaged global growth. This year's festivities were supposed to be Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's crowning glory. Yet 2020 is now darkening by the day.
 Economists from rating agency Fitch Ratings think the coronavirus pandemic will shave 1.1% off Japan's gross domestic product this year. They might want to move the decimal place to the right: a 10% fall is more likely than 1%.
 The problem is that Abe and Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda are confronting deeply unconventional challenges with convention. A moderately sized spending package and tweaks to the Bank of Japan's asset purchases are no match for the economic winter to come.
 The fault is not Japan's, of course. The COVID-19 outbreak that started in China is an existential threat everywhere. But Abe's seven-plus years at the helm make him fair game for criticism.
 The global context is bleak. U.S. growth is cratering at this very moment, by as much as 30% in the second quarter alone, says bank Morgan Stanley. China is also seeing growth disappear, no matter what figure President Xi Jinping's minions will try to get past investors. Nor can we likely trust Beijing's claims it has beaten the coronavirus scourge and that China can avoid a second wave of infections.
 Europe faces a reckoning as the sharp cessation of demand hits business and consumer confidence and travel bans shut down the tourism trade. In a world without growth engines, Tokyo must throw out the playbook it used after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, when it tossed extra spending measures at slowing growth.
 So what should Japan be doing? The best option is for the Ministry of Finance and BOJ to join forces, acting simultaneously. A combined fiscal and monetary operation is needed to calm nerves about the pain to come. What might a credible action plan look like?
