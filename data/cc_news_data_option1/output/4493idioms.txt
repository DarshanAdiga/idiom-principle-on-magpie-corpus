MAUMEE - Lawrance Hamilton Romaine II, 91, Maumee, left this world peacefully at home with his wife and youngest daughter by his side on September 21, 2020, after years of battling COPD. He was lovingly cared for by Hospice of Northwest Ohio for the last few weeks of life and their assistance was priceless.   Born in Chicago on July 22, 1929, to Elizabeth Pochay and Lawrance Romaine Sr., Larry had one sister, Mary Louise Hoeffel; and a half sister, Vicki Kehias. All of the childhood stories about Larry always involved trouble that in way or another, he ended up talking his way out of. In high school he met his lifelong friends, and they called themselves the Dumscheitz. It goes without saying that there was more trouble found by that group. They had reunions well into their 80s.   He met his wife and daughter, Kris, in 1971 when they moved into the same apartment complex. Larry's oldest daughter, Caron, and only son, Larry, set their sights on Carolyn and made sure they saw each other frequently. He and Carolyn were married the same year at St. Petri Lutheran church in Toledo and he adopted Kris in 1972.   Larry was born in Chicago, but lived in Cleveland and Defiance in his youth. He also took Carolyn and Kris to live in New Orleans, La., and Coral Springs, Fla., where they had some interesting adventures during the 1970s, including living in a hotel for three months with two cats and taking up square dancing. Larry loved to cook, and his favorites were from his family heritage, Hungarian stuffed cabbage and chicken paprikas. He was very interested in genealogy, investigating his connections in the world and looking into his Hungarian roots. He also spoke Hungarian.   Larry graduated from Defiance High School in 1947 and did not make it to college until he was in his 70s, when he started taking classes at The University of Toledo. You would never know he did not have a degree as he was smart as a whip and could speak intelligently about any topic under the sun. His favorite topics, however, were politics and Indians baseball. He helped run numerous Republican political campaigns with Carolyn, watched the news voraciously and he rarely missed an Indians game, so he had plenty to discuss. He also loved to discuss his military service, where he served on the USS Philippine Sea, ending in 1950. You rarely saw him without his Navy hat and he proudly wore it to Washington, D.C., when he was taken on an Honor Flight in 2017.   He worked most of his life in the wholesale food industry, but he was also a financial advisor, and with Carolyn, he owned and ran a square dance clothing store and a deli called Hoagie Toledo. They also took care of their two grandsons prior to them starting school and then ran their school cafeteria when they started at St. Joseph Catholic school in Maumee. He was not afraid of change and looked for new opportunities wherever they presented themselves.   He is survived by his wife, Carolyn; his daughter, Caron Fickling; daughter, Kristin (Mike) Blochowski; his grandchildren, Terry Fickling, Lindsey Fickling, Luke Blochowski and Josh Blochowski; his sister, Mary Louise Hoeffel; many more family members, many friends and four very loud dogs. Leaving this world before him were his father, Lawrance Romaine; his mother, Elizabeth Fowler; and his son, Larry Romaine III.   Larry's big personality, off-colored expressions and jokes, and honest, straightforward but grumpy demeanor will be missed by all who loved him. A memorial service celebrating his life was held on Tuesday, September 29, at St. James Lutheran Church. The family asks that in lieu of flowers, donations be made to St. James Lutheran church to assist with funeral/other expenses.

WASHINGTON -- If Democrat Joe Biden wins the U.S. presidency, a divided Congress may prevent him from enacting major priorities like expanding healthcare, fighting climate change and providing aid to millions whose lives have been upended by the coronavirus.
 With millions of ballots yet to be counted, Biden led incumbent President Donald Trump in several of the battleground states that will decide the contest.
 Yet his Democrats were coming up short in their effort to win control of the Senate, where Republicans currently hold a 53-47 majority, even as they retained control of the House of Representatives.
 If those results hold, that would be a recipe for gridlock in Washington, analysts say, where lawmakers would struggle to agree even on basic duties like paying debts and funding government operations.
 More ambitious efforts would likely be off the table entirely.
 A multi-trillion-dollar plan to curb carbon emissions and create jobs would founder in the Senate.
 Biden's plan to raise taxes on corporations and wealthy individuals would also be dead in the water, as would voting-rights and campaign-finance reforms backed by Democrats.
 Biden also will likely have to settle for a much smaller economic stimulus package. Democrats have passed several bills out of the House that would provide up to $3.4 trillion to provide assistance to millions of jobless people and help local governments keep teachers, firefighters and other employees on the payroll.
 Senate Republicans have so far refused to pass anything at all, though their leader Mitch McConnell said on Wednesday that the two sides needed to find compromise by the end of the year. He did, however, show willingness to meet a key Democratic demand - more money for state and local governments.
 "The message from Senate Republicans is going to be: 'The American people elected us to tap a brake on this unrequited socialism that Democrats are going to try to bring to this country,'" said Jon Lieber, a former McConnell aide now with the Eurasia Group.
 Lacking a majority on Capitol Hill, Biden could issue executive orders to pursue smaller-bore agenda items, like student-loan relief and consumer protections.
 That go-it-alone approach, used by Trump and Democratic President Barack Obama before him, could be easily undone by a Republican successor.
 Coronavirus and Cabinet
 On his first day in the White House, Biden says, he will issue a national strategy to respond to COVID-19 that will likely include a mask mandate and clearer guidance on testing and school reopenings. He has also promised to work more productively with health officials that Trump has ignored, such as Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious-disease expert.
 But a Republican Senate could reject Cabinet appointees they deem too liberal, forcing Biden to opt for consensus picks that might frustrate those on his party's left wing.
 "We want to make sure that people who are implementing parts of his (climate change) plan are not people who are aligned with the fossil-fuel industry, are not corporate lobbyists," said Garrett Blad, national spokesman of the Sunrise Movement, a grassroots group pushing for aggressive action on climate change.
 Biden campaigned as a centrist who would try to work across partisan divides, and as a member of the Senate from 1972 to 2008 has a deep knowledge of its workings and personal relationships with many of its members.
 "Look for him to drive long-standing priorities of his like infrastructure, where he could perhaps find support from a moderate Republican or two," said Scott Mulhauser, a Democratic strategist who worked for Biden in the 2012 presidential election.
 But many of Biden's former Republican colleagues have retired or been voted out, leaving a more conservative majority that is less inclined to compromise.
 "These periods of split-party control tend not to be very productive," said Sarah Binder, a political science professor at George Washington University.
 Facing another two years of gridlock, Democrats would likely focus on winning a Senate majority in the next congressional election in November 2022.
 But that could turn out poorly for Democrats if Washington does not takes dramatic steps to bolster the economy, improve health-care and curb climate change, said Adam Jentleson, a former Democratic Senate leadership aide.
 "The real danger scenario for Biden and Democrats is that Republicans force all of the solutions to be inadequate and Democrats take them because they have to," he said.

“They were successful running the football because they executed well,” said Hampshire Coach Aaron Rule.
 “They blocked down on our D-Line, kicked out our ends and wrapped up on our LBs to a T.”
 The Pat offense mimicked the “3 yards and cloud of dust” mentality seen decades ago, as they combined for 437 yards on the ground with 49 rushing attempts to average 8.9 yards per carry.
 “We are over analyzing and overthinking things defensively instead of just going out there and running to the football with relentless pursuit and being playmakers,” remarked Coach Rule.
 Washington attempted only 2 passes throughout the game and the lone completion was a 2-yard touchdown toss from Frankie Amore to Tyler Meisenzahl in the 2nd quarter.
 From start to finish, the men in red controlled the game as Washington jumped out to a 14-0 lead after the 1st quarter, then added another 21 points in the 2nd stanza to take a 35-0 lead.
 Trailing by 5 touchdowns, the Trojans didn’t quit, as the offensive line did a solid job blocking to create an open lane for RB Stephen Leonard, who rumbled down the sideline for a 37-yard touchdown. Senior Christian Hicks drilled the PAT to give HHS 7 points just before halftime.
 Neither team was able to gain any traction after halftime, but Washington’s focus was to run out the clock and remain healthy for postseason play.
 The Pats added their final touchdown in the 4th quarter as their subs were given an opportunity to play and backup QB Rodrigo Delgado tallied the touchdown.
 It was evident for those who follow Hampshire that the team went away from its traditional throw-first offense. The Trojans ran the ball 29 times for a total of 69 yards compared to 16 passing attempts with 4 completions.
 Credit Coach Rule for trying to use some creativity to throw off the Pat defense using the wildcat formation with WR Trevor Sardo receiving snaps.
 “Our thought process is get the ball in the hands of our better athletes,” explained Rule.
 “We put the ball in Sardo, (Alex) Hott and (Nevin) Ludwick’s hands early on in hopes to establish a run game. We are very young at the slots and those guys are still very green when it comes to blocking and route running and it showed

In 1992, Gov. Doug Wilder — fighting a losing battle for new taxes to shore up Medicaid — summoned to his office several Black senators. Among them: first- term Democrat Louise Lucas of Portsmouth. Wilder pressed Lucas and the others to support his levy on hospitals, derided as a “sick tax.”
 Ever transactional, Wilder said some of the Black senators owed their seats to him. Had it not been for his tweaks to the 1991 redistricting plan, which boosted Black membership in the House of Delegates and Virginia Senate, they might never have been elected.
 Lucas, who over three decades has made clear she’s not one to be pushed around, was furious. She told Wilder she had won that seat in her own right, that she — not he — had driven thousands of miles, campaigning across the district. It then stretched from gritty Portsmouth, west about 135 miles, to the tobacco farms of Mecklenburg County.

I made it be known that I believed I made a killing shot on the buck. He disagreed again – and then asked if I would take his picture with the deer! In any other place, and a few years earlier, I likely would have reacted differently, but for once, I let rational thinking trump my emotions. Instead of dropping the dude where he stood, I again let him know that I believed in my shot but ended up taking his picture with what was, in fact, my deer. As upset as I was, I just knew that nothing good would come of it if I responded how I really wanted to.
 To add substance to my decision to back off was the fact that I also have a parcel that I can hunt that joins the property where this happened at, and I need to access that piece via the one where this incident occurred, as the other piece is landlocked and accessible only via an easement on the property where this all went down. Oh, yeah, this cat who took the buck also has a stand right on the fencerow to the other parcel, which he cannot hunt, but it did not stop him from shooting a buck across the fence last year.
 I had never experienced anything like this before. I’ve heard stories of other hunters who have been in this situation, but until having to share the property with this guy, I had always been fortunate enough to have a couple of spots to myself. Now I can relate to those who have had this same problem before, and it sucks.
 So, I licked my wounds for a few weeks, crying about it to anyone that would listen, and most folks agreed that I did the right thing by not making a big scene out there. Some even saying, “Hey, you might just kill a bigger one later on this season.” I wasn’t so sure about that, and even if I did make the right decision, it sure didn’t feel good. After all, how often do we get opportunities on a great buck? We hope to get one a year, so I felt as though mine was lost. But I kept my head up and continued hunting. I guess sometimes showing grace puts a burden on the one who shows it and not on the one to whom it is given. After all, sometimes the one it is given to likely doesn’t appreciate it anyway. That’s OK; do the right thing anyway.
 Doing the right thing worked out for the best for me. Instead of having an ongoing battle with the landowner that would only end in misery, we now at least try to half-way work together – the best that we can anyway, so that’s good. Plus, a few weeks after this incident, I arrowed the biggest buck of my life. A behemoth that grosses in the high 180s. Now, I realize that such an outcome is extremely rare and that the odds of going buckles for the season were higher than tagging a world-class buck. But hey, I’ll take it!
 The question of who a deer belongs to when shot by more than one hunter can be a tough one for sure and relies on where the deer is hit and on both parties being ethical.
 If a deer is shot immortally and merely wounded, then it is pretty obvious that the hunter who put the animal down is the rightful owner. In a case such as mine, however, where both shots were likely lethal, it all boils down to ethics, not legality. The ethical thing to do is to surrender the animal to the first person who mortally shot the deer.
 When it comes to big bucks, though, many won’t do that. That’s when another set of ethics come into play. Is it OK to argue over the deer, possibly even go to court over it? Sure, but is it right? Probably not. As hard as it is to do, perhaps the best decision for you to make is to show some grace when the other party chooses not to.
 Nothing good will ever come from a confrontation in such a situation, and you never know, showing someone some grace – even if you believe they don’t deserve it – may just be the best decision you could make.

 # Trevor Bauer, as expected, rejects Cincinnati Reds' qualifying offer
 Bobby Nightengale
 Cincinnati Enquirer
 View Comments
 Trevor Bauer rejected his one-year, $18.9 million qualifying offer on Thursday, according to a tweet from his agent.
 It was an expected move and is typically a formality for top free agents. Six players were extended qualifying offers this year: Bauer, J.T. Realmuto (Philadelphia Phillies), George Springer (Houston Astros), DJ LeMahieu (New York Yankees), Marcus Stroman (New York Mets) and Kevin Gausman (San Francisco Giants).
 The move doesn't affect the Cincinnati Reds' pursuit of Bauer in free agency, but it assures them of draft-pick compensation if he signs with another team. The draft pick could be after the first round or before the third round depending on the guaranteed total of Bauer's contract.
 Bauer had until Nov. 11 to accept or decline the qualifying offer. Just eight of the 90 players who have been extended qualifying offers have chosen to accept them since it was established in 2012, according to MLB.com, and one of those players, José Abreu, later signed a three-year contract extension.
 "Why wait for the QO to expire to state the obvious (plus @BauerOutage believes the QO is a ridiculous process so let’s just put it to bed)," tweeted Rachel Luba, Bauer's agent. "Trevor Bauer has rejected the QO but not the Reds and he looks forward to speaking w/ them and all other interested teams thru Free Agency."
 Bauer, a finalist to win the National League Cy Young, is the top pitcher on the free-agent market and could sign for the largest annual salary among all free agents. The Reds are considered longshots to sign him as he's expected to draw interest from several World Series contenders, but the Reds want to try to bring him back.
 For his part, Bauer said Reds pitching coach Derek Johnson was probably the best coach he's had in his career and raved about assistant pitching coach Caleb Cotham. He often trains at the Driveline facility near Seattle, and Driveline's founder, Kyle Boddy, is the Reds' minor-league pitching coordinator.
 Tucker Barnhart called Bauer "one of my favorite teammates that I've ever had" after he won his Gold Glove award on Tuesday.
 "The guy's a bulldog," Barnhart said. "He's a competitor. He wants to rip your head off when you're playing against him, but he's one of the nicest dudes to be a teammate of. I hope I don't have to face him. I really don't; that would suck. I really would like for him to stick around Cincinnati, but he has to do what's best for him and his family, and hopefully that's in Cincinnati."
 Bauer could become the first Reds pitcher to win a Cy Young in franchise history. The winner will be announced on Nov. 11.
