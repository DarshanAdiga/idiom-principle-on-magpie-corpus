"One (goal) I can't blame because of icing and a hook so that one you've just got to toss away, it happens," said Hurricanes coach Rod Brind'Amour. "We weren't ready to play. I mean, at the end of the day, there were two periods where we didn't do anything. You can't expect to win that way. We were flat."

BOSTON -- They've had a hard time satisfying themselves and their fans for the last month. The least the Bruins could do is make their moms proud.
 They have that chance (or maybe, they face that pressure) on Tuesday night at Bridgestone Arena in Nashville, where the mothers will watch their sons try to to stop a three-game losing streak (0-1-2) and a much longer, 15-game dip over which they've won only four times.
 "A lot of times the dads get a lot of the credit, and a lot of these trips are based around (fathers)," winger Brad Marchand said after the moms watched Monday's practice. "So it's great to have our moms here, and take care of them for once."
 Taking care of business against the Predators, one of the teams that has contributed to the Bruins' recent slide, would make for a pleasant, relaxed charter flight home.
 With a 4-5-6 record since an eight-game winning streak through Dec. 3, the B's have given back a good chunk of the double-digit points leads they held over Atlantic Division foes when they were a gaudy 20-3-5. The Maple Leafs, 15 points behind and below the playoff line at that time, were on a 9-0-1 run entering Monday's home game against the Oilers, and had a chance to close within four points. The Lightning - 16 points back through Dec. 3 - had used a seven-game win streak to pull within seven points.
 "Yeah, a few teams have (closed in)," Marchand said. "There definitely needs to be that urgency in here. We can't look at our last month and accept it and be happy with it."
 Coach Bruce Cassidy, who has the advantage of a relatively healthy lineup at his disposal, thinks the Bruins could be just as close to a surge as to a continued plunge. As evidence, Cassidy points to the six extended-time losses over the last 15 games -- including the 5-4 overtime defeat the Predators handed them on Dec. 21, which left the B's 1-4-4 over nine games.
 "We would have liked to turn some of those into wins, obviously," the coach said. "It makes everyone's peace of mind a little better, but it is what it is.
 "But we're in every game, it seems like. That's a positive. We've just got to find a way to start winning our share a little more than we have lately."
 The Bruins have fallen back since three straight wins from Dec. 23-29 because they haven't been able to score. They've been held to four goals over the 0-1-2 slip, with only one of those goals coming at even strength. So they need more than their red-hot power play (at least one goal in each of the last 10 games) and perfect penalty-killing (no goals allowed in the last seven) to move in a better direction.
 "It's not a big swing, I don't believe," said Cassidy, who scrapped special teams drills on Monday in favor of extra five-on-five work. "It's not like we have all these holes in our game that we can't fix. I believe they're fixable, and we've got to start (on Tuesday).
 "That's probably taking care of the puck a little better here and there (in the defensive and neutral zones), finishing a play at the other end, or having a little more of a shot mentality."
 If Cassidy needs any other ideas, he can always reach out to Marchand's mother, Lynn - whom her son describes as "very dedicated, very loud, very lippy" as a fan, but no slouch when it comes to strategy.
 "She still texts me before every game and tells me what to do," Marchand said. "She's a coach behind the scenes.
 "She's watched a ton of hockey. My dad's always been a coach, and was one of my coaches, so she hears a lot of what he tells me to do, and I think she likes to reiterate that."
 Fighting the bug
 Winger Joakim Nordstrom became the latest Bruin hit by the flu, and didn't travel to Nashville. Par Lindholm will fill out the fourth line against the Predators.
 Defenseman Matt Grzelcyk, who was too sick to play in Saturday's 4-1 loss to the Oilers, was back at practice on Monday.

Reaching Istanbul’s Ataturk Airport would take just over 12 hours. The team ferrying Ghosn appeared to have chosen its route carefully. From Osaka the plane headed north-northwest, avoiding South Korea — which has an extradition treaty with Japan — and then crossing into Russian airspace, where it remained for almost its entire journey. That wasn’t the most direct route, which would have taken the jet over China, Mongolia and Kazakhstan. But it did keep Ghosn over a country where he has considerable connections, thanks to his work rescuing AvtoVAZ, a troubled Soviet-era automaker that’s now part of the Renault-Nissan alliance. If the Japanese government had demanded his plane be stopped, he might have hoped for sympathy, or at least stalling, from Moscow.
 In fact, the Japanese authorities seemed to have no idea Ghosn was no longer in the country, and the Bombardier landed in Istanbul at around 5:30 a.m. local time on Dec. 30. Changing planes at Ataturk could expose Ghosn once again to detection. Just as at Kansai, according to a Turkish official who asked not to be identified discussing the details of the government’s subsequent investigation, Ghosn made the short trip inside a box. The second jet, a shorter-range Bombardier, took off shortly after for the brief flight to Beirut.

Nor is Ghosn entirely in the clear. While Lebanon is a nation that refuses, as a matter of policy, to extradite its citizens for trial abroad, he’s probably stuck there indefinitely. Japan has requested that Interpol issue a so-called Red Notice in Ghosn’s name, making it known to other law enforcement authorities that the country considers him a fugitive. His life as a globe- trotting member of the corporate elite is, at least for the foreseeable future, over.
