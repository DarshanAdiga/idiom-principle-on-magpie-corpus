Moscow, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 13th Mar, 2020 ) :Armed with a selfie stick holding a dosimeter-equipped smartphone, nuclear physicist Andrei Ozharovsky is on the hunt for gamma radiation.
 Waving the device over a shallow dip in the thawing ground, the contraption crackles as the reading climbs, turning first yellow then red.
 The dosimeter is picking up spots of elevated gamma radiation on the tree- lined hill close to a busy commuter train station and blocks of flats.
 But what concerns Ozharovsky and local residents most is the plan to build an eight-lane motorway over the slope, which contains radioactive waste buried in the pre-Chernobyl Soviet era.
 Nearby, work is already in full swing for the new road.
 "The real horror is that we are standing on the exact spot where the highway is planned," says Ozharovsky, who has examined the site over the past year.
 "As soon as you remove the surface layer, it registers elevated levels. That means we are standing on top of radioactive waste," he says, as the figure on the dosimeter increases to over one microsieverts per hour, meaning that if you stood there for an hour you would be exposed to one microsieverts of radiation.
 That is more than three times higher than background radiation, and, while still not dangerous to be around, indicates higher levels underground that would be spread as dust and end up in people's lungs, Ozharovsky says.
 Russian building regulations require additional inspections of sites with radiation of over 0.6 microsieverts per hour to determine if a cleanup is possible before a decision on construction can be taken.
 But documentation for the highway project -- part of a plan by powerful mayor Sergei Sobyanin for four such roads -- says that "no radioactive contamination has been found at the site." - Moscow 'is not Pripyat' - The new road, named the South-East Expressway, will connect ten outlying neighbourhoods bypassing the congested city centre.
 It will skirt the radioactive site next to the Moscow Polymetals Plant, formerly a top-secret facility that produced the radioactive element thorium for nuclear reactors until the 1970s.
 Working in the era before the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster when radiation risks were underestimated, the plant simply dumped waste in its backyard, on the slope descending to the Moskva River.
 Its land with unmarked radioactive spots was eventually transferred to the city of 12 million, whose mayor is keen to redevelop post-industrial wasteland.
 "We are extremely concerned that construction workers will disturb this radioactive burial site," says activist Ivan Kondratyev whose father lives nearby.

Anyone who’s stopped into a truck stop or visited a fraternal lodge lately has probably seen video gaming machines in use. These “grey” gambling devices are not authorized by state law and no money from their use flows to the state. My SB 566 would eliminate these illegal devices and allow the Missouri State Lottery to license and regulate video gaming machines, thus ensuring that our local schools benefit from the revenues. Similarly, SB 567 brings sports wagering out of the shadows and provides for state regulation. There are several sports betting bills before the General Assembly this year, all of which allow our existing casinos to develop online platforms for placing wagers. My legislation differs in that it also allows the Missouri Lottery to sell parlay games based on sporting events. According to the fiscal note prepared for my bill, the expected revenue of lottery parlay games far exceeds the income expected from casino-based sports wagering.

Sea water injections pumps and sea water lift pumps are two major kinds of pumps used in different types of applications. Seawater injection pumps are installed at offshore platforms and are generally centrifugal pumps, which are used to increase the pressure of the reservoir by injecting high pressure raw sea water. On the other hand, seawater lift pumps are used to lift the sea water on board so as to use that water for different applications on the vessel. These pumps are vertical, centrifugal or multistage pumps and are attached to a submersible motor. Sea water injection pumps and sea water lift pumps both required a necessary consideration of material at the time of manufacturing in order to protect them from corrosion and rusting.

One year ago: A late winter storm brought blizzards, floods and a tornado across more than 25 states from the northern Rocky Mountains to Texas and beyond. A federal judge in Washington increased to a total of seven and a-half years the prison sentence for former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort for misleading the government about his foreign lobbying work; Manafort was also hit with fresh state charges in New York accusing him of giving false information on mortgage loan applications. (A state judge later threw out those charges.) Cardinal George Pell, the most senior Catholic to be convicted of child sex abuse, was sentenced in Australia to six years in prison for molesting two choirboys in an Australian cathedral. California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed an executive order granting reprieves to all 737 condemned inmates on the nation's largest death row, putting a moratorium on executions during his term as governor.
