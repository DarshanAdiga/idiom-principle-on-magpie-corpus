She said home values have remained strong, the town is ahead of budget by $58,000 in property tax collection and $50,000 in business license tax collection, and it’s saving money by means of reduced expenditures. Krens also pointed out the town experienced only a 6-percent reduction in sales tax revenue in April.

There was no way Comrade Oshiomhole was not going to have a dialectical roforofo with entrenched machiavellian and mephistophelian political forces given his Oto Von Bismarck determination to stamp democratic authority in the running of party affairs and thus wean it from the asphyxiating and expansionist ozone of entrenched forces. We ought to understand that remaining as party chairman is not dependent on his good performance alone. It also depends humongously on how other stakeholders are willing to drop their egoistic and megalomaniacal habiliments for the greater interest of the party and the nation but a majority of the governors, (certainly not all of them) on their part, in my opinion, have become the greatest impedimenta since 1999, to any democratic consolidation in the land. Once elected, they assume the powers of an emperor, deciding who can become anything in their states.

When Joe Biden told a radio host in May that "you ain't Black" if you can't figure out whether to support him or Trump for president — a remark the Democrat quickly apologized for —it drew an unusually personal response from Faulkner. She publicly said that Biden's statement was hurtful.


  "It especially hit home to me because I am in a biracial community in my home," she said, "and talking about somebody's blackness based on how they think or how they look is insulting. And it keeps us back as people of color."


  Trump retweeted her statement about Biden, adding that she was "a great American."


  One moment from "Outnumbered" last year became fodder for discussion on Martin's show. Jessica Tarlov, usually the lone Democrat on "Outnumbered" was listing racist incidents involving Trump when Faulkner interrupted with a plea for civility. It led to questions about whether she's as hard on Trump on the topic of race as she was on Biden.


  Tarlov, in an interview, said she did not think Faulkner cut her off or that it should be viewed that she was protecting Trump. "We're all human and things hit us in certain ways," she said.


  Faulkner recalled being tough on the air about how Trump initially responded to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico in 2017.


  It's in that moment," she said. "I can't speak to every single moment, but when it hits me, I'm as hard as can be."


  Tarlov said she had no idea who Faulkner supported for president in 2016, despite working with her for three years.


  Asked whether she supported Trump, Faulkner said people can think whatever they want. "I don't discuss how I vote with anybody," she said. "I'm a journalist. We shouldn't do that. Some do. But I'm not proselytizing any particular point of view, faith or otherwise, and if they want to think what they think, go right ahead."


  She added, "I challenge anybody to guess where I'm coming from. And, in fact, if they have answers, can they tell me?"


  When Faulkner teamed with Bill Hemmer in the spring for a coronavirus town hall with Trump, they were criticized for going soft. But that wasn't the case when Faulkner sat down with Trump in June during the protests following Floyd's death.


  When Trump appeared to question some of Abraham Lincoln's achievements, Faulkner responded, "Well, we are free, Mr. President."


  And when she asked about Trump's tweeting, "when the looting starts, the shooting starts," Faulkner came prepared with an explanation of where the phrase originated and why many found it disturbing.


  That showed the importance of having an African American journalist with presence do the interview, Martin said.


  "Guess what?" he said. "Maria Bartiromo wouldn't have done that. Sean Hannity wouldn't have done that. Laura Ingraham wouldn't have done that."


  Bill Grueskin, a Columbia University journalism professor, praised Faulkner in Columbia Journalism Review. He wrote that "she was neither antagonistic nor admiring. She put herself into the interview, framed in her roles as a Black woman and parent, in a way that journalists rarely do with her skill and care."


  While you could argue that Faulkner could have pressed harder on some questions, "Trump usually gets more defensive," Grueskin wrote. "Faulkner's methodical approach has its own power."


  Faulkner said her role is not to play "gotcha," but to listen to the president's answers and follow up.


  "It doesn't bother me that people assume," she said. "But it is an opportunity to show them. You don't know until you watch and listen."

Kattar’s mug had been splashed on ESPN all week, promoting his fight at “Fight Island,” the name for the resort location, Yas Island, which is home to a UFC four-night extravaganza over two weeks.
 “It was nice to see,” said Kattar, 32, on the TV and social media exposure he got leading up to the fight. “It’s good feedback and shows that what myself and my team are doing is working.”
 Kattar’s story borders on remarkable.
 He retired as a fighter in mixed martial arts just over seven years ago, at age 25, due to his inability to move up in the ranks to the big-time, UFC. Instead he became a successful promoter in New England on the CombatZone, a “minor league” proving grounds.
 Kattar decided to get back into the sport, as a competitor, three years later. After two quick wins in 2016, he again was being overlooked.
 But then a bout opened up, due to injury, in a big UFC event in Anaheim, 10 months after his last fight.
 He took it, realizing it could be his last and only shot at that level.
 Not only did Kattar shock Andre Fili, via decision, but his energetic, aggressive style won over the UFC President Dana White.
 Kattar has been a regular since, with three bouts in 2018, two last year and already two in 2020. He signed a six-fight contract with the UFC last month.
 Basically, Kattar has arrived.
 “A year ago, I was hoping for the opportunity to crack the top ten,” said Kattar. “Now I’m working on the fastest path to a title shot. This is what I set out for when I decided to come back ... to be in this position.”

Township still concerned about compost operation
   
 BATAVIA TOWNSHIP -- Residents around a M-86/Hodunk Road compost dump site hope to convince state officials the operation needs to be closed.
   
 Batavia Township Trustee Michael Crenshaw said "our biggest hope is we can take it outside the Right to Farm Act exemption, then it would be a commercial operation and subject to township zoning."
   
 Since last November Cornelius Farms has removed waste from the Mastronardi greenhouses and put it on the fields on the 43-acres it purchased. The long piles of plant materials includes plastics used in the hydroponic grow operation from the two greenhouses that cover nearly 80 acres.
   
 While the materials are organic, an inspection by the Department of Natural Resources found the refuse contains non-biodegradable plastic, especially plastic rings and netting used at Maroa Farms tomato operation and those from the adjacent Pepperco farm.
   
 The Mastronardi contract for removal is with Greener Organics which then subcontracts with Cornelius.
   
 Crenshaw, who lives next to the operation on the Batavia/Coldwater Township border, said "the odor is not pleasant." He contacted Cornelius last year who promised the materials would be disced into the ground. "They haven't been."
   
 The trustee contacted Aaron Hiday, compost supervisor for the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy. State law requires permitting for non-farm operations and limits the amount on a site to 5,000 cubic feet according to state statues.
   
 Hiday inspected the site but has yet to file any action. Measurements were taken of the piles.
   
 Crenshaw said of Cornelius "we know he is up to about 7,000 cubic yard threshold. They are brining in more trucks almost everyday."
   
 "I don't know why EGLE doesn't just close him down. All those bits of plastic in there are not biodegradable. That stuff will last forever. You can't compost that stuff," Crenshaw said.
   
 Crenshaw said this amount may require the operation to apply for a commercial compost operation permit. "If he does then we may be able to act. This land is zoned agriculture."
   
 "The big kicker is the right to farm act preempts any of our local zoning," the trustee said.
   
 The Michigan Right to Farm Act was enacted in 1981 to provide farmers with nuisance protection. This state law authorizes the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development to develop and adopt Generally Accepted Agricultural and Management Practices, known as GAAMPs, for farms and farm operations in Michigan.
   
 Crenshaw has contacted MIDARD and asked them about the operation.
   
 The problem is not new. Last fall Paw Paw Township sought an injunction against the Cornelius Van Buren County operation. In the suit it stated Cornelius began dumping, storing, and stockpiling Mastronardi organic materials from off site to the 15.8 acre site there in 2019.
   
 After a report by MDARD was presented to Van Buren Probate Judge David Distefano he dismissed the suit by Paw Paw Township. "An injunction would be unnecessary in light of defendants Right to Farm Act Compliance."
   
 The judge ruled the township could still seek action if Cornelius fails to comply with GAAMP standards or violates other ordinances.
   
 Crenshaw is trying to get MIDARD to review the Branch County operation.
   
 "The wheels on this bus of state government is turning slowly with people out on furlough and out of their offices due to COVID," the trustee said.
   
 "I hope maybe a citizens group would take this up with Mastronardi, Crenshaw suggested.
   
 Notices have been sent by DNR after questions arose about possible water contamination on the site.
   
 Branch County Memorial Airport Manager Joe Best sent a notice because the site was attracting crows last winter. It is illegal to have a nuisance which attracts birds to within 10,000 of a runway. Those birds were gone this spring as food sources grew.
   
 If Crenshaw can get all the information together from the various state agencies, he will ask the township board to consult an attorney to take action.
   
 "Maybe if we can get people talking about it maybe then the Sunset Brand (Mastronardi) would listen and take some action," he told the July township zoning commission meeting.

If someone needs help on Pleasure Island, Janeen Williams is usually the first to offer a hand, according to friend, Debra LeCompte.
   
 In fact, the two women first met 10 years ago when they worked together on a fundraiser for an island resident.
   
 "She's there in a heartbeat," LeCompte said. "She's loved by a lot of people here."
   
 That was evident soon after LaCompte started a fundraiser to help Williams, owner of the Majik Beanz Espresso coffee shop on Lake Park Blvd in Carolina Beach.
   
 Williams has been hospitalized due to complications from COVID-19 and had to close the shop as a result. But, as LaCompte noted on the GoFundMe page, that doesn't stop the bills.

 Castle Hayne restaurant closing indefinitely
   
 Porches Cafe in the River Bluffs community of Castle Hayne will soon be serving its last meal for a while. Earlier this week, the restaurant announced they will close after dinner service on Friday for the foreseeable future, due to the impact that the pandemic has had on the restaurant industry.
   
 John Lennon, director of operations for the community, said Porches was implementing staff changes when Phase 1 restrictions fell into place in an effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus. A new chef had just started when they had to close in March.
   
 "We tried to maintain a carryout business and we were excited about Phase 2," he said. "But then we saw a dramatic decrease in the interest in going out to eat."
   
 But, that doesn't mean the end of Porches.
   
 "That's why I say indefinitely," he said. "Reopening will be a part of a future discussion. I don't think there's anyone who doesn't want that."
   
 The post on social media encouraged diners to come every day this week for a different special, such as vegetarian fare on Thursday. Look for seafood and dinner specials to be announced on Friday.

 Temporary closure for River Lights restaurant
   
 Another local community is also facing restaurant closure, but hopeful for only a short time. Magnolia Social Cafe posted that this will be their last week in business until further notice. The owner is scheduled for surgery and will have to close during recovery, due to a limited staff because of COVID-19.
   
 The post, though, said they will reopen as soon as possible.

This is even more so as Monguno, in his high position, very much knows that what our military is fighting is no longer the Boko Haram that took up arms against the Nigerian state eleven years ago, but some foreign powers bent in destroying Nigeria to advance the politics of francophone against anglophone countries. Stories abound of helicopters dropping sophisticated arms for the terrorists in the forests of the northeast. Why didn’t Monguno raise a matter of urgent public importance to draw attention to the fact that a neighboring francophone country has for years been giving sanctuary to Boko Haram terrorists, to make sure our armed forces do not reach them and once and for all finish off the war?

But the analysis does not end there. Managements can choose to depreciate overproduction using a conservative well reserve figure or a very aggressive figure. The choice to capitalize or expense ongoing activities is made based upon whether management determines the items in question are significantly worth it (tax code definition) or will last long enough that capitalization is needed. Therefore, even though a company may use the same overall system, other choices may result in more depreciation of what was an overvalued asset. There are many potential areas where one management may capitalize an item while another would expense it because the benefits "are just not worth it."


  Therefore, an overpayment of an acquisition can be overcome over time with conservative accounting assumptions regarding depreciation and expense classification going forward.


  Another area to look at is that Exxon Mobil is integrated. One subsidiary may have signed contracts with another subsidiary that are long term to justify the book valuation. A smaller company subject to current market conditions may not be able to escape a lower asset valuation in this fashion because they sell "to the market."


  The last and probably most important view is whether or not the assets will recover in the future to deliver much better profits and cash flow. This is a very subjective part of the evaluation process. But usually the views of management prevail.


  Those who are demanding impairments appear to overlook the financial strength rating of the company and the long history of delivering profits. The last few years have not been pleasant for the industry in general. But that does not make management automatically incorrect about predicting a better and more profitable future.


  ## The Game


  As this game to impair is generally played, the maximum benefits appear to come from an overly conservative impairment resulting in a correspondingly big charge to "clear the decks." This then allows management to report some very nice profits in future fiscal years.

To defeat the terrorists who collectively are the enemies of each and everyone of us, we have to learn from the example of the respected Senator Ameh Ebute, former President of the Senate of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. He recently wrote a letter commending the Nigerian Army and hailing them for all that they have achieved on our collective behalf. He did not play to the gallery by engaging in sabre-rattling or merely following the crowd. He believes the military is our institution of national pride, and that those manning it are not spirits.

Kattar really got his start into mixed martial arts back in high school, as one of the top wrestlers at Methuen High.
 “I always loved competing and battling,” said Kattar. “I love all sports, but this sport is made for me.”
 Kattar’s growth over the last year, he believes, coincides with his ability to form a team, which includes top-notch training.
 He’s got what he believes are two elite head coaches in Carlos Nepo of Somerville and Tyson Chartier of Auburn, N.H. with best friend and teammate Rob Font, another UFC up-and-comer by his side for daily work on the mats.
 “I have the best people around me, motivating me, sort of like the Patriots with owner Bob Kraft, Bill Belichick and Tom Brady,” said Kattar. “I feel like I’m just scratching the surface. The [championship] belt is in my sight.”
 The toughest aspect of his two recent wins has been the fact that family and friends haven’t been allowed to watch due to COVID-19 restrictions.
 Kattar has a huge following in the Merrimack Valley. And they apparently travel.
 “If my family and friends were allowed to come, they would’ve made the trip to Fight Island,” said Kattar. “I love having my people with me, rooting me on. It inspires. I miss them not being there. But I have a job to do, and that’s where my focus is.”
 After the bout, Ige, Kattar’s opponent, gave him a compliment for the ages, at least considering how far he has come.
 “[Calvin is] one of the best in the world, man,” said Ige. “He’s super slick.”
 Kattar flew to Las Vegas yesterday, where he’ll remain for the weekend. Then he’ll head home to Haverhill on Monday, rehab some minor injuries and soon begin strength and conditioning while awaiting word of his next bout.
 “I have a few places l love to go to when I’m home, Ralphies in Salem, N.H. for chicken parm and J. Brian’s in Lawrence for Buffalo wings,” said Kattar. “Of course, my mom’s chicken parm will be the first thing I have. And then it’s back to work.”

Most of the focus will be on Harper, whose 2019 campaign was regarded as subpar despite putting up terrific numbers. He hit .260/.372/.510 with 35 home runs, 114 RBI, 98 runs scored, and 15 stolen bases over 682 plate appearances. But the expectations for the $330 million man are sky-high. Meanwhile, Hoskins and Segura are coming off of seasons in which they didn't quite live up to expectations, either. On paper, this is an offense that has the potential to be among the league's best and they will need it to be in order to gain traction in the mighty NL East.

It's a different world, Woods keeps saying.


  It was a reasonable return.


  "Got off to almost an ideal start and got a feel for the round early," Woods said. "I just didn't make anything today. I had looks at birdies, but I really didn't make much."


  He left that to Finau, who seemed to make everything. Finau finished with seven birdies over his last 10 holes on a Muirfield Village course that was faster and tougher than last week in the Workday Charity Open. That gave him a one-shot lead over Ryan Palmer.


  The greens are being replaced after the Memorial, so there's no concern about them dying out. They were 2 feet faster on the Stimpmeter, the wind was strong and often changed direction without notice. That showed in the scoring. Only seven players broke 70, compared with 35 rounds in the 60s for the first round last week.


  This is the first itme in 63 years the PGA Tour has played consecutive weeks on the same course.


  Muirfield Village only looked like the same course.


  "It's night and day," Palmer said. "The greens, they're 2, 3 feet faster for sure. So I knew it wasn't a course you had to just go out and light up."


  It wasn't a course to overpower, either.


  Bryson DeChambeau hit one drive 423 yards with the wind at his back, leaving him 46 yards to the pin on No. 1, a hole where he recalls hitting 5-iron in the past. That was a rare birdie. With wedges in his hand, he still managed only a 73.

Joining the fray this time is Scarlett Johannson, so wonderful in films like _Lost in Translation_ and _Match Point_ yet so incredibly miscast here as a woman with a commanding presence. Although she is indeed beautiful and often talented, Johannson plays The Black Widow, superspy extraordinaire here, yet at no point feels like a powerful figure even when her mousey façade is stripped away (perhaps giving her a bit of a Russian accent when she’s playing “herself” could have helped). This isn’t helped by Favreau’s handling of her unmasking, which is offhanded to the point of forgetfulness, like it somehow slipped his mind that she’s kind of a big deal. Alas, nothing about the Black Widow seems terribly well-conceived, even her fighting style – which I have dubbed “Impractical Fu” – which consists almost entirely of wrapping her milky thighs around a man’s neck and twirling furiously. Not a bad way to go… but not convincing either, and when The Black Widow finally lets loose we’re far more impressed by Johannson’s stunt double than by the actress herself.

But where Justin Theroux’s screenplay fails is in the act of bringing Tony up again from his lowest ebb. The second half of the film is awkwardly paced and mistakes soul-searching for a simple scavenger hunt, and confuses building character with building a very large laser of some kind. None of this is aided by the inexplicable decision to alleviate from Tony Stark many of the physical symptoms of his condition just when the film needed them most, leaving a film about high-tech uppercuts that doesn’t always pack a punch. A large portion of _Iron Man 2_ sacrifices drama for convenience, and the “ticking clock” plotline on which the entire movie is based takes a backseat to science-y montages and bizarre pronouncements like, “You can unlock the secret of your own heart.” That the perpetually glib Tony Stark manages to accept that statement without so much as cocked eyebrow feels out of character at best, and at worst… a little pathetic.

I was grumbling about someone the other day.
 That's not unusual for me.
 Not that I'm a chronic grumbler but if I feel that I have been wronged I'm not above grumbling about the person who put me in a grumbling frame of mind.
 I don't seek grumbling out but I don't run from grumbling, either.
 And my grumbling isn't terribly involved.
 I don't wish anything bad on the subject of my grumbling.
 Well, if I occasionally do, it's only because I realize that my grumbling can never actually harm anyone.
 If my bad-tidings grumbling was actually harmful, I would not do it.
 This was not the first time I found myself grumbling about this particular person.
 That's not unusual either. I'm accustomed to repetitive grumbling.
 Some people just bring out the grumbling in others.
 It's probably genetic.
 To be fair, while there are people who are able to bring out grumbling in others with greater facility than the rest of us there are others who are prone to grumbling with far less provocation than regular folk.
 Not that I'm one of those latter people. I feel my grumbling comes in the proper proportion after valid instigation.
 So, this particular grumbling episode of mine seemed to be routine.
 It entailed talking to myself, listing the areas in which the object of my grumbling had led me to this state of being.
 I talk to myself when I grumble.
 Grumbling silently, utilizing an internal monologue, just doesn't work as well as grumbling audibly.
 I don't know why this is the case but it's better if I can actually hear myself grumble.
 It's not that I'm seeking a reply or a debate.
 Au contraire.
 Grumbling is best done when you're alone precisely because you don't want a reply or a debate.
 Such an interjection might convince you that your grumbling is unjustified, that you're being petty, stupid or something else equally improbable.
 Who needs that?
 At any rate, what struck me about this particular grumbling session was that I had never actually met the person I was grumbling about.
 Even though I've grumbled repeatedly about this person, we've never conversed, never exchanged emails, or text messages.
 I don't even know what this grumbling catalyst looks like.
 How could this be, a reasonable person might inquire?
 Technology, of course, is to blame.
 Never in human history has it been possible for so many people to interact and perform cooperative tasks without simultaneously occupying the same room, building, municipality, state, or nation.
 What's interesting about this, what's worthy of scientific study, is the fact that people are now able to irritate each other without actually knowing each other.
 Someone could inquire to someone caught up in this phenomenon, "Hey, do you know John Q. Citizen?"
 And that person caught up in this phenomenon might respond, "Huh?"
 The person making the inquiry could then explain that John Q. Citizen is the person they interact with remotely on various tasks without ever having actually met.
 And then, once that person caught up in this phenomenon recognized who was being discussed, he would be prompted to say without reservation, "He's a jerk."
 That's my observation.
 That even though these mythical people have never face-to-face interacted, have never conversed, and don't even know what the other looks like they've managed to annoy each other to the point of grumbling.
 It's a tribute to the human spirit.

It is only when we try it that we will know whether we are ripe for it. When you try something for the first time, you will have teething problems. For instance, we have been holding zoom court sessions but because of the state of our infrastructure in Nigeria, sometimes the thing will break off or the voice will be muffled. We can’t say it is not worth trying because of this problem. We now do bank transactions online. We know that there are some elements whose job in life is to look for how to cheat the system. But we can’t because of the risk of that say electronic banking is bad. We can also set up electronic voting the way the banks have done their own. It will help us do things the right way. Look at what happened during the last election in Lagos State where thugs scattered the process in one local government because they said the powers that be in the state were afraid they will lose the election there based on the ethnic configuration there. If we were voting electronically from our homes, that will not happen; we should not be afraid of relying on technology because at the end of the day, it delivers better than human beings can.

When I think of Granmom, the first thought that pops into mind, aside from the fact she had the same hairstyle for at least 39 years of my life, was she loved to sing and make a joyful noise as an alto in a choir or during a four- part harmony singing.


  She’d try soprano once but would find a note she couldn’t reach and drop back down. I’d love to see her face light up singing “I’ll Fly Away,” “On The Jericho Road” and “Have a Little Talk with Jesus” as her sister Robbie Jean tickled the ivories on that old standup piano.

“This country was founded on the premise of individual rights,” Armando Escalante said. “To mandate masks ... is a form of communism, a form of collectivism.”


  The resolution, as drafted, does not require anyone to wear a mask, and there are no penalties for refusing to comply.


  “This resolution — it does say that we in DeBary are concerned,” Mayor Karen Chasez said.


  The non-binding measure, similar to one in effect in Deltona, was approved on a 4-1 vote. Vice Mayor Erika Benfield was the dissenter. Benfield warned the pressure to don a mask is “a slippery slope” and “government overreach.”


  Council Member Patricia Stevenson advocated stronger action by the elected body, noting she sees grassroots support for requiring masks inside stores and offices.


  “The major of the emails I received were in favor of a mask mandate,” Stevenson said. “The problem I have is when your liberty infringes on my liberty. ... Masks need to be universally mandated.”

CARVER - School officials are working on a re-entry plan to prepare for an in- person return to school while meeting health and safety requirements, remote learning in two parts and a hybrid of the two.
 Superintendent Scott Knief said in a presentation to the School Committee last week that the state Department of Elementary and Secondary Education wants school districts to submit one formal plan by July 31.
 "We're always adjusting to new information," he said, as he shared an outline of a reopening plan that he has also shared with the faculty of both Carver schools and also at a parent meeting attended by as many as 130 parents.
 He said so many parents wanted to be part of the process that he established a parent advisory subcommittee to meet on a weekly basis.
 The School Committee has committed to meeting at 7 p.m. Wednesday, July 29, through remote participation via Zoom to focus on reviewing the final re-entry plan to be presented to the state and making any final suggestions that could result in changes.
 Parents recently answered a survey about having their students return to school with health and safety requirements in place. He said he was not surprised by the results.
 Knief said of the 628 total responses, 68 percent said their students would return in the fall, 5 percent said no and 27 percent said they were unsure with not enough information or they don't know where they will be in six weeks.
 Eighty percent responded that they do not have health concerns in their family that would keep their students at home, and of the 20 percent who do, some would still send their students back.
 As for the hybrid option, Knief said one option is students returning to school half days every day, alternating days, two days in-person and three days remotely and then alternating weeks. He said half days every day was a first choice but ranked lower for another option.
 School Committee member Jenn Pratt said that as a parent she would prefer alternating weeks and knows teachers who also prefer that to half days based on the amount of quality teaching time balanced against maintaining sanitary conditions. Knief said it will be a priority to keep students in the same family on the same schedule.
 Knief expects to ask parents to a respond to a few more surveys, with the final survey asking parents to formally commit to sending their students back to school or providing them with a remote learning opportunity.
 "Right now we're thinking that this kind of model would be some sort of an online learning platform," he said.
 School Committee member Jason Greenwood was concerned about how the district will reach out to parents about the reopening plan. Knief said he hopes to schedule public hearing-type meetings for that purpose.
 Both schools will be required to have isolation rooms for students or staff with possible COVID-19 symptoms that are separate from the nurse's offices but that school nurses can access using the appropriate personal protective equipment.
 Knief said Carver Elementary has the available space and a new state-of-the- art ventilation system, but that's not the case at Carver Middle High School.
 School Committee member James O'Brien said not enough consideration is being given to the difficulties of talking with a mask on all day and he would support face shields as an option. He also worries about how students will catch up academically among the other challenges.
 "There are a lot of people really having a hard time with this," he said.
 One of the recommendations is that students eat in their classrooms. Knief said yes when School Committee Chairman Andy Cardarelli asked about opening windows and holding classes outdoors weather permitting as plausible options.
 Knief said efforts are underway to be able to meet social distancing requirements of at least three feet apart and all students facing forward, including purchasing new desks for kindergarten and first grade rather than sharing tables.
 He said that cost of the new desks and the remote learning platform for students who do not return to school may be covered by new funding announced by Gov. Charlie Baker. He said school districts will receive an additional $225 per pupil. He said that would mean approximately $360,000 for Carver.

TAIPEI, July 17 (Reuters) - Fighting erupted inside and outside of Taiwan's parliament again on Friday over the disputed nomination by President Tsai Ing- wen of a senior aide to a top government watchdog post, which the main opposition party has labelled cronyism.


  The Kuomintang (KMT) has mounted a noisy campaign against the nomination of Chen Chu to head the Control Yuan, an independent government watchdog.


  The KMT, soundly beaten by Tsai and her Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in elections in January, this week occupied parliament's main chamber for three days, trying to thwart Chen from taking the post.


  Several KMT lawmakers knocked down voting booths inside the chamber to block DPP legislators from casting ballots over the nomination. KMT has accused the DPP of cheating in part of the vote on nomination this week.


  The voting on Friday went ahead despite shouting and protests from KMT lawmakers, who held banners reading "invalid vote".


  About 100 KMT supporters outside parliament fought with police and some tried to break through barricades, calling on the DPP to withdraw the nomination.


  "Rejection to cronyism. Withdraw the nomination," KMT Chairman Johnny Chiang told supporters on the back of a truck outside the parliament.


  Taiwan is a boisterous, sometimes unruly democracy. Punch-throwing and rowdy protests are not uncommon in parliament.


  The DPP has a large parliamentary majority, and has been angered by the targeting of Chen, who was jailed in 1980 for helping lead pro-democracy demonstrations against the then-KMT government when Taiwan was a dictatorship.


  The KMT, under its youthful new leader, Chiang, has been trying to reinvent itself since its election defeat, having failed to shake off DPP accusations they were too pro-China.


  The party traditionally favours closer ties with China, which claims Taiwan as its own territory.


  The KMT faces a further challenge next month in a mayoral by-election in the major southern metropolis of Kaohsiung, traditionally a DPP stronghold.


  Kaohsiung's previous KMT mayor was thrown out of office in a recall vote in June. (Reporting by Yimou Lee and Ann Wang; Additional reporting by Ben Blanchard. Editing by Gerry Doyle)

I have argued in a recent television interview on AIT that the entire budget of the Nigerian military is only a fraction of that of the New York Fire Service. At 38.9 billion dollars, this year’s budget of the University of California is far more than our entire national budget. The New York Police has eight operational helicopters, but the Nigerian police has only two. Yet, issues like that, which anyone in his senses knows will affect our ability to effective fight crime and criminalistics, are hardly of interest to some of our legislators obviously because it does not fall in line with the more appealing narrative to simply follow the crowd and condemn our security services.

Pennsylvania reported an increase of 16 new COVID-19 deaths Thursday, bringing the statewide total to 6,973.
 Earlier in the week Philadelphia teachers endorsed a hybrid model for school reopening, which would have students complete a mix of remote learning and in- school instruction. When asked about it Thursday, Rivera said hybrid models would be the safest reopening policy.
 “When we look at the public health perspective, maintaining social distancing is the best practice for public health,” he said. “We know at the same time some form of in-person instruction is the most effective instruction for students.”
 On Tuesday Shanksville-Stonycreek School District officials revised their reopening plans to add face coverings for students, staff and visitors in the school. Superintendent Sam Romesberg, in a phone call that same day, said he’s not in favor of a hybrid plan for the district.
 “We’re not in favor of that on-off schedule because we don’t know how parents are going to find child care in this rural area on those days the students are home,” he said. He later added, “Being the size we are, we really feel we can meet the CDC requirements acceptably with our kids coming every day. But we will be prepared regardless of what the state throws at us.”
 During his press conference Wednesday, Wolf said that he would “pull the plug” and close school district buildings again if the number of COVID-19 cases increase greatly before the start of the 2020-21 school year.
 “If I don’t feel it’s not safe to go back, they are not going to go back,” he said.
 Officials on Thursday, however, said they are continuing to push for all school buildings to be up and running in the fall.
 “One of the things we’ve heard from students is that they are anxious to get back to school,” Levine said. “But they also know that the actions we take now will determine what school will look like for them.”

Adds refrigerated trailers ordered for emergency morgue space; latest case and death tallies)


  By Rich McKay and Gabriella Borter


  ATLANTA, July 16 (Reuters) - Colorado and Arkansas on Thursday joined a growing list of U.S. states requiring face coverings in public to combat a surge in coronavirus infections, after Georgia's governor moved the other way and barred such measures from being imposed at the local level.


  The conflicting directives over masks came as the United States reported at least 77,000 new COVID-19 cases nationwide on Thursday, a record daily jump in known infections for the seventh time this month, according to a Reuters tally.


  Texas alone accounted for one in five of the newly reported cases. The rising numbers bore grim consequences for public health authorities on the ground.


  Facing a looming shortage of morgue capacity in hard-hit areas around Phoenix, Arizona, and San Antonio, Texas, officials said they were bringing in coolers and refrigerated trailers to store bodies of COVID-19 victims.


  With announcements from Colorado Governor Jared Polis, a Democrat, and Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson, a Republican, a majority of states - 26 out of 50 - have now sided with health experts urging that face masks be mandatory, rather than a matter of personal choice.


  Bucking the trend, Georgia's Republican governor, Brian Kemp, issued an executive order late on Wednesday suspending local face-mask regulations while saying residents were "strongly encouraged" to wear them.


  Kemp, one of the first governors to ease statewide stay-at-home orders and business closures following the early stages of the U.S. outbreak, suggested that mandating masks would be too restrictive.


  After Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms of Atlanta, Georgia's capital and largest city, said she planned to defy Kemp's order and enforce a mandatory mask ordinance she issued on July 8, Kemp filed suit on Thursday to override her.


  "This lawsuit is on behalf of the Atlanta business owners and their hardworking employees who are struggling to survive during these difficult times," Kemp said in a statement. "I refuse to sit back and watch as disastrous policies threaten the lives and livelihoods of our citizens."


  Hours earlier, Bottoms, who tested positive for the virus herself last week and is under quarantine, declared the city's mask requirements "enforceable as they stand."


  Savannah Mayor Van Johnson, who issued a mask mandate in his Georgia city on July 1, said on Twitter that Kemp's order demonstrated he "does not give a damn about us."


  The clash drew mixed reactions from residents.


  'CHOOSE WISELY'


  "We need to wear masks to stop the spread," said Ethan Padgett, 37, a furloughed art museum worker, as he spoke through his face covering outside an East Atlanta Village coffee shop. "If the governor takes it more seriously, people will."


  But Pat Walker, 54, who was also wearing a mask, said the governor was just encouraging people to do the right thing.


  "People should have a choice but choose wisely," she said.


  Mounting evidence of a worsening pandemic sparked a reckoning that has cut across partisan lines on a heavily politicized issue.


  "The number of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths are numbers that speak for themselves and indicate that we need to do more," Hutchinson told a news briefing.


  Starting Monday in Arkansas, individuals must wear face-coverings in all indoor or outdoor settings where they are exposed to non-household members and where social distancing of 6 feet or more is not possible.


  Colorado's order requires people to cover their noses and mouths in such indoor settings as office spaces and stores, as well as while congregating outside to wait for taxis, buses, ride-shares or other transport services.


  Ohio Governor Mike DeWine, also a Republican, widened his directive to include more circumstances where face masks are obligatory.


  SIGNS OF RESURGENT VIRUS


  As of late Thursday, the novel coronavirus was known to have infected nearly 3.6 million Americans and killed more than 138,000.


  The resurgence is especially worrisome across the American South and West where officials started loosening economic and social restrictions aimed at slowing the spread of the virus.


  On Thursday, Florida, Texas and South Carolina each reported record numbers of COVID-19 deaths for a single day. At least four others hit an all-time high in new infections, led by Texas with more than 15,000 for the day.


  Thirty states have registered record daily increases in confirmed cases this month, and 14 states have reported a greater number of deaths for a single day in July than ever before.


  Moreover, the proportion of positive test results among individuals being screened for infection - a metric called the positivity rate - has been trending ominously higher across much of the county.


  Infectious disease experts consider a rate higher than 5% concerning, and two dozen states have averaged rates above 5% and climbing over the past two weeks, according to data collected by Johns Hopkins University.


  Many states have had to roll back reopenings aimed at pumping up local economies crushed by the coronavirus shutdowns.


  New York City, once the country's epicenter, has been slower than others to reopen and continues to see results, Mayor Bill de Blasio told a briefing on Thursday.


  Only 2% of more than 40,000 city residents screened for infection tested positive on Wednesday, he said, against a national average of 8.8%, rising to more than 20% in some states.

And what customers are awarded volumes at, I would say it was more competitive in the first-half of the quarter versus the second-half of the quarter. And we’ve seen customers across our segments come back with more mini bid, and bids that weren’t getting implemented or carriers weren’t taking the volumes that were awarded. Those are coming back out in mini bids from a tighter capacity environment, really across the board in general. I would say we’ve seen some larger brokers, I think, defend their position, much like we would as well. So I don’t think that anybody was ill behaved in the market. But I do think it’s been a more competitive price environment from large incumbents and then from a digital freight perspective, I think that there’s not a lot of change there. There’s always been an aggressive mentality from a price perspective, with customers, but I don’t think anything is different.

Bloomberg) -- Follow Bloomberg on LINE messenger for all the business news and analysis you need.


  The biggest economic uncertainty Singapore faces is something it can’t control -- global demand for its goods and services -- and in that case, additional government stimulus may not be the best remedy, according to the city-state’s trade minister.


  “The greatest uncertainty and the downside risks at this point in time is the global external demand, and I don’t think fiscal measures alone will be the most appropriate for this kind of challenge,” Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing said Wednesday in an interview with Bloomberg TV’s Haslinda Amin.


  Chan’s comments come as the city-state’s economy plunged into recession in the second quarter amid “circuit-breaker” restrictions to control the spread of the coronavirus. Gross domestic product declined an annualized 41.2% from the previous three months, the biggest quarterly contraction on record, data Tuesday showed. The contraction in demand caused by the circuit breaker was within expectations and “within our control,” according to Chan, though external demand is more uncertain.


  The government is “very concerned that there will be a second wave, if not a third wave or recurring waves of infection across the world, which will cause the demand from these economies to further shrink,” he said. Around the region, some countries are seeing a resurgence in virus cases after lockdowns eased.


  In light of this, it’s a “bit difficult for us to say when the upturn will come about,” but Singapore must position itself as a “safe harbor” for investment and talent, maintain trade links with all major economies and diversify its markets and sources of materials, Chan said.


  “If we do all this well, then I think we are well poised for the recovery,” he said.


  New Models


  Singapore’s government has pledged about S$93 billion ($67 billion), or nearly 20% of GDP, in stimulus to shore up troubled businesses and households and prevent a surge in retrenchments.


  Chan said the government must help some industries rethink their business models for a post-pandemic world, singling out tourism, aviation, and conference and exhibition sectors as industries that need to adapt their core strategies.


  “It’s not just waiting for demand to pick up again as for some sectors, where the business models are still relevant. There are also sectors where we will need to develop new business models,” he said.


  One of the senior ministers in Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong’s government, Chan said he sees change coming to the cabinet after the July 10 elections. The ruling People’s Action Party maintained a commanding majority in parliament with 89% of seats, though that was its worst-ever performance. The party garnered 61.2% of the popular vote, lower than the last election in 2015 and only slightly more than its all-time low in 2011.


  Post-Election Changes


  Given that some ministers have retired, changes to the cabinet can be expected, though that’s for the prime minister to decide, according to Chan.


  “We have from the onset said that this will be a tough election, because many businesses are suffering, many workers are suffering and the uncertainties of the future are enormous,” Chan said.


  The PAP will work with the opposition Workers’ Party, which won an unprecedented 10 seats in parliament, to tackle the current crisis, he said.


  “Regardless whether it’s opposition parties or the PAP, we all have to work together to transcend the challenges of the current moment,” Chan said. “I think the opposition will also join the PAP in making sure that Singapore remains united and cohesive because the challenges that we are confronting now is not between the PAP and the opposition, the challenges that we are facing now is as one country, how do we ride out the crisis and emerge stronger.”


  Hong Kong


  Regarding Hong Kong, Chan noted that investors have been watching the difficult situation in the territory, which has been caught up in the deteriorating relations between the U.S. and China, as well as a sweeping national security law that Chinese leaders passed several weeks ago.


  “I think there will be capital flows from Hong Kong to other parts of the world because of this latest legislation,” Chan said, responding to a question on whether Singapore would see any inflows of capital or people. Even before the legislation, “I think many people would be considering their options as to how to diversify their portfolios” amid risks from the pandemic and rising protectionism.
