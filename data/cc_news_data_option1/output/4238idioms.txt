It added that elevated silver prices and improving metal volumes should aid profitability.Citi also has a 'buy' call on the stock with a target at Rs 240 per share as Q2 earnings are in-line with the Street estimates. It noted that silver accounted for 22 percent of the Q2 revenue.Meanwhile, in an interview with CNBC-TV18, the company's CEO Arun Misra said that the cost of production could rise in this half of the year as the mines had to be prepared for higher volumes in the first quarter of next year.

He added that more dividends were possible as long as the company continued to generate solid cash flows. The company has also declared an interim dividend of Rs 21.30 per share.Commenting on the results, Misra said, &quot;On the back of streamlined operations, we continue to deliver record volumes despite the challenges posed by the pandemic.

It isn‚Äôt just that I am spending more time in a Google search, either. The Silicon Valley company has leveraged the act of looking for something online into such a vast technology empire that it has crept into my home, my work, my devices and much more. It has become the tech brand that dominates my life ‚Äî and probably yours, too.
 On my Apple iPhone, I use Google‚Äôs apps for photo albums and maps, along with tools for calendar, email and documents. On my computer and tablet, the various web browsers I use feature Google as the default search bar. For work, I use Google Finance (to look up stock quotes), Google Drive (to store files), Google Meet (to teleconference) and Google Hangouts (to communicate).
 In my home, Google is also everywhere. My Nest home security camera is made by Google. A Google voice service rings my door buzzer. To learn how to repair a gutter, I recently watched home improvement videos on YouTube. In online maps, Google has photos of my house taken from outer space and camera-embedded cars.
 By my unofficial estimate, I spend at least seven hours a day on Google- related products.
 Google‚Äôs prevalence has brought the company to a critical point. On Tuesday, the Justice Department sued it for anticompetitive practices, in the most significant antitrust action by the U.S. government against a technology company in decades. The government‚Äôs case focused on Google‚Äôs search and how it appeared to create a monopoly through exclusive business contracts and agreements that locked out rivals.
 Google said in a tweet that the lawsuit was ‚Äúdeeply flawed.‚Äù The company added, ‚ÄúPeople use Google because they choose to, not because they‚Äôre forced to or because they can‚Äôt find alternatives.‚Äù
 To Gabriel Weinberg, the chief executive of DuckDuckGo, which offers a privacy-focused search engine, what I have experienced was Google‚Äôs plan all along.
 ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it was happenstance,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve been using their different products to maintain their dominance in their core market, which is search.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is the largest surge we have had,‚Äù she said, and it is most likely caused by several variables, including more testing, spread related to kids returning to schools and sports, and the increase use of a ‚Äúrapid test,‚Äù which gives results in 15 minutes. ‚ÄúThere is so much more testing going on right now.

You can use the AnyList app (which is free to download and compatible with Alexa) and ask Alexa to add grocery items to your list. Then, the next time you're at the store, pull up the list on your phone --and you'll never forget flour again.

 # 11th annual DaHunt for the Cure event raises $80,000
 Times Herald-Record
 MONTGOMERY ‚Äì When the pandemic struck, DaHunt for the Cure founders Charlie and Diane Medici knew they couldn‚Äôt move forward as planned with their sporting clays charity shooting event. However, cancelling was out of the question. Instead, the innovative couple pivoted, extending the event to two days to abide by the state‚Äôs 50-person participation limit. Temperature checks were taken upon arrival, and participants received gaiters to wear.
 Their careful planning paid off. The event held on Sept. 17 and 18 at Ten Mile River Preserve in Dover Plains was as successful as it‚Äôs been in years past. $80,000 was raised for Hudson Valley nonprofit organizations.
 ‚ÄúDiane and I are so proud to have put on this event in these unprecedented, challenging times,‚Äù said DaHunt for the Cure Founder Charlie Medici. ‚ÄúThe unwavering dedication and commitment of event supporters is so appreciated. We look forward to next year and doing it all again!‚Äù
 DaHunt for the Cure joined the Community Foundation of Orange & Sullivan‚Äôs family of funds in 2017.
 ‚ÄúWith the support of the Community Foundation, the Medici‚Äôs will be able to give to these important organizations for years to come,‚Äù said Community Foundation of Orange and Sullivan President and CEO Elizabeth Rowley. ‚ÄúCharlie and Diane truly embody our mission of connecting people who care with causes that matter!‚Äù
 ‚ÄúWe are so grateful for the generous support from DaHunt. Their donation of $25,000 could not have come at a more critical time for us,‚Äù said Gigi‚Äôs Playhouse Co-President Gwyneth Meeks. ‚ÄúAs we reopen our playhouse doors, their donation will allow us to continue to serve our families and community. The therapeutic and educational programs offered by GiGi's Playhouse provide our participants the opportunity to connect, learn and build skills that will empower them for future success.‚Äù
 DaHunt for the Cure was inspired when the Medici‚Äôs nephew, Peter, was diagnosed with leukemia. Peter is now an extremely healthy college graduate in his early 20s and is working for the family business as a project manager. The Medici‚Äôs continue to honor his battle and raise money to support all those who are still fighting today.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm asking the court to give you the maximum the law will allow and then some,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI can only wish the rest of your life and sentence is extremely miserable ‚Äî way beyond what Little Joe suffered.‚Äù                  Turning to his daughter, David Hart said, ‚ÄúI love you with all my heart and soul. That will never change.‚Äù But, he continued, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been spending lots of time trying to figure our how you got so cold-hearted.‚Äù                  David Hart asked Jones how she could stand by and let someone abuse her son. ‚ÄúYou had to hear the screaming and crying and begging for help, yet you chose to do nothing.‚Äù                  Joseph Garbosky Jr., the father of Little Joe, also asked the court to give Powers and Jones the maximum sentence.                  During most of the hearing, the senior Garbosky kept his head down as he wept throughout the proceeding.                  ‚ÄúCandace, how could you let something like this happen to our son?‚Äù he asked Jones as he testified. ‚ÄúWhat would make you stand by as a man murdered my son?‚Äù                  l l l                  Following the victim statements, Wills told the court he had ‚Äúa heavy heart ‚Ä¶ not for the defendants, for this little boy.‚Äù                  Wills told Jones he could not understand how, as a mother, she could have allowed this to happen to her child.                  ‚ÄúIt literally makes me sick,‚Äù Wills said.                  Wills then sentenced Jones to three to 15 years in prison, the maximum time under her plea deal.                  ‚ÄúI am going to make a recommendation to the Department of Corrections that you serve 15 years,‚Äù Wills said. ‚ÄúIf you get out you will have to register as a sex offender, and also have extended supervision for 50 years.‚Äù                  Wills told Jones he was going to recommend a life sentence for him to the Department of Corrections.                  He said Jones, too, will have to register as a sex offender if he is released from prison.                  Wills then concluded the hearing by saying to Jones and Powers, ‚ÄúThe bailiff will now take you away so you can start serving your life sentence and your 15 years.‚Äù                  ¬†                              *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

Jones watched as the abuse occurred, and did nothing to intervene, according to a criminal complaint filed by now-retired West Virginia State Police Sgt. M.D. Clemons, who was with the West Virginia State Police Crimes Against Children unit                  Earlier this month, Powers entered into a best-interest plea in which he pleaded guilty to death of a child by parent or guardian, which carries a possible sentence of 15 years to life in prison. He also pleaded guilty to two counts of child abuse resulting in serious bodily injury. These charges have a possible sentence of two to 10 years in prison.                  Jones pleaded guilty to child neglect resulting in death, which carries a sentence of three to 15 years in prison.

East Tennessee State University‚Äôs Student Government Association Academic Affairs Committee passed a resolution Tuesday condemning the alleged forced resignation of a gay professor at Milligan University earlier this year.
 According to SGA Vice President Seth Manning, the official condemnation also called for ending key partnerships with Milligan. Manning said it‚Äôs about ‚Äúuniversity standards.‚Äù
 The incident, which reportedly happened during the spring semester, has since put the 154-year-old private Christian institution in the center of discussions on and off Milligan‚Äôs campus about anti-LGBTQ discrimination in higher education.
 The ETSU student government committee‚Äôs resolution calls on the university to end athletics scheduling, the pursuit of future academic agreements and ‚Äúpartnerships in which university monies would be paid to Milligan or other universities with such discriminatory policies‚Äù on the basis of sexuality, gender identity, sex, race, disability status, age or religious beliefs.
 ‚ÄúI think it is definitely appropriate for ETSU to take a stand against that,‚Äù Manning said, adding that he believes Milligan‚Äôs actions ran counter to the values of ‚Äúequal rights and general respect.‚Äù
 Milligan President Bill Greer declined to discuss specific personnel decisions and did not say whether a faculty member had been fired due to sexuality.
 ‚ÄúMilligan and ETSU have long held a mutually beneficial relationship between our institutions, so it is regrettable that there would be such a reaction based on what is alleged in the media,‚Äù he wrote in an emailed statement to the Press. ‚ÄúThere is often more to every story, but since this involves a personnel matter, we are unable to comment further.
 ‚ÄúWe appreciate the longstanding, collegial relationship we have enjoyed with ETSU over the years. We have always held a healthy respect for one another‚Äôs mission, due to the diverse nature of the two institutions,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúIt is my hope that we can continue to respect our differences as we continue to partner together to meet the educational needs of this region.‚Äù
 The SGA resolution passed 4-1, with Sen. Matthew Calhoun voting ‚Äúno.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúI personally don‚Äôt see a problem with it,‚Äù Calhoun said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt dislike the LGBTQ community. I just don‚Äôt believe Milligan is in the wrong for doing such.‚Äù
 Athletics scheduling was one key area of focus, according to Manning, who introduced the resolution.
 ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of financial things that go on there, and I think you hit them where the money is at,‚Äù Manning said.
 ‚ÄúWe want to make the statement that Milligan crossed a red line here.‚Äù
 Manning said the issue means a lot to him as someone who identifies both as a Christian and a member of the LGBTQ community.
 ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a fight that matters to me, and it‚Äôs a fight I think we have to win,‚Äù Manning said.
 The resolution will go to the full ETSU Student Government Association Senate, which will vote next week.
 ‚ÄúI believe we have the numbers to pass it and pass it by a pretty substantial margin,‚Äù Manning said. ‚ÄúI believe our senators will stand strong and stand on the right side of history.‚Äù

The share price of Hindustan Zinc rose 4 percent on Wednesday after the company reported its September quarter results. The firm's performance improved in the September quarter on a monthly basis as the net profit rose 43 percent MoM.
 The stock rose as much as 4.1 percent to Rs 232.25 per share on BSE.
 However, the profit has dropped 6.7 percent YoY to Rs 1,940 crore for the quarter due to higher expenses than last year's. The company had posted a net profit of Rs 2,081 crore in the year-ago period.
 The total income of the company increased to Rs 6,050 crore in the quarter from Rs 5,101 crore in the year-ago period. Total expenses of the company during the quarter increased to Rs 3,428 crore from Rs 3,014 crore in the year-ago period.
 The sentiment was also lifted by bullish brokerage views after the earnings.
 Credit Suisse maintained an 'outperform' rating on the stock with a target at Rs 250 per share. It added that elevated silver prices and improving metal volumes should aid profitability.
 Citi also has a 'buy' call on the stock with a target at Rs 240 per share as Q2 earnings are in-line with the Street estimates. It noted that silver accounted for 22 percent of the Q2 revenue.
 Meanwhile, in an interview with CNBC-TV18, the company's CEO Arun Misra said that the cost of production could rise in this half of the year as the mines had to be prepared for higher volumes in the first quarter of next year. He added that COVID-19 had affected mines globally and supply was limited as new zinc projects were not getting commissioned.
 Misra expects current zinc prices to sustain. He added that more dividends were possible as long as the company continued to generate solid cash flows. The company has also declared an interim dividend of Rs 21.30 per share.
 Commenting on the results, Misra said, "On the back of streamlined operations, we continue to deliver record volumes despite the challenges posed by the pandemic. We are setting up Hindustan Zinc for its next phase of growth and are confident to deliver superior value to our stakeholders in a sustainable manner."

"That‚Äôs the sort of behavior you might expect from ISIS that should shock the conscience of every American to see that sort of twisted thinking take root here in America. But all president does, Trump does, is fan the flames of hatred and division in this country. Telling the Proud Boys in the debate with me -- when I said, 'Will you condemn them? He said, 'I‚Äôll tell them to stand back and stand by.' What the hell‚Äôs the matter with this guy?"
