She cites two concurrent federal court cases concerning Seattle police's use of tear gas and chemical agents. In a lawsuit filed by Black Lives Matter - Seattle & King County, a federal judge banned the use of tear gas but left an exception in certain situations at the police chief's discretion. Another federal judge temporarily blocked the Seattle City Council's newly passed ban on tear gas and similar agents, writing that public safety could be threatened if police do not have adequate time to train with new crowd control measures.
 "In other words, a federal court order precluded Mayor Durkan from unilaterally implementing changes to SPD’s court-approved use of force and crowd management policies," Durkan's attorneys wrote.
 The recall effort responded: "It seems important to note here that tear gas and dying are not the only options?"
 The state Supreme Court has agreed to hear Durkan's appeal, but there will be no oral arguments. All filings and arguments are due by Sept. 22, and the court is tentatively scheduled to discuss the case in private Oct. 8.
 If the Supreme Court rejects Durkan's appeal, allowing the recall to go forward, petitioners would have 180 days to collect more than 50,000 signatures from Seattle voters — one-quarter of the votes filed in the last mayoral election — before a special recall election could be held.
 A recall election would be a simple up or down vote on Durkan, with no opponent on the ballot. If the recall succeeded, the City Council president, currently M. Lorena González, would become mayor.
 "As her counsel challenges the legality of this petition, the Mayor will remain focused on how to provide support for small businesses and workers who have lost their jobs, preparing the City’s 2021 budget, slowing the spread of COVID-19, and working to transform policing and community safety," Durkan spokesperson Kelsey Nyland said.

HARRISONBURG, Va. (AP) — James Madison University in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley will transition at least temporarily to primarily online instruction after experiencing a “rapid increase” in cases of COVID-19 among students, the school's president announced Tuesday night. “As a result of a rapid increase in the number of positive cases of COVID-19 in our student population in a short period of time, the university is concerned about capacity in the number of isolation and quarantine spaces we can provide,” JMU President Jonathan Alger wrote in a letter posted on the school's website Tuesday night. The letter said in-person classes will shift online no later than Monday, by which time residential students will be asked to return home unless they seek an exemption to stay. University officials will notify the campus community by Sept. 25 about whether in-person instruction will resume on or after Oct. 5, according to the letter. JMU, a public university, has about 20,000 undergraduate students. With Tuesday's announcement, it joined a growing number of colleges around the U.S. that have reversed course or altered plans for in-person instruction due to the coronavirus pandemic. The school said that while courses are moving primarily online, campus amenities such as dining, health and wellness services still will be offered. “Decisions about refunds have not yet been made, but we will communicate with students and families as soon as possible on that topic,” Alger wrote in his letter. The school was reporting 513 active cases of COVID-19 among students and employees since July 1 on an online dashboard, with the vast majority of cases reported in the past week. The dashboard also indicated 64 of the 143 available quarantine beds were in use. ___ Follow AP...

The NFL has updated its gameday protocols by requiring every coach and staff member in the bench area to wear a mask and reducing the size of each team’s travel party. Owners also will have to follow COVID-19 testing requirements to gain access to the locker room, field or team charter. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said the league, the NFL Players Association and medical experts have “developed a comprehensive set of protocols that put us in the best possible position to complete the season, culminating with the Super Bowl in Tampa Bay.” There were four new confirmed positive tests among players and six new confirmed positives among other personnel from 58,621 tests administered to a total of 8,739 players and team personnel between August 21-29. “We have been really fortunate that cases of COVID-19 are very low across the league,” Goodell said Tuesday. “It is a testament to the plans, but most importantly to the diligence of the players, the teams and their staffs. I would tell you that we still have more work to do. We are not going to get comfortable. We will remain vigilant, resilient, flexible and basically adapt to circumstances as needed with public health as our No. 1 priority as we have all this offseason.” Dr. Allen Sills, the league’s chief medical officer, says the league is monitoring new developments in testing technology and continues to adapt to new information. “We have a relentless opponent here, which is this virus, and we know that there can be new cases that occur no matter how diligent we are with all of our protocols and our personnel,” Sills said. “So we just have to remain very vigilant and realize that we’re still very early on, but we’re encouraged by what we’ve seen so far.” The league is working with public...

ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — A federal judge says minor political parties in New York have failed to make their case that the state violated their constitutional rights by making it harder to qualify as parties and get on the ballot in upcoming elections. The state's new ballot qualification requirements will take effect for now under District Judge John Koetl's Tuesday decision, which is the latest development in an ongoing legal battle Political parties must now receive 2% of the vote — or 130,000 votes— in the previous presidential or gubernatorial election. A state court judge's decision earlier this year put a hold on the change, which took effect Jan. 1. A political party’s status will now be reviewed every other year starting in November. Previously, political parties had to re-qualify every four years by receiving over 50,000 votes in the gubernatorial election. Third parties including the Working Families Party argued the law violated their rights to free association, equal protection and due process in their lawsuit against the state Board of Election and state election commissioners. The minor parties argued that the law was a flagrant and unjustified attempt to limit ballot access ahead of a new public campaign funding system set to launch in New York in 2024. But the judge said the political parties failed to show they'd be harmed by the new law. “It is far from certain that the WFP will fail to achieve the required number of votes,” the judge wrote, in reference to the Working Families Party. “But, even if the WFP did fail to meet that threshold, the WFP could pursue relief at that time.” Legislative leaders and Gov. Andrew Cuomo had appointed a commission to set up the public matching program with a $100 million budget. The commission's...
