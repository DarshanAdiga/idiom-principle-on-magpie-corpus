As Vermont’s students prepare to go back to school a limited number of days each week, the question looms; how do parents balance the need to return to work with the need to keep track of their children and their school work? How do parents make it work when child care options don’t exist, or are prohibitively expensive?
 It’s an issue with more questions than answers, but what we do know is that an economic recovery is not possible without adqequately addressing our child care issues. At an abstract level, we’ve known there was an issue for a long time. What the pandemic has done is to expose the issue for what it is; central to our economic success. We can’t pretend it doesn’t exist. If parents can’t find a suitable place to take care of their children while at work, then parents drop out of the workforce, participate part-time, or try to manage their work from home, while tending their children.
 Without assistance — from the state or federal government — the fear is that we could find ourselves with many fewer day care options. For obvious reasons. Most day care centers are serving fewer children [67 percent fewer according to a national survey], and those who are in business have seen their costs increase with the requirement that they provide personal protective equipment to their staff.
 That’s not sustainable. The can’t continue to operate with fewer children [less income] and higher expenses.
 On top of that, two out of every three children in child care settings have all available parents in the workforce.
 The math is easy to figure. Fewer daycares add up to fewer parents who are able to go to work and more businesses without the necessary help.
 What’s astounding is that we did not blink an eye when it came to supporting federal help for the airline industry, or hotels, or businesses in general, help that ran into the trillions of dollars, yet we continue to ignore the day care industry that all others depend on to open their doors each day.
 It’s an issue nationwide, and particularly so in Vermont. Franklin County, for example, carries the distinction of being a “child care desert.” There are far more children in need of day care than there are providers and if Vermont follows the national trend, there will be even fewer child care centers going forward. They are exhausting what meager resources they have.
 Quality child care was an issue before the pandemic; we limped through by pushing it off as something that was beyond our means to resolve. But now, the question is: Unaffordable compared to what? If parents can’t go to work because they have no affordable place to send their children, then how do businesses cope? How does the economy recover?
 It’s also an issue that affects women more than men, and particularly those on the low end of the income scale. How, for example, does the retail world work if their employees have no place to take care of their children while at work? How does this affect women in the workforce and the decades of progress they’ve made?
 The child care issue is being described as the anchor around the ankle of economy recovery. It’s about time. We’ve been ignoring it long enough. It will cost money. A lot. But it’s a pittance compared to the alternative.

Recently, Monday, Aug 3, I had total left knee replacement surgery performed at Kaiser's San Diego Zion Hospital. It was a basic "in and out" procedure.
 On Saturday evening, Aug. 8, I was laying in bed with my leg elevated and channel surfing, when I settled on the Cowboy Channel, because they were going to feature, among others, portions of the Lawton, Ok, Rodeo. Considering that we have been entertained every day, for weeks, with the disruption and destruction of various cities throughout the country, this turned out to be a gift that remind me a lot of Lawton remains in this 80-year-old body.
 The Cowboy Channel featured Lawton Rodeo's Opening Ceremony, which began with releasing a herd of 20 Texas Longhorns into the arena. They began with a prayer followed with singing of the Star Spangled Banner and posting of the Colors. The flag was carried by a pretty cowgirl on a well adorned horse slowly moving amongst the herd. The grandstands appeared to be close to full capacity. As the camera scanned the stands, every man, woman and child was standing with their hand and/or hat over their heart, a rare occurrence at other sporting events.
 I would appreciate you passing these thoughts on to the Lawton Rangers. They did well. They did themselves, the City of Lawton, Fort Sill and the State of Oklahoma proud, It was a CLASS production which should be shared with the entire country. I would love to have a video copy.

Giuseppe Randazzo era accusato di avere ucciso la moglie Catya Di Stefano, la quale aveva iniziato le pratiche di separazione. Ma l'uomo non era d'accordo, voleva a tutti i costi riallacciare i rapporti con l'ex moglie ed era disposto a tutto. Cinque giorni fa era andato ad aspettarla davanti casa per quello che, pare, doveva essere un ennesimo tentativo di riappacificazione. I due hanno invece litigato pesantemente e violentemente, e tutto è finito in tragedia con la morte di Catya. Lui è stato trovato dalla polizia accanto al corpo senza vita dell'ex moglie, sotto choc, in lacrime e in evidente stato confusionale. Agli agenti non ha saputo fornire alcuna spiegazione sull'accaduto. Dopo un lungo interrogatorio, poco esaustivo, la Procura di Caltagirone ha deciso di arrestare Giuseppe. Catya era un'operatrice socio sanitaria, e lavorava come assistente di persone disabili nel Calatino.

 So, what is there to learn from my all-too-brief time in the passenger seat of both the 2021 Ford Bronco and the 2021 Ford Bronco Sport? Well, first of all, it's obvious that both of these vehicles have been designed to live up to the capability that the Bronco nameplate has possessed during its history. And in addition to being able to party when the roads turn to terra firma, it's clear that great care was taken to ensure the occupants get a slightly more mature and refined experience no matter what is under the tires.
 Of course, there are still metric tons of questions left unanswered. When it comes to how it feels to actually _drive_ these cars and live with all the tech that's baked in there, we'll have to wait just a bit longer. But for those waiting for any good Bronco news with bated breath, you'll be happy to know Ford is _definitely_ on the right path.

MUNSTER’S days of rugby thunder feel sufficiently ancient and fossilised to be the subject of an archaeologist’s dig. Ronan O&rsquo;Gara&rsquo;s latest compelling, thought-provoking appearance on these pages today is a reminder of how it was across those now remote years of eminence when the crimson empire was one on which the sun declined to set.An era of lustre and majesty when Thomond Park felt like the epicentre of the rugby universe; when O&rsquo;Gara, O&rsquo;Connell, Foley, Stringer and Quinlan starred in nights of feral, unmissable theatre; when Leinster were mere carrion on the soles of Munster&rsquo;s shoes; when Stand Up and Fight amounted to a way of life rather than a vacuous marketeer&rsquo;s slogan. O&rsquo;Gara&rsquo;s revealing interview with Cian Tracey offers more than a nostalgic throwback to those lost years of imperium, ferocious Limerick Saturday nights, a Broadway glint cutting through the winter murk.It is also a jolting reminder that Munster&rsquo;s Klopp, their Loughnane, their messianic leader-in-waiting, resides in exile on the Bay of Biscay.And that every day - with respect to Johann van Graan, the South African contracted to coach the province until 2022 – the province delay in making their Hall of Fame out-half an offer he cannot refuse feels like 24 hours squandered.If Munster are a stalled motor requiring jump leads, then it is hard to imagine anybody on the planet more qualified than O&rsquo;Gara to offer a huge, transformative charge of renewal.His bone-deep understanding of the province, the emotional intelligence that is evident each time he speaks, his already glittering coaching CV, the endless pursuit of wisdom that has informed his global apprenticeship, his willingness to challenge himself, all of these things make the 43-year-old a compelling choice.That is before we consider how his charisma and a back catalogue of the highest achievement as the club&rsquo;s greatest out-half would feel like a revitalising shot of adrenaline and hope entering the Munster bloodstream.Since their second Heineken Cup way back in the Jurassic era, the province have been locked in the same old puzzle.European underachievement, false dawns, coaching confusion, the club falling several rungs below their peers. All the time the chasm to old glories widening.In their post-2008 wilderness years, Munster have been impotent in the face of a Leinster whirlwind, one that has yielded four Champions Cups, four Pro 12/14s and a Challenge Cup, shifting power from Limerick to Dublin.If not quite as one-sided as another of Irish sport&rsquo;s preeminent rivalries, the one where Dublin are unbeaten in 15 games against Mayo, still the evidence has accumulated of Leo Cullen&rsquo;s squad operating in a different stratosphere.Munster arrive at the Aviva on Saturday having taken down their great foes in Dublin just once since 2009. Leinster have won six of their last seven meetings at all venues and nine of the last 11.Leinster&rsquo;s shadow has shut out the sunlight.Van Graan is hardly the first coach to thrash about helplessly in the wake of the RDS super club or to thud painfully against a semi-final glass ceiling. Before lockdown placed the season on ice, there was minimal evidence of third season progress, with the southern giants falling at the group stage in Europe for only the fourth time this Millennium.It cemented the sense that his team - even as reached back to back semi-finals in Europe in 2018 and 2019 - were struggling to locate the inventive or explosive combination to take down the continent's elite.Teams against which Munster measure themselves - Saracens, Racing and, their nemesis, Leinster - have comfortably repelled the best Van Graan and his players can muster.If there is justifiable excitement at the recruitment of a pair of Springbok World Cup winners – centre Damian de Allende and hulking lock RG Snyman – the clamour to hand the keys of the kingdom to O&rsquo;Gara will grow should Saturday confirm the one-way trend in the Leinster/Munster relationship.O&rsquo;Gara has never disguised his ambition to coach his home club, though it is equally the case that the loud voice of his inner-perfectionist was unshakeable in its intent to first hoover up every available mote of information and learning.It has taken him to some of the game&rsquo;s most storied strongholds. He was a key figure in Racing 92&rsquo;s reawakening, while his spell in New Zealand with the long untouchable Crusaders, gave him access to the last word in wining expertise. Such was his impact that the most successful club side on the planet dangled a lucrative contract extension before him. But keen to further broaden his horizons and to establish himself as the main man, he moved to La Rochelle.Perhaps O&rsquo;Gara regards as a cautionary tale the manner in which his friend and fellow rugby cerebral, the late, lamented Anthony Foley, struggled with the huge weight of expectation that accompanies the Munster job.And it is true that the pressure on a native son – particularly one with such a storied CV – would dwarf that of an outsider.But ROG, with seven years looking down from the coaching box, is at an entirely different stage of his coaching development than the beloved Foley was when he was promoted to the Thomond Park hotseat in 2014.O&rsquo;Gara is ten months older than Cullen, yet the latter is already five years, 146 games and three trophies into his head coach career with his native province. Three years older than Van Graan, he is in that mid-to-late-40s window when Klopp ascended to the Anfield throne, an age by which Pep Guardiola and Jose Mourinho had won the Champions League and Jim McGuinness had been and gone as Donegal&rsquo;s All-Ireland-winning alchemist.In an Off the Ball interview last year, just before he joined La Rochelle, O&rsquo;Gara ruled out working under Van Graan.Ever the straight talker, he spoke of taking a top job abroad and 'if I&rsquo;m good enough then I can get a job at home on my terms.'The inference was clear. When he becomes Munster coach – and it is a 'when' not an 'if' – he will, like any single- minded, ambitious visionary/obsessive, demand absolute control. As Klopp did at Liverpool, Jim Gavin at Dublin or Liam Sheedy at Tipp.O&rsquo;Gara&rsquo;s innate decency means he would never canvass for the Munster job while another coach is in position - and it is undeniably true that rugby does not spin the revolving door remotely as pitilessly as the Premier League.Yet, still, Van Graan is, essentially, beginning his fourth season. He cannot claim he has not been given ample time to deliver.The sense, in what is ultimately a cut-throat results business, grows that the stars are close to aligning.And that the return from exile of Munster&rsquo;s former kicking king - and one of Ireland&rsquo;s most impressively driven sportsmen - to a job that has long felt like his natural destiny is looming into sharper focus.It is difficult to see Van Graan endure beyond next summer unless discernible progress is made. Given the investment in the newly arrived South African World Cup winners, that most likely means a trophy and the ending of the Leinster inferiority complex. As a player, O'Gara was so often Thomond&rsquo;s talisman, an out- half who faced down his demons to deliver the killshot at the moment of the most suffocating pressure.The suspicion here is that the Red Army&rsquo;s finest chance of a return to those days will arrive only when they turn to their old number ten, a commandant with all those days of thunder battle ribbons pinned to his chest.It seems absurd for Munster to rely on an archaeologist&rsquo;s trowel to locate their ancient stash of gold when a ready-made Midas sits waiting in France.

We've been told by one person close to the situation that at least one senior Michigan football player would not play in the spring given this circumstance, that they would prepare for the NFL draft immediately. It's unclear how many in his position would follow suit. Of course, much of that depends on what the NFL does in terms of potentially moving the draft. Additionally, what about the scholarships? How many players would a program be allowed to retain, especially with incoming 2021 players? And would they be eligible in the spring 2021 season, if that happens?

Katherman said voters are checked out via drivers license number or the last four digits of a social security number before a mail-in ballot is sent to them.
 If a voter has already received a mail-in ballot and decided to vote in person they can do so.
 “You must bring your mail-in ballot with you, turn it in at the poll and you will be able to vote there,” Katherman said. “Which is different than was during the primary.”
 Reasons for rejection of a mail-in ballot application included not being registered to vote to begin with or not being a county resident.
 Blank mail-in ballots are not being distributed though applications are being distributed by parties and other organizations.
 Katherman said his office has received many questions, but no one has turned in any suspicious material to date. Some previous mail-in voters have requested a return to voting in person.
 Other calls have come from voters who forgot that they checked a box on their primary ballot indicating they wanted to vote mail-in during the General Election.
 Other than the volume of mail-in ballots, Katherman said there was little changed from previous elections. He suspected there could be rules changed in the future to allow for more prompt scanning by county election boards.

Oh, shut up, Bob. Yes, the times are a-changin' again, and uniformly for the worst. I admit, as you say in the song, that the waters around me have grown and that I am, in fact, metaphorically drenched to the bone -- as are the 18 million Americans currently unemployed, mostly thanks to coronavirus lockdowns. We've tried to start swimmin', as you advised in the lyrics, but it's a bit hard when everything around us has basically sunk like a stone.
