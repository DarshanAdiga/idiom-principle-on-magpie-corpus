The highest graded race is an A2 and this goes all the way down to a B6 which is one of the lowest form of action. If successful in an A1 or A2 event, you may take the step up in grade and compete in Open Racing, which is the highest quality of greyhound racing.

Nobody's going to tell Michael Christensen of Norfolk he isn't a lucky man.
 In March he stopped by Louie's Liquor in his hometown and bought a Nebraska Lottery "Money Clip" scratch-off ticket. It paid off, to the tune of $50,000.
 Last week, Christensen stopped by the same liquor store and spent $10 on a "20X The Money" ticket, also a scratch-off.
 Lightning struck again. This time, he won $100,000.
 “I couldn’t believe it,” Christensen told lottery officials. “What are the odds? I didn’t think it was real.”
 Well, let's see — the odds of winning the top prize in each game are 1 in 80,000.

The wisteria in Newman's Yard, Fakenham, was believed to be a century old when it finally succumbed to the elements in late September. But it could be that its roots are much older than that - and may even be that they are some of the oldest of their kind in the country. Retired tradesman, John Williamson, 74, from Walsingham, spent many years working in the yard as a painter and decorator. During the early 80s, after he returned after a job in Oxfordshire, he bumped into a tree surveyor assessing the wisteria. "I was at the yard when a chap came to inspect the tree to see if it was okay because the trunk had split many years before and it was being held together by wire and concrete," he said. "We got to chatting and he told me, 'would you believe the roots are estimated to be feeding out of the River Wensum?' "I was also told it was the fifth oldest wisteria in the country." The expert, from Kew gardens, visited the established shrub and confirmed that it is one of the longest in the country. Members of Fakenham's historical society said they had no way of knowing the actual age of the wisteria but have no reason to doubt claims by older townsfolk. Because wisteria is a shrub, not a tree, it could not benefit from a protection order. Mr Williamson said the news made him 'feel his age' after seeing it tower above him almost every week while working. The yard, which is tucked away off Norwich Street, kept the wisteria well hidden. Mayor of Fakenham, Gilly Foortse described its demise as a 'sad day' for the town, something which Mr Williamson echoed. He now hopes there is something placed there to remember the tree. "It is a bit sad to think something that old has come to the end of its life, but that's how things are," he said. "A plaque should be put up there on the wall saying that this area was where one of the oldest wisteria trees was living." His request has been heard by the town's historical society, who have created a webpage in memory of the famous shrub.

LINCOLN — Sports bar owners and managers aren’t sure what to expect for the opening of the Husker football season, which begins Saturday at Ohio State and continues with the home opener on Halloween weekend.
 On one hand, they hope for somewhat close to a normal game-day experience to make up for the difficult months of the pandemic. On the other, those hopes have been sullied by the surging virus and a renewed need to practice social distancing and limit how many people walk in their doors.
 The mantra of Lincoln and Omaha bar owners: Keep your fingers crossed and be ready for anything.
 “The profit comes during football,” said Eric F. Marsh, owner of Longwells bar in Lincoln’s Haymarket. “And that's also where you build up your fat reserves to get through the lean times of the year. I just hope that this year that that is possible for us.”

 He said there needed to be a clear criteria about when a region should go into Tier 3 of the alert and the level of cash it received.

With such an unceasingly dark tone to the album, the moments of genuine beauty stand out all the more. The cinematic and mournful string climax of "Pain Everyday" draws out a certain peaceful conclusion to the tragic story. Similarly, the entrancing instrumental on "Enlacing" is a fantastic psychedelic counterpoint to the cosmic horror of the lyrics, putting the listener right in the club with the protagonist as they struggle against an impending demise. Finally, the closing ambient piece, "Secret Piece" is a far more digestible field recording than "Piano Burning" from _There Existed An Addiction to Blood_ , which was quite literally a recording of a piano burning for 18 minutes. The early morning forest sounds of "Secret Piece" instead feels like a hard-earned peace after the brutality of the preceding record.
