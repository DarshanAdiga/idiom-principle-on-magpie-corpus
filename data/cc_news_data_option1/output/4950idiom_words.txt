And it's apparently carried over. "Since August, the numbers have decreased, but with the amount of knowledge bettors gained over those first few months, action on the sport has remained good," says Kevin Dawn, who runs the Barstool Sportsbook at the Ameristar in Black Hawk. "Most of the action on table tennis is live betting on the apps, as it is fast-moving and bettors get quick results. Because of the pandemic, table tennis was able to create a niche, and the more changes in the normal sports schedule, the longer that niche will be around to pick up the action."


  While many of the eighteen mobile apps and twelve sports-betting retail locations now active in Colorado offer wagers on table tennis, which mainly revolves around a professional league in Russia, Monarch Casino in Black Hawk, which has its own in-person sportsbook and mobile app, has chosen not to include it. Monarch management has concerns about the integrity of the league and isn't convinced that matches are 100 on the up-and-up, according to casino staffers.


  In June, the Colorado Division of Gaming "was made aware of a concern involving Moscow Liga Pro, a Russian table tennis league," prompting an investigation, according to division spokesperson Suzanne Karrer. "The division did not identify any reasons that rose to the level of suspending it or taking it out of play."


  But while bets on Russian table tennis are still allowed in Colorado, the state has taken action on leagues in another country.
