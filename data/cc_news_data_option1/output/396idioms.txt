Smith was the No. 1 overall pick by San Francisco in 2005 ahead of Aaron Rodgers.

White House officials insist that their handling of Bolton’s manuscript was legally sound. But however by the book they played the initial review of the manuscript, the strategy proved politically treacherous.


--DocBreak--
“All quid pro quos are not the same," he retorted. Some might be acceptable, some not. “And you don't need to be a mind reader to figure out which is which. For one thing, you can ask John Bolton."          With voting on witnesses later this week, Democrats, amid the backdrop of protesters swarming the Capitol, are making a last-ditch push to sway Republicans to call Bolton and others to appear for testimony and ensure a “fair trial."          Trump faces charges from the House that he abused his power like no other president, jeopardizing Ukraine and U.S.-Ukraine relations by using the military aid as leverage while the vulnerable ally battled Russia. The second article of impeachment says Trump then obstructed the House probe in a way that threatened the nation's three-branch system of checks and balances.          Over two days, senators are grilling the House Democrats prosecuting the case and the Republican president's defense team. Dozens of questions were asked and answered Wednesday in five-minute clips, with senators under orders to sit silently without comment, submitting their questions in writing. They finished shortly past 11 p.m. and were expected to keep going Thursday.          Democratic leader Chuck Schumer asked whether the Senate could really render a fair verdict without hearing from Bolton or acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, both potential eyewitnesses to Trump's actions.          “Don’t wait for the book. Don’t wait ’til March 17, when it is in black and white to find out the answer to your question,” Schiff told the Senate.          That publication date is now in doubt. The White House on Wednesday released a letter to Bolton's attorney objecting to “significant amounts of classified information" in the manuscript, including at the top secret level. Bolton and his attorney have insisted the book does not contain any classified information.          The White House action could delay the book's publication if Bolton, who resigned last September — Trump says he was fired — is forced to revise his draft.

Producing confectionary products with the use of raising agents is gaining traction across the global food production landscape. Over the forecast period, sales of raising agents across confectionary applications are expected to register a global value CAGR of 3.9%, reflecting fastest revenue growth. Fried fish product applications of raising agents are also likely to gain considerable traction in terms of revenues. The report, however, observes a declining demand for raising agents in bakery product applications. Nonetheless, bakery applications of raising agents will continue to account for largest chunk of the global revenue pie, registering a one-fourth share on global market value by 2026-end.

The Pentagon did not announce the first confirmed cases until more than a week after the Iranian attack; at that point it said there were 11 cases. The question of American casualties took on added importance at the time of the Iranian strike because the degree of damage was seen as influencing a U.S. decision on whether to counterattack and risk a broader war with Iran. Trump chose not to retaliate, and the Iranians then indicated their strike was sufficient for the time being.

Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine tried to give fresh momentum to a one- for-one witness deal, saying it's “very important that there be fairness, that each side be able to select a witness or two.” But Democrats dismissed those offers.
 “It's irrelevant. It's a distraction,” said Schumer.
 Collins, Murkowski and Utah Sen. Mitt Romney signaled an interest in calling Bolton or other witnesses, and questions and answers at times appeared directed at them.
 Schiff’s response to Dershowitz focused on one particular senator: He asked his audience to imagine what would have happened if then-President Barack Obama asked the Russians to dig up dirt on then-candidate Romney, the GOP’s 2012 presidential nominee?
 Romney, standing at the back of the chamber, smiled occasionally at mention of his name.
 Far from voiding the last election, Schiff said, impeachment is protecting the next one, in 2020, from any future Trump efforts to ask foreign governments to intervene.
 Republicans tried to engage the president's defense, at times raising the profile of the still anonymous government whistleblower whose complaint about Trump's July 25 call with Ukraine sparked the impeachment inquiry. Democrats kept focus on the case for Trump's conviction and removal, which would require 67 votes in the Senate and seems unlikely.
 At times, there were telling exchanges. In one, the White House team could not fully respond when Collins and Murkowski asked if Trump had ever pursued Biden investigations before the former vice president announced his presidential bid in 2019.
 Philbin argued that relying on foreign information in a U.S. campaign isn't necessarily a campaign law violation, drawing objections later from Democrats. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., who said he was “flabbergasted.”
 In another, Dershowitz acknowledged he has changed his thinking on what the Founders intended with impeachment and keeps “refining” his views.
 As the long night drew to a close, so did Schiff's remarks, warning senators they were lowering the bar for Trump, dressing it up with legalese.

Bend High coach Allison Gardner will not want to hear this, but her team is riding an 11-game winning streak after its Mountain Valley Conference victory over Sprague. And the Lava Bears have not lost since the first week of December.
 It is the Bears’ longest winning streak since 2018 when they won 13 straight en route to a Class 5A state semifinal appearance. This winning streak has come in Class 6A, Oregon’s highest classification.
 “I don’t like to talk about it,” Gardner said. “But we are doing really well. (The girls) show up and work hard every practice. They’ve bought into the plan, and everyone is on the same page. They are building confidence in what we are trying to accomplish and in each other.”
 The Lava Bears (4-0 MVC, 11-2 overall) made quick work of the Olympians (0-4, 4-11) Tuesday night, holding the visitors from Salem to seven points or fewer in each quarter to win 64-18.
 “I was proud of our girls,” Gardner said. “We met all the goals that we set. We took care of the ball. We shared the ball and how we wanted to execute on offense because we really had to be crisp and clean some things up.”
 Three Lava Bears scored in double figures, led by Caitlin Wheeler and Ava Dennis’ 14. Nine of the 10 players who saw action on Tuesday scored.
 The Bend offense hummed along, getting easy buckets in transition and methodically moving the ball around until an easy bucket was available.
 “We are passionate about basketball and passionate about making each other look good on the court,” Wheeler said.
 “We always look for each other first,” said Kaycee Brown, who added 12 points. “We have a good sense of where our teammates are going to be.”
 But where Bend High thrived against Sprague was on defense. It was the fourth time during the winning streak that the Lava Bears have held their opponent to fewer than 20 points.
 The Lava Bears used a full-court press in the first half that overwhelmed Sprague in the backcourt. For more than six minutes in the second quarter, the Lava Bears held the Olympians without a point. In the final three quarters, Sprague made a total of just four field goals.
 “Defensively, we were working on ways that we were handling screens in our man-to-man defense,” Gardner said. “I was really proud of how we worked through that.”

Those poor 400 people stuck on the 7.40am Norwich to London train for five hours on Tuesday before they were rescued on to the tracks by ladder.
 If we had been stuck on the old bone shaker Norwich to London train Greater Anglia treated us to last week, we'd have needed antibiotics, treatment for hypothermia and a spell in recovery.
 I have never travelled on a dirtier, scruffier, colder train than the 10.30am "replacement train" last Wednesday, and I've been on some shockers.
 Congratulations Greater Anglia. You really surpassed yourself and ruined the first part of our long-awaited day out.
 Logistics problems happen on rail networks. We understand. Contingency plans are sometimes needed when trains break down. We get it.
 But there really is no excuse to impose such revolting conditions on paying passengers, who expect and deserve better, and then saying or doing nothing remotely apologetic about it.
 "You'd better get a coffee now because there's no food or drink on board," warned a friend I met on the platform when we arrived at Norwich Station. "It's one of those old trains."
 Like him and his family, we had first class tickets for our day out. The train we travelled on had no tables, no buffet car or even trolley, its floor and seats were filthy and it was so cold we huddled in our coats for the entire two hours.
 The once white seat protectors on the headrests were grubby and grey and the toilets, two carriages away, were revolting.
 The carriage was so grim, we didn't touch the snacks and bottle of bubbly we'd brought to launch our day out.
 Customers are treated with this like it or lump it attitude that says everything about its view of the travelling public and its lack of pride in its service.
 It feels that it expects people to be grateful they're getting a train at all, illustrating a shameful disregard for customers who have no choice.
 It's this disregard and dismissive attitude that really gets the public heckles up. If that was the only train at Great Anglia's disposal, and there was no choice but to use it, an explanation and apology was the least the company could do.
 If you pay for a first-class ticket, the least you expect is a table for the two-hour trip and a basic level of cleanliness. You don't expect to have to buy your coffee at the station, zip up your coat to keep warm for the journey and avoid touching anything without hand cleanser and using the loo at all costs.
 But at least we got a moving train that left on time, which is more that can be said for the thousands of passengers left stranded, late for meetings and appointments on Northern Rail, whose atrocious service has been played out this week.

 Democratic leader Chuck Schumer asked whether the Senate could really render a fair verdict without hearing from Bolton or acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, both potential eyewitnesses to Trump's actions.
 “Don’t wait for the book. Don’t wait ’til March 17, when it is in black and white to find out the answer to your question,” Schiff told the Senate.
 That publication date is now in doubt. The White House on Wednesday released a letter to Bolton's attorney objecting to “significant amounts of classified information" in the manuscript, including at the top secret level. Bolton and his attorney have insisted the book does not contain any classified information.
 The White House action could delay the book's publication if Bolton, who resigned last September — Trump says he was fired — is forced to revise his draft.

In an interview earlier, co-producer Khaitan revealed that Bhanu was reluctant to present the script to Dharma Productions initially since the banner is not known for backing horror movies.
