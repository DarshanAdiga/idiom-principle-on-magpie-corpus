To address any possible scenario, including an outbreak of the new virus on campus, Drew has designated quarantine and isolation locations, a “stay at home at Drew” approach, and evacuation protocols. Students who are able to return home to quarantine or isolate will be required to do so.
 Starting with incoming first-year students and transfer students, students will move on campus during a staggered three-week period beginning Aug. 16.
 For the first three weeks of the semester, all instruction will be delivered through virtual platforms but residential life and other campus activities will be face to face.
 In-person instruction will begin Sept. 14. Through Nov. 20, Drew intends to have as much face-to-face learning as possible, Baenninger said.
 To reduce movement from and back to campus and decrease the risk of students bringing COVID-19 to campus, on-campus residency will end Thanksgiving week with a staggered move out of campus housing.
 Post-Thanksgiving classes and exams will take place remotely.
