To express their concerns, unnamed educators have turned to “An Anonymous Teacher Speaks,” a discussion site started last month by Martin. It has quickly become a collective cry for help, with demoralized teachers saying they felt “defeated,” “overloaded,” “terrified,” “ignored and frustrated” and on the brink of quitting. A few even disclosed having suicidal thoughts.
 “I work until midnight each night trying to lock and load all my links, lessons, etc. I never get ahead,” one anonymous educator wrote. “Emails, endless email. Parents blaming me because their kids chose to stay in bed, on phones, on video games instead of doing work.”
 Teachers singled out hybrid programs requiring them to instruct in-person and remote students simultaneously as being particularly taxing.
 On Mondays and Tuesdays, Gross, a high school English teacher in Lincroft, New Jersey, teaches cohorts of ninth and 12th graders in her classroom while at the same time instructing other students who are learning from home by video. On Thursdays and Fridays, the second group comes to school while the first group tunes in from home.
 She also teaches a third group of students who never come to school because they are doing remote-only learning this fall.
 “You’re trying to be two people at once, trying to help the students who are online and the students who are in front of you,” Gross said, adding that the remote students often can’t hear their peers in the classroom and vice versa.
 All the while, she tries to keep one eye on the classroom, making sure her in- person students are wearing masks and maintaining social distance, and the other eye online where remote students often need her help troubleshooting computer and connectivity problems.
 “It’s not sustainable,” Gross said. “That’s the hardest thing to come to grips with for myself and my colleagues.”
 Teachers in schools providing remote-only learning said they too were run ragged, though for different reasons.

In a normal school year, Mircea Arsenie, an environmental science teacher at a Chicago public high school, teaches lab classes where students learn through hands-on experiences, like dissecting the stomachs of birds to examine the plastic trash they have swallowed. With remote-only learning in the Chicago Public Schools this fall, he has had to entirely remake his teaching approach.

An engagement to Gross would be third time lucky for Monk, 40, who was engaged to Good Charlotte guitarist Benji Madden in 2007, before they split a year later, and American millionaire Jimmy Esebag in 2011 which quickly fizzled.
