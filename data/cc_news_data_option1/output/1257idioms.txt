One of the most talked about sequences in _Batman v Superman_ since the film's release is the "Knightmare Sequence" that sees Batman in a post-apocalyptic future. Snyder discussed his thought process behind the scenes and how it would have tied into _Justice League_. Snyder said the sequence is a byproduct of the Flash (Ezra Miller) using the cosmic treadmill and creating a rift in time. There was going to be scene in a later film in which we would have seen Bruce Wayne and Cyborg deliberating on what point to send the Flash back to so that he can prevent Lois' death. Snyder revealed that it is Lois Lane's death that leaves Superman open to being infected by Darkseid's Anti-Life Equation, and the incident that would have led to the Knightmare future the Justice League would have attempted to avoid.

Russia took early steps to counter the outbreak, closing the borders with China and then barring access to Chinese citizens last month when China was still the world's hottest coronavirus spot.
 Authorities followed up by screening arrivals from Italy, France, Spain and other countries worst-affected by the outbreak, and obliging them to self- quarantine. Last week Russia cut all international commercial flights and finally fully closed its borders effective Monday, with the exception of diplomats, truck drivers and a few other categories.
 Russian officials said those measures helped slow down the spread of COVID-19, but acknowledged that the disease is accelerating rapidly and relatively low numbers of confirmed cases could be explained by insufficient screening.
 For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms such as fever and cough. But for others, especially older adults and people with prior health problems, it can cause severe symptoms like pneumonia and can be fatal.
 Authorities have converted several hospitals in Moscow to treat coronavirus patients and thousands of construction workers labored around the clock at a construction site on Moscow's outskirts to build a new specialized hospital to be ready in a few weeks.
 The Defense Ministry also launched a massive effort to build 16 hospitals across the country in a matter of weeks. Last week, the military also conducted massive drills across Russia to disinfect and quarantine broad areas.

Make a plan for the money you get: Focus on necessities, like housing and food, to ensure your basic needs are met.
 If you have anything left over, you might be tempted to throw this money at debts. But saving should take priority right now, says Diane Pearson, a financial adviser at Pearson Financial Planning in Pennsylvania.
 “We don’t know how long this situation might last and there might be a need for this money down the road,” Pearson says.
 For many people, this money won’t cover all of their expenses, even after all governmental and nonprofit resources are tapped. In that event, accruing debt to cover expenses may be a last-resort option but can be done strategically. Many of the “rules” about using credit cards don’t apply right now.
 “If you're going to get further in debt, do it with a plan and make sure you’re utilizing the best available options for you,” Holt says. “Don’t assume there aren’t options.” She suggests exploring loan options from local credit unions, for example, and steering clear of high-interest loans like payday loans.
 ##  Still have a job? Build savings.

Although the Scout Ship, which served as Superman's Fortress of Solitude in _Man of Steel_ , was destroyed, the hero isn't without his place for reflection. Snyder referred to the scene between Clark and his father, Jonathan Kent (Kevin Costner) at the top of a snowy mountain as the Fortress of Solitude being internalized. Rather than the idea of a giant crystalline structure, Snyder wanted the Fortress to be "organic," part of Clark himself. The answer he finds from his father in that moment of solitude is that "trying to do the right thing can have tragic results, but the lesson is you have to try because it is the right thing." Snyder said that it is important that the lesson Jonathan imparted on Clark be related to farming, and tied to nature, which is what he sees Superman as inherently tied to. Bruce's own moment of solitude in the ruins of Wayne Manor in which he reflects on his family's fortune being built on hunting is tied to commerce and industry. Snyder said he saw both characters as being represented by natural elements.
