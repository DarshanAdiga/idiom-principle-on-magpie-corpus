"That's the way that the world goes 'round'

 It's half an inch of water, and you think you're gonna drown;
   
 That's the way that the world goes 'round."

 As coronavirus cases surge again, most of us worry that another economic slowdown is in the offing. Getting the virus under control is commensurate with returning to full economic strength.
   
 So does the federal government have the firepower to sustain the economy while tens of thousands of businesses cut back or close their doors again? Actually, it does.
   
 Now let's be forthright. The national debt has gone from $22.5 trillion to over $26 trillion in about eight months. So we've increased the debt by over 15% in less than a year. Ouch. As a nation with a fiat currency system, we can always print more money, and we've recently discussed how the U.S. is likely to never pay off its debt. Borrowing is so inexpensive right now, though, that even modest inflation over time will mean that the dollars we're repaying won't be worth as much as they were when they were originally borrowed. That said, none of us want to witness the federal debt grow unchecked.
   
 At any rate, the debt ship sailed long ago. The idea that we're going to balance the federal budget annually and incur no annual deficit (which adds to the cumulative debt) does not seem to be gaining any foothold in Congress.
   
 So if we are forced to endure another slowdown, how will the federal government react? By utilizing more financial firepower at its disposal, and there's plenty of dry powder. Federal emergency credit facilities have lent $95 billion so far, only about 20% of the resources they have at their disposal. As of June 17th, the $600 billion Main Street Lending Program had yet to distribute any money. Equally as important, the Federal Reserve continues its pace of net QE asset purchases at a rate of $30 billion per week.
   
 The Federal Reserve has thus far purchased a total of about $7 billion in bond ETF's and has also begun buying individual corporate bonds. But this is a minuscule percentage of the dollars that the government can spend buying securities to stabilize markets.
   
 More dollars will likely be appropriated for the unemployed. It's difficult to determine what the actual unemployment rate is currently, but it's safe to say it's as high as it has been at any time since the Great Depression. So an extension of enhanced personal unemployment benefits, many of which will run out soon, is probably under consideration as well.
   
 We simply have no choice but to rely on government financial intervention to guide us through this crisis. Monetary authorities are determined to stave off a deflationary bust, and governments typically get what they want. None of us particularly like it, but without it, individuals, businesses and investors will suffer terribly.

Even in real estate, Pharrell Williams' style stands out. The Grammy-winning artist's Hollywood Hills home -- a dazzling glass-covered compound known as the Skyline Residence -- has come up for sale at $11.95 million.
   
 Williams has a penchant for buying architecturally interesting estates. Earlier this year, he put his 17,000-square-foot mansion that looks like a supervillain's lair on the market for $16.95 million in Beverly Hills.
   
 The Skyline Residence boasts a similar dramatic look, stretching across 1.5 acres on a ridgetop setting with sweeping views of the city and valley below. The home was designed and built in 2007 by Hagy Belzberg, the architect responsible for the striking subterranean Los Angeles Museum of the Holocaust in Pan Pacific Park.
   
 Covered in concrete and glass, the low-slung abode boasts vast open living spaces with clean lines, hardwood floors and white gallery walls. Highlights include a spacious foyer, minimalist kitchen and dining area anchored by a garden wall. The master suite, one of five bedrooms, tacks on a built-in fireplace and green marble bathroom.
   
 Walls of glass open out back, where a thin stretch of lawn adjoins an infinity pool. The scenic estate also includes a two-story guesthouse with a bedroom and kitchen and a front garden with a movie projector.
   
 A singer, rapper, producer and fashion designer, Williams, known simply as Pharrell, formed the hip-hop production duo the Neptunes in the mid-'90s and started the band N.E.R.D. later that decade. The 47-year-old has won 13 Grammys and received two Oscar nominations, including one for his hit song "Happy."
   
 End of a run in Beverly Hills
   
 Married actors Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis are looking to shed their Beverly Hills home of six years, listing the property for sale at $13.995 million.
   
 That's $3.78 million more than the power couple paid for the estate a few months after getting engaged in 2014.
   
 Built about two decades ago and since updated, the estate spans half an acre in the gated community of Hidden Valley near Franklin Canyon Park.
   
 A three-story traditional-style house is at the heart of the estate and has five bedrooms and 5.5 bathrooms in 7,351 square feet. A landscaped yard and flagstone walkway approach the house, which draws the eye with stone accents and black plantation shutters.
   
 French doors, oak floors and crown molding touch up the common spaces. The formal living room expands to a mahogany office, and the chef's kitchen leads to a breakfast nook and family room with a fireplace. Other highlights include a gym, sauna and wine cellar.
   
 A covered patio extends off the back of the home, descending to a grassy yard with a swimming pool, spa and grill.
   
 Kutcher and Kunis both gained fame in the late 1990s as part of the cast of "That '70s Show." Kutcher has since appeared in the films "My Boss's Daughter," "The Butterfly Effect" and "Jobs." Kunis has film credits that include "Forgetting Sarah Marshall" and "Black Swan," the latter of which earned her a Golden Globe nomination.
   
 His Wild, Wild West
   
 The Malibu home of Robert Conrad, the actor known for his popular roles on the 1960s shows "Hawaiian Eye" and "The Wild, Wild West," has come up for sale in Malibu for $5.195 million.
   
 Conrad, who died in February at 84, bought the ocean-view property in 2011 for $1.35 million and reimagined the existing 1970s residence into a light-filled contemporary. The house faces a stretch of beach where the actor learned to surf in the 1950s, according to listing agent Rochelle Maize of Nourmand & Associates.
   
 "Robert really enjoyed the Malibu lifestyle and taking advantage of the five- minute walk to the beach to surf," Maize said.
   
 Designed to capture the view, the two-story house has high ceilings, walls of glass and a wrap-around balcony that extends the living space outdoors. The 3,765-square-foot floor plan includes a two-story living room, four bedrooms and five bathrooms.
   
 Outside, some three-quarters of an acre hold a salt-water swimming pool, an outdoor kitchen and a fire pit. A beach volleyball court and putting green sit off to the side.
   
 Conrad, who was renowned for performing his own stunts, became an overnight star after "Hawaiian Eye" debuted in 1959 and cemented his status in the '60s as the two-fisted star of "The Wild, Wild West." A native of Chicago, he also appeared in the show "Baa Baa Black Sheep" as well as the films "Young Dillinger" (1966) and "The Lady in Red" (1979).
   
 He's lost his home-court advantage
   
 Former Los Angeles Lakers guard Jordan Clarkson has made a move in the San Fernando Valley, selling his home in Woodland Hills for $3.25 million.
   
 Clarkson, 27, purchased the five-bedroom, seven-bathroom Cape Cod-inspired house in 2018 -- roughly two months after being traded by the Lakers to the Cleveland Cavaliers -- for $3.199 million.
   
 Built in 2018, the 5,800-square-foot home features high ceilings, crisp white millwork and hardwood floors throughout. A double-island kitchen, a wine vault and a home theater are among details of note. The master suite, which has its own fireplace and a walk-in closet, opens to a terrace overlooking the backyard.
   
 The house sits on about half an acre with a cabana, an outdoor kitchen and a salt-water swimming pool and spa.
   
 Clarkson found himself on the move for the second time in his career last year when the Cavaliers dealt him in December to Utah in a package for Dante Exum. The combo guard was averaging 15.1 points in 63 games last year before the NBA season was put on hiatus due to concerns over the pandemic.
   
 He is in the final year of a four-year, $50 million extension he originally signed with the Lakers in 2016.
   
 Sale in store for Skyhill Studios
   
 The Hollywood Hills home that late musician-songwriter Leon Russell once used as a recording studio has come up for sale at $1.398 million.
   
 The green-hued ranch-style house is where Russell lived and recorded in the late 1960s and early '70s. The Moody Blues and singer-songwriter Marc Benno, as well as blues guitarists Albert and Freddie King, were among those to record with the multi-instrumentalist at the home, which was known as Skyhill Studios.
   
 It's also where Russell recorded some of his own studio albums including his first solo LP, "Leon Russell," with the likes of Joe Cocker, Mick Jagger, Buddy Harman, Eric Clapton and Ringo Starr, among others.
   
 Looking like something out of a time capsule, the 2,892-square-foot house has a rock-wall fireplace in the living room, a den, four bedrooms and three bathrooms. Lush landscaping surrounds a patio in the backyard.
   
 Russell, who died in 2016 at 74, was a genre-bending musician who performed piano rock, blues, gospel and country music. As a songwriter, his hits include "A Song for You," "Tight Rope" and "This Masquerade." As a producer, he worked on albums for artists including Cocker and Bob Dylan.
   
 He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2011.
   
 The property last sold in 1972 for $60,000.

GRAND RAPIDS -- A new startup is helping businesses in Grand Rapids, Holland, Muskegon and Kalamazoo maintain a safe work environment during the ongoing pandemic.
   
 HealthBaar, based in Grand Rapids, was founded by longtime nurse Nathan Barr.
   
 "I started my practice back in 2009 in the emergency department," Baar said. "I eventually ended up in a director-level position with scope over several service lines. I decided to meld my interest in business with my leadership skills. I wanted to find a solution that would push for accessibility and price transparency in healthcare."
   
 HealthBaar aims to provide businesses with services like temperature screenings, workplace evaluations, infection prevention, COVID-19 testing and education sessions without the aid of insurance.
   
 "We want to make our services affordable," Baar said. "And we want to be open about our prices. We want our customers to be able to order exactly what they want and know exactly what they're going to pay. We've already worked with a number of manufacturing companies, laboratories and even schools."
   
 HealthBaar has a set hourly rate for each service. Temperature screenings, for example, will cost a company $60 per hour -- while a workplace evaluation will cost $90 per hour.
   
 Although the focus is currently on businesses, Baar would someday like to expand his services to individuals.
   
 "The healthcare field is changing," he wrote in a media release. "And that not only pertains to how services are provided, but also how clinicians are employed. Nontraditional shifts, flexible work environments and freelance opportunities will transform the clinical world.
   
 "Decentralizing services provided within the four walls of a hospital will allow patients and businesses the opportunity to consume healthcare more conveniently and not be exposed to the hospital environment."
   
 So far, HealthBaar has completed over 16,000 employee screenings and 3,000 COVID-19 tests.
   
 "Screening your workforce with skilled clinicians can provide your company with the opportunity to track sickness trends within their workforce," Barr wrote. "Which may better help determine whether operations need to be stopped for a period of time or if specialized cleaning needs to take place. Staying ahead of the viral spread is more important now than ever."
