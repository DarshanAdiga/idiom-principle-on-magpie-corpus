Tranmere Rovers chairman Mark Palios says it would cost his club up to £500,000 if games were played behind closed doors for the rest of the season
 Sport around the world is taking measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus, with events taking place without spectators and even being postponed.
 But what is the financial cost to teams when games are played behind closed doors, and does that even matter given the wider health concerns?
 In football, Italy's Serie A or England's Premier League might be able ride out any shortfall because TV income rather than ticket sales make up the bulk of their revenue.

Chennai, Mar 10 (PTI) Struggling for form, last season I-League champions Chennai City FC face Maziya S&R; Club of Maldives in their opening group match of the AFC Cup here on Wednesday.
 Chennai have been inconsistent this season and they lie seventh in the I-League points table. The team will need to improve its performance by several notches if it aims to start its campaign on a winning note.
 Maziya, on the other hand, would be hoping to continue their good run against Indian teams after beating Bengaluru FC in the play-offs.
 Chennai mid-fielder Sandro is back in training and could take field tomorrow.
 For the Maldives team, Ibrahim Mahudhee Hussain and Cornelius Stewart will be the key players.
 The home team coach Akbar Nawas said his players were looking forward to Wednesday's game.
 "I think everyone is excited to play the AFC Cup game. This is very good motivation to play in Chennai and we are looking forward to it," he said at the pre-match press conference.
 Chennai City used to play their I-League matches in Coimbatore but they are back in this southern metropolis for this AFC Cup match.
 Maziya have come into the Group E game having beaten the 2018-19 ISL champions Bengaluru FC in a two-leg affair to qualify for the group stage of the AFC Cup and Nawas said he is aware of the Maldives' outfit's capabilities.
 "We can't underestimate them. They are good team and beat Bengaluru FC. Being the only representativce from India in the tournamant is motivation enough," he added.
 Asked about the upcoming I-League game against Neroca FC, Nawas said, "We are focussed on tomorrow's game only. Neroca comes next. We're playing with just four foreigners since the start of the season."
 Maziya S&R; Club coach Marjan Sekulovski said the mood in the camp was good and they were looking for a good performance.
 "Always Maziya play for win. Tomorrow also we will," he said.

Without looking at a webpage I probably couldn’t tell you when a certain school won its last championship (other than those I’ve been around for).
 I’m not a Nebraska sports encyclopedia. I’m not from here; I’m an adopted Cornhusker. But in my time here, I’ve developed close connections with the schools we cover on a regular basis.
 (I know, your school doesn’t get enough coverage. They never do).
 While at the girl’s state basketball tournament in Lincoln this past weekend, I was interviewed by Spirit Catholic Radio during halftime of a game, and I was referred to as the “St. Cecilia beat writer for the Hastings Tribune.”
 I laughed. But I can see why one would think that. I certainly wasn’t offended.
 I even joked earlier this winter that Chapman Gymnasium was my second home because I was there so often throughout the first weeks of the basketball season.
 I’ve spent many hours watching the St. Cecilia girl’s basketball team warm up with their blue and white striped old-fashioned pants and then bury teams on the scoreboard over the last few years.
 I’ve interviewed the Hawkettes’ head coach Greg Berndt probably the most of any since I’ve been here.
 I haven’t yet counted, but I would be willing to bet that in my three years working for this newspaper, I’ve watched St. Cecilia, specifically on the hardwood, more than any other of our 20-plus schools in the Tribland.
 Some of you reading this might ridicule that claim, call it favoritism. And that’s okay.
 But I’m not here to argue about any of that.
 I’m here because on Sunday I woke up feeling like a champion, too.
 When St. Cecilia won its first of two C-2 titles in a row last March I felt an overwhelming joy.
 This was a team that had won 27 of its 28 games that season. Dominated. And that’s how you could also describe the championship game — an 18-point win over Crofton, a team which has caused so much frustration over the last decade.

 A few years later, I signed a contract to play quarterback for a team in France after winning the equivalent of the Super Bowl in Sweden. I was single and as focused as I’d ever been, but then I met another girl.

Nothing will ever be exactly as you picture it. I always say the key to happiness is low expectations. Be ready to go with the flow and be flexible once you start your journey - that's what makes being a digital nomad amazing: being able to follow your heart around the world. You have to find what works best for you. I was in a very privileged position to be able to take this leap - I had valued skills and experience, financial independence, a supportive family, no real responsibilities, and an American passport. If you don't have those things, you can still be a digital nomad, there will just be additional challenges along the way. But no matter your circumstances, planning your transition to nomadic life before you make the leap will make you more likely to succeed - whatever your definition of success is.

People really seem to struggle with the word “coup.”
 During the impeachment ordeal of Bill Clinton, Democrats and their journalistic allies routinely denounced the effort as a “coup.” Some 20 years later, Republicans and their supporters called the impeachment of Donald Trump a “coup” as well.
 Neither of these events was a coup. According to the dictionary, a coup means to overthrow the government, usually by force. It’s short for “coup d’état,” which is illegal. The impeachment power is laid out in America’s rulebook — the Constitution — in black and white.

How will you take care of your health, safety, and property while abroad? I made sure to go to my doctor, dentist, gynecologist, and dermatologist while I was still on my employers' health insurance. I went to a travel clinic to get all the vaccinations I might need (and dang was the Japanese Encephalitis vaccine expensive). I got an IUD so I wouldn't have to worry about birth control. I agonized over health and travel insurance plans, and eventually opted for travel medical insurance designed for nomads, Safety Wing. It's relatively new and I couldn't find a lot of testimonials from real users, so it felt a bit risky, especially because even though I'm young and healthy, I seem to have a propensity for injury. But I liked that it was designed by nomads for nomads and has all the coverage I'd want outside of annual checkups - and most of all, that it's only $US37 dollars a month. I didn't get travel insurance, and I still stress about the fact that if all my stuff gets stolen, I'll have to pay out of pocket to replace all of it. However, with the amount I'm saving on health and travel insurance, I'll have the money to cover myself - and less of a chance that I'll have to spend that money (knock on wood).

I wasn’t around for the Crofton years. But I know how meaningful that win was. I felt it through interviews and emotions that poured out of players, coaches, and former players.
 Last Friday, St. Cecilia got Crofton again, in the C-2 semifinals.
 And Saturday, the Hawkettes outlasted Ponca — another STC historical foe — for their second consecutive title.
 Again, I felt jubilation. I wanted to scream “Back-to-back!” and gallup through Pinnacle Bank Arena with them.
 I watched more than half of STC’s games this season. I saw the Hawkettes at some of their lowest points, and of course, their highest.
 But see, when you’re a journalist, you can’t have favorites. You can’t cheer or groan from press row. Although I’m human, too, and trust me, I let comments slip out here and there.
 And while I don’t think it’s appropriate to act certain ways in the role I possess, I do think it’s okay to want the teams you cover to do well.
 Or else what fun is it to just go through the motions and not care one way or the other?
 Did I complain that I had to sit around all day because the championship didn’t tip off until close to 9 p.m. on a Saturday night? Yes, probably like a few or more of you, I did.
 But did I feel lucky, and was I excited to be there? Absolutely.
 No, you won’t see me smiling, or running on to the court, or cutting down the net with the team when the buzzer sounds.
 But, when one of our area teams wins — and in each of my three years a girl’s team has, just sayin’ — I can’t help but feel like a champion, too.
 It’s special to watch that team you’ve journeyed with complete their goal.
 Earlier Saturday, as I was walking into Noodles & Co. for lunch, I heard pounding on the window as I approached the door.
 I looked to my left and, coincidentally, there was St. Cecilia’s team, smiling and waving.
 It made me smile. It made me feel a small part of them. That they knew me, and, of course, I knew them.
 It was a reminder to me that you’ve got to enjoy the little things, because sometimes they make it all worth it.
