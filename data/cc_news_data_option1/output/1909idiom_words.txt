 Madison Regan of Springfield isn't one of the more than 965,000 Illinoisans who have qualified for unemployment benefits since the week ending March 21 when the state's stay-at-home order took effect to slow the novel coronavirus spread.
 But she has been out of work since March 12.
 Regan owns Just the Basics Mobile Bar, catering to a variety of events like weddings, corporate parties, baby showers and more, which have all been paused due to social distancing guidelines.
 She applied for benefits and was denied because she's a sole proprietor, but that at least put her in line for the highly anticipated federally-funded Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program that offers unemployment benefits for 1099 workers, who don't normally qualify for benefits.
 As the PUA program went live Monday in Illinois, the state has processed more than 50,000 of those claims, but they're not included in 72,671 additional Illinoisans who filed initial claims in the week ending May 9 which was a piece of the 2.9 million more Americans who filed claims last week.
