Kris Holtham, who works as a meat manager for Kroger in Lansing, Mich., and has been employed by the company for 35 years, says that getting customers to wear masks has become difficult.


  "Masks have become a political war," Holtham said. "The employees are downright scared and afraid to ask someone to put on a mask. ... I see hundreds of people a day without a mask. We are sitting ducks for the virus."


  Holtham recounted a story where she asked a customer to put on a mask for the sake of the workers and the customer responded with, "I don't give a damn about your health."

Those who want to adopt can meet the cats in person and complete adoption paperwork online or by calling the shelter.
 The public hasn't been allowed inside the shelter since Gov. Eric Holcomb placed statewide restrictions on various types of businesses, so staff have started trying new ways to find homes for animals, and to progress into reopening in a safe and practical manner.
 They haven't been able to accept owner-surrenders or animals that aren't an emergency situation, and the only adoptions they've done are to people who were already fostering a pet and decided to adopt them.
 If someone has contacted the shelter to take their pet, "we are advising if people are able to, to keep them until we can reopen," Snider said. "And giving them resources to help them, different lost and found pages, Facebook pages."
 The shelter also now has four dogs , which are not at Feeder's Supply.

Everyone looks forward to tomatoes. We can't wait for the peaches and corn. Some of us even get excited about zucchini. But who gets pumped for kohlrabi? Anyone?      It doesn't help that a kohlrabi plant looks like a snake that recently swallowed a beach ball. The edible part is the swollen section of stem, which tastes like the part of broccoli most people throw away.      Kohlrabi is perhaps most popular with farmers who are looking for some early season variety in their market displays, CSA boxes or farm stands. Thus, kohlrabi finds its way into the fridge and lurks there, for weeks or longer, never spoiling, never letting you off the hook.      If you take the time to peel one you will be rewarded with a crisp, watery bite and a faint hint of spice, like a cross between jicama and a mild radish.      Sliced thickly on a veggie platter next to some dip, kohlrabi may never get a second chance. Sliced thinly or shredded, kohlrabi clings to sauce the way angel hair pasta does, which opens up many possibilities.      My favorite way to use shredded kohlrabi is in som tum, a green papaya salad that is one of the world's favorite Thai dishes. Green papaya are scarce in my parts, and kohlrabi so available I use it instead, along with shredded carrots. Salty, sweet, spicy, acidic, with a bitter garlic pungency and full of umami, this salad has something for every taste bud.      When I was in Bangkok I spent some time seeking out the best som tum I could find, a mission that took me to a certain outdoor market on the edge of the city. I found my way to the section where stall after stall serves nothing but som tum. I bowed to a man with a bandana on his head.      The "som" in som tum refers to its sour taste, while the "tum" mimics the sound of the pounding of a pestle into a mortar. I'm not sure what I told this gentleman, or what he heard me say, but he nodded and smiled. Then he put a handful of small, living crabs into a tall wooden bowl, and started pounding. His heavy wooden pestle went "tum tum tum" on those crabs until they were a paste, to which he added spices and pounded some more. Then he ladled in some fish sauce, generously -- the way you would want someone to add hot fudge to your ice cream.      The som tum maker swapped his pestle for a pair of wooden forks and added shredded green papaya, herbs and, for good measure, more fish sauce. He stirred it all together, scooped the salad into a paper bowl, and handed it to me.      It was a bit fishy, and hot enough to burn a hole in the sun, but the rich array of flavors was dazzling. The beauty of this dish is that it balances flavors so intense, each one would be too overpowering on its own. But together they neutralize each other, like a mutually assured destruction.      I respected that som tum, but between the fish sauce, high heat and mashed up crabs I was in over my head. I didn't take too many bites, but in looking into that abyss I learned something, and returned to my quarters thrilled with my discovery.      Kohlrabi som tum can be an adventure, too, if less cathartic. I call it kohl som, which translates to something like "Thai-style sour kohlrabi."      Kohl Som   • 1 baseball-sized kohlrabi, peeled and grated or shredded (about 3 cups)   • 1 large handful cherry tomatoes, sliced into halves or quarters   • 1 medium carrot, grated (about 1 cup)   • 1 medium-sized clove garlic, pressed or grated   • ½ teaspoon salt   • 1 or more tablespoons fish sauce   • Juice of 1 lime (or 3 tablespoons lime juice)   • Chile flakes, to taste   • Up to 1 tablespoon brown sugar   • 2 green onions, chopped   • ½ cup chopped cilantro (or parsley)   • Optional garnish: 2 tablespoons peanuts, dry roasted in a pan   • Sliced jalapenos, optional      Combine the kohlrabi, carrot, tomatoes, garlic and salt in a mixing bowl. Give the tomatoes a squeeze to crush them a little. Set aside.      Combine the fish sauce, lime juice, sugar and chile flakes, and stir until the brown sugar is fully dissolved. Add this sauce and the green onions, cilantro and jalapenos, if using, to the mixing bowl. Toss the salad in the dressing, a little roughly to crush the tomatoes a bit more, and garnish with the peanuts.

The problem, Deluard suggests, is that ESG investing, intentionally or otherwise, rewards exactly the corporate behavior that is creating alarm. Companies with few buildings, few formal employees and a light carbon footprint tend to show up well on ESG screens. But allocating capital to them leads to a deepening of inequality, and intensifying the problem of under- unemployment. On the face of it, they aren’t the companies that should be receiving capital if employment is to recover swiftly. If investors want to behave with the interests of “stakeholders” rather than “shareholders” in mind, and that is surely central to the ESG philosophy, then their current approach is directly counter-productive. No good turn goes unpunished.

SPRINGFIELD -- A new state budget will hold state spending essentially flat next year while also borrowing as much as $5 billion from the federal government to keep state operations going during the COVID-19 pandemic.
   
 The House Executive Committee gave approval to parts of the budget Friday, one of the final major issues that must be addressed by the General Assembly during its abbreviated session this week.
   
 House Majority Leader Greg Harris, D-Chicago, said the budget is an attempt "to pick the best of a bunch of bad options."
   
 Harris said three alternatives were examined by budget negotiators. One was a 35% across the board cut to every spending line in the budget. Harris said that would have "decimated" a wide variety of state services, including human services that are under increased pressure to help people who have been harmed during the pandemic.
   
 "That was something we did not want to do," he said.
   
 Harris said some practices used in previous financial crises were also rejected, such as giving the governor a lump-sum budget or shorting payments to pension system to free up money to use on state operations.
   
 The third option was the one adopted that keeps state spending basically flat and keeping open the option of borrowing from the federal government to help maintain operations while state revenues are expected to plummet.
   
 "We're dealing with a time of unprecedented crisis for our state, both human and financial," Harris said. "Many of the items and facts we need to do effective budget making we do not know now. We are hoping the actions we are taking are not ones that trigger additional negative scrutiny from the financial rating agencies because we are attempting to be responsible and pay all of our pension obligations and all of our debt service."
   
 Because of all of the uncertainties, Gov. JB Pritzker will be given expanded authority to move money around in the budget and hold money in reserve in order to address spending needs. However, he will also have to deliver regular reports to the General Assembly about what budget actions he is taking. Also, a bi-partisan panel of legislators is being established to also keep an eye on what the governor is doing to manage the budget.
   
 The state could borrow up to $5 billion under a federal program to help pay for state operations. Harris said the amount could depend on how much money Congress decides to send to the states to help cover their losses because of the pandemic. At this point, the amount of that potential aid is not known. The more federal aid that comes to the state, the less that would have to be borrowed. Harris said there are discussions underway that would allow states to repay those loans over 30 years.
   
 Holding spending basically flat means K-12 schools will not be getting a further increase next year under the revised school funding formula. When the new formula was installed, schools were supposed to see steady increases in general state aid for a decade at which time the formula would be fully implemented.
   
 The flat spending plan also means local governments will not see a larger share of state tax collections from the Local Government Distributive Fund. Municipalities have complained that for years they've been given less money from the fund than they are supposed to receive, putting a strain on their budgets.
   
 The executive committee also approved renewal of the hospital assessment program that uses a fee levied on hospital bed usage to pry additional Medicaid money from Washington. The renewed program is expected to get another $400 million in reimbursements.
   
 Both bills now go to the full House for a vote. They must also still be approved by the Senate.
