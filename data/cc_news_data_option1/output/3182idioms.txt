For the first time in more than 30 years, Kim Dameron started a preseason football practice not coaching college players.
   
 The first-year Southside coach, though, doesn't see a huge difference in his return to the high school ranks for the first time since the mid-1980s as the Mavericks officially began preseason practices last week.
   
 "I was raised by a high school coach, so that's all I knew growing up, and so I'm used to being in a school setting," Dameron said. "I've really enjoyed it and I've really enjoyed this staff; I tell you what, it's a really good group of guys and they're really good football coaches."
   
 Dameron added that the eagerness shown by his new players to improve and get better is similar to what he was used to seeing in college.
   
 "I like their enthusiasm; they're no different really than college kids," Dameron said. "You have certain ones that it really means a lot to; you've got certain ones that it's maybe not as important to; you've got some that are really, really good; you've got some that are just learning and in the developmental stage. It's not that much different than coaching in college once you're out there on the grass.
   
 "It's football, and the same thing, too, with the kids as far as the relationship with kids, it's just they're a little bit younger. I'm used to dealing with 18 to 22 year olds and now I'm dealing with 15 to 18 year olds."
   
 Dameron has also had to navigate the new normal, with the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
   
 That hit home as one of the Maverick players tested positive for the virus last week and is in quarantine.
   
 But Dameron pointed out that the virus wasn't contacted by the player in practice and subsequently carried over to other players, which has allowed the Mavericks to continue to conduct practice.
   
 "All of the guidelines that (the Arkansas Department of Health has) given us, we've tried to follow them to the letter, and that has allowed us to keep practicing even with a positive," Dameron said. "And we're not the only school in the state that's had positive kids, so I'm sure that's what all the state schools are doing is following those guidelines so they can continue to practice."
   
 There's something else Dameron has carried over from his years of coaching college ball, and that is not to go heavy on contact drills in practice
   
 "I practice very similar to the way we practiced in college; we're not tackling to the ground very often, we're not that type of stuff," Dameron said. "We just don't do that much; we do a lot of fundamental work, we do a lot of things against each other and all that, and we can get better without live tackling.
   
 "Now if everything stays on schedule, Saturday (when the team holds an intra- squad scrimmage) we'll do some live tackling and then Tuesday evening, we'll have a scrimmage with Alma. If things stay on track, hopefully we'll be able to do that."
   
 And without a doubt, Dameron is relying on several experienced players, who have definitely caught the coach's attention in practice.
   
 "Some of the kids from last year, starting with the defense and obviously (senior lineman) Shawn Rogers; everybody knows about Shawn," Dameron said. "(Senior middle linebacker) Landen Chaffey is a really good player and can run.
   
 "Then (senior defensive back) Eli Lyles has played and he's going to have to play on both sides of the ball. He'll play some slot, he'll play some running back, he'll play some safety. He's been impressive with his ability to learn, and so he's doing well."
   
 On the offensive side, Dameron is relying on returning players like senior lineman Marlon Briggs, but also getting some newer players into the mix.
   
 "The biggest thing right now is getting the young kids like Dmitri Lloyd (a junior who can play both running back and tight end) and some other guys like that; (senior Jackson) Riddle, who hadn't played a ton as far as the backfield is concerned," Dameron said.
   
 "Then with some young receivers, we didn't have (senior) Connor Austin for a while and so he's back and he's played quite a bit in the past and he's an explosive kid; he can get downfield."
   
 Quarterback is also a position that is wide open, and a starter may not be named until right before the Mavericks' season opener Aug. 27 at Northside. Those vying for the role include senior Parker Wehunt and junior Luke Wyatt, both of whom saw action last season, along with David Sorg, a sophomore.
   
 "I'm kind of holding judgment; I just want to see them continue to get better and not really try to make a huge decision right now, but we will before the season starts," Dameron said. "We'll have a starter and we'll know, but I can foresee us playing two guys at quarterback on a regular basis.
   
 "And really all of them, especially the two that played last year, also have the ability to play other positions on offense, and so you never know; we may have three quarterbacks on the field at the same time so we'll be trying to keep people guessing."

JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) - American Civil Liberties Union and Mississippi Center for Justice are suing over absentee ballots in Mississippi.They hope to make absentee balloting more accessible in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.The lawsuit is filed on behalf of several Mississipians who wish to use absentee voting to avoid going to the polls for fear of contracting the virus.The suit wants the clause that anyone with a “temporary physical disability” to vote in Mississippi account for anyone who wishes to avoid voting in person due to the pandemic.“Over the last month, Mississippi has proven to be a consistent COVID-19 hot spot with the numbers of infections and deaths increasing, not decreasing,” Mississippi Center for Justice President and CEO Vangela M. Wade said. “Any requirement that citizens gather in polling places to cast their ballots would show a callous disregard for the health of our communities that would likely chill the voting process resulting in constructive disenfranchisement of thousands.”Copyright 2020 WLBT.

When more than 1 million North Carolina students resume the school year from home on Monday to avoid COVID-19, many of their teachers will still be at school, and some of the teachers are worried about catching the disease there.
   
 Districts have asked -- and in some cases required -- teachers to be physically present at schools when classes start. This includes many of the more than 60 districts starting under remote instruction to deter the spread of the coronavirus.
   
 School district leaders said the policy promotes consistency for students.
   
 Some educators argue against the policy. They said it shows a lack of trust in them and forces teachers to weigh job security against health risks.
   
 "When it comes down to it, teachers are professionals that can be trusted to do that job effectively and consistently, even from home," said Paula Dinga, a third-grade teacher in Buncombe County Schools and president of the Buncombe County Association of Educators.
   
 After COVID-19 concerns closed school buildings in March, North Carolina teachers concluded the school year from home. They relied heavily on virtual platforms like Google Classroom and Canvas, as well as physical take-home packets, to teach from afar.
   
 As thousands of teachers reentered buildings this week to prepare for the school year, districts implemented safety protocols like temperature checks, mask mandates and enhanced cleanings. Despite these precautions, some teachers said being at school will change how they conduct their lives outside of work.
   
 'They don't want to rock the boat'
   
 After returning to her school, Tara O'Loughlin, who teaches art in Haywood County Schools, stopped seeing her father because he was recently diagnosed with cancer. The Centers for Disease Control says cancer patients, particularly ones whose immune systems have been suppressed by chemotherapy, have an increased fatality risk if they contract COVID-19.
   
 "I would be apprehensive to help out with family stuff," said O'Loughlin, who also serves as president of the Haywood County Association of Educators. "Even though the kids aren't there, it's still like 60-plus teachers that are in a school, with oftentimes antiquated ventilation systems."
   
 As is typical in other districts, Haywood County allows teachers to request exceptions from teaching in buildings, with accommodations for medical or personal reasons decided on a case-by-case basis. O'Loughlin said her principal is willing to work with her so she can care for her father.
   
 She hoped the district would in general allow teachers to work from home and arrange for those who need to work from school to do so.
   
 "If there were teachers that maybe did have [internet] connection issues or needed more accountability, I would love that they be brought in on a person- to-person basis rather than staff at a whole," O'Loughlin said.
   
 Loughlin and Dinga said they know coworkers who are afraid to request exceptions, even if health conditions leave them more vulnerable to COVID-19 symptoms.
   
 "It just makes me sad to see people putting themselves at risk because they don't want to rock the boat," Loughlin said.
   
 Tamika Walker Kelly is president of the North Carolina Association of Educators, the largest teacher advocacy organization in the state. She said a mandate to have staff physically be in buildings, "feels troubling, especially when it is framed in the manner of professionalism."
   
 "Professionalism doesn't limit itself to being physically present in a building and this requirement undermines the relationship of trust between educators and school districts," she said.
   
 Districts say location matters
   
 District representatives there are advantages to have the teachers back in the buildings. For example, they said certain courses like chemistry benefit from having teachers in labs.
   
 "The physical classroom best models the learning environment that students will return to," wrote Scott Rhodes, chief human resources officer at Henderson County Public Schools. "Additionally, the internet bandwidth and instructional materials on hand in a school environment ensure teachers have access to the resources needed for highly-engaged student learning."
   
 Alamance-Burlington School System Public Information Officer Jenny Faulkner wrote that "having staff in buildings will help us develop routines and guidelines that will be effective when students begin to return."
   
 The district thinks students will be more comfortable returning to classrooms if they regularly see their classrooms beforehand, Faulkner said, even if it's through a screen. The Alamance-Burlington schools offer flexible work placements at the start of the year for staff managing child care or family and personal health concerns, he said.
   
 Parent and staff surveys at Asheville City Schools showed students were "more engaged when they are receiving whole class sessions from a classroom setting," said district spokesperson Ashley-Michelle Thublin.
   
 And in the surrounding Buncombe County Schools, associate superintendent Susanne Swanger said coming to school will help educators both better access resources and collaborate with coworkers in small professional learning communities.
   
 New Hanover County Schools did not respond to requests for comment on their teaching policy. Amanda White, a chemistry teacher in the district, said teachers were expected to be present in classrooms for virtual teaching.
   
 Cumberland County Schools encourages staff to physically report to their work locations, but Carol Stubbs, president of the Cumberland County Association of Educators, doesn't sense her fellow educators feel overly pressured to show up if it's not best for them.
   
 "Those who want to stay home stay home," she said. "And a lot of them want to (come to school buildings) because they can get more done."
   
 Some educators disagree that lectures from school enhance the learning the students will get through their computer screens.
   
 "With the way our platforms are designed and the digital tools that our teachers are using, I don't see much difference," said Angie Cathcart, a digital lead teacher at Asheville Middle School.
