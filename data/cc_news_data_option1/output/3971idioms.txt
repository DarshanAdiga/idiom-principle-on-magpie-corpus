Betty Louise Otto Betty Louise Otto passed away serenely on September 28th, 2020. Betty was born in Salinas on November 12, 1924. She was proud of her years and enjoyed sharing stories of her adventurous life. Betty was the daughter of Vera and Albert Underwood, and she is preceded in death by her husband Art and daughter Barbara. Surviving Betty is her son, Gary (Lisa), her grandchildren Brandon (Moye) and Alicia (Garrett) and four loving grandchildren. After business school, Betty used her skills as a stenographer and administrative assistant with the U.S. Immigration Service and the Alameda Naval Air Station. During their over 50-year marriage, Betty and Art were partners in adventure. They loved to travel, fish, complete woodworking and sewing projects, and take their children on backpacking trips all over the west. Betty and Art trained dogs with the Redwood Retriever Club, and were active members of the Humboldt Historical Society. We will remember Mom's spunk and courage to try new things, as well as her great laugh. You may have seen Betty "tootling around" Santa Rosa in her 5-speed car, her Chihuahua, Pepy, by her side in his car seat. Mom was very involved with the Visual Aids team in Oakmont, creating books for blind children all over the world. We appreciate the amazing care provided by Helen, Joel, Lisa, and all of the staff at Serenity House residential care. They provided her a lovely home and became part of mom's family during her final months. In addition, we are grateful for the expert care provided to mom and us by Heartland Hospice. We would like to thank Mom's lifetime friends Mary and Lani for their thoughtful support and friendship. In honor of Betty, contributions can be made to the Humboldt Botanical Gardens in Eureka, CA.

"Asian giant hornets this time of year start going into what we call the slaughter phase," said Sven-Erik Spichiger, a department entomologist. "They will visit apiaries, basically mark a hive, attack it in force, removing every bee from the hive, decapitating them, killing all of the workers and then spending the next few days harvesting the brood and the pupae out of the hive as a food source."
 During a news conference on Facebook on Friday, Spichiger said the department believes it's dealing with a nest and that it's critical to find it and destroy it before the slaughter phase or new nests are made.
 Spichiger said the first of the six hornets was captured on Sept. 21 east of Blaine, in northeastern Whatcom County, by a family after the hornet repeatedly visited a paper wasp nest in the eaves of their home.
 The family then decided to deploy a citizen trap and caught a second one, said Spichiger. Another department entomologist, Chris Looney, met with the landowner and was able to catch a third one alive in his net while they were talking.
 WSDA tried to glue a radio tag on the live hornet, but the glue failed, got on the hornet's wings and prevented it from flying home and leading scientists to its nest, Spichiger said.
 Karla Sapp, WSDA spokesperson, found the fourth hornet dead in a street lamp. The fifth was caught in a "perfect" doorbell camera picture that shows the insect's large yellow head, and the sixth was reported by a person who found it dead on a porch, Spichiger said.
 He said the department will be checking its live traps daily and is using a number of approaches to find the Asian giant hornets, including the use of lure hives that have been placed in Birch Bay -- where the first Asian giant hornet to be trapped in Washington state was found in July -- Custer and Blaine.
 The Asian giant hornet, the world's largest at 2 inches, can decimate entire hives of honeybees needed for pollination and deliver painful stings to humans. As many as 50 people die each year from their stings in Japan.

 # Faith enables us to build bridges to others
 Times-News
 As an advocate for building bridges throughout various components of our community, I felt obligated and was encouraged by many brothers and sisters to write about this topic
 Communities are like cities and towns in our state. They are not always naturally connected. They require roads and highways to connect them together. Bigger cities are usually better connected because you will find more than one or two highways, you will find state routes. That is why people love living there and find plenty of resources to use and utilize. On the other hand, small towns and villages will be stuck with one small or minor access road that connects them to the next bigger town. You will not fine many resources in those towns, and people must put in the extra effort to go find the resources elsewhere. Many of those people end up leaving those town, and that leads to less resources and towns dying.
 In our communities, the majority part of the population, those who have resources, those who have the means, are like big, well-connected cities, while the minorities and less able residents are like the small and isolated towns. Religion and faith can be the bridge builders who can connect those small towns or groups, and make of them a well-resourced entity that helps its own and supports others.
 Faith does not preach isolation, or separation from our communities, but it does not force it. While it is our choice to build bridges or not, not doing so will make us weaker and isolated. We all need to have our backs supported by allies. We need to have the security and power to get things done (this includes things that we need to survive and things that we need to prosper).
 I have seen many bright and great examples in Burlington of building bridges between various parts of our community. Those were great things, but there is a lot more to be done. We are in crisis because of the COVID-19 epidemic, we still have a long way to go on finding a cure to rid us of that virus, and also while we are at, we need to find the cure for racism and hate. We need to learn how to respect the fact that while we are uniquely different, we are together in this community and life. We need to get rid of the huge inheritance of hate and disrespect, and replace that with tolerance, acceptance and even collaboration with others.
 Life in a community is not and should not be about who controls what and how many people we have in power or government. It should be about how to bring resources, and resolve any issue that anyone living here has. We have poverty issues, homelessness, drug abuse, bullying as well as limitations of the resources that are available for our schools. Each one of those issues needs a community united to bring solutions and you cannot do that without agreeing first that we cannot be racists or haters. We need to embody the role of prophets and spread love and tolerance so people can put their hands and efforts together to resolve most, if not all, problems facing our community.
 I admire and respect everyone who is trying to make a difference, from all races, faiths and backgrounds. To them, I say thank you, but we need a lot more. We need to stop working in bubbles isolated from other people who are trying to do good. We need a lot done, and we need to do it together.
 On another note, since this is election season, my piece of advice is that if we need to change, then we need to change ourselves and go out and vote. We need to respect the others who are out there seeking change. We all should agree that bullying and intimidation of the other is not a victory for what we stand for, it is a proof that we are not principled and true to what we stand for. God created us in different skin colors and shapes, but the hearts inside are always pumping red blood. The outside differences are merely a tool so we can work on knowing the others around us. They were never there because we are better or superior. When we die, we all get buried in the ground and go back to dirt. I never heard about the ground rejecting a corpse because of its being from a certain race or being poor. So why we are not trying to be as kind and tolerant as the earth is to us.
 Please go out and vote and make yourself known in a respectful way. Please make our town shine as a place that is uniquely positive, tolerant and diverse.

Debra Baker Powell July 20, 1951 - October 2, 2020 On Friday, October 2, 2020, Debra B. Powell passed away in Charlottesville, VA at the age of 69 from complications related to her courageous battle with cancer. Debra was born on July 20, 1951 in Alamogordo, New Mexico and moved with her family to Maryland at an early age. Following her graduation from The University of Maryland, Debra resided for 35 years in the Washington, DC area, where she raised her son and worked in business and federal government consulting. Seeking a change of pace and scenery, she relocated to Charlottesville, VA and, together with her sister, opened Partridge and Grace Designs, a custom framing studio. It was during this time that Debra was remarried, her husband being a source of great joy and happiness. Debra was an avid reader, gifted writer, critical thinker and lifelong learner. She could engage deeply on a wide range of topics and was clear and confident in her beliefs. She was highly creative, and her pursuits included fine art, interior design, gardening and classic cooking. Hand painted cards often adorned her exquisitely wrapped Christmas packages. She loved to travel, especially throughout Europe, but equally relished an evening glass of wine at home. Her selflessness was evident in the compassionate care she provided to numerous family members during their times of need. Above all else, Debra was a loving wife, devoted mother, caring grandmother and a thoughtful friend. She was preceded in death by her parents Raymond and Patricia Baker of Rockville, MD, her sister Denise Crumpler of Charlottesville, VA and her longtime companion Morris T. Warner Jr. of Staunton, VA. Debra is survived by her husband of seven years, Greg Powe of Charlottesville, VA; her son and his wife Wesley and Kathryn Powell of Bethesda, MD; her brothers David Baker of Ocean View, DE and Danny Baker of Upper Marlboro, MD; her granddaughters Reagan and Elizabeth Powell, also of Bethesda, MD and her first husband Richard Powell of White Stone, VA. A Celebration of Life gathering for family and friends will be planned at a later date. In lieu of flowers, the family asks that donations be made to The Hospice of the Piedmont in Charlottesville, VA.

This week's 50-for-50 profile Scott Fry is a man with too much time on his hands right now.
 As a football player and then a coach for closing in on four decades, Scott is used to having his nose in a playbook or watching endless loops of game film at this time of the year. But things are different right now for the 52-year- old. Plymouth South's athletic director for 16 years now, Scott stepped down as football coach at the end of the 2019 season in order to spend more time with his family.
 "My son Cooper is at the age when he's getting into sports and I want to be there and be involved," Scott said. "I've had the chance to coach other people's children for many years and I don't want to miss the chance to coach my own. These are the times that I do not want to miss."
 Fry was ready to scratch his coaching itch this fall as the defensive coordinator for Plymouth South on new Head Coach Darren Fruzzetti's staff, but that was put on hold when football was moved to the new Fall II season because of COVID-19 precautions. That season will now start at the end of February.
 "Yeah, it's a little different right now. It feels kind of weird not being on the football field every afternoon after school or studying up and researching our next opponent," Scott said earlier this week. "I think it will really sink in when we start practicing again during the new Fall II season."
 For as long as Scott can remember he has been around a football field. He started playing in the town's youth program and quickly found that he had some talent for the game that would lead him to star first at Plymouth-Carver and then eventually for Springfield College.
 "As I got older I realized that coaching was something that I wanted to get into once my playing days were over. It seemed like a natural progression for me after having so many great youth coaches growing up and then Paul Coffin as well as Carl Freyermuth once I got to the high school," Scott explained. "They all had a big influence on me as I was growing up."
 He took to the early coaching very well and he was ready to contribute right away when he got to high school. The Plymouth-Carver football program was thriving in the 1980s with more than 100 players in the program each year, but Scott quickly carved out a spot for himself as a sophomore starter on both sides of the football, at linebacker and fullback.
 "The program was having a lot of success at the time. I think we lost three games in the four years I played for Plymouth-Carver," Scott remembered fondly. "There were some talented players on the team like Paul Shea, Dave Enos, Cabby Brini and Jack Quinlan, and we all just seemed to jell together at the right time."
 Fry was one of those talented pieces to the overall puzzle, according to Freyermuth, his high school head football coach.
 "Scott always had great football instincts and he was very mature for his age which allowed him to step in and start as a sophomore at linebacker," Freyermuth said. "He would throw himself into the playbook and the scouting reports more than anyone I've ever seen. He knew those reports better than I did and I was the head coach of the team. He knew his responsibilities on every play and he also knew what everyone else was supposed to be.
 "Even back then Scott was a student of the game and his work ethic was far above and beyond what you'd expect in a player."
 Scott was on P-C's freshman football squad his first year in 1983 and he watched the varsity team put together an undefeated season but they missed moving on to play for a state championship by a hair.
 But 1984 would be a different story.
 Plymouth-Carver rolled to their second Old Colony League title in a row. With Scott moving in as a starting outside linebacker the Blue Eagles made it over the final hurdle and got to the Division 2 state title game, beating Methuen, 18-14, for the program's first state championship.
 "Scott was a big reason we won that game," Freyermuth said. "Methuen had a good drive going deep in our territory when Scott stopped it with a huge interception. It was the defensive play of the game for us."
 Scott was determined to play in college and he found the right fit for football and a future teaching career at Springfield College. "(Springfield coaches) Mike DeLong and Jack Holick were both huge influences on me," Scott said.
 Fry remained with Springfield football program after graduating as a graduate assistant and had coaching stops at Princeton, Maine Maritime, Silver Lake and Plymouth North before taking over as head coach of the Plymouth South program, a position he held for 16 years until stepping down in January.
 During his tenure as head coach he led the Panthers to two Super Bowl appearances in 2013 and then again in 2019. Brendan Harty was a senior captain and two-way starting lineman on the South '13 team that lost in the state finals to Tewksbury.
 "What I remember about that that time is how well Coach Fry had us prepared for every game," Harty said. "So many players from that team went on to play in college and a lot of that was because of the way Scott prepared us for every game. He allowed us to get the most out of all of our talent."
 Plymouth South was back at the Super Bowl again last fall, losing to a very good Methuen High squad at Gillette Stadium in the championship game.
 While he's stepped down as head football coach, Scott is still the athletic director at Plymouth South and he has no plans of moving away from that spot anytime soon.
 "I really enjoy the job of athletic director. You always have challenges like EEE, heat index and now COVID-19 precautions to deal with, but those are the kind of things that go along with the job," Scott said. "I like that I'm still involved in coaching but now it's more along the lines of coaching the coaches.
 "I love talking with coaches and seeing how they go about working with the kids and doing their job."
 Former Plymouth South Athletic Director Karl Braun said Scott is an example of "good things happening to good people."
 "When I was the athletic director Scott shadowed me for more than a year to soak in all that he could about the job. He wanted to coach and do the AD job because he likes helping kids and that's something that hasn't stopped to this day," Braun said. "There are no short cuts with Scott. He does things the right way and he's always put the best interests of the kids first. Always."

Even after canceling the annual infield concert and festivities, the Maryland Jockey Club and Stronach Group that owns Pimlico hoped back in the spring that moving the race to the fall would allow for the possibility of having fans.

If the aesthetic is your preference, I’ve always loved the Harris gin bottle, (£37, Harris Distillery), and far from just a pretty face, the gin includes hand-harvested sugar kelp as a botanical, which I find less on the nose figuratively than gold, but at least more on the nose aromatically.

 # Saints player's positive COVID test leaves Sunday's Lions game up in the air
 Justin Rogers
 The Detroit News
 View Comments
 Hours after New England Patriots quarterback Cam Newton tested positive for the COVID-19 virus Saturday afternoon, forcing the NFL to postpone this weekend’s game between the Patriots and Kansas City Chiefs, the Detroit Lions and New Orleans Saints are faced with a similar dilemma after multiple outlets have reported Saints fullback Michael Burton also tested positive on Saturday.
 As part of protocols put in place after Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford had a false-positive test this summer, Burton is being re-tested to determine if his own result is a false-positive. The team is also testing several players in close contact with Burton on the flight to Detroit, including star running back Alvin Kamara.
 With the news breaking late Saturday, it’s still unclear what it means for the status of Sunday’s game between the two teams. But if Burton is confirmed to have the virus, it will almost certainly lead to a postponement similar to the league’s decision with the Chiefs and Saints to ensure any potential spread is contained.

 That game is currently slated to be played either Monday or Tuesday this week, but hinges on there being no addition spread.
 Earlier this week, the league had to postpone its first game due to the virus after the Tennessee Titans experienced an outbreak. Over the past 10 days, the organization has had 16 positive cases, including eight players. The team has reported new cases each of the past five days, including Saturday.
 The Titans’ opponent last weekend, the Minnesota Vikings, also had to temporarily shut down their facilities, but after no positive tests for their franchise, they remain on track to play the Houston Texans on Sunday.
 If the Lions and Saints are faced with a longer delay, similar to the Titans, the NFL will need to quickly come up with an alternative plan to reschedule the game. The Lions are scheduled to be on their bye next week, while the Saints have their bye a week later.

He knows the policy and the key players, plus spent four years as Indiana’s governor so has experience in handling executive power. That will avoid the situation that happened in Britain when Boris Johnson was in intensive care and, critics said, there was a lack of clarity about who was in charge and how they would be kept in the loop with Covid-19 planning.
