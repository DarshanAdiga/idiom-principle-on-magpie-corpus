As disinformation related to COVID-19 is spreading faster than the virus itself, micro -blogging platform Twitter feels that its work has never been more critical and its service has never been in higher demand than ever before globally, including in India.
 The power of a uniquely open service during a public health emergency is crystal clear, says Mahima Kaul, Director, Public Policy, India and South Asia at Twitter, adding that they are continuing to review the rules in the context of COVID-19 and considering ways in which they may need to evolve to account for new behaviours.
 Since introducing its updated policies on March 18, Twitter has removed more than 2,400 tweets containing misleading and potentially harmful content.
 "Our automated systems have challenged more than 3.4 million accounts targeting manipulative discussions around COVID-19. We will continue to use both technology and our teams to help us identify and stop spammy behaviour and accounts," Kaul told IANS.
 Twitter has received positive response to its efforts in curbing COVID-19 related fake news and misinformation in India.
 The efforts include an events page dedicated to COVID-19 information called "Coronavirus Tweets from Indian authorities", which is essentially a timeline of tweets from verified Indian officials and bodies such as Prime Minister Narendra Modi (@narendramodi), Health Minister Harsh Vardhan (@drharshvardhan), the official Citizen Engagement Platform of the Government of Indian (@mygovindia, Press Information Bureau (@PIB_India) and other state and Central ministers, as well as public health agencies.
 "Every account holder in India can see this page on the top of their home timeline. If someone has their settings set to Hindi, then they will see the same page with Hindi Tweets. The timeline also lets people track developments around the latest social distancing and healthcare information," informed Kaul.
 The platform recently onboarded the Ministry of Health &amp; Family Welfare (@MoHFW_INDIA) to Twitter Seva to help Indians with a speedy resolution to their health-related queries.
 "This public service is allowing the Ministry to communicate effectively and at scale with the public, especially in crisis situations like the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The dedicated account @CovidIndiaSeva establishes a direct channel between the Government and citizens to provide access to authoritative health and public information," Kaul elaborated.
 She said that Twitter India is regularly working with trusted partners, including public health authorities, researchers, NGOs, and governments to keep improving its fight against COVID-19.
 "To tackle misinformation related to COVID-19, we have broadened our definition of harm and expanded our safety rules to address content that goes directly against guidance from authoritative sources with the intent to influence people into acting against recommended guidance," said Kaul.
 The company has also increased its use of machine learning and automation to take a wide range of actions on potentially abusive and manipulative content.
 "Additionally, we're continuing to review and require the removal of Tweets that do not follow the Twitter Rules - half of which we catch before they're ever reported to us. We continue to remain vigilant," Kaul added.
 Twitter is releasing a new endpoint into Twitter Developer Labs to enable approved developers and researchers to study the public conversation about COVID-19 in real-time.
 Tweets by people on the service will be made available to researchers and developers for free.
 According to Kaul, the data will help research the spread of the disease, understand the spread of misinformation, crisis management, emergency response, and communication within communities.
 "As we've said on many occasions, our approach to protecting the public conversation is never static. That's particularly relevant in these unprecedented times. We intend to review our thinking daily and will ensure we're sharing updates on any new clarifications to our rules or major changes to how we're enforcing them," Kaul told IANS.

OTTAWA COUNTY -- The ongoing coronavirus pandemic has created issues with access to food for many.
   
 As more individuals deal with job loss, being able to get nutritious food can be difficult. In Ottawa County, groups are working to ensure that residents have paths to a healthy and sustainable diet.
   
 Ottawa Food partners with several agencies to assist food insecure individuals. Lisa Uganski, coordinator for Ottawa Food, said agencies across the county are working to ensure residents have access to healthy food during the pandemic.
   
 "There's definitely been an increase in need and families who are going through food insecurity," Uganski said.
   
 More than 1.3 million people in Michigan have filed for unemployment benefits since March 15.
   
 While local school districts have been conducting meal distributions for families with children that qualify for free and reduced lunch, other individuals who have lost jobs during the pandemic may not qualify.
   
 Uganski said that isolated seniors and migrant families may also have difficulties accessing healthy and culturally appropriate foods.
   
 Meal distribution services have also adapted to the pandemic, with many offering curbside pickup to avoid the spread of COVID-19, Uganski said.
   
 Groups like Kids Food Basket, Community Action House, Age Well, Feeding America of West Michigan and various others are continuing food distribution services to reduce food insecurity during the pandemic.
   
 Individuals who are looking for food assistance can dial 211 or visit call-211.org to receive information about mobile food pantries, meal pickups and other services.
   
 Care Ottawa County, which was established in light of the pandemic, also distributes grants to organizations dealing with food insecurity. People can visit the Care Ottawa County website to donate funds or food items that are needed by Ottawa County residents the most.
   
 "It's been so helpful to see our community step up in this time of need," Uganski said.

He wrote in a letter to commissioners his recommendation to cut 16 summer hires, including six Parks and Recreation Division employees who would’ve run the city’s summer camps. The division also will have four fewer temporary workers, two fewer marina employees and one less seasonal cemetery position.
 “The city has traditionally had a pretty lean staff, so where we’re really making cuts, particularly in the summer, most quickly and right up front are some of the maintenance and operations during summertime,” he said.
 That means the grass the city mows might get a little longer this summer, Colburn said. Other maintenance could be scaled back, like weed-whacking, watering, planting flowers in some areas and painting railings.
 Other cuts include not hiring three seasonal bicycle patrol police officers and dropping projects like $100,000 in downtown cameras, according to the letter.
 The city’s general fund is expected to shrink by 1 percent, Colburn said.
 Draft budget figures put general fund revenues at $17,870,400 and expenditures slightly higher, at $18,084,600. That’ll put a dent in the fund’s $4,427,539 balance.
 Yet the city’s still able to tackle some big projects, in large part because the funding was already in place, Colburn said. Among them are ongoing sidewalk projects to fill gaps in the city’s walkway network, for which the city already borrowed money. There are also three bridge projects set to go ahead, which will be funded in large part by previously awarded state dollars.
 The Downtown Development Authority also is poised to forge ahead with buying more land for a new parking garage, DDA CEO Jean Derenzy said.

"The pandemic isn't providing a magic answer to our housing shortage problems and, therefore, it is not a magic wand that is going to cure housing affordability issues," Soper said in a recent interview.
 "The only thing that will provide more affordable housing in our big cities is additional supply — and there certainly aren't more homes being built in the pandemic — there are fewer. If anything it exacerbates the problem."
 The main players who are building that supply in Montreal have all told The Canadian Press that come Monday, when the province's construction sector fully reopens, every site they had operating before the shutdown will be up and running again.
 Condos have been selling during the pandemic, they say, with buyers 3D-viewing their units on computer screens rather than in showrooms and using applications to sign documents.
 Before the pandemic hit, one sign of Montreal's booming market was developers competing to build the city's tallest condo tower.
 In April 2019, development company Broccolini broke ground on its 58-story tower in downtown Montreal, called Victoria sur le Parc, which it said would be the tallest residential tower in the city. Chief operating officer Anthony Broccolini said no one during the pandemic has walked away from their down payment.
 His construction sites have been modified to comply with provincial rules on physical distancing and hygiene in order to protect workers, but apart from that, on Monday it will be "business as usual," he said in a recent interview.
 Devimco, the company that launched Griffintown's renewal, boasts the 61-story tower of its Maestria condo project, announced after Victoria sur le Parc, will be city's tallest residential tower when it's completed. Vice-president Marco Fontaine said he sold another 20 units of the project last month "without negotiation" on price.
 "It's not in our plan at all right now to drop prices," he said in a recent interview. While he expects some kind of pandemic-induced market slowdown, by the time Maestria is completed in a few years, he said, he expects the market will be back.
 Fontaine said he appreciates, however, that many of the residents in his buildings' smaller units are working from home and will continue to do so for a while. "They are in a space that wasn't made for that," he said.
 To adapt to changing urban behaviours, Devimco has begun discussions aimed at equipping condos with modular furniture that can turn into workspaces.
 While Wachsmuth says he doesn't share the optimism of Montreal's big builders, he is still betting on cities and the sense of liberation they provide. "There is a lot happening — but also, you can kind of be anonymous if you want to," he said.
 They "aren't universally appealing to all humans, but they are, I think, pretty durable to a lot of people," he said.

And then, the nightmare ended.
 A UIA official finally responded to a message Rogriguez sent weeks ago asking why her payments were still marked “pending.” Six weeks or so worth of funds showed up around the same time her COVID-19 economic impact check did.
 Rodriguez finally paid her piled-up bills, including months of pushed-back mortgage payments her lender told her she’ll have to pay in full later.
 ”When I thought about that, I was like, ‘Where am I going to get $3,500 at the end of this?’ That’s not very helpful if you’re not making any income,” she said. “Just knowing that I’ll be able to pay my mortgage is a huge relief.”
 Normally, it takes about 21 days from filing to direct deposit or check in the mailbox, according to Erica Quealy, spokesperson for the Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity.
 ”Given the volume of things we’re seeing now, it is taking a bit longer than that,” she said.
 Overwhelming numbers are to blame.
 On an average, less chaotic week, the state receives about 5,000 unemployment applications, Quealy said. The highest weekly tally during the COVID-19 pandemic was nearly 390,000.
 During the nation’s 2008 “Great Recession,” the office saw a significantly smaller peak of 77,000 claims in one week.
 ”People are going through some pretty challenging times right now and they’re looking for those payments,” Quealy said. “We’ve continually asked them for their patience as we try to get through them as quickly as possible — I know that’s little reassurance when they’re trying to make ends meet.”
 To date, Quealy said the state’s paid out more than $4.13 billion in claims in the last several weeks. Pending claims have been given priority, she added.
 But many, like Sean Seekins, are still waiting. His last day of work was March 24 and he filed for unemployment a week or so later. It’s proven an exercise in frustration.
 Seekins said he spent weeks trying to claim benefits, both online and through an automated phone system dubbed MARVIN. But the money hasn’t come, MARVIN’s disconnecting him and the agency’s help phone line is a “dead end.”
 He doesn’t understand what the website is telling him — next to each week for which he’s claimed benefits there’s a short message.
 ”It says, ‘Open non-monetary issue.’ What does that mean? For May 2 it says the exact same thing, ‘Open non-monetary issue,” he said. “There’s even a section in here that says, definitions, but it doesn’t tell you what that means.”
 Another part of the web portal tells Seekins he needs to file an additional claim, but he can’t figure out how, he said.
 Rep. Jack O’Malley, R-Lake Ann, has heard no shortage of similar complaints from constituents.
 ”When they call they get disconnected, or when they try to get online they get bumped out,” he said Friday. “Or they’ve been through the process but they haven’t gotten any check in 5 or 6 weeks.

Staff started extensive use of personal protective equipment, visits were cut off and those diagnosed were isolated.
 Then they began testing for the virus around the facilities.
 "In some cases, they found COVID-19 to contaminate equipment or parts of the facility ... equipment carts or blood pressure cups," he said. "The building itself is of high quality but the risk of contamination within buildings with COVID-19 is something we've been learning more about."
 The buildings were deep cleaned depending on the specific facility, equipment and how much traffic they saw, he said.
 Schwandt said he recommends "very proactive" testing within facilities and cautious tracing of known cases.
 "Even a small amount of contact, we have found, can lead to a transmission between residents and staff and so it's important to look very closely at even limited contact and monitor them for symptoms."
 And while the risk of illness from the new coronavirus does seem to be more serious among seniors, Schwandt said several of them have recovered.
 Dr. Roger Wong, a clinical professor of geriatric medicine at the University of British Columbia's faculty of medicine, said the pandemic has unmasked a number of serious issues faced by long-term care facilities.
 Not only do the care facilities need to address infection prevention and control but also underlying physical- and mental-health conditions, he said.
 "Those seniors who have more severe form of dementia, they are definitely at higher risk of COVID-19," Wong said.
 Alzheimer's patients tend to wander and might become infected in their travel through the facility, he said.
 While measures such as testing, tracing, extensive use of personal protective equipment and cleaning can help combat the spread of the virus, Wong said a "paradigm shift in the underlying culture and understanding and value of these homes" is required to help control future infections.
 He said these aren't just facilities for seniors, they are their homes.
 "That understanding will drive further change."

HOLLAND -- With sparse meat selections at grocery stores, a family-owned butcher in Holland has gained a lot of new customers.
   
 "This is the busiest we've probably ever been, with the exception of deer season," said Earl's Meats Retail Manager Laura Draisma.
   
 A slew of meat processing plants have been closing around the country due to employees contracting COVID-19, leading some industry leaders predicting a potential meat shortage.
   
 Locally, the JBS meatpacking plant in Plainwell closed down temporarily in April due to 60 of its employees contracting COVID-19, and one worker dying from the virus. Boar's Head Brand in Holland also had employees with confirmed coronavirus cases. An employee's family member emailed The Sentinel, saying 15 people had positive cases at the Holland plant.
   
 Earl's Meats uses locally sourced meats, Draisma said, and unlike grocery stores, they are able to cut whole animals and have a lot of frozen product, which gives them the ability to stay in stock more easily.
   
 "There are a few things we are going to run short on, and prices are rising quickly because demand is high supply is low," Draisma said. "But we still have plenty of meat on the shelf."
   
 Meat eaters might have to get more creative when they cook, Draisma said, and potentially use ground turkey instead of ground beef, and be willing to use a pork steak instead of a pork chop.
   
 "Pork and chicken seem quite strong, it's beef we've been having a difficulty finding product," she said. "Demand has increased exponentially."
   
 Earl's is offering curbside pickup to customers that need it, and asking for a minimum on orders. A limited number of customers are allowed to come into the business, located at 5685 143rd Ave. in Holland, and are asked to wear masks, along with employees.
   
 "Most people are doing a good job of reading our signage," Draisma said.
   
 Earl's Meats has recently seen an increase of about 50 percent of new customers, if not more, Draisma said.
   
 "We're all family run, except a couple employees that help us out, but other than that it's all family, we're extending and working as much as we can to meet the need," Draisma said.

DOVER - As the images of empty meat sections in supermarkets across the country circulate, local industry leaders are asking for the public's patience in only buying a week's quantity of items, in order to help stabilize the supply chain similar to measures taken to curb earlier runs on paper products, eggs and milk at the beginning of the pandemic.
   
 As of May 1, nearly 5,000 workers in meat processing plants across 19 states had been diagnosed with COVID-19, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, forcing several to shut down to decontaminate while temporarily losing workers who are forced to quarantine for at least 14 days.
   
 On Friday, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced 14 meat plants would reopen following an executive order by the president. The majority of the plants are located in the Midwest, but the list includes a Tyson Foods processing facility in Portland, Maine.
   
 John Dumais, president of the New Hampshire Grocers Association, said like other commodities, emergency measures to respond to the coronavirus have caused short-term "skips in the system."
   
 "Certain items will be missing for short periods of time," Dumais said. "For every product, there is plenty of original inventory - there's plenty of livestock. Like paper products, there was plenty available, we just couldn't get them out as quickly as possible."
   
 Karen Weston, owner of Janetos Market, said while her meat case gives the appearance of normal conditions, she has been forced to limit customer purchases of all meat products to five pounds per item, per individual visit.
   
 She said the limits are dictated by her suppliers of items, and she still has rationing measures in place at Janetos for customers purchasing paper items, like toilet paper and paper towels.
   
 "Many (meat) products are on allocation (purchases) from our suppliers," Weston said. "Looking at our meat case, we have a lot of product. Pork products may be the one item that becomes harder to get."
   
 Dumais said USDA and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) identify approximately 3,000 facilities across the country as meat processing plants, and the number of infected workers has been limited to a "handful" of locations. He said these plants account for roughly 80% of the meat industry's market. As a result, the temporary closures of even a limited number of facilities will have a ripple effect up and down the supply chain, he said.
   
 Dumais said the very nature of a meat processing plant's physical environment - the close proximity of workers standing in cold indoor temperatures - creates a hospitable environment for COVID-19 to spread.
   
 "Think of Henry Ford and his assembly line for the Model-T, everyone is standing next to each other to do their part of the operation," Dumais said. "That's what these meat cutters are doing, standing side by side. So, while these plants are shut down for 14 days, they'll check on their employees and put plastic shields up between them to make sure plants are as safe as possible."
   
 Dumais said he anticipates the meat supply to begin to recover in two to three weeks. Until then, he recommended shoppers at supermarkets look to substitute their protein shopping where possible.
   
 For example, shoppers' panic purchasing of ground beef for barbecues is driving up the prices for packages, and Dumais said they should explore the offerings of chicken, pork, seafood of frozen options for the week ahead. He said the prices of more premium cuts of steak like Porterhouse and tenderloin have not been increasing as rapidly as ground beef.
   
 "When large plants are temporarily closed, that means there is no transportation in or out for a long period of time," Dumais said. "So, when there are fewer workers there or some have to be out to quarantine, it'll be a slow restart for those plants. They'll have full truckloads going out, but it will require more than the usual number of truck loads going in, so there is going to be some backup."
   
 Dumais said he thought customers have done a good job moving away from panic buying. As such, he said customers should notice how supplies of toilet paper in stores have recovered after weeks of runs on the item at the onset of the pandemic. He said grocery stores are receiving steady supplies of between 6,000 and 8,000 products a week.
   
 "The human reaction is to buy extra quantity when the public hears media talk about how bad conditions are in the plants and they close, but that doesn't leave any items for the customer shopping after you," Dumais sad. "We're asking the public to do their part and wear a mask if possible, be cognizant of the fact stores are being cleaned on a regular basis and buy what they need for a week's time. Paper products, milk and eggs are back to the full amounts because people started to understand when they panic buy, it disrupts the system at the local level."
   
 Weston reiterated the need for customers to not over-purchase as they shop because when more meat processing facilities resume operations, the quantity and price will better stabilize at supermarkets.
   
 "The product will be here, just the variety may be limited," Weston said. "Pricing should drop when things are more normal, and we don't want customers filling up with high-priced meat when we think the prices will drop eventually."

PORTSMOUTH -- There may not be corsages and chocolates, and "out to eat" probably means a trip to the nursing home dining room. While Mother's Day in the time of the coronavirus pandemic won't look the same as it has since its inception, the staff at Seacoast long-term care facilities are working to make the May holiday meaningful for the moms in their care, and are responding with creativity and heart.
   
 Todd Fernald, assisted living administrator and human resources director at Webster at Rye, said they are scheduling window visits with families and residents all during Mother's Day weekend.
   
 He said they are using technology for social visits (Zoom, Facetime, Skype) as well.
   
 If their families can't be reached, no mom will be left behind, according to Fernald.
   
 "Internally, we are working on a special luncheon for our residents combined with corsages and gift boxes," said Fernald. "Mother's Day is also the annual kickoff to National Skilled Nursing Care Week so we will be celebrating all next week as well."
   
 Olivia Korpi, assistant vice-president of marketing and administration for Wentworth Senior Living, won't let a little thing like a universal pandemic come between her people and their families, especially on Mother's Day.
   
 She and the staff are setting up as many Skype visits as they can for this Sunday. It's especially important for her residents in the memory-care unit, for whom a visit behind glass could be stressful.
   
 "They can't understand why they can't touch or hug their loved ones," Korpi explained, adding, "This way they can still see them. The families will be able to sing their favorite song, or arrange for flowers."
   
 "It will be," Korpi said, "emotional and special."

 Korpi said the spirit at her facility is good, due in part to staff members who have "servant hearts."
   
 "We are really lucky," she said, adding, "One of our missions is 'a better life, longer.' But none of us had this in mind."
   
 Most of the residents "have been through worse," she said, including a woman who survived the London bombings as a child.
   
 "The residents are a team, the staff is a team and the families are our cheerleaders," Korpi said.
   
 Minna Bauer, director of recreation for the Exeter Center on Hampton Road, said she's mining the ideas from her volunteers and hoping to strike gold. She recently instituted an entertainment program outside residents' windows and is planning to find a singing group that can entertain while families are visiting. She also hopes to hang posters of appreciation in residents' windows.
   
 Everyone loves a parade, and Cornerstone in Hampton is banking on that for amusing its resident moms.
   
 Katrina June, administrator, said they are planning a Mother's Day Car Parade for Saturday at 2 p.m. The theme of the parade is "April Showers Bring May Flowers."
   
 "Families and friends are encouraged to decorate their vehicles based on this theme and if they are as inspired as last time, we know they will be decked out," said June.
   
 It's not the first car parade for Cornerstone, June added the staff and families put one together for Easter.
   
 "Our last Car Parade was an Easter Parade which drew over 100 cars. It was such a wonderful event which boosted the spirits of our residents, our families and our associates," said June.
   
 June said she and her staff are looking forward to Saturday.
   
 "We know it is coming at a time when everyone can really use another boost," she said.
   
 In the case of inclement weather, June said the parade will be moved to Sunday.
   
 June said residents at Cornerstone are in good spirits.
   
 "They're not afraid and it's very peaceful here," she said, with staff rising to the occasion they never expected to face.
   
 "We make sure they get out and get fresh air, and they're excited for the next phase," she said, referring to Gov. Chris Sununu's expanded guidelines.
   
 Cornerstone is inviting relatives to come over for "window visits" regularly, she said, and some family members are visiting as often as they did pre- COVID-19, she said. These are mostly local residents. Family members in Massachusetts and Connecticut obviously can't visit, she said, adding, "They are under their own restrictions."
   
 But Cornerstone arranges seven to 10 Zoom calls a day for people who can't make it in person, and "It's exciting for the residents, but it brings us joy as well."
   
 "These really are extraordinary times," Jennifer Montplaisir, activities director at the Rockingham Rehabilitation and Long-Term Care facility in Brentwood.
   
 But Montplaisir and the staff of the county facility will make the best of what they have to work with.
   
 "Mother's Day will be special," she said. "There are corsages coming in for all of our residents who are mothers and I will be going around and pinning them on the ladies to make them feel special. Our social service director has a number of 'window visits' lined up." Montplaisir noted that the window visits need to be scheduled through the office, so social distancing guidelines can be observed.
   
 And in the spirit of looking after "essential personnel," Montplaisir added, "We are also extremely happy that a group from Exeter High School will be doing meals for mothers that are working here on Mother's Day."

Researchers have found that improved everyday hygiene practices, such as hand-washing, reduces the risk of common infections by up to 50 per cent, thus reducing the need for antibiotics by up to 30 per cent.As witnessed during the recent global efforts to delay the spread of COVID-19, hygiene practices, including hand-washing, have become an essential part of everyone's daily routine and are considered to be the first line of defence in reducing the spread of common infections."In light of the current COVID-19 pandemic and evidence presented in this study, it is more urgent than ever for policymakers to recognise the role of community hygiene to minimise the spread of infections, which in turn will help in reducing the consumption of antibiotics and help the fight against antimicrobial resistance," said study researcher Jean-Yves Maillard from Cardiff University in the UK.The study, published in the American Journal of Infection Control, explored the role of targeted hygiene in the home and everyday life settings to reduce antibiotic prescribing and its likely impact on antibiotic resistance.It provides evidence that practising hand hygiene in homes and community settings can prevent infections and therefore reduce the need for antibiotics.One intervention study demonstrated a 30 per cent reduction of antibiotic prescriptions for common respiratory infections in a group who used hand sanitisers compared with a control group.The study also showed the increasing prevalence of multidrug-resistant bacteria in the home and community. It is considered that 35 per cent of common infections occurring in healthcare and the community are already resistant to antibiotics and that in some low-and middle-income countries, resistance to antibiotics is as high as 90 per cent."With evidence to show that home and community hygiene urgently needs to be taken more seriously, it is time for the global community to collaborate and recognise that reducing the need for antibiotics is important," the researchers noted.(This story has been published from a wire agency without modifications to the text)Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter

MONTREAL - Quebec schoolchildren will be entering a vastly changed environment this week when they head back to classrooms that have been closed since mid- March because of COVID-19.
 Students will be subject to physical distancing, frequent handwashing and carefully co-ordinated school days spent in large part at their desks while school officials keep up with cleaning, disinfection and following public health guidelines.
 The province is the first to reopen elementary schools in the country, and others are watching the rollout closely. One western Quebec principal said she's confident children will be able to adapt.
 "We're welcoming them back to a new normal, but we are welcoming them back as just our students," said Samantha Halpin, principal at Eardley Elementary in Gatineau, Que.
 "Our personalities haven't gone out the window. We're still going to be welcoming them with a big smile, making sure they feel safe, they feel comfortable."
 Some schools, including Halpin's, have prepared videos to prepare parents and kids for the reality — teachers donning goggles, masks and gloves; taped arrows on the floor to remind students of the two-metre distancing rule; playground equipment closed off with caution tape.
 Common areas like libraries, gyms and cafeterias will be closed, and pickup and dropoffs will be closely monitored.
 "It's taken a lot of thought and a lot of process in terms of trying to think of absolutely every single base that we need to cover to ensure we're welcoming our kids back with open arms while following the public health guidelines," Halpin said.
 Only elementary schools outside the greater Montreal region will begin reopening Monday. Montreal, hard-hit by COVID-19, will wait until at least May 25. High schools across the province remain closed.
 The Eastern Townships School Board plans to open schools Wednesday, taking a few extra days to iron out logistics involving transportation and protective equipment.
 About 80 per cent of students have requested buses, which due to distancing rules can't fit children from more than 12 households per bus, school board chairman Michael Murray said.

Created by hospitals, universities and everyday citizens in their living rooms, self-reporting platforms have emerged since the global coronavirus health pandemic hit.
   
 Many aim to fill in gaps of information that exist for COVID-19 data in the absence of widespread available testing, while others more simply want to monitor the symptom experience of a specific population, such as a particular college campus, for example.
   
 These platforms, experts say, are not to be substituted for official information sources like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, World Health Organization or state agencies, but rather can supplement them, and paint interesting data pictures likely not picked up by better-known collection streams.
   
 "This is a really interesting approach for this type of pandemic particularly because there is a severe lack of testing right now, so we really don't know who is impacted by this disease if they aren't getting medical attention, if they don't have access to testing," said Kara Sewalk, epidemiologist and project manager with Boston Children's Hospital. "We're using this type of participatory surveillance to help identify those lingering questions."
   
 Sewalk was part of a crowd-source platform launched by Boston Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School back in 2012, called "Flu Near You," used to support public health surveillance by capturing a population that may not be seeking medical care.
   
 The goal, Sewalk said, had always been to pivot the platform during another infectious disease outbreak, which is exactly what they did for the coronavirus. It's called "COVID Near You." The site has seen nearly 600,000 entries from people across the United States.
   
 "Continue to practice social distancing," the website states clearly. "This data represents submitted COVID-19 related symptom reports to this site, not confirmed cases in your area."
   
 Users can type in their zip code and view self-reported data in their community or region over the previous two weeks.
   
 "When you're looking at these types of tools, the big question to ask is how is that data going to be used, particularly with so many popping up," Sewalk said. "It's great you can collect this data, but what are you going to do with it?"
   
 Self-reporting platforms have been established both overseas and domestically since the onset of the coronavirus crisis.
   
 Several universities have developed their own platforms.The University of Cincinnati's College of Medicine, for example, launched a data capture system to help automate and streamline reporting and prevention of potential COVID-19 exposures for faculty, staff, students and visitors, for example.
   
 Pinterest CEO Ben Silbermann partnered with doctors and scientists to launch a new app called "How We Feel" that allows Americans to self-report, including their age, gender, zip code and any health symptoms they may be experiencing.
   
 An example of a citizen-run site, 19-year-old Samuel Henriquez, of Eliot, Maine, saw a "crisis of information" caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
   
 Home in Maine from Vermont's Bennington College for the rest of the spring semester, Henriquez consistently read about individuals experiencing COVID-19 symptoms who were unable to get tested because their symptoms weren't deemed test-worthy. Others lived too far from a testing site. For those reasons, they were being left out of data collection.
   
 "I kept seeing people who had all the symptoms, had shortness of breath and those who lived in hot spots, but they couldn't get a test and they weren't counted as statistics," Henriquez said.
   
 Using his data skills from his field of study at college, Henriquez designed ReportCovidUSA on his own, a self-reporting initiative to collect firsthand reports of coronavirus cases - both confirmed and suspected - from people around the country, "empowering communities and individuals to contribute to the information that will help us understand and move forward with confidence," he said.
   
 Three weeks into launching the website, Henriquez has more than 700 responses - all of which are anonymous - and he hopes to publish his first data set relatively soon.
   
 "In addition to this being a pandemic of a viral nature, one of the things making it so difficult in this country is a crisis of information," he said. "There are so many unknowns, it's difficult for individuals and organizations to act confidently and decisively."
   
 Henriquez writes on his site, "Impoverished, undocumented, rural, and otherwise marginalized communities do not receive the same levels of attention from governments, and as such are neglected in testing/analysis. Self-reported data allows for an equitable examination of the crisis across all situations."
   
 While Henriquez seeks to fill a gap in available coronavirus data, he makes clear his platform is not a replacement for official data collection streams - and no self-reporting site should be thought of as one.
   
 "This should never be understood as a replacement for formal scientific research and analysis, and I would be hesitant to label it as scientific," he said. "But in the case of creating a general ethos of information and providing the public and people at large with as much information as possible..."
   
 "There are definite criticisms to be made of self-reported data," Henriquez acknowledged. "Inherently, it's unreliable because of confounding factors. But I would respond to that by saying I'm very well aware of that, and although the form is vulnerable, the rigor comes in the analysis."
   
 Sewalk said there is "definitely a limitation" to her site, COVID Near You, "because it's all participant-reported data, people that aren't getting confirmed diagnoses."
   
 "In terms of how we use our platform, it's really to supplement surveillance, so comparing it to hospitalization rates at a geographic level, comparing it to confirmed testing," she said. "Not to be used as the only source of information."
   
 Henriquez's questions include whether or not an individual has been tested, circumstances around approval or denial for testing, and what symptoms they've experienced, among others.
   
 He plans to publish collected data in its raw form, and also assemble infographics speaking to larger trends.
   
 Asked if the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention has a stance on self-reporting platforms, CDC Communication Director Robert Long said, "Peer- reviewed scientific analysis and established epidemiological best practices will continue to guide Maine CDC's COVID-19 response. We encourage people to continue to seek information from reliable sources such as the Maine CDC website, the U.S. CDC website, and the WHO site."
   
 "I think the approach is really valid," Sewalk said of self-reporting platforms. "I think the only concern we would have from our initiative is how the data will be used and what the creators plan to do with it. The one big thing with these platforms is that for them to be successful, you need people reporting in, so how are you going to drive that engagement?"
   
 Jo Porter, director of the University of New Hampshire's Institute for Health Policy and Practice, and Amy Costello, director of health analytics and informatics at the institute, explained there are both value in and limitations to such websites.
   
 "I think we're both a little bit cautious about always vetting the source and being thoughtful about what kinds of error limitations exist," Porter said. "But you can look at a data source with a lot of limits and still get a lot of value."
   
 Costello said for self-reporting sites, the intent of the data collection needs to be understood, as well as what it will be used for. The collector must recognize "what is unique about the group that is likely to self report symptoms," she said.
   
 Costello said she recently listened to a webinar with a resounding message of, "At a time like this, we don't know what data is going to become valuable. Right now it's maybe any data, and then we'll figure out later what we're going to use."
   
 "The idea that something may or may not be good data right now, I think could short change us," she said. "But that has to be balanced with where are the legitimate sources of data and let's make sure those aren't compromised in any way."
   
 Both Porter and Costello pointed to the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services as the best source of up-to-date information for New Hampshire residents, for example.
   
 "The reality in times like this, the centralizing of that data is really important," Porter said.
   
 Porter said data collection can be harmful if it's not coupled with the science of medicine and epidemiology, for example. She encourages citizens interested in using their skills for this purpose to perhaps team up with experts, or an already-developed initiative.
   
 "If you don't have all of those pieces, the information you put out may not be as valuable as you want it to be," she said. "If you've got the opportunity to collect data, coupling it with the experts who can interpret it with the right level of understanding is key."
   
 Costello addressed the data that simply never enters the health care system, which surveys attempt to record. She also noted efforts coming online to crowd source information about symptoms through posts on Twitter, for example.
   
 "I think for a lot of these public platforms, you've got an ability to capture a whole host of information about people you're not going to get through these administrative platforms," Costello said. "But again, the importance is the cautious interpretation of what it means."
   
 Porter added, "Data has been fast and furious lately. You've got to figure out what the story is."
