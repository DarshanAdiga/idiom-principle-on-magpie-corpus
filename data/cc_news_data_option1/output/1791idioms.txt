GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) — The Trump administration has shelved a document created by the nation's top disease investigators with step-by-step advice to local authorities on how and when to reopen restaurants and other public places during the still-raging coronavirus outbreak.
 The 17-page report by a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention team, titled "Guidance for Implementing the Opening Up America Again Framework," was researched and written to help faith leaders, business owners, educators and state and local officials as they begin to reopen.
 It was supposed to be published last Friday, but agency scientists were told the guidance "would never see the light of day," according to a CDC official. The official was not authorized to talk to reporters and spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity.

Mumbai, May 7 (PTI) An employee of budget-carrier SpiceJet working at New Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport tested positive for coronavirus infection.                              The employee last handled SpiceJet cargo flight to Patna from New Delhi on May 3, a source said.                              Though the airline's commercial passenger services are shut along with flight services of other carriers due to the lockdown, its cargo operations are going on in full steam.                              This is the third case of an employee at the airline contracting coronavirus infection. The airline claims of "diligently following" the guidelines issued by the central government and the World Health Organisation.                              "One of our colleagues at SpiceJet has tested positive for COVID-19. He had last reported on duty on May 3 at the Delhi airport," a SpiceJet spokesperson said in a statement to PTI.                              As a precautionary measure, all staff who had been in direct contact with him have been asked to self-quarantine by staying at home for the next two weeks, the spokesperson said, adding that all measures are being taken to provide appropriate medical care to him.                              Late last month, one of the airline's engineers, who was also working at the IGI Airport in New Delhi was tested positive for COVID-19.                              Prior to that in late March, a pilot, working as a First Officer with SpiceJet and who had not operated any international flight in that month was tested coronavirus positive and asked to self-quarantine at home.                              "We have been diligently following the guidelines issued by the Government of India and WHO. All our aircraft and our workplaces are being disinfected thoroughly and the disinfectants used are as per the WHO standards," the SpiceJet spokesperson said in the statement on Thursday.           _(This is an unedited and auto-generated story from Syndicated News feed, LatestLY Staff may not have modified or edited the content body)_                                                                                                     *[FT]: Financial Times

Los reyes han estado acompañados por la vicepresidenta cuarta del Gobierno y ministra para la Transición Ecológica y el Reto Demográfico, Teresa Ribera, y por la presidenta del operador y transportista del sistema eléctrico, Beatriz Corredor.
 Durante su estancia en la sede de REE, situada en la localidad de Alcobendas (Madrid), han mantenido una reunión en la sala de emergencias del centro de control para conocer la evolución de la demanda eléctrica durante las semanas de crisis sanitaria.
 Posteriormente, han conocido el Centro de Control del Sistema Eléctrico (Cecoel), donde se hace el seguimiento de todos los parámetros de consumo en tiempo real y de las instalaciones de generación y transporte de la electricidad a escala nacional.
 Los reyes han llevado la mascarilla y los guantes en todo momento y han seguido las recomendaciones sobre distancia física con las personas que han charlado.
 En el encuentro con la dirección de la compañía, Felipe VI ha destacado "la labor de país" que REE representa para España y su "funcionamiento ejemplar" como empresa estratégica en un momento de crisis como el actual, pero también en el día a día para garantizar el abastecimiento a todos los hogares y empresas.
 "Damos por hecho que funciona, que el apagón es un fenómeno muy raro en nuestra vida diaria. El fallo del sistema es prácticamente nulo y esto hay que recordarlo. No solo por la garantía del suministro, la seguridad y la calidad del servicio, sino también por estar en vanguardia en todos los órdenes", ha elogiado el rey.
 Don Felipe ha enfatizado la seguridad del sistema ante las consecuencias que podría haber tenido un fallo que hubiese afectado a las instalaciones sanitarias durante estas semanas de emergencia.
 Respecto a los datos que les han expuesto sobre consumo eléctrico, en abril, la caída de la demanda fue del 17 por ciento respecto al mismo mes del año pasado.
 Tras la declaración del estado de alarma el 14 de marzo, el consumo se redujo en torno al 8 por ciento la primera semana y un 10 por ciento la siguiente respecto al mismo periodo del año anterior.
 En las dos semanas siguientes, cuando el confinamiento se endureció y solo se permitieron las actividades económicas esenciales, el descenso fue del 20 por ciento de media.
 Una vez superado la fase de "hibernación" económica, la demanda se recuperó ligeramente y se redujo en un 15 por ciento respecto a un año antes.
 También han desgranado a los reyes los datos de las energías renovables en la producción total del sistema en los dos últimos meses, que fue del 48 por ciento de media, superior a la registrada durante todo el año pasado (37,5 por ciento).
 A ello ha contribuido la solar (fotovoltaica y solar térmica), que alcanzó su máximo histórico el pasado día 3, con el 40,4 por ciento del total del sistema eléctrico.
 En el Cecoel, los reyes han saludado a los técnicos encargados de controlar el estado de la red y las instalaciones, también de las distintas energías renovables, y de intervenir si hay algún incidente en el suministro.
 En la visita, de la que no se había informado previamente, también han acompañado a los reyes el alcalde de Alcobendas, Rafael Sánchez Acera; la consejera de Presidencia de la Comunidad de Madrid, Eugenia Carballedo, y el consejero delegado de REE, Roberto García Merino.
 La de hoy ha sido la segunda salida de los reyes del Palacio de la Zarzuela con el estado de alarma, a las que Felipe VI ha añadido otras cuatro.
 La primera fue al hospital de Ifema de Madrid, otra al mando de operaciones de las Fuerzas Armadas, una reunión telemática desde el Ministerio del Interior con el grupo de coordinación de las Fuerzas y Cuerpos de Seguridad del Estado y otra visita al cuartel de la Guardia Real y al de las unidades de la Guardia Civil y la Policía adscritas al servicio de seguridad de la Casa del Rey.
 Como en las ocasiones anteriores, no ha habido presencia de medios de comunicación y la Casa Real ha facilitado imágenes y fotografías de la visita.
