The countrywide protest of workers of Geo and Jang Group entered the 65th day on Sunday. The protesters chanted slogans for the release of Editor-in-Chief of Geo and Jang Group Shakil-Ur-Rahman and condemned the curbs on the freedom of media.
 Addressing the protesters outside the offices of Jang and The News at Murree Road in Rawalpindi, the speakers called for release of Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman and vowed to continue their protest till his release.
 Secretary General Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists Nasir Zaid said Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman will be released through the struggle of the workers of Geo and Jang Group. He said the workers of the Geo and Jang group have challenged the rulers and will achieve the success of not only with the release of Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman but also ensure freedom of media.
 Chairman Joint Action Committee Nasir Chisti said the Geo and Jang group for the last 73 years has exposed all the conspiracies against the country. He said the media only shows the real faces of the rulers to the people of Pakistan and that was reason that they did not like the freedom of media. Media worker of Jang Group Amjad Ali Abbasi said whenever the rulers wanted to curb the free voice of the media, they always targeted the Jang Group but the workers foiled all the attempts against the Geo and Jang Group.
 He said Editor-in-Chief of Geo and Jang Group Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman will be released soon. Media worker of Jang Group Munir Shah said Jang-Geo Editor-in- Chief is the voice of the voiceless people. Magzine Incharge Rawalpindi Nadeem Khan said Editor-in-Chief of Geo and Jang Group Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman is being punished only for bringing the facts before the public.
 Press worker of the Jang group Aslam Butt said the government is protecting those who are involved in the flour and sugar crises in the country but arresting those who speak for the people of Pakistan.
 He warned if Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman is not released, the workers of Geo and Jang Group will launch a stronger protest after Eid. Leader of PML-N Youth Wing Obaid Abbasi said that all the political workers of the country stand firm with the workers of Geo and Jang Group for the release of Mir Shakil-ur- Rahman.
 In Lahore, the protesting journalists, workers, civil society activists and people from different walks of life vehemently demanded the release of Jang- Geo Editor-in-Chief Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman, adding the Supreme Court should take notice of this illegal arrest. The protesters included Jang Group Editor Shaheen Qureshi, Abdullah Malik, Zaheer Anjum, Akmal Bhatti, Mohammad Ali, Afzal Abbas and a large number of Jang-Geo Group’s workers. The protesting workers also maintained that their struggle for the independence of media and freedom of the press will continue till the release of Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman.
 In Karachi, continuing their protest against the arrest of the Jang/Geo Group Editor-in-Chief Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman, political leaders and trade union leaders said that rulers in Pakistan have been busy in suppressing the press freedom and arrest of head of the country’s largest media group in a 34-year old property case is a part of the government’s efforts to silence the media.
 They were speaking to the participants of the protest camp set up outside Jang Building, Azadi Street, in Karachi for the release of the group’s Editor-in- Chief Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman. The Jang-Geo Joint Action Committee organised the protest camp.
 The protesters carrying banners and placards inscribed with slogans in favour of their demands urged the government to release Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman and withdraw cases against him. The Jamiat-e-Ulema Islam-Fazl’s former member Sindh Assembly Hafiz Naeem Shamozai said that his party pays appreciation to Geo and Jang Group and particularly Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman for speaking and reporting the truth. “Because of the group’s bold journalism, the group and its editor-in-chief have been suffering difficulties of detentions and facing financial pressures but despite all it, they are not bowing to the pressure,” said Shamozai.
 Terming Prime Minister ‘U-Turn Khan’, he said that the current rulers have been cheating the people from day one and no one in the country is no longer trusting him now.
 He said that the JUI-F from the beginning has been protesting against the government because the party believes that the PTI is a selected government and has been given a stolen mandate.
 “In our rallies, millions of people attend but in voting boxes, our votes are in thousands. It shows that our votes have been stolen and a selected Prime Minister has been brought to run the country,” he said.
 Ikram Khan, secretary-general of United Workers Union,, Karachi Water and Sewerage Board, said that in Pakistan, there is a tradition to punish, jail, hang or kill the people who speak the truth and talk about the supremacy of the people, citing the example of Liaquat Ali Khan, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto and Benazir Bhutto.
 “And now Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman has been detained for more than two months in a baseless case only for the crime of speaking the truth.”
 He also paid tributes to Mir Khalil-ur-Raman, Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman’s father, for founding and expanding the media group on the basis of bold and quality journalism.
 He said that workers of KWSB are with the workers of Jang and Geo group and ready to attend any mass-level protest and agitation for the release of Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman anytime.
 The All Pakistan Newspapers Employees Confederation (Apnec)’s secretary- general Shakeel Yamin Kanga said that Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman’s arrest is the part of the government’s ongoing efforts to pressure the country’s mainstream media. He said that the current government has been punishing workers of the Jang and Geo Group and making their lives miserable by banning the government advertisements and paying the arrears of already published and aired advertisements.
 Kanga demanded the government to pay the arrears to Jang and Geo Group so that they could pay salaries to their workers before Eid to celebrate the religious festival with family happily.
 He also showed his concerns about the health condition of Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman and demanded the government to immediately release Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman whose detention in a 34 years old property case is apparently an attempt to gag and control the mainstream media.
 Chan Zaib and Yaqoob Kandahari of the United Workers Union, Karachi Water and Sewerage Board, Saeed Mohiduin Pasha, and Dara Zafar of The News Employees Union, Rana Yousaf of Javed Press Union also spoke to the protesters.
 In Bahawalpur, members of Bahawalpur Union of Journalists, press club and Daily Jang, Geo News and The News workers action committee continued their protest against the arrest of Jang-Geo Group Editor-in-Chief Mir Shakil-ur- Rahman.
 The protesters gathered outside the press club and condemned the illegal arrest of Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman. Addressing the protesting journalists, Ameen Abbasi said that 66 days had passed but the NAB had failed to provide substantial evidence to lodge an FIR against Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman. He demanded immediate release of Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman.
 In Peshawar, the Jang-Geo Group workers continued the protest against the arrest of their Editor-in-Chief, Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman, on the 67 consecutive day on Sunday. The protesters were carrying banners and placards inscribed with slogans, which called for the immediate release of the Jang, The News and Geo editor-in-chief and withdrawal of cases against him.
 The protesters criticised the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government and National Accountability Bureau (NAB) for being in collusion with each other. They said the government was using the national institution to victimise its political opponents and suppress the voice of the independent media. Speaking on the occasion, Daily Jang Resident Editor, Arshad Aziz Malik, senior journalists Shakeel Farman, Farmanullah Jan and others recalled that Mir Shakil had been detained for the last over two months. They pointed out that the Jang Group chief had been held in a 34 year old property case despite the fact that all legal formalities had been met in the transaction and there was nothing illegal about that.
 The speakers said the government was victimising the editor-in-chief of the biggest media group after he refused to follow its dictates. They said the previous governments, too, had tried to pressure the Jang Group but all those tactics had failed to yield results. Likening the arrest of Mir Shakil to an attack on the free press, the speakers said they would continue highlighting the truth as that was their basic duty.
 The protesters asked the chief justice of the Supreme Court of Pakistan to take notice of the “illegal” arrest of Mir Shakil who, they said, had behind bars for the last 67 days sans proof of any wrongdoing.

The LRH has been in headlines for some time, particularly since the outbreak of coronavirus when it was declared as main health facility to handle Covid-19 patients. However, most of the patients shifted to this hospital lost their lives allegedly due to poor services.
 According to officials, Dr Nausherwan Burki monitored the situation in LRH when emergency was declared after outbreak of Covid-19. He monitored the ICU and non-ICU patients and pointed out a lot of deficiencies.
 After thorough discussions Dr Burki reached to the conclusion that it was failure of the leadership. “He was not satisfied with the duty rota. He planned duty rota for ICU staff and organised other matters,” said the official. Now associate Dean, Dr Zafar, has been appointed as chairman medicine and allied specialities.
 “Dr Zafar is consultant rehabilitation and stroke. It was decided that he should take over as chairman medicine and allied specialities. He had delivered far better than Medical Director Dr Suleman Khan when he isolated himself for a week and Dr Zafar was given the charge,” said the official.
 He said all issues were settled except the ICU. “When Dr Burki made duty rota for ICU staff, Dr Ayesha and Dr Mazhar didn’t agree with him as they wanted to do it themselves. And that was the reason Dr Ayesha and Dr Mazhar resigned,” he said. According to sources, Dr Jabbar Ali has refused to step down.
 Dr Jabbar Ali is assistant professor in LRH cardiology department. He was junior to many other doctors in his department but was made its head. It is not clear whether he will be allowed to continue as head of cardiology department.
 The faculty members in LRH alleged that most of the doctors included in the panel to treat Covid-19 patients were neither trained for the job nor properly protected to treat patients suffering from coronavirus.
 According to the faculty members, one major reason of high mortality in LRH was the induction of doctors of irrelevant specialities in the panel to treat COVID-19 patients. It was alleged that COVID-19 patients were neglected and left at the mercy of Allah Almighty apparently due to fear associated with this disease and lack of personal protective equipment.
 According to officials of the LRH administration, senior doctors avoided treating coronavirus patients and this was the main reason patients died of complications. “How will the patients recover when they are treated by inexperienced junior doctors?” an official asked.
 However, the doctors have a different story to tell about the high mortality rate. They said that things went wrong when seniors were ignored while making a plan for COVID-19 pandemic. They pointed out that inducting doctors of irrelevant specialities was a blunder.
 Prof Dr Amjad Taqweem, a noted physician, suggested that since LRH had some of the best qualified people, including Prof Yaseen Khan, infectious disease specialist dealing with HIV, and medical specialists Prof Khalid Mahmood and Dr Salma Zeb, they should have been given the task to cope with the pandemic.
 “They are the only capable people in the present lot but I don’t think they will accept responsibility without authority. At least Prof Yaseen Khan won’t. He has worked for more than a decade. He won’t tolerate some people present in LRH to create issues for Dr Nausherwan Burki,” Prof Amjad Taqweem explained. He predicted that coronavirus would stay for at least 1-2 years.
 LRH spokesman Muhammad Asim said the previous rota of five consecutive days and then two weeks off has been replaced. He said now 12 hour shift duty will be followed by 36 hours off which will improve the performance and ease the stress on doctors. Asim said that management committee designed the rota recommended by Dr Ahsun from SKMH who visited LRH recently to evaluate the services provided in ICU.
 He added that assistant professor from anesthesia department of LRH MTI did not resign from her post officially. “No official resignation has been received from Dr Ayesha Mufti or any other consultant so far,” claimed Asim. He added that it was not a normal situation for LRH administration and its doctors.
 He said that facilities in corona complex of LRH MTI were exemplary where oxygen supply including ventilators and other facilities were available round the clock.

Liverpool star Mohamed Salah's agent denied claims made by an ex-coach that Real Madrid tried to sign the forward in 2018.
 Former Egypt international Hany Ramzy said on Saturday Salah had discussed an approach from Madrid with then national team boss Hector Cuper during a March 2018 training camp in Switzerland.
 Ramzy told Egyptian television channel OnTimes Sports that he was present and also party to the conversation, even though he only joined the coaching staff under Cuper's successor Javier Aguirre.
 But Salah's agent, Ramy Abbas Issa, rubbished the claims via Twitter on Sunday.
 "Mohamed never discussed any career plans with any ex-coach," he wrote.
 Salah enjoyed a stellar 2017-18 campaign, scoring 32 Premier League goals and supplying 10 assists.
 Jurgen Klopp's men went on to lose 3-1 to Madrid in the Champions League final in that season, with Salah substituted early after a tussle with Sergio Ramos.
 Salah has scored 91 goals in 144 games since arriving at Liverpool from Roma in 2017.
 He helped Liverpool sit 25 points clear atop the Premier League table when the season was suspended in March due to the coronavirus pandemic.

WHAT is a Men’s Shed without a shed?
 Though it might sound essential for a club with the word shed in its name to have one, Rosewood Men’s Shed members have proven they can make it work and keep the community alive without one.
 But now they don’t have to.
 President Paul MacMenigall told the _Gatton Star_ club members had finally secured a shed of their own.
 “It’s an old coffee shop on top of Evans Hill at the back of Rosewood,” Mr MacMenigall said.
 “It used to be a coffee shop but now it’s our shed.”
 The new facility is compromised of a shed as well as an old coffee shop the club is converting to serve as its headquarters.
 Six weeks ago, the club of 14 members moved into the shed and began fixing up the space.
 “We haven’t had any meetings since this whole coronavirus thing but we have guys working on the shed in twos,” Mr MacMenigall said.
 “We have permission to build a shed so we will have both the coffee shop and the shed.”
 The place will need a lot of work to bring it up to scratch.
 “We are not going to have a big opening or anything until we have built our shed,” Mr MacMenigall said.
 “It’s a bit of a mess at the moment because we have just moved in – when we first got there, it was shoulder-high in grass and we had to cut it all down.”
 Rosewood Men’s Shed members previously operated their club out of a park when they could.
 Before that, they held meetings at a pub.
 The lack of a dedicated shed meant members had to work out of members’ personal sheds.
 “We have had all these tools stored at people’s houses that belong to the group,” Mr MacMenigall said.
 “To run our activities like carpentry and metalwork, we need a shed to operate from.”

 While San Diego-area hospitals have not been overrun by COVID-19 patients, other regions have been. San Diego nurses have stepped up, taking temporary jobs in hard-hit areas through companies that link travel nurses with hospitals in need. San Diego’s Aya Healthcare has filled more than 5,200 crisis jobs since the outbreak began, while AMN Healthcare has placed more than 10,000 health care workers since mid-March.
 A team of San Diego-area doctors, nurses and respiratory experts will head south of the border Monday to advise Tijuana’s General Hospital on how best to treat COVID-19 patients with severe lung damage. One topic on the agenda is “proning,” the intricate act of turning sedated patients on ventilators from lying on their fronts to their backs.

“It expands your cultural boundaries, really, because I think it's as important to eat widely within the canon of vegetables as it is to read widely within the canon of literature,” Rhodes said.
 He believes that understanding the way that our food is produced can help us better understand both our bodies and ourselves. His advice to people who want to be more ecologically aware is to sign up for a CSA and to commit to eating seasonally. He recommended buying a regional cookbook like Six Seasons. “I think our body is kind of evolved to eat fresh fruit seasonally,” Rhodes said. “So I've found for myself that the healthiest diet is just eating what's fresh in season.”
 If you’re intrigued by the idea of adjusting the way you eat, or by the idea of joining a CSA, it can seem overwhelming if you don’t know where to look. Thankfully, Seattle-based community resource Pomelo is striving to make the transition to local eating more accessible. I spoke with Pomelo co-founders Kate Vachon and Christy Wybl to learn more about their mission.

All Champions League and Europa League fixtures were suspended until further notice while the English Premier League and Uefa have underlined their determination to complete the 2019-20 season, mostly behind closed doors. It is important to note that some countries have suspended their respective leagues, and awarded trophies and points. Cases in point are France, Netherlands and Belgium.
 Though this has been praised and castigated in equal measure, experts believe it was the best way forward in the face of the pandemic.
 The million dollar question is what happens in the case of Cup ties for example our locale FKF Betway Cup?
 My take is that defending champions Bandari Football Club be allowed to keep the trophy and enjoy the benefits that come with it. This will automatically mean they become the country's flagbearers in the Caf Confederations Cup.
 France's top-flight season was halted and after a meeting, Ligue de Football Professionnel (LFP) Chief Executive Officer Didier Quillot confirmed that the Parisiens were handed the title on the basis of points-per-game. I, therefore, don't see anything strange in cancelling the Betway Cup competition which was in its round of 16. Luckily for Bandari, they were still in contention. I foresee a scenario where the FKF may be unable to allocate time to complete the Cup ties. Giving Bandari the nod would be justified, owing to the fact that they did well in this season’s continental assignment.

 “All of my teachers who taught those younger groups would start with a ‘Question of the Day,’ so every kid would get a chance to respond,” Johnson said. “... There was always a chance for all students to talk, to answer questions, to have that personal connection that we missed when we were face- to-face.
