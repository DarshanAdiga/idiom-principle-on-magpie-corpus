I have had many Fall Festival memories throughout the years. Some from childhood, a few from hometown visits while away at college and plenty from my “adult” years as a member of the Fall Festival committee. This year takes the cake.
 For many, many months I knew this year would be different. COVID-19 changed everything. When it came time for planning this year’s festivities our whole group knew we were darned if we did and darned if we didn’t. Planning a one- day event was so different than any planning I had ever pitched in with before.
 I knew this time around would also be different as it would be my last one to plan. I had decided after many years to hang up my Fall Festival hat after 2020. As much as months ago it seemed like an easy decision, as time grew near I became a little emotional over it. I absolutely LOVE Fall Festival; every last bit of it. I eventually laugh at the yearly mishaps and I cherish the solid friendships I have made with my committee cohorts.

Coming into Friday night's action, 11 of the 16 spots in Major League Baseball's expanded postseason had already been claimed. The Miami Marlins, Cincinnati Reds and Houston Astros each locked up a spot on Friday, leaving just two slots up for grabs.
 The Marlins secured their first trip to the postseason since 2003, and the third in franchise history, by sewing up a second-place finish in the National League East. The Marlins earned that distinction by defeating the New York Yankees and having the Philadelphia Phillies lose to the Tampa Bay Rays. That combination gave the Marlins a two-game lead with two left to play. There are no tiebreaker games this year, meaning everything comes down to math. The Marlins won the season series against the Phillies (by a 7-3 margin), so the Phillies had to win the spot outright, something that is no longer mathematically possible.
 The New York Mets, who had their game against the Washington Nationals postponed on Friday because of rain, entered the day three games back. The Mets would've needed to win out and have the Marlins lose out to claim the spot as their own. (The Mets won the season series by a 6-4 margin.)
 As manager Don Mattingly noted after the Marlins' victory, their clincher came on the anniversary of Jose Fernandez's death in 2016. Fernandez, of course, was a brilliant young pitcher and a key part of Miami's culture prior to his death in a boating accident.
 The Marlins are projected to have the second-worst run differential (-39) by a playoff team since 1998, topping only the 2005 San Diego Padres. Still, the Marlins have a reasonable excuse, seeing as how they had to turn over a large chunk of their roster following an early-season COVID-19 outbreak. The Marlins owe much of their success to third baseman Brian Anderson, shortstop Miguel Rojas, and right-handed starters Sixto Sanchez and Pablo Lopez.

Carol Elaine Trimble Kieschnick   1946-2020   Carol Elaine Trimble Kieschnick knew who she was and what she wanted – to be a wife and mother. From her family's perspective, Elaine was the best on the face of the Earth at both. Born on May 4, 1946 in East St. Louis and raised in Taylorville, Illinois, Elaine (as she was known by her family and friends) meticulously created cut-out paper dolls of a husband, wife and children when she was a young girl with dreams of making a family of her own one day. Elaine later often said that, as hard as she tried to cut those paper dolls perfectly, she never imagined that she could build a family as special as her actual tight-knit bunch which consisted of her husband, Rev. John H. Kieschnick, and her children, Jonathan, Kimberly and Jason.   There was nobody (and never will be anybody) quite like Elaine. Married to John in Springfield, Illinois on July 4, 1970, Elaine pursued her ambition of constructing a family and raising kids in Irving, Texas where John pastored at his first church and in the Clear Lake area beginning in 1974 where the family moved when John accepted a call to pastor at Gloria Dei Lutheran Church. As a wife, Elaine was a stable, solid foundational rock on whom John could securely rely to hold down the fort as John excelled in his ministry. Elaine was a far cry from the stereotypical pastor's wife (as silent submission was not her thing). Elaine liked to shake things up a bit with her borderline-devilish sense of humor and her frequently vocalized opinions concerning virtually all topics except for politics or sports about which she did not care a lick. As a mother, Elaine was a trailblazer and a fierce protector. Elaine brilliantly employed unorthodox parenting methods (e.g., in quelling a fight between Jonathan and Kimberly, Elaine once required that the combatants sit down on the couch right next to one another, hold hands and exchange compliments until laughter at the creative "compliments" replaced the anger giving rise to the conflict). Elaine confounded speech therapists with a special language and novel pronunciations that Elaine used to communicate with Jason. Elaine had no reservations about utilizing corporal punishment. However, at the root of any of Elaine's disciplinary measures was love and devotion. Up to the moment of Elaine's death, Elaine gave anything and everything that she had to her family.   After leading her kids through their formative years, Elaine embarked on a long career in the Clear Creek Independent School District primarily as a Principal's administrative assistant. Elaine extended and commanded respect in that capacity. She exuded motherly love (and some old-fashioned discipline as necessary) to the students. Elaine also formed deep and long-lasting bonds with her co-workers who Elaine adored and to whom Elaine dispensed advice and opinions about love, life, morality and relationships often bewildering those within earshot as to how Elaine could get away with vocalizing such strong sentiments without causing a scene or jeopardizing the friendship.   Elaine's physical life on this Earth came to a close on September 21, 2020 surrounded by her family in her League City home. Elaine was preceded in death by her dear father, Roscoe Carroll Trimble, and her extraordinary mother, Lorraine Gilmartin Trimble. In addition to her husband and children, Elaine is survived by daughter-in-law, Olga Vladimirovna Kieschnick, of whom Elaine was so proud, by her sister and brother-in-law, Marilyn and Jim Rigney, who Elaine loved and admired, by her niece, Christine Rigney, who Elaine treated as Elaine's own baby when Christine was born and who Elaine always loved like a daughter, as well as scores of Kieschnick in-laws, out-laws, nieces and nephews who lovingly embraced Elaine from the day that John brought Elaine to Texas. In lieu of flowers or other gifts, it was Elaine's wish that contributions be made to the Endowment Funds at Gloria Dei Lutheran Church in Nassau Bay, Trinity Lutheran Church in downtown Houston or South Lake Church in League City. A private, family celebration of Elaine's life is scheduled.   As the end of Elaine's life neared, Elaine was inundated with cards, messages, Facebook posts and calls from incredibly compassionate people who were a huge part of why Elaine loved her life so much. One common theme expressed in those kind sentiments was that many people felt that Elaine was her/his "best friend" or that Elaine loved her/him the "most." This was among Elaine's great legacies – making people feel that they were the best or loved the most. In these divisive times, we should live as Elaine did in order to serve as a reminder that being loved abundantly and to the max is available to all – no matter race, gender, orientation, political party or nationality – by and through Jesus Christ with whom Elaine now peacefully and painlessly resides in Heaven.

El pasado 14 de marzo nos tocaba celebrar en la Europa de la cultura un nuevo aniversario del nacimiento en 1681 de uno de los mas grandes y prolificos maestros de la musica alemana del barroco tardio, Georg Philipp Telemann. No fue posible. Ese dia los latigazos de la Covid-19 empezaban a golpearnos como un huracan. Hace ya muchos años, en Hamburgo, oi por primera vez su Lateinisches Magnificat in C-Dur, esta portentosa obra de juventud del maestro, muy influenciada por la musica sacra alemana e italiana de la epoca. Fue compuesta probablemente en Leipzig cerca del 1700, por un Telemann casi autodidacta, y ya en estado de gracia.
 «Magnificat anima mea Dominum»... Que mi alma exalte al Señor. Asi comenzaba el primero y el mas famoso de los cuatro Cantica Majora con los que Telemann ilustro esta version musicalmente prodigiosa de un fragmento del Evangelio segun San Lucas. En el primer capitulo el Evangelista nos transmite en los versiculos que van del 46 al 55 el canto de accion de gracias que la Virgen Maria dirige a Dios por haberla elegido para ser la madre del Mesias, tanto tiempo esperado.
 Nos conmueve especialmente en el dia de hoy el mensaje de critica moral implicito en los versiculos evangelicos que van del 51 al 53. Los que nos recuerdan que en su llegada el Señor dispersara a los poderosos arrogantes, arrojara de sus tronos a los despotas, elevara a los humildes y colmara de manjares a los hambrientos.
 Su Magnificat Latino ya nos anuncia un mundo nuevo a traves de su introduccion instrumental (la Sinfonia) y triunfa en el «Et misericordia eius», para culminar en la polifonia coral del «Sicut locutus est». Telemann saco la musica de los cenaculos de los privilegiados a traves de las iglesias de Alemania y de su Collegium Musicum. Compuso para una infinidad de templos repartidos por el entonces Sacro Imperio Romano Germanico. Fue un genio al servicio de su pueblo, el aleman, al que inspiro con su arte y su talento a traves de una larga y fecunda vida.
 Creo conocer Alemania casi tan bien como mi pais, España. Siempre he considerado que el poder profundizar en su idioma y en su gran cultura siempre fue un privilegio muy especial. Admito que la musica de Telemann fue desde muy joven una parte muy importante de mi educacion. Tuve mucha suerte. La evoco de nuevo en estas modestas lineas, enmarcada por una rotunda admiracion por la obra de aquel gran hombre que nacio en la ciudad de Magdeburg, ciudad que como tantas otras de Europa fue martirizada no pocas veces a lo largo de su historia y que ahora ejemplarmente intenta eliminar la atroz arquitectura que le lego la ideologia totalitaria de la Republica Democratica Alemana, de tan tragica memoria.
 En el corazon de esa parte del mundo, tantas veces prodigiosa y tantas veces maltratada por sus propios hijos, a la que llamamos Europa. Que hoy, en el fragor de la batalla contra la pandemia que vino de Oriente, se debate dentro de demasiadas contradicciones. Las que hacen posible y manipulan los nuevos poderosos que padecemos. Los dirigentes luciferinos que ahora proliferan por medio planeta, tan ineptos como amorales y desalmados. Los que nos obligan a recordar que la gran Europa con la que seguimos soñando nos necesita ahora a todos los buenos europeos, mas que nunca.

 “I just think we have an obligation to fulfill our commitments to those people who made that decision,” Marshall says.
 Nor is it out of line with precedent. Kansas Attorney General Derek Schmidt notes that 29 Supreme Court vacancies have popped up in election years in U.S. history, and in every case, the president has nominated someone shortly thereafter. In addition, in almost all 19 cases involving presidents and Senate majorities of the same party, the nominees were confirmed. In the 10 instances in which the parties were different, the nominee sailed through only three times.

Calling attention to Black lives being entitled to be included among those lives that matter is merely an attempt to end our exclusion from the equation and the attendant senseless carnage. We seek only to bring attention to a ofttimes hostile environment where the valuation of our lives, and even our very right to exist, is ignored, disparaged, demeaned and sometimes destroyed, often at will, by people who feel that they and their lives are more equal than ours just by virtue of the lack of color in their skin.
 How is it anything other than unconscionable that a Black Man who has pursued the American Dream — receiving college and university degrees; served in the United States military; held senior level corporate positions of authority in several Fortune 500 companies; owned and successfully participated in several major international consulting firms; and served on boards of directors of colleges, large for and not for profit corporations and organizations, public radio and the Governor’s Council of Economic Advisors — and yet feels threatened by White men in Vermont who drive slowly by with a shout or a menacing glare from oversized motor vehicles or cars badly in need of repairs, waving large American and Confederate flags with long guns hoisted in their rear windows.
 These individuals, many of whom have never sought educational advancement beyond high school and or left the state for a job or for military service, are motivated by and spurred on by a national “leader” who foments discord and division as his political stock in trade. Their “hero” is an individual who has been credibly charged with disparaging, raping and taking other physical advantage of women; has viciously attacked the character of anyone who dared to disagree with his approach to almost anything; slandered or took revenge on a significant portion of the people he was elected to represent, including a decorated lieutenant colonel and a Gold Star Father; never served in the military; lied about his education and how he achieved his largely family generated and inherited wealth; is labeled by his own Sister (a retired U.S. Appeals Court Judge) as being a worthless, immoral bigot; been dully impeached; accused by many of appointing unqualified friends and financial contributors to positions of high government responsibility; and, has seen many of his closest advisers and supporters indicted and sent to jail.
 Of course “All Lives Matter,” whether white, blue, brown, beige, yellow or any other color, as well as all ethnic, religious and gender groups; but, the evidence seems to show that, in 21st century America, some lives matter much more than others. African Americans seek no special advantage or privilege, but, we do maintain that it is wholly, civically and morally responsible for those of us who believe there is inequity to point that reality out through various strategies and tactics, including, peaceful protests and ongoing demonstrations.

Without being economical with the truth, September 19, 2020 was a protest vote against desperation on the part of the political institutions in Nigeria. Very recently in our political history, Oshiomhole was bragging and saying things as if Edo State belonged to one man. In fact, it would have been a disaster, had Osagie Ize-Iyamu, whose debates were too much of personal attacks on the incumbent and whose SIMPLE Agenda appeared very unrealistic in today’s economic environment, triumphed in that election. Why did I say so? Apart from the fact that a victorious Ize-Iyamu would probably still turn against his godfather in the foreseeable future, the negative implications of a win for the All Progressives Congress (APC) would have surpassed expectations; for, among other things, the strongman would have become so powerful that he would have moved from the realm of ‘top party chieftain’ to that of ‘the Father of Edo politics.’ But, quite unsurprisingly, the former governor has forgotten that political science is not physical science. Since the former deals with human beings, you don’t take anything for granted. Above and beyond, that some people would influence an election to make the electorate vote in a ‘particular’ direction is not in doubt; it is to which direction that remains unknowable, and could not be predetermined.

Tom’s door was always open and had many kids that were his, not by blood, but by heart. But his heart was filled with love for his sweet girl, Angel and he never told her no.

 Can regular people be seed-savers and seed-keepers?
 Oh yeah, that is who does seed-keeping. It's kind of an anomaly that at this time, in this place, there are so few people keeping seeds. Around the world, it's still such a common practice. We've benefited a lot, since about 100 years ago, from the increase in small-scale seed companies. But in the 10,000-year history of humans growing food, domesticating food crops, that is the centerpiece of the work: making sure you're leaving some of your harvest to go to seed so that you have a crop the following year. So it's certainly something regular people do, and I'm hoping more and more people get back to that.

Whether a Public Comment portion will continue to be included on future Polk County Board agendas is unknown, as Chair Chris Nelson has voiced the possibility of discontinuing.
 Nelson opened the meeting with a warning about not using foul language during the meetings. There were situations in July and August that prompted the September statement from Nelson. “I have talked to I.T. If anyone gets out of line in Public Comment, you will be muted,” he said.
 When Public comment began, the first to speak was Soon Guenther of Alden Township. “I am here to speak as a Polk County Citizen and as a member of Amery United. Amery United is working to identify and address racism and violence in our community and educate ourselves and others around these issues,” said Guenther. She said another member of their group; Reverend Martinson had spoken at the August County Board meeting. Guenther said Martinson spoke of the, “Deep concerns many Polk County citizens have about the unending, violent and vulgar behavior brought to bare on our community by the man you appointed to represent us on a very important commission,” she said.

"I like the homers,” Cubs manager David Ross said. "That's getting back to what these guys do.”
 The Cubs entered the game with a .220 team batting average, fourth lowest in the majors, but unloaded against the fading White Sox.
 Contreras hit a three-run shot off Dylan Cease (5-4) in the third, then exited the batter’s box with sky-high high bat-flip. He greeted White Sox utility man Yolmer Sanchez, who pitched the ninth, with a solo shot for his eighth career multi-homer game.
 "We were on fire and I think we needed it today,” Contreras said. "It's good. We finally wake up.”
 The White Sox managed just three hits off Darvish and lost their season-high sixth straight. Like the Cubs, the South Siders have secured a playoff spot, but slipped into a tie for second place in the AL Central with Cleveland.
 Darvish (8-3), a contender for the NL Cy Young Award, struck out five and walked one as he cruised to his first win since beating the Cardinals on Sept. 4. In three starts prior to Friday, the right-hander from Japan slipped from his earlier groove and was 0-2 with a 4.26 ERA.
 "He really established the fastball today, which was a little different than his last couple of times out,” Ross said. "I thought he was really sharp today.”
 Baez drove a double into the right-center field gap against Sanchez while batting left-handed, his second time swinging from that side of the plate in his major league career.
 The longball once again hurt Cease, who gave up five hits — and three of the Cubs' five homers — in 4⅔ innings. The 24-year-old righty has allowed 27 homers in 26 career starts.
 The White Sox hope to rebound immediately in their final pivotal regular- season series.
 "We've had a good season,” Cease said. "The last week hasn’t been good, but other than that we don’t need to panic. We don’t need to lose confidence. We have a lot of good players, so it’s just about bringing it to the park.”

Jay Scanlan   1941-2020   James Edward "Jay" Scanlan, age 78, was born November 16, 1941 in Gooding, Idaho to Glenn Chester and Marcia Emilia (Laughlin) Scanlan. He passed away September 15, 2020 in Sun City West, Arizona.   Jay grew up in Gooding where he developed a love for sports and the outdoors. He attended college at the College of Idaho in Caldwell, Idaho, where he played basketball and golf, and also met and married his first wife Maisie Giles in 1964. After graduation, they relocated to Florence, Oregon and had 3 children. Jay started out teaching 5th grade and then moved on to teach Elementary Physical Education for 30 years. He coached basketball and golf at Siuslaw High School, first coaching the boys varsity basketball team (1964-1973) and then the girls varsity basketball program (1979-1987). Coach Scanlan developed the girl's program into one of the strongest in the state for AA Girls with his teams winning multiple league titles and making numerous trips to the state tournament. He coached both of his daughters and then retired from coaching high school in 1987 to watch his son, Jason, play his senior year of basketball. Jay continued to be involved in sports via coaching junior high basketball and doing sports commentating on the local radio station.   He retired from teaching in the Siuslaw School District in 1995. After 30 years of living on the Oregon Coast he moved back to Idaho and married Sandra "Sandy" Calhoun in 1996. Jay and Sandy lived in Boise until they tired of the winter weather and decided to move to Sun City West, Arizona full time in 2013. During his well deserved retirement, Jay enjoyed fishing, golfing, building a house, woodworking, spending time with and cooking for family and friends, traveling, and, most of all, being with his grandchildren. This tall, fun-loving, adventurous man will be remembered by his family for his amazing storytelling ability that was a key part of every camping trip or bedtime routine, his propensity to cheat at any card game, his role as the jokester of the family, his frequent burning of pancakes, his ability to turn anything into a teachable moment, and his belief that Gooding was the "center of the universe!"   Jay is survived by wife Sandy, sister Alice Schneringer; children Kenon (Kirk) Neal, Stacey Scanlan (Darren Johnson) and Jason (Wendy) Scanlan, grandchildren Tanner, Emily, Riley, Lily, and Maisy Scanlan, Joseph Neal, Jaycie (Josh) Merkley and Jennifer Neal, nieces Kim (Wayne) Greenlee, Teri (Ross) Davidson and Heidi (Doug) Duchateau, nephews Robert (Deann) Scanlan and Tony Schneringer, sisters-in-law Judy Calhoun and Teri Phillips, brother-in-law Todd (Gaile) Calhoun and their children, multiple cousins, and numerous friends that span all decades of his life. He was preceded in death by his parents Marcia and Glenn Scanlan, brother Robert Scanlan, brother-in-law Philip Schneringer, and grandson Jacob Neal.   Donations in Jay's name can be made to any organization that funds research for dementia. You could also play a game of cribbage, shoot some hoops, raise a glass in a toast, or just make some pancakes in his honor. He loved life. He will be missed.

In what is being seen as a major push for India’s energy security efforts, the Government of India is working on an ambitious plan to provide induction cook stoves to poor households in rural and urban India.
 By leveraging electricity to power India’s cooking needs, the government wants to solve three problems with one move: one, of weaning the country off LPG cylinders’ use; two, boosting India’s drastically falling electricity consumption, and; three, reducing its dependence on fossil fuels.
 It’s a nifty plan that looks good on paper. While its intention is no doubt noble, whether the move will likely succeed is another question.

It seems nothing had gone their way from the moment they stepped into the UAE. They were forced to be in quarantine longer than the other squads due to the positive tests. They have lost experienced players (Suresh Raina and Harbhajan Singh to personal reasons and Ambati Rayudu and Dwayne Bravo to injury) and they just haven’t looked match-ready as a result. These reasons might sound like excuses but right now, perhaps, even that would help CSK. It’ll just give the team a peg to stand on.
 Even as India captain, Dhoni would always talk about how the results don’t matter as much as the effort that was being put in by the players. If he was satisfied that the players had given it their all, then he would brush aside the loss as an aberration. That’s just how he was and still is.
 But in his comments after the match, he shone a harsh light on the aspects of CSK’s play that had been troubling him. He didn’t name anyone but those in the team should know better.
 M Vijay needs to do better – he takes too long getting set and then gets out. Shane Watson needs to give CSK more bang for their bucks. Du Plessis has scored runs but they haven’t really impacted the matches. No one really knows what Kedar Jadhav is doing in the team. Ruturaj Gaikwad seems like a deer caught in the headlights. Dhoni, in his own words, isn’t ready. Ravindra Jadeja is the first spinner to concede 40+ runs in three successive IPL games. Deepak Chahar hasn’t got the early breakthroughs. Piyush Chawla has seemed out of sorts too.
 To paraphrase Martin Johnson, there are only three things wrong with this CSK team: they can’t bat, can’t bowl, and can’t field.
 But here’s the good part for CSK. They have hit rock bottom and from here on, their fans will hope they can be better. Some harsh words will be spoken in the CSK dressing room, maybe even some changes will have to be made to the playing XI.
 But the break will give them time to reevaluate where they stand and as experienced pros, they should be able to come up with solutions. For the moment, though, they will be feeling like they are caught on a slippery slope – a few wrong steps could send them hurtling down and out of the tournament.
 As Mumbai Indians have shown in the past, a bad start can be overcome and for now, CSK will look to overcome their shortcomings in whatever way possible because what must be done, must be done.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Elizabeth Neumann wrestled with the decision for weeks. She worried about the backlash, the impact it would have on her career, potential threats to her family. But the former Department of Homeland Security official, who had resigned in April, reached a breaking point after President Donald Trump deployed Homeland Security agents to Portland, exacerbating tensions there. She decided it was worth the risk to speak out against Trump, whom she had come to view as a threat to the country. “Enough is enough,\" said Neumann, the former assistant secretary of counterterrorism and threat prevention. “People need to understand how dangerous a moment we are in.” There are plenty of others weighing the same decision. With just weeks left before the Nov. 3 election, now is the moment of truth for current and former Trump administration officials debating whether they, too, should step forward and join the chorus of Republican voices trying to persuade on- the-fence voters to help deny Trump a second term. “It’s now or never,\" said Miles Taylor, former chief of staff at DHS, who has been working to recruit others to join the effort. In interviews, Taylor has accused Trump of routinely asking aides to break the law, using his former agency for explicitly political purposes, and wanting to maim and shoot migrants trying to cross the southern border. “Those who witnessed the president’s unfitness for office up close have a moral obligation to share their assessment with the electorate,\" said Taylor, who launched the group REPAIR — The Republican Political Alliance for Integrity and Reform — to bring together concerned former officials. A related group, Republican Voters Against Trump, has compiled nearly 1,000 video testimonials from Republicans...

 Barcelona decided to overhaul its squad after the 8-2 loss to Bayern Munich in the Champions League last month. The 33-year-old Suarez was told by new coach Ronald Koeman he was no longer wanted. The club, hard hit financially by the coronavirus pandemic, also needed to reduce its expenditure on player salaries.
 Suarez bid farewell to Barcelona’s fans in an emotional news conference on Thursday. He leaves Camp Nou as the club’s third leading scorer with 198 goals. The Uruguayan helped Barcelona win 13 titles since arriving in 2014 from Liverpool, including four Spanish league trophies and the Champions League in 2015.
 Suarez forged a dynamic scoring duo with Messi over the years, and the two South Americans became neighbors and fast friends, along with their families.
 "I was accepting the idea (of your departure), but not until I entered the changing room did I realize what it means,” Messi wrote. "How difficult it is going to be not sharing each day with you, both on and off the field. We will miss you very much. These have been many years of many mates, lunches, dinners … many things I won’t forget from all those days together.”
 Barcelona transferred Suarez to Spanish league rival Atletico for up to €6 million ($7 million) in variables. He signed a two-year deal with the club after passing a medical exam on Friday.
 Messi tried to leave the club he has been a part of for 20 years after the debacle against Bayern, but Barcelona replied he must finish the final year of his contract.
 Suarez also took Messi’s side in the dispute on Thursday when he said, "I have to accept it if the club decides it is time that I go, just like the club should accept it if a player wants to leave.”
 He thanked Messi for his parting message in a reply on Instagram, saying "I love you very much my friend” and urged Messi not to let "2, 3 or 4 tarnish how gigantic you have been for the club and the world of football.”
 Messi has given up trying to leave this season. He has vowed to play his hardest for the team while he remains — even if he is even more disgruntled after Suarez’s departure.
 Messi’s comments are the latest run-in between him and the club board.
 Club president Josep Bartomeu has called for elections in March, when he cannot run again, but he is also facing a censure referendum that could oust him and his board in the coming weeks. The clashes with Messi will likely weaken his chances of finishing the season.

Speculation is building that Amy Coney Barrett will be President Trump's selection for the Supreme Court vacancy.
 Sources told The New York Times and The Hill __ that Trump plans to announce Saturday afternoon that the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals judge will be his third nominee to the high court, but they stressed caution because the president has a history of changing his mind. CNN first reported that Barrett's nomination was imminent and that she was Trump's favorite from the start.
 "She was the plan all along," the official told CNN. "She's the most distinguished and qualified by traditional measures. She has the strongest support among the legal conservatives who have dedicated their lives to the court. She will contribute most to the court's jurisprudence in the years and decades to come."

I lost my father before I turned two and I was left with my mother and siblings. Thankfully, my mother believed so much in education and was industrious. We had little, but she was determined to make things work. She had a grocery business, which we all had to work in to make ends meet. She instilled the discipline to hang in there when things are tough. There have been challenges getting to where I am today, but I’m glad I have a very thick skin to surmount them.

Once I start toward a season, it's hard to stop. I've been gathering speed down the slippery slope of seasonal goodies and have transitioned from transitional tabletops into a full-on fall festival quicker than you can say "it's only September." I am always surprised by some of the perceived "rules" that seem to pop up surrounding specific times of the year. A common misconception when gearing up for autumn is that you are limited to a certain color palette to be seasonally appropriate. Untrue! While I do enjoy more spiced hues and muddy tones to match the changes we see outside, there are many ways to bring a more seasonally appropriate approach to your home regardless of color palette. I've gathered a few different fabric groupings that range in tone from classic fall feels to a crisp autumn evening to show it's easy to pivot into a new season with a little textile fun.

Nelson threatened to end Public Comment if people chose to use certain language. He then asked the next speaker to be more professional and said the previous speaker will be put on a list and not allowed to make Public Comments ever again.
 Ken Nichols of St. Croix Falls spoke. He said he had concern over a resolution being brought forward without scientific evidence; which was required. “The fact that you are trying to move things forward without a scientific study stuns me,” he said. “I am an attorney and I would like to know what criteria the chairman has to shut people off? You have to be really, really careful. I get people swearing and doing things like that is inappropriate, but we need full and robust comment and the chairman just cutting off people, just because he chooses to, is not a good way to do business.”
 During his Chair report Nelson said, “First off, I always offer this-if anyone wants the job (of chair) I’m always open to change. At Executive committee we talked about public comment. I set the stage to say we are going to be professional. Clearly tonight I thought we had a little bit of unprofessionalism. I am going to set this out for the board, but if this is going to continue where people feel like they can just let it rip, and say what they want, we are not required to allow public comment.” He said they could switch to written comment and said, “That may be coming.”
 Nelson then said he had contacted Magnafici about his inappropriate language. Nelson said he does not look at Facebook and Magnafici’s social media was not part of the portfolio they reviewed when choosing him as a commissioner. He said Magnafici has apologized. “Not to make fun of it, but I know Tom’s wife has actually taken his Facebook privileges away and his cell phone for one week. So I believe that will stop and I hope he understands he is representing Polk County now,” said Nelson.
 Supervisor Amy Middleton said, “I’m a little concerned we are heading to a place of shutting off public comment. Obviously we cannot control what people say.”
 Nelson responded, “We have looked at our Rules of Order. Malia (Malone, Corporation Council) said our rules say we ‘may’ have public comment.” He suggested maybe it was more appropriate at committee level.
 “Last month we had a Pastor use the F-word several times, hiding under the umbrella that she could say it because she was repeating what someone else said.” Nelson said he felt she could have handled it a different way. “But she had to emphasize the F-word. That was fully unprofessional,” said Nelson. “Tonight we had someone say ‘Grow a pair.’ Men know what that means. Maybe women aren’t offended by that comment, but I thought that was very inappropriate tonight after I laid the ground rules.”
 Supervisor Russ Arcand said, “We are in a new era here. It used to be you either come to the meeting or you did not know what happened except for maybe through the press. Now it’s live. It’s new to us and the public.” He said there could have been children that heard those comments.
 Nelson said, “I don’t want to cut off Public Comment. I don’t want any assumption of that. Executive committee said ‘We have a problem, maybe it is time for written public comment.’ We will not read a letter with the F-word.”
 He then said that it would happen next month and that he was actually proposing it after what had happened earlier that evening, especially after he gave a warning. He then said they were done discussing it and told Supervisor Middleton her residents could call her with comment anytime. Even though he said previously that he was putting it out for the Board, he ended with, “It is the Chair’s position that there will be no more public comment. It will be read by the clerk- that is where we are going.”

The 2020 elections might turn out to be the most consequential of the 21st century so far — for Vermonters and for all Americans. At the national stage, in the midst of a global pandemic and economic downturn, a heated and unusual presidential election is drawing closer to its end. Whatever the outcome, there is likely to be outrage on one side or the other — an unfortunate consequence of continuing political polarization.
 Meanwhile, the balance of power in the Senate is contingent upon this election, with the majority swinging one way or another depending on which poll you look at. Who wins the Senate is likely to control a significant portion of the agenda in Washington for the next two years — notably, with court appointments.
 At the state level, the importance is no less significant. Whatever the outcome, next January we will have a new lieutenant governor and a new president pro tempore of the Senate. COVID-19 has changed the way we look at politics, also the way we are able to vote.
 Here are just a few facts that are unusual, to say the least: We’re on track for perhaps record-breaking turnout this year. The Vermont Republican Party has fielded more candidates in decades, including for all but two seats in the Vermont Senate. In the August primary, well-known politicos in Montpelier were tossed out, including Sen. Tim Ashe in his race for lieutenant governor and Burlington Rep. Jean O’Sullivan in her bid for re-election, among others. Gov. Scott will be tested for his COVID-19 response which, by all measures, Vermonters approve of in overwhelming margins. We’re likely to see the first female president pro tempore of the Senate. We’re also likely to elect the first transgender candidate in the history of the Vermont Legislature. Down- ballot and county races — like several contests for high baliff — have received an unusual amount of attention, as well.

The global death toll from COVID-19 could double to 2 million before a successful vaccine is widely used and could be even higher without concerted action to curb the pandemic, an official at the World Health Organization said on Friday.&quot;Unless we do it all, (2 million deaths) ... is not only imaginable, but sadly very likely,&quot; Mike Ryan, head of the U.N. agency's emergencies program, told a briefing on Friday.The number of deaths about nine months since the novel coronavirus was discovered in China is nearing 1 million.&quot;We are not out of the woods anywhere, we are not out of the woods in Africa,&quot; said Ryan.He said young people should not be blamed for a recent increase in infections despite growing concerns that they are driving its spread after restrictions and lockdowns were eased around the world.&quot;I really hope we don't get into finger wagging: it's all because of the youth,&quot; said Ryan. &quot;The last thing a young person needs is an old person pontificating and wagging the finger.&quot;Rather, indoor gatherings of people of all ages were driving the epidemic, he said.The WHO is continuing talks with China about its possible involvement in the COVAX financing scheme designed to guarantee fast and equitable access globally to COVID-19 vaccines, a week after the deadline for committing passed.&quot;We're in discussions with China about the role they may play as we go forward,&quot; said Bruce Aylward, WHO senior adviser and head of the ACT-Accelerator program to back vaccines, treatments and diagnostics against COVID-19.He confirmed that Taiwan has signed up to the scheme, even though it is not a WHO member, bringing the total to 159 participants. Some 34 are still deciding.Talks with China also include discussion of the world's second-largest economy potentially supplying vaccines to the scheme, he said.The U.N. agency published on Friday draft criteria for the assessment of emergency use of COVID-19 vaccines to help guide drugmakers as vaccine trials reach advanced stages, said WHO assistant director-general, Mariangela Simao.The document will be available for public comment until Oct. 8, she said.Earlier on Friday, a Chinese health official said the WHO had given its support for the country to start administering experimental coronavirus vaccines to people even while clinical trials were still underway.

OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Nick McCreary has been digging through gallons of trash almost every day for a month. It’s part of his job as Creighton University’s new director of sustainability. “You have to get your hands dirty,’’ he told the Omaha World-Herald. “That’s the only way to know how the program is going.’’ McCreary is in charge of a pilot program at Creighton to compost packaging and food waste from the takeout meals being served daily on campus. Because of the coronavirus pandemic, students have been eating outside most days instead of in the Brandeis Dining Hall. Takeout containers can’t be washed and used again, so it’s creating mountains of waste that in the past would have been sent to the landfill, where it would put more methane gas into the atmosphere. Methane is a greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change. “We had to figure out a way to reduce or divert that waste, and composting was the best solution,’’ McCreary said. Six 64-gallon totes are spread around the school’s mall to collect the waste left after each meal. Since Aug. 17, McCreary and a group of 77 student volunteers have collected about 260 pounds of waste each day. It’s picked up three times a week by Hillside Solutions, an eco-friendly waste hauler that helps businesses and organizations meet their sustainability goals through responsible disposal of waste materials. Hillside runs the only industrial composting facility in the area, on 27 acres near Ashland. It takes two to four months to turn pyramids of waste into compost that eventually goes back into gardens, landscapes and farms in nearby communities. Besides working with about 100 businesses, Hillside also has a Compost Club program for individual households. “The opportunity to compost with...

Jay Scanlan1941-2020James Edward "Jay" Scanlan, age 78, was born November 16, 1941 in Gooding, Idaho to Glenn Chester and Marcia Emilia (Laughlin) Scanlan. He passed away September 15, 2020 in Sun City West, Arizona. Jay grew up in Gooding where he developed a love for sports and the outdoors. He attended college at the College of Idaho in Caldwell, Idaho, where he played basketball and golf, and also met and married his first wife Maisie Giles in 1964. After graduation, they relocated to Florence, Oregon and had 3 children. Jay started out teaching 5th grade and then moved on to teach Elementary Physical Education for 30 years. He coached basketball and golf at Siuslaw High School, first coaching the boys varsity basketball team (1964-1973) and then the girls varsity basketball program (1979-1987). Coach Scanlan developed the girl's program into one of the strongest in the state for AA Girls with his teams winning multiple league titles and making numerous trips to the state tournament. He coached both of his daughters and then retired from coaching high school in 1987 to watch his son, Jason, play his senior year of basketball. Jay continued to be involved in sports via coaching junior high basketball and doing sports commentating on the local radio station. He retired from teaching in the Siuslaw School District in 1995. After 30 years of living on the Oregon Coast he moved back to Idaho and married Sandra "Sandy" Calhoun in 1996. Jay and Sandy lived in Boise until they tired of the winter weather and decided to move to Sun City West, Arizona full time in 2013. During his well deserved retirement, Jay enjoyed fishing, golfing, building a house, woodworking, spending time with and cooking for family and friends, traveling, and, most of all, being with his grandchildren. This tall, fun-loving, adventurous man will be remembered by his family for his amazing storytelling ability that was a key part of every camping trip or bedtime routine, his propensity to cheat at any card game, his role as the jokester of the family, his frequent burning of pancakes, his ability to turn anything into a teachable moment, and his belief that Gooding was the "center of the universe!"Jay is survived by wife Sandy, sister Alice Schneringer; children Kenon (Kirk) Neal, Stacey Scanlan (Darren Johnson) and Jason (Wendy) Scanlan, grandchildren Tanner, Emily, Riley, Lily, and Maisy Scanlan, Joseph Neal, Jaycie (Josh) Merkley and Jennifer Neal, nieces Kim (Wayne) Greenlee, Teri (Ross) Davidson and Heidi (Doug) Duchateau, nephews Robert (Deann) Scanlan and Tony Schneringer, sisters-in-law Judy Calhoun and Teri Phillips, brother-in-law Todd (Gaile) Calhoun and their children, multiple cousins, and numerous friends that span all decades of his life. He was preceded in death by his parents Marcia and Glenn Scanlan, brother Robert Scanlan, brother-in- law Philip Schneringer, and grandson Jacob Neal. Donations in Jay's name can be made to any organization that funds research for dementia. You could also play a game of cribbage, shoot some hoops, raise a glass in a toast, or just make some pancakes in his honor. He loved life. He will be missed.

Lancaster County 4-H has named Tracy Pracheil of Lincoln as winner of the September “Heart of 4-H Award” in recognition of outstanding volunteer service.
 Tracy has volunteered with Lancaster County 4-H for eight years. She started as a parent volunteer with the Clover Kids 4-H club and now leads the Little Green Giants club. She has also helped staff shifts at the 4-H food stand at the Lancaster County Super Fair.
 Previously, Tracy volunteered with 4-H in Seward County and as a member of the Collegiate 4-H club at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.
 “I enjoy helping young people prepare for their future,” Pracheil says. “4-H provides opportunities for youth to gain new skills and meet new people. The members in the Little Green Giants all attend different schools across Lincoln — so the club’s projects and activities provide them a way to learn new things with new friends. I love seeing club members give informal presentations about something they really enjoy during club meetings. It’s a great way to learn more about them and to see who else in the club shares their interests.”
