The ICC Chief Executives Committee on Thursday unanimously agreed to revamp the Future Tour Programs (FTP) till 2023, conceding that the "scale and complexity" of getting cricket started again "cannot be underestimated" in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 The CEC meeting, held via tele-conference, decided that a decision on the World Test Championship (WTC) and the proposed ODI league, scheduled in June, can be taken at a later date. However, it is a given that the WTC final is unlikely to be held in June, 2021 as per the current FTP cycle and a four- month lag is expected.
 But the T20 World Cup is on course even though Cricket Australia CEO Kevin Roberts said that his board is ready for any eventuality.
 "There was agreement that the disrupted FTP programme would need to be collectively reviewed through to 2023 with a view to rescheduling as much of the cricket that has been postponed due to COVID-19 as possible," the ICC said in a statement.
 Already, England's tour of Sri Lanka stands postponed along with Australia's tour of New Zealand.
 Pakistan and the West Indies' tours during the English summer also look to be in serious doubt. In fact, the West Indies' tour is all but postponed.
 It was also learnt that contingency plans are being made for the T20 World Cup in Australia, scheduled for October and November.
 "The CEC was updated on the continuing contingency planning for all ICC global events, including the ICC men's T20 World Cup 2020 and the ICC women's Cricket World Cup 2021.
 "Planning for both events as currently scheduled is ongoing."
 When asked about the contingency plans, a CEC member told PTI, "The complete FTP has gone for a toss. So, the remaining part of next three years will be revamped.
 "Although all these Test series are part of the WTC, but bilateral series is an agreement between two countries. So, all the rescheduled series will take time.
 "So, while all the league phase of WTC was set to be completed by March 2021, it is simply not possible now as there will be a few more Test series that will be disrupted.
 the CEC member said that New Zealand might not travel to Bangladesh.
 "So expect at least a four-month lag in WTC cycle," he said.
 ICC's official line is that "discussions and decisions on this and the future of both the World Test Championship and the ICC men's cricket World Cup Super League will be held at a later date when there is a greater understanding of the impact of the cricket that has been lost on the competitions."
 Chair of the ICC Medical Committee, Dr Peter Harcourt provided a general medical update to the meeting and the challenge that the governing body is facing.
 "The situation is rapidly evolving and full of significant risk as there is still a lot to learn about COVID-19 which can make decision making difficult.
 "The ICC Medical Committee is working with Member medical representatives to build a comprehensive picture of the issues cricket is facing," he said.
 Harcourt made it clear that the roadmap for resumption will be different for different countries depending on the medical situation.
 "This will consider everything from player preparation to government restrictions and advisories and bio-bubbles."
 He admitted that it is indeed a complex situation caused by the pandemic which has resulted in lakhs of deaths.
 "The scale and complexity of getting cricket started again cannot be underestimated particularly with respect to a global event.
 "The more teams, venues and cities involved in an event, the greater the risk which has to be assessed and managed."
 ICC Chief Executive Manu Sawhney said said there were several complexities involved in being able to stage ICC global events.
 "...they will be carefully considered before any decisions are arrived at in the best interests of the game," he said.
 Cricket Australia Chief Executive Roberts on his part said that all "options are being explored" at the moment.
 "...will take the right decisions at the right time so we can host a wonderful celebration of the sport and keep everyone involved safe and well," Roberts added in an ICC statement.

BERLIN (AP) — Organizers of a year-long international Arctic science expedition say they have found a way to keep going despite difficulties caused by the pandemic lockdown, but it will require a three-week break in the mission. Germany’s Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Ocean Research said Friday that the expedition ship RV Polarstern will leave its position in the high Arctic, breaking through the surrounding sea ice to rendezvous with two German vessels bringing fresh supplies and crew. The maneuver is necessary because travel restrictions imposed to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus make a planned resupply by plane and ship from Norway impossible. Expedition leader Markus Rex told The Associated Press that the lockdown could have scuttled the remainder of the mission. “For a long time it was on a knife edge and there was even a possibility that the expedition might have to be broken off,” he said. The 140-million-euro ($158 million) expedition set out last September with 100 scientists and crew from 17 nations on board. Its goal is to study the impact of global warming on the Arctic and improve scientific models used to forecast how the climate will change worldwide. Rex said expedition members will have to pause numerous scientific measurements during the three-week supply run, but that this was preferable to abandoning the mission entirely. “In view of the massive challenge caused by the global pandemic we're very glad that we can do this,\" he said, adding that the expedition should be able to continue until October as planned. Seven team members were flown out Wednesday using two Twin Otter aircraft from Canada, but the planes were too small to allow for the larger crew rotation and resupply required, Rex added.

Black residents are infected by the coronavirus at a higher rate than other races, racial data from the county and state shows, although they are the minority population.
 St. Mary’s health department recently added a new page to its website that tracks age, ZIP code, gender and race of COVID-19 patients.
 Dr. Meena Brewster, the county’s health officer, said identifying differences in data makes them question why the differences exist “and may point to needed community action to address those factors. This helps us achieve health equity for our whole community.”
 The race and ethnicity data shows of the 130 confirmed virus cases as of Thursday morning in the county, 44 were African American residents and 47 were white residents, while 39 people were in the other or not identified category.
 “The data we have seems to suggest that African American residents in our county are being diagnosed with COVID-19 more than expected out of all of those who are diagnosed. However, the data is incomplete. There are a large number of people diagnosed who have not identified their race/ethnicity and there are likely others in St. Mary’s who have not been tested but have the illness,” Brewster said.
 She added that national statistics show African Americans are being diagnosed at higher rates and the disparities are being investigated.
 Maryland’s coronavirus site also tracks race and ethnicity data for patients in the state. Thursday morning’s statewide numbers showed of the 15,737 confirmed cases, black residents accounted for 5,800 of confirmed cases, 289 deaths and 21 probable deaths, meaning the person’s death certificate lists COVID-19 as the cause of death but it is not yet confirmed by a laboratory test.
 The next highest numbers by race are white residents with 3,662 confirmed cases, 258 deaths and 39 probable deaths. Followed by the hispanic community with 2,130 confirmed cases and 72 deaths. Racial data for over 3,200 other cases and three dozen deaths is not available.
 Although black Marylanders have the most cases, the U.S. Census Bureau reports they make up close to a third of the state’s population. St. Mary’s population includes 78.3% of white residents and 14.7% of black residents.
 “I think COVID is just highlighting issues the black community has been facing for a while. I guess this may be an opportunity for people to see some of the issues we have with the health care system, access and whatnot,” William “BJ” Hall, president of St. Mary’s NAACP, said.
 Hall said someone described the racial data perfectly by saying, “I’m shocked, but I’m not surprised.” He said the numbers already highlight the problem and if someone cannot see that, he won’t bother arguing with that person. He said he becomes frustrated with those who don’t see this as systematic racism and there are people in this community who do not want to acknowledge it.
 Robert Martinez of Ridge submitted a letter to The Enterprise titled “When all fails, blame racism” this week in response to a column that highlighted coronavirus racial data in the state and country.
 “People must take responsibility for themselves, not society taking their responsibility. The deaths, incarcerations, poor health facilities — are all tragic and devastating to Americans of all color. Once again, when rational thought/analysis fails — use skewed unrelated statistics and blanket edicts — blame racism,” he wrote.
 Martinez did not respond to request for comment by press time.
 Vernon Gray of California told The Enterprise high numbers for black residents doesn’t make the virus racist, and the higher case numbers in women doesn’t make the virus sexist.
 “It’s somewhat premature in the available data to draw too many correlations to race, ethnicities or even sexes,” he said.
 St. Mary’s health department data shows the number of cases fairly evenly split between males and females; state data does show more females than males, in terms of number of cases, although more males are listed as dying from COVID-19.
 Gray noted that those who are less privileged will have less access to health care and become more vulnerable to the virus. He also said that underlying health conditions are also a major factor, especially when it comes to age. Gray added that diabetes being more prevalent in “particular ethnic groups” would be an explanation for a racial disparity.
 Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-Md., 5th) wrote a letter to Gov. Larry Hogan (R) on Tuesday acknowledging the racial disparity in the state and that black residents consists of 37% of the cases that day.
 “Black Americans are at a higher risk of exposure to this virus through frontline jobs without telework options. Additionally, people of color are more likely to be uninsured and have a higher risk of asthma, heart disease, diabetes and hypertension. Decades of implicit racial bias in our health care system, from diagnosis to treatment, have put many black Americans at a default disadvantage as the nation confronts this pandemic,” he wrote.
 Hoyer suggested a few actions the state should take, like setting up testing locations in Prince George’s County (the district with the most cases), providing more public health education and develop plans to address long-term racial health disparities.
 Tom Oakley of Drayden said having racial data is “extremely important” and “no one group should be suffering.”
 He said he sees and hears comments on social media and news outlets that show some people try to avoid the racial data or blame the victims. Oakley said he checks St. Mary’s health department site every day for stats and the racial data is not in proportion with the population numbers.
 He and Brewster both said they hope the department will never have to report racial disparities in the number of COVID-19 deaths — Brewster said that race breakdowns are only provided when the numbers are high enough to protect patience confidentiality.

India limited overs vice-captain Rohit Sharma wants his team to win at least two out of the next three World Cups and says the management is making a conscious effort to give young players adequate chances to prove themselves.
 Rohit spoke his mind in an Instagram live session with former India spinner Harbhajan Singh.
 "My personal aim is that we as a team should be able to win at least two World Cups out of three coming up," he said referring to the T20 World Cup in 2020 and 2021 and 50-over World Cup in 2023.
 India have not won a global event since the 2013 Champions Trophy. Rohit had hit a record five hundreds in the 2019 World Cup but India could not go beyond the semifinals.
 "Probably, if we did not lose wickets in the that opening half hour (against New Zealand), we could have won the game. Those 10 overs were really important," said Rohit, recalling India's batting collapse in the all- important semifinals.
 In the recent past, India have tried many players in the middle-order but that department still looks unsettled, though Shreyas Iyer has emerged as a solid number four.
 "We keep talking about backing players in the team so that they can cement their places. There is a lot of pressure on captain and coach to pick the players and back them.
 "It is important to give them enough chances. We have heard about how dada (Sourav Ganguly) backed you (Harbhajan) and Yuvi (Yuvraj Singh). How they backed you and then you delivered. Same way we should do it, the process is on. Whoever is being backed at the moment will get adequate chances."
 Rohit recollected the time when he got into the Indian team.
 "When you don't get a consistent run, the player's confidence is hit. It happened with me also. It depends on the individual how he utilises that opportunity.
 "We should back the players till the time you are absolutely sure that he is not in the scheme of things in the long run."
