So, what’s with the increase? The Federal Reserve’s asset purchases of government securities aim to keep the pump primed amid the Covid-19 crisis. The flip side to all of this is the inflation; and investors are keeping their eye on the money supply to gauge its long-awaited return. Although there’s much more that goes into inflationary factors besides money supply, the ballooning green is something worth watching. After all, over 20% of all the dollars in existence was created in 2020. A large “disturbance in the (monetary) force” such as this can’t go without some kind of residual effect, or can it? As this week's muted inflation showed, it's not being manifested just yet.

If you're in the market for a gaming laptop to get you through a particularly rough winter, you might be in luck. Amazon is selling a well- equipped version of the Razer Blade 15 Base laptop for $1,350, or a steep $450 off the usual price. That money nets you a six-core, 10th-generation Core i7 chip, GeForce RTX 2060 graphics, a 1080p 144Hz display, 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. It's $50 lower than the previous all-time low on Amazon, so you might want to act swiftly if you've been waiting for a sale.Buy Razer Blade 15 Base on Amazon - $1,350 You won't get the proverbial bells and whistles of the Blade 15 Advanced or pro-oriented Studio Edition, but this is still a solid spec for the money that can handle many modern games with grace, including some ray-traced titles thanks to the RTX 2060 video. It's even somewhat expandable with an open M.2 slot for another SSD if you run out of storage. You will, of course, get Razer mainstays like Chroma RGB lighting and Thunderbolt 3 connectivity for peripherals like external GPUs.Just remember that Razer's PC isn't the only gaming portable in town. We've been fans of ASUS' ROG Zephyrus G series, for example. They don't have built-in webcams (important in an era of remote school and work), but they boast speedy AMD Ryzen 4000-series chips and sometimes offer better specs for the money -- the G15 can be had with a 240Hz display and a 1TB SSD for about $1,399 as we write this. The Blade 15 Base is a solid balance, though, and may be particularly appealing if you're a fan of Razer's ecosystem.Follow @EngadgetDeals on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.

Google is once again delaying its return to the office in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, although it's now planning a change to the way people work when they get back. The New York Times has obtained company-wide email from Sundar Pichai indicating that the company will not only push back reopenings to September 2021, but pilot a "flexible workweek" when in-person work resumes. Staff would be expected to work in the office for at least three days of "collaboration," but could spend any other days at home.The company wants to test a theory that more flexible work would lead to better "productivity, collaboration, and well-being," Pichai said. He boasted that no other company at its size had tried a "fully hybrid" model like this before. The exact timing for flexible schedules isn't certain due to the varying state of the novel coronavirus across countries, and it might not apply to those who have to directly interact with customers and workers. Google has already been looking at more flexible offices that reduce risks and enable remote work, such as in-office presentation booths for online sessions and outdoor spaces for larger company gatherings.Google has repeatedly pushed back its office return strategy. It was optimistic about a return to work as early as July 2020, but delayed that to September, then January 2021, and more recently July 2021. The new timeline is an acknowledgment that the recovery might take a long time, and that it might not be safe until most or all employees have taken a vaccine.The remote work plan isn't the most ambitious. Companies like Twitter are allowing employees to work from home indefinitely, while Shopify and others have indicated that most staff will work remotely by default. Google is clearly larger than either, however, and what it does might set an example for other companies as they consider how office work might resume.

Pasban Democratic Party Chairman Altaf Shakoor said in his petition that the period prescribed in the first proviso of Article 27(1) of the country’s constitution for reserving posts for persons belonging to a class or area to secure their adequate representation in service of Pakistan had expired long ago but it was still being applied to such applicants.
 The petitioner said that such a restriction was discriminatory and contrary to the fundamental rights guaranteed by the constitution to the citizens of the country for joining service of Pakistan.
 He said the quota system was practically dead and buried after expiring in 2013 because the constitutional cover is no more available to it, so in the absence of extending the period, implementing the quota regime had already become unlawful.
 He also said the quota system was still illegally and unlawfully applicable to specific areas, including the determining of the share of various areas in making appointments in the bureaucracy through the competitive examinations. He claimed that successive governments had tried their best to continue the expired quota system on various pretexts.
 Shakoor said that in 1999 the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz government had extended the quota system, adding that in 2017 it had revised the system and agreed that the quota issue should be taken to the Council of Common Interests so that all four provinces could get equal representation while a debate should also be held on it in parliament.
 He said the federal and provincial governments had killed merit by continuing to enforce an unjust system and had hurt merit-based induction in the CSS (Central Superior Services).
 He pointed out that only 7.5 per cent of the seats were reserved for open merit while the remaining 92.5 per cent were reserved for quota-based applicants, regardless of their eligibility.
 He said that according to the quota system, the ratio of the provinces in government jobs was as follows: Punjab 50 per cent, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa 11.5 per cent, Sindh 11.4 per cent, Balochistan six per cent, the Federally Administered Tribal Areas and Gilgit-Baltistan four per cent, and Azad Jammu & Kashmir two per cent.
 He also said the quota system distribution showed that one could not apply in any other province, which was mala fide (in bad faith) and unconstitutional, and exposed mens rea (criminal intent) as regards the educated young generation of urban Sindh, especially Karachi, because the policy deprived the city’s youth of bureaucratic seats as well as of service in the federation and in the province.
 The petitioner said that advertisements for jobs in the Karachi Port Trust, which is situated in Karachi, clearly invited applications from the entire Pakistan, excluding Karachi, which was a unique example of inequality and deprivation because first priority was always supposed to be given to the locals first and priority should be given to the locals. The situation is the same when it comes to the Pakistan Navy, he added.
 He said the quota system was the root cause of racism in the country, resulting in widespread economic disparity and hatred among the people. The outcome is that 90 per cent of the country’s bureaucrats are recruited through lowering the selection criteria, thus depriving intelligent and eligible Pakistanis from serving the nation, resulting in inefficiency, corruption and racism as well as destruction of the country, he added.
 He also said the quota system had resulted in the collapse of the country in the economic zone, adding that debts had been increased, thus putting the country on the grey list, while it was heading towards the black list due to the inefficiency of the bureaucracy of the federation and the province.
 Shakoor said the quota system had caused irreparable damage to the whole nation, the economy of the country and the entire public, adding that the country ranked the lowest when compared to others in economy, education, health, science, development, etc.
 He requested the court to declare the quota system illegal because it had expired, and to direct the federal and provincial governments to cancel all appointments made on quota after 2013 and to fill the vacant slots again on the basis of merit through open competition.
 After the preliminary hearing of the petition, the SHC’s division bench headed by Justice Nadeem Akhtar issued notices to the attorney generals of Pakistan and Sindh with the direction to file comments by January 18.

Most dramatic, however, is the narrative’s chilling reminder of how a lack of accountability over the Armenian genocide led Adolf Hitler to believe that the world would also turn a blind eye to his “Final Solution.”

Achiuwa, who was selected with the 20th overall pick in last months' draft, scored all of his points Monday from around the basket. Each of his four made baskets came from inside the restricted area, as he had success rolling to the basket after screening for teammates.
 "His energy rolling to the rim was contagious," Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. "I think he sparked us for a couple minutes. Defensively, you see some of his ability to cover ground and do multiple things guarding multiple positions, protecting the basket. He just has to continue every day to learn NBA situations and learn our system, learn how to communicate these things and then do it consistently every time.
 "But he has had a good camp. It's not easy for any rookie right now league wide without summer league and the normal September ramp-up, but he is making the absolutely most of every minute he's in the gym here."
 Consistent playing time will have to be earned by Achiuwa in his rookie season. The Heat has a crowded power rotation led by Adebayo, which also features established veterans like 6-11 center Kelly Olynyk and 7-footer Meyers Leonard.
 Achiuwa admitted "everything was kind of moving fast at first" in his first NBA minutes Monday, and finding easy baskets as the roll man was his way of slowing things down for himself.
 "Those were very important plays," Achiuwa said. "It's my first game out there and I was just trying to do whatever to get in the flow of the game. Everything was kind of moving fast at first. I understand certain screens are going to get the ball-handler open or get me open, just to get myself in the flow of the game. That's what I kept doing the whole time, just to slow the game down for myself."
 Late in Monday's preseason opener, Heat veteran Udonis Haslem and Adebayo pulled Achiuwa to the side during a timeout to review a teaching point they noticed. It was just a glimpse at what has been going on behind the scenes and in practices.
 "They're always in my ear constantly, both of them," Achiuwa said. "Always talking to me, trying to get me acclimated to the game and the speed of the game and the terminology and everything going on. It's pretty much the same thing that they've been echoing in practice since I've been out here. Just trying to reinforce the same things over and over and over again, and just try to help me understand the game a little better."
