The US reported more than 55,000 new Covid-19 cases on Thursday, a new daily global record for the coronavirus pandemic, as infections rose in a majority of states. A surge in coronavirus cases over the past week has put President Donald Trump’s handling of the crisis under the microscope and led several governors to halt plans to reopen their states after strict lockdowns. The daily US tally stood at 55,274 late Thursday, topping the previous single-day record of 54,771 set by Brazil on June 19. Coronavirus cases are rising in 37 out of 50 US states including Florida, which confirmed more than 10,000 new cases on Thursday. That marked the state’s largest daily spike so far and a level that exceeded single-day tallies from any European country at the height of the outbreak there. California, another epicentre, saw positive tests climb 37% with hospitalisations up 56% over the past two weeks. Texas governor Greg Abbott, a Republican who has previously resisted calls to make face masks mandatory, on Thursday ordered them to be worn in all counties with over 20 coronavirus cases. “In the past few weeks, there has been a swift and substantial spike in coronavirus cases,” Abbott said in a videotaped message. “We need to refocus on slowing the spread. But this time, we want to do it without closing down Texas again.” Texas reported nearly 8,000 new cases on Thursday. New infections were rising in 37 out of 50 US states in the past 14 days compared with the two weeks prior, according to a Reuters analysis. The US has now recorded nearly 129,000 deaths, nearly a quarter of the known global total. The wave of new cases has several governors halting or back-pedalling on plans to reopen their states after months of strict lockdowns, closing beaches and canceling fireworks displays over the upcoming Independence Day weekend. ‘STILL IN THE FIRST WAVE’ “We are not out of this crisis. We are still in the first wave of this crisis. It requires some level of personal responsibility,” California governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, said at a daily briefing on the pandemic. Earlier on Thursday, Kansas required face coverings after a 46% spike in infections there last week. Reuters

We went from a high-yielding stock in CenturyLink to a steady grower with a small payout in Sirius XM Holdings. Let's wrap things up by going for a fast- growing mobile gaming company in Zynga. If you spend any time on your smartphone, you've probably dabbled with some of Zynga's sticky casual diversions. It's the publisher of _Empires & Puzzles_, _Merge Dragons!_ , and _Words With Friends_. If those games don't ring a bell, Zynga's long track record of hits stretches back to the early days of social gaming with _FarmVille_ and _Mafia Wars_.

The Tourism Department has put the brakes on its drive to revive the sector in view of the surge in COVID-19 cases in the State. Many of the campaigns especially designed to encourage limited travel, including ‘Love Your Local’ to urge people to visit places of tourist interest within their city or district, too have been put on the back burner for now.
 A senior official in the department admitted that they were going slow on tourism promotion as holiday and leisure activity was not considered a priority in view of the changing situation and surge in cases. “The thrust is on safety and and tourism could be blamed in case of a community spread and hence the cautious approach,” the official added. There have been instances of locals resenting influx of tourists into their regions given the fear of the pandemic.
 When contacted, Kumar Pushkar, MD, KSTDC, said the promotional activity has been a low key affair in view of the evolving situation. Besides, a few properties of the KSTDC across the State will be used for institutional quarantine, he added. He said the decision of the authorities in different districts dealing with the pandemic has to be respected and there cannot be mass promotion or mass tourism under the current circumstances. He added the unlocking since June 8, 2020, was to kickstart economic activity essential for sustenance leading to gradual recovery and once the situation attained near normalcy and stabilised the promotional drive too would pick up.
