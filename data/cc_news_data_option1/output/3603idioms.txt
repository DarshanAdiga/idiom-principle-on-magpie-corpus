Now, after weeks of planning, the athletics department has found ways to still possibly play games this semester through guidelines set by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The one drawback, however, is that everything will have to go perfectly, to a tee, if teams are indeed going to hit the fields this semester.

But armed with a bag packed with gear, and given his extensive training and experience, Harvey said he "was never worried."
 As the darkness settled in, Harvey turned to his "Plan B," he said. The spot where he had gotten separated from his partner was desolate, so he looked for a new, safe place to set up camp.
 He'd end up solo camping for three nights and four days — an overall nice experience, he said after his rescue, though he did fall in a stream and scrape his forehead.
 "I had three really good, wild camping nights where I was on my own and had all the kit I needed," Harvey said in the news conference. His only issue was a shortage of food. "I've got a hell of an appetite," he said, smiling. "And when I get hungry I've got to get something to eat or I cannot go anywhere."
 Meanwhile, mountain rescuers, police, the Royal Air Force, and locals had been searching for Harvey since Sunday. The group included 60 trained search-and- rescue volunteers and seven search-and-rescue dog handlers, ITV reported.
 Harvey said he saw helicopters and a few people walking in the distance, but didn't realize they were part of a search team looking for him. He said he blew his emergency whistle, but the people apparently didn't hear it.

One of the world's rarest diamonds, about the size of an egg or a large lollipop, is going up for auction next month and is expected to fetch $12 million to $30 million.Sotheby's said on Thursday that the 102.39-carat diamond, a flawless white sparkler, was the second-largest oval diamond of its kind to be offered at auction. The largest, a 118.28-carat diamond, set a record $30.8 million price when it was sold in 2013.Reuters This gem was cut from a 271-carat rough. Only seven such diamonds, known in the trade as D color flawless or internally flawless white diamonds, over 100 carats have previously been sold at auction."More and more people have come to understand that something billions of years old and of the size of a lollipop can store as much value as a Rembrandt self-portrait or a Basquiat," Gary Schuler, worldwide chairman of jewelry at Sotheby's, said in a statement.The diamond will be sold in a single-lot action without a reserve price at Sotheby's in Hong Kong on October 5. Reuters This gem is expected to fetch $12 million to $30 million."Diamonds of this caliber and size have sold anywhere between $11.9 million to $33.7 million," said Quig Bruning, head of Sotheby's New York jewelry department.Sotheby's said the gem was cut from a 271-carat rough that was discovered at the Victor Mine in the Canadian province of Ontario in 2018 and cut and polished for more than a year.Two of the most famous large diamonds - the Koh-i-Noor and The Cullinan 1 - belong to the British monarchy and form part of the British Crown Jewels.The world record for any diamond or jewel sold at auction was set in 2017 when a 59.60-carat fancy vivid pink diamond was sold for $71.2 million to the Hong Kong jewelry company Chow Tai Fook, Sotheby's said.

E-commerce giant Amazon has hung the 'Now Hiring' sign at its doors as it announces as many as 33,000 job openings. Up for grabs are corporate and tech positions supporting areas that include Alexa, AWS, Operations Technology, and Prime Video, the company said in a statement on September 9.
 Amazon also said it will soon announce thousands of additional hourly roles in its operations network.

“Rhode Island College, their president, Dr. Sanchez, is the chair of the athletic committee in the [LEC], and he himself is a former student-athlete, so he really understands it,” Racicot said. “He and President Treadwell have worked well together all summer. And the state of Rhode Island, they have taken a very measured and guided approach, and institutionally they have been fully committed to the level of testing for students and student-athletes to remain safe. So they are definitely within that conversation of schools that we would be able to potentially compete with. The athletic director there, Don Tencher, has been fully on board, working toward that goal as well, and at Plymouth it’s the same thing. So it’s an open dialogue. But there’s still just so many questions. I’d like to be able to say, ‘Hey, October 15 we’re playing these guys,’ but we’re not quite there yet.”

So, it’s all over the map that way, but again, we’re not going to do anything that puts our students at risk and puts campus in jeopardy.”

SAN FRANCISCO — Mike Yastrzemski hit a three-run homer as the San Francisco Giants defeated the Seattle Mariners 10-1 for their fifth straight win Wednesday under skies turned orange by raging wildfires in Northern California.
 Players took batting practice with the lights turned on at Oracle Park on a late-summer afternoon. Some ash flakes rained down on the ballpark and the smell of smoke was noticeable but not overpowering.
 “Certainly, it’s a strange look when we all woke up this morning and found the orangish-red hue to the sky,” Giants manager Gabe Kapler said.
 “Walking onto the field today was certainly different in the middle of the afternoon and having the sky look a little bit dark, but my understanding is the air quality is OK and of course we’ll keep tabs on it and if anything changes we’ll make the best decisions for the health and well-being of our players,” he said.
 Tyler Anderson (2-3) pitched six shutout innings of three-hit ball for the win. The left-hander struck out four and walked one as he won for the first time in three starts since pitching his first career complete game Aug. 22 against Arizona.
 Mariners starter Nick Margevicius (1-3) struck out six his first time through the order before the Giants broke through in the bottom of the third of a scoreless game. He gave up a season-high seven runs in 4ž innings.

It would be recalled that when news broke that Joe Mettle was planning to tie the knot with Salomey, Instagram blogger Aba The Great disclosed that Joe Mettle was forced to marry her because she was pregnant.      This rumour became serious after a video surfaced of her with a supposed baby bump weeks ago.      According to her, the family of Salomey together with some church elders of the Gospel musician forced him to marry her to avoid bringing shame to them.      She also alledged that Salomey has other children but Joe Mettle only got to know about it after their marriage.      Well, its been weeks since they married and Salomey has come out for the first time to talk about everything and all the accusations from Aba and other people.

Early on Tuesday, Phil Harvey and his wife gathered a group of mountain rescuers and camera crews at the Tan Hill Inn pub in northeast England to make a public plea for help finding Phil's 80-year-old father, who had gone missing while hiking in the nearby Yorkshire Dales.
 But the event quickly turned into a tearful reunion when the missing man himself, Harry Harvey, showed up at a news conference about his disappearance. Harvey said he had no idea that a search party had spent four days looking for him.
 "If I'd have known, I wouldn't have come back — not here," he said, jokingly, at the news conference, which was broadcast by the inn on Facebook Live, adding that he would have found another way to get home so he could have avoided all the attention. "I could do without all of this."
 Rescuers credited Harvey's years of mountain hiking experience and good equipment for seeing him safely through the four days.
 "This morning, we did not expect to have this result. We really thought we were looking for an unfortunate end to this matter," a member of the Swaledale Mountain Rescue Team told ITV.
 Harvey was separated from his walking partner Saturday afternoon after getting caught in a hailstorm with a "howling gale of wind," he said, while hiking in the national park, which is 860 square miles of countryside with lush valleys, a limestone cave and historic castles.
