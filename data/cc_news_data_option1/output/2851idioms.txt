In Sumter County, the biggest of three counties where most of The Villages is concentrated, the number of cases ballooned from 68 in the first week of June to more than 270 last week, according to the county’s Health Department.
 The Villages is a sprawling palm-tree-lined complex so big it has three ZIP codes, 12 golf courses and multiple libraries and movie theaters, drawing affluent retirees from all over the country.
 Now many residents are confronting their new reality. “It’s seeping in, no matter what,” Rob Hannon, 64, said as he sipped a beer, adding that “friends that would come down for years are saying, ‘We’re not going to go.’”
 The golf course is still crowded, he said, as well as the hair salon where his wife, Michelle, 53, works. “The women are still coming in but they’re a little more anxious,” Rob Hannon said. “You can’t stop living. But you can stop being cavalier.”
 In an email to residents last week, Jeffrey Lowenkron, the chief medical officer of The Villages, said cases were increasing and urged them to take “proactive steps to reduce the risk of disease transmission.”
 “They should consider postponing participation in social events with more than 10 people, particularly those events held indoors,” he wrote. “The upward trend is accelerating.”
 That The Villages had initially seemed to escape the worst of the virus had been a point of pride for Gov. Ron DeSantis. The governor, a Republican who has strong support from the community, brushed off concerns about the risks during a visit in April. “There were articles written saying, ‘Oh, The Villages is going to crash and burn,’” he said. “They have like a 2% or 2.5% infection rate.”
 But when he returned early in July, the infection rate had jumped to 9%.

For business owners trying to chart the future — whether they’re the fifth generation or the second — Pendergast recommends that they find someone who can be their “truth teller,” who will look at the numbers and the emotions of continuing. If the math doesn’t work and the business isn’t viable, there’s no point in keeping it alive. But if it is, then she encourages owners to ask themselves if the work is still meaningful to the family.
 “Obligation cannot be the reason to continue,” she said. “Long term, that is not sustainable.”
 Amy Hyman feels that obligation daily as she tries to guide Lake Steam Baths in Denver into its 94th year in business.
 Like Harrell, she never expected to find herself at the helm of a legacy business. She was happy with her job tending the bar where she met her husband, Hannon. The Russian and Turkish bathhouse was the domain of her mother-in-law, Gertie.
 “She was 5-foot-nothing,” Hyman said. “This little Jewish lady running around telling everyone what to do. That’s my fondest memory of this place — not ever knowing that I would be her someday, in a sense.”
 When Gertie died in 2006, Hannon took over — with some input from Hyman. Women had never been allowed in the baths. But Hyman persuaded Hannon to let her test a ladies’ night one Sunday a month so that women could enjoy the hot saunas and whirlpools, and get a massage.
 She continued bartending and raising her daughter and son while Hannon ran the business. But when he died in 2015, at age 59, Hyman found herself in charge because no other family members were available.
 “Never did I ever believe that I would be running the business by myself,” Hyman said. “My two kids were 14 and 10 when Hannon passed, and every year I kept saying, ‘I’m going to sell this place and live life.’ But I can’t. The community is amazing.”

“We can’t pass the bill in the Senate without the Democrats and we’re going to talk to them as well,” McConnell agreed.
 The package from McConnell had been quietly crafted behind closed doors for weeks and was expected to include $75 billion to help schools reopen, reduced unemployment benefits and a fresh round of direct $1,200 cash payments to Americans, and a sweeping five-year liability shield against coronavirus lawsuits.
 But as the administration was panning some $25 billion in proposed new funds for testing and tracing, said one Republican familiar with the discussions. Trump was also reviving his push for a payroll tax break, which was being seriously considered, said another Republican. Both spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private talks.
 Trump insisted again Sunday that the virus would “disappear,” but the president’s view did not at all match projections from the leading health professionals straining to halt the alarming U.S. caseload and death toll.

He said the problem had been compounded by the lack of fundraising options available at a time when social gatherings are subject to public health restrictions.
 “All the traditional things we have had in the past, dinners and things like that, we can’t do,” he said. “The options are to beg, which is what I have been doing since March 15.”
 The Archdiocese of New York stretches from Staten Island to the Hudson Valley, excluding Brooklyn and Queens, and its population is more than half Catholic. It is one of the most populous and influential districts of the church in the United States.
 But the area around St. Patrick’s Cathedral has been transformed by the pandemic.
 Stores like Saks Fifth Avenue, just to the south, were boarded up during the looting that marred racial injustice protests in June. Across Fifth Avenue lies the normally bustling plaza of Rockefeller Center, where the crowds are gone and the statue of Prometheus sits perched above the ice skating rink with a mask strapped across his face.
 The archdiocese does not pay for the cathedral’s upkeep, and in fact the opposite is true: St. Patrick’s Cathedral is organized as a parish, similar to a neighborhood church in a more residential area, and it pays an 8% tax to the archdiocese.
 Like any other Catholic parish, the cathedral relies heavily on donations collected at Mass to make ends meet. On a typical Sunday, 12,000 to 15,000 people attend Mass in its soaring nave. Before the pandemic, income from a variety of sources amounted to roughly $1 million a month, Ritchie said.
 “We rely on the goodness and generosity of people to support us because we don’t get any money from any other source beside what comes in through our doors,” he said.

In a news conference last week, Thomas Bach, the president of the IOC, said that planning for the games now involves multiple options. All of them, he said, prioritize the health of the athletes.
 “It includes all different countermeasures,” Bach said of the planning. “An Olympic Games behind closed doors is clearly something we do not want. We are working for a solution that safeguards the health of all the participants and is also reflecting of the Olympic spirit.”
 Bach has said a further postponement is not an option at the moment; if the games cannot be held next summer, they will not be held at all.

Agriculture Secretary Russell Redding reminded Pennsylvanians — from kids and parents, to homeowners, to farmers — the importance of taking steps to protect our valuable population of pollinators to protect the future of food security.
 “Many people are afraid of bees — they’ve got a scary stinger that some people are allergic to, but did you know that one out of every third bite of food you take is thanks to a pollinator?” said Secretary Redding. “Think twice before you swat them and consider what you can do to safeguard them and help their colonies flourish. Because when pollinators flourish, so does our food supply.”
 Earlier this week, Department of Agriculture Deputy Secretary Cheryl Cook and State Apiarist Karen Roccasecca joined The GIANT Company at their headquarters in Carlisle at their new, seven-acre pollinator field. The all native meadow will create a habitat for pollinators, birds, and other small wildlife while improving the quality of the soil and reducing runoff.

The researchers found that during the lockdown, the rate of babies born before 28 weeks had dropped by a startling 90%.
 Anecdotes from doctors at other hospitals around the world suggest the phenomenon may have been widespread, though not universal.
 Dr. Belal Alshaikh, a neonatologist at the University of Calgary in Alberta, Canada, said premature births across Calgary dropped by nearly half during the lockdown. The change was across the board, though it seemed more pronounced in the earliest babies, he said.
 At Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, Dr. Irwin Reiss, a neonatologist, saw a smaller drop-off in premature births.
