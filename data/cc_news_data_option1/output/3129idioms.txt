“His recovery from the stroke has been very good but his left side is affected so he can't do the things that he used to do. He feels all right in himself, but he is just frustrated. At the moment he is keeping quite well, his speech isn't very good but we are grateful for the time we've got really."
 His friend Dave Tilling, 70, a fellow member of the G Scale Society, said he he was "honoured" to be asked by his long-time friend to finish the project.
 The grandad-of-three, and retired maintenance engineer for the NHS, of Yardley, Birmingham, said: "This is a one-of-a-kind model as far as we know. It has been built entirely from scratch, its costs a few hundred quid it parts but might be worth thousands now.
 "John spotted the challenge in one of our journals last winter, which get published four times a year. He has visited the Wuppertal Railway and wanted to give it a go. It was a real challenge to build it. John as a model maker is not just good, he is fantastic. He makes everything from scratch. He makes his own moulds. The quality is just second to none.

My first kitchen job involved making six gallons of gazpacho every Sunday. This was back when earning your chops meant something, and making that whole batch with just a knife and peeler, no blender, was the most tedious task on my list. It was also the most popular dish on the menu. By the time I'd learned that recipe -- straight out of the "Moosewood Cookbook" -- by heart, I figured I knew everything there was to know about cold Spanish soups.      When I finally made it to Spain, reality set in on many levels. Sangria, it turns out, is just for tourists, while the locals drink a mix of red wine and Sprite called tinto de verano.      Spanish gazpacho, meanwhile, is a lot smoother than my chunky hippie version. And because it's so involved to make, with an entire garden's worth of vegetables to prepare, gazpacho is often reserved for special occasions like Sundays or when company comes over. When the average Spaniard wants to whip up a quick cold soup at home, or have a chilled bowl at the local bar, it's much more likely to be salmorejo.   Just tomatoes, garlic, oil, vinegar, salt and bread crumbs, a much pared-down cast compared to gazpacho, in salmorejo we are free to focus all of our attention on the tomato.      It has a creamy red look, and a body that jiggles like sea foam thanks to the emulsion among tomato, oil and vinegar, and thickened by the tomato-soaked bread. Some recipes call for the "guts" of a baguette; I've also had good luck cutting the edges off a slice of bread -- usually white but whole grain adds a fun heartiness once in a while.      High-acid, normal-looking red tomatoes are traditionally used, but some of my best batches have been mutts, medleys of whatever heirlooms, slicers, cherry and paste tomatoes are getting too soft for salad.      I was in Spain when COVID-19 hit. On the last afternoon before the lockdown, it didn't quite seem real. In Lanjaron, a cute mountain village in Andalusia, it was business and leisure as usual. As my kids enjoyed a playground that would be roped off for months the very next morning, I ducked into a cafe just ahead of a tour bus from Madrid, and ordered a bowl of salmorejo. It came out immediately, garnished with chopped hard boiled egg and jamon -- Spanish cured ham.      I didn't realize it at the time, but that typical bowl of everyday salmorejo would be my last taste of normalcy for months, not to mention my last restaurant meal. Cooped in our rented house during the lockdown, I began to understand the wisdom of keeping a pitcher of salmorejo in the fridge. It was as much an act of preparation for the inevitable heat of the day as a response to the ever-accumulating soft tomatoes and stale bread, one problem solving another.      Here is a boilerplate salmorejo recipe. Tweak it to suit your own whims and tastes -- but only adjust the levels of the called-for ingredients. If you start adding things, you'll have bready gazpacho in no time.      Salmorejo   Serves 4   • 2 pounds tomatoes   • 1/2 cup "bread guts" -- roughly a slice of bread with the crust cut off   • 1 modest sized clove garlic, chopped   • 2 teaspoons sherry vinegar (more to taste if your tomatoes are low-acid)   • ½ teaspoon salt + more to taste   • ½ cup extra virgin olive oil   • Garnish: hard boiled egg, chopped ham, olive oil, parsley, chives      Boil a pot of salted water deep enough to submerge your tomatoes.      While the water heats, cut a cross into the bottom of each tomato to slice the skins. Then chop the bread.      Boil the tomatoes in the water for about 2 minutes, then immediately plunge them into an ice bath until they are completely cool. Remove the tomatoes and pull off the skins. If you want to go the extra mile, cut open the tomatoes and remove the seeds. (And if you want to slack, you can skip peeling the tomatoes).      Liquify the tomatoes in a blender for about 30 seconds. Add the bread and liquify again. Let the blended bread sit for about 5 minutes in the blended tomatoes.      Add the garlic, salt, vinegar and oil. Blend on high for a minute. Check seasonings; blend again if you made any adjustments.      Chill. Garnish with chopped hard boiled egg and jamon if you want to be traditional. More casually, a simple splash of olive oil or sprinkle of fresh parsley will complete the dish.

Special to The Journal-Standard
   
 The real estate market in Freeport is changing. For quite a long time, Freeport has primarily been a buyer's market and that is no longer the case. The local market has been busy and we are experiencing a low inventory of homes for sale.
   
 I'm sure you have all heard on the news about how hot the Rockford market has become, but generally Freeport does not enjoy the same level of activity. This summer has been one of the busiest I can remember in my almost 30 years in this market!
   
 If you are thinking of selling, I'm sure you are happy to hear that news! There is definitely a shortage of certain types of homes on the market right now, especially mid-price ranches and condos. If you are an owner of one of those, now might be the time to take the plunge and get your home on the market.
   
 It is already August, and before you know it Labor Day has come and gone and fall is here. Usually our market tends to slow around Thanksgiving and drops off pretty significantly during the winter months. This has been a very unusual year so it's hard to predict what will happen in a few months. COVID-19 has thrown all of us into uncharted territory so our "normal" market pattern is now completely unpredictable.
   
 If you are selling your home now, inventory is low and there is a large pool of buyers out there looking for the best home they can find in their price range. If you are priced properly and your home is in good condition you probably won't be on the market for long. Interest rates are the best they have been, and buyers want to find a home and get their rate locked in before they start to inch upward again.
   
 If you are a buyer looking for a home, it is very important that you put yourself in the best position to be able to make a winning offer. The most important thing you can do is visit your lender and get pre-approved before you start your home search. I can't stress this part enough! It is vital that you know you can qualify for a mortgage and exactly what you can afford before you start looking.
   
 Our market is very active, and if you find your dream house and haven't been to the bank yet, by the time you get that process complete your dream home will be someone else's! You also want to be looking in the correct price range. You may think you can qualify for a certain price home, but in reality you might be qualified for much more or much less. You can save everyone a lot of time and disappointment if you have a pre-approval before you start your home search.
   
 Buyers may also need to adjust their thinking about the market in Freeport. Sellers are no longer desperately waiting for any offer to come in and willing to take much less than asking price. The days of low-ball offers are gone. If you are looking at a property and you think you can "just try" a low offer to see what will happen, you may get outbid and not have a chance to even come back with a higher offer. I have seen many clients very disappointed about missing out on a house they really wanted because they insisted on starting out with a low offer, only to be outbid by another buyer.
   
 Your Realtor can advise you on what kind of offer to make because they know the local market and the value of the homes in this area. Listen to their advice and you will have a much better chance at making a winning offer.
   
 We are actually seeing multiple offers on properties and some are even selling over asking price. This is not the norm in our market so buyers need to re- educate themselves on home values and be prepared to pay close to or more than asking price.
   
 As of the end of July, there were 77 active homes and condos on the market in Freeport. That is a very low number. So far this year, sales are up almost 23% in Stephenson County from where they were last year at this time according to Illinois Realtors market data.
   
 The median sales price in Stephenson County is also up about 6% from the same time last year. This is all good news for our local economy and we certainly hope this trend continues. So if you are thinking of selling, now is a great time and if you are thinking of buying get pre-approved first, then call your local Realtor!
