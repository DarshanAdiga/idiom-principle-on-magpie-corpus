 "We received the bad news the other day but I think everyone within Leeds United and all of the fans remember him.
 "He is part of the history of this club and I think these three points are for everybody and for the fans but especially for him and for his memory.
 "I am sure he will help us in the next week's games from the sky and this win is for him."

Whether you're watching it for the first time or the 10th, if you're planning to stream Hamilton on Disney Plus this weekend, you probably already know that the award-winning lyrics fly fast and furious. They're crammed with references to historical moments and musical theater, packed tight with zingers and digs. To get the most out of the cultural phenomenon that is Hamilton, you need to capture every lyric.
 If your ears are like a sieve, good luck parsing all of Lafayette's 32 words rapped in 6 seconds in Guns and Ships, a number on the Revolutionary war. Even after listening to the original Broadway cast recording on Spotify multiple times ( _and_ the Hamilton Mix Tape of celebrity covers) and watching the movie musical twice, it can still be tricky to grasp every word of every rap battle.

 Fortunately, there's a simple tool within Disney Plus that'll help you keep up with the lyrics so you don't miss a beat: the Subtitles tool.

 Here's how to turn on closed captioning on Disney Plus.

 Meanwhile Exeter Chiefs have announced new contracts for 30 squad members following the salary cap cut agreed last month. The likes of England trio Jack Nowell, Henry Slade and Luke Cowan-Dickie, as well as Scotland skipper Stuart Hogg, are among those to have signed long-term deals at Sandy Park.
 Premiership Rugby clubs came to an agreement in June to slash their salary cap by £1.4million in the wake of the financial damage cast upon the sport by the coronavirus pandemic.
 The Gallagher Premiership is set to resume in August.
 The new salary cap comes into effect from the 2021/22 campaign and Exeter have wasted no time in making sure they fall in line.
 "I'm delighted with what has happened," Chiefs' director of rugby Rob Baxter said.
 "It seems strange really, because there has been an awful lot of news coming out from other clubs in regards what is happening around pay cuts, players leaving, players staying, yet we have got on with our business pretty quickly.
 "They are all different and not one of them is the same. It's meant us having individual discussions with players and agents, but in the end I feel like we've all got what we need out of it."
