Early voting and voting on Election Day will be a little different this year with coronavirus still a concern, and as the city plans to have poll workers wiping down areas in-between each voter.
 "We did just get a huge shipment from the state of all PPE, masks, hand sanitizer, wipes," said Holyoke City Clerk Brenna Murphy McGee.
 In Massachusetts, early voting begins on Saturday, October 17. Folks in Holyoke can go to Holyoke City Hall to cast their ballots. McGee told Western Mass News early voting is the way to go if you’re trying to avoid the long lines.

Crappie are good on minnows and jigs staying to humps, brush, and covered water. White bass are fair with Alabama rigs on the rocks and points. Catfish are fair on live and prepped baits.

Scifres’ sixth punt came from his own 47 with 2:50 remaining and the Colts holding a 17-14 lead. It squirted out of bounds at the 1. When Peyton Manning was unable to move the chains – a third-down sack was the killer – the Chargers took advantage of choice field position – first-and-10 at the Indy 38 following Hunter Smith’s 63-yard punt and Sproles’ 36-yard return – to tie the game on Nate Kaeding’s 26-yard field goal with 31 seconds remaining.

Whatever the reason, it appears the boom had more bark than bite, and no reports of damage or injuries have been tallied.

SPRINGFIELD, MA (WGGB/WSHM) -- The Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH) released a full graphical map detailing every city and town's average incidence rate based on positive COVID-19 cases released over the last two weeks, per every 100,000.
 One western Mass. community, Springfield, is in the red, which means a high risk of spreading COVID-19. Springfield was in the yellow in the DPH's report last week.
 The mayor's office confirmed to Western Mass News that due to this latest development the city will not be permitted to continuing to Phase III Part II of the state's reopening plan.
 Here is the latest map of Springfield, which the DPH reports had 221 positive tests in the last 14 days:

Hilton has at least one sack and one interception in each of his four seasons, and has already managed to do that in just three games this year. His career- high in interceptions, however, is just two, which he had in his first season. Back at the start of September, he said he was hoping to get at least three or four this year. He also had four sacks that season, and I’m sure he’s looking to pass that mark as well.

“I would say if you don’t want to risk waiting in line on Election Day, coming to City Hall during those 14 days at your convenience is probably the way to go," she explained.
 Despite the anticipation of waiting in line longer than usual, one Holyoke voter said he has prepared. He plans to hit the polls on Election Day, November 3.
 "Nah, there’s never a guarantee. There never has been," said Holyoke resident Charles Croston. "I mean, I waited in line years ago for an hour. So it's just a matter of time.”
 McGee said she has staffers ready to go for Election Day, but if you choose to go to the polls on Election Day instead of early voting, expect a wait. She also said typically, on Election Day, they have about 10 voting booths at each precinct, but in a COVID-19 world, they plan to have four or five per location.
 “I think if people go to the polls to vote, people might have to expect to have to wait in line," she said. "That line could be outside the building, just for us to prevent too much crowding going on in the polling locations.”
 Again, early voting in the Bay State starts Saturday, October 17, and goes through October 30.

NBCSN has a tripleheader on Sunday and on Saturday, one game will air on NBCSN and one will air on NBC.

A woman who had been missing for two years was found floating in the ocean. Her alleged story of how she came to be drifting in the sea is horrific, and her own daughter disputes the claims. Other than being in shock when she arrived at the hospital, the woman is reportedly in good health. If a person is rescued at sea, it's often because of some seriously unfortunate circumstances that played out over the course of hours or perhaps days. A boat capsizing and leaving its passengers to fend for themselves on the waves isn't super common, but it does happen from time to time.

And what a goal to start in the 11th minute.

 But it only took them 25 seconds of the second half for them to get level.
 And it was a super strike from Robert Snodgrass after Felipe Anderson slid the ball out to him.
 But Everton were back in front soon after thanks to a bit of fortune as Richarlison's deflected strike off Declan Rice left Randolph with no chance in the 56th minute.
 Jordan Pickford did have to be alert to deny Sebastian Haller's scissor kick before Calvert-Lewin secured the win with 12 minutes to go when he tapped home after Alex Iwobi's shot hit the post.

FALCON: FAIR. Water lightly stained north and clear south; 84 degrees; 37.12' low. There is not a ton of traffic on the lake, but rain, white bass, and crappie are here to catch in bunches. Black bass are fair with submerged houses, natural formations, and brush piles. You just got to keep moving. Most catches come on the first cast, and the hotspots aren't holding more than one or two black bass. The black bass haven't made a big push shallower quite yet. Large plastic worms and plastic crawfish are great if you can find them with a few supply issues, and square billed crankbaits have been good, especially on the rocks where you will also catch some white bass. The white bass are great on the rocks on crankbait. Crappie are excellent over brush piles. Catfish are always biting, and constant cloudy water help. Remember to stay on the Texas side unless you possess a Mexican fishing license.
