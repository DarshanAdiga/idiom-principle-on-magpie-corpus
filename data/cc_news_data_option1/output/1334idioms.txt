Calls for national register amid fears up to a third of tradework during lockdown isn't essential

In New Hampshire, florists, garden centers and plant nurseries are considered essential businesses. In many states, more than you might imagine, golf courses are open as an essential outdoor recreation activity.
 Recreational marijuana dispensaries are deemed essential in some states where people are forbidden to eat in restaurants or imbibe in bars. Gun stores are essential in many states. Where they're not, lawsuits have swiftly followed.
 Liquor stores are essential businesses almost everywhere - almost because of Pennsylvania, where they're not.
 During the coronavirus pandemic, all states are not equal.
 One state's weed is another states's posies.
 We're in the middle of an "essential" crisis. The definition of that word dictates how we will live for our unforeseeable future. Some decisions will surely clog the courts. Meanwhile, essential versus nonessential workers has become the new caste system.
 There is some consensus these days on what we need, essentially, to live. We need food, though perhaps not as many carbs as new homebound bread obsessives are baking. We need access to health care and meds and 24-roll packs of toilet paper. Hardware stores are necessary to keep shelters in place. Laundromats are essential for people without laundries. Our pets' well-being, even those of aging, indifferent, decidedly nocturnal felines? Essential. We need gas to anxiously drive to these places. In cities, we require bike-repair shops so we can safely perambulate to them.
 Then things get muddy.
 Many decisions are left to governors, in consultation with state health officials, as well as mayors and county executives. What is considered an essential business or service can even vary from municipality to municipality within a state, since density poses greater risk.
 Unsurprisingly, there is discord between some governors and mayors, particularly when they are members of opposing parties, sometimes when they are not.
 A beauty of an intrastate battle raged in Arizona over salon services. Republican Gov. Doug Ducey declared "personal hygiene services," such as hair and nail salons, essential.
 He did not clarify why. The very nature of "personal hygiene" requires proximity. Try snipping locks or lacquering nails at the recommended safe distance of six feet.
 Arizona's Democratic mayors lashed out at Ducey for being too lax and imposed more austere guidelines. He responded by barring them from enforcing stricter orders than the state. When he issued a state stay-at-home order Monday, personal hygiene services remained on the list of essential businesses.
 "I don't know what message it sends when manicures are essential," Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego told a local radio station. "There are so many holes in this you can drive a freight train through it."
 On Friday, Ducey told the salons to close.
 Times are tense. Politics are constant. Logic is often elusive. Battles are bound to occur in matters concerning religious freedom, the Second Amendment, alcohol, marijuana and now, it seems, hair and nails. (Not to mention abortion, which some states are deeming an unnecessary procedure.)
 "States in our federal system are sovereign governments. They have sovereign powers, and these sovereign powers are profound," says Arizona State law professor James Hodge, director of the Center for Public Health Law and Policy. "One of the core mandates of that power is to protect the public's health."
 Ordinarily, natural disasters like hurricanes, floods or wildfires strike a specific state or region. "But never before in modern history have all 50 states simultaneously declared an emergency," Hodge says.
 During the pandemic, regional distinctions fall by the wayside, with contiguous states often going their own way. Some states, like Arkansas, North Dakota and South Dakota, have yet to issue stay-at-home ordinances or restrict businesses (at least as of press time). Asked why florists are considered essential in New Hampshire, a spokesman for Republican Gov. Chris Sununu cited funerals.
 "In many ways, it is a virtue and a tribute to the way we make decisions about public safety on a local level," says Robert Inman, a professor emeritus of finance at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. "Do you worry a lot about close contact in Montana the way you might worry about in New York City? Implementation is going to vary community to community based on geography and how people live their lives."
 Essential has become an elastic concept - not just a state classification but a philosophical question. Is takeout essential? At the supermarket, where we put ourselves at risk for germs and contact anxiety, is that fifth box of penne essential, that second bag of Funyuns?
 Is it essential to keep ordering more stuff, especially when the essential stuff, like thermometers, is back-ordered until June? Amazon warehouse workers in Michigan walked off the job Wednesday, requesting that the facility be closed. They protested filling nonessential orders and, in a video that went viral, sex toys in particular.
 Amazon told The Washington Post in a statement that "we're not stopping or slowing down orders where we already have stock and where those orders do not prevent us from shipping priority items." (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Post.)
 At some organizations, nonessential employees have been laid off. At shuttered Disney theme parks, nonessential staffers learned Thursday they will be furloughed April 19. In other companies, "nonessential" means working from home in soft pants and socks, and may be preferable to "essential," which requires reporting to offices.
 But state orders are where the most confounding conflicts reside. Despite mounting coronavirus cases and criticism for failing to curtail spring-break revelry, Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis did not issue a "safer at home" order and declare state beaches closed until Wednesday. Miami Beach and Fort Lauderdale closed their seashores back in mid-March.
 Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer banned gatherings of more than 50, but she exempted places of worship, as have several other governors.
 States can't agree on size. Many prohibit groups of more than 10 residents, consistent with the Trump administration's recommendation. Connecticut and Rhode Island limit groups to five. Penalties are in place in some states, like Oregon, for violating stay-at-home orders, including up to 30 days in jail. Then again, jails pose a greater risk of the virus spreading for violators and law enforcement.
 California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom views gun stores as nonessential, leaving discretion up to county law enforcement. Gun rights activists filed a federal lawsuit. New York Democratic Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo viewed gun stores as nonessential. The NRA filed suit there, too.
 Orders are changing by the day, even hourly. "Some of the leeway makes sense, and some of it doesn't at all," says Jennifer Tolbert, the Kaiser Family Foundation's director of state health reform, who is constantly updating state actions.
 The situation remains fluid, even in alcohol-restricted Pennsylvania, where the state controls sales.
 On March 17, Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf closed the nearly 600 state liquor stores and ceased online orders. The previous day, the control board registered almost $30 million in sales, a six-year record. On April 1, due to pent-up, shelter-in-place, we-can't-stay-sober-during-a global-pandemic demand, Wolf opened online sales.

The Lexus NX is only available with a petrol-electric parallel-hybrid powertrain. It consists of a 2.5-litre petrol engine and two electric motors - one on each axle. Combined system power output is rated at 197PS while peak torque is under 300Nm. The NX' powertrain is tuned to be as efficient as possible, with the system deciding which power source can help achieve that. In fact, the SUV will cruise on electric-only mode if you are gentle on the throttle. At higher speeds, however, the petrol engine is almost always on. Lexus claims that the NX can achieve a combined fuel efficiency of 18.3kmpl. In our tests, the NX300h managed 13.12kmpl in the city and 18.42kmpl on the highway. Impressive, to say the least.

There may be legitimate business reasons to trim personnel costs in light of the “dramatic” decline in sales because of the public health crisis, but Willow Run is holding off.
 Wood wants to assure his 430 workers at the 200,000-square-foot warehouse in Kirkwood, Broome County, continue to receive a weekly paycheck and are still on the payroll when, inevitably, business returns to normal.
 He is using reserves built up over the years to cover the expense.
 Willow Run trucks, with their red and blue striping and “success through customer satisfaction” company motto emblazoned on the trailers, are common sights along the major Northeast roadways, delivering supplies to major fast food outlets such as Wendy’s, Arby’s and Popeyes, among others.
 While delivery volumes are trimmed because some of the fast-food outlets Willow Run normally stocks are closed — in airports, malls, and campuses — drive-thru service at free-standing restaurants continues, and those must be supplied through the coronavirus pandemic.
 New York on March 20 shuttered all non-essential businesses, including restaurants and bars except for takeout orders.
 “We don’t want to lay people off,” Wood said, echoing a common theme across the industry.
 Hospitals, nursing homes and military installations still need normal regular deliveries.
 Before the crisis, tractor trailer drivers were in short supply.
 Letting go that critical component of the work force when they could still find similar employment elsewhere would put the industry in a bind when the crisis lapses
 “Laying people off is a last resort,” Allen said. “Drivers are really what makes this industry go.”
 That isn’t the case among their customers.
 The Cheesecake Factory, for instance, furloughed 41,000 hourly employees because of partial closings at restaurants caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
 Filings on the New York Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notifications board are piling up, with restaurants and other food service businesses at the front of the line.
 The National Restaurant Association on Monday estimated New York restaurants have lost $1.9 billion in sales — a 58% decrease compared to this time last year — and have been forced to slash more than 250,000 jobs.
 Wood’s drivers, in the meantime, are doubling up in their truck cabs, teaming up for critical deliveries.
 Where business has dried up, some distributors have pivoted, redirecting some supplies, particularly fresh and dated goods, into a pinched retail supply chain, Allen said.
 Restaurants will open, eventually, but some may not be able to survive through the extended closing.
 “Short-term, this is going to be very painful,” Allen said. “No doubt about it, restaurants will go under.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — While Wisconsin struggles to hold its primary on Tuesday, President Donald Trump and Democrats are bickering over how to provide voters with safe and secure access to a ballot as the coronavirus pandemic rages in the U.S. and threatens to extend into the fall, affecting the general election.With another economic rescue package in the works, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says she wants money to give more voters the chance to cast their ballot by mail, an option that would allow people to vote without the concern over the safety of polling places.But Trump opposes voting by mail and is leading Republicans in a battle to limit its use, arguing that it would encourage fraud and lead to so many people voting that his party could not win.But the 2020 presidential election is creeping ever closer, and there are no signs yet of the pandemic abating, nor any word on when Americans on orders to stay home can resume normal life, so lawmakers are trying to figure out how to allow for voting in a world where face-to-face contact causes anxiety at the least and possibly sickness and death.The debate is playing out now in Wisconsin. It stands apart from other states that have delayed primaries because of the virus, though Democratic Gov. Tony Evers has issued a statewide stay-at-home order.Evers initially joined Republican leaders in seeking to hold the primary as planned on Tuesday, but he now favors an all-mail election with absentee voting well into May. Republicans maintain that Tuesday’s in-person voting should go on as planned.Republicans have said they will ask the U.S. Supreme Court to block extended absentee voting in Tuesday’s primary.The election features the Democratic presidential primary between Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, but a bigger concern for Republicans is a state Supreme Court race that pits a conservative incumbent against a liberal challenger.In recent weeks, as Democrats nationwide have argued the country must prepare for voting largely by mail, Republicans have objected to or blocked expansions of such voting in Arizona, Georgia and Pennsylvania.“It shouldn’t be mail-in voting. It should be you go to a booth and you proudly display yourself,” Trump told reporters Friday evening. Earlier this week on Fox News Channel's “Fox &amp; Friends,” he claimed the Democrats had a plan “that if you ever agreed to it you’d never have a Republican elected in this country again.”More than 290,000 people in the United States have tested positive for the virus so far, prompting more than a dozen states to delay their presidential primaries. Health officials are warning that the virus has the potential to return with a second wave during the next flu season, putting voters and poll workers in a dilemma where fulfilling a civic duty means putting their health at greater risk.Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon and Washington already provide registered voters with a ballot in the mail for all their elections, according to a Congressional Research Service report. California and Utah are among the states that give counties the option of mail-in voting.Proponents say it can improve participation, particularly with voters who have to work on election day, go to school or have mobility issues, such as the elderly or the sick. It could reduce the number of poll workers needed, as well as the long lines that often arise during a presidential election.“It just makes us more democratic,” Pelosi told reporters this week. “It just gives more people the opportunity to vote. So that is something we would like to see.”Trump contends fraud would increase with more mail-in voting, declaring, "I think a lot of people cheat.”A North Carolina congressional election had to be rerun last year because the Republican candidate’s campaign had engaged in widespread fraud through mail ballots.But some Republicans have come to embrace the format, arguing it can be done securely and is cheaper and fairer than in-person elections. Utah, a GOP stronghold, is a recent convert to mail-in voting.Evidence shows it is Republicans, rather than Democrats, who are most likely to vote by mail, said Michael McDonald, a University of Florida professor who tracks balloting.State and local governments are responsible for determining whether or how to offer mail-in voting. A few bills introduced during the current session of Congress would require states to allow for early or mail-in voting for federal elections. Others would require states to allow mail-in voting during national emergencies and authorize the funds to help defray the costs.The $2.2 trillion rescue package that Congress passed included $400 million for states to invest in the next election so they could expand early voting, move to mail-in voting, or increase safety measures at polling sites.That’s a meager investment compared with the $2 billion that the Brennan Center for Justice recently said is needed to ensure the pandemic does not jeopardize a free and fair election.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

Like all those Flyers on the 1971-72 team that missed out on the playoffs with just four seconds left in the final game of the season, bitterness was tempered by the consoling thought they were a team on the rise and soon would come back.
   
 And boy did they ever.
   
 Just a year later, they put a scare into eventual champion Montreal by winning Game 1 of the conference semifinals before bowing out.
   
 The following season the Flyers won the first of their two Stanley Cups.
   
 Nobody is suggesting this year's Flyers team was heading to a championship but, after having seen the season grind to a halt and possibly come to an end, it should be noted many believe this collective group will get several future kicks at the can.
   
 One of those faithful happens to be Bill Clement, who was on that 1971-72 team and now works as a TV analyst for the Flyers on nights when Keith Jones is involved with NBC national broadcasts.
   
 Clement has seen enough of general manager Chuck Fletcher's work to suggest the Flyers are headed for great things ahead, from the signing of head coach Alain Vigneault to players such as Kevin Hayes and Matt Niskanen.
   
 Rising stars such as forward Travis Konecny, defenseman Ivan Provorov and goaltender Carter Hart appear to offer a bright future.
   
 In comparing this current model to those rising teams of the early '70s, Clement begins by saying captain Claude Giroux is starting to look a bit like the Flyers greatest leader of alltime, Bobby Clarke.
   
 "I think Claude Giroux, as he continues to mature and now that he's a dad; what we saw at the end of this season - look, there will never be another Bobby Clarke to me, ever,'' Clement said.
   
 "But Giroux, as a captain, I think at this stage of his career and his life in general, is going to be an impact leader that he perhaps wasn't when he was younger. And nobody was like Bobby Clarke. At age 21, 22, he was General Patton and General Eisenhower rolled into one.
   
 "But I think because Giroux's leadership is in place, and because of the young players in place in goal (Hart) and the blue line (Provorov, Travis Sanheim, Philippe Myers), you have the framework. You can buy goal-scoring in the NHL through free agency but you can't go out and buy goaltending and you can't buy blue chip young defensemen because everyone keeps them.''
   
 The key, in Clement's eye, has been the hiring of Vigneault, a two-time Stanley Cup finalist. Clement already ranks his staff as the Flyers' alltime best and that's saying something, seeing as how staffs led by Fred Shero, Mike Keenan, Pat Quinn, Ken Hitchcock and Peter Laviolette have passed through these doors.
   
 The mix of Vigneault and assistant coaches Michel Therrien and Mike Yeo have not only instituted an efficient system but prepared the players on a daily basis how to execute it.
   
 "This is the best coaching staff the Flyers have ever had,'' Clement said. "That's not going away. The fact that the Flyers' young players still have not reached all of their potential is an incredible positive to look forward to.''
   
 Hart could wind up becoming the kind of Bernie Parent-type goalie the Flyers have been looking for since Ron Hextall retired in the late '90s.
   
 "The cornerstone of the whole thing is the Flyers' goaltending that they've never had,'' Clement said, mindful that it was Parent, not Clarke or Bill Barber or Rick MacLeish who won the Conn Smythe Trophy for playoff MVP both Cup years. "With Hart as the backbone of the crease, it bodes well.
   
 "Tampa Bay should be as frustrated as the Flyers by the stoppage. They have great goaltending but the Flyers are right there with them now and are going to surpass them within a season or two.''
   
 Clement played seven years with the Flames under Fletcher's dad, Hall of Famer Cliff, so he knows first-hand the well of hockey intelligence runs deep.
   
 "Chuck's wisdom is second to none,'' Clement said. "If anyone thinks he just dropped in. ... he's been on a learning curve his whole life, from the time he grew up with his dad.
   
 "I know Chuck to be very analytical and his ability to gather information ... he's an analytics machine. Because his ability to assess what he has, what he needs and how to go about getting it is fantastic.''
   
 Clement, a former Newtown resident now living in Waynesville, N.C., points to the signing of Niskanen and another veteran defenseman Justin Braun as two examples of Fletcher's hockey acumen.
   
 "I had no idea Niskanen was this good,'' Clement said. "He and Provorov are probably one of the six best pairs in the NHL. On both sides of the puck, I would put them up against anybody.''
   
 So fans shouldn't get too worried if the season doesn't come back due to the health crisis. With Giroux, Sean Couturier and Jake Voracek, plus a cast of young stars, this Flyers team should be a legitimate contender for years to come.

Resident Evil 4 Remake Reportedly In The Works, May Release In 2021

St. Joseph's Hospice continues to operate its 10-bed facility in Sarnia during the COVID-19 outbreak without the volunteers and fundraising events it counts on, and in the face of dwindling supplies of personal protective equipment for its staff.
 "We're in a crisis situation, like everybody else," said executive director Larry Lafranier.
 He said a staff member is working full-time to find sources of the needed supplies and the hospice put out a call in the community for donations of N95 masks, surgical gloves and masks, safety glasses, face shields and disposable medical isolation gowns.
 "It's critical that we protect our staff, and our residents," Lafranier said. "If we have to have a more aggressive policy on wearing masks, which may be coming, we could run out in two weeks."
 Staffing is also a challenge with some hospice workers in self-isolation, and the need to re-assign some to tasks that were being done by volunteers before the restrictions.
 In particular, volunteers who helped in the 10-bed residence by working in the kitchen, cleaning, at the reception desk and with other duties are no longer there because of the restrictions.
 Lafranier said volunteers are "the backbone" of hospice and programming staff and others are now being re-assigned to cover many of those duties.
 He has been taking shifts on the reception desk. "It's all hands on deck," he said.
 Keeping the reception desk manned is important because everyone entering the site must be screened, he said.
 Friday, hospice began limiting visitors to just two designated individuals for each resident, and it is telling those visitors to stay away if they're not well.
 "It's very disconcerting to the family members, but this is what we have to do," Lafranier said. "We're doing everything we can to keep our staff safe and still provide the service."
 The hospice has halted its on-site bereavement and supportive-services programs and some staff are working from home.
 Lafranier said they are working to offer bereavement assistance and support by phone and other technology "so was can still touch base with clients, because we don't want to abandon them."
 It's stressful for hospice staff, he said. "They want to do more, but they can't do more because of all the restrictions."
 The outbreak is also financially challenging for hospice since several fundraising events have had to be postponed.
 "That's going to have a major impact on us," Lafranier said. "We're feeling that impact now."
 The hospice needs to raise about $1.6 million each year to pay the 57 per cent of its budget not covered by government funding.
 Donations can be made on its website, stjosephshospice.ca. Anyone wanting to help can also call hospice at 519-337-0537 and leave a message, said Maria Muscedere, manager of fund development.
 Fundraisers originally planned for the spring have been postponed to the fall and hospice is planning to launch a COVID-19 response fund.
 "We just want to make sure we're asking people at the right time, because a lot of people don't know where their jobs lay," she said. "So, we're trying to be very respectful."
 She said they know "our community has a special spot in their heart for hospice" and are grateful for the support it receives.
 Lafranier said hospice hasn't had to lay any of its staff off at this point, and he hopes not to, "but that's a financial reality we'll have to look at, down the road."
 Muscedere joined Lafranier in praising the hospice staff, particularly its frontline workers, who "come in here with a smile every day and try to do the best they can."
 She added, "We hope we can all work through this and have a safe and healthy community at the end."

If you are looking for a cake that you can eat for breakfast, with tea, as a snack or dessert, this is the cake for you. And it also happens to be gluten- free. This lemon polenta cake is moist with olive oil and drenched in lemony syrup. The result is a moist and dense cake, bursting with citrus and with a nutty, toothsome texture, thanks to the polenta and almond meal. It's also not an overly sweet cake, which may lead you to munch on it all day long. For the record, no one will judge you for that.
 The only tricky issue is that this cake actually tastes better the day after baking, once the flavor and texture have been allowed to develop. So the challenge, if you can bear it, is to wrap the cake tightly in plastic and let it stand at room temperature overnight (perhaps out of sight). Of course, it's highly acceptable to have a nibble or two when it's right out of the oven. After all, you're the chef, and it's always good practice to taste and inspect your results.
 This cake keeps well and can last up to four days at room temperature, which really is moot, because it's also positively addicting, so chances are, once you begin eating it, you won't be able to stop.

Pollux and Castor are two fairly bright stars not far apart on the face of the night sky, prominent on April evenings. These two are considered the "heads" in the constellation, Gemini the Twins.      They're not exactly identical twins.      Despite the bright moonlight this week, they stand out, high in the southern sky between 8 and 9 p.m. (daylight savings time) They are visible most of the night, setting in the northwest a little after 3 a.m.      Orion, the majestic constellation with its famed trio of stars marking Orion's Belt, can be used to point right at Pollux and Castor. Orion is a bit lower, in the south-southwest around 8-9 p.m. Trace an imagined line from Orion's bright blue-white star Rigel at lower right of the "Belt," through the bright red star Betelgeuse at upper left of the "Belt." Continue this line to the upper left, to the Castor and Pollux duo.      (Betelgeuse, by the way, has triumphantly regained its brightness after a few months of unusual dimness this winter.)      Pollux is the brightest of the two "heads" of the Twins, and the lower one (assuming you aren't in the Southern Hemisphere where the perspective is turned on its head). The star's color is light yellow-orange. In 2006, a planet about 2.3 times the mass of Jupiter, was discovered circling the star. The International Astronomical Union has named this planet Thestias.      Castor is bluish-white and bright, but less so than Pollux. Castor's claim to fame for amateur astronomers training their backyard telescopes at the sky is that there are actually six stars in the Castor system. We see it as one, with unaided eyes. There are three pairs of binary (double) stars, orbiting around a common center of mass.      Telescopes, however, only pick up three of these stars. Two are easily seen in a small telescope; you may also find a third star, which is a lot fainter. Each of them are double stars themselves, but they are so close it takes a spectroscope, splitting the starlight into their spectrum of colors, to resolve them as double stars. They don't know anything about social distancing, a serious matter here on planet Earth lately.      The rest of the naked-eye stars making up the pattern of Gemini the Twins stretch back to the west (or right as seen on an April evening), towards Orion. There is a beautiful star cluster known as M35 located near the stars marking one of the "feet" of the Twins. M35 is easily visible in binoculars when the moon isn't around, and is a fine sight in a small telescope.      It's interesting to note that Pollux is 34 light-years from the Earth, and Castor is 51 light-years away. That means the two "heads" of Gemini the Twins are 17 light-years apart. It takes that many years for the starlight from one to reach the other. That would seem to make the Twins an incredibly immense couple of brothers.      Of course, we know that the constellations are imagined, two-dimensional patterns of our making. The stars across the sky are in three dimensions, at greatly varying distances. A space traveler heading out among the stars would observe that the constellation patterns as we know them become unrecognizable the farther we travel from the sun.      That doesn't stop us from enjoying them!      Full moon is on Tuesday, April 7. The moon will be close to its monthly perigee, when it is closest to Earth. This will make the moon appear a little larger (by 14%) and brighter (by 30%) than when the full phase happens to occur close to the moon's farthest point, apogee.      Be sure to see the trio of planets in the southeast in the hour before dawn. From left are Mars, (which is reddish), Saturn and Jupiter (which appears as the brightest). Venus is extremely bright in the evening, in the western sky.   Keep looking up at the sky!      Peter Becker is managing editor at The News Eagle in Hawley, Pennsylvania.

The Sarnia Sting chose centre Maxim Namestnikov of the Detroit HoneyBaked 15s with the third overall pick in the Ontario Hockey League draft Saturday.
 The five-foot-seven, 165-pound Namestnikov had 128 points in 59 games this past season.
 He scored 53 goals and set up another 75.
 "Max may be the most offensively gifted and creative player in this year's priority selection," OHL Central Scouting said on the OHL website. "He is explosive off the mark and has another gear that a lot of players don't have. He isn't the biggest player, but he doesn't let that stop him, as he will battle anyone for a loose puck.
 "His offensive tools and instincts are what really separate him from everyone else; he can make moves in tight areas and isn't afraid of traffic either. He played a big role in his team's success as a driving force in every game they played."
 The native of Wolverine Lake, Mich., is the younger brother of former London Knights forward Vladislav Namestnikov, who's now with the Colorado Avalanche.
 His uncle Ivan Novoseltsev spent two seasons with the Sting from 1997-99 before playing parts of five seasons in the NHL, most with the Florida Panthers.
 His father, Evgeny Namestnikov, and uncle Slava Kozlov also played in the NHL.
 The North Bay Battalion chose Toronto Jr. Canadiens defenceman Ty Nelson with the No. 1 pick and the Niagara IceDogs selected Jr. Canadiens forward Pano Fimis at No. 2.
 The consensus top prospect, forward Adam Fantilli, went 18th overall to the Saginaw Spirit after committing to the USHL's Chicago Steel.
 The Sting used their second-round pick, 34th overall, on Toronto Minor Midget AAA Titans defenceman Matthew Morden.
 The six-foot-two, 166-pound Burlington native had five goals and 14 assists in 32 regular-season games.
 The Sting chose right-winger Ryder McIntyre of the Ajax-Pickering Minor Midget 'AAA' Raiders in the third round, 51st overall.
 The six-foot-two, 207-pound Stouffville native had 24 goals and 17 assists in 36 regular-season games.
 More to come.

Panaji (Goa) [India], April 5 (ANI): As travel has been restricted to prevent coronavirus spread, a relief flight with 150 Spanish and other European passengers will take off from Goa airport to Madrid on Saturday night.   "A relief flight carrying 150 Spanish and EU nationals will take off from Goa International Airport to Madrid tonight," Goa Airport Director Gagan Malik told ANI.   He said that thermal screening of passengers at entry and social distancing will be maintained during check-in at the airport.   "Arrangments have been made for passengers to wait with seats, water and fans before entry to a terminal for check-in as they arrive very early due to obvious reasons," Malik added.   The Indian government curtailed all international flights and later extended that suspension on domestic flights as well to combat the spread of coronavirus. (ANI)
