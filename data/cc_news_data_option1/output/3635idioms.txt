Virtually every one of you spoke of your willingness to kill or die to protect Little Lizzie — any “Little Lizzie.” Second, so many of you were confused or surprised with the depth of your own reactions, saying you had never really examined — not deep in your guts — this very primal and central dynamic, which drives all of your more intellectual and super-conscious reasons for being armed, for asserting your right to self-defense, and to intervene to protect the lives of others. Third, those of you who have not been tested under fire wondered — _How would I do? Could I cut it?_ — if you had to stand and deliver, atgrave risk, as a human barrier between “the bad men” and a Little Lizzie. Folks, we need to talk.

Washington's Patrick Corbin will have plenty of motivation on Saturday when he takes the mound against the visiting Atlanta Braves.
 Not only is the left-hander looking for revenge from his last poor start against the Braves but he's trying to improve upon his sterling record at Nationals Park.
 Corbin (2-4, 4.34 ERA) will get the start in the third game of the four-game series between the NL East rivals. He will be opposed by Atlanta rookie Ian Anderson (2-0, 2.40), who has emerged as the team's second-most reliable starting pitcher.
 Since joining the Nationals in 2019, Corbin is 9-3 with a 2.57 ERA in games played in Washington. He was beaten the last time out by the Braves in Atlanta, when he was roughed up for five runs in 5 1/3 innings. It was only the second time in eight starts that Corbin has allowed as many as five runs.
 "They had a good game plan," Corbin said. "I thought I made some good pitches and gave up some hits on that as well. I thought my stuff was better."
 Anderson will be making his fourth major league start. It will be his first appearance against the Nationals. His last outing came on Sept. 7 against Miami and, hurt by a high pitch count, he was only able to work three innings. He had given the Braves six innings in his first two starts against the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox.
 Perhaps Corbin can pitch deep enough in the game to take the pressure off the Washington bullpen. The team's relievers have stumbled in the first two games of the series and allowed the Braves to overcome a five-run deficit each night. The Braves won the first game with a dramatic comeback, but the Nationals prevailed in 12 innings on Friday.
 "Those (relievers) are our horses," Washington manager Dave Martinez said. "They've been throwing the ball really well. We'll go back (Saturday), hopefully get the lead again in the seventh and you'll see those guys out there again."
 For all the dramatic comebacks, the Braves have been leaving plenty of runners on base. On Friday they stranded 22 runners and left the bases loaded in the 11th and 12th innings. Atlanta batters were 6-for-22 with runners in scoring position.
 "I don't know how to explain it," Atlanta manager Brian Snitker said. "It isn't because guys aren't trying. They want to drive that run in more than anybody wants them to, believe me. It's just one of those things. ... We came back from five down again and scored seven runs. It should be enough to win."
 It is uncertain whether Atlanta outfielder Ronald Acuna Jr. will be able to play this weekend. He fouled a pitch off his left foot and had to leave the game. Acuna asked the trainer to come out and didn't appear able to put any weight on the foot as he was helped off the field. But X-rays were taken and came back negative. Acuna is listed as day-to-day.
 The Braves (26-19) hold a 2 1/2 game lead over Philadelphia, which split a doubleheader with Miami on Friday. The Nationals (17-26) have split eight games with the Braves this season.

BOISE — Gov. Brad Little on Friday restored $99 million in K-12 education funding he cut earlier this year amid budget shortfall concerns because of the coronavirus pandemic.
 The Republican governor also announced that another $50 million will be made available to parents so they’re less likely to leave the workforce or dip into household money while their children learn during the challenges posed by the pandemic.
 “The stresses on our kids, families and educators right now our enormous,” Little said.
 The money is coming from Idaho’s $1.25 billion share of the $2.2 trillion emergency relief package approved by Congress and signed by President Donald Trump last spring. Little said the U.S. Treasury Department last week changed rules on how the money can be spent, allowing the additional education spending. The money is on top of $122 million already provided to K-12 education from the relief money.
 The $99 million cut earlier this year has already been absorbed by the state’s school districts, and school officials said it will be up to the local districts on how to spend the replacement money coming in.
 “This money will support the schools throughout the state,” said Superintendent of Public Instruction Sherri Ybarra. “We hear every day about the new challenges that districts face on the fly.”
 The $50 million for the Strong Families, Strong Students initiative program will provide up to $1,500 per child with a maximum of $3,500 per family. The money can be used to purchase educational materials, devices and services.
 Many students are learning at home as school districts try to avoid spreading the virus.
 Idaho has about 300,000 children in grades K-12, and the $50 million will help just over 30,000 of them, or around 15,000 families. Families can start applying for the program in October.
 State Board of Education President Debbie Critchfield said the money will be distributed on a needs basis related to income. “We wish there was more, but we believe this is a substantial start,” she said.
 She said the money could in particular help relieve stress students and teachers face on getting and using the technology needed for students to learn online.
 There was some confusion about whether any of the $99 million could be used for teacher pay, as it’s supposed to be used only for needs related to the coronavirus. Little said the program was so new that details still had to be worked out.
 Earlier this week, budget officials said tax revenues came in $37 million, or 13 percent, over forecasts for August, and the state was looking at a potential $500 million in surplus tax revenue for the fiscal year that started in July. Nearly $100 million of that was the cut to education.
 Little said earlier this week it might be possible to focus on some of his education priorities, namely literacy and teacher pay, during the legislative session that starts in January.
 “If I can maintain healthcare capacity, get people back to work and get kids back to school, a lot of these problems will be a lot less,” Little said at the Friday news conference.
 Johns Hopkins University says Idaho has nearly 35,000 infections and just over 400 deaths through Thursday. But the percent of people testing positive for the virus has been trending down, recently dropping below 8 percent. The state’s economy also has been rebounding with unemployment dropping to 5%, though officials say federal emergency relief money could be only temporarily lowering that number.
 Of the state’s $1.25 billion in relief money, about $200 million remains.
 For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. But for some it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death.

When Leeds United and Liverpool met in the Charity Shield in the curtain raiser for the inaugural Premier League season in 1992, Leeds were the reigning First Division champions and Liverpool, winners two years prior, were the FA Cup holders. Leeds arrived at Wembley boasting a formidable squad including the likes of Gary McAllister, John Lukic, Gordon Strachan, Gary Speed, Lee Chapman and Eric Cantona. The enigmatic Frenchman (pictured here) would guide Leeds to a 4-3 victory with a hat-trick, and weeks later would become the first player to score three in a single Premier League match. However, Leeds would ultimately lose Cantona to Manchester United in November that season – an irreconcilable loss – and limp to a 17th-place finish, only narrowly avoiding the drop; meanwhile, Liverpool would finish sixth and endure a further 27 years of domestic heartbreak before landing the big one last term. Now, these two rejuvenated titans will face one another in the league for the first time in 16 years, as the 2020/21 Premier League season gets underway.

Portuguese men o' war continue to be spotted in Rhode Island waters, with some found washed up on beaches, according to the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management.
 But the state DEM hasn't received any additional reports of people being stung since Scarborough State Beach was closed late Monday after two people were stung, apparently by men o' war.
 The state began flying purple flags to warn beach-goers after the Scarborough incidents. The creatures, which pack a mean sting, have also been spotted off Cape Cod, Martha's Vineyard, Nantucket and Horseneck Beach in Westport.
 The DEM said it would keep an eye out for the men o' war this week, and there have been several additional sightings, according to spokeswoman Gail Mastrati.
 Some of the creatures were found dead, washed up on beaches, but the siphonophores (a group of animals closely related to jellyfish), with tentacles that can grow up to 100 feet long, can pack a punch, even in death.
 "People should avoid handling (Portuguese men o' war) or accidentally stepping on them because their tentacles can still sting even if the animal is dead," Mastrati said.
 On Wednesday, DEM Marine Fisheries staff observed three men o' war in the Sakonnet River and on Thursday saw five that had washed up and were dead on Scarborough State Beach, according to Mastrati.
 DEM Marine Fisheries staff also received a confirmed report from a person who observed three at Fort Wetherill in Jamestown on Thursday, also washed up and dead, she said.
 In another report from the public, an individual reported seeing three men o' war in the Sakonnet River just south of Black Point in Portsmouth on Tuesday, but she said the report was not confirmed by the DEM as no photos were provided.
 On Friday morning, the DEM received a call from someone who reported seeing several dead men o' war washed up on the private, ocean-facing beach off Jerusalem, according to Mastrati.
 John Costello, a professor of marine biology at Providence College, captured one off Fort Wetherill on Wednesday, brought it back to campus and put it in a tank to show his students. It might have been the first chance those students had to see one up close.
 "It's a beautiful animal," Costello said, noting the variety of colors, "the blues and pinks."
 Men o' war don't swim. They are transported by wind and currents. Costello agrees with Jason McNamee, a marine biologist and deputy director for natural resources at the DEM, who believes a "warm core ring has peeled off from the Gulf Stream" toward the Rhode Island coast, sending the men o' war into Southern New England waters.
 Costello doesn't expect the man o' war to survive in the tank for more than a few days. (It already got caught in the filter on its first night.) The DEM doesn't expect them to survive in Southern New England waters for much longer either, according to Mastrati.
 "We cannot say exactly when we will stop seeing" them, Mastrati said, but "given that they are more of a tropical/subtropical species, they will likely not survive as water temperatures drop as we move into the fall."

For 32 years, I've been reporting on moving pictures. It's been a blast. But the advent of COVID-19 has taken a lot of the fun out of it. It's also left me more time to idle around the house, shut in because I carry the high-risk factors of age and chronic disease -- cancer, four bouts. My wife, Kate, also working from home, has many a time wished for me to find something to do other than pester her. "If you want to be productive, why don't you scan all our old photos and sort them into folders. Anything that will keep you out of my hair!"
 In the interest of self-preservation, I heeded her command, emptying the closets and depositing dozens of photo packets beside my PC. What followed was the epitome of rote. Grab two or three snaps, scan 'em, edit 'em and save. During the process, I started thinking of Paul Anka's "Times of Your Life." Then, at a certain point, the guy who writes about moving pictures was moved by the pictures of his life. Memories came rushing back, catching me unaware. Some elicited smiles, laughter. Others -- pictures of my deceased mom and dad; my high-school sweetheart, Sue; long-lost friends; and most especially Kate and me -- unleashed the waterworks.
 Where had all the time gone? And why does it seem I relish those seminal moments more now than when they occurred? Is it merely age and experience? Who knows? All I was certain of was how I wished I could relive every second the camera captured. It was impactful, existential even.
 It began with a picture of me surrounded by all of my closest friends from Omaha, shot in the middle of the driveway of my BFF, Bill, during a break between pickup basketball games. I thought about the divergent paths each of us would take over the ensuing 45 years. Life's usual trajectories: careers; marriage; divorce; kids; and, yes, misfortunes. Next was a group photo of my colleagues and me at our student newspaper, The Gateway. It amazed me how successful each of us had become. We literally covered the world. Some had penned books, others winning rewards for what they've written or photographed. Suddenly, I realized how lucky I'd been to know them all.
 I wanted to share the experience. I sent a few of the pictures to my childhood pal Ed in Colorado. Then, out of the blue, a Facebook message from Bill's wife, Cheree, in San Francisco. She loved the "driveway" photo I had posted and sent me her email address. This was major. Not just because I was back in touch with an old friend, but because I was finally able to express my hopes and prayers to Bill in the midst of his long, difficult recovery from a fall that left him paralyzed. The next day, Cheree's sister Michele in Chicago contacted me. She too loved the old photo of "our gang." Soon, she and I were catching up. Bliss.
 This was so great and cathartic, why not expand the circle? Kate looked to see if she could find an email address for my old girlfriend Kathy, whose photos I had kept. Simple enough, but why was Kate crying?
 "She's died," is all she could muster through her tears. "Who?" I asked, never imagining she could be referring to my Kathy. But, sadly, she was gone. I started shaking, tears streamed; memories of our years living together in Boston and Brookline came flooding back. I was stunned. Time truly waits for no one. I went on Facebook in an attempt to find her brother to offer my belated condolences. No luck.
 During the search, though, memories of my ex-fiancee Sue began to surface. I had lots of photos of her, too, that I knew she'd like to have. I looked her up on Facebook in hopes of sending them, as I'd planned to do with Kathy. Thank God, Sue was very much alive. I never liked the way things ended with us more than 45 years ago.
 So do I dare send a "friend" request her way? Would she reject me and make me feel even worse? Happy to say, no. Turns out she was thinking of me too. We exchanged emails before hanging a sharp right onto Memory Lane. The laughter surged; so did the tears and "what ifs." It was more transcendent than I ever expected. It had been 42 years since we last talked, but within seconds it felt as if we'd never been apart.
 Yet, it was the many pictures of my beautiful wife impacting me the most. What was it about seeing her in her youth again that evoked such adoration? Is it possible I was falling in love with her all over again? Yes, it was. And it couldn't be more well-timed, as I stare death in the face. As is the case with my friends and lovers, I have lots of pictures of my cancer, be it in my colon, liver, or lung. They're as much a part of my life as all those other photos. But excuse me if I don't place them among my keepsakes. And don't let the Big C know I'm having the last laugh, basking in the joy of renewed friendships and a profound new perspective on life. All of it because of a few hundred photographs. They are echoes of my past and a map to my future. Perhaps there's a similar encounter awaiting you in your closets. Take my advice and open up to see what develops. It just may well change your life for the better.

MIAMI (AP) — Tropical Depression Nineteen was just off the coast of South Florida early Saturday but is expected to move into the Gulf of Mexico and strengthen into a tropical storm, while Tropical Storm Paulette was expected to intensify into a hurricane. The depression was located 35 miles (55 kilometers) west-southwest of Miami, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said in its 5 a.m. advisory.

Don was my brother, although we grew up in different households. I first met Don at Christmas break from college in 1947 ; he was 10, I was 17. For most of our years we followed different paths and did not meet again until I visited him, Connie and the boys in 2005. That was a good reunion, spending time sharing memories and 'just hanging out.' I visited again for a few days each in 2006, 2007, and 2008 as I flew back east from my home in Oregon. We remained close for several years and communicated by phone or mail until his last two or three years when we gradually ceased contact for reasons I'm not clear about, but my love for Don was fast.      I loved Don and Connie very much, and know they loved me. I knew his illness was working hard against him for a fully comfortable retirement, but he stayed upbeat as much as possible. Don was a proud dad, and played guitar with Clint and Tate out of desire to be closer to each other.      I wish for Connie, Clint and Tate comfort and guidance as they continue to 'hold the fort,' continuing on each of their paths into the future.

“To the leaders of Iran, I would greatly appreciate if you would spare this young man’s life, and not execute him,” Trump wrote last week. “Thank you!”
 Iran responded to Trump’s tweet with a nearly 11-minute state TV package on Afkari. It included the weeping parents of the slain water company employee, Hassan Torkaman. The package included footage of Afkari on the back of a motorbike, saying he had stabbed Torkaman in the back, without explaining why he allegedly carried out the assault.
 The state TV segment showed blurred police documents and described the killing as a “personal dispute,” without elaborating. It said Afkari’s cellphone had been in the area and it showed surveillance footage of him walking down a street, talking on his phone.
 Also, Iran’s semiofficial Tasnim news agency dismissed Trump’s tweet in a feature story, saying that American sanctions have hurt Iranian hospitals amid the pandemic.
 “Trump is worried about the life of a murderer while he puts many Iranian patients’ lives in danger by imposing severe sanctions,” the agency said.

These “practical considerations” have given birth to something utterly otherworldly. One hint to the themes lies in the title: Clarke has always been fascinated by the 18th-century Italian artist Giovanni Battista Piranesi and his atmospheric etchings of fictional prisons, shadowy vaults with enormous staircases and impossible geometries. “Some ideas go into your mind and become part of the furniture,” she says. “I also remember reading in Alan Moore’s Promethea comics that ‘We’ve all had this dream of wandering in a great house’, and I thought yes, I do have that dream quite often! I was trying to conjure up an environment that is quite startling, but at the same time you think, ‘I’ve almost been here before.’” Other antecedents include Narnia, referenced throughout – Piranesi’s favourite statue is of a faun in the pose of Mr Tumnus – and the short stories of Jorge Luis Borges, particularly his retelling of the minotaur myth in “The House of Asterion”. “There’s so much of Piranesi in that story that I must have subconsciously remembered … CS Lewis and Borges, not an obvious combination!”

Siracusa - Cinque persone di una banda che da due anni agiva indisturbata nella zona nord della provincia di Siracusa, compiendo furti e rapine, sono state sottoposte alla misura cautelare dell'obbligo di dimora nell'ambito di un'indagine compiuta da polizia e carabinieri. La banda avrebbe agito tra i comuni di Buccheri, Ferla, Lentini ed Augusta. I carabinieri hanno raccolto sei denunce per altrettanti furti nelle abitazioni durante la scorsa estate a Buccheri. Le indagini del commissariato di Augusta sono scattate dopo una rapina del settembre 2019 a un supermercato: due persone entrarono armate di pistola, colpendo uno dei due dipendenti alla testa con il calcio dell'arma, mentre un cliente venne scaraventato a terra.La visione dei filmati di videosorveglianza pubblici e privati ha permesso ai carabinieri di rintracciare i componenti della banda e di recuperare anche parte della refurtiva nelle abitazioni in un 'compro oro' di Lentini e nel vano sottoscala di uno degli autori dei furti.

The Kansas City Royals invested heavily in young arms in the 2018 draft, taking four college pitchers in the first 40 picks. They added the consensus best college pitcher available in the 2020 draft, taking Asa Lacy from Texas A&M with the fourth overall selection.
 But when the Royals send Carlos Hernandez to the mound against the Pittsburgh Pirates Saturday for his first major league start, they'll be going outside their prized quintet.
 The Royals will be going for their fifth straight win Saturday, as they defeated the Pirates 4-3 behind rookie Kris Bubic's first career major league win Friday night. That followed rookie Brady Singer taking a no-hitter into the eighth inning Thursday night in Cleveland.
 Hernandez (0-0, 1.42 ERA) has pitched 6 1/3 innings out of the bullpen since making his debut Sept. 1. He came in in relief of Matt Harvey both times. He says he's ready.
 "I'm really happy, but I kind of expected it at some point," he said through an interpreter Friday. "I'm looking forward to it. It's the fruit of my labor. I feel like my work is paying off."
 The Pirates will give Trevor Williams (1-6, 5.80 ERA) another chance in Saturday's contest. He had an up and down start his last time out, throwing 111 pitches in six innings. He struck out six batters and allowed only five hits, but three of those hits left the yard. He's allowed 10 homers in 40 1/3 innings this season.
 "He's showed us the ability to use his breaking ball," Pirates manager Derek Shelton said. "That's something we've talked about numerous times. The starts that he's had that have been productive is when he's been able to use his breaking ball. The outings that have been shorter have been when he's not been able to execute the breaking ball."
 The struggles have not caused Williams, who has never faced the Royals, to lose his confidence.
 "Your numbers are going to be your numbers," Williams said after his last start. "If it looks bad, so be it. I know that I'm a good pitcher. I know that, at the end of the day, I'm executing most of my pitches. And there are some things that I do need to work on, there's no doubt about that. However, I'm taking as much positive as I can."
 Hernandez joins Singer and Bubic among starting pitchers who have made their debuts for Kansas City this season. With Jackson Kowar and Daniel Lynch -- the other two 2018 draftees -- and Lacy at the Royals' alternate site, Hernandez has a chance to show that he belongs as part of the Royals future.
 Hernandez was not part of the club's original 60-man roster when the regular season resumed. He kept in shape in the club's Arizona spring training facility and spent a short amount of time at the alternate site.
 But manager Mike Matheny said he earned his call up, and he now has a chance to be part of the conversation of the Royals youthful pitching future.
 "He's right in that age group of young, exciting pitchers," he said. "He's one of those great stories of a guy who gets the opportunity and he jumps all over it. Those are the ones you love telling guys all through your system."

The national media have become the ultimate Monday morning quarterbacks. Most football fans know the phrase that’s used to describe the “experts” sitting in their chairs, drinking beer and eating nachos as they rip coaches and players for every play that goes wrong, adding commentary on what they would have done instead. It is easy — and inconsequential — to be a Monday morning quarterback. Nothing like actually being a quarterback or coach.
 The furor du jour emanating from a large swath of the national media — stoked with willing accomplices known as politicians — is about a few sentences Donald Trump uttered in February about him knowing the COVID-19 virus was deadly and then “downplaying it.” Many have accused him of outright murder!
 So let’s get in our time machine and go back to Feb. 7. According to the Centers for Disease Control, the first American was still three weeks away from dying from the disease. Mardi Gras parades were hopping in South Louisiana. The Chiefs were fresh off a Super Bowl victory. High school basketball season was in full swing. Congress was busy impeaching a president over a phone call. So what would have happened in that climate had the president come out and declared that a virus that few had heard about was going to cause 190,000 American deaths?
 We have been told since long before he was even elected that he was a habitual liar. So why would have Americans, especially those who disagree with him vehemently, suddenly believe him about a virtually unknown virus? Are you serious? We could write the CNN chryon for the network: TRUMP FOMENTS FEAR WITH IRRATIONAL WARNINGS ON UNKNOWN VIRUS ... TRUMP, WITHOUT EVIDENCE, SAYS VIRUS WILL BE WORSE THAN THE SPANISH FLU ... TRUMP TOUTS KILLER VIRUS TO TAKE ATTENTION AWAY FROM IMPEACHMENT, FAILED PRESIDENCY ...
 So, please, spare us your Monday morning quarterback moral outrage. We are not buying it.
 The national media and its left-leaning political allies have become the most dishonest, disingenuous, politically motivated, disgraceful group of hacks in the history of journalism (and we use that word loosely to describe these people). The “revelations” in Bob Woodward’s book of a sentence said seven months ago is just the latest “bombshell” that will fizzle out. The national media is playing Americans for fools because of a disdain for this country’s “coach.”
 And that, friends, is the real news.

Iran responded to Trump's tweet with a nearly 11-minute state TV package on Afkari. It included the weeping parents of the slain water company employee, Hassan Torkaman. The package included footage of Afkari on the back of a motorbike, saying he had stabbed Torkaman in the back, without explaining why he allegedly carried out the assault.

Republican John Anderson of Illinois took a different approach. He wasn’t so much an orator as a debater, a politician of high intelligence who enjoyed the intellectual challenge of politics. As a result, he was a superb debater, with a great fondness for the verbal give and take as he faced off against an ideological opponent. He mastered every subject he took on and defended his positions with wit and verve.
 So did John McCormack from Massachusetts, who was House Speaker during the 1960s. Very quick on the draw, he would turn to his adversary in debate and say something like, “I hold the gentleman in minimum high regard,” to the amusement of everyone around. He, too, loved being in the fray: he would readily relinquish the Speaker’s chair so he could go down to the floor and throw himself into verbal combat.
 Edith Green, from Oregon, had been a schoolteacher and then a lobbyist for the state education association before coming to Congress, and she carried those skills with her to the House. In a sense, she made the House her classroom, and when she had the mic, she was engaging but firm as she battled to advance women’s issues and social reform.
 Mo Udall of Arizona always spoke with humor and tried to make his listeners see the lighter side of things. He believed you should have a good time while you participated in serious subjects; he had a memorable ability to come up with just the right anecdote to illustrate the points he wanted to make. He made you want to listen because it was so enjoyable to do so.
 Despite their different approaches, these people — and other great speakers — were articulate, spoke fluidly and clearly, and showed great confidence and ease. They obviously enjoyed it. They were people who strove to make themselves understood, without showing the effort involved.
 So, while oratory may come in different packages, the chance to watch great communicators at work gives you a better sense of who they are, why they have succeeded, and why our multi-faceted political system is so interesting, engaging and important.

If you own a home and your housing costs exceed 30% of your income, now may actually be a good time to downsize. Right now, it's a seller's market due to extremely low inventory, so a buyer may be willing to pay top dollar for your home. And if you get enough money from the sale of your home to pay off your mortgage, you can then apply for a new one that's more manageable. You could also rent for a while until you're in a better position to buy.

If life gives lemons, make lemonade. How often have I made that statement? Sometimes it’s through tears that I set my face towards the sun once more and keep on going. Other times there’s just spilled milk, a lack of sleep, or sick little ones that remind me that life isn’t about choosing what I want. Why, if life would be solely dependent on circumstances, it wouldn’t be worth the ride. Certainly, if it wasn’t for the Mender we would all be torn apart. I cherish the song, “You can fly with mended wings.” We all have mended wings, right? If we’d never heal from our difficulties and disappointments, we’d never get anywhere in life.
 Perhaps where I tend to get tested the most is holding my newborn, knowing that life will one day bring rough times and harsh disappointments in one way or another. Yes, I’m Mama, yet there is not a thing I can do to make life easy as pie for our little ones. My mind flips to my own dear mother. As much as she would’ve loved to fix all my troubles as a young girl when I was struggling with my health or the times I watched my beloved stillborn sisters being lowered into a grave, there was no way she could just make everything OK.
 How I thank God for those times now. Yes, I’m so glad there was no way she could make my life smooth sailing. Why if she could have, my faith wouldn’t have been strengthened in the only One who is now able to take me through the trying times we face in an adult world loaded with responsibilities amid all the turbulence in the world.

 She was diagnosed with stage 4 lymphoma in 1978 and began chemotherapy treatments. She got a hold of The Word of God and began to believe Him for her total healing and complete wholeness and decided that she wasn’t going to continue with the chemotherapy treatments any longer. God miraculously healed her and made her whole with no sign of the cancer to ever return. She shared her testimony of God’s healing to anyone who would listen and witnessed to countless others by blessing them with a daily devotional book called “From Faith To Faith.” Her reward in Heaven is sure to be great because she was truly a covenant woman.
