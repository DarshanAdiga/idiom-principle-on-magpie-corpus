“Law enforcement is a little hesitant to enforce the mandate,” Cooper said.
 Asked if systemic racism exists, Cooper praised peaceful protests, condemned violence but did not offer a direct response to the question of whether he believes in systemic racism. Hours before Wednesday’s debate, the North Carolina Republican Party shed light on another issue where Cooper hasn’t been fully transparent. The party filed a lawsuit to compel Cooper to disclose more information about his public schedule.
 Forest gave a direct answer to the question about racism.
 “No, I don’t think there’s systemic racism,” he said. “There is racism. We should reject it at every single turn.”
 Forest cited widespread support he’s received from law enforcement groups and routinely attacked Cooper’s slow reopening. He said South Carolina has succeeded in keeping case counts steady while simultaneously reopening more parts of the economy. He also praised Tennessee and Georgia for easing restrictions while promoting safety.
 “They’re learning how to live with the virus and protect the vulnerable and get people back to work,” Forest said. “They’re learning how to do that. We have to learn how to do that in North Carolina, too.”
 Cooper chastised the comparison to Georgia, noting its similar population size but 100,000 more COVID cases and nearly twice the number of deaths. He said, “That’s the kind of state you’d get with Dan Forest as governor: More cases, more deaths, more deaths in nursing homes. I don’t think the people of North Carolina want that, Dan.”
 Forest also attacked Cooper for not giving all K-12 public school parents the option to put their kids back in classrooms.
 “Special needs kids need teachers in classrooms,” Forest said. “All kids need teachers in the classroom. That’s the way it’s supposed to be. We’ve got to get back to that.”
 Cooper’s latest reopening guidance lets local school districts decide whether to return to daily, in-person learning for elementary school students. Middle and high school students in public schools must still remain virtual at least part of the time and do not have the option to offer daily instruction in physical classrooms. Many elementary schools still offer only partial or fully remote learning.
 Forest would reopen all public schools without a statewide mandate for masks or 6 feet (1.8 meters) of physical distancing. Instead, districts would be able to set their own health protocols and continue to offer remote learning options to parents who want it.
