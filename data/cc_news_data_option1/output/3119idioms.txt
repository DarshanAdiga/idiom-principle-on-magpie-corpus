Yes, that's always been an issue that we've had to consider. Largely, there aren't that many contract manufacturers or other outsourcing sources for some of the products that are absolutely critical to those that we make. And so it's a requisite aspect of our systems that we have to make or pay an arm and a leg for somebody else to build those. It makes a lot more sense for us to instead look for more of the vertical integration with respect to those operations. But by the same token and what our strategy has always been, is to provide other opportunities through that vertical integration of other markets and other things that can be made. To that end, it's why we continue to try to grow our own contract manufacturing capabilities and expertise. And that's a part of what our adjacent markets revenue represents. So point of fact is we build other components in other markets for them in those same areas of our manufacturing facilities, where we built some of our very critical but not available elsewhere components.

It's definitely opened up our aperture. Before we had we're very focused on what we pursued and why we pursued it and the risk associated with that could be significant because we had to make the right choices with the bandwidth that we have. But now selectively, what this will be a slight oversimplification, but it's still reasonably accurate. Geospace is more than three decades of hardware, what I call a data acquisition system, hardware superiority and all of the knowledge and infrastructure it takes to make data acquisition systems for the austere environment has been a significant add to Quantum. Their strategy in the active source oil and gas market was to provide the best data possible so that their service providers and oil companies could apply whatever techniques they chose to for what's called reflection seismology, imaging the upper layers of the earth's crust. We don't do that. Our analytics are based more on identifying the source. So we bring to the fight then very solid data acquisition. Once you've acquired the data, the data analysis component. So we understand how to bring in real-time, thousands of channels and then operate on those channels in real-time and produce information. So no operator in the loop. And that's a very, very complex thing to do.

CLAY CENTER, Kansas –Often I engage with people in conversations about God and the Bible. Many times I do not know where they stand with God until we begin talking. More often than not, I hear “I believe in God”, “I pray”, “I’ve asked for forgiveness”, “I’ve been baptized”, or even “Jesus is my Savior and Lord.” Yet, in the midst of these religious professions I have noticed a glaring problem. There is a wide chasm between their profession and daily lifestyle. The two do not line up. When I observe this and ask a question like, “It’s wonderful you state that Jesus is your Savior and Lord. Do you obey Him?” Then I hear the sound of crickets. Somehow, someway, they have been exposed to a teaching that tells them obedience to God does not matter. They have been taught that if they get all the right religious professions down and throw in a few important religious duties along with that, then God’s grace will cover them and their home in heaven is certain. Is this true?

Well, Bill, I think that, that would end up being a little bit further down the road. So that revenue might start be recognized being recognized in fiscal year 2021. But the installations are not going to be until after our fiscal year 2021, at least under the current discussions as they are now. So with the way the revenue recognition rules run these days, they change on a daily basis. But I think that would likely there would be some, obviously, that occur as that contract would develop. But I think a good portion and perhaps the majority would come later.

To add to what Mark is saying, Mike, I mean, at the end of the day, if you have a reservoir and you're going to be pumping it with CO2 or otherwise engaged in those activities, those pressures, etc, that are resultant of all that, alter the rock properties, and to alter the velocities and other things going on with respect to the overall seismic profile of the geology. You when you build on top of what our very high-resolution data acquisition can accomplish and add that analytics that Quantum can do there, there's just plenty of opportunity there to know, well, can I keep putting CO2 in? Do I need to stop? Is it staying there? How am I managing my sequestration operations?
