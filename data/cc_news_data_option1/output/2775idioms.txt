The Blues are now four points clear of Leicester and Manchester United, who play each other on the final day of the season, and have two matches remaining.
 However, Chelsea’s final league fixtures are away at champions Liverpool and at home to Wolves, who are not yet out of the running for a Champions League spot, and Loftus-Cheek does not want his side to be relying on other teams slipping up.
 "We have to manage the pressure," Loftus-Cheek told _the club's official website._
 "We’re used to it playing for Chelsea, that comes with it. We have to do the job, and we really want to be in the Champions League next year so we’ll give it our all.
 "We have two really tough games against Liverpool and Wolves to come, so it’s in our hands. We don’t want to be reliant on other results to put us through to the Champions League. We’re in a good position. We have got to nail it down and give it our all."
 Loftus-Cheek’s appearance against Norwich was just his second start since rupturing his Achilles in May 2019, and the midfielder acknowledged he is still building up his match fitness.
 The 24-year-old added: "I feel like I’m improving. My game’s coming on. I was really happy to start and get some more minutes.
 "This injury is a lot different to previous ones I have had, and the explosiveness is still to come, but I’m getting there."

However a slip in his previously lofty standards has led to greater scrutiny on his performances, with f ormer Red Devils skipper Roy Keane even declaring he was "sick to death" of the keeper following Tottenham's goal in the 1-1 draw back in June.
 Commenting on Steven Bergwijn's opener on _Sky Sports'_ coverage of the Premier League fixture, Keane said: "I would be fighting him at half-time. I would be swinging punches at that guy."
 However, speaking to _Stats Perform News,_ Matic explained that while he understands the role of those working in the media, De Gea remains in the top tier at his position.
 "I didn't see what he [Keane] said but I think we have to agree David is one of the best goalkeepers in the world," the United midfielder said
 "He has saved us many times, saved points. Everyone is allowed to have mistakes - we are human.
 "The pundits, their job is to say their opinions. They have to speak because one team loses. No problem - we respect them, and we will always try to improve."
 De Gea kept three clean sheets in four league outings after the draw with Spurs, though he was beaten twice as United drew with Southampton on Monday in his 400th appearance for the club.
 The result saw Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side miss the chance to climb into third place in the table above Chelsea, who duly won 24 hours later against Norwich City to increase the gap to four points.

The coronavirus pandemic has the college football season in a state of uncertainty regarding how -- or even if -- games will be played. Already, the Ivy League has decided to cancel its football schedule this fall, while still leaving open the possibility of moving the season to the spring.
   
 Will other schools follow suit? How will they balance the health of their athletes vs. the financial windfall football brings to institutions of all sizes?
   
 Heavyweight programs in the Power Five conferences have the most incentive to play their games as scheduled. Here is where they stand at the moment:
   
 SEC
   
 Southeastern Conference commissioner Greg Sankey has scheduled a meeting on Monday with the league's athletic directors to discuss plans for the upcoming football season.
   
 "The direct reality is not good," Sankey tweeted on Saturday after an appearance on ESPN Radio.
   
 Sankey said in the interview there needs to be significant changes in the current coronavirus numbers and pandemic-related behaviors before schools can think about playing football safely. He added that the SEC is working toward making a decision regarding the season in late July, but that his level of concern is "high to very high."
   
 ACC
   
 After delaying all fall sports until after Sept. 1, the ACC has discussed playing a conference-only football schedule, a league official told USA TODAY Sports last week. However, the ACC's only official statement has been that it will make a decision about the 2020 football season by the end of July.
   
 "As we continue to work on the best possible path forward for the return of competition, we will do so in a way that appropriately coincides with our universities' academic missions," commissioner John Swofford said. "Over the last few months, our conference has prepared numerous scenarios related to the fall athletics season."
   
 Big 12
   
 The Big 12 hasn't made any decisions about its football schedules yet, preferring instead to take a wait-and-see approach. However, commissioner Bob Bowlsby told ESPN on Friday his league is "kind of on the same schedule" as the SEC and ACC in expecting to have a plan in place by late July.
   
 Bowlsby has a previously scheduled meeting with conference athletic directors on Tuesday.
   
 Big Ten
   
 Ohio State athletic director Gene Smith said last week he's "very concerned" about playing any sports this fall. The Big Ten took a major step on Thursday in announcing its football teams will play only conference opponents, making it the first member of the Bowl Subdivision to take such as step.
   
 The move stunned many non-conference foes who will lose out on the guaranteed payouts they receive each year traveling to face Big Ten opponents. Of those 33 games that were canceled, USA TODAY Sports obtained contracts for 26 -- with payouts to visiting schools totaling nearly $22.2 million.
   
 In addition, several high-profile matchups -- including Ohio State at Oregon on Sept. 5 and Wisconsin vs. Notre Dame on Oct. 3 in Green Bay -- also fell by the wayside.
   
 Pac-12
   
 Following in the Big Ten's footsteps, the Pac-12 announced on Friday that its schools will be limited to conference games only this fall.
   
 "Our decisions have and will be guided by science and data, and based upon the trends and indicators over the past days, it has become clear that we need to provide ourselves with maximum flexibility to schedule, and to delay any movement to the next phase of return-to-play activities," Pac-12 commissioner Larry Scott said in a statement.
   
 The conference plans to release details on its conference-only schedules by the end of July. A non-conference clash between USC and Alabama in Arlington, Texas, is one of the Pac-12's biggest cancellations.
