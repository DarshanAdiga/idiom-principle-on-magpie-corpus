In 1979, dubious psychological techniques were used to put a teenager behind bars for life. These flawed ideas may still be at play in other criminal cases.

Jeremy Doss of Upper Lake, CA added another major event trophy to his growing collection, grabbing the $5,000 round one of the Race 2B Drug Free Big3 at Madera Speedway on Saturday night. Doss outfoxed multi-time NASCAR California State Champion Trevor Huddleston and two-time Nut Up Pro Late Model Champion Buddy Shepherd of Bakersfield for the victory.      The event served as round three of the Nut Up Pro Late Model Series as well and was streamed live for free to race fans due to the COVID-19 Pandemic closing the grandstands. The event will be telecast later this fall on MAVTV as well.      The initial start of the 100-lap feature saw a multi-car skirmish into turn one. On the next attempt, 2019 Nut Up Pro Late Model champion Austin Herzog of Clovis led the opening lap. Shepherd went around the outside of Napa’s Logan Zampa to take third on lap eight. Doss clamped down on Herzog and looked inside for the lead on the front stretch on lap 14. Doss took over the top spot on lap 15.      Shepherd then attacked Herzog, with the pair running side-by-side before contact into turn one on lap 18. Both Shepherd and Huddleston passed Herzog as a result. Herzog eventually drifted to seventh in front of Bakersfield’s Racin Vernon.      A caution flew on lap 38 for Michael Mitchell and Shelden Cooper making contact in turn four. On the restart, Shepherd and Huddleston had contact on the front stretch but managed to keep going. Ross Strmiska and Logan Zampa went side-by-side for fourth with Dylan Zampa also entering the discussion for the position.      The Zampa cars made contact coming to the halfway break, with Logan spinning one lap early with 49 laps officially scored complete.      Doss picked the inside on the restart out of the break for MAVTV interviews and adjustments. The decision went in Huddleston’s favor with the Irwindale champion charging past Shepherd in turn two to lead lap 50. Huddleston’s teammate Dean Thompson emerged on the restart in fifth after starting ninth.      Mtichell’s night ended with a hard crash that involved Oklahoma’s Holley Hollan on lap 65. Racin Vernon retired to the pits with a broken rear end as well. Huddleston, despite taking the lead on the outside, picked the inside for the upcoming restart. Doss took advantage to drive past Huddleston in an identical maneuver. Huddleston fell into a great battle with Buddy Shepherd that went back-and-forth on several occasions. Huddleston and Shepherd even made contact on lap 83 but Shepherd drove away.      Shepherd ran his best lap of the main event on lap 87 but it was too little too late as Jeremy Doss claimed the $5,000 Race 2B Drug Free Big3 100-lap feature win. Doss, Huddleston, Ross Strmiska, and Carlos Vieira rounded out the top-five.      The 51FIFTY Jr. Late Model Series featured a first-time winner who also became the new points leader. 14-year-old Bradley Erickson of Phoenix, AZ claimed fast-time and the 70-lap main event win over a field of 20 drivers ages 10-16 years old.      An all-female front row saw Colorado’s Holly Clark lead Bakersfield’s Kercie Jung after lap one. Jung found herself mired back in fifth early on after getting hung out on the top.      Erickson started to challenge Clark for the lead before a caution flew. Incoming points leader Seth Wise of Bakersfield had contact with Idaho’s Jody Moen, with Wise suffering some front-end damage.      Wise continued on while Erickson started outside Clark on the restart. Erickson used the top to his advantage to take the lead. Erickson picked the outside on each successive restart, while Jung took over third from Jake Bollman on lap 23. Jung then inherited second when Clark slid into turn one on lap 30. A lap later, Cody Kiemele’s night ended in a hard crash on the backstretch.      An incident involving Clark and Bollman brought out the scheduled break a lap early on lap 39. On the restart, a repaired Seth Wise led a train of cars past Jadan Walbridge. Walbridge ended up falling from third to sixth in the process.      Erickson used the outside throughout three additional restarts to maintain the lead over Jung en route to the victory. Jung equalled a series best finish for a female competitor with her second place effort. Wise, Bakesfield’s Kabe McClenny and Cole Brown rounded out the top-five.      Bradley Erickson’s 11-year-old brother Jeffrey Erickson won his third Bandolero main event of the 2020 season on Saturday night as well. Linden’s Wyatt Sansom managed to take the lead on several occasions during the caution- filled 30-lap feature. Erickson was able to claw back to Sansom within a lap or two on each try, however, making the final pass for the lead on lap 14.      Joey Kennealy rounded out the top-three in the Bandoleros while the Mini Cup race within a race saw Tracy’s Rebecca Dubie win her third consecutive event as well.

On a night where the racing was intense, the tempers were flaring and the summer heat was getting to everybody, Pro Modifieds driver Billy Knebel took not one but two checkered flags. As a result of a rainout two weeks earlier during the feature events, the Pro Modifieds division was given a make-up feature Saturday night and Knebel, who started on the pole position, and ran alongside Nick Justice for the lead. As Knebel pulled ahead on the back stretch of lap three, he looked as though nothing would slow him down until a spinout on the tenth lap with a lapped car would bump into his car and cause some damage. However, the damage wasn't severe enough to hinder him from finishing the race and he took to the checkered flag. Justice, who ran second in the feature, would slam the back stretch wall and pull up at the top of the third turn and end his feature. As a result of the heat race finishes, Justice would start on the pole and Knebel right behind him in the second row. The race would get slowed by cautions in the closing laps as Justice was holding on to the lead with the bottom side groove. As the white flag was flying, Knebel got just inside enough of Justice to take the lead away onto the back stretch and take to the win. Justice would race hard to the finish with Kyle Helmick as Helmick got hooked to the rear left tire as both finished the race tangled together. The Pro Late Models would also complete a make-up feature from two weeks ago as Jose Parga and Aaron Heck would battle neck and neck and pass back and forth for the 20-lap feature. Parga would hold off Heck in the first feature of the night. In the nightly feature, Parga was challenging for the top spots but would have some issues with the drivers in front of him and would cause some collisions and spin outs. Jake Little was in the lead and would hold off the rest of the competitors for the checkered flag. Again, Aaron Heck would be in a position to challenge for the lead but again fell short of the top spot. In the BillingsleyRewards.com Modifieds, the seventh place starter would make a pass with six laps left to grab hold of his first Macon Speedway feature of the season. Ray Bollinger of Kewanee drove two hours south to test the track and get ready for the Summer Nationals race that is coming August 13th. A solid stacked lineup saw him as well as Jeremy Nichols, Curt and Zach Rhodes, defending class champion Tommy Sheppard, Jr. Rodney Standerfer, Alan Crowder, Guy Taylor and Danny Smith compete for 20 laps. Curt Rhodes was the fastest car at the outset as he ran the bottom. Jeremy Nichols contended for the lead and took off from the top groove into the lead and looked like he would finish off the race until Bollinger cut underneath two drivers on the bottom and took the second spot away. Following a restart on lap 14, Bollinger passed Nichols and the rest was history. In the Archer's Alley Street Stocks, Bobby Beiler got around Jeff Reed, Jr. and ran away from the 17-car field en route to another feature win. His fast Street Stock coasted along the high banks of the dirt oval and netted his third feature win in the five racing weeks at Macon Speedway. Dennis Vandermeersch made short work of the Sportsman division 15-lapper. After an early start for former track champion Wes O'Dell, Vandermeersch got past him and blasted off like a rocket with the lead. O'Dell would fall victim to a broken car and pull in to the infield shortly thereafter. The Hornet division finished off the night with Erik Vanapeldoorn winning the feature event. The win was his second of the season after winning the make-up feature from two weeks ago during last week's program. The evening was full of excitement and mayhem and racing and was sponsored by CEFCU as the Kids Club was held for the first time in 2020. Six divisions bringing in over 100 racecars were able to bring some enjoyment to the fans of the 75-year-old track. Macon Speedway shifts its attention to next Saturday and the first visit of the season by the POWRi Midgets & Micro Sprints as they race during Illinois Speed Week. Stock car racing classes will also be part of the program. The Illinois Speed Week will wrap up Sunday at Lincoln Speedway with the POWRi divisions. Macon Speedway PR
