OTTAWA - International Development Minister Karina Gould isn't running any victory laps despite ending 2020 by doing what so few of her political predecessors could — wrestling a sizable increase in Canadian foreign-aid spending.
 Gould announced a $485-million increase in Canada's $5.9-billion overseas development assistance budget this week, money earmarked for new international efforts to ensure the equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines to poor countries.
 As welcome as a vaccine will be, it won't cure the damage the global COVID-19 pandemic inflicted over the course of this year.
 Gould says the pandemic, in less than one year, wiped out a decade's worth of progress in improving the plight of the world's poorest people, especially children.
 The damage includes a dramatic drop in kids going to school, declining access to vaccines already used to combat preventable diseases, declining nutrition and soaring food insecurity.
 It's a warning that Gould has sounded often since the pandemic descended in the spring.
 "What we're talking about in international development is a decade of lost gains," Gould said in an interview with The Canadian Press this past week.
 "That has been my consistent message to colleagues and partners around the world: that we cannot lose focus; we must stay the course on the importance of directives that we have in development, in addition to responding to COVID-19."
 Gould cited the 270 million people who have fallen into extreme food insecurity, double the amount previously, as well as the fact that millions of girls around the world have been deprived of school.
 The longer girls are out of school, the less likely they are to return, she said.
 "We're talking about an additional 10 million child brides," said Gould. "There are a lot of things to be worried about."
 The same day as she announced Canada's new aid money, Gould took part in a web-based conference where she announced how $520 million of previously allocated federal development funding would be spent to fight rising malnutrition.
 Henrietta Fore, the head of the United Nations Children Fund, said one-third of the world's children under age five are malnourished. "At least two in three are still not receiving the minimum diet that they need to grow, to develop and to learn, and to reach their full potential."
 Fore said UNICEF estimates that 87 million fewer children this year will get the required doses of Vitamin A they need to stay healthy, a 35 per cent decline over 2019 last year.
 "That hurts not just children, it hurts us all," she said.

OTTAWA - Jagmeet Singh is being squeezed.
 Crowded on one side by spend-happy Liberals, on another by socially conscious Greens and, most recently, by Conservatives homing in on working-class voters, the NDP leader has his elbows up to hold ground for the traditional party of labour.
 At first glance, that ground may seem shaky. It sits within a minority Parliament where Singh was cornered into propping up the Liberal government in an October confidence vote tied to the WE Charity affair. And it’s overshadowed by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who routinely steals the spotlight as lead player in the COVID-19 drama.
 But as tight as his situation looks, Singh can point to bright spots on the orange horizon.
 The NDP is poised to pay off its $10-million campaign debt from the 2019 election before January, he told The Canadian Press in a year-end interview.
 And battles to bolster government aid for Canadians hit hardest by the pandemic mark selling points Singh can point to when pitching voters.
 “I came down to the wire in negotiations (with the Liberals), saying we will not support specific legislation or a specific motion … unless you guarantee to continue CERB,” he said, referring to the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, the $500-a-week income support rolled out amid historic job losses last spring.
 Singh has also claimed credit for boosting the federal wage subsidy to 75 per cent from a planned 10 per cent in March, and for ensuring paid sick leave made it into the fiscal update last month.
 He also doesn’t appear perturbed about Conservative Leader Erin O’Toole’s push to appeal to working-class Canadians.
 “What have they actually done?” Singh asked, noting that Tories said the CERB discouraged Canadian workers from weaning off federal aid.
 “They cannot say that working-class people are demonstrably better off because of them. They can't.”
 For his part, O'Toole has said a $1,200 payment next year for parents with kids under six — included in the fall economic update — was in his leadership campaign platform.
 With the Liberals ditching fiscal anchors, ballooning the deficit to a projected $382 billion, and unveiling an ambitious carbon-pricing plan, the Conservatives might have more policy wiggle room as they make their case to trade workers and suburban parents.
 “There are a lot more blue-orange switchers than people may assume from the get-go. Not everybody moves on the ideological scale in a linear pattern,” said Karl Bélanger, president of consulting firm Traxxion Strategies and former senior adviser to the NDP.
 O’Toole’s efforts in this area mirror U.K. Conservative Prime Minister Boris Johnson's successful bid to lure voters away from the Labour party in 2019. It also bears some resemblance to the populist Reform party’s traction with disappointed NDP voters in the 1993 federal election in Canada.

An NGO, Women for Women International (WFWI) says it has trained over 5,200 grassroots women on promoting girl-child education and ending violence against women and girls in communities.   The Country Director, WFWI, Ms Bukola Onyishi, said this in Abuja on the sideline of a one-day strategic meeting to develop action plan on priority actions for its Change Agents.   The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the meeting was held in collaboration with Women’s Rights Advancement and Protection Alternative (WRAPA).   Onyishi said the grassroots women, also known as Change Agents were trained in batches for 12 months.   She said that the women were trained under the organisation’s five years project with the support from Netherlands government, under the Funding Leadership and Opportunity for Women.   She said that they were trained to identify problems in their communities, sensitise the people, engage with decision makers as well as power holders in bringing a change and ensure implementation of gender responsive laws and policies.   “These they have done and they put plans into action. At the community level, they have issues like rape in communities, inheritance problems, education for the girl child and others.   “It is important that their voices were heard or amplified at both the state and national levels, and engaged with their legislators for people to know their pain at the grassroots level,” she said.   Onyishi, said though the project would end in 2020, the women were expected to sustain it by continuing to amplify their voices on issues affecting women and girls in their communities so as to bring an end to negative vices.   She appealed to relevant stakeholders to support the women to be able to continue with the projects in order to be able to bring about positive and impactful changes in the communities.   Also speaking, the Director, Programme and Administration, WRAPA, Anita Ari, stressed the need for the change agents to sustain their advocacy programmes to promote girl-child education, women empowerment and ending violence at the grassroots level.   “The action plan is one of the sustainability plan because if they have it, they will be able to use it to get funding to continue to do the work they are doing because WFWI that had been supporting them will not be there forever.   “Also, we plan for them to have a registered entities that are legally opearing because there is an implication for establishment that are not legally registered not to live up to their obligations, especially when they get funding from philanthropists,” she said.   Ms Tamwakat Hassan, a participant and a Change Agent, from Plateau state said the impact of the training had reduced prevalence of violence against women and girls, land inheritance issues as well as promoted girl-child education at the grassroots.   Hassan, therefore, appealed to the government to fully implement the Violence Against People (Prohibition) Act (2015), Child Rights Acts and other policies that would protect the women and children and ensure offenders were prosecuted.

"This is the beginning of the last chapter of the book," he said.  
 One health care worker said she can "see the light at the end of the tunnel" now that she's been vaccinated. Another said the vaccine will allow her to hug her mother for the first time in 10 months.
 As of Friday, at least 50,000 Americans have been vaccinated, many of whom are health care workers fighting on the frontlines of the pandemic. Millions more doses are expected by the end of the year, and the U.S. aims to give 100 million Americans their first dose of a vaccine before April.
 But the vaccine rollout has not come without controversy. More than 10 states have said that they have been told they will receive fewer doses of Pfizer's vaccine next week than expected. Some states say they will now receive 40% fewer doses than expected.
 To deepen public confidence in the vaccine, Vice President Mike Pence publicly received his first dose earlier Friday. President-elect Joe Biden and first lady Dr. Jill Biden are set to be vaccinated on Monday, and Vice President- elect Kamala Harris and her husband will follow a week later. At least 42 members of Congress, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have also been vaccinated.
 The authorization also comes as the nation is reporting staggering hospitalizations and deaths from the virus. In California, only 2% of the state's ICU beds are available -- and in Southern California, not a single ICU bed is open. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation now predicts more than 560,000 people nationwide will have died of the virus by April 1.
 President Trump reacted to the vaccine news on Twitter, writing "Congratulations, the Moderna vaccine is now available!" President-elect Biden also released a statement, writing that authorization of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines "assures us that brighter days lie ahead."

On several different occasions over the last few months, I’ve spent a great deal of time thinking about what exactly Nebraska’s endgame was in pushing so hard for a college football season.
 There have been flashes from head coach Scott Frost’s bunch, sure. The first half of Nebraska’s victory over Penn State, the Huskers’ valiant second-half effort against a very good Iowa team and the victory over Purdue definitely spring to mind.
 But overall, results have been mixed. It’s fair to say that there’s been a lot — and I mean a lot — more bad than there’s been good for Nebraska football. When Frost’s bunch is getting blasted at home by Illinois or losing inexplicably to an undermanned Minnesota team, all while serving as the butt of every joke in the college football world, it’s fair to question what the point of all this is.

 However, neither the District Collector nor the Superintendent of Police had visited the hamlet as mandated by the laws, the fact-finding team claimed. The National Commission for SC/ST too had not yet visited the spot, the villagers and the affected families told the team, he said.
 Under such circumstances, the three accused, who were behind bars, had approached the court seeking bail. When the case came up for hearing two days ago, the complainant, Chitra (one of the victim’s mothers) had objected to the bail application. She had stated that the boys were under severe depression after they were forced to remove the excreta. She also said that two of the boys had left the village and gone to a relative’s house.
 The government should give compensation to each of the boys immediately. The district administration should arrange for special counselling by trained psychologists for the boys as they were terribly disturbed after the incident. The parents too were upset over the remarks made by the caste Hindu youths, Mr. Kathir said.
 On December 11, when the SC boys, who had openly defecated on a portion of a plot of land, which was being used as a playground by some of the caste Hindu youths in the hamlet, they were forced to remove the excreta in a gunny sack.

Martinez overcame his four-turnover showing, completing 24-of-28 passes for 255 yards and one touchdown while posting a career-high 157 rushing yards and two touchdowns. Mills was even better, with 25 carries for a career-high 196 yards. Robinson had over 100 total yards and one touchdown. As a team Nebraska managed 620 yards of total offense, the most since 2019.
 There are causes for concern, sure. Rutgers’ offense was putrid without the services of former Husker quarterback and current senior Noah Vedral, and it’s incredibly concerning that Rutgers made a close contest of Friday’s game despite managing just nine first downs and 252 yards of offense.
 Nebraska’s aforementioned special teams woes are also cause to worry. The Huskers conceded a brutal fake punt in the first quarter that Rutgers easily converted, and also allowed 192 kickoff yards and a touchdown — an average of 38.4 yards per return.
 Yet, none of this is what I’m ultimately taking away from Friday’s regular- season finale, the first game of what the Big Ten dubbed “Champions Week.” A majority of postgame conversation, whether fairly or unfairly, focused on whether or not Nebraska would accept a bowl invitation.
 The Huskers’ 3-5 record certainly makes this a possibility. Plenty of power conference teams have already denied invitations to play postseason football, citing a desire to end a grueling, isolated season for a game that, in all honesty, won’t mean much when all is said and done.
 Frost in the past has expressed his desire to get the Huskers bowl-eligible in the early years of his tenure. The extra practices are a great way to develop young talent and perhaps garner a bit of momentum for the season ahead. They’re great money makers for universities and are usually great ways to get more national exposure on a program.
 However, think back to everything that these student-athletes and coaches have gone through just so a season could even be played. All that really needs to be done is to look at how exhausted Frost and Martinez looked postgame talking to the media. Friday night’s win may have been the last bit of energy either could put towards this season.
 Martinez said he hasn’t seen his family since March. He’s not alone, as Frost said postgame that several players are in Martinez’s boat. At a certain point, the mental and physical well-being of Nebraska’s student-athletes need to be considered as seriously as the long-term benefits of sneaking into the Duke’s Mayo Bowl.
 Frost’s 2020 has been difficult off the field as well. In a vulnerable moment, he touched on how difficult coaching has been after losing his father earlier this year. This hasn’t been easy by any means for Nebraska’s head man.
 “This whole year has been hard. Again, I don't want anybody to feel sorry for me. There's a lot of people that have it worse than I do,” Frost said. “I lost Dad, this year. I really expected us to turn a big corner this year, and that we had the team to do that. And I still do. I’m really excited about the future. But I'm worn out too.”
 Call Friday night what you will. A late-season push for Nebraska’s first chance at a bowl game in a few years? Sure. But to me, this signified something else. Overcoming four turnovers and shoddy special teams play for a one-score road victory may have been Nebraska emptying the tank for the final time in 2020.
 And if that is the case, nobody can blame them for it.

Ferrari team boss Mattia Binotto expects Mick Schumacher to have a tough Formula One debut with Haas next year before getting more up to speed in 2022.Schumacher, the son of Ferrari great and seven times F1 world champion Michael, won the Formula Two title this year and has graduated to the U.S.-owned team with close ties to Maranello.Haas scored only three points this season and ended up ninth of the 10 teams."I think it will be very difficult for him at the start," Binotto told reporters in a video conference when asked what he expected from the 21-year-old Ferrari Academy driver."If I look at his past experience in both F2 and F3, normally he is delivering his best in the second season and not the first."I think Mick, the way he has developed himself, is learning a lot on the first season and becomes very strong in the second half of the second season. That’s why I think two seasons will be important for him."But already on the second I’m expecting to see progress compared to the first one."Ferrari have held open the possibility of Schumacher one day racing for them but they have Charles Leclerc on a long- term contract while Spaniard Carlos Sainz has signed an initial two-year deal that could be extended.They also have close ties with Swiss-based Alfa Romeo, who could also be a future destination for Schumacher after Haas, depending on progress.Binotto said he wanted to see Schumacher getting progressively faster."I’m really expecting him to prove how fast he is in an F1 context, both qualifying and the race...to prove that he is very strong in race pace and consistent in terms of bringing the car home in a good position," he said.Ferrari have strengthened their ties with Haas ahead of next season, with their chassis engineering head Simone Resta transferring across.Binotto said more Ferrari personnel would follow Resta out as the team is forced to shed staff to meet the terms of a budget cap being introduced next year."A few other technicians will move, reducing our organisation which is required for the budget cap but strengthening the organisation of our customers and partner teams," he said.Those transferred to Haas would remain at Maranello but working out of a completely separate facility with no access to the main Ferrari building, Binotto added.

Throughout the opening exchanges of the match, he did an excellent job of knitting things together in the final third, with quick one-touch passing and tidy footwork in tight spaces.
 It was some clever work with the ball at his feet that led to the first goal of the game after he weaved his way into the box before being brought down for a penalty, following a clumsy challenge from a Leeds defender.
 The United youngster was quick to dust himself off and plant the ball down confidently on the spot. His confidence was reaffirmed after a deft panenka hit down the middle of the goal put his team 1-0 up.
 McNeill then doubled the lead just before half-time thanks to some quick thinking and a sharp turn of pace. He latched onto a swiftly hit ball played over the top of the Leeds defence and got there before the chasing defender and sweeping keeping who he knocked the ball past before dribbling into the penalty area and nonchalantly lobbing the ball into the goal from an extremely tight angle.
 McNeill’s impressive work on the day wasn’t all about just what he did on the ball. He also pressed coherently with fellow forwards around him when his team were out of possession, knowing what passing angles to cut out and how to make life more difficult for Leeds players trying to pass their way up the field.
 He also illustrated really good spatial awareness, moving around the attacking third and dropping into pockets of spaces that appeared within Leeds’ defensive shape. His good technical skill and general two-footedness meant that in these moments, his first touch was normally a progressive one that would aid him in evading tackles and pressure from opponents.
 As the game progressed and with two goals already to his name, Leeds defenders aimed to nullify McNeill's threat by getting as tight as they could when he received the ball into feet. It was a tactic that dampened his impact at stages, leading to some loose touches and elements of frustration.
 His annoyance did boil over at one point, after he kicked out at a defender who went in a little too hard with one tackle near the halfway line late in the first half.

Earlier this year, I wrote a Student News column outlining all the reasons why 2020 was a disaster of a year and why we must get our act together if we want 2021 to be any different. And while it is necessary for us to understand all of the lows, now, as the year is rounding off (13 days and counting), it is equally important to pay attention to the highs. Because, as the ubiquitous quote says, there is always light in the darkness.
 The election of 2020 greatly defined the final quarter of this year and, though it had its own struggles, it must be noted that far more people were interested in the political situation of the country than expected. Americans generally don’t have the best track record when it comes to voting. In 2016, we ended up far trailing behind our fellow nations in 30th place out of the 35 countries for which voter data is available. This election, however, was an anomaly. The Washington Post reports that more people have voted this year than in any other election in the past 120 years. Voter turnout was massive this year. Over 100 million citizens voted in early polls alone and, in total, two thirds of eligible Americans got out there to get their voices heard. We defied all expectations — voter suppression, civil strife and a literal pandemic — to get out there and get our voices heard. For that we must be applauded.
 The conspicuous crises of 2020 overshadowed the underlying and rapidly accelerating climate change crisis. However, thanks to the mandatory stay-at- home orders encompassing the world, the climate was actually helped with momentous drops in carbon emissions. There was about a 7% decline, researchers found, which translates to about 2.4 billion tons of carbon emissions. That, to say the least, is a lot. Individual countries also saw major drops compared to years previous, with the United Kingdom’s emissions going down by 13% and France’s reducing by 15%. Though this in no way means we can suddenly forget about climate change, we can and should celebrate this change as the first step to a long road of recovery.
 Most recently, we finally got a coronavirus vaccine developed in record time. The Pfizer vaccine was approved for emergency distribution by the Food and Drug Administration Dec. 10, and distribution began this week. It has an impressive 95% efficacy rate, and the side effects have been mostly minor and safe. This is a major milestone considering the fact that vaccines generally take years to develop. Indeed, the fastest created vaccine was the mumps vaccine, and that took about four years to make. Pfizer’s was created under the pressure of a global pandemic, and so was churned out in under a year. This means that there is finally an end in sight for this disaster. The New York Times reports that if enough people are vaccinated — about 70% of our population — life can return to normal as early as late spring or early summer of next year.
 I won’t say that this year was OK, or that the good outweighed the bad, because that isn’t true. However, I will say that 2020 allowed us to slow down and take into account what really mattered in our lives. This year was historical, no other way to put it, and it would do well for us to reflect, and then move on to 2021 with a fresh start.

In reporting on the transformative thinking Native communities are putting into action in these tumultuous times, I heard time and time again: “This is not our first pandemic.” Since the 1500s, when ever-larger numbers of Europeans began arriving in this hemisphere, disasters have come thick and fast for the First Nations, including tens of millions wiped out within a century by continual waves of unfamiliar diseases—measles, influenza, smallpox, typhus, diphtheria, and more. Village after village stood empty. Enduring shock and grief, the survivors relied on ancient lifeways to support them as new trials arose.

We may even be ready for empathy. In 1776, our founders claimed the new nation aspired to achieve _e pluribus unum_ —“out of many, one”—the motto on our Great Seal and currency. However, the wealthy and powerful of the time quickly began to apply that ideal to only themselves as they grabbed land and resources for personal gain and took steps to ensure their privileged status. The political and social cacophony of recent years has further drowned out expressions of compassion and unity. If we listen carefully, we can hear the rational, gracious, intensely determined voices of the nation’s First Peoples as they explain how, in very practical ways, we can go about caring for each other and thereby achieve a stronger whole.

Caffery: “I mean we’ve been speaking about it for the last 20 years now, since the last record. It’s always able to happen and something else stops it - you’ve got Haley’s Comet coming around once in a while, and every hundred years you have a pandemic, and once every 20 years there’s a Savatage record. It will be 20 years in 2022 so maybe that’s when it will show up. I’m kind of hopeful that it does, I know I’ve done a lot of writing, and Jon has, and Al (Pitrelli - TSO’s Music Director and lead guitarist) always has a lot of music, so we could make a record. Things would never be exactly the same without Paul, but they were never exactly the same without Criss Oliva either, but we still managed to do Dead Winter Dead and Wake Of Magellan and Poets And Madmen. Songs like ‘Chance’ were done after Criss had passed, so we were able to keep things alive. Especially me and Jon, we channel the same spirit that’s always been there, that’s something very unique about Savatage. Somebody who has been a Savatage fan their whole life asked me today; no matter how many bands they interview or how many records they hear, they’ve not really heard anyone who has come along to take up the torch for Savatage. That meant a lot to me because that means we did something that special. I don’t think anyone came along and took the torch for The Beatles - I’m not saying that Savatage is The Beatles - and I don’t think that anybody is going to take over for Freddie Mercury from Queen. It just means we did something special. When you hear that, it means you filled your hole - like Eddie Van Halen did for guitar, there are lots of guitar players, but only one Eddie Van Halen. I definitely think there’s only going to be one Savatage. I think we have our own little spot, and as I watch how our music has grown with people and how it’s developed over the years and how much bigger the band has gotten without us even trying - it’s worldwide - we want to go play because there are so many places just waiting to see it. For a lot of people, it will be the first time because we haven’t played a lot of these places in 20 years. It would be amazing to get out and get the younger kids to see this band. It’s a special band. I don’t necessarily take advantage of it, but I’ve been living it, and I’ve been a part of what’s happened with it. It’s definitely a great band, and there’s a lot of great bands that you can say that about - that there’s only going to be this one band - to me I think that’s special when you can identify a band like that on their own, for being that particularly special.

Caffery: “No, I don’t think so at all, I think when TSO was able to get off the ground because it was something that Paul had had in his head to do for a very long time, and all of us from Savatage were included in it, he never disconnected the two worlds because he knew how, as you said, underrated or unrecognized Savatage was and I think ultimately that was part of his plan, to get a lot of our music released through that channel. And then getting Streets to broadway and bringing that music alive - things like Dead Winter Dead and stuff like that. I think we were progressing, we were getting to music like ‘Chance’ and ‘Hourglass’ with Savatage on the road, and ‘Gutter Ballet’ when we played Europe. There were a lot of Savatage songs in the second half of the set on one of those Beethoven tours. I think it was always there. The Criss Oliva guitars would pop out of the ground on the screens. There was something really special with Paul and the Olivas, a special relationship, a special creative relationship. Especially the way Paul and John Oliva would write ballads, it was very special the way that stuff would come out. I mean, Paul loved that band. He loved Criss Oliva and his playing and he loved everything that we did. For me, I started working with him at such a young age, I’d never really worked for anyone else before. There was only about a year and a half total when I wasn’t working with John and Doctor Butcher on something, so I didn’t spend a lot of time away from the organization and I watched a lot of really incredible things happen in my life and my career from Paul. I mean, the guy was a genius. I think that happens with anybody you’re really super close with, sometimes you don’t realize just how lucky you are because they’re kind of like air, it’s there all the time, but if you cut my air off right now, I couldn’t breathe. So losing Paul, it was tremendously different for me, and it will be tremendously different without him forever because there are so many things that he would make happen that I couldn’t even dream of imagining, because he would make the impossible possible. That was his whole thing.”

Endlessly quotable - "This morning I caught my first tube" - and endlessly enjoyable, it's up there with The Matrix in terms of career high performances from Reeves though his character, FBI agent Johnny Utah, is closer to Bill And Ted territory. The plot: Johnny has to learn to ride in order to infiltrate Swayze's gang of surfer dude stick-up artists. He does. He likes it and he likes them - a little too much, in fact.

A tip of the cap to Ryan Ruef of Lee. On Nov. 21, he was out bowhunting alone in one of his favorite hunting areas in the southern Berkshires. He was in his climbing stand enjoying the 44-degree weather and watching for a big buck which he knew frequented the area. He previously spotted it on a trail camera and it appeared to have 18 points!
 Around 2:15 p.m., he saw the buck approaching him and when he got about 40 yards away, Ryan let his arrow fly. He waited about an hour before beginning to track it. During that time, he saw another big buck, a 12-pointer, chase a doe past his stand. He had to let it go for he thought that maybe he had limited out (2 bucks limit per year). He had gotten a smaller deer earlier during archery season.
 Finally, he began tracking his deer and luckily, it only traveled about 20 yards. That was the deer he was waiting for. Instead of 18 points, it had 15, but he knew it was the same deer for three of the points had been previously broken off probably during the rut while fighting off other bucks.
 After field dressing it, Ryan’s work really began for he had to drag the big buck out of the woods, a distance he estimated to be about 1 1/2 miles. When he got it home, he weighed it and it tipped his reliable scales at 180 pounds, (live weight, it is estimated to have been about 225-230 pounds). The 15 points were, in his opinion, scorable using the Pope and Young scoring criteria, and the ”green” beam length was 155 inches. MassWildlife estimated the deer to be 5 1/2 years old.
 Ryan is having the head mounted by Ricky Nelson of Spencer, Mass. What a great mount that will be.
 He is all done deer hunting for the year and now has to get back to studying for his finals. He is a senior at MCLA.

From the looks of things, if these two batsmen don’t mend their ways in the next few games, this could well be their last tour of Australia.
 The last time India went Down Under, one of the national selectors had made a telling statement about India vs Australia Test series. He had said that India’s only and best chance to win in Australia was in 2018-19, because the hosts were without the services of David Warner and Steven Smith.
 Interestingly though, Warner didn’t play the first Test while Smith only scored two runs in the entire match. So what horrors are in store for India during the remaining three matches?
 All Indian fans would be praying that the team shows a semblance of fight before series is over. The ghosts of the batting collapse in Adelaide are likely to haunt the Men in Blue for a while. And the Australian bowlers - in particular Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins, who did everything right by pitching the ball in the right areas and allowing the bouncy pitch to do its bit - would have their tails up for the rest of the series.
 Unlike their batting, India’s bowling looks fairly alright on paper at this stage of the series. But the likes of Jasprit Bumrah and Ravichandran Ashwin need some runs on the board to defend, and it remains to be seen whether the Indian batsmen can do that in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane.

Pune: Unlike other sectors and businesses that are limping back to normalcy following relaxation of lockdown restrictions, those working at Budhwar peth as a commercial sex worker (CSW) still await customers.
 Despite opting for new adaptive measures like phone sex, masks and gloves as the job involves physical contact, customers are hesitant to visit fearing risk of the infection.
 Located at the heart of Pune, Budhwar peth offers a contrasting picture with areas like Laxmi road, Tulshibaug and Mandai overcrowded with shoppers while the narrow bylanes where the CSWs run business wear a deserted look.
 One of the oldest and largest red-light areas in the state, Budhwar peth houses around 3,000 sex workers earning their livelihood at the 700 small and big brothels. Though CSWs were permitted to reopen their business in June, measures like phone sex and other standard operating procedures (SOPs) have failed to attract customers, said Tejaswi Sevekari, executive director of Pune-based NGO Saheli.
 With no new customer visits and only regulars trickling back, survival for these workers has become difficult.
 "It is unpredictable as to when the business will again pick up," said Sevekari, whose NGO has been working for CSWs for more than two decades.
 In November, the Maharashtra government decided to provide financial help of Rs 15,000 to each registered commercial sex worker for a period of three months from October to December 2020. However, in the absence of bank account, transfer of funds has not happened for some.
 "I don't have any paper or bank account. Hence, I have not received any state aid," said a CSW, who has been in the business for over 10 years after coming to the city from Hindi heartland. In existence since the Peshwa era, most CSWs in the red-light area of Budhwar peth have mostly migrated from West Bengal, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.
 "When the lockdown restrictions were lifted, we thought the worst is over. But the number of clients visiting us is very low as per our expectations," she said.
 "The CSWs opted for online measures, but with limited success. The women are not trained to do that and are also afraid of losing their confidentiality" said Sevekari.
 The major reason for few footfall, apart from the obvious crippling fear of contracting Covid-19, is the fact that majority of clientele are struggling as they belong to the class worst hit by the lockdown, according to the NGO.

An effort to get a warming center up and running for homeless people in the Lewiston-Clarkston Valley has been frozen out by technical difficulties, but the group working on the problem is far from giving up hope.
 Twin County United Way CEO Suzanne Johnson said the topic came up in early October during an interagency meeting. Members formed a subcommittee that has met weekly since then, but Johnson said several obstacles have cropped up. The main issue has been finding a nonprofit organization big enough to take the lead.
 “That is where we’ve really been stuck, finding that 501(c)(3),” Johnson said, using tax code shorthand for a nonprofit. “Part of the reason is that we need someone to be liable.”
 Tri-State Memorial Hospital in Clarkston was poised to become the lead agency, but Johnson said she learned Thursday that the hospital board is now asking for a clause in the potential contract exempting it from any litigation.
 The subcommittee also wanted to get away from the “weather-activated” model that has been used in past years by organizations like the now-defunct ROC or First Step 4 Life, where the warming center would only open on nights that dropped below a certain temperature. That ruled out some nonprofits that didn’t have enough staff members and volunteers to cover unpredictable shifts.
 “If it’s open every single night, it’s much easier to hire people if they know they have a reliable schedule,” Johnson said. “I don’t have the bandwidth if someone called in sick to staff that. And basically, it’s the same situation with everyone that’s on these calls.”
 And then there’s the coronavirus pandemic to consider. The Salvation Army of Lewiston saw its candidacy to become the lead agency fall by the wayside because of a policy that doesn’t allow anyone into its 21st Street headquarters with COVID-19 symptoms like sneezing or coughing, Johnson said.
 “And that is almost all of the homeless population,” she said of those forced to spend long hours outside in the damp, chilly air.
 Johnson has mainly been working with the LC Valley Youth Resource Center and the Willow Center for Grieving Children to identify a lead agency since none of those groups are large enough to take on the responsibility. City of Lewiston officials like City Manager Alan Nygaard and Police Chief Budd Hurd are also helping with the search for a lead agency.
 Once someone takes the reins, Johnson said it should be fairly quick and straightforward to apply for emergency funding from groups like the Innovia Foundation and the Lewis-Clark Valley Healthcare Foundation.
 Finding a location has been another challenge. The Lewiston Community Center was briefly a candidate, but the after-hours activities there eliminated that option. Another possibility is the donation of a large shed which the owner has volunteered to insulate and wire for power. But that would be a last resort.
 “While yes, it’s warm and better than being outside, it would be very hard to safely staff,” Johnson said. “We’re kind of stuck between a rock and a hard place.”
 For now, Johnson appealed to community members to contact her at (208) 743-6594 or sjohnson@tcuw.org if they can take the lead. She also said Twin County United Way can accept and hold donations until a formal organization solidifies. And even though the effort has been challenging and unfruitful so far, Johnson is determined to help create a warming center for the remaining weeks of this cold season, and for the years to come.
 “Nobody deserves to be sleeping outside in 30 degree or lower temperatures,” she said. “I won’t stop until we have something.”

But as tight as his situation looks, Singh can point to bright spots on the orange horizon.
 The NDP is poised to pay off its $10-million campaign debt from the 2019 election before January, he told The Canadian Press in a year-end interview.
 And battles to bolster government aid for Canadians hit hardest by the pandemic mark selling points Singh can point to when pitching voters.
 “I came down to the wire in negotiations (with the Liberals), saying we will not support specific legislation or a specific motion … unless you guarantee to continue CERB,” he said, referring to the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, the $500-a-week income support rolled out amid historic job losses last spring.
 Singh has also claimed credit for boosting the federal wage subsidy to 75 per cent from a planned 10 per cent in March, and for ensuring paid sick leave made it into the fiscal update last month.
 He also doesn’t appear perturbed about Conservative Leader Erin O’Toole’s push to appeal to working-class Canadians.
 “What have they actually done?” Singh asked, noting that Tories said the CERB discouraged Canadian workers from weaning off federal aid.
 “They cannot say that working-class people are demonstrably better off because of them. They can't.”
 For his part, O'Toole has said a $1,200 payment next year for parents with kids under six — included in the fall economic update — was in his leadership campaign platform.
 With the Liberals ditching fiscal anchors, ballooning the deficit to a projected $382 billion, and unveiling an ambitious carbon-pricing plan, the Conservatives might have more policy wiggle room as they make their case to trade workers and suburban parents.
 “There are a lot more blue-orange switchers than people may assume from the get-go. Not everybody moves on the ideological scale in a linear pattern,” said Karl Bélanger, president of consulting firm Traxxion Strategies and former senior adviser to the NDP.
 O’Toole’s efforts in this area mirror U.K. Conservative Prime Minister Boris Johnson's successful bid to lure voters away from the Labour party in 2019. It also bears some resemblance to the populist Reform party’s traction with disappointed NDP voters in the 1993 federal election in Canada.

The tiny homes’ small size has the advantage of encouraging people to be out and about, according to Reiter. “We wanted to make sure people who live there are spending as much time as possible outside,” he says. “One of our greatest teachers is the Earth, and she will teach you all you need to know if you’re willing to listen. …We hope the tiny homes will open those doors again. They have been closed by colonization and the hustle and bustle of this life.”

All title, babe 10,000 a month every month Clickbank, now we come Clickbank com There’s my account and there’s the glamour I’m promoting 100 horses 50% Commission that’s what I’m talking about I’m gonna conclude 10 magnificent a month every month Ok, make that 50 percent 10 stately parted for 50% Commission’s 50 horses. That’s awesome 50 horses I need to start 10 gloriou Holy Shh Look and sound familiar Well, that was me precisely a few short months ago looking to promote Anything I could on Clickbank trying to make that Commission trying to try to draw that ten thousand dollars a month Which was my first goal and it seemed that Every time I promoted something from Clickbank and I got it set up and I invested all day Or daytimes getting the pour set up the autoresponder setup, you know my followup emails I would get everything into arrange Get it completely set up start send transaction to it and then I’ll start the process all over again with another Clickbank product, but I could never get close to that $10,000 a month no matter how many products I promoted now.I’m not picking on Clickbank. I suppose click makes a great website To start your affiliate market business. I’ve hit coin promoting things on Clickbank I’ve just never attained ten thousand dollars a month promoting things on Clickbank So I decided I was going to educate myself and I made a gruesome discovery I discovered that I was it’s continuing to spin my motors over and over again Spending all of my time that I had which wasn’t much promoting these parts so when I learned how I could 10 x my business by apply one simple strategy and I Implemented that strategy that’s when my business Grew and that’s when my Commission’s grew by ten times what I was drawing so going into the one policy that I Altered and that I am currently doing that. It’s 10 x to my income is really skyrocketed my business and The nice thing is that anybody can do this.I had a switch go off in my thought and that Switch was go from promoting low-pitched ticket parts and start promoting high-pitched ticket items now what happens a lot of eras with affiliate purveyors and this happened to me is that you don’t have a Belief that you can actually sell a high ticket item. I necessitate, why would anybody buy anything from me? They don’t know me from Adam So let me just go ahead and stick with these $50 produces and maybe I can move 20 or 25 horses per auction believes me I went through the same precise thing the key in my opinion too high ticket affiliate marketing and high-pitched ticket auctions is connecting with the right people and when I say connecting I intend there’s something about you or your sense that reverberated with them because it’s very possible that these same beings Have received and discover the same offer You’re presenting to them exclusively somebody else.Did it previously? But maybe there simply wasn’t a connection there maybe that presenter just didn’t say what it was needed to be said to hit a nerve with that viewer or With that patron, perhaps because you were the one that presented it in your own unique way That got somebody to take action I don’t know how many times I’ve seen the same offer over but over again But when I ultimately buy into an render It’s because a person presenting it to me presented it in a manner that fixed sense For me to go ahead and make that action. So don’t be afraid of meridian ticket sales Anybody can do this now. I use YouTube as a scaffold to promote my affiliate produces and I currently have about 3,600 readers Which forms my channel not a big channel at all, but you are able to say as a beginner starting out Hey, I want to do YouTube as well.But I have zero readers so your 3,600 readers gives you a huge advantage over mortal like me who has zero subscribers and of course when you have observers and parties that are warmed up to you and want to subscribe to your path because of how you present things and because of The content that you’re offering them and the quality that you give them then that is definitely considered heated commerce, but let’s compare myself with my 3,600 subscribers to somebody who has 250,000 customers do they have an advantage? Do they have an edge? well Of track they do but they’ve earned that advantage and they’ve earned that fringe by thriving their channel it took work to do that But I want to say this That I got my firstly my very first high-pitched ticket Commission which is over $ 1000 when my youtube path had less than 350 subscribers.So again, the one element that is so unique to each one of us is Actually us how I presented my volunteer the way I said it really made sense to an individual enough to where they opened up their pocketbook and expended tens of thousands of dollars for the produce and the offer that I was presenting to them which “ve given me” a very healthy gigantic Commission So the key in my opinion to ten extra business and to 10 x Your commission like it has done for me is to switch From low ticket offers to high ticket offers. I’m not saying to completely go away from cherished ticket furnishes I still have one or two low-toned ticket produces that I promote Because I promoted him from the very beginning and they still bring me some Commission’s every month but the only way I’ve been able to Skyrocket my business in to 10 durations the business that I was doing was with high ticket offerings And here’s the elegance of high ticket proposals. It makes the exact same amount of drive setup pour initiation autoresponder setup connect page initiation It takes all the same exact amount of work to set up a high ticket Product and an offering as it does a low-toned ticket render So doesn’t it represent more sense to go with the high-pitched ticket and besides high- pitched ticket presents have a builtin filtering system Not everybody’s interested in high ticket offers.Not everybody it wants to create and Ten or fifteen or twenty thousand dollars a month, but those are the people that will filter themselves out And yes, you will get more auctions with low-grade ticket presents but you’re going to need to sell 50 to a hundred of those low- pitched ticket proposals on a monthly basis to equal the commission of One or two high-pitched ticket marketings. So guys by switching over this one simple philosophy of promoting high-pitched ticket renders that has really Catapulted and scaled up my business for the last three months if you are interested in knowing the Program that has helped me germinate my business I am gonna leave a link down below in the description of this video Now retain high ticket volunteers and high-pitched ticket affiliate commerce isn’t for everybody. Like I said earlier there is still work involved Yes There is an investment involved But the potential return on that that asset is so much greater Than a low-grade to get produce with the exact same amount of direct So if you’re ready to be more efficient in your business and start acquiring real fund Not really a little of fund We’re talk about lifechanging money Then click on that link down below and check out the program because we are closing high-pitched ticket auctions every day Using a strategy that nobody else is doing and recollect chaps It’s time to invest in your business and it’s time to invest in yourself

El Tribunal Supremo (TS) ha resuelto que "no ha lugar" al recurso de casación interpuesto por la defensa de los miembros del grupo de WhatsApp La Manada Antonio Manuel Guerrero Escudero y Alfonso Jesús Cabezuelo, condenados a 15 años de prisión por un delito continuado de violación a una joven en los Sanfermines de 2016, contra la sentencia del Tribunal Superior de Justicia de Navarra (TSJN) que confirma la condena adicional a tres años y tres meses de prisión y 5.670 euros de multa impuesta a ambos por la Sección Segunda de la Audiencia de Navarra, por un delito contra la intimidad por los vídeos y fotografías que tomaron de la violación grupal objeto de su condena inicial. Así lo ha decidido el Supremo en una sentencia emitida el pasado 15 de diciembre con relación al ex guardia civil y el ex militar miembros del citado grupo de WhatsApp. En su recurso de casación, la defensa de Antonio Manuel Guerrero Escudero y Alfonso Jesús Cabezuelo esgrimía una presunta vulneración del derecho a un proceso con todas las garantías, señalando la "falta de denuncia por parte de la víctima" con relación a las imágenes de los hechos, pues el Código Penal "exige denuncia del agraviado para la persecución del delito" y la causa inicialmente seguida contra los mencionados miembros del grupo de WhatsApp La Manada, entre ellos Guerrero Escudero y Cabezuelo, "pretendía esclarecer la posible comisión de un delito de agresión sexual" por el que finalmente fueron condenados los cinco acusados y un delito contra la propiedad por la sustracción del teléfono móvil de la denunciante, pero "jamás" aludía a un supuesto delito contra la intimidad. La primera constancia que Guerrero Escudero y Cabezuelo tuvieron de la acusación contra ellos por un presunto delito contra la intimidad, según exponía la defensa de los mismos, fue en el escrito de conclusiones provisionales de la Fiscalía en el procedimiento correspondiente a los delitos de agresión sexual y contra la propiedad, extremo al que se sumaron las demás acusaciones. La decisión del TSJN sobre el delito contra la intimidad Recordemos que por aquellos hechos, los cinco procesados fueron condenados por la Audiencia de Navarra a nueve años de prisión por un delito continuado de abuso sexual con prevalimiento, extremo confirmado por el Tribunal Superior de Justicia de Navarra, que además ordenó a la Audiencia emitir una nueva sentencia exclusivamente en lo relativo al delito contra la intimidad; al no apreciar los obstáculos procesales invocados en la sentencia inicial y que habían motivado la absolución de los inculpados respecto a tal aspecto. Posteriormente, en julio de 2019, el Supremo revocó la condena inicial, condenando a todos los acusados a los citados 15 años por un delito continuado de agresión sexual y a dos años más a Guerrero Escudero por un delito de robo con intimidación del teléfono móvil de la víctima. Ya en noviembre de 2019, la Sección Segunda de la Audiencia emitió su nueva sentencia respecto al delito contra la intimidad, condenando a Guerrero Escudero y Cabezuelo por dicho delito y absolviendo del mismo a los restantes tres acusados. En ese sentido, y con relación al recurso de casación de la defensa de Guerrero Escudero y Cabezuelo, el Supremo recuerda que el TSJN, en su citada sentencia, estimó parcialmente un recurso de las acusaciones y rechazó "la línea argumental de la Audiencia, que había absuelto de un delito contra la intimidad al estimar que no constaba un presupuesto de persiguibilidad en forma de denuncia por parte de la víctima". A tal efecto, el Supremo sostiene que la "nueva deliberación" de la Audiencia con relación al delito contra la intimidad derivada de la decisión del TSJN ha permitido a los acusados "reforzar sus posibilidades alegatorias mediante sendos recursos de apelación y casación centrados exclusivamente en ese delito". En paralelo, y respecto a la falta de denuncia por parte de la víctima con relación al delito contra la intimidad, el Supremo determina que "lo decisivo es que la víctima exteriorice la voluntad de activar el tratamiento jurisdiccional de la ofensa sufrida", lo que lleva al tribunal a señalar que en este caso, "ha promovido en las distintas instancias la acusación" relacionada al delito contra la intimidad.
