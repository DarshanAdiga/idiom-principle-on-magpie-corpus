The USDJPY is higher on the day, basing near the 100 hour MA in early illiquid trading, moving above the 200 hour MA shortly there after. The pair was able to base near that MA and make the run toward the 50% retracement and above at 104.88. The high stalled at 104.944 before stalling and moving back down.The pair is now back retesting the 200 hour MA at 104.6154. That is a borderline that traders will look to lean against. I would expect disappointment and some liquidation of longs on a move below the 200 hour MA. Stay above and the buyers/longs hold control.For this week, the uncertainty from the election, Brexit, Covid, etc will have traders on edge and subject to the headlines, speculation, tweets, etc. Technicals become a thing to lean on to give a bias from "the market". "The market" is the collection of all traders who decide the price should be here. That bias can change by using tools used by many, that are unambiguous and define risk. Trend lines, moving averages (100 and 200 bar for me) and retracements, help to do that. Make that a choice for you if you choose to trade through the haze and uncertainty from the events.

“Desde 1988 soy profesor de escultura. Obtuve la plaza de profesor titular en 1995. Ha sido un recorrido apasionante de formación e investigación dentro y fuera de la propia universidad, y tengo que decir que la universidad que he visto y en la que me he formado nada tiene que ver con la actual, cuyo balance es bastante desalentador desde el punto de vista académico y administrativo, al menos desde la imposición del Plan Bolonia. Durante mis estudios viví los mejores momentos de una Facultad de Bellas Artes con todos sus problemas y debilidades. A día de hoy la universidad se ahoga en su propia burocracia. No conozco a un profesor que se encuentre a gusto en el actual sistema de enseñanza, en el que, además de su formación, investigación y docencia, tiene que atender a todo un lastre de labores administrativas, reuniones, comisiones, evaluaciones… Buena parte del profesorado se ha convertido en un burócrata administrativo cuya labor investigadora (en nuestro caso, artística) es prácticamente escasa o nula. ¿Cómo es posible que un alto número de profesores, funcionarios o no, se haya prejubilado o quiera jubilarse lo antes posible?, cuando impartir docencia en la universidad es y debería ser todo un lujo. Algo está ocurriendo, ¿verdad?. Respecto al nuevo edificio, creo que ha sido bastante desafortunado. Se ha dado prioridad a la estética frente a la funcionalidad. Desde el punto de vista arquitectónico, entendiendo la arquitectura como una estrecha relación entre forma y función, deja mucho que desear. El informe elaborado por la propia universidad es demoledor, un edificio que no reúne condiciones de habitabilidad. En los talleres la falta de ventilación y el calor es insoportable. En los despachos de los profesores hay que conectar estufas y ventiladores porque la humedad, el frío y el calor producen verdaderos problemas de salud. No digamos los costes económicos que produce este edificio, que no ha dejado de recibir intervenciones desde su ocupación”.

On the face of it, that looks good but Monday data can be deceiving.A better comparison in prior Monday and on that front we can see it certainly is good news. Cases then were 20,900. This is in fitting with a bit of a plateau in new UK cases if not a turn lower as a result of voluntary and non-voluntary curbs.It begs the question?

responsible for the survey of small and medium companies. Both PMIs are diffusion indexes measuring growth month over month with readings over 50 showing growth and readings under 50 indicating contraction. The manufacturing PMI showed strength across the board as output continued to grow along with new orders in both exports and imports while inventories shrank. The non- manufacturing PMI also saw new orders increase though new export orders did contract. Business expectations were very strong in both PMIs. The Caixin Manufacturing PMI was driven by stronger output and new orders while the rate of growth for exports did slow. IHS noted that exports continue to be affected by the economic consequence of global quarantines. That being said, business expectations did rise to the highest level since August 2014. Summing it up, the readings are further evidence that China’s economy is experiencing a V-shaped recovery.

The good is private residential construction rose smartly by 2.8%. For public spending, the purse strings from local and state governments from the impact of Covid will put a damper on spending. Of course there was once talk about infrastructure spending. That idea has been put on the back burner.For bank trade ideas, check out eFX Plus

So maybe you really are broke landlords. In that case, a suggestion -- some more free advice: sell us the building and we'll take care of it. Or, on second thought, we've already paid enough rent to you to build this building all over again many times, so you can just cut your losses, declare bankruptcy, and we can buy it from the foreclosure corporations, where you buy your distressed properties, that you then turn around and gouge us to live in.
