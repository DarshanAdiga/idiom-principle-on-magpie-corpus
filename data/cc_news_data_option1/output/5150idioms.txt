Unidentified police officials told _The Indian Express_ that Khanchandani’s role in the scam was identified during the interrogation of the channel’s distribution head, Ghanshyam Singh. They said that Khanchandani was allegedly part of a WhatsApp group that the channel used to discuss and plan the manipulation of its Logical Channel Number, or LCN.
 An LCN is an identification number assigned to a television channel, which viewer’s press on their remotes to access the different available services. The Mumbai Police alleged that the Republic TV allegedly used a dual LCN, which allowed it to show up in the “kids channels” section along with the “news channels” category.
 Investigators claimed that Khanchandani knew about these alleged LCN manipulations. The Special Investigation Team of the Mumbai Police had told court that it wished to interrogate Khanchandani to understand the alleged payments made by Republic TV to multi-system and cable operators to boost its viewership ratings.
 A fake TRP racket was uncovered in October when the Broadcast Audience Research Council filed a complaint through Hansa Research Group – one of BARC’s vendors on engagement with panel homes, or “people’s meters”. Some of the channels were accused of rigging their TRPs by bribing some households to watch it.
 Several Republic TV officials have been questioned in the matter. Apart from Republic TV, Box Cinema and Marathi channel Fakt Marathi were the others named during the preliminary investigation.
 On December 9, Republic TV Editor-in-Chief Goswami had moved the Bombay High Court seeking a stay on the Mumbai Police’s investigations into the scam. The petition, filed by Goswami and ARG Outlier Media, which owns Republic TV, alleged that Ghanshyam Singh was subjected to custodial torture following his arrest on November 10. A day later, the channel had also moved the National Human Rights Commission against the alleged torture of Singh.

In Los Angeles and elsewhere in the Golden State, a sense of anger with seemingly contradictory lockdown orders is growing along with virus cases, which are reaching new records across the state. It’s a major reversal of fate for the first U.S. state to impose a lockdown in March, a move hailed as a success that kept the state from experiencing a surge of infections and death like what happened in New York. Following the spring shutdown, California reopened in June — only to enforce new restrictions in July. Now with the state’s ICU beds maxed out, Governor Gavin Newsom has imposed a stay-at-home order. While other states have similarly seen infighting, often at the hands of mask skeptics, the latest round of orders from state and local governments are driving a lot of Californians who might otherwise not have strong views on public health politics to question whether their leaders are making good – and fair – decisions. Protests against lockdowns have erupted outside public health officials’ homes and an effort to oust Newsom is strengthening, with half of the 1.5 million petition signatures to put a recall on the ballot already gathered.

Batting great Javed Miandad does not believe that the absence of captain Babar Azam due to injury should affect Pakistan’s chances of doing well in the upcoming T20 International series in New Zealand.
 The 26-year-old Azam, captain in all three formats, has been ruled out of the T20I series beginning on Friday in Auckland after suffering a thumb fracture during a practice session.
 “This is sports and life goes on. Even if a great is missing in a team, others have to step up and take responsibility. It should not be an excuse for not performing well,” Miandad said in an interview.
 “Imran Khan or Javed Miandad did not win the 1992 World Cup for Pakistan single-handedly, it was a collective team effort that brought us that glory,” said the former captain.
 Miandad, who played 124 Tests between 1976 and 1993, said obviously when a top batsman is not available it does make a difference but how other players respond to the challenge will show the character of the team.
 “Babar’s absence should not haunt the team. No doubt, he is our best player at the moment but the team should not come under pressure as there are 11 players in the team who should stand up and be counted in the coming series,” he said.
 Miandad said New Zealand will not be an easy side because “they have improved a lot in recent years as a team”.
 “They have always been difficult to beat at home. But we also have some good players who should collectively get together and give their best.
 “I think we can win the series if the selected players play fearless and sensible cricket and don’t come under pressure.”

PARIS, Dec 15 (Reuters) - French schoolchildren will be allowed to skip classes and stay at home on Thursday and Friday if their families wish to self-isolate ahead of Christmas, Prime Minister Jean Castex said on Tuesday.


  The medical council advising the government on COVID-19 said on Monday that families who planned to host people vulnerable to the coronavirus, such as elderly relatives, should quarantine for a week beforehand if possible.


  Schools should not punish pupils who missed the last two days of the academic term, the council added.


  Asked if he supported the recommendation, Castex told Europe 1 radio: "Of course."


  Governments across Europe are grappling with how to contain a powerful second wave of the virus just as families yearn to gather over the festive period.


  France is delaying the reopening of theatres, museums and cinemas and re- imposing a nightly curfew from Tuesday, while the Netherlands is going into a tough second lockdown and Germany is shutting down non-essential shops from Wednesday.

The way the team will work each year will be 24 of the best players, by position, and then a team captain. The captain can be any position, and the honor will go to a true leader, a player worthy of the captain title.


  This year the captain spot goes to the ultimate leader Timmy Ward of Canton.


  There is no player who has overcome more in their career than Ward. Two years ago Ward was an all-state player, and right after the season he was diagnosed with cancer. Last year he sat out coming back from his recovery after cancer.


  This year he was ready to make his NTL return, only to tear his ACL in a scrimmage.


  Instead of getting don, Ward showed what kind of leader he was. He started the opener, playing with a torn ACL. And, when his season ended, he kept leading the Warriors doing anything from helping to bring players water, to helping coach and providing inspiration for all his teammates.


  There is no more fitting leader for a team than Timmy Ward.

Rivera has not yet announced his plan to transition out of his role as mayor and into his new position with MassDevelopment. He plans to update the community and the council during Tuesday night's meeting, which is streamed live on the Lawrence City Council Facebook page starting at 7 p.m.


  Rivera was appointed to the state agency Thursday to replace Lauren Liss.


  MassDevelopment is a state finance agency that works with businesses, nonprofits, banks and communities to create jobs, increase housing and stimulate growth in a variety of ways. Those methods include building infrastructure and helping to finance projects.


  To bypass a special election, councilors must agree to file a home rule petition that gets passed on by Lawrence's state delegation to Gov. Charlie Baker, who must sign it into law. According to Payano, if that happens and there is no special election, the council president would remain acting mayor until the next scheduled regular election.


  "I'm of the mindset that those proposing this (bypassing a special election) think they're doing something good for the city. Out in the public right now, people are talking about the fact that (others) are trying to get rid of their opportunity to vote," said Payano, who is chairman of the Charter Committee.


  Payano said the Charter Committee has spent nearly a year poring over possible changes to the city's guiding document, and that omission of a special election for mayor was not mentioned, despite previously unconfirmed rumblings that Rivera might not finish his term.


  "This is not changing the charter; it's just waiving it for this moment, which I don't think is right," Payano said of eliminating the special election in the wake of Rivera's departure. "It seems sketchy."


  Payano said the city's surplus account contains $15 million to cover election costs. In terms of health and safety, he pointed to the two previous elections Lawrence held during the pandemic in September and November without incident.


  "We held two elections and everyone left feeling safe," he said, adding the success was largely due to city employees and poll workers who facilitated the elections. "If we've done this before, I don't see COVID as being the reason not to do it. I have faith that the interim city clerk (Richard Reyes) has the ability to organize the special election. We could also ask Secretary (of State William) Galvin for help.


  "There are solutions to these problems," Payano said. "When we talk about getting rid of an election, the reasons for doing so must be so out of this world to have to take it away for the voters ... especially since elections are so fundamental for the growth of democracy."

At the end of CES week, Samsung is expected to hold its first Unpacked of 2021, about a month earlier than the company's normal timin. Samsung likely will show off the Galaxy S21, going up against Apple's iPhone 12 lineup and giving Android buyers something new to covet earlier than usual. The Galaxy S21 Ultra is expected to come with five camera lenses and a stylus, possibly killing off Samsung's popular Note lineup.


  ## Cheaper devices


  The first smartphones to hit the market with 5G were pricey, like Samsung's $1,300 Galaxy S10 5G. They often commanded a steep premium over their 4G variants and also required premium service plans. But prices for 5G phones have fallen quickly over the past several months as the coronavirus dampened consumer spending and the carriers tried to expand 5G's reach.


  Many handset makers have introduced mainstream devices alongside or shortly after pricier flagship models. Premium models, like Samsung's Galaxy S20 lineup, have seen steep discounts. And Apple even kept the price of its iPhone 12 Pro lineup steady with last year's phones, even though the new models all have 5G connectivity.


  2021 should bring more inexpensive smartphones. While 5G is expected to be a game-changer, for many consumers right now, it's just an extra cost. The introduction of cheaper devices can help change that. Not only will handset makers introduce less expensive new devices, 2020's crop of 5G phones likely will stick around at lower prices.

One way to look at the data is to overlay the image of the precise track the boat took back and forth on the water on a satellite map. “This is a tremendous help because, once a target is found, we are able to pull the GPS coordinates for the exact location for the boat to mark and divers to dive to check the possible target,” said Cotton.


  Recovering a body from murky waters is an unpleasant task, to say the least, but the advanced technology reduces the risks to divers by giving them a more direct approach and also the wait time for loved ones.


  Malecki’s body was recovered on the second day of the search in about 60 feet of water, but not before the dive teams analyzed a variety of images produced by the sonar equipment, including a submerged, contorted log that initially looked like a body.


  “You’re not actually going to see a person. It’s more of a shadow,” Cotton noted. There is a lot of “seat time,” he said of the process of learning what to look for. “It’s how you interpret the information.”


  In the past two years, two vehicles have plunged into the Susquehanna River at Athens, resulting in the drowning of the occupants of one of the vehicles. The river was high and muddy, and the search for the vehicle with the use of poles, grappling hooks, and intuition was tedious and time consuming. The new equipment would certainly have made the fire department’s work easier, Cotton maintained.


  This past summer and fall, the river has been extremely low, so the dive team at Athens has not had as many opportunities for practicing with the new sonar equipment as had been planned. In the meantime, crew members can learn virtually by reviewing and analyzing data recorded from missions conducted by others on YouTube and several social media groups. “We expect six to eight members to have a really good handle on running it,” Cotton stated.


  In an email to Williams after the Elk Lake mission, Cotton remarked, “This goes to show that your donation didn’t just help our county and local fire departments but also many neighboring counties to our north, south, east and west. This is a huge asset to have located here for future needs.”


  Fire department chief Jason Chandler agrees that the Athens Borough Water Rescue Team will likely be called on more often, even from neighboring New York state, now that word is getting out that they have the equipment.

"[Online gambling] has increased. People are left to their own devices during the lockdown, and many people have been engaging in technology and different things that they never did before to pass the time of day," said Arlene Simon, Executive Director of the Delaware Council on Gambling Problems. "So there has been an explosion in popularity of online gaming and gambling."
 It's even more problematic for a generation raised among a digital landscape.
 "Particularly among the younger folk and the millennials, these are people who really know how to access online activities, and are more comfortable doing things online, than they are going into, say, a casino or a poker game or something of that nature," she said. "And so we are finding a lot in the younger age groups that are having this problem."
 Simon said the internet has made it easier than ever for addicts to find their fix, while maximizing what makes the addiction so appealing to reel the vulnerable in even further.
 "The speed of it; for somebody who is interested in gambling, speed is a strong factor. They don't have to wait to get resolved," she said to Peter MacArthur on WDEL's DelAWARE. "Online gambling is very quick. It's the same reason people buy scratch-off tickets, because they get an instantaneous result. And with online gaming, it's so easy. If you have a credit card or a debit card, you use that and you don't even think about how much money you're spending or how much you're putting on there, oftentimes until it's too late."
 That means every win--and even more frequently, every loss--will provide that dopamine hit even more quickly, which is what those addicted to gambling are chasing.

  Dec 15 (Reuters) - A day after the Electoral College confirmed his presidential victory, Joe Biden will travel to Georgia on Tuesday to campaign for two Democratic U.S. Senate candidates whose Jan. 5 runoff elections could make or break his domestic policy agenda.


  Biden's narrow win in the Southern state in November's presidential election completed its transformation from Republican stronghold to one of the country's most competitive political battlegrounds.


  Republican Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler are facing Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, respectively, in twin races that will determine which party controls the U.S. Senate when Biden takes office on Jan. 20.


  If the Republicans win either contest, they would maintain power in the Senate, allowing them to thwart many of Biden's ambitious legislative goals on issues such as the coronavirus, the economy and climate change. A Democratic sweep would give the party control of the White House and Congress, where it also has a majority in the U.S. House of Representatives.


  Biden's trip to Atlanta comes nine days after President Donald Trump traveled to Georgia in support of Perdue and Loeffler. The president-elect's visit also coincides with early in-person voting, which began on Monday as hundreds of Georgians braved rainy weather to stand in line.


  As in November, many voters are expected to cast ballots by mail amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Thus far, more than 1.2 million residents have requested absentee ballots, and more than 260,000 have already sent them in, according to the U.S. Elections Project at the University of Florida.


  Biden's win has boosted Democratic hopes of capturing both seats, along with aggressive efforts to register voters and changing demographics that have pushed the electorate away from Republicans.


  Perdue ran ahead of Trump in the Nov. 3 election, however, finishing ahead of Ossoff but just shy of the 50% required to avoid a runoff under state law. A third-party candidate received about 2% of the vote.


  The other race had a large field of candidates in November due to its status as a special election because Loeffler was appointed to her seat to fill a vacancy. Warnock and Loeffler finished in the top two positions, each well short of 50%.


  TURNOUT ISSUES


  Hundreds of millions of dollars have poured into the state from both political parties as well as an array of outside political groups.


  Both sides face turnout challenges in the midst of the pandemic and without the polarizing Trump at the top of the ballot to turn out votes from his deeply loyal supporters and also from detractors with deep animosity toward him.


  Some Republicans in the state have expressed concern that Trump's repeated insistence, without evidence, that the November results were fraudulent may drive down turnout among his most ardent supporters.


  Biden secured the presidency on Monday after the Electoral College formalized his win. Under U.S. law, the president is not elected by a majority of the popular vote but by the Electoral College, which awards electoral votes to the winner of each state based on congressional representation.

  Arsenal's cause against Burnley at the weekend was not helped by the dismissal of midfielder Granit Xhaka.


  The Switzerland international was initially booked for a foul on Dwight McNeil by referee Graham Scott, who was then advised by VAR to review footage of the skirmish that broke out following the challenge.


  Having seen the 28-year-old grab Ashley Westwood around the neck, Scott upgraded the card to red.


  The dismissal was the sixth in the Premier League for Arsenal since Arteta was appointed, double the number of any other top-flight team across the same period.


  As for Xhaka, it was his third red card for Arsenal; only four other players have been sent off more times for the north London club during the Premier League era.


  Arteta explained Xhaka's "mistake" had been dealt with behind closed doors.


  "It has been resolved internally," he said.


  "Players have rocky moments. What I would say about him is that he is professional and his commitment to his club and team-mates is maximum.


  "He knows and we all know that he had a moment where he lost it. I know the reason why but I can't throw everything he has done away because he made a mistake. We all make them.


  "I am here to protect the players when I see that they deserve it. For sure, Granit is one of them for the way he approaches every training session, the way he wants to do things the right way all the time and because of the professional he is."

There are complaints in several communities in the state that the Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi-led government of Enugu State has brazenly deployed land grabbing as a weapon to economically suppress the citizens. It deliberately and forcefully possesses community lands citing overriding public interest only to convert them in the end to private businesses. There are reports that there is a dedicated bank account where the proceeds from the sales of these fraudulently acquired lands are lodged into. For instance, as soon as they are forcefully taken over the government does the layout, demarcates them and begins to dispose them. Since his coming, there has not been a single housing estate to the credit of the present administration in the state. This practice has seemingly portrayed it as the most insensitive government since 1999. For any keen observer on ground since 2015 there have been seasons of forceful takeover of lands in communities predominantly in the Nkanu area of the state which otherwise is the Enugu-East senatorial zone. In most cases, the government induces crisis with a view to causing divisions among the people so as to have a smooth sail.

When defenceless farmers are set upon – what does it matter if it is fifty or a hundred? – are butchered in one fell swoop, harvesting their crop, does the sheer suggestion that they met their deaths because they did not seek military cover not speak to the parlous state of a nation, and her need to urgently “think outside the box”?

"That's just one way with the holidays on top of the pandemic on top of kids and school that has helped me lighten up. It took us about 12 years to accrue our children. I went through a long battle with infertility and then I finally had my son who is 13 now. Then we adopted our daughter from Ethiopia when she was two and then we adopted our oldest daughter from Latvia. We have three kids from three continents that were out of order and we've had a lot to learn to calm down about."

This revelation came to me after reading the most recent assessment, caution and recommendation pack from the Government Accountability Office, and talking with its principal author Chris Mihm. Come to think of it, that might be a good name for the scores of studies the GAO puts out every year — ACRPs. Mihm, GAO's director for strategic issues, is one of those people who reviews endless federal program shortfalls, fails, and near misses, and yet remains cheerfully optimistic.

The benefits of this work are endless. The horse will be more bridle savvy, and when it’s time to mount you will have established a familiar “hand to mouth” feel that they rely on instead of retracting from. Also, longe lining behind the horse eliminates the visual dependency horses get from a person being beside or near the vision zone. This helps them rely on the feeling of the hand without being able to see the motion of the hand. Longe lining before you ride will prepare them for the aids. You have an opportunity to see how much warmup they need on any given day. If they’re fresh or explosive you have a chance to correct them in the moment. It is also a time to evaluate lameness by watching the footfalls.
