As the pandemic wears on, Clermont-Minneola Lions Club members gratefully accepted Micki Blackburn Nagel’s offer to hold their club meeting Oct. 8 in her office’s conference room, located on SR 50, until they can meet in the social hall of St. Matthais Episcopal Church in downtown Clermont.
 Special guest speaker Jaylana Kraemer, mother of twins (one hearing impaired) shared information about her program CLEAR TO HEAR PPE. She works with special needs children who are hearing impaired.
 “Imagine teachers trying to teach deaf children while wearing a regular mask – does not work,” the club said.
 After long and tedious efforts to find some form of personal protection equipment (PPE) that is reasonably affordable, Kraemer found an inventor in Juno, Alaska, who could help. The Lake County School Board is on board with her; however, funding is a problem. With 98 hearing impaired children in Lake County Schools, the task of raising funds has been a challenge. A number of the children have no resources to afford one, so Kraemer created a Go Fund Me account. For information, contact her at 530-559-7694.

Despite the long-awaited news that allowed New York State movie theaters to reopen, anxious movie-goers still find themselves resigned to virtual cinema screenings.
 Movie theaters in New York State remained closed due to COVID-19 regulations, but after facing mounting pressure from theaters across the state, Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D-N.Y.) announced Oct. 17 a reopening plan for these businesses. Theaters were officially allowed to reopen Oct. 23, but the doors to many in Tompkins County remain closed.
 According to the plan released by Cuomo, theaters can operate at 25 percent capacity with no more than 50 patrons allowed on an individual screen at once. The state is only permitting theaters to reopen in counties with COVID-19 rates less than 2 percent on a 14-day rolling average.
 Unlike many surrounding counties , New York State gave Tompkins County the go- ahead to reopen its theaters, but there are other requirements, such as the mandated installation of MERV-13 air filters, that have impeded meeting the Oct. 23 reopening date.
 The required MERV-13 filters are the heaviest constraint on theater reopenings, according to Brett Bossard, the executive director of Cinemapolis Ithaca. Other businesses that were allowed to open before theaters were similarly required to enhance their air filtration systems, causing MERV-13 filters to be in short supply.
 Considering the close time proximity between the governor’s announcement and the reopening date, theaters also lacked adequate time and information to make preparations that conform with the guidelines, Bossard said.
 “We were sort of left completely in the dark,” Bossard said. “There has been a lot of frustration among theater owners and operators… because [the state] was providing no guidelines, no benchmarks, [no] roadmap to reopen, and it was impossible for us to make any preparations.”
 Theaters have fought for New York to lift these restrictions for a while. About a month ago, Cinemapolis joined forces with about 20 independent theaters in the state to write a letter to Cuomo, channeling their frustration and imploring him to provide a roadmap. He faced mounting pressure from corporate theaters, too. In Times Square, the Regal E-Walk marquee read "48 states have reopened theaters so far. Why not New York, Gov. Cuomo? #ReopenOurCinemasNY."
 “I think it was very strange to say the least that our sector was left out,” Bossard said. “Casinos, which I consider a very high-risk environment, could be operating at a 25 percent capacity. It was frustrating that movie theaters were not given, at the very least, a similar list of restrictions to start planning our operations.”
 As an independent theater, Cinemapolis has been able to pivot its business model during the pandemic in order to fulfill its mission to “provide its patrons with access to the best film has to offer,” Bossard said. The theater has tried to fulfill its mission by creating a virtual cinema, where patrons can purchase tickets for screenings to watch at home. While the virtual cinema is not the same as seeing a move in-person, Bossard said the initiative has been met with great success and enthusiasm.
 “[The virtual cinema] is certainly going nowhere. It's going to be in our toolbox for quite some time,” Bossard said. “It will certainly continue for the next couple of years. We're going to have patrons who are not going to want to return immediately to a cinema even with the capacity restrictions and everything else, so we want to make sure that we're still serving those patrons.”
 The impact of the pandemic has been especially severe for commercial movie theaters who lack the same flexibility as independent theaters to drastically adapt their business models. Regal Cinemas’ owner Cineworld, the second largest theater chain in the nation, reported an operating loss of $1.34 billion for this year.
 Earlier in October, Cineworld shut down all 536 Regal Cinema locations across the country. Upon receiving the reopening news from Cuomo, however, the company announced plans to reopen 11 theaters across New York. But the Regal Cinemas at the Shops at Ithaca Mall is not one of these theaters, and it remains closed indefinitely.
 Beyond adherence to strict health guidelines, a problem unique to commercial theaters is that there are not many new movies for them to show. Commercial theaters are reliant on Hollywood production, and the pandemic has disrupted the production of commercial films.
 “For a lot of larger commercial theaters, it’s a bigger concern that there just aren't movies to show to the degree that would attract enough audience to make it worthwhile to operate,” Bossard said.
 Like Cinemapolis, Cornell Cinema has also been able to adapt its operations to a virtual screening model during the pandemic, a model Cornell Cinema anticipates will carry it through the spring semester, as Cornell has not announced any alterations to its in-person event guidance for the spring..
 Even if the University relaxed its guidance in the near future, Cornell Cinema manager Douglas McLaren said the theater would most likely remain closed to in-person screenings for most of the spring semester due to the costs and preparations associated with reopening. Some of these preparations include rehiring and training student staff, booking and shipping films for theatrical exhibition and sanitizing the theater space and equipment.
 Even though the physical theater remains closed, McLaren said that Cornell Cinema’s virtual screenings have been met with great success. By offering a majority of its films for free, Cornell’s virtual cinema diverges from other virtual models. Furthermore, through its virtual model, the cinema has been able to host online programs beyond films for its patrons, such as filmmaker talks.
 “We've had great engagement with undergrads, graduate students [and] community members,” McLaren said. “This has also been really nice, because although Cornell has remained closed to outside visitors, folks are still able to engage with us virtually.”
 Cornell Cinema has relied on multiple funding streams to subsidize the cost of its screenings. In addition to receiving funding from the Graduate Student Assembly, the theater supports itself with grants from New York State, the Cornell Council for the Arts and the Performing and Media Arts department.
 McLaren expressed gratitude to the University for its support through the pandemic, adding that he respects its decision to prolong the pause on in- person screenings.
 But it is still unclear what the future holds for Tompkins County theaters. Nevertheless, McLaren and Bossard agreed that the pandemic has generated new opportunities to engage with broader audiences and experiment with novel cinematic approaches that could lead to long-term benefits.
 “Theaters are in the lemonade business now,” Bossard said. “We have been handed a bushel of lemons and we are doing our best to make lemonade.”

Some foods can be kept at room temperature for a few days, including butter or margarine, fruit juices, jelly, relish, ketchup, barbecue sauce, pickles, baked goods, hard cheeses and processed cheeses.
 A good way to know the temperature of foods is to keep an appliance thermometer in both the refrigerator and the freezer. In the event of a power outage, consumers will know if the temperature in the refrigerator or freezer drops below a safe level after a few hours.
 “If your freezer is not full when the power fails, quickly group packages of food together so they can help keep each other cold,” she said. “When you do that, be sure to separate meat and poultry so they are below other foods. That way, if they begin to thaw, their juices won’t drip onto ready-to-eat foods.”
 Brown recommends keeping your freezer full to maximize storage. If you routinely have empty space in the freezer, fill clean juice bottles or milk containers with water and store them in the freezer. These blocks of ice can buy a person several extra hours of cold storage in the event of a power outage.
 “It’s much better to be safe than sorry when it comes to salvaging food items following a weather emergency,” Brown said. “In most cases, the power is usually restored within a few hours. However, if the outage lasts several days, be prepared to toss everything. The best rule of thumb is ‘when in doubt, throw it out.’”
 For additional food safety information, please contact your local OSU Cooperative Extension county office.

In a first of its kind in Tamil Nadu, Debt Recovery Tribunal – II, Chennai has admitted an insolvency petition against a personal guarantor Rohit Nath in a case filed by KEB Hana Bank.
 Mr. Nath had given personal guarantee on loans availed by Alectrona Energy Private Limited.
 The law on initiating insolvency proceedings against personal guarantors was notified on December 1, 2019 and according to experts the current development should come as a wakeup call for promoters and personal guarantors.
 “Conventionally, in India, promoters and their family members, relatives, associates act as “Personal Guarantors” for debts borrowed by the Company from lenders/financial institutions. This is even more common in small and mid- sized Companies which were already in the red and now burdened with the pandemic effect,” Anant Merathia, a Chennai-based corporate lawyer said.
 “With changing times and legal frameworks, this is a serious aspect that Indian promoters/guarantors must factor in both for the ongoing personal guarantees issued vis-à-vis defaults and performance of their companies and ones they propose to give for further funding. They should think twice before involving family members as personal guarantors,” Mr Merathia pointed out.
 Experts are of the view that the personal insolvency process under Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 is likely to have strict timelines to be followed, unlike earlier regimes.
 Another interesting aspect to wait and watch is the outcome of the litigation challenging the constitutional validity of Provisions of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 with respect to personal guarantors.
 The provisions are challenged before the High Court in the matter of Anil Ambani vs State Bank of India, which is still pending. The Court has stayed the proceedings. Mr Merathia reckoned that eventually a decision by the Supreme Court on the issue would set a solid footing for the law in this regard.

 Blake Snell turned away from his manager and yelled an expletive as Kevin Cash headed to the mound. In control all night, the Tampa Bay ace no longer had the ball in his potent left hand.
 Soon, the Rays no longer had a grip on the lead, either.
 The team that reached the World Series leaning largely on analytics was undone by the data -- and a decision sure to become part of October lore.
 With Snell still seething, wobbly reliever Nick Anderson was on the mound when Mookie Betts' double started a sequence that led to two quick runs as the Los Angeles Dodgers rallied for a championship-clinching 3-1 victory in Game 6 on Tuesday night.
 "I guess I regret it because it didn't work out," Cash said, later adding, "personally, I thought Blake had done his job and then some."

“I didn’t see the ball,” Agustin Garcia said. “I was looking the other way (at Kline’s pass), and when I turned around, I saw it. There were two guys on me, so I didn’t think I would get it. It was nice.”
 The first goal opened things up to back-and-forth action, with each team looking for openings. Williamsport made the better breaks.
 “Williamsport came out and played the way they play,” Galvan said. “They take advantage of mistakes and make you pay. They outworked us and got all the 50-50 balls and second-chance balls.”
 Still, North was able to tie the game in the 30th minute when Nathan Fazal was fouled in the box and awarded a penalty kick. The junior midfielder-forward booted the ball to the right — while Wildcats goalkeeper Andrew Downs made a dive to the left — to knot the game before halftime.
 The teams came out of the break and continued to try and find openings.
 After the first 10 minutes of the second half, Williamsport started going over the top of North. The Wildcats used Andrew Downs’ goal kicks and speed moves down the sidelines to push the ball into the offensive end.
 Williamsport finally found an opening when Matthew Ribis got control about 30 yards to the right of the goal. He fired the ball into an opening in the box, where Agustin Garcia zipped down the middle.
 “That was a good ball from MJ,” Chris Downs said. “All the freshmen we played tonight played well and contributed.”
 Agustin Garcia caught the ball in stride and fired it in with a one-touch finish from 10 yards out.
 “I just ran up and the ball was there,” he said. “I knew this was going to be a hard game. I gave it all of my best.”
 North had a few long chances in the later stages of the game, but most flew over the net. Overall, shots were limited as North finished with 11 to Williamsport's seven.
 Andrew Downs made five saves for the Wildcats.
 “It was back and forth,” Galvin said. “They capitalized on two mistakes. When you get into that situation, that’s what happens.”

 "So who gets to pull the manager?" Syndergaard tweeted.
 "You manage a baseball game with your EYES, HEART, & GUT as well as your BRAIN," Blevins posted.
 Some older sluggers weighed in as well, such as Hall of Famer Frank Thomas.
 "Another Analytical Meltdown!! Total Disaster for Tampa," Thomas wrote. "Blake Snell was your only chance of winning a tight game tonight."
 Why pull your best pitcher with a reasonable pitch count, nine strikeouts and just two hits simply because it's about to be the third time through the order?
 "I'm not exactly sure why. I'm not going to ask any questions, but he was pitching a great game," Betts said.
 "It was kind of like a sigh of relief," Betts said. "Had he stayed in the game, he might have pitched a complete game. It was the Cy Young Snell that pitched tonight."
 Count Dodgers manager Dave Roberts, himself a frequent target for criticism over pulling starters, among those happy to see Snell go.
 "Mookie looked at me with a little smile, and we were all just excited that Snell was out of the game," Roberts said.
 Barnes, the No. 9 hitter, singled on Snell's 73rd pitch with one out in the sixth when Cash made the same decision he has so many times in the fifth or sixth inning.
 The sixth-year skipper turned it over to a bullpen that set a major league record with 12 different pitchers recording saves, despite just a 60-game schedule reduced by the pandemic.
 Anderson was the best of them all in the regular season, allowing five hits and one earned run in 16 1/3 innings over 19 outings. But the tall right- hander -- who came from Miami at the trading deadline last year in one of several shrewd deals that made the Rays who they are -- has been ordinary in the postseason.
 Anderson allowed a run in his seventh consecutive appearance going back to Game 5 of the AL Division Series, a 2-1 win over the Yankees that sent Tampa Bay to the ALCS.
 "I thought it was Blake's game to lose," Rays center fielder Kevin Kiermaier said. "I had a great seat in center field in watching how he was striking everybody out. He had everything going. It was an unfortunate way to see it end.
 "Kevin Cash, our front office, they put together a certain game plan and they've been right time and time again. We did what we did and it didn't work out," he said.
 After the double by Betts down the line in left, Barnes scored on a wild pitch by Anderson that also sent Betts to third. Seager hit a grounder to Ji-Man Choi playing in at first base, but Betts made the instinctive play and took off for home, beating the throw with a head-first slide.
 "The way Cash manages and does his thing, it got us here," Anderson said. "Try to be as ready as possible when my name is called. I'll take the heat for not holding my end on this kind of playoff stretch."
 Betts hit a solo homer off Pete Fairbanks in the eighth inning to give a LA a little breathing room, and the Rays only had one more baserunner -- No. 9 hitter Mike Zunino's single in the seventh -- after Cash's fateful move.
 "I feel like the thought process was right. Every decision's that made, that end result has a pretty weighing factor in how you feel about it," Cash said.

Edison spokesman Chris Abel said wind speeds in the mountains above the city of Irvine at the time had not reached the threshold to pull the plug on the power, though they did later in the morning when some electric circuits were cut.
 “It’s not something that we take lightly,” Abel said of the decision to shut off electricity. “We know that not having power is a tremendous burden on our customers.”
 The Silverado Fire broke out in gusty weather just before 7 a.m. Monday near Irvine, a city of 280,000 about 35 miles (56 kilometers) south of Los Angeles. According to SoCal Edison’s report to state utility regulators, a “lashing wire” that ties a telecommunications line to a supporting cable may have come into contact with a separate 12,000-volt Edison conductor line above.
 That blaze and the Blue Ridge Fire farther north in the county, which broke out several hours later in the brushy hills of Yorba Linda, kept more than 70,000 people from their homes Tuesday as winds returned, but not as strongly as the day before when they blew over tractor-trailers and grounded firefighting aircraft.

A lo largo del pasado verano se desarrollaron dos actuaciones en la antigua fortaleza medieval de A Rocha Forte, una de ellas para la mejora de los accesos al recinto, y otra para la consolidación del interior del yacimiento.
 Como es preceptivo, estas labores fueron acompañadas de unos sondeos previos en el terreno, y en el transcurso de los mismos se descubrieron importantes vestigios arqueológicos, que como señalaba la concejala de Urbanismo, Mercedes Rosón, han permitido una nueva visión del antiguo castillo, y confirmado la opinión de algunos expertos que señalaban que se trataba de una de las fortalezas más importantes de la Galicia medieval.
 En las excavaciones aparecieron nuevos elementos del sistema defensivo que protegía la entrada del castillo, y que tienen unas considerables dimensiones; nuevos muros, y también dos fosos con una profundidad de tres metros. En uno de los muros, además, también se descubrió la base de una torre circular.
 Estos hallazgos vienen a completar los descubrimientos que se fueron haciendo a lo largo de las diferentes campañas que se llevaron a cabo en el recinto desde hace ya más de una década, y que sacaron a la luz tanto la zona central de la fortaleza del Arzobispado de Santiago, que tenía planta cuadrada, y contaba con dos murallas defensivas concéntricas, además de una torre del homenaje ubicada en el centro. Parte del yacimiento se vio alterado cuando se construyó la vía del ferrocarril por sus proximidades.
 En la documentación de la época, especialmente en el famoso pleito _Tabera- Fonseca_ se aludía a una tercera muralla, por lo que a finales de 2019 se inició su busca a través de una prospección geofísica con un sistema de tomografía de resistividad eléctrica, trabajos que fueron realizados por el geólogo Óscar Pazos y la arqueóloga María José Bóveda. A partir de estos datos se inició la excavación en busca de la tercera defensa del castillo, una campaña de sondeos valorativos que dirigió el arqueólogo Mario César, de la empresa Tempos Arqueólogos, y confirmaron la existencia de una muralla con torre circular y fosos a ambos lados, así como toda una serie de estructuras como muros o canalizaciones.
 Los trabajos fueron promovidos por el Ayuntamiento a través de la Oficina de Rehabilitación y forman parte del programa Edusi, cofinanciado en un 80 % por Fondos Europeos. El objetivo del proyecto es investigar esta fortaleza, edificada por el Arzobispado de Santiago en el siglo XII como residencia, pero también para proteger y controlar fiscalmente el acceso a la ciudad por el sur.
 A lo largo de sus más de doscientos años de existencia fue escenario de importantes acontecimientos históricos, entre ellos varios asedios, fruto de los enfrentamientos entre la autoridad eclesiástica y los vecinos de Santiago, hasta su destrucción en el año 1467, en el marco de la revuelta Irmandiña, cuando era arzobispo compostelano Alonso II de Fonseca. Quedó en ruinas hasta las excavaciones de este siglo.

James Ross Johnson, Jr. February 2, 1931 - October 24, 2020 Charlotte, North Carolina - James Ross Johnson, Jr. of Charlotte, NC, age 89, passed away peacefully at the home he designed on October 24th, 2020. Born February 2nd, 1931, in Florence County, SC, he was the son of the late Reverend J. Ross Johnson and Leilah Smith Johnson of Sumter, SC. He is survived by his wife, Sara Bee Craig Johnson; his daughter, Rebekah Susan Johnson Headen; his son, Craig Ross Johnson; and his two grandsons, Franklin Craig Headen and James Edward Headen. In the late summer of 1937 Jim was infected with polio and could not walk. He fully recovered thanks to a new approach developed by Sister Elizabeth Kenny, which was highly controversial at the time. Jim graduated from Orangeburg High School in 1949 where he was the Senior Class President and Captain of the football team. He graduated college with a degree in Architecture from Clemson College, now Clemson University, in 1954. His claim to fame at Clemson was his stint as the Clemson Tiger mascot. After spending almost two years as a Bridge Specialist in Germany with the Army Corps of Engineers, he returned to the U.S. and took a job in Charleston, SC, and shortly thereafter moved to Charlotte, NC. He was first with JN Pease and then AG Odell Associates. He immediately joined Myers Park United Methodist Church and at one of their singles outings he met his bride, Sara Bee Craig – a recent Queens College graduate, in the summer of 1957. After he became a Registered Architect, he was hired by Craig Phillips, the superintendent of Charlotte Mecklenburg Schools to become the CMS Director of School Construction. After managing over twelve-million dollars of new school construction for CMS, he decided to open his private practice in the Latta Arcade in Charlotte in the late 1960's. While in private practice, in 1972, he was asked by Governor Bob Scott to be the architect part of a three- person team to preserve and restore the NC Capitol Building in Raleigh. The team also included John Sanders with the NC Institute of Government and Orin Bullock, FAIA. His firm received several design awards over the years from the American Institute of Architects. Jim was an active civic leader who served as the President of the Charlotte Civitan Club. Mayor John Belk appointed Jim as the Chair of the Model Cities Planning and Housing Task Force. He designed and planned fifty new housing units in the Cherry and Frazier Street communities for the Charlotte Housing Authority. One of his special projects and one that he was most proud of was his grass roots effort to save the Wendover trees. The trees were planned to be cut down when they widened the road, Jim saw this as a grave mistake as the trees were so majestic, and he was able to convince the city to save the trees. He is the reason they are still there for our enjoyment today. He loved to watch Clemson football, body surfing, reading, writing notes, reciting poetry, drinking sweet tea, eating at Showmars and the Waffle House, telling corny jokes, traveling to the mountains of NC, the beaches of SC and his all-time favorite city, Charleston, SC. A private memorial service will be held on Friday, October 30, at Myers Park United Methodist Church. In lieu of flowers, memorials may be sent to the Mark Headen Endowed Scholarship fund at the NC Outward Bound School, 2582 Riceville Road, Asheville, NC, 28805, (828) 239.2145. Condolences may be offered at www.harryandbryantfuneralhome.com.

Texas Tech coach Matt Wells marvels a bit when he looks at Oklahoma redshirt freshman quarterback Spencer Rattler.
 "Arm talent, sick," Wells said. "I mean, the guy flips his wrist and the ball flies. He's very accurate, he can throw it on the run, he runs well in the pocket. ... He has got big-time arm talent."
 Wells and the Red Raiders will get an up-close familiarity with Rattler on Saturday when Texas Tech hosts No. 24 Oklahoma.
 The Red Raiders (2-3, 1-3 Big 12) are coming off a 34-27 win over West Virginia.
 In that game, which snapped a three-game losing streak, Wells went with quarterback Henry Colombi, a Utah State transfer, after Alan Bowman started the first four games of the season.
 Colombi earned another shot after completing 22 of his 28 passes for 169 yards and a touchdown against the Mountaineers. He also rushed for 40 yards and a score.
 "It's been interesting to see with the new guy," Sooners coach Lincoln Riley said of Colombi and Texas Tech's offense. "I would think they continue to gain some confidence in him and continue to open it for him.
 "But they're doing a lot of good things, and they've always been creative offensively and do a good job of mixing tempo and different formations and challenging you in different ways."
 On the other side, Rattler has had a strong beginning to his career, throwing for 1,518 yards and 15 touchdowns with five interceptions through his first five games as a starter.
 Rattler has been especially good since he was benched briefly in the second quarter against Texas on Oct. 10, an eventual 53-45 win after four overtimes.
 "Coming out and being a starting quarterback at this level -- especially at a school like this -- you have to experience it," Riley said.
 "As much as you can mentally prepare guys and do everything you can to get them ready and talk to them and have guys who have been in that same position talk to them, it's just experiencing it is another thing. I think he's getting more used to the emotions, the ups and downs and just what it feels like."
 The Sooners have won eight consecutive games in the series against the Red Raiders, averaging just over 50 points per game and never scoring fewer than 38 during that streak.
 Of course, Oklahoma's offense has put up a ton of points on everybody in recent years, scoring at least 28 points in a school-record 57 consecutive games. Alabama is a distant second with an active streak of 18 such games.
 The Sooners (3-2, 2-2) could have a couple key players back on Saturday.
 Wide receiver Trejan Bridges, defensive end Ronnie Perkins and running back Rhamondre Stevenson were suspended before last season's bowl game after reportedly failing an NCAA drug test, and they haven't played since.
 Barring further complications, Bridges and Stevenson figure to be available against Texas Tech. The situation is a bit more unclear regarding Perkins, because there were snags after he had a chance to be reinstated earlier in the month, the Tulsa World reported.

United’s collapse against Tottenham in early October plunged the club back into crisis mode as the Norwegian scrambled to fix his broken defence.
 The sense of panic has receded, with a 4-1 win at Newcastle followed by an impressive 2-1 away victory against Paris Saint-Germain in United’s European opener.
 But the Red Devils played out a drab 0-0 stalemate against Chelsea at an empty Old Trafford at the weekend, leaving them without a Premier League win at home this season.
 Solskjaer’s team became the first United side since the 1972/73 season to fail to win any of their opening three home league matches — leaving them languishing in the lower reaches of the table.
 Despite the underwhelming result, the manager was sanguine after Saturday’s home draw, which came after an embarrassing 3-1 reverse against Crystal Palace and the humiliating 6-1 thumping by Tottenham both at Old Trafford.
 “We had a clean sheet, we had some pressure, we stopped the home run of defeats,” he said.
 “We wanted to win, of course you want to win at home, but I think it’s a solid performance when you think of the week we’ve had. We’ve had a very good week with two wins and a draw.”
 In sharp contrast to their poor home form, United have been genuinely impressive on the road. Their eye-catching victory in Paris was their 10th consecutive away win, excluding games at neutral venues — a new club record.
 Solskjaer has speculated that one reason for the drop-off in home form is the change of routine during the lockdown period. He is also desperate for the return of fans to add noise and colour.
 The manager changed the pre-match routine before the Chelsea game in an effort to turn round his side’s Old Trafford fortunes, taking them to stay in a hotel the night before the game.
 Despite United’s inconsistency, defender Luke Shaw believes they are heading the right direction.
 “When we’re on the pitch now, it feels different to what it was before (at the start of the season). Before, we made a lot of sloppy, silly mistakes — individual mistakes —s and I think we’ve learned from that and we’ve worked hard in training,” he said.
 “We knew we needed to improve, and I think we need to build on this today (Saturday) and take it to Wednesday.”
 Victory against the Bundesliga leaders would put United in a strong position to finish in the top two in Group H, with a double-header to come between Leipzig and PSG.
 But Julian Nagelsmann’s in-form team, who started their European campaign with a 2-0 win against Istanbul Basaksehir, also have a chance to stamp their authority on the group.
 Solskjaer must decide whether to stick or twist against the Germans, who reached the semi-finals of last season’s Champions League.
 He played a makeshift three-man central defence of Axel Tuanzebe, Luke Shaw and Victor Lindelof in Paris, with Aaron Wan-Bissaka and new signing Alex Telles operating as wing-backs.
 But Solksjaer reverted to a back four against Chelsea, with Harry Maguire, who endured a rocky start to the season on and off the pitch, back in the side.
 Solskjaer also has decisions to make in midfield.
 Scott McTominay and Fred have started all three games since the international break, with Paul Pogba coming on as a substitute each time to add forward thrust.
 Solskjaer is spoilt for choice up front, with new signing Edinson Cavani and Mason Greenwood in the mix and Anthony Martial available despite his domestic ban alongside Marcus Rashford.
 The Norwegian is becoming used to false dawns but a win against the German league leaders would be another sign that United might be heading in the right direction.

Granted, the method doesn’t quite work as planned, but this is relatively unimportant. The Founders believed citizens would be able to select electors known to them from their towns and states and would send these local leaders to vote for them in the Electoral College, which is at the heart of representative government. They wished to avoid control of the process by political parties, organizations that James Madison called “factions.”
 In a short time, political parties arose. This led to a necessary adjustment resulting in the 12th Amendment to the Constitution. This change separated the vote for president and vice president, which is what the current system allows.
 So while we can acknowledge that the method doesn’t quite work as planned, this is a matter of mechanics. The foundational principle of federalism is preserved in the current setup, which is fundamental to the process.
 A recent complaint is that the system was designed to protect slavery. This is the latest faddish attempt to discredit the Electoral College with an argument based on race without much knowledge of history.
 Slavery certainly was an issue at the Constitutional Convention but was not critical in how to select the president. Small states like Connecticut, New Hampshire and Rhode Island, which favored federalism, were for the most part already free from slavery or in the process of ending it. And the largest slave state at the time, Virginia, would be at a disadvantage with this election process but agreed that protecting the small states was important.
 Is the Electoral College here to stay or not? It would not be as easy to eliminate as some wish, though several schemes are in the pipeline to do so. Hopefully, any such efforts will be unsuccessful. The end of the Electoral College would be a death knell for our republic.

Put down the pencils. Hang the costumes in the closet. And put the blade covers back on the skates. Lest anyone forget, the coronavirus is giving Massachusetts a not so gentle reminder that it never really left.
 Boston Mayor Marty Walsh pulled back on in-person learning last week, taking Boston Public Schools completely remote as transmission of the coronavirus continues to increase in the city.
 The decision was made just two weeks after Walsh said the negative impacts for some high-needs students of not returning to the classroom could not be "mitigated" the way the risk of spreading the virus could.
 The exit from the classroom in Boston earned the city a mention on the presidential debate stage on Oct. 22, where President Donald Trump continued to insist the country had turned a corner in its fight against the virus. Gov. Charlie Baker hasn't gone that far, and doesn't agree with the president on much these days, but on the issue of schools the two Republicans seem to be reading from the same page.
 Baker said he wouldn't "Monday morning quarterback" Walsh's decision for Boston, but said again that it's not schools where the virus is spreading. Instead, the governor continued to blame social gatherings, primarily of 19- to 39-year-olds, where masks are not being worn and distancing not observed.
 In Massachusetts, the daily new case count almost reached 1,000 on Thursday and the seven-day weighted average positive test rate ticked up to 1.5 percent as 77 cities and towns are now in the state's highest-risk "red" category. And his own Department of Public Health decided to shut down ice skating rinks due to clusters of infections the state has observed linked to hockey games, practices and tournaments.
 The state, however, is far from being in retreat.
 In fact, Baker last week called attention to what his administration described as an ongoing $775 million economic stimulus program that included $115 million in just available funding, the highlight of which was a new $50.8 million grant program for hard hit small businesses.
 "To be clear, there's no substitute for the size and scope that a federal aid package could deliver. But that doesn't seem to be in the offing and we certainly don't believe that we can wait," Baker said.
 While Baker continued to beat the "buy, shop and dine locally" drum, on the North Shore, Salem was looking for the opposite of a jolt to its economy. At least until after this month is over.
 With Baker back for the second time in two weeks, Salem Mayor Kim Driscoll pleaded with tourists to stay away, concerned that the ghosts, ghouls and goblins flocking to the Witch City to celebrate All Hallows' Eve were creating a petri dish for COVID-19. Billboards have even been added to state highways announcing the city as closed on October weekends.
 "This is not the year to come to Salem, this is not the year to visit," Driscoll said.
 Stores are being asked to lock up early the next two weekends, parking lots ordered to close and MBTA trains will bypass the city on Fridays and Saturdays before November.
 "I really feel like the fun police here, right? It's the cats-are-biting-the- dogs sorts of scenarios," Driscoll said.
 Back on Beacon Hill, most legislators are nowhere to be found, doing the work of their district or making sure they get reelected to stay long enough to see the state through this pandemic. A group of legislators on the House and Senate Ways and Means committees, however, are deeply immersed in budget planning, and dug deeper into the weeds this week when they hosted a hearing on Baker's revised budget proposal for fiscal 2021.
 Baker last week downgraded his expectations for tax revenues this year by $3.6 billion, and offered an updated $45.5 billion spending plan that used a lot of one-time revenue sources to avoid the harshest of cuts.
 Some legislators said this week they were comfortable with Baker's proposed $1.35 billion withdrawal from the state's reserves, which would leave about $2.2 billion for next year. "That makes you very comfortable because that's what the rainy day is all about," said Rep. Paul Donato, a Medford Democrat and assistant majority leader.
 But House and Senate leaders were definitely not ready to put their full stamp of approval on Baker's revised budget, or offer a timeline for when they might offer their own "The governor proposes, the Legislature disposes," said Senate Ways and Means Chairman Michael Rodrigues, repeating what has become a go-to line for him in recent weeks.
 Baker's budget chief Michael Heffernan said the administration is focused on stabilizing state services during this crisis, recognizing that people need government the most during times of crisis. That means the administration will not be looking to lay people off or cut back on eligibility for safety net programs, as long as something dramatic doesn't wildly change the state's fortunes, he said.
 Baker has asked for a budget to be done by Thanksgiving, and while that's technically still possible, though unlikely, the one thing that's certain is that nothing will be done before election day on Nov. 3.
 With less than two weeks until voting ends in Massachusetts, more than a quarter of the state's 4.6 million registered voters have already cast their ballots. Of the 1.3 million votes cast, almost 890,000 have been by mail, with the rest of the voters turning up in person since early voting opened on Oct. 17.
 So for a good chunk of the electorate, Baker was too late when he made his endorsement this week of Republican Kevin O'Connor in the Dover attorney's long shot race against U.S. Sen. Edward Markey. In a hand-held cellphone video, Baker said O'Connor would bring "feet-on-the-ground" representation to Washington.
 But Baker's endorsement of O'Connor was perhaps more notable for the fact that he chose to back another Republican for Senate, along with Susan Collins of Maine. If O'Connor were to win, the odds of the GOP retaining control of the U.S. Senate would increase greatly, and it can't be assumed that's what Baker wants, even if he is trying to shore up his right flank.
 Baker has been frustrated with both parties in Washington, and particularly his own. He has criticized Congress' inability to get a stimulus deal done, and disagrees with the decision of his party to press forward with the confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court.
 He is also not voting for President Donald Trump for reelection.
 Asked about the final debate between Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden on Thursday night, Baker said he would be on Zoom calls into the evening, but if he finished in time he would turn it on. It turned out that Zoom call was planned with Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan to whip up support for Vermont Gov. Phil Scott, a Republican running for reelection to the north, according to VTDigger.
 The governors reportedly discussed managing the COVID-19 crisis and government as Republicans in blue states.
 "If you look around America, you'll discover that most of the governors who seem to do well with their electorate tend to be people who can work with everybody and who focus more on the work and a little less on the noise," Baker said, according to VTDigger. "And I don't think that's a coincidence."

This is no irresponsible license for postmodernism or relativism, nor is it the belief that “anything goes.” Rather, this call for a Talmudic view of the Constitution rests on the rabbis’ view of themselves as charged with the preservation of the most sacred text to exist, the Torah; they realized that it was in the process of preserving it that they made it sacred.

The “gift” goal came in the eighth minute when he put a little excitement in a point-blank shot while standing on the goal line for a 1-0 lead.
 Later, Agustin Garcia’s present came in the form of a perfect crossing pass that he converted while in stride in the 55th minute for the winning goal.
 “I’m really happy for Wayner,” said Williamsport coach Chris Downs. “He works incredibly hard. He can play up top, but we had him in the middle today. It’s nice to see a kid like that have success.”
 Agustin Garcia darted around the field while Williamsport controlled the ball in its end for much of the first half. The Wildcats tried on a number of occasions to connect with him to make moves.
 The game was played in physical fashion, with a number of players hitting the turf while contesting to get the ball. There were three yellow cards handed out in the game.
 “This was a normal game when we play Williamsport,” said North coach Uriel Galvin. “Sometimes it gets a little chippy.”
 But part of it is many of the players are so familiar with each other after playing for years in the school and club ball circuits.
 “Everyone knows each other,” Downs said. “They all compete hard in the game and then they forget about it and shake hands.”
 Shots were at a premium early and neither team had many open tries until Agustin Garcia got his gift in that eighth minute.
 Jonathan Kline hustled the ball down the left side of the field and cut slightly toward the middle. He unloaded the ball to the goal mouth, where Agustin Garcia stood, flanked by two North defenders and goalkeeper Nicholas Profilio.
 Agustin Garcia took a swing at the ball, but didn’t connect solidly. It popped straight up in the air and hit the bottom of the crossbar. The ball came down as quickly as it went up, landing across the line for a score.

Born February 2nd, 1931, in Florence County, SC, he was the son of the late Reverend J. Ross Johnson and Leilah Smith Johnson of Sumter, SC. He is survived by his wife, Sara Bee Craig Johnson; his daughter, Rebekah Susan Johnson Headen; his son, Craig Ross Johnson; and his two grandsons, Franklin Craig Headen and James Edward Headen.   In the late summer of 1937 Jim was infected with polio and could not walk. He fully recovered thanks to a new approach developed by Sister Elizabeth Kenny, which was highly controversial at the time. Jim graduated from Orangeburg High School in 1949 where he was the Senior Class President and Captain of the football team. He graduated college with a degree in Architecture from Clemson College, now Clemson University, in 1954. His claim to fame at Clemson was his stint as the Clemson Tiger mascot.   After spending almost two years as a Bridge Specialist in Germany with the Army Corps of Engineers, he returned to the U.S. and took a job in Charleston, SC, and shortly thereafter moved to Charlotte, NC. He was first with JN Pease and then AG Odell Associates. He immediately joined Myers Park United Methodist Church and at one of their singles outings he met his bride, Sara Bee Craig – a recent Queens College graduate, in the summer of 1957. After he became a Registered Architect, he was hired by Craig Phillips, the superintendent of Charlotte Mecklenburg Schools to become the CMS Director of School Construction. After managing over twelve-million dollars of new school construction for CMS, he decided to open his private practice in the Latta Arcade in Charlotte in the late 1960's.   While in private practice, in 1972, he was asked by Governor Bob Scott to be the architect part of a three-person team to preserve and restore the NC Capitol Building in Raleigh. The team also included John Sanders with the NC Institute of Government and Orin Bullock, FAIA. His firm received several design awards over the years from the American Institute of Architects.   Jim was an active civic leader who served as the President of the Charlotte Civitan Club. Mayor John Belk appointed Jim as the Chair of the Model Cities Planning and Housing Task Force. He designed and planned fifty new housing units in the Cherry and Frazier Street communities for the Charlotte Housing Authority. One of his special projects and one that he was most proud of was his grass roots effort to save the Wendover trees. The trees were planned to be cut down when they widened the road, Jim saw this as a grave mistake as the trees were so majestic, and he was able to convince the city to save the trees. He is the reason they are still there for our enjoyment today.   He loved to watch Clemson football, body surfing, reading, writing notes, reciting poetry, drinking sweet tea, eating at Showmars and the Waffle House, telling corny jokes, traveling to the mountains of NC, the beaches of SC and his all-time favorite city, Charleston, SC.   A private memorial service will be held on Friday, October 30, at Myers Park United Methodist Church.   In lieu of flowers, memorials may be sent to the Mark Headen Endowed Scholarship fund at the NC Outward Bound School, 2582 Riceville Road, Asheville, NC, 28805, (828) 239.2145.   Condolences may be offered at www.harryandbryantfuneralhome.com.

In what we obviously perceive as a teleguided narrative, DJ Switch was found to be speaking from both sides of her mouth when she granted interview to Premium Times on 23rd October, 2020 alleging that armed soldiers and police officers shot at her and other #EndSARS protesters at the Lekki Toll Gate killing at least a total of 15 people. DJ Switch claimed in a video posted on social media that she and some other survivors of the alleged shootings carried dead bodies of the 15 protesters to the feet of the soldiers, who “threw the bodies into their vans”. To add insult to injury, DJ Switch went ahead to display some bullet shells which she claimed were recovered from the scene of the shootings. We are at a loss as to why DJ Switch could tell a bare-faced lie to Nigerians and the international community that the military killed 15 protesters while bodies of victims could not be found.

Eitam described himself as a "unifier" and consensus builder, and said his full record would be fairly reviewed.
 "Those people who will have to make the decision, no doubt they will consider all the aspects of the nomination and they will come to a decision," he said.
 Eitam would replace Avner Shalev, 81, who announced his retirement earlier this year after leading Yad Vashem for 27 years. A spokesman for Yad Vashem declined to comment.
 Yad Vashem is a non-political and almost sacred institution in Israel. Before the coronavirus pandemic it regularly hosted visits by students, soldiers and other tour groups, as well as the country's annual Holocaust remembrance day ceremony. Visiting world leaders nearly always pay their respects at Yad Vashem for the 6 million Jews murdered by Nazi Germany and its collaborators during the Second World War.
 Colette Avital, a former Israeli diplomat and lawmaker who heads the Center of Organizations of Holocaust Survivors in Israel, expressed concern over Eitam's nomination, saying Yad Vashem should be led by someone with a background in Holocaust research and education.
 "Yad Vashem is really the embodiment of an institution that speaks on behalf of minorities," she said. "It's really very difficult to accept statements like the ones he made."
 "There are enough people, whether it's BDS or whether it's people that deny the Holocaust and so on, who will say 'Look, the guy, how can he speak on behalf of Holocaust survivors when this is what he says about the Arabs?'" she said, referring to the Palestinian-led boycott, divestment and sanctions movement.
 Eitam's appointment may help Netanyahu domestically as he goes on trial for corruption and seeks to solidify his right-wing base amid weekly protests and widespread anger at the government's handling of the pandemic. But it could worsen the divide between Israel and the Jewish Diaspora, particularly Jewish Americans, who tend to be more liberal.
 Netanyahu has come under fire internationally and from Yad Vashem itself for embracing right-wing leaders in Europe who offer political support to Israel while also giving voice to a distorted view of the Holocaust.
 In recent years, formerly communist nations like Poland, Hungary, Lithuania and Ukraine have sought to blame the Holocaust entirely on Nazi Germany while absolving their own citizens of responsibility and commemorating anti-Soviet fighters who collaborated with the Nazis.
 Yad Vashem also came out against a government plan in 2018 to deport tens of thousands of African migrants, saying the issue was a "national and international challenge that requires empathy, compassion and mercy."
 "The experience of the Jewish people over generations heightens this obligation," it said.

Mookie Betts was a difference-maker for the Dodgers in his first season in Los Angeles.
 The speedy outfielder bolted from third for the go-ahead run on Corey Seager's infield grounder in the sixth and led off the eighth with a punctuating homer Tuesday night, helping the Dodgers beat the Tampa Bay Rays 3-1 to claim their first World Series championship since 1988.
 Betts' 3.2-second sprint was just enough to beat the throw by first baseman Ji-Man Choi, pushing Los Angeles ahead 2-1 moments after Rays manager Kevin Cash pulled ace left-hander Blake Snell despite a dominant performance over 5 1/3 innings.
 It is Betts' second World Series title. He starred for the Boston Red Sox when they beat the Dodgers for the title in 2018.
 "You don't win a World Series without any of those 28 guys in there, but obviously, he made a huge impact on our team, huge impact on our postseason and tonight a huge impact on the game," ace Clayton Kershaw said.
