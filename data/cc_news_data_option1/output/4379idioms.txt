In response, Trump repeated falsehoods he’s deployed in the past—asserting, for example, that wind power is “extremely expensive” and inflating the cost of Biden’s $2 trillion climate plan by a factor of 50—while Biden called climate change an “existential threat to humanity” and detailed how he would invest public money to build a clean-energy economy and create jobs. On Welker’s pollution question, Trump rejected the premise, saying incorrectly that the communities she mentioned are paid for their trouble; Biden, meanwhile, gave an informed description of the negative health outcomes that “fenceline” communities routinely face. Despite the uneven back-and-forth, it was a refreshing, all-too-rare moment in US media coverage of the climate story: nearly 12 minutes, in prime time, during which journalism treated climate change as a serious, multidimensional subject worthy of public discourse.

Dear Friends,
 There is a lot of misinformation, missing information, and large amounts of out of state partisan money being expended to try and convince our citizens to vote no on Amendment 3. Here are some facts as I see them:
 Since coming to Jefferson City and serving as your state representative I have discovered the Missouri Constitution can be easily manipulated by a process called “initiative petition,” by obtaining signatures to have an issue, any issue, put on a ballot. Once an issue is on the ballot, if only 51% of the voters, a simple majority, vote in favor then our Missouri Constitution can be changed or added to.
 This antiquated process gives a minority of Missourians the ability to put virtually anything on the ballot that changes the Missouri Constitution which affects us all! These petitions are typically funded by out of state, big money, special interests and usually contain confusing and deceptive ballot language.

Leonardo Bonucci has called for his fellow Juventus players ‘to unite’ after their 2-0 loss to Barcelona last night.
 The Old Lady started the match positively, but were punished by a huge deflected goal, before our rivals moved to control the game intelligently.
 We will have to consider ourselves slightly unlucky to have three goals, all scored by Alvaro Morata, ruled out after being checked by VAR, especially following the extended period of time waiting for the third one to chalked off, but overall we were second best on the night.
 Bonucci has now called for the players to come together to turn things around.
 “It is time to grit our teeth, to unite, and bring out the best in ourselves, because we get results that are not up to us,” last night’s stand-in captain said (as translated by Juventus’ official website).
 “We played against a great team, but we made too many mistakes on a technical level and Barcelona are unforgiving. We could have done something more, but the thing that gives me hope is the desire we have to play with the ball at our feet and I’m sure that improving from a technical point of view will be a great season.
 “We miss important players, it’s not an excuse, it’s reality, but in four days we’ll be back on the pitch and we’ll try to do better.”
 Cristiano Ronaldo and Giorgio Chiellini were both missing last night, the two main leaders in the team highlighted by their status as captain and vice- captain respectively, but the team needs to step-up in their absence, and while the performance wasn’t bad, it simply wasn’t good enough to take on Barcelona.
 Is it too early to judge the squad at this point in the season?

Let’s get one thing straight: If humanity is to have any chance of avoiding the worst of climate change, America, like the rest of the world, _must_ transition away from fossil fuels. That’s not politics—it’s science. The United Nations climate science panel says humanity needs to cut emissions in half by 2030, and reach net-zero emissions by 2050, to avoid catastrophic climate breakdown. Accordingly, a speedy transition away from fossil fuels has been central to all serious climate advocacy for years. Such a transition, via heavy investments in clean energy, is central to the climate plan Biden put forward in July.

FREEPORT -- While 2020 has been a difficult year for many nonprofits, the Freeport Community Foundation has been making a difference by awarding a total of $238,326.86 in grants, with $86,258.93 to 13 area nonprofits in fall grants.
   
 "Speaking on behalf of the Freeport Community Foundation Board of Directors, it is both rewarding and humbling to distribute our Fall 2020 Matt Marvin Community Needs grants," said Michelle DeHaven, the foundation's executive director. "There is a great need throughout the communities of northwest Illinois, and our organization is honored to be in a position to be able to at least provide some support for the nonprofit organizations and, by extension, the residents of our regional community."
   
 DeHaven said this has been an unusual year. FCF is northwest Illinois' leading agency in nonprofit philanthropy. While they had to pivot this year from the traditional Matt Marvin Community Needs granting in the early spring to a conduit for emergency relief granting through relationships with the Alliance of Illinois Community Foundations and the Illinois COVID-19 Response Fund, the foundation is back again to a second round of our traditional granting for fall.
   
 As a result, 2020 will go down as the year the Freeport Community Foundation distributed slightly over $500,000 in grant funding from spring to fall to northwest Illinois nonprofits -- $260,000 which came from state COVID-19 Response Fund sources.
   
 "It is, by far, the most funding the Freeport Community Foundation has ever distributed in a single year, and it has been an honor to be in this position of servant leadership for our region during this crisis," DeHaven said.
   
 The nonprofit receiving the most for a fall grant is the Jo Daviess Conservation Foundation, which received $20,000 to go toward a feasibility study to build the Wapello Discovery Center at the Wapello Land & Water Preserve near Hanover.
   
 "We are thrilled to be chosen as a recipient of the Freeport Community Foundation's fall grant cycle," said Steve Barg, executive director for the Jo Daviess Conservation Foundation. "The $20,000 grant that we are receiving is for a professional feasibility study of a proposed Wapello Discovery Center that we hope to construct at our 338 -acre Wapello Land and Water Reserve along the Apple River just south of Hanover."
   
 The Wapello Discovery Center will be the first of its kind in the tri-state region, a place where visitors can learn about the rich and diverse tribal heritage of this region through the stories, art and culture of descendant tribal communities.
   
 Illinois has no federally recognized tribal nations left. The tribal groups that inhabited this area for hundreds and thousands of years before European settlement were often forcibly removed from their ancestral homelands during the period following the National Indian Removal Act of 1830.
   
 Despite efforts to erase their culture, descendants of these groups still exist today in the federally recognized Ho-Chunk, Sac and Fox, Meskwaki, Iowa, Potawatomi, and the Osage tribal nations. The proposed Wapello Discovery Center will interpret their histories as told through their people, along with the natural heritage of the southern Driftless region and lower Apple River Valley.
   
 "We know through historical records that tribes existed," Barg said. "We are interested to interpret the heritage of this land."
