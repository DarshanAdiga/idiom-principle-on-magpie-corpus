But he also said he fears people may draw the wrong lesson about the seriousness of the disease from what happened to Trump: “People may extrapolate that the risk for a 74 is low when the reality is the risk to a 74 year-old is quite high.”
 Dr. Beth Oller, who practices family medicine with her physician-husband in rural Kansas’ Rooks County, isn’t optimistic the president’s diagnosis will change much in her community, where cases are on the rise, many resist masks, and weddings with hundreds of guests have been held in recent weeks.
 “None of the things he did since he had it have helped us a bit, and, if anything, would fly in the face of it,” she said, noting that the president took his mask off as soon as he returned to the White House. “All he did was continue to show people that the things we are saying to do are overblown and an overreaction. As a physician, it is so damn frustrating.”
 The issue has been a challenge in red states for months.

My wife and I find ourselves relying more and more on reading glasses, cheaters as most folks call them.
 It started, for me, a few years ago when I was working as an accountant and found that it was becoming more and more difficult to see the tiny numbers I was dealing with on a daily basis.
 My contact lens prescription is geared to help me see better for driving and wandering about in the vast expanses of the world, not so much for being able to see things like the tiny screws you have to navigate to change the batteries on the grandkids’ toys.
 The computer screen in front of me, I can see. To read something on my phone has become a game of hit and miss. It’s an adventure sometimes to see if that text says, “Let go and let God” or “Let’s go and get food.” Either way, I’m good, but I don’t want to show up expecting a hamburger when there’s not one on the horizon.

CANYON, Texas (KFDA) - The City of Canyon will begin the first of several upgrades to Conner Park this month.The City of Canyon Parks Department will begin working on a major tree trimming and tree removal project in the park.“This project is the first of several that will be occurring in Conner Park over the next two years,” said Canyon Parks Director Brian Noel. “Conner Park has been the heart and soul of the Canyon Parks system for many years. It is time for us to prepare the park for a bright future that will meet the needs of our community for many years to come.” According to a news release, the project will involve the trimming of all Siberian Elms in the park and the removal of several trees in the park and in the Creekmere Street median.“Many of the trees in Conner Park have lived well beyond their life expectancy and due to several factors, they have actually become hazardous,” said Noel. “it is always difficult to cut down trees in the Panhandle and especially when they have been a part of Conner Park for so many years; however, the trees that we will be removing are either dead or have become a safety hazard in the park. We hope that the next generation of Canyon residents will enjoy the trees we are planting this year as much as we have appreciated the trees that were planted in the park over 50 years ago." Once the trees have been trimmed and removed, staff will grind up the stumps and roots. 24 new trees including Burr Oaks, Red Oaks, Cedar Elms and Chinese Pistachio will be planted in the park.Once the tree project is completed, city staff will begin replacing the irrigation system in the park. “These improvements to Conner Park are part of our plan to prepare the park for the Kylie Hiner Memorial Playground, which we hope to open in 2022,” said Noel. “We know that future generations will enjoy the shade and beauty that these new trees will bring to the park.” For safety reasons, staff will place fencing in the park that will close the east end of Creekmere Street at times while they work on the trees in the street median.

While billions are being spent on the search for a Covid-19 vaccine and treatment, experts say there may be something you can do to help avoid the virus that costs nothing: open the window.
 Growing evidence suggests that allowing air to circulate around enclosed spaces can help disperse the air-borne viral droplets that cause infection.
 These fine clouds of particles, known as aerosols, are thought to be able to remain suspended in the air for long periods, even hours.
 That's where reaching for the window latch may help.
 Epidemiologist Antoine Flahault likened dispersing the viral cloud to airing out a room when someone is smoking.
 "What do you do? You open a window to let the smoke out," he told AFP. "And it's the same for these invisible coronavirus aerosols."
 The American Centers for Disease Control updated its advice this week to include guidance on enclosed areas.
 "Avoid crowded indoor spaces and ensure indoor spaces are properly ventilated by bringing in outdoor air as much as possible," it now says on its website.
 \- Cheap, effective -
 The CDC has added aerosols to its official list of coronavirus transmission routes, although the main way the virus spreads is still through respiratory droplets emitted by infectious individuals.
 Experts in other countries have argued for months for more rigorous measures to dispel the threat of aerosol transmission, which were largely absent from public health guidance at the start of the pandemic.
 Germany is one country where official guidance encourages people to leave the windows open.
 Chancellor Angela Merkel said last month that ventilation "could be one of the least expensive and most effective measures to stop the propagation of the pandemic."
 Bernhard Junge-Hulsing, a German doctor, advised people to keep the windows open, at home or at work, even as winter approaches.
 "You can always wear a pullover," he said.
 \- Host of measures -
 But how much ventilation is enough to disperse the aerosol?
 "We recommend a total recirculation of the air in a room at least six times an hour. That takes quite a lot," said Flahault, director of the University of Geneva's Global Health Institute.
 In certain settings this can be achieved by circulation systems, which are often fitted with high-tech filters that also cleanse the air.
 "Six times an hour is what you find on board a TGV (high-speed train) or aeroplane, where the air quality is very good," said Flahault.
 "But in most closed spaces we don't have that level of ventilation."
 Although opening windows could help avoid spreading the coronavirus, experts stress that no single measure can guarantee protection.
 "Limit the number of people in the room, don't stay in it too long, maintain social distancing, wear a mask at all times, wash your hands regularly and try not to talk or shout too much," said Flahault.

Be honest now, how many people even remember Max Headroom? For those of us that do, he's a hard one to forget since thanks to Matt Frewer and the makeup department he's a pretty easy personality to remember given his over the top act and the fact that he did have the look of being a computer-generated program. Back in 1985 when he came out the technology wasn't nearly where it needed to be for this effect and Frewer had to be put through an arduous 4-hour makeup process and described the effect as being inside a giant tennis ball since it was stifling and it was largely uncomfortable. But he did it all the same and he helped to create a character that was from a dystopian future where TV had taken over pretty much everything. Max was just one more symbol for the 80s and for pop culture since a lot of people took to liking him without question since he was amusing and kind of out there with his act. The thing about Max though is that eventually his act did run a bit dry and he was left behind as a relic, a throwback from the 80s that was still fairly popular in the 90s, but didn't really make it into the 2000s in a big way since technology had taken over and things were moving ahead at a pretty good clip.

The litigation set off a venomous years-long legal battle that tarnished the NHL’s image and its relationship with its former stars. Players wrote first- person accounts of their health problems in major newspapers. They wrote about suffering from memory loss, confusion, dramatic mood swings, poor judgment, anxiety and depression. The NHL argued in court filings that players didn’t have the mental capacity to write their own stories and were being manipulated by greedy attorneys. The league alleged that players waited too long to file their claims and that, thanks to the publicly available information about concussions, players should have “put two and two together” about the consequences of repeated brain trauma.

The new Athens County Emergency Medical Services building is currently being constructed at 21 Kenny Drive in Athens, but it appears there are some issues with some of the completed work.
 The new building was called for by officials who cited a need for more space, additionally noting maintenance issues with the building and a lack of certain facilities.
 The new site’s property was donated to the city of Athens by TS Tech, which has a nearby facility. The city signed an agreement with the commissioners in October 2019 for the station to be built on the land, and the construction contract was awarded to Hoon Inc., of Athens. The total contract cost was $2.33 million.
 At the Tuesday, Oct. 6 Athens County Commissioner meeting, Don Dispenza, the project architect, told the board that a small change in the building’s construction has resulted in issues with the station’s air barrier. The building is to be a net zero energy consumer, and to aid with that, a six-inch plastic air and vapor barrier has to be installed on certain parts of the building, Dispenza explained.
 It appears that the changes to the architecture have not affected the building’s blower door test, which measures the airtightness of a structure, as results came back below the limit. Dispenza said the work Hoon did was “outstanding” in terms of quality, but due to the area it was built in, cost the construction company an extra $30,000. Exact numbers are still being nailed down.
 Dispenza noted that he had met with the construction team twice to ensure the air and vapor barrier was installed correctly, and that his drawings specifically note the needed steps to install the barrier correctly.
 “I think we made it clear, and gave them a lot of opportunities to ask questions,” he said.
 Commissioner Charlie Adkins questioned who should be on the hook for the extra $30,000, noting that it appears Dispenza did his due diligence and should not be at fault.
 “There’s no question listening to Don (Dispenza) that we have a good building that’s done right, but I’m struggling with — they bid on a job, it was clear in the architects work, and they decided not to go that route, and now the county is asked to pay $30,000-some additional,” he said. “Is $30,000 what they’re saying it cost them to do it?”
 Change orders are commonplace in large construction projects, and details and more information comes clear in the field.
 “There’s no loss of value to us,” Dispenza explained. “At the end of the day, the drawings are on your side...we told them what to do.”
 Dispenza noted that the majority of the cost to Hoon was in hours worked, utilizing some extra money worked into the contract already to face the costs.
 “I’m willing to split the difference,” Commissioner President Lenny Eliason said, and made a motion to approve the change order for up to $15,000.
 The motion passed unanimously.

The number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits fell slightly last week to a still-high 840,000, evidence that job cuts remain at an elevated level seven months into the pandemic-induced recession.
 The latest sign of a flagging recovery comes two days after President Trump cut off talks over a new rescue aid package that economists say is urgently needed for millions of unemployed Americans and struggling businesses. A failure to enact another round of government aid would crimp household income and spending, and some economists say it would raise the risk of a double-dip recession.
 Thursday’s report from the Labor Department said the number of people continuing to receive unemployment benefits dropped by 1 million to a total of 11 million. The decline suggests that many of the unemployed are being recalled to their old jobs. But it also reflects the fact that some have used up the 26 weeks of their regular state benefits and have transitioned to extended benefit programs that last an additional three months.
 In addition, the government said 464,000 people applied for jobless aid last week under a separate program that has made the self-employed, contractors and gig workers eligible for unemployment benefits for the first time. That was about 45,000 lower than the previous week. As these figures aren’t adjusted for seasonal trends, the government reports them separately from the traditional jobless claims.

 What’s more, Trump’s euphoria was not only chemically induced, but it’s also unlikely to last. Repeated doses of dexamethasone can be quite dangerous. It’s administered only in serious circumstances, signifying to physicians who don’t work for the White House that Trump was a whole lot sicker when he went to Walter Reed than anybody wanted to let on.
 Then where was the hydroxychloroquine, inquiring minds want to know?
 So yes, there’s every chance that even Boss Trump, the political superhero with “the body that men fear and women adore” (in the words of 1950s professional wrestling champ Dr. Jerry Graham, who was bashing rivals with balsa wood chairs at Sunnyside Gardens in Queens, New York, back when Trump was an impressionable lad), will get sicker before he gets better.
 (Graham also carried a formidable swag belly, and pretty much invented the elaborate blond pompadour wrestling villains featured back then. Trump basically stole his whole act.)
 But I digress. The point is that anybody tempted to heed Boss Trump’s advice — “Don’t be afraid of COVID. Don’t let it dominate your life” — would be well- advised to wait a few weeks before venturing maskless to one of his campaign rallies. We don’t know, in Conley’s words, that he’s out of the woods yet. But we do know that he’s actively contagious.
 We also know that Trump cares not at all which Secret Service agents and White House flunkies get infected. Not to mention those anonymous hordes in their MAGA hats and T-shirts.
 Meanwhile, Trump acolyte Rudy Giuliani, himself memorably described by Jimmy Breslin as “a small man in search of a balcony,” went on Fox News to mock Joe Biden for wearing a face mask. Not manly, he said between bouts of heavy coughing. Fox Newsblonde Martha MacCallum said she hoped “that cough is not anything bad.”
 So have I no humane feelings for Boss Trump, his attendant courtiers and poltroons? I’d answer that I have exactly the same degree of empathy and concern he’d have for me and my loved ones.
 I leave it to readers to decide what that might be.

Davisson and Leonardo DiCaprio, her producing partner at their Appian Way production company, were originally exploring the idea of doing a project around a single American hot dog pilot — Chuck Yeager.
 When that fell through, they seized on seven instead — the Mercury Seven, who left military jobs to create the new category of astronaut. The producers reread Wolfe’s book and examined the 1983 film adaptation starring Ed Harris and Sam Shepard, which has a Cold War feel.
 “We went back and we looked at the book, and we realized that as wonderful as the original movie is, there’s so much story that’s left untold. And so we decided to roll up our sleeves and see if we could we could turn it into something,” Davisson said.
 Lafferty was in many ways the perfect man for the job of shepherding the series since he’s been making history come alive for years. He previously examined the computer revolution in the ’80 with “Halt and Catch Fire” and worked on “Manhattan,” which told the story of the scientists who produced the first atomic bombs. He even wrote about Wolfe in his master’s thesis.

Being at our best for loved ones and those around us builds a strong community of support. Humans need connection; kindness creates a better environment overall. This is particularly salient for parents, as children can be influenced by turbulence at home. And at the end of the day, aren’t relationships what our lives are made of? We flourish when we keep good relationships with our families, our friends, our partners, our peers and, of course, ourselves. The appreciation of these relationships can give us the strength to handle any crisis.

 Stuck at the house is both good and bad for Nicks. The good news? Her house is a creative oasis where all her favorite musical instruments live. It’s where she spent a year recording her 2011 album “In Your Dreams” with Dave Stewart and Glen Ballard.

But, in 2022, the all-electric version will land. And coupled with an EV version will be at least one variant with a rotary engine to act as a gasoline-powered range extender. The MX-30 never promised a lofty range estimate at just 124 miles, and if Mazda has any intention of selling the EV in the US, a range extender is likely a good bet. Americans tend to drive further than others.
 While it's exciting to see the rotary engine return in some form, we're still eagerly hoping the automaker has some sort of performance car in the works with the iconic, oddball engine. This past April, a patent application in Japan renewed hope Mazda is at least investigating the idea. The complex patent imagined a rotary engine working with electric motors, inverters and capacitors. The complexity sure sounded like something for a performance car and Mazda even told us back then that it encouraged fans to share where they'd like to see such a powertrain. C'mon, the clear answer is an RX-9.
