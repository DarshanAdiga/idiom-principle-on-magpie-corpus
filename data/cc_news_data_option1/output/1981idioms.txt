WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate is poised to vote Thursday on the nomination of Texas GOP Rep. John Ratcliffe to be Director of National Intelligence, potentially confirming him sooner than expected, as senators are eager to quickly fill the post. Democrats have been opposed to Ratcliffe's nomination, and most are expected to vote against it. But they dropped their usual objections to holding a quick vote as members of both parties want a Senate-confirmed nominee in the job. Democrats usually force procedural votes that slow the nomination process, but are allowing a quick vote Thursday before the Senate leaves town for the next week. The post is now filled by acting director Richard Grenell, a Trump loyalist who has overseen a shakeup in the intelligence community and has raised concerns on Capitol Hill. While Ratcliffe has been similarly loyal to President Donald Trump, he promised in his Senate confirmation hearing to be an independent head of the nation's intelligence agencies and said he would keep Congress informed of important developments. Ratcliffe will replace former DNI Dan Coats, a former Indiana senator who had a good relationship with his former colleagues but frequently clashed with Trump. Since then, Trump, who has long been skeptical of the nation's intelligence community, has installed acting heads and ousted and fired multiple intelligence officials. The Texas Republican was first picked by Trump for the post last summer, shortly after Coats' resignation, but then withdrew after some Senate Republicans questioned his experience. GOP senators warmed to Ratcliffe after Trump unexpectedly nominated him again in February, as concerns grew about Grenell and the turnover in the intelligence community. Most Republicans have praised Ratcliffe since his second nomination. But Democrats have been skeptical that he will serve with the independence they say is crucial for the job. At his hearing, Ratcliffe worked to separate himself from the president, including by saying he believed Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election, a conclusion Trump has often resisted. He said he would communicate to Trump the intelligence community's findings even if he knew Trump disagreed with them and might fire him.Democrats were not convinced. The top Democrat on the panel, Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, told Ratcliffe at the hearing that "I don't see what has changed since last summer," when his nomination was withdrawn.Ratcliffe's nomination was approved 8-7 in a closed committee hearing Tuesday, with all Democrats voting against it, according to a committee aide.Ratcliffe sits on the House intelligence, judiciary and ethics committees. He was a member of Trump's impeachment advisory team last fall and aggressively questioned witnesses during the House impeachment hearings. He also forcefully questioned former special counsel Robert Mueller last summer when Mueller testified about his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.

Spain coach Luis Enrique says playing behind closed doors is "sadder than dancing with your own sister", as football faces the prospect of games without supporters for the foreseeable future due to the coronavirus pandemic.
 Germany's Bundesliga became the first major European league to resume last weekend following the two-month shutdown, with strict hygiene measures enforced at all matches across the country.
 "(Playing without fans) is sadder than dancing with your own sister. It's not attractive," Luis Enrique told the "Colgados del aro" ("Hanging from the hoop") basketball show on Wednesday.
 "I watched the German football and it's a sad sight. You hear the voices, you even hear the insults... you lose the intimacy of the better moments.
 "But you also have to understand it's a business that generates lots of money, and even if the spectacle is a long way from that when there's fans it can help in dealing with the confinement.
 "Watching football again or any other sport, as a fan it's interesting," he added.
 Luis Enrique returned to his job as Spain coach in November after resigning last June to take care of his daughter, Xana, who died in August of cancer.
 "(As a player), I would have liked to get back playing as soon as possible. I have no fear," he said.
 "I was a bit scared at one moment for my parents, my in-laws and the elderly people I cherish and above all for the people who may suffer. But on a personal level, I have zero fear."
 Euro 2020 has been postponed by a year due to the health crisis and Luis Enrique admitted the uncertainty was affecting everyone involved.
 "We're going day by day. We're waiting for football to return and later down the line we will restart with some friendlies.
 "In theory, the national team should play friendly matches in September as usual. But there are more important things right now so we need to be patient."

Network neutrality and privacy groups have called on edge providers to pledge their protections of online information, and Web surfers to join the call for those promises in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica data sharing issue, though they suggested that is just the tip of an iceberg.
 Groups including Fight for the Future, Color of Change and the ACLU have launched SecurityPledge.com as part of the campaign to get tech companies to voluntarily protect the Web public in the wake of "widely reported abuses like the harvesting and manipulation of Facebook data."
 Many of the same groups have argued that ISP pledges to protect privacy and neutrality are insufficient.
 The campaign emphasizes that "demanding" that companies take the pledge is a way to make sure "everyone can choose the services that protect their privacy and security. "Choice" is an important point since the same groups have said that ISP pledges to protect privacy are not sufficient, based on what they say is lack of choice in providers.
 "Over the course of 2018, we will acknowledge those companies that have taken these steps and draw public awareness to those that have left us vulnerable," the groups say.
 Net Neutrality fan Demand Progress signaled it was a flash point for edge providers.
 “The major online platforms are facing a reckoning," said David Segal, executive director. "How they respond in this moment will help determine whether the utopian vision that inspired so many internet pioneers and users stands a chance of becoming a reality, or whether companies will ignore the public interest turn the internet against its users towards the end of private benefit.”
 Fight for the Future's Even Greer was accentuating the positive. "[T]his problem doesn’t begin and end with Facebook. If the largest tech companies take the steps outlined in the security pledge, it will change the course of human history for the better, and protect billions of people’s basic rights.”
 "The time for so-called industry pledges is long past," said Center for Digital Democracy Executive Director Jeff Chester, a longtime advocate for more government oversight of media giants with access to consumer data. "Groups should be calling on Congress to pass legislation that actually provides Americans with real rights over their data. With the new EU data law starting May 25, and U.S. companies scrambling to provide better practices ‘over there,’ advocates should be supporting legislation that will really bring the changes the U.S. desperately requires."The pledge other activists are pushing would be to:
 “Ensure Users Have Access to and Control Over Their Data
 “We need to know that we are in control of our personal information. Commit to meaningful transparency, including providing users full access to all data you have collected and a list of all third parties given access to that data. In addition, provide users full control, which includes requiring explicit opt-in consent, over the retention, sharing, or use of their information, including all data sharing with third parties. Adopt auditing procedures to ensure that shared data is used consistently with the users’ preferences. Guarantee that users have an easy and free way to download all the data you have about them in a usable format. Allow users to delete their entire account and permanently eliminate their data from your servers if they choose to.
 “Protect Our Data
 “We use the Internet to communicate about nearly everything, from banking to politics. Commit to following best practices to secure this information, including offering end-to-end encryption by default. Permit public and independent auditing of systems. Prohibit the use of your products and services, including your APIs, to collect information about your customers and users for commercial tracking or governmental surveillance purposes. If you are the victim of a data breach or contract violation, notify your users promptly if their information has been compromised or shared without their consent. Commit to providing updates to your products when necessary, and notifying customers in the case of breach or identified vulnerabilities. When other companies you work with fail to keep products updated, proactively warn users and potential buyers about them.
 “Limit the Data You Collect
 “Data can last forever and harm people in unpredictable ways. The best way to guard against that harm is to not collect or store it. Review your data collection practices, and stop collecting and storing information that isn't necessary for your product or business.
 “Ensure All Communities Receive Equal Protections
 “Algorithms are not neutral by default, and can easily reflect or exacerbate historical biases. Commit to policies that do not further or exploit discrimination and unequal treatment. From the development stage onward, test and evaluate the impact of products on various communities, including those that have historically been discriminated against. Do not collect information that is vulnerable to misuse, including information about your customers’ and employees’ immigration status, political views, national origin, nationality, or religion, unless required by law or strictly necessary for the service your provide.
 “Resist Improper Government Access and Support Pro-Privacy Laws
 “Supporting strong legal privacy protections can both protect your users and earn their respect. Pledge to refuse voluntary requests for data in non- emergency situations, and fight overly broad, questionable, and illegal efforts to surveil your users, in the courts and in the public sphere. Contribute to the broader conversation about government access to private data by publishing transparency reports detailing requests from governments to the greatest extent allowed by law and by providing notice to individual customers or users whose records are sought or obtained by the government unless barred from doing so.
 “Support laws that enhance user privacy, including laws that require a warrant before the government can demand information about your users. Support reforms that curtail mass surveillance. Support immigration policies that ensure immigrants (including your own employees) are treated humanely, receive due process, and are not discriminated against."

Remote internships, of course, aren't possible in every sector — think of retail or construction. The experts I spoke with say online internships work best when they're project-based, allowing interns to complete assignments on their own time. Mentors should be assigned to work closely with each intern to make sure they don't get lost in the shuffle.
 Arora is trying to build community among his fellow interns. He helped start up a series of group chats that now has hundreds of incoming Apple interns on it. "We're hosting things like Zoom socials just to meet with each other. Asking some questions of previous interns," he says. "So it's a fun time, meeting other people."
 Still, he says he's sad he's missing out on the networking and camaraderie of working at Apple's headquarters. "If the internship was in person, it would have been much better because, you know, you get to make these connections," he says. "You get to meet new people. You have people walking by who are seeing how you're working. And so it's a totally different experience."

Spring is heating up with summer close on its heels. School is out, the days are getting hotter, but despite that, there is still a pandemic keeping people enclosed in their homes.
   
 The City of La Junta is looking into the practicality of opening up The Wipe Out swimming pool at 1190 US 50. City Manager Rick Klein hopes to hear word on the feasibility of doing so by Friday, he said at the Tuesday city council meeting. But unique challenges are posed by the pandemic that the city will need a game plan for.
   
 Mayor Jeffri Pruyn, Council Member Ed Vila and Klein said Tuesday evening that residents of La Junta have approached them with questions about whether the pool would open at all this summer in light of the coronavirus pandemic and social distancing guidelines. Klein told the council that he has been told by moms that if the city is going to announce that the pool won't be opening, they should do it sooner rather than waiting until the last minute, because their kids are so excited for the classic splashing summer experience of visiting the local community pool.
   
 "What we have is a chlorine-type pool, and the chlorine-type pool is the safest type, for Covid," said Klein. "I guess the locker room and stuff, that I'm kind of worried about, but we could just tell people, 'Hey, you come in your trunks and you leave in your trunks.' And we'll have stuff in the bathroom to wipe them down."
   
 Klein said he is trying to gain approval to open the pool this summer from Otero County Health Department. The city anticipates more rules or guidelines to be announced on May 27.
   
 The county planned to submit a variance order request to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment on Tuesday, as commissioners and Crowley / Otero Health Director Rick Ritter discussed at the Monday Board of County Commissioners meeting.
   
 The variance order, if approved by the state, would allow establishments such as bars and restaurants to resume seating customers as long as social distancing and capacity limits are observed, such as six-foot distances between tables and booths, and requiring patrons to wear masks unless seated at their dining tables.
   
 Places of worship and gyms or fitness centers would be required to follow a specific set of similar standards to remain open to the public as well.
   
 The full variance order request submitted by Otero County can be viewed on the county website at oterogov.com.
   
 The variance order request does not address public pools specifically, but nonetheless, Klein foresees some complications the city will have to navigate it if hopes to open the pool safely (assuming the health department allows such).
   
 "How's the rule of 10 affect us?" Klein said on Tuesday.
   
 "The pool is, the number of guards that you have to have, is based upon the square footage of the pool area," said Klein. "Even if we only have five people in there, we still have to have like six guards who are patrolling the area. Which doesn't make sense."
   
 One suggestion was that sections of the pool could be roped off or kept close. Klein said he'd have to mull the idea over.
   
 "I'm hoping (to have an idea) by Friday," Klein told the council. "The sooner we can open it up, we're going to start getting the guards and getting them ready, but, you know, it may take us a week or two. But if we can open up, it's about heatin' time. I've got a feeling that, hopefully, the (confirmed COVID-19 case) numbers will drop. Let's hope and pray. It would be good for the community."
   
 Switching gears, Klein said he was happy to see people enjoying graduation weekend. He noted that Memorial Day weekend has arrived and encouraged residents to enjoy themselves, but to stay safe and practice social distancing guidelines.
   
 "I know we have Memorial Weekend. Everybody needs to be safe. Wear your masks. I know it's going to be hot. But if you're out there in a crowded area, wear a mask. Try to stay away," said Klein.

If Sinclair Broadcast Group's goal in circulating its stations-wide, must-read warning about fake news was to differentiate its local news from the un-moderated social media echo chamber, it was clearly a miscalculation both in a branding sense and a political one. If it was, instead, a wink and nod to President Trump that the broadcaster felt his \"fake news\" pain, as critics assert, it was also a curiously timed spur to critics of its Tribune merger aspirations. First off, Sinclair should…
