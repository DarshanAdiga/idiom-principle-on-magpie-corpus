HOLLAND -- Election Day in Michigan is Tuesday, Nov. 3. With the presidency, a Senate seat and numerous local and statewide races on the ballot, voter turnout is likely to be high as Michiganders decide several key races.
   
 With new voting laws passed in 2018 and recent changes to voting due to the coronavirus pandemic, here is a brief guide on how to make sure you're registered to vote this November.
      
 Who can vote?
   
 To be eligible to vote, you must be a Michigan resident at the time you register and a resident of your city or township for at least 30 days when you vote.
   
 You have to be U.S. citizens, at least 18 years old by Election Day and not currently serving a jail sentence.
   
 How do I register?
   
 Registration can be done at a Secretary of State office, a local clerk's office, voter registration drives, online and at other venues. You can also register to vote on Election Day itself at a local clerk's office.
   
 To register, you must show proof of residence where you are attempting to vote. This can be a driver's license, current utility bill, a bank statement, a paycheck or another government document.
   
 If applying through the mail, you should attach either a photocopy of a driver's license or other photo ID card, or a photocopy of a paycheck stub, utility bill or another government document that contains your name and address.
   
 Once your application is processed, your local clerk will send a voter registration card which should be brought along on Election Day.
   
 -- Know Your Vote is a collaboration between The Sentinel and League of Women Voters Holland Area to increase voter awareness leading up to the 2020 Election. Each Sunday before Election Day, a piece in the series will run as an effort to educate voters on how to exercise their right to vote.

"In un Paese normale - ha aggiunto Cirio - la febbre la misura la scuola. Questo governo ha imposto a tutte le aziende di misurare la febbre agli operai che vanno al lavoro, ha imposto a tutti i sindaci e a tutti gli uffici pubblici di misurare la febbre e dove gestisce lui non misura la febbre ai bambini, che sono soggetti delicati e che nel resto della loro giornata incontrano e convivono con i nonni, che sono le persone più vulnerabili rispetto al Covid…", ha concluso il presidente della Regione Piemonte.

These kicks also up the ante on gender-specific customization – the men’s model has more arch support on the inside, while the women’s version offers support for forward motion. Running safe never looked so good.
