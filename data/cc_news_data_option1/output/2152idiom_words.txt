“9-1-1” actor Ryan Guzman is apologizing defending the use of racial slurs after some of his co-stars known as him out on Twitter.
 Guzman, who performs firefighter Eddie Diaz on the Fox procedural, got here underneath fireplace Sunday after taking to Instagram Live to defend both himself and his fiancée, Brazilian actress Chrysti Ane, for utilizing racial slurs.
 Soon after, Oliver Stark — who performs Evan Buckley, finest pal of Guzman’s character –weighed in to oppose Guzman’s remarks, saying, “there is no excuse for the use of the N-word.” So did Aisha Hinds, who performs firefighter “Hen” on “9-1-1.”
 “How I FEEL daily is a perpetual state of GRIEF. There’s sadly no version of this indefensible discourse that doesn’t exacerbate that grief. There’s legions of learned behaviors that need to be named and neutered so we don’t continue to give life to them. May we know & DO BETTER,” she wrote with regard to Guzman’s statements.
