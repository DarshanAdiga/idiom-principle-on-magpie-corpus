As analysts have posited severally, the revised National Housing Fund Act passed by the National Assembly on February 18th 2019 will, contrary to expectations, make access to housing funds even more inaccessible to low income earners because it taxes the poor more than the rich, especially when the respective Pay As You Earn(PAYE) income tax requirements are weighed against stipulated NHF deductions. Besides, the new Act imposed a 2.5 percent levy on cement which is tantamount to a tax on property development - thus making housing even far less affordable for the poor and vulnerable…

So far, only the 6, 7 and 8 Series rock 5G, and by introducing it to the 4 it will allow them to take 5G capable smartphones to 35 new countries across Africa, Asia, Europe and more. Motorola, OPPO and Xiaomi have all committed to launch 5G smartphones powered by the Snapdragon 4 Series. Finally, they also showed the Snapdragon 8cx Gen 2 for 5G Computing.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Luis Robert’s 458-foot home run capped a second five-run inning of the night for Chicago as the White Sox defeated the Kansas City Royals 11-6 Thursday night.
 Robert was one of three White Sox to homer in the contest, joining Edwin Encarnacion and Tim Anderson.
 “It was a very well-struck ball,” manager Rick Renteria said. “It was a pretty swing, and he got all of it.”
 The White Sox pulled within a half-game of the idle Cleveland Indians for the lead in the American League Central. They lead the third-place Twins by one game.
 Dylan Cease (5-2) picked up the win. He allowed three runs on four hits in five-plus innings. Cease only had one 1-2-3 inning, but he kept the Royals at bay.
 “I don’t think I executed that great,” Cease said. “There was a lot of room to get better.”
 Danny Duffy (2-3) took the loss for Kansas City, and he wasn’t happy about it.
 “Nothing felt physically off in terms of stuff, it’s just that I couldn’t put my fastball where I wanted it today. There will be days like this. I walked five people," Duffy said. "I think I might have doubled my walks this year. The free passes are what really kind of irks me. I’ve worked my butt off the last year to eliminate those. The five in a game is just unacceptable but so is five runs in an inning.”
 The Royals got a run in the first when Hunter Dozier lined one over the wall in left centre.
 The White Sox answered in the second when Encarnacion blasted one 442 feet to left leading off. With one out, Duffy walked Robert, gave up back-to-back singles and walked Tim Anderson to force in a run.
 Anderson, who is a career .300 hitter against the Royals, said familiarity breeds success.
 “Nothing against them. I’m just locked in, I guess. I mean, you face these guys so many times, you kind of know what they want to do or what they’re thinking. For me it’s just being on time.”
 After a wild pitch scored another run, Duffy walked Yasmani Grandal to load the bases again. Jose Abreu doubled off the wall, scoring two more. Alex Gordon’s 101st career outfield assist led to an out at the plate and the end of the inning.
 Anderson extended the lead to 6-1in the fourth with a one-out home run.
 Back to back doubles leading off the bottom of the sixth by Maikel Franco and Alex Gordon ended the night for Cease. Edward Olivarez, making his Royals debut, singled and then Nicky Lopez drove in Gordon and Olivarez with a double to right.
 But the White Sox came storming back scoring five runs off reliever Jake Newberry in the seventh. Newberry faced six batters and five scored. Abreu drove in one with a single and Yoan Moncada drove in another with a sacrifice fly before Robert’s home run.
 The Royals added a couple of runs in the eighth on RBI groundouts.
 TRAINER’S ROOM
 Royals RF/DH Jorge Soler was not in the lineup after coming out of Wednesday’s game with oblique irritation. Manager Mike Matheny said he was pleased with the progress he had made since Wednesday, and listed him as day-to-day.
 ROSTER MOVES
 The Royals recalled OF Edward Olivares from the Royals alternate site. He was acquired in the trade that sent closer Trevor Rosenthal to the Padres. To make room on the roster, LHP Randy Rosario was designated for assignment.
 UP NEXT
 The White Sox will send rookie RHP Dane Dunning (0-0, 2.89 ERA) for his second straight start against the Royals. In his last outing, he threw five hitless innings, allowing only one walk and only one out to leave the infield.
 Brady Singer (1-3, 5.19) will get the start for the Royals. Singer has lost his last two decisions. In his last start, against the White Sox, he took a no-decision when he allowed three runs on five hits in five innings.

Several public health experts pointed out that final stage trials of experimental vaccines are still recruiting, and are at best halfway through that process. The vaccines are two doses, and each is given a month apart. The experts told the AP they did not understand how there could be adequate data on whether the vaccines work and are safe before Nov. 1.
 “Being ready is reasonable. Cutting short phase 3 trials before you get the information you need isn’t,” said Dr. Paul Offit, a Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia immunization expert who sits on the FDA's vaccine advisory committee.
 Peter Hotez, dean of Baylor University's tropical medicine school, said he was “very concerned” about whether the FDA would use an emergency use authorization to approve a vaccine before knowing whether it works and is safe.
 "It gives the appearance of a stunt rather than an expression of public health concern,″ Hotez said.
 FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn previously said the agency wouldn’t cut corners in evaluating vaccines, though it would aim to expedite its work. He told the Financial Times this week that it might be “appropriate” to approve a vaccine before clinical trials were complete if the benefits outweighed the risks.
 Unlike a therapeutic that is given to sick people who may have no alternative, a vaccine is given to healthy people, “so you have a much higher burden of proof,” said Ashish Jha, dean of Brown University's public health school.
 “I think it’s reasonable to be communicating to hospitals and saying — at some point late in the fall or winter," Jha said. “November feels awfully early.”
 Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota infectious disease expert, said he was concerned about an “October surprise” with a vaccine being rushed through ahead of the election.
 “The public health community wants a safe and effective vaccine as much as anybody could want it,” Osterholm said. “But the data have to be clear and compelling.”
 He said there was a “credibility gap” between doctors and the FDA about how rigorously products are being evaluated during the pandemic.
 Some state officials said Wednesday that they were working on next steps while still awaiting details from CDC, and some sounded a cautious note.
 Kris Ehresmann, Minnesota's infectious disease director, told the AP the state would only move forward “once we know it is safe.” She said they would take their lead from the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which she said “will only recommend a vaccine that has met the safety criteria.”
 The Oregon Board of Pharmacy said it would expedite McKesson’s applications but wouldn’t waive requirements necessary to maintain public health and safety. Its executive director, Joe Schnabel, said in a statement that the board didn’t have enough information on how distribution would work “to speculate about whether it will be fully operational by November 1st.”
 The office of Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, said state officials don't know yet what is being asked of them, and will first need to do “an extensive review of the potential benefits or pitfalls of such waivers.”
 New Mexico Human Service Secretary David Scrase said the state was preparing to administer coronavirus vaccines on a limited basis starting in November to health care workers and residents of long-term care facilities. The broad public vaccine roll-out is slated for January. He said current vaccine provider networks are robust and adequate for the COVID-19 effort.
 Regarding the timing of the CDC request to expedite or waive permits for distribution centers to open Nov. 1, Scrase said, “I can’t tell you about the political motivations on that.”
 A spokesman for Tennessee Republican Gov. Bill Lee said the state was reviewing its next steps.
 "News of a vaccine is encouraging and a testament to the power of American innovation,” said the spokesman, Gillum Ferguson.
 And in Florida, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis said he wasn’t aware of the CDC news, but he said people shouldn’t think that the virus will be gone in two months once a vaccine is released.
 “I would hope that the federal government would kind of take the lead on that,” said DeSantis, a Trump ally. "Hopefully they have a plan to do it and will really focus on those vulnerable among us.”
