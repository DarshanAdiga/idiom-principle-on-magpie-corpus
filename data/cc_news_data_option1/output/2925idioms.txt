Pundits are always saying, in a kind of sad, sage, pundity way that Broad’s batting was destroyed by getting hit by the bouncer in Manchester (I was there, by the way, but missed it as we were behind the stands looking for my mate Alan, who was actually in his seat all along). However his batting had already been pretty poor for at least the previous couple of years and the blow only sharpened the decline. If you did a graphical representation of his batting stats, you could chart two points where his performances declined from. 1. The Varun bouncer and 2. The point he realised that his place was safe as a bowler and he didn’t actually need to bother with his batting any more. I’ve always thought this reflected a little badly on him.

BOSTON -- And on the third day, after sessions that ran for a collective 35 hours, the Massachusetts House of Representatives passed a sweeping police reform and accountability bill that seeks to certify all law enforcement officers in the state and curb the use of force tactics by police.
 The bill, representing the House's attempt at addressing calls to counter systemic racism and force changes within law enforcement, largely stayed true to core principals the Black and Latino Legislative Caucus put forward early last month.
 Republicans and a significant number of Democrats opposed the bill, but Democrats who control the House were able to pass it on Friday at 10 p.m. on a 93-66 vote.
 The legislation will likely head next to six-member House-Senate conference committee for resolution, but the bill's negotiators have a short window - seven days - to try to get a consensus bill to Gov. Charlie Baker, who had proposed his own police accountability bill. The Senate approved its bill on a 30-7 vote. Formal legislative sessions, where controversial matters are settled, are set to end for 2020 on Friday, July 31.
 The House bill creates an independent Massachusetts Police Standards and Training Commission that would be responsible for licensing all law enforcement in the state every three years. Members of the commission would have the authority to decertify an officer for misconduct, including bias, conviction of a felony, submission of false timesheets, and use of excessive force.
 "Everybody had to give up something here to get to a common good, right. And sometimes that's where life takes you. So these are moments that are historical and unique, challenging, but these are profile of courage moments," chair of the Black and Latino Legislative Caucus Rep. Carlos Gonzalez told reporters after Friday's session. "Both chambers want to get something across to the governor and get something that can be approved by the governor, but also veto-proof in both chambers."
 The House vote suggests negotiators may need to work with Baker to craft a bill he is willing to sign.
 With the slightly differing versions of police reform passed in both branches, the Legislature has begun to answer at least some of the calls from protestors to address police brutality after the killing of George Floyd while in Minneapolis police custody. For weeks demonstrators gathered by the thousands, showing their support for the Black Lives Matter movement and making it clear that they were seeking strong reforms.
 The bill takes on qualified immunity, an issue that drew contentious debate in the Senate last week, by tying the court-made doctrine in the case of police directly to the licensing process and revoking immunity in any case that results in decertification. The House also proposes creating a commission to study qualified immunity and directs the panel to report findings by March 31, 2020, addressing concerns of police unions that the impact of the doctrine is not widely understood.
 One amendment would have pushed off the effective date of several sections in the bill dealing with qualified immunity until the commission released its final report. The amendment was rejected on a 72-87 vote, with Rep. Bradford Hill (R-Ipswich) arguing that lawmakers should not so quickly approve and implement changes to a "complicated issue" without first studying its ramifications.
 House Speaker Robert DeLeo first pledged to help assemble an omnibus piece of legislation in early June and said his goal was to get the bill to Baker's desk by July 31. The Senate released its bill July 6 and approved it July 14 after overcoming a difficult rollout and a lengthy session with a final vote taking place after 4 a.m.
 DeLeo said the legislation was difficult to discuss and debate but respect was held on both sides.
 "I don't think that people on either side had any anger at the other side," DeLeo told the News Service Friday night. "But having said that I think we wanted to try to get it as right to make sure that everyone had the proper protections, whether it was people Black and Brown or whether it was the members of the police force to make sure that everyone was treated fairly."
 Carol Rose, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Association of Massachusetts, said the bill "does not reflect the fierce urgency that deadly police violence against Black people demands. Instead, it reflects the depth of entrenched opposition to necessary police reform. Police unions and officers used the weapon of fear to maintain the status quo and undermine even very moderate reforms."
 The House bill, if signed into law, "will not help victims of violence hold police accountable," Rose added, calling for an end to qualified immunity and the empowerment of "victims of police violence to seek justice for the harms they have suffered and to hold abusive officers directly accountable."
 Among the various permanent commissions the bill creates, one on the status of African Americans would attempt to help lawmakers create solutions to discrimination and issues facing the Black community. The legislation also bans the use of facial technology, chokeholds, and regulates the use of tear gas and rubber bullets unless officers have no other options to protect public safety.
 A push to completely ban the use of tear gas and other chemical weapons by police officers in the House version failed Thursday after Rep. Mike Connolly's amendment died on a 38-120 vote. Rep. Jack Patrick Lewis publicly supported the amendment comparing the use of such weapons to scenes of the "horrors of war and authoritarian regimes."
 Much of the debate in the House took place behind closed doors and on conference calls and House leaders packed bundles of proposed changes into three consolidated amendments, an approach that limited some public debate. The first dealt with the standards that must be met in order for a preliminary inquiry into an officer's conduct to be launched and for an officer to be certified.
 Under one successful consolidated bundle, the commission could start a preliminary inquiry if it finds "by a preponderance of evidence" that the officer was part of an officer-involved injury or death, committed a felony or misdemeanor or violated state standards. Requirements to decertify an officer remained "by clear and convincing evidence."
 One proposal from Rep. Liz Miranda drew emotional speeches from Democrats and a Republican around the issue of further restricting no-knock warrants. The amendment passed on a 83-76 vote Wednesday and only allows law enforcement officers to use the warrants if they have "no reason to believe that minor children or adults over the age of 65 are in the home."
 Rep. Timothy Whelan, a former State Police trooper, argued that the amendment put law enforcement lives in danger and recounted a situation where he said he would likely have died if a no-knock had not been utilized.
 Prior to the vote, Miranda recalled the death of Breonna Taylor and Ayanna Stanley Jones, both of whom were killed after police entered their households.
 "It could have happened in Massachusetts," Miranda said on the House floor, adding that her amendment "is to save women like me, like Breonna, and girls like Ayanna."

HBT, Squaretek, Quality Quick Print
 It’s a big deal when businesses grow, expand, stretch the limits of their capacity and need to relocate. But with owner, Josh Stewart, it is happening for three of his businesses at the same time.
 General manager Steve Turney said, “It’s going to be much more convenient to have all three of these businesses under one roof.”
 Quality Quick Print, Squaretek and Harrison Battery & Tire (HBT) have all moved to 104 Bluebird Street, off of Hester Drive. The new building is located between RE/MAX Unlimited Realty and the office of ESPN Radio.
 Josh Stewart purchased HBT in 2015, Squaretek in 2016, Ship n Go in 2017 and Quality Quick Print in 2019.
 Turney said, “We are the black and cedar building with plenty of parking and a pad in the back for semi-trucks who need tire repair.”
 “We are so proud of this new space,” Turney said. “Our former location was a 1950s gas station and we just didn’t have any room. We’d remodeled and renovated as much as we could, but just ran out of space. Now we have plenty of parking and a spacious waiting area including a state of the art waiting room with wifi, five televisions, fire place, tech center, snack bar, drink station, and HBT Kids Zone.”
 “We want our customers to be comfortable, enjoy the coffee and snack bar. They can enjoy the fireplace when it’s cold outside and watch TV while they wait.”
 He was very proud of the ladies’ restroom. “We’ve made this very spacious and nice because we want our female customers to feel comfortable coming to a tire shop.”
 Harrison Battery & Tire was the first of the three to open in the new location. The other two will be in operation soon. A grand opening and ribbon cutting with the Harrison Regional Chamber of Commerce is on the schedule for the near future.

ROCKLAND -- When Candace Puopolo and her two friends made it to the peak of New Hampshire's Mount Lafayette after five hours of hiking, they pulled out cheese and crackers - and some Twizzlers - to celebrate.
 The Rockland women had spent their weekend ascending the mountain to raise awareness and money for a Boston-based organization that supports people affected by domestic violence.
 The event, called Wilderness Heals, is a three-day hike in New Hampshire's White Mountains. It has been held for 25 years and typically brings together 50 to 60 women to traverse trails and bond over meals and nights spent camping.
 The hike raises money for the Elizabeth Stone House, an organization that works with adult and child survivors of domestic violence and related trauma to help them find safety, stability, and overall well-being.
 Due to the coronavirus pandemic, this year's hike went virtual, meaning participants hiked at a location of their choice the weekend of July 17. However, Puopolo and her teammates, Amanda Clark and Katie Weeks, decided to head to the original spot.
 It was Puopolo's third time, and Clark and Weeks' first. Puopolo, a personal trainer and competitive power lifter, was affected by domestic violence as a child.
 "I grew up in that environment. There were nights we would have to leave and get hotel rooms," she said. "When I found out about Wilderness Heals, I thought what a great resource it is for women and children to be able to have that in our time of need. It's not something that is everywhere and it should be. Unfortunately more often than not, it's something that's needed."
 Under normal circumstances, hikers are required to raise a minimum of $1,500, but that was waived when the hike went virtual. The three women, with the team name "The Persisters", have raised over $3,100 for the Elizabeth Stone House. They will continue to collect donations through September.
 They all trained together for about a year to prepare for the hike. Depending on the incline, the Wilderness Heals hikes can range from 10 to 30 miles. This year, the trio hiked 12 miles between two days, the second of which took them to the top of the 5,249 foot peak of Mount Lafayette.
 Weeks and Clark were a bit apprehensive because it was their first time, but found the experience to be inspiring.
 "It was very challenging," said Clark. "There's definitely a point where you just keep putting one foot in front of the other to get to the top."
 "It was nice to challenge myself for a good cause," said Weeks. "It was good to have support there because there were times I could have quit."
 After enjoying the journey and mountaintop views with their friend, both Clark and Weeks said they'd absolutely do the hike again next year.
 As of Friday morning, Wilderness Heals raised more than $115,000 of its $250,000 goal. Last year, they raised $230,000 and in all the years the event has been held, the organization has raised more than $3.4 million to support community members impacted by domestic violence.
 "It impacts more people than we know," said Puopolo. "It's one of those things that tends to be swept under the rug because people feel shame about it. We need to be a little more empathetic to those who need that help."
 The event is open to all women, regardless of hiking skill. For more information or to donate, visit elizabethstone.org/wilderness-heals/ or wildernessheals.org.

As the results of the June 9 primary trickled in, Fitz Johnson and Andy Smith kept hitting the “refresh” button on their web browsers.
 “It was like, refresh, refresh, refresh,” Johnson recalled, laughing.
 “It was horrible,” Smith said. After the election, he and his wife took a planned trip to the beach, where they were to unwind after the rigors of his first campaign for public office. “It was the least relaxing vacation I ever had.”
 Johnson, Smith and Kevin Nicholas each ran to succeed retiring Bob Ott, one of five people on the county’s governing board.
 Each finished within 1,000 votes of each other: Johnson earned 6,656 votes to Smith’s 5,945 votes and Nicholas’ 5,770.
 As the top two vote-getters in that Republican primary race, Johnson and Smith will head to the Aug. 11 runoff since no single candidate earned more than 50% of the vote.
 The winner will face Democrat Jerica Richardson in November. Richardson did not face a primary opponent, but managed to garner almost 6,000 more votes — 24,146 — than the three Republican candidates combined.
 Richardson told the MDJ she continues “to be incredibly proud of how committed we are in showing up to make our voices heard.
 “The election results also show how much we desire to have a community bonded with genuine connections. Am I pleased with the results? Of course! However, I know we still have more hard work to do to claim victory this coming November. There are more people to empower, and every day has presented new challenges for everyone to consider. It is in this climate that we have the unique opportunity to envision the Cobb we desire to create with real empathy. As the front-runner, I am happy and honored to be a part of Cobb’s story.”
 When asked whether he was concerned with the number of votes Richardson earned, Johnson said he was focused on the runoff.
 In a statement posted to his Facebook page, Nicholas thanked his supporters.
 “While we fell short by less than 1% of votes cast, I am proud of the grass roots campaign we ran — representing ourselves and our neighbors, no special interests,” wrote Nicholas. “In these unprecedented times, I am not fully confident in the accuracy of the results but I will continue to put our community first both in my actions and in my prayers.”
 District 2 encompasses parts of east Cobb, Cumberland, Vinings and Smyrna. It has been under Ott’s representation since he was first elected to the role in 2008.
 Those who’ve kept an eye on the race said they were not surprised by how close the votes were between candidates.
 Ott, who did not make an endorsement in the primary, said the result is not uncommon when there are several “relatively unknown” candidates running for an open seat.
 Cobb GOP Chairman Jason Shepherd agreed.
 “We had three just really amazing candidates,” Shepherd said. “It’s rare when you hear from people that they like all the candidates and don’t know which one to go for.”
 Johnson and Smith’s challenge now, he said, is to do more to distinguish themselves from each other and reach outside their communities in which they did well.
 “Fitz is more from the south side of the district, living in the Smyrna/Vinings area, while Andy is from the more northern, east Cobb portion,” he said. “Both need to do outreach into each other’s territories.”
 Smith agrees.
 “I knew from early that … I hadn’t done well in some of the Smyrna precincts and Vinings,” he said. ”I think there are a lot of people there that would be receptive to my message, so I just got to get out to them.”
 The coronavirus probably didn’t help, Ott said.
 Qualifying for the race ended in the first week of March; by the end of the month, the state had effectively gone into a lockdown to limit the virus’s spread.
 Limiting in-person interaction meant mailers, yard signs and websites did most of the campaigns’ heavy lifting, Ott added.
 Smith credits his advancement to the runoff in part because of his experience serving on the Planning and Neighborhood Safety commissions and the Transit Advisory Board. Although Nicholas currently serves on the Development Authority of Cobb County, Smith added, the Planning Commission is “much closer to what a commissioner is spending the majority of his time on.”
 Asked what contributed to his victory, Johnson said, “It’s really just a lot of hard work.”
 The retired businessman was out of commission for a month after catching the coronavirus, which meant a lot of phone calls and emails, he said.
 Smith will prove a formidable challenger in the runoff, Johnson added.
 “He’s a good guy, there’s no doubt about it,” Johnson said. “He wouldn’t be where he is today without being a good guy and a hard worker.”
 Johnson has proved a prolific fundraiser, having received a total of $73,125 in campaign contributions as of his most recent campaign finance disclosures.
 Smith and Nicholas raised far less, at $43,845 and $24,750 apiece.
 Johnson’s fundraising prowess is even more impressive after accounting for candidate’s contributions to their own campaigns.
 Johnson contributed just over $10,000 to his own money to his campaign. Nicholas loaned himself twice that; Smith, three times that.
 Johnson’s contributors include a number of senior executives at Wellstar Health System, including executive vice president Leo Reichert, chief financial officer James Budzinski and Kennestone head Mary Chatman. He has also received donations from people in the upper echelons of the county’s business community, such as Jim Rhoden, chairman of Futren Hospitality, and Eric Widner, operations manager at Loud Security.
 Cobb GOP chairman Jason Shepherd said there is a perception among some of Johnson as a candidate favored by the Cobb Chamber of Commerce, which could prove a double-edged sword.
 Among the most conservative in the Republican Party, chambers of commerce are seen as occasionally pushing big-government solutions to problems. Shepherd cited the state chamber’s support for mass transit and opposition to “religious freedom” bills as stances that have alienated die-hard conservatives.
 On the other hand, it could give Johnson an edge among those who value business acumen and job creation above all else.
 “That’s not to say that Andy, having served on a number of boards, that he’s any less friendly to business,” Shepherd said.
 Such “whisper campaigns” among party activists can become more consequential in a primary runoff when only the most engaged voters care enough to turn out, Shepherd added.
 Ott, for his part, said he would not get involved in the primary. He has known both men a long time. He and Smith graduated from the same high school, and he appointed Smith to the Cobb Planning Commission. Johnson, meanwhile, was Ott’s class leader when the latter was at Leadership Cobb.
 Ott did say, however, that he wanted the next District 2 commissioner to continue the legacy left by himself and his predecessor, the late Joe Lee Thompson. By the time Ott retires at the end of this year, the two will have served a combined 28 consecutive years as the district’s representative.
 That legacy includes the explosion of business in the Cumberland area.
 “What’s most important to me is that what he started and I continued, that all of that continues,” he said. “I think the district’s doing well, we got a lot of great things that are happening in the list, it’s the economic engine of the county.”
 Whoever comes out on top in the Aug. 11 runoff, Ott and Shepherd said the people of District 2 will win.
 “I’m glad I don’t live in that district and don’t have to make a decision, because I think the world of both of them,” Shepherd said.
