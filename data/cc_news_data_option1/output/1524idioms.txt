For their Droop commercials, the eight queens must come up with high-end products to advertise, making this much like the _All Stars 2_ commercial challenge that Alaska and Katya won. Jackie and Crystal both go with bizarre hair products, as Jackie sells merkins and Crystal finally leans into Ru’s obsessive love of her hair with a Magic Mullet. Crystal’s manic ad is reminiscent of Katya’s winning effort, or even more recently, Divina de Campo’s strong-if-complicated water bottle advertisement from _Drag Race UK_. Jackie goes with 60s _I Dream of Jeannie_ –inspired ad, and while it takes the Pit Crew and director Bob Harper a minute to get on board with her idea, they finally understand her vision.

With Atletico Nacional not playing in mid-week, Cali moved within six points of the pacesetters - although they should have made a much more significant divot in the margin, as they led for the majority of their encounter at home to Boyaca. Lucas Scaglia had Cali ahead on 17 minutes and, despite seeing Andres Perez handed his marching orders shortly after half- time, the hosts looked set to hold onto their one-goal advantage. But there would be heartbreak for the home fans, as Boyaca were…

While the others all do well, Heidi’s is a decisive win. Her advertisement is killer, as she promotes a hydrating serum made of her own tears. Her comic timing finally shines through in the challenge, thanks to an immensely helpful tip from Bob Harper as he advises her to be her normally funny self instead of trying to perform while shooting the ad. I’ve compared Heidi to Alyssa Edwards in the past, and I think this note only furthers that comparison: They’re both funniest when they’re being themselves, not trying to adhere to a tight script. Combined with Heidi’s best runway look yet, and it all makes for a decisive win for Madame Closet.

Jan packs everything you can possibly imagine into her advertisement—in _Untucked_ , she rightfully notes she found room for everything but the kitchen sink. There’s comedy! There’s her in multiple looks! There’s a death drop! And this is all for…a spray. One that barely gets featured, mind you, since the ad is really all about Jan being Jan. Bob Harper repeatedly advises Jan to calm down and be less intense, but I don’t think such a thing is possible. Going 110 miles per hour is Jan’s _thing_ , and it translates pretty terribly in this challenge.

Jaida, like both Jackie and Crystal, stuns on the runway—but I’d be repeating myself if I said that for everyone. Seriously, this is one of the best runways in _Drag Race_ herstory, every look is so strong.

Musk is no stranger to controversies with the media, and having gone through significant pains over the years because of them, he must handle the ongoing attempts to provoke him with extreme caution. At this point, Musk's critics (and apparently, CNN staff) are practically salivating at the prospect of the CEO firing off a tweet that can be interpreted as a direct act of aggression against the news outlet or any of its staff. So far, Musk's responses have been sarcastic, and that's fine and true to his personality. But the Tesla CEO must be aware that he is not playing a fair game here. Every point of syntax and semantics can and will be exploited to fit a narrative, even if it means twisting the context of a statement. With this in mind, Musk's best strategy for now is to proceed with a ton of caution, or complete silence.

A key thesis against Musk alleges that he lied about ventilator donations to get some free PR and goodwill. This does not hold water, as Tesla and Musk already receive an insane amount of media coverage, and the company is scrutinized consistently by the media and critics from Wall Street. Thus, the idea of Musk wanting _more_ media coverage to stroke his ego does not seem to make sense, considering that he and his companies actually get a little bit _too much_ coverage. With this in mind, it appears that CNN's recent reports about Tesla's ventilator donations, as well as the succeeding tweets from the media outlet's staff doubling down on their narrative, are designed to do one thing. They are posted to provoke Musk, until such a time when he actually responds with something concretely controversial.

But nobody was talking about a potential title bid, apparently.
 “We didn’t get carried away. We just kept digging and getting results,” said Allen.
 “It was such a good side and the one-touch football was exceptional. We’d do it in training and it would come out in matches.
 “We’d score goals, going from one end of the pitch to the other, without the other team getting a touch.”
 Allen finished with 27 goals in all copmetitions, striking up a great partnership with Bobby Smith as Spurs safely navigated their way through the FA Cup, beating Sunderland 5-0 in a quarter-final replay after a 1-1 draw at Roker Park, then Burnley 3-0 in the semi-finals to book a final date with Leicester.
 But not many were thinking of becoming the first side since Aston Villa in 1897 to complete a Double.
 “Bobby Smith would unsettle a few. He was a very good player, a strong guy who didn’t stand any nonsence,” added Allen.
 “Like all cup games you can get knocked out, but we went through quite easy. But it never got to that stage. If I’d known, I’d have put a few bob on it!”
 With their league winner’s medals already secured, the grand day out at Wembley Stadium was almost one game too many for the champions.
 But goals in the final quarter of the match from Smith and Terry Dyson secured a 2-0 win and a place in Tottenham folklore forever.
 “The final was one of the only games we never played well in,” said Allen.
 “It wasn’t a great game to watch we were told, compared to how we’d played. But they can’t take that away.
 “It was a big thing and I was fortunate to play there again with QPR and win the League Cup.”
 All great teams need great managers and the 1960-61 Tottenham vintage certainly had one in the legendary Nicholson.
 A league champion in 1951, he would enjoy a 36-year association with the Lilywhites, winning eight trophies in 16 years as manager, and this was his finest hour.
 “He was more advanced in management than others,” said Allen.
 “Training was always interesting and different. Others tried to follow him in the following years. He varied it a lot which was nice.
 “They were the best bunch of lads for joking. One or two of them smoked and we’d take the mick out of them. It was 100 per cent a group. We were a team with good players.
 “He’d tell you what he thought, always picking you up on what you didn’t do and what you did do.
 “He was hard at times and kept you on your toes, but he did well. I think the night we won the league was the only time he really enjoyed himself.
 “I couldn’t have been in a better team and the results proved it. Bill Nic, when I left to join QPR, we played Spurs at home and he was chatting to me after the game and said ‘I only made one mistake with you and that was I got rid of you two years too early!”
 Allen, who saw son Clive and nephew Paul go on to represent the club in their own distinguished ways, was invited back to say goodbye to the old ground, along with many other former greats and legends, and is excited by what the club’s new home might hold in store.
 “I managed to get there and had a good day. There’s only a few of us left unfortunately,” he said, referring to the fact only seven of the 17 players useds in the Double season survive to this day.
 “I went to see the new stadium when it was half up. It’s quite outstanwding and will be great for them in the future.”
 Les Allen certainly played a great part in Tottenham’s past.

Clarke's men have scored just once in their opening four Premier League game, which came last Saturday as Gareth McAuley clinched a 92nd-minute equaliser in a 1-1 draw at Fulham.
 And with all eyes fixed on former Chelsea, Manchester City, Arsenal and Real Madrid striker Anelka - who signed on a one-year deal in July - manager Clarke does not feel like the finger should be pointed at the 34-year-old as West Brom prepare to face Sunderland on Saturday.
 "Nicolas Anelka's form has been, by and large, good – he's been ok," he told the club's official website.
 "He's brought a different dimension to the team.
 "Regardless, I think it's wrong that people single out Nicolas as a name.
 "He's part of a team that has struggled to create chances.
 "But it's not just about Nicolas creating or scoring goals – everyone has to chip in.
 "When you're a star – Nicolas is a star in the world of football – you will grab the headlines.
 "But football is a team game. we're delighted Nicolas is here, we're delighted he’s raised the profile of the club but it’s everyone's job to do well and create chances and score."

The 29-year-old moved to the Hawthorns in a club-record deal on transfer deadline day and took just 20 minutes to open his goalscoring account against his former employers, on the way to helping West Brom to a 3-0 win.
 Sessegnon, who scored 17 goals in 87 appearances for Sunderland, volleyed home after Nicolas Anelka had been denied by goalkeeper Keiren Westwood, but he decided not celebrate his debut strike.
 "I don’t know if it was inevitable," Clarke said. "But you know that if you play somebody against their former club and their job is to create chances and score goals then there is a strong possibility that will happen.
 "He did what we brought him here to do. He is clever on the ball, bright, an entertainer and has goals in him too. It was a very pleasing debut for him.
 "I think he showed good respect to the Sunderland fans. They loved him as a player and in his own way he is an engaging character.
 "He decided not to celebrate so that’s fine with me. If he wants us to celebrate more than him, I'd be happy with that every week."
 Morgan Amalfitano secured the three points in injury time with his first West Brom goal, after Liam Ridgewell had struck in the 76th minute, and Clarke was delighted with the Frenchman's overall contribution.
 "I said when we brought Morgan to the club that he might surprise one or two people," the 50-year-old added.
 "One of the reasons we brought him in was because his assists record in the French league is good and he had a hand in both goals today, especially the second.
 "And he got the added bonus of scoring at the end too. I'm pleased because to have a home debut like that is really good and I hope he can live up to it in the future."

 Lucas Scaglia had Cali ahead on 17 minutes and, despite seeing Andres Perez handed his marching orders shortly after half-time, the hosts looked set to hold onto their one-goal advantage.
 But there would be heartbreak for the home fans, as Boyaca were awarded a late penalty - converted by Gonzalo Martinez - before Faryd Mondragon was dismissed to leave Cali with just nine players on the park at the final whistle.
 Cali are second on 19 points but have also played two more games than leaders Atletico.
 Two points back from Cali are Millonarios, Santa Fe and Junior - with the latter of that trio the only to win on Thursday.
 Junior accounted for Deportes Quindio 3-0 at home, with Samuel Vanegas, Luis Ruiz and Edwin Cardona all on target.
 They remain in fifth spot though, with inferior goal difference but Santa Fe were held to a 1-1 draw on the road at La Equidad.
 A 90th-minute own-goal from Boyaca Chico's Diego Chica handed Alianza Petrolera a 2-1 away win.
 Mid-table Medellin chalked up a 4-0 win over Atletico Huila, with Andres Mosquera, Cleider Alzate, Marcos Perez and Amilcar Henriquez all netting in the first half.
 Envigado are unbeaten in four league outings, after a 2-0 success at home to Cucuta Deportivo.
