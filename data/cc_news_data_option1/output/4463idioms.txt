Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) will take on Mumbai Indians (MI) in the final league-stage game on Tuesday and former West Indies skipper Brian Lara feels that the David Warner-led side has enough firepower to defeat the defending champions. While SRH will need nothing but a win to stake a claim in the top four, MI have already sealed a top spot and will play the Qualifier one. In a must-win match, SRH will be eager to come out all guns blazing. The former cricketer Lara feels Mumbai may rest some of their players which will eventually favour SRH.

Instead of taking a risk on a woman or person of color, party leaders and primary voters may prefer a White, male candidate whose prospects for success feel more certain. That’s strategic discrimination—and it shapes who is able to become a viable candidate and who appears on the ballot on Election Day. This matters because women and people of color remain underrepresented in politics.

WASHINGTON (AP) - Control of the Senate is a razor-close proposition in Tuesday’s election, as Republicans fight to retain their majority against a surge of Democratic candidates confronting the president’s allies across a vast political map. Both parties see paths to victory, and the outcome might not be known on election night.From New England to the Deep South, the Midwest to the Mountain West, Republican senators are defending seats in states once considered long shots for Democrats. Washington’s handling of the COVID-19 crisis, the economic fallout and the nation’s uneasy mood are all on the ballot. Stunning amounts of cash have been flowing to Democrats from millions of Americans apparently voting with their pocketbooks; Republicans are tapping deep-pocketed donors to shore up GOP senators.President Donald Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden swooped in on key states important to the Senate as they propelled their own campaigns in a final stretch. Securing the Senate majority will be vital for the winner of the presidency. Senators confirm administration nominees, including the Cabinet, and can propel or stall the White House agenda. With Republicans now controlling the chamber, 53-47, three or four seats will determine party control, depending on who wins the presidency because the vice president can break a tie.“Let’s run through the tape,” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, making a final campaign swing Monday in Kentucky as he faces Democratic former fighter pilot Amy McGrath.McConnell said he hoped to remain the Republican majority leader alongside Trump. But he acknowledged the tough Senate races could flip control to the Democrats. “Obviously, that depends on what happens,” he said.The campaigns are competing across an expansive Senate map as Democrats put Republicans on defense deep into Trump country.What started as a lopsided election cycle with Republicans defending 23 Senate seats, compared with 12 for Democrats, quickly became a starker referendum on the president and his party.Some of the nation’s most well-known senators are in the fights of their political lives.In South Carolina, Democrat Jaime Harrison is trying to topple GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham, one of the president’s top allies. The two crisscrossed the state in a rush of final campaigning, Graham acknowledging the tight contest after Harrison raised a whopping $100 million by October, an unheard-of sum for the state. The senator, making TV appeals for cash, said he, too, hit the $100 million mark over the weekend.Stuck in Washington to confirm Trump’s Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett a week before Election Day, senators quickly fanned out — some alongside the president — for last-ditch tours, often socially distanced in the pandemic, to shore up votes.GOP Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina joined Trump’s rally in Fayetteville on Monday as he struggled to fend off Democrat Cal Cunningham despite the married challenger’s sexting scandal with a public relations strategist.In one of the most-watched races in the nation, Maine GOP Sen. Susan Collins made a final campaign stop in Aroostook County near her hometown, visiting workers in a sawmill. Democratic challenger Sara Gideon met voters at the Whistle Stop cafe for breakfast Monday. The Maine race is one of several that could push past Election Day if no candidate breaks the 50% threshold. Collins has typically rallied support as a centrist with an independent streak, but the tight contest shows the difficulty GOP senators have appealing to Trump’s most ardent backers while also retaining support from more moderate voters.Democrats have more than one route to secure the three or four seats needed to capture the majority, and GOP strategists privately conceded the incumbents will almost certainly suffer defeats in some key races.Younger voters and more minorities are pushing some states toward Democrats. In Colorado, the parties have essentially stopped spending money for or against GOP Sen. Cory Gardner because it seems he is heading toward defeat by Democrat John Hickenlooper, a former governor.Arizona could see two Democratic senators for the first time since last century if former astronaut Mark Kelly maintains his advantage over GOP Sen. Martha McSally for the seat once held by the late Republican John McCain.Even the open seat in Kansas, which hasn’t elected a Democrat to the Senate since 1932, is being contested.“The better President Trump does in a state, the easier it is to win any race,” said Corry Bliss, a GOP strategist. The biggest risks to Democrats come in Alabama and Michigan.Republicans are expecting to reclaim the seat in Alabama, where Democratic Sen. Doug Jones pulled off a rare 2017 special election win in the Trump stronghold but now wages an uphill campaign against Republican Tommy Tuberville, a former Auburn football coach.In the presidential battleground of Michigan, Republicans have made an aggressive push for John James, a Black Republican businessman, as he rakes in cash to take on Democratic Sen. Gary Peters.“We think the numbers are moving,” said Senate Leadership Fund president Steven Law.Still, voter turnout during the COVID-19 crisis remains key, and volatile, as more Americans than ever — nearing 100 million — cast early ballots.Both Biden and Trump touched down in Georgia, where the state is seeing a boost of new voters. Georgia’s two Senate seats are at stake and could very well push to a Jan. 5 runoff if no candidate reaches beyond the 50% threshold. GOP Sen. David Perdue, the former business executive Trump calls his favorite senator, is working to fend off Democrat Jon Ossoff, another candidate who has benefited from the “green wave” of donations.Separately, GOP Sen. Kelly Loeffler faces Republican Rep. Doug Collins, as well as Democrat Raphael Warnock, in a special election for the seat she was appointed to fill with the retirement of GOP Sen. Johnny Isakson.It’s expected to be a long count in races across the country. The political landscape is quickly changing from six years ago, when most of these senators last faced voters. It’s a reminder of how sharply the political climate has shifted in the Trump era.In Montana, Republican Sen. Steve Daines is trying to brush back Democrat Steve Bullock, the governor, in a state where Trump was popular. Democrats created an opening by working hard to recruit a well-known candidate in Bullock, who also ran in the party’s primary for president.Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst is fighting for a second term against Democrat Theresa Greenfield. Texas Sen. John Cornyn faces an upstart Democrat, MJ Hegar, in the once solidly Republican state.And in Alaska, newcomer Al Gross, a doctor, has broken state fundraising records in part with viral campaign ads as he challenges GOP Sen. Dan Sullivan.___Associated Press writers Mary Clare Jalonick and Alan Fram in Washington contributed to this report.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Shafali Verma Velocity Entering as one of the most exciting player of the tournament, Shafali Verma will be expected to do all the heavy lifting for Velocity. The 16 year old superstar is the youngest women to play for India in T20Is. The opposition will be cautious about Shafali rsquo s form after she was declared the world No. 1 batswoman in the ICC Women rsquo s T20I Player Rankings released in March this year. Verma showcased her mettle at the Women s T20 World Cup 2020 as she emerged as the fifth highest run scorer of the tournament and the player with the highest number of six rsquo s. With such great potential, we could expect a similar showing in Sharjah. Jemimah Rodrigues Supernovas Jemi, as her team mates usually call her, has turned out to be the most explosive player from the Indian Women rsquo s cricket team. The 20 year old talented cricketer from Mumbai was named the player of the series and the player with the highest number of runs during the Women rsquo s T20 Challenge 2019. She grabbed attention at the Women s T20 World Cup 2020, scoring 85 runs in the tournament with a strike rate of 88.54. Jemimah will be an important cog in the wheel for Supernovas, who are eyeing a third consecutive title. Harmanpreet Kaur Supernovas Harmanpreet Kaur has been the most successful player in the tournament and this time, she returns eager to pocket her third title. The experienced all rounder rsquo s career has been decorated with smashing records. She was the first woman to score a century in a women rsquo s T20I, and she was the first Indian player male and female to play 100 T20I matches. Though her performance at the Women rsquo s T20 World Cup was a bit underwhelming, the skipper is all set to change that and saunter onto the Sharjah Cricket Stadium with renewed energy and fervour. Smriti Mandhana Trailblazers The youngest captain of Women rsquo s T20 Challenge, Smriti Mandhana, will be itching to avenge her team showing from last year. The Trailblazers captain did not have a good start of the year as she underperformed at the Women rsquo s T20 World Cup 2020 with just 49 runs in 4 innings. The stylish left handed batswoman will be expected to regain her lost form and improve her batting that will hold the Trailblazers in good stead in the tournament. TOP 5 FOREIGN PLAYERS TO WATCH OUT FOR Chamari Atapattu Supernovas The current captain of Sri Lanka rsquo s women rsquo s T20 international team, Chamari Atapattu is all set to grab eyeballs in the upcoming Women rsquo s T20 Challenge. With a strike rate of 135.08, Chamari became the 6th highest run scorer in the 2020 Women rsquo s T20 World Cup and will be itching to replicate her performance for the Supernovas in their bid to defend the title. The 30 year old batswoman, who has scored 1646 runs in 85 T20Is, has the potential to exploit the batting friendly conditions in Sharjah. Her wealth of experience too will come handy for decision making processes on the field of play. Sophie Ecclestone Trailblazers The stakes are high for Smriti Mandhana rsquo s Trailblazers as the world No. 1 bowler in Women s T20 cricket joins the team for their 2020 campaign. The 21 year old England spinner dished out her career best performance at the Women rsquo s T20 World Cup with a stingy economy rate of 3.23 at the expense of just 15.1 overs. Considering all the matches will be held in Sharjah, Sophie will play a key role for the Trailblazers to prevent the opposition from posting a high score. Deandra Dottin Trailblazers Looking at the dimensions of the Sharjah Cricket Stadium, Deandra Dottin will be raring to send the cricket ball out of the park. The West Indies all rounder, the first female cricketer to hit 100 sixes in WT20Is, enters the fray riding high on confidence, especially after moving five places to reach 15th position in the latest Women rsquo s T20I Rankings announced recently. With her brute force, Dottin could prove to be the backbone of the team rsquo s lower order. Danielle Wyatt Velocity Danielle Wyatt brings the necessary experience that Mithali Raj rsquo s Velocity needs. Throughout her career, the English all rounder has been impressive with both bat and ball but has been facing some issues in the past few tournaments. At the Women rsquo s T20 World Cup, Wyatt notched up 42 runs in four innings, with an average of 11.75 and a strike rate of 102.17. The Women rsquo s T20 Challenge will be a chance for her to renew herself and show the might that she possesses. Natthakan Chantham Trailblazers Making her debut in the Women rsquo s T20 Challenge is the first ever Thai cricketer ndash Natthakan Chantham. The cricketer has turned heads and put Thailand on the world cricket map. She became the first ever cricketer to register a half century in T20 World Cup for her country. Chantham has been impressive with the bat, accumulating 103 runs in just four innings with a strike rate of 83.73 and an average of 25.75. With her addition, Trailblazers have surely beefed up their batting contingent Squads Supernovas Harmanpreet Kaur C , Jemimah Rodrigues VC , Chamari Atapattu, Priya Punia, Anuja Patil, Radha Yadav, Taniya Bhatia WK , Shashikala Siriwardene, Poonam Yadav, Shakera Selman, Arundhati Reddy, Pooja Vastrakar, Ayushi Soni, Ayabonga Khaka, Muskan Malik Trailblazers Smriti Mandhana C , Deepti Sharma VC , Punam Raut, Richa Ghosh, D.

Today, voters will go to the polls across Wisconsin in what may be remembered as the weirdest election in American history, complicated by a global pandemic and fierce races including partisan arguments over what should or should not count as legitimate ballots.
 And, of course, hundreds of thousands of Wisconsinites—and millions of Americans around the country—already have voted by mail or early balloting.
 What could go wrong?
 At the center of sorting out any questions that could arise is something called the Wisconsin Elections Commission. Government junkies will recall the commission replaced the Government Accountability Board which used to oversee such matters. The nonpartisan GAB—overseen by retired judges—was replaced by the partisan commission (and a separate partisan ethics board) because majority Republican legislators were in a snit about recall elections after the ugly disputes over Act 10.
 Now the Wisconsin Elections Commission comprises six partisan members—three Republicans and three Democrats. They are appointed by the party leaders and, yes, they do their jobs in partisan lockstep more often than not.
 The Wisconsin Center for Investigative Reporting recently documented the serious problems that can cause for county and municipal clerks who are at the pointy end of trying to make elections work. It seems a number of big questions that go before the elections commission gum up in the predictable 3-3 partisan split, leaving clerks largely to fend for themselves.
 Isn’t that a comforting thought as Wisconsin comes face to face with today’s complex general election?
 Maybe there will be no problems. We certainly hope that’s the case.
 Hope, however, is not a strategy. A commission split 3-3 along partisan lines could end up being nothing but a political boulder.
 When the election fog clears, Wisconsin should face the need for deep political reform. It’s not just partisan gridlock with election and ethics boards. It’s gerrymandering. It’s the overpoliticized Supreme Court. It’s balance of power issues and legislative overreach in stripping the executive branch of duties. And more.
 There was a time when Wisconsin was considered a national model for easing partisan pressures through such means as having nonpartisan retired judges preside over the accountability board. Now, Wisconsin is considered one of America’s most divided, polarized, dysfunctional states.
 There is no reason to trust the politicians who created this mess to fix it. Why would they?
 We continue to believe a constitutional amendment is needed that would allow the people to petition and place binding referendums on statewide ballots with the power to override the political class. Maybe fear would motivate partisans to behave more responsibly.

To add insult to injury, Karlee felt like her mother’s death was reported as if she was being judged on her worst day. It was inaccurately reported that she was homeless, an unflattering mugshot ran with the story and while Karen Bodine did struggle with drug abuse, Karlee said the report only gave people a reason not to care about her death.
 “It really victim shamed her, and it made people not care about the case,” Karlee Bodine said.
 Karlee Bodine was in high school when her mother was killed, and since then, has tried to develop ways to raise awareness around her case with hope that someone with relevant information will come forward.
 Her billboard which was put up last Tuesday is the product of just one of her efforts to keep her mother’s case in Olympia citizens’ peripheral vision.
 But in recent years Karlee Bodine realized she isn’t just looking for someone locally who might have information, she is also reaching out to true-crime fanatics who might take an interest in the case and help crack it.
 “The term ‘armchair detective’ is really catching on and people are really interested in that type of stuff,” Karlee Bodine said. “Especially if it is a local case or someone they might have known, something that really draws them in.”
 Admittedly, Karlee Bodine is an avid consumer of true-crime content — and she was a fan of true-crime long before her mother’s death.

MADRID, Nov 3 (Reuters) - International tourist arrivals to Spain fell 87% year-on-year in September, data showed on Tuesday, as coronavirus restrictions and a rapid rise in cases put many off visiting.
 After a disastrous summer season, when few visitors came despite the lifting of lockdowns, many had hoped the stricken tourist sector, which normally accounts for 12% of economic output, would improve in September.
 But September's year-on-year fall was even steeper than the 76% drop recorded in August, while tourists spent 90% less in September than in the same month a year ago.
 Over the first nine months of the year, some 16.8 million foreign tourists visited Spain, around 75% fewer than in the same period of 2019, the National Statistics Institute (INE) said.
 France now accounts for the largest group of foreign tourists after the number of Britons - who last year made up a fifth of international visitors - plunged 81% between January and September.
 Still, officials in the Canary Islands were optimistic that some of the winter season there could be salvaged after Germany and Britain removed travel restrictions to the archipelago
 While Spain's gross domestic product rebounded in the third quarter, the economy was still 8.7% smaller than a year ago.

Sangeet Som, the BJP MLA from Sardhana in Meerut, has asked the Hindu youth to awaken and follow the tit for tat policy on the love jihad issue. He asked the Hindu youth not to wait for the police or law to take action. You must teach the love jihadis a lesson. The police and the law will take its own course and we cannot wait endlessly for this. Danda uthao ya joota pick up a rod or a shoe but teach them a lesson, he said. In an interaction on the social media with his voters, the MLA said, It is up to the Hindus to protect their daughters and sisters. Som also targeted the Congress and the Samajwadi Party for their silence on the Nikita case. It is only because the accused belong to a particular community and these parties do not want to lose their votes, he said. The MLA welcomed the Allahabad High Court decision which said that conversion only for the sake of marriage was unacceptable. Sangeet Som, known as a firebrand Hindu leader, has always been in news for his controversial pro Hindu statements.

A salvage operation is under way to lift a runaway train off a sculpture of a whale’s tail, where it landed after ploughing through the end of an elevated section of track.
 The train was left precariously balanced on the whale’s tail sculpture 10 metres above the ground on Monday, after plunging off the end of a metro line in Spijkenisse, a town on the southern edge of Rotterdam.
 The train was empty at the time and the driver escaped unhurt, thanks to the whale tail’s unlikely catch.
 Two large yellow cranes are working in tandem, looping a cable around the front of the train as the operation began.
 The local security authority said it will probably be lifted off the sculpture in the afternoon. It said the driver was interviewed by police on Monday as part of the investigation into the cause of the crash and allowed to go home.

Ant declined to comment. CBIRC and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange did not immediately respond to faxed requests for comment. The PBOC and CSRC were unable to be reached by phone outside of business hours.
 China's central bank and banking regulator separately published draft micro- lending rules on Monday which seek to increase the bar for micro-lenders to be able to provide online loans directly to consumers or jointly with banks, while limiting the amount they can lend.
 The draft, open for public feedback until Dec. 2, requires small online lenders to provide at least 30per cent of any loan they fund jointly with banks, which is widely considered to be a key rule that will hurt the profitability of Ant's current business model.
 Only 2per cent of the 1.7 trillion yuan consumer loans Ant facilitated were on its balance sheet as of the end of June, its prospectus showed. The company takes an average 30per cent-40per cent cut of the interest on loans it facilitates, analysts estimate, without bearing such products' credit risks.
 Ant is set to go public in Hong Kong and Shanghai on Thursday after raising about US$37 billion, including the greenshoe option of the domestic leg, in a record public sale of shares.
 The latest regulatory move will likely cast a cloud over Ant's post-debut performance, warned the sources and some institutional investors in its IPO.
 "One tree far taller than others may fall victim to a strong wind more easily," said the second source.

That will change on Saturday when David Moyes’ side host Fulham at London Stadium. Scott Parker’s side picked up their first win of the season as they saw off West Brom 2-0 at Craven Cottage.
 Much like when Jarrod Bowen joined West Ham back in January, Moyes has been patient with a former Championship player and eased him into action. Granted, Bowen got more minutes against Man City and Liverpool in his first two appearances before his first start compared to Benrahma.
 Bowen made his full debut at home to a then struggling Southampton side. Quarter of an hour into his first start, Bowen had scored and had put the Hammers on their way to a 3-1 victory that hauled them out of the relegation zone. At the time, that was West Ham’s first victory in two months.
 There are plenty of parallels between Bowen and Benrahma and the start of their Hammers career. Though Benrahma wasn’t involved against Man City, Pep Guardiola’s side and Liverpool were his first two fixtures. Bowen was the same.

Nov 3 (Reuters) - If U.S. President Donald Trump secures a second term in the White House, look for an auto emissions battle with California, a bid to downsize Big Tech and more strong audience ratings for cable news.
 Here is how a re-election of President Trump could impact six key industries. For a FACTBOX on how these sectors might change if former Vice President Joe Biden wins the election, click.
 AUTOMAKERS
 A Trump re-election would leave U.S. automakers caught in the crossfire of a war over climate policy between Washington and the state of California.
 California sued Trump for rolling back national vehicle emissions standards and seeking to cancel the state's authority to mandate sales of electric vehicles.
 Automakers stand to save billions in compliance costs under Trump's emissions approach. But the clash with California over emissions and electric vehicles has divided automakers. It has also left the industry to deal with two sets of regulations for the increasingly divergent coastal Blue state markets and heartland, Red state markets. Automakers have long advocated resolving differences between California and federal climate policy to create a single, national set of standards to guide their technology investments.
 During his first term, Trump put pressure on Detroit automakers to step up investments in the United States, attacking General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co for decisions to close plants, or invest in China and Mexico. Trump periodically threatened German automakers with tariffs. His steel and aluminum tariffs raised costs for U.S. automakers.
 PHARMACEUTICALS
 Trump has been a vocal critic of high drug prices but experts say the pharmaceutical industry will likely fare better under a Trump second term than they would if Joe Biden wins the White House.
 Trump passed a number of executive orders designed to slash drug prices in his first term but experts say they have had little practical impact.
 His efforts to spur Congress to pass new laws to reduce drug costs have been much less successful, in part because his own party blocked a bill that would have allowed Medicare, a government health insurance program, to negotiate lower drug prices with pharmaceutical companies.
 MINING
 Trump, should he win re-election, is expected to continue to slash mining industry regulations and shorten the permitting process, part of a wide- ranging effort to boost domestic production of the minerals used to make electronics, weapons and a host of other goods.
 Trump signed several executive orders in his first term that labeled rare earths and other minerals as critical to national defense, ordering the Pentagon to financially support junior projects. The U.S. only has one rare earths mine, though it relies on China for processing. A second Trump term could see multiple new domestic rare earth mines as well as new processing equipment from Rare Element Resources Ltd and others.
 At least one mining project could be jeopardized in Trump's new term, however. Alaska's Pebble Mine project, a massive copper and gold deposit in the Bristol Bay watershed, has come under criticism by Trump's son Donald Trump Jr. and Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who have said the mine would destroy areas where they enjoy fishing and hunting. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in late August extended its permit review timeline out past the election, a step that came after both privately lobbied the president.
 The mine's developer, Vancouver-based Northern Dynasty Minerals Ltd, has said the mine can be safely developed. But Alaska's two U.S. senators, both Republicans, have publicly come out against the mine, adding further pressure on Trump to deny it permits.
 MEDIA
 Media companies are poised to benefit if Trump gets another four years in office, based on demand for TV, print and digital news coverage since his election in 2016.
 While news consumers first tuned in for coverage of the outspoken president and his administration, the triple threat of the coronavirus pandemic, an economic crisis, and racial strife have kept them engaged.
 The New York Times, for example, saw its digital-only subscriptions grow more than fourfold between the end of the second quarter in 2016 and the same period this year. Shares of the New York Times Co are up more than 250% since election day 2016.
 Evening TV news broadcasts have also seen a resurgence, with Comcast-owned NBC, ViacomCBS Inc-owned CBS and Walt Disney Co´s ABC experiencing their biggest news audiences in years.
 Ratings for cable news networks AT&amp;T-owned CNN, Fox Corp-owned Fox News and Comcast´s MSNBC - with their loyal, politically-divided followings - are up 72 percent from last year, according to Nielsen. Fox News was the highest- rated network in all of television for prime-time viewers in July, August and September, per Nielsen.
 But despite the uptick in audiences, news organizations continue to suffer from declining advertising revenue, spurred by Alphabet Inc's Google and Facebook Inc, and exacerbated by the pandemic. Many marketers have slashed their advertising budgets, leading news organizations to lay off tens of thousands of employees.
 If the negative news cycle continues into a second Trump term, ad dollars may not follow. For years, ad tech firms have offered tools for brands to block ads from appearing on web pages or URLs that include keywords like "shooting" or "murder." These advertising "blacklists" exploded in usage after the 2016 U.S. election, when brands sought to avoid polarizing news stories. Many brands have been reluctant to buy ads against coronavirus and Black Lives Matter coverage.
 A second Trump term could help sustain interest in journalism, with an engaged public glued to the news, and a president who has acknowledged his role keeping them there.
 "Another reason that I´m going to win another four years is because newspapers, television, all forms of media will tank if I´m not there because without me, their ratings are going down the tubes," Trump said in 2017, according to the New York Times.
 RETAIL/TRADE
 U.S. President Trump has imposed $370 billion in tariffs on goods imported from China, part of his "America First" agenda. Those tariffs on products ranging from handbags to small electronics are estimated to have cost U.S. importers some $61.6 billion through early September, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and have been blamed for eroding U.S. manufacturing competitiveness. Retailers argue the tariffs will result in higher prices for consumers and lost jobs.
 "If Trump wins, he will see the election as a validation of his strategy on trade policy, including his use of tariffs, and will certainly continue to follow this strategy with China," said Jonathan Gold, National Retail Federation Vice President for Supply Chain and Customs Policy.
 The trade organization hopes any new deal can be reached without the threat of tariffs.
 TECH
 If Trump holds the White House, big tech companies will face continued pressure from regulators on antitrust issues. The Trump administration has already sued Alphabet´s Google and a suit against Facebook is said to be coming soon. Should Democrats win the Senate, that could add to the risks for tech, as Democrats are calling for even more scrutiny of practices they say have stifled innovation and reduce competition. Trump may also ramp up his rhetorical war over what he contends is censorship of conservative views on the major social platforms.
 The most immediate tech question for Trump will be what to do with TikTok, the Chinese-owned app that his administration says is a security risk that must be transferred to American ownership or banned.
 With the election in the rearview, tech companies who depend on China as a supplier or buyer will be watching to see if Trump´s approach to trade ratchets up or cools down.

A Trump victory is worrying for the UK in the context of healthcare. He’s spoken previously about wanting the NHS to be open to American companies and suggested a US-UK trade deal post-Brexit would only be possible if the healthcare system was up for grabs. For his part, Boris Johnson has said the NHS will not be up for negotiation, but that hardly seems like the safest of promises.

“If there’s a guy that can just take over the reins and be the guy, then he’ll be the guy,” Lake said. “But from a defensive standpoint, if there’s a guy back there that can just take control that’s difficult to defend. If there’s a two-headed monster back there, that’s difficult to defend. We’re going to do whatever is best for our team to make sure we get victories.”
 Washington has been blessed with experience at the position for years. Jake Browning was a four-year starter at quarterback for the Huskies and Jacob Eason brought one year’s worth of experience starting in the SEC when he took over for Browning last season.
 Lake said his decision to not announce the starter comes simply from a competitive standpoint. His predecessor, Chris Petersen, did the same ahead of Browning’s first game in 2015.
 “I know our fans are excited. And believe me, we’re all excited. We can’t wait to go out and run out there on Saturday night and play really hard for you guys,” Lake said. “But what we’re never going to do here is release information that hurts us. And by us releasing that type of information only hurts us, it doesn’t help us.”
 Lake has been a defensive coach his entire career and having more insight into what is happening offensively is a change he’s welcomed. Lake said he’s been able to provide the perspective of what might cause headaches for opposing defenses.
 “It’s one of our anchors around here is constant growth and improvement,” Lake said. “I’ve really enjoyed that aspect of being able to be with the offensive coaches and just lend a hand the way I can and say, ‘Hey, you know what if you do this, this causes issues. This is extremely difficult, and the defense is going to see it this way.’ They’ve listened and it’s been definitely a joy and a different perspective for me.”

For those students and their families who have been preoccupied with the right sports team; the right grade; the right high school; the right college, one of the unintended upsides of the global pandemics is that more are seriously questioning what is right, and for whom. These questions are no longer rhetorical; they are very much grounded in reality. When we think about what brings us joy – true joy – it tends not to be what society or someone else has determined for us as the pinnacle of success. At the end of the day (or end of our lives), it’s the meaningful relationships in our lives and positive impact we have had on others that stay with us. The current reality we live in now underscores what the Harvard Study of Adult Development, one of the longest, longitudinal study (80 years+!), has shown –that care for self and care for others is fundamental to a joyful and meaningful life.

A Biden victory won’t put paid to paying for healthcare in the US, but it won’t make things worse at least. As you’d expect from someone who was involved in implementing Obamacare (aka the Affordable Care Act) in the first place, he wants to protect and expand that programme rather than abolish it. One of his policies is based on offering all Americans the chance to buy into public insurance rather than from a private company, which will keep prices lower and make choosing between getting treatment and being able to pay your bills less of a headache.

"Oh absolutely," said Secretary of State Kim Wyman. "I do think we are going to probably be near 90%."
 King County Elections Director Julie Wise agreed — enthusiastically. "After 20 years in this industry I have never seen anything like this. I am floating at this point. I am very, very, very excited," she said.
 Ballots must be postmarked or deposited in official elections office drop boxes by 8 p.m. Tuesday. Wyman advises late voters to use drop boxes as soon as possible to avoid a last-minute rush.
 The intense voter interest, fueled by President Donald Trump's contentious reelection battle with Democratic challenger Joe Biden, mirrors the national picture.
 At least 93 million people nationally have voted in the 2020 general election, already reaching nearly 68% of the number of votes cast in the 2016 general election, according to the U.S. Elections Project, a national vote-tracking website maintained by University of Florida professor Michael McDonald.
 Because of the coronavirus pandemic, many states have followed Washington's years-long example and made voting easier by expanding vote-by-mail options. Republicans have sued to block such measures in key swing states.
 In Washington, congressional, legislative and statewide contests also are driving turnout, including Gov. Jay Inslee's bid for a third term against GOP challenger Loren Culp.
 The early turnout so far has favored Democrats over Republicans, leaders and analysts from both parties say.
 Caleb Heimlich, chairman of the state Republican Party, said early votes are trending Democratic, but he expects Republicans to make up ground.
 "We expect a lot of Republican ballots coming in this weekend and on Election Day. I would anticipate whatever numbers we see Tuesday night would move in the Republican direction in later counts," he said.
 Friday Guilbert, data director for the state Democratic Party, agreed that Democrats have outpaced Republicans in early voting. But she cautioned the party isn't resting on that lead — or even counting on turnout setting a record.
 "We want to be cautious about people getting so excited about the early vote information that they lose their sense of urgency," Guilbert said. "When Democrats vote we win. Get your ballot in."
 Don Skillman, co-founder of Voter Science, a Bellevue political data and consulting firm that has worked with GOP candidates, said there are also warning signs for Washington Republicans when it comes to new voter registrations.
 An analysis by the firm shows a burst of voters in Democratic leaning congressional districts. For example, more than 26,000 voters newly registered this year had already cast ballots in the Seattle-area's 7th Congressional District as of Thursday, compared with about 13,000 in the conservative 4th District of Central Washington.
 Those registration trends could hurt a GOP already at a disadvantage in a Democratic leaning state, and cut against the notion of any stealth "red wave" in the offing that could benefit candidates like Culp.
 "While a silent majority or red wave has been promised in the governor's race, practical indications of this would be reflected in the voter registration totals statewide," Skillman said. "Ultimately, the numbers simply do not support this at the state or congressional levels."
 The registration figures will continue to shift, however, as people are allowed to register to vote and fill out a ballot right through Election Day.
 In the Democratic stronghold of King County, 70% of voters (nearly 1 million) already have sent in ballots, accounting for nearly one-third of all the votes across the state. Turnout in Seattle was even higher, running at 76% as of Saturday.
 In Snohomish County, turnout has reached 67%; in Pierce County it's at 64%; and in Spokane County 67%.

Hollywood must deal with the burden of producing TV programs during a pandemic and at a time of social and political upheaval in our country. Viewers, however, deserve better than to endure heavy on-screen doses of the very things they are hoping to escape in real life.
 The issue was brought into sharp focus in the season premiere of NBC’s drama “This Is Us,” which has pleased audiences and won numerous awards. Now, after four years of untangling the complicated fictional lives of the Pearson family, we find the characters discussing George Floyd’s death and Black Lives Matter, while wearing masks to cope with COVID-19.
 Although too melodramatic for some, I’ve loved the series. The writing is compelling, the dramatic themes believable and the acting exceptional. Most appealing is the show’s deft intercutting of scenes from the characters’ lives spread over several decades.
 The producers had long developed a storyline that would play out over the final two seasons. Then, when the pandemic hit and production was delayed, a decision was made to incorporate both the coronavirus and racial strife in new episodes. The show’s creator, Dan Fogelman, said it would have “felt almost irresponsible” to avoid writing actual events into the plot.
 The NBC series is not the first to take on current themes. Netflix’s eight- part anthology “Social Distance” fictionalized the lives of people dealing with the pandemic, as did the four-part “Love in the Time of Corona,” distributed by Hulu. But these are limited-run projects, designed expressly to explore the effects of the pandemic.
 An established series like “This Is Us” faces different obstacles when dipping into current events. If the Pearsons wear masks and talk about COVID-19, and if Randall Pearson’s Black family agonizes over George Floyd’s death, then who are the Pearsons voting for? How can a series be so “on the nose,” as Hollywood puts it, about viruses and protests, while ignoring the most divisive election of our times?
 It can’t. Fogelman was right to skip the election, telling the LA Times, “I don’t think our show is the forum for it.” But he was creatively misguided to cherry-pick other topics from the headlines. Earlier, for example, the show developed a compelling political theme about Sterling K. Brown’s character, Randall Pearson, running for city council in Philadelphia, while staying clear of real-life politics. Similarly, we see Pearson exploring his Black identity, but we don’t need it reinforced by actual news about protests in Minneapolis.
 Medical dramas, including ABC’s “Grey’s Anatomy” and “The Good Doctor” have incorporated coronavirus themes for this season. Even the animated series “South Park” had a pandemic-themed special, a standalone episode on Comedy Central.
 Hollywood’s rush to relevance could be a serious misjudgment about viewers’ interests during these stressful times. For some of us, the drone of television’s “breaking news” provides as much topical tension as we can tolerate.
 Fogelman and his team are taking “This Is Us” down a rabbit hole where art imitates the very things in life we’d just as soon forget, at least for an hour or so.

Delhi Capitals might have won the match on Monday but for Royal Challengers Bangalore RCB all rounder Shahbaz Ahmed it was his first IPL wicket and that too of Shikhar Dhawan that made his day special. Delhi Capital defeated RCB by six wickets on Monday. Chasing 153, Shikhar Dhawan and Ajinkya Rahane started with the bat for Delhi as both batsmen played knocks of 54 and 60 respectively. Delhi won the match by six wickets with six balls to spare. Shahbaz dismissed set batsman Dhawan and Delhi Capitals skipper Shreyas Iyer. Today s match was crucial for us and it s good that we had a better run rate so we have qualified despite the loss. The intensity to win the game is one of the positive for us, Shahbaz said at the post match press conference. The practice camp started before IPL has helped me. And the first wicket in IPL that too of Shikhar Dhawan is a special feeling, he added. Having won the toss and bowled first, the DC outfit kept on the pressure from the word go and didn t let the RCB batsmen hit fourth gear. They put on a disciplined show with the ball as they restricted RCB to 152 7 in their 20 overs at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium Shahbaz feels the wicket got a lot better in the second innings and they might have felt 15 runs short of the par score. Wicket was good to bat and eventually became better in the second innings because of dew. We had a discussion, we were actually 15 runs short as the wicket was slow in the first innings, said Shahbaz. With this win, Delhi Capitals have qualified for the playoffs and the side will now get two chances to play the finals after finishing second at the points table. On the other hand, RCB with 14 points from as many matches will surely finish in the top four in the standings.

So, what should we expect to see from the next generation of turbines? Today, MHI Vestas turbines top out at 10 MW with rotor sizes of 164 meters, or up to 174 meters in a 9.5 MW iteration.
 GE, meanwhile, shot into offshore contention with its Haliade-X platform with capacities of 12 and 13 MW and 220-meter rotor size. Deliveries to the Dogger Bank project in the U.K could begin as early as 2023.
 Offshore market leader Siemens Gamesa, launched a 14 MW turbine with a 222-meter rotor in May this year. Its first order, the 1.4 GW Sofia project in the U.K., will begin construction in 2024.
 That's the competition, and Vestas will need to match it. Barla expects Vestas' next iteration of turbine to have a rotor size of around 240 meters and a capacity of between 14 and 16 MW. Anything short of that "would be terribly disappointing."
 ## Offshore business importance on show
 Siemens Gamesa and Vestas have been experiencing similar trials, but in opposing verticals -- one at sea and one on land. The lengths to which both have gone to develop the three-legged revenue stool of onshore, offshore and services reflects the competitive nature of the wind power business.
 While Siemens Gamesa has enjoyed market leadership in offshore, its onshore business has been making losses, which have ultimately led to an overhaul of the company management. New CEO Andreas Nauen was the head of the successful offshore business unit, and has been moved into the top job in hope that he can replicate that success.
 Vestas has been breaking order intake records in concurrent quarters. Its share price rose all summer and hit an all-time record in October of DKK 1,166. Prior to 2020 it had never been above DKK 700. With a solid service revenue backlog as well, the lack of profitability at MHI Vestas, which reports outside of the listed Vestas Wind Systems A/S, was perhaps the only major missing part of the puzzle.  
 Growth projections for offshore wind have strengthened through the COVID-19 pandemic. This year the Global Wind Energy Council revised its 2030 cumulative capacity forecast 234 GW, up 15 GW compared to the 2019 view. The U.K. based trade body, RenewableUK, has tracked a 50 percent increase in the offshore wind project pipeline over the course of the last year.
 Vestas is now better placed to capture that growth as the master of its own offshore fortunes.

It will significantly enhance the number of officers available in the city to respond to any election-related violence that may occur.
 Brown said the plan is intended to keep the peace, protect free speech and prevent violence and intimidation on Election Day and in the days that follow in Portland. She said she issued the order with the support of Portland’s elected officials.
 The Oregon National Guard’s members who are trained in crowd control will be on standby if needed to assist the law enforcement officers, according to the governor’s office.
 Last week, Portland Police Chief Chuck Lovell announced that the Police Bureau canceled all officers' days off for Election Day through Nov. 9.
 Multnomah County Sheriff Mike Reese said his deputies will be stepping up patrols around voter ballot drop-off boxes and the county’s election headquarters. Reese said then that there have been no specific threats directed toward the elections in the county.
 Just last Thursday, Reese, Lovell and State Police Superintendent Terri Davie said the command structure for the election hadn’t been finalized but they pledged to work together.
 “We have a long history of working together,” Lovell said then. “We’re working very closely with one another and other partners and elected officials to make sure we have the operational resources on hand.”
 The governor last issued a similar joint unified command during the Sept. 26 weekend when the Proud Boys rallied in North Portland’s Delta Park. On that day, the U.S. Marshals Service, at the request of former State Police Supt. Travis Hampton, gave special deputy federal marshal status to 56 Portland police officers who are members of the bureau’s Rapid Response Team.

The Delhi-based side had the best start to the tournament, winning seven out of their first nine games. However, Shreyas Iyer and his men suffered four losses on the bounce to slip to the third spot and were in danger of missing out on the play-offs due to their deteriorating net run-rate.      But they got their act together in the nick of time, beating Royal Challengers Bangalore by six wickets on Monday to ensure a top-two finish in the IPL table.      "It has been the hardest thing ( _to have lost four matches_ ). I think, over the last couple of weeks, the key was to make sure that the confidence was still up," Ponting said.      "Whenever you lose a few games in a row at the back-end of tournament, it can sometimes be a bit difficult to change the momentum. But, credit to the boys -- they were outstanding. You could see different energy around the group that really set the tempo for the whole game," he added.      The Delhi Capitals dished out an all-round performance against the Virat Kohli-led RCB in their final league match.      "It wasn't the perfect game but it was a really good, solid performance that we needed to put up. They are a really good side, and we won with an over to spare, which in T20 cricket is quite a big margin."      Delhi will take on defending champions and table toppers Mumbai Indians in the Qualifier 1 match on Thursday, with the winner going through to the final, while the loser gets another shot at the title clash, as they play in the Qualifier 2 game.      "I am most proud because it was do-or-die, and the boys knew that and they responded in a really positive manner," said the former Australia captain.      "The way I am looking at it now is that we have done that, and we just have two more games to play, and it will gear ourselves up to try and win the first final, then let's see how we can go from there.      "So we can look ahead now to MI, who have beaten us twice in this tournament, and make sure we are ready to go for them in a few days," Ponting said.      Speaking about his team's record at Abu Dhabi where they won only their first match on Monday, Ponting said, "Well, that's funny because I have purposely not spoken about the venue or the ground.      "I mean, the first couple of games that we played, we talked about, 'Oh we can't win in Abu Dhabi, what is it about the ground,' but coming into this game, we didn't mention of it at all, it's just another ground.      "The wicket was outstanding, that's probably the best wicket we've had right through the tournament," said the batting legend.      On the challenges of living inside the bio-secure bubble, Ponting said it has been hard for everyone.      "I think there have been a lot of challenges, through this tournament as well, with three and a half weeks training before our first game, being in a bubble, in a lock-down.      "It's been hard, and I think every team at some stage was just a little bit of down because of that - ours just happened in the last couple of weeks. But now this could be a real moment for us to gear up for the last 10 days of the tournament."

But Tampa Bay (6-2) had to sweat it out. Daniel Jones drove New York (1-7) 70 yards in 13 plays and connected with Golden Tate for a 19-yard touchdown with 28 seconds remaining. The 2-point conversion failed as the officials picked up a flag presumably for defensive pass interference.
 Brady and Gronkowski earlier combined for a 3-yard scoring pass on which Gronk barely held onto the ball long enough. That made the old New England combination second in TDs for a duo with 93, 21 behind Peyton Manning and Marvin Harrison of the Colts.
 Unable to connect with Evans on a 2-point conversion, Brady still had the Bucs on top 15-14.
 After New York went back ahead on Graham Gano’s 33-yard field goal, Daniel Jones was pressured into an unwise throw to Tate that Sean Murphy-Bunting picked off at the Tampa 33. That set the stage for the 66-yard drive to the touchdown by Evans.
 Jones had two costly picks, helping negate a strong effort by New York’s defense.
 New York got an early break — and soon after a touchdown — when Brady’s pass was tipped by Dalvin Tomlinson and caught by Bucs running back Ronald Jones. But he fumbled when hit by Blake Martinez and rookie Darnay Holmes recovered at the Tampa Bay 12.
 Dion Lewis’ made a sliding catch in the corner of the end zone on third down for a 7-3 lead.
 Ronald Jones was a nonfactor the rest of the half as Leonard Fournette got most of the action.

Paul Merson has claimed that Thomas Partey’s arrival should have reopened the door for Mesut Ozil at Arsenal, after watching Chelsea impress on Saturday.
 The Blues were convincing 3-0 winners over Burnley at the weekend, despite lining up with a back four plus N’Golo Kante, while the rest of the players were given the freedom to attack up the field.
 Their display has led to Paul Merson to believe that Arsenal in fact missed a trick in leaving Mesut Ozil out of their playing squad.
 The German will not be playing outside of domestic cup competitions between now and the winter transfer window, having not been registered to play in either the Premier League or Europa League currently.
 The signing of Partey has convinced Merson that Ozil’s ommision was a mistake, with the midfielder giving Arsenal enough to accommodate the former Real Madrid star.
 “I think there was a stage for Ozil now Partey’s in the team,” he told SkySports. “I watched Chelsea play against Burnley, they played a back four, they played N’Golo Kante in front of the back four, and let everyone else get on with it. They ripped Burnley to shreds, I haven’t seen too many teams make Burnley look bang average.
 “Because Kante was playing in that holding role, it gave Kai Havertz and Mason Mount the freedom to do what they want, they didn’t have to spend most of their time on the edge of their own box tracking back.
 “With Partey in there now who’s so dominant in there and doesn’t lose the ball, I think there was a place for Ozil now. I think there was.
 “Then if they do drop someone in to pick up Ozil, you’ve got someone like Partey who’s very comfortable on the ball and can hurt you. Then that frees a midfield player up. I think there’s a trick being missed here, but that’s just me.”
 If Ozil’s ommision was only on football terms, should Partey’s arrival have brought Mesut in from the cold?

Washington's handling of the COVID-19 crisis, the economic fallout and the nation's uneasy mood are all on the ballot. Stunning amounts of cash have been flowing to Democrats from millions of Americans apparently voting with their pocketbooks; Republicans are tapping deep-pocketed donors to shore up GOP senators.
