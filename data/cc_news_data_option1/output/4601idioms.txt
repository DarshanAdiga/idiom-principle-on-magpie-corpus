Tonight’s visit to the circus on TCM features a variety of genres whose stories are told under the big top. First up is _Man on a Tightrope_ (1953), which was directed by Elia Kazan and whose fictional story is based on the real-life escape of the Circus Brumbach from East Germany in 1950 (members of the actual Circus Brumbach appear in character roles and as extras in the film). Then, in the musical _Merry Andrew_ (1958), Danny Kaye plays an unconventional teacher who takes up with a traveling circus. The final film is Federico Fellini’s acclaimed _La Strada_ (1954, in Italian with English subtitles), which won an Oscar as Best Foreign Language Film and was nominated for its screenplay. It tells the story of Gelsomina (Giulietta Masina), a simple-minded young woman who is bought from her mother by Zampanò (Anthony Quinn), a brutish strongman/street performer who takes her with him on the road, where she endures physical and emotional pain.

As tensions rise between the queen and Britain’s first female prime minister, Margaret Thatcher (Gillian Anderson), Charles’ romance with a young Lady Diana Spencer (Emma Corrin) provides a much-needed fairy tale to unite the British people. Behind closed doors, however, the royal family is becoming increasingly divided.

Custom software development is becoming popular among enterprises that are largely looking for scaling up of their business operations. Custom software development offers several benefits to enterprises. One of the key benefits is reduction in long-term costs. However, initial development and implementation of custom software is costlier than that of basic software solutions. However, in the long run, these basic software solutions do not fit to the increasing requirement of businesses and hence, the organization may have to start the process of software procurement and implementation all over again. In case of custom software development, the scenario is quite different. Since the software is custom-made, enterprises do not require any further investment in the software, in the long run. This, in turn, leads to total cost reduction.

Five years after a squad of jihadist killers carried out France's deadliest peacetime atrocity, the country is again on its highest security alert following a spate of attacks blamed on Islamist radicals.
 The night of carnage on November 13, 2015 saw 130 people killed and 350 wounded when Islamist suicide bombers and gunmen attacked the Stade de France stadium, bars and restaurants in central Paris and the Bataclan concert hall.
 The sheer horror of the attacks, which were claimed by extremists from the Islamic State (IS) group, left scars that have still not healed. Modern France's attitude towards Islam remains an issue of burning controversy.
 And the security threat to France has not diminished, security sources say, even if the nature of the risk has changed with attackers more likely to be lone extremists inspired by a deadly ideology than part of an organised group.
 The fifth anniversary of the November 2015 strikes will come with France still reeling from three attacks in the last weeks: a knife attack outside the former offices of the Charlie Hebdo weekly, the beheading of a teacher and a deadly stabbing spree at a Nice church.
 \- 'Illusion' -
 "You might think that the threat has faded into the background as other problems emerged," a French security source, who asked not to be named, told AFP.
 "But in reality, the figures show that it has remained high since 2015."
 In the last five years, 20 attacks have been carried out on French soil, 19 plots failed and 61 were foiled.
 There has been an increasing trend of attacks being carried out by isolated individuals, previously unknown to the intelligence services, who are inspired by jihadist propaganda and carry out attacks with cold weapons needing little preparation.
 But the threat of an attack planned from outside France -- as was the case on November 13, 2015 -- remains serious.
 "Just because IS has suffered a military defeat does not mean its military capacities have been annihilated," said a French official involved in the fight against terror, who asked not to be named.
 Between 100 and 200 French jihadists are still believed to be in former IS strongholds in northern Iraq and Syria, and it would be an "illusion" to think they were not capable of clandestinely coming back to France, added the official.
 \- Repeated attacks -
 In January 2015, Islamist gunmen massacred staff at the Charlie Hebdo satirical weekly, claiming they were avenging its publication of cartoons of the prophet Mohammed.
 True to its defiant reputation, the magazine republished the cartoons to mark the start in September of the trial of suspected accomplices in the killings.
 In the wake of that move, a Pakistan-born man wounded two people with a meat cleaver on September 25 outside Charlie Hebdo's former offices.
 Teacher Samuel Paty, who had shown his class the cartoons, was beheaded outside his school on October 16 by an Islamist radical from Chechnya. And on October 29 a man recently arrived from Tunisia killed three people with a knife in a Nice church.
 The attacks reopened painful debates in France about the integration of Muslim minorites and also prompted tougher rhetoric from President Emmanuel Macron against radical Islam.
 \- 'Background noise' -
 The security source said the risks were higher in the context of the current Charlie Hebdo trial and another trial over the Paris attacks, which is due to open early next year.
 These hearings keep up "a kind of background noise" with the risk of "actions of support to those" who are on trial, said the security source.
 The 2021 trial into the Paris attacks will see just one of the suspecter perpetrators in the dock -- French-Belgian Salah Abdeslam.
 Nineteen other suspects accused of providing various logistical support will be on trial with him, though five are presumed dead in Iraq or Syria will be tried in absentia.
 The suspected coordinator of the attacks -- Belgian Abdelhamid Abaaoud who shot indiscriminately at packed cafe terraces that night -- was killed five days later in a police assault on the Paris suburb of Saint Denis.

Geneva's famous Jet d'Eau fountain, which spouts water over a hundred metres into the air, is to remain switched off to signal the need for people to observe virus restrictions, authorities said Wednesday.
 The Lake Geneva landmark had been due to be turned back on this week after annual maintenance work, but local officials have decided it is better to leave it off for now.
 The Geneva cantonal government said in a statement that it, "in light of the current health situation in Switzerland and Geneva linked to the Covid-19 pandemic," it had decided to shut down the landmark.
 By leaving the majestic fountain, which usually attracts large numbers of tourists, switched off, authorities said they hoped to "send a new signal to the population" that outings and interactions needed to be restricted as far as possible.
 The canton also shut down the Jet d'Eau during the 83 days of partial confinement in Switzerland when the first wave of the pandemic hit the country in the spring.
 The fountain, which shoots water 140 metres (460 feet) into the air at 200 kilometres an hour before allowing it to cascade down into Lake Geneva, has towered visibly over the centre of the city virtually every day since 1891.
 It is usually only shut down by strong winds or freezing temperatures.
 Like some landmarks in other cities, such as the Empire State Building in New York it is usually lit up in varying colours in the evening.
 Switzerland emerged relatively unscathed from the first wave of the pandemic.
 But it has been hard-hit by the second wave, and Geneva, which is struggling with saturated hospitals, has shuttered all restaurants, bars and non- essential shops in a bid to stem the surging numbers of cases and deaths.

But, despite suffering no such fitness issues, Williams has largely been stuck on the sidelines since featuring in that same game.
 And, unfortunately for Klopp, the consequences of that decision reared their head this week at Manchester City.
 Alexander-Arnold's calf strain is no huge shock given that he has already clocked up 951 minutes for Liverpool across the first two months of the season, the fourth highest in the squad.
 What is, in fact, surprising, is that Robertson, whose 1,084 minutes puts him clear of any of his colleagues, hasn't yet joined his fellow defender in the treatment room.
 While Klopp is right to question the Premier League's decision to revert to three substitutions per match this season, it is also entirely fair to wonder why he has not taken alternative action to protect his players.
 Leaving Alexander-Arnold or Robertson out for games against Atalanta and Manchester City was rightly not considered, but there were plenty of opportunities prior to that double-header to give them a rest.
 That said, choosing the right moment to omit such key players is far easier said than done.
