In fact, it's quite possible that wagons are already on the rebound. Luxury wagons, in particular, are selling quite well. BMW has introduced a new 3 Series wagon for 2000, and sales of Volvos and Saabs are healthy. But on the more mundane and affordable side of things, wagon pickings are still pretty slim. Japanese manufacturers ditched their slow-selling sedan-based wagons eons ago. If you want an affordable midsize station wagon, you will end up with one of five possible choices: the Ford Taurus, the Mercury Sable, the Saturn LS, the Subaru Legacy or the Volkswagen Passat. As you might have guessed, we're here to talk about the Mercury Sable Wagon. (If you guessed that we are here to talk about foot fetishes, you would be wrong.)

Home  / Mumbai News / Mumbai bus contractor loses business during lockdown, now drives taxi to make ends meet


--DocBreak--
In 2015, bus contractor Yusuf Khan was earning approximately Rs4 lakh a month and his company, Khan Travels, had eight buses to its name. Since the lockdown, most of those buses have been seized by banks; Khan Travels has been effectively grounded, and Khan is making ends meet as a taxi driver. Born and raised in Dharavi, 44-year-old Khan has worked hard to climb up the ranks. As the son of a fruit seller, his childhood was marked by poverty. He left school after Class 8 and started working as an electrician. When he was in his 20s, Khan learnt how to drive and went to work in Saudi Arabia as a taxi driver. He stayed in Saudi Arabia for five years and then returned to Mumbai. With his hard-earned savings, he bought a small bus. In 2013, he set up Khan Travels. By 2015, he had invested in eight buses and was earning around Rs 4-5 lakh each month. When the lockdown was imposed, his earnings dwindled swiftly as schools were closed and transport was taken off roads. "Two school buses were left, after the rest were seized by the banks [Khan had bought the buses with the help of loans], and they are biting the dust in the bus stand. There was no income for several months after the lockdown and I did not see the situation improving," said Khan, who is the sole breadwinner for his family and the father of two sons aged 13 and 17. In August, Khan started driving a black and yellow cab, which he has leased on rent. "I manage to earn Rs 20, 000 a month as a taxi driver but it is not enough to make ends meet," he said. The effects of the lockdown were harder to bear because Khan had been hit hard by demonetisation in November 2016. Khan's monthly income reduced from Rs 4-5 lakh to between Rs 50,000 and 60,000 and subsequently, he had to scale back his operations. He had been hoping to expand by adding more school buses to Khan Travels, but the lockdown put an end to those plans. Since March, Khan could only watch was his carefully-built business collapsed and his savings were depleted. Despite the setbacks, Khan remains determined and optimistic. "I have no regret that things did not turn out as planned and I have no shame to work as a taxi driver again. The money I earn is through sheer hard work. Financially, I have seen some very difficult phases in life and if I have managed to overcome those, I shall overcome this as well," he said.

Since the wagon is so similar to the sedan, interior dimensions for passengers are nearly identical. The Sable Wagon offers nearly the same amount of room for rear seat passengers that a Sable Sedan does. As such, there is enough legroom, shoulder room and foot room for adults. Over long distances, however, they will probably complain about the lack of headrests and armrests and then find fault with the seat contouring. Or more accurately, the lack of contouring. The rear seat's surfaces are about as flat as a topography map of Kansas. In terms of creature comforts, Mercury provides rear passengers with door-mounted storage bins, map pockets on the back of the front seats, rear air vents and a rather flimsy cupholder that pulls out from the rear of the center console.

Here's how it works: A merchant signs up to be a Klarna brand partner -- enabling it to offer the service to customers. A customer is interested in a product from a brand or retailer that is using Klarna. The customer opts to use the service and pays 25% to the brand or retailer up front; Klarna pays the remaining balance of the product's cost to the brand and assumes all risks. The customer repays Klarna -- with no interest -- in 25% payment installments. Klarna also doesn't charge late fees. So if a customer falls behind on payments, the company puts a hold on his/her account so he/she isn't able to make additional purchases for the time being.

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — The Venezuelan government said Monday that it had pardoned more than 100 people, including political opponents who are in prison, have taken refuge in foreign embassies in Caracas or fled the country.
 The move comes ahead of congressional elections set for Dec. 6 that the movement led by U.S.-backed opposition leader Juan Guaidó says it is boycotting because conditions for the vote are not fair.
 The names listed in the pardon don’t include prominent opposition leaders such as Leopoldo López, who remains inside a foreign ambassador’s residence in Caracas, or Julio Borges, a powerful opposition lawmaker who is in neighboring Colombia.
 Minister of Communications Jorge Rodríguez listed 110 people being pardoned, although the terms of the announced amnesty were not clear.
 “The government's intention is to deepen the process of national reconciliation for national union so that political issues are settled by peaceful means and by electoral means,” Rodríguez said.

“I feel OK, but I am a bit tired because we worked on all those plans, security plans, and risks assessments the last two weeks, and it was a lot of work," said Karin Heremans, director of the Atheneum Antwerp in the northern Belgian port city. “We have 600 students so we need to manage everything. But I am very hopeful.”
 One of the main worries is whether students will be able to wear masks the entire school day. The World Health Organization says students 6 to 11 should wear masks in cases where they cannot social distance, and students 12 and over should wear masks just like adults.
 “We are really wondering how it will go if we ask students of all ages to wear one or two masks all day long," said Luc Pirson, President of FAPEO parents' federation in Belgium. “No adults (teachers) for the moment had to wear masks for 8 hours straight. So we really hope that teachers, administrations will make space in the schedule to allow students to breathe normally.”
 It all underscores what WHO's Europe office on Monday called “the largest disruption of education systems in history."
 Nations across the continent, which has seen over 209,500 confirmed deaths in the pandemic, are already struggling to contain a renewed wave of infections and are desperate to keep school openings from worsening the situation.

Actors on each side have actively debated whether global technology firms threaten free expression, and how this can be regulated to preserve Americans' (and other international users’) rights. Moreover, the two parties represent differing goals and constituents. Whereas legislative bodies operate within government structures and are beholden to the electorate, tech giants must maintain a business model that drives profits for shareholders. As such, both governmental intervention and civil action are required to overcome challenges that powerful tech firms pose to society.

 # Davidson County jail inmate dies after contracting COVID-19
 Natalie Neysa Alund
 Nashville Tennessean
 A female Davidson County inmate has died as a result of COVID-19, the Davidson County Sheriff's Office reported Monday.
 The 64-year-old woman, who had been hospitalized at Nashville General Hospital since Aug. 18, died Saturday after contracting the virus, said Karla West, a spokeswoman for the sheriff's office.
 The sheriff's office did not identify the woman.
 Prior to being hospitalized, the woman was arrested July 7 and charged with failure to appear on a fourth-offense driving under the influence charge.
 At the time of her death, she was being held on $500,000 bond, West said.
 On Monday, the jail's total inmate population stood at 1,197 and West said there were two inmates testing positive for COVID-19 with 324 who have recovered.
 The number of inmates on restriction stood at 124.
 Seven DCSO employees are currently testing positive and 89 have now recovered.
 The Davidson County Sheriff’s Office continues to coordinate with the Metropolitan Public Health Department regarding COVID-19 testing, medical housing of inmates and staff safety guidelines, West said.

Here's how it works: A merchant signs up to be a Klarna brand partner — enabling it to offer the service to customers. A customer is interested in a product from a brand or retailer that is using Klarna. The customer opts to use the service and pays 25% to the brand or retailer up front; Klarna pays the remaining balance of the product's cost to the brand and assumes all risks. The customer repays Klarna — with no interest — in 25% payment installments. Klarna also doesn't charge late fees. So if a customer falls behind on payments, the company puts a hold on his/her account so he/she isn't able to make additional purchases for the time being.

Senior US and Israeli officials have landed in the United Arab Emirates on a historic trip to finalise a pact marking open relations between Israel and the Gulf state, urging Palestinians to negotiate peace as well.
 White House senior adviser Jared Kushner added on arrival that the US could maintain Israel's military edge while advancing its ties to the UAE, the Arab world's second largest economy and a regional power.
 Announced on August 13, the normalisation deal is the first such accommodation between an Arab country and Israel in more than 20 years and was forged largely through shared fears of Iran.
 Palestinians were dismayed by the UAE's move, worried that it would weaken a long-standing pan-Arab position that called for Israeli withdrawal from occupied territory - and acceptance of Palestinian statehood - in return for normal relations with Arab countries.
 Kushner said Palestinians should not be "stuck in the past".
 "They have to come to the table. Peace will be ready for them, an opportunity will be ready for them as soon as they are ready to embrace it," said Kushner, part of a US delegation that accompanied Israeli officials on the first official Israeli flight from Tel Aviv to the UAE.
 Kushner and national security adviser Robert O'Brien head the US delegation.
 The Israeli team is led by O'Brien's counterpart Meir Ben-Shabbat.
 Israel and the United Arab Emirates will discuss economic, scientific, trade and cultural co-operation on the visit.
 Direct flights between the two countries will also be on the agenda, an Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman told al-Arabiya television after landing in Abu Dhabi.
 Even before landing, the delegates made aviation history when the Israeli commercial airliner flew over Saudi territory on the direct flight from Tel Aviv to the UAE capital.
 "That's what peace for peace looks like," Netanyahu tweeted, describing a deal for formal ties with an Arab state that does not entail handover of land that Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war.
