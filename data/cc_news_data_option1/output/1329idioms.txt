Middle and high school teachers will also check in with their students each week.
 School board member Donna H. Wells asked what will happen for a high school student, for example, who did not have failing grades as of March 13, who chooses not to do the learning activities at home.
 Kiracofe said that the grades students had on March 13 will be their standing grades for the 2019-2020 academic year.
 “I think it’s going to be very difficult for us to enforce from afar,” Kiracofe said of instruction at home.
 She said that the school system understands some students will be taking care of younger siblings while parents continue to go to work during the pandemic. Other students will have to get jobs to help the family financially.
 “So we know there are going to be a lot of different circumstances happening. So we just need to do our best, provide resources so kids continue to be engage with learning as much as possible,” Kiracofe said.
 In the fall, teachers and staff of Augusta County Schools will have to be ready to pick up where students were academically on March 13.
 Bond said staff has pointed out now is the time for teachers to work individually with students who were struggling in school before March 13.
 “Certainly, it’s a two-way street, and they’re going to have to put forth some effort as well,” Bond said.”But that one-on-one connection may be more prevalent than it was before.”
 The COVID-19 pandemic will affect budgets for school systems across Virginia by decreasing the amount of state tax revenue, of which school systems receive a portion.
 Collins asked Bond if he had any new information regarding the state budget.
 “I don’t have anything definite,” said Bond at Thursday’s meeting.
 With restaurants and retail businesses closed during the pandemic, or open only for drive-through and carry-out customers, the economy in Virginia and the U.S. has taken a hit.
 “I’m anticipating some edits to the state budget,” Bond said.
 He added that he expects to have more information for the school board at its regular May meeting.
 Collins said that on Monday he, other members of the school board and Bond met separately with members of the Augusta County Board of Supervisors to discuss the school system’s budget for 2020-2021. The budget is not complete until approved by the supervisors.

The airport where I landed had planes of all kinds: some were enormous with state of the art technology, some were luxurious with all the appropriate trappings, and others were incredibly fast and powerful military fighters. Imagine my surprise when I discovered that none of these were used for anything other than transporting cargo. Likewise, they were equally surprised when I told them that in my world we use planes to carry both cargo and people.

GOP leaders across the board have lambasted Pelosi for citing the crisis as a reason to restore the federal tax deduction for state and local taxes. Putting the deduction back in place would have chiefly helped higher income earners in high-tax, Democratic-run states such as California, New York and New Jersey. The idea was widely panned and was seen as unrealistic, given opposition from Republicans.

Proprio quest'anno – spiegano i membri dell'equipe dei cantieri educativi - ricorre il decimo compleanno del cantiere educativo e ci è preparati intensamente all’appuntamento annuale sul tema “Riscoprire l’anima della città. Come ogni anno si sono coinvolte le scuole di tutti gli ordini e gradi alla preparazione in vista del rito 2020 ma nessuno poteva immaginare quello che l’umanità sta vivendo in questi giorni. E così ci si è dovuti fermare nella gestione delle attività ordinarie (dal sostegno scolastico ai laboratori) per trovare altre forme di “stare accanto” ai piccoli della nostra città. Eppure, nonostante le disposizioni necessarie alla gestione dell’emergenza attuale, sentiamo ancora più forte e significativo l’avvicinarsi della Pasqua, con il suo messaggio di speranza e rinascita. È questo il significato più profondo proprio di questo gesto di Crisci ranni, lanciare in alto, che negli anni si è dedicato ai piccoli della città ma anche alla città stessa. “Le città non sono un cumulo di pietre ma hanno un’anima”, queste le parole di Giorgio La Pira che quest’anno hanno ispirato la riflessione per il rito 2020. L’invito a riscoprire l’anima della nostra città, fatto a tutte le scuole di ogni ordine e grado, aveva visto l’adesione di circa 2000 bambini e ragazzi. Con loro erano iniziati i laboratori e i percorsi che, ripercorrendo la città dal basso verso l’alto, ci permettevano di scoprire le bellezze non solo architettoniche, naturalistiche e paesaggistiche della nostra città ma anche, e soprattutto, ciò che si cela oltre e dentro questa “melagrana spaccata”: delle radici forti, un cuore grande che nonostante limiti e contraddizioni, la rende una città aperta, accogliente, serena, cocciuta e bella!».

Dear Readers,
   
 Because of syndication scheduling, I write and submit my columns two weeks in advance of publication. Due to this time lag, the Q&A's will not reflect the latest information about the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic we are currently facing.
   
 Dear Amy,
   
 Our ostentatious friend is getting married (again) -- for real, this time. His first wedding was an extravagant affair, complete with a destination bachelor party, a destination wedding at a fancy resort, expensive bottles -- the works.
   
 We gave him a sizable gift on top of our over-the-top travel expenses.
   
 When the unhappy couple split up, after three tumultuous years, we discovered they were never married at all!
   
 These two successful lawyers took a look at their relationship and decided not to file the marriage license. They would say that they were procrastinating, hoping their relationship would improve to a point where marriage would become less risky, but it never got there.
   
 They certainly blew the 60-day window to file the license, but never returned any gifts.
   
 Now our friend is engaged to a new woman. In true fashion, his bachelor party and wedding will be in fabulous destinations and will demand great expense.
   
 We plan to give the couple a modest gift.
   
 We can't help but feel some injustice has been done, though we're not sure what. He never even sent us a gift for our wedding. Is it petty to consider this all in the past?
   
 -- Witness
   
 Your friend's sense of entitlement is ... impressive. However -- if you don't like the way this wedding is structured, you don't have to participate in it. Being invited to an extravaganza does not obligate a person to attend.
   
 I hope you spoke your mind (to him and his "bride") when you learned that his previous extravaganza was a scam, and I wonder if you like or respect him enough to continue to have a close relationship with him.
   
 It must be tempting to punish him for his previous behavior, but it is important to remember that he isn't the only person participating in this wedding. His bride should be presumed innocent (until proven to be equally craven).
   
 If you attend, a modest gift is called for. If you don't attend, you're off the hook.
   
 Dear Amy,
   
 My husband and I have been married for almost seven years. He has seven sisters (he is the only male in the family). He has one sister who always has to be the center of attention at family gatherings.
   
 It's so damn annoying! She always has to bring up the expensive family trips she has planned for the summer, and is always bragging about how good she has it, as if to say, "Don't you wish your husband was rich like mine?"
   
 She acts like a snotty, spoiled teenager.
   
 I would like to scream and tell her to shut up! If I sit down with one of his other sisters, she butts right into our conversation because she's "assuming" that I'm talking smack about her.
   
 I go to these gatherings for the sake of my husband and in order for our son to spend time with his cousins.
   
 Should I just sit in a corner and not talk to anyone, so I won't get bitten by the "poisonous serpent?"
   
 -- Confused
   
 If your sister-in-law acts like a spoiled teenager, then perhaps you should treat her like one. My preferred technique is to remember that I am the grown- up. Sometimes -- reacting at all is just feeding the serpent.
   
 You should practice behaving in a way that comes off as mature, detached, and overall neutral. Be aware that your body language can betray tension, and so try not to clench when you encounter her.
   
 In a family as large as this one, it should be fairly easy to avoid your sister-in-law. You should strive to engage in positive conversations with your other relatives at these gatherings. Never gossip about this in-law with her siblings -- even if they invite you to trash her, the rules of sisterhood dictate that they can criticize her, but you cannot.
   
 Dear Amy,
   
 "Stepmom-to-be" shared her concerns that her future adolescent stepson didn't do some little things around the house, like "pushing in his chair after dinner."
   
 This made the hair on the back of my neck stand up. Thank you for this line: "You should ask him to choose ways to contribute, go easy on him when he flakes out, and give him credit when he does well."
   
 I got a stepmom when I was his age, and I felt like she only noticed when I messed up!
   
 -- Stepson
   
 The whole "step" relationship is a long game. Yes, positive reinforcement is vital.
