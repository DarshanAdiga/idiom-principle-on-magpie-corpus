And a source they describe as a "dejected former senior White House official" told Politico, "Trump has done more to derail the Barrett nomination than any Democrat. They are screwing themselves, that's for sure."

The tussle over classification of workers highlights the political and business risks facing Uber, Lyft, DoorDash and numerous other companies that have built businesses on workers who are not classified as employees eligible for health coverage, unemployment insurance or other benefits.Under the company-sponsored ballot measure, gig workers would receive some benefits, including minimum pay, healthcare subsidies and accident insurance, but remain independent contractors not entitled to more substantial employee benefits.POLITICAL FIGHTThe question of whether so-called gig workers should be treated as employees has become a national issue in U.S. politics.U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his running mate, Senator Kamala Harris, have both voiced their strong support for California's labor law and directly called on voters to reject the companies' ballot proposal that would weaken it.The campaign of U.S. President Donald Trump has not directly weighed in on the ballot measure, but the administration's Labor Department in September published proposed rules that would standardize legal definitions across the country and provide more room for companies to maintain independent contractors. U.S. Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia criticized AB5 in an opinion piece published on Sept. 22.(Also read | Uber weighs purchase of BMW-Daimler ride-hailing venture)California represents 9% - or roughly $1.63 billion in all of 2019 - of Uber's global rides and food delivery gross bookings. However, California generates a negligible amount of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, Uber said in November.Lyft, which operates only in the United States and does not have a food delivery business, in August said California makes up some 16% of the company's total rides. Lyft does not break out ride-hailing revenue, but California contributed $576 million as a share of total 2019 revenue.FEWER DRIVERSCalifornia sued Uber and Lyft in May for not complying with AB5. The ride-hailing companies said their workers are properly classified as independent contractors, because they can set their own schedules.The companies say the majority of their drivers do not want to be employees, and work fewer than 25 hours a week. Many drivers use the service to supplement income from other jobs.While no legal requirements would prevent the companies from classifying part-time drivers as employees, Uber said administrative fixed costs per employee would make it more expensive to allow part-time employment. Uber said it would therefore be forced to reduce its California driver base by 76% to 51,000 full-time driver employees.Uber also said it could reduce cash wages to offset higher benefit costs, thereby lowering the potential tax burden.Lyft executives in court filings have said the company would have to \"substantially reduce\" its California driver base to a smaller number of driver employees, but has not provided a figure. The company did not respond to detailed requests for comment.",

FMCG major Marico on Monday said it has witnessed a partial revival in the consumer sentimentin the second quarter of the current fiscal after being impactedby the COVID-19 pandemic. Marico said although there were intermittent supply chain disruptions across locations due to localised lockdowns, the distribution network has rebounded back to near pre-COVID levels.&quot;The quarter was characterised by a partial revival of consumer sentiment, which also reflected in the company's performance across portfolio and channels,&quot; Marico said. &quot;Rural continued to perform better than urban aided by government's focused relief packages, relatively lower impact of the pandemic, the resilience of the agricultural sector in a declining GDP context and the consumption shift due to reverse migration of labour,&quot; it said in an update on the operating performance and demand trends in the September 2020 quarter. Marico said its India business witnessed signs of revival in consumer demand in the core categories contributing more than 90 per cent of the business and registered robust volume growth in the quarter.&quot;Foods portfolio, riding the tailwind and on the back of innovations, continued its momentum and registered exponential growth in line with the company's near-term expectations,&quot; the company said. Marico said duringthe secondquarter of the current fiscal, its international business clocked mid-single digit constant currency growth.&quot;Bangladesh continued to lead from the front with double digit growth while other markets have shown improvement sequentially,&quot; it added. During the quarter, the company said it upped the investments behind brand building and advertisement spends were back to pre-COVID levels.On outlook, Marico said although the key raw materials have seen an inflationary trend towards the end of the quarter, it expects to deliver healthy earnings growth on the back of robust volume growth and a host of cost saving initiatives. As lockdown restrictions are progressively easing, the company maintains a positive outlook for the rest of the year provided the ongoing health crisis does not escalate further and economic activity revives steadily.

Last month, Thai officials warned they might tap into Interpol in their search for Vorayuth Yoovidhya, the Red Bull heir who fled the country in 2017 to avoid charges regarding a hit-and-run that left a Bangkok motorcycle cop dead. They've made good on that promise, per the _New York Times_, which reports the international law-enforcement agency issued a "red notice" on Wednesday for Vorayuth, who also goes by the nickname "Boss"--its highest-level alert. "We will do whatever it takes," a spokesman for the Royal Thai Police says. "We have been working around the clock to get him back to the country." Vorayuth, said to be 37 or 38, was accused of crashing his Ferrari in 2012 and killing officer Wichean Glanprasert. The driver fled, but traces of fuel led authorities to Vorayuth's residence, where they found his smashed-up car nearby.

Petra Kvitova stood wide-eyed and perfectly still, scarcely believing she was through to her first French Open quarterfinal in eight years after winning 6-2, 6-4 against Zhang Shuai of China on Monday.
 When the chair umpire climbed down and pointed to the mark confirming her two- handed backhand had landed just in, she released her emotions. The seventh- seeded Czech player looked up in the air, then blew kisses and waved to the small crowd gathered on Court Philippe Chatrier, the tournament’s main stadium.
 “Yeah, I got a bit emotional last two points of my match,” she said. “My memories, happy memories. When I made my comeback here in 2017, when I step on the Philippe Chatrier, I couldn’t really imagine me to be in the quarterfinal of this slam. Everything just came back to me.”
 Three years ago, the left-handed Kvitova made her comeback at Roland Garros after sustaining serious injuries to her left hand  following a knife attack by a robber at her home in the Czech Republic.

“We are very excited to be working with GoodCell to understand a condition for which researchers have barely scratched the surface, especially as it relates to COVID-19,” said Larry Luchsinger, PhD, Head of the Laboratory of Stem Cell Regenerative Research; Director of the NYBC iPSC Program; and Principal Investigator, Assistant Member at the Lindsley F. Kimball Research Institute. “Although CH is highly prevalent in adults, its causes and effects are still largely unknown. Establishing an association with COVID-19 will prompt a closer look at the condition as a means to prevent mortality and to better personalize treatment approaches. GoodCell’s unique technology platform to study genetic variation in blood over time, paired with our access to donor samples, has the potential to be a powerful combination to evaluate this condition within the context of COVID-19 and further tip the scales against this virus.”

In their latest study, Susanne Dunker and her team of researchers have developed a novel method for the automation of pollen analysis. To this end they combined the high throughput of imaging flow cytometry - a technique used for particle analysis - with a form of artificial intelligence (AI) known as deep learning to design a highly efficient analysis tool, which makes it possible to both accurately identify the species and quantify the pollen grains contained in a sample. Imaging flow cytometry is a process that is primarily used in the medical field to analyse blood cells but is now also being repurposed for pollen analysis. "A pollen sample for examination is first added to a carrier liquid, which then flows through a channel that becomes increasingly narrow," says Susanne Dunker, explaining the procedure. "The narrowing of the channel causes the pollen grains to separate and line up as if they are on a string of pearls, so that each one passes through the built-in microscope element on its own and images of up to 2,000 individual pollen grains can be captured per second." Two normal microscopic images are taken plus ten fluorescence microscopic images per grain of pollen. When excited with light radiated at certain wavelengths by a laser, the pollen grains themselves emit light. "The area of the colour spectrum in which the pollen fluoresces - and at which precise location - is sometimes very specific. This information provides us with additional traits that can help identify the individual plant species," reports Susanne Dunker. In the deep learning process, an algorithm works in successive steps to abstract the original pixels of an image to a greater and greater degree in order to finally extract the species-specific characteristics. "Microscopic images, fluorescence characteristics and high throughput have never been used in combination for pollen analysis before - this really is an absolute first." Where the analysis of a relatively straightforward sample takes, for example, four hours under the microscope, the new process takes just 20 minutes. UFZ has therefore applied for a patent for the novel high-throughput analysis method, with its inventor, Susanne Dunker, receiving the UFZ Technology Transfer Award in 2019.

E-commerce major Snapdeal on Monday said it has expanded its logistics network in Punjab by opening two new centres in Jalandhar and Ludhiana. The expansion is part of a decentralised network designed by Snapdeal where its centres are located within manufacturing or commercial hubs to ensure faster pick up of packets from the sellers, a statement said.These new centres have been added to cater to the increased shipment volumes due to additional sellers now active from the cities of Ludhiana and Jalandhar, it said. Most of this new capacity will cater to shipments of fashion apparel including 'phulkari dupattas', crepe tops and 'anarkali' suits, and fashion accessories like watches.Phulkari embroidered masks have been a recent addition to the fashion trends originating from Punjab, it said. The sale of sports goods like badminton racquets, cricket sets, home gym equipment, punching bags, sports shoes, hand wraps, among others, has also been benefiting sellers from Jalandhar and surrounding towns, the statement added.&quot;Fashion and fitness are expected to witness high festive sales volumes due to an increase in the number of Indians preferring to buy online for convenience and safety reasons. The new centres are part of a pre-Diwali increase in capacity to cater to the festive spike in volumes,&quot; it said. The additional logistics capacity in Punjab has been added after witnessing a steady growth in business volumes from the state. The new centres make the fulfilment process simpler for manufacturers-sellers and will also ensure faster movement of shipments, a Snapdeal spokesperson was quoted as saying in the statement.Earlier this year, Snapdeal opened 23 logistics centres in cities like Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, Meerut, Hyderabad, Yamuna Nagar, among others. Snapdeal's logistics hubs offer dedicated facilities for manufacturing units, including packaging of orders and online tracking for orders in transit, and facilitates faster movement of packets.The bulk of Snapdeal's sellers in Punjab are from Amritsar, Ludhiana, Jalandhar, Patiala, Pathankot, Bhatinda, and Mohali. The online marketplace has more than 5 lakh registered sellers with over 220 million product listings.Snapdeal, which competes with players like Amazon and Flipkart, said 75,000 sellers have joined the platform in the last 18 months, with nearly 10,000 doing so during the pandemic period. About 85 per cent of Snapdeal's users are from non-metro cities.

In the final analysis, political leaders affect social and economic outcomes through their attempts to intelligently use soft and hard power innovatively and adaptively. Thus, for Namibia to progress, it needs political leadership that has integrity, intellectualism and patriotism. Political leaders in our country should strive for political unity, equal distribution of state resources, guard against tribalism and racism, insuring that, all government institutions function to the tunes of the electorates. Political leadership in Namibia is lacking trust; most political leaders have taken the route of manipulation to get what they want instead of coalition and building. Instead of leading out of love and a heart of service, most political leaders in our country are inspired by greedy and personal interests. Instead of building trust and working with the electorates to a greater end, they manipulate and threaten those who question their political leadership capabilities.

"As a public state university, our economic forecast is dependent upon our campus remaining open and students on campus. Currently, our students are on campus, but we have a reduced footprint with a 25-percent decrease in students living in university-provided housing. Enrollment was down 2 percent and most attribute that to COVID-19. Many students choose to stay close to home and attend classes at their local university or community college. Overall, our revenue will be down slightly this year, as long as our campus remains open. If we have to send students home due to a COVID-19 outbreak, then we will experience a drastic reduction in our revenue." (Educational Services)

The pollen samples examined in the study came from 35 species of meadow plants, including yarrow, sage, thyme and various species of clover such as white, mountain and red clover. In total, the researchers prepared around 430,000 images, which formed the basis for a data set. In cooperation with TU Ilmenau, this data set was then transferred using deep learning into a highly efficient tool for pollen identification. In subsequent analyses, the researchers tested the accuracy of their new method, comparing unknown pollen samples from the 35 plant species against the data set. "The result was more than satisfactory - the level of accuracy was 96 per cent," says Susanne Dunker. Even species that are difficult to distinguish from one another, and indeed present experts with a challenge under the microscope, could be reliably identified. The new method is therefore not only extremely fast but also highly precise.
