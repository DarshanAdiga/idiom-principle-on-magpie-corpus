Three men charged with murder in the fatal shooting of Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia face a hearing to determine whether authorities have enough evidence to send the case to a trial court.
 The hearing Thursday follows a week of angry protests in the U.S. over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Defense attorneys requested the proceeding to make prosecutors show whether they have probable cause to charge the men with murder.
 Arbery was killed Feb. 23 after a white father and son armed themselves and gave chase when they spotted the 25-year-old black man running in their neighborhood just outside the port city of Brunswick.
 It wasn’t until May 7 that those men — Greg McMichael, 64, and Travis McMichael, 34 — were charged with felony murder and aggravated assault. The McMichaels’ arrests came two days after cellphone video of the shooting leaked online and stirred a national outcry.

No one was injured, and the driver stopped and is cooperating with the investigation, Newport Beach Police Dept. spokeswoman Heather Rangel said. This doesn’t appear to have been a deliberate action, she added.
 For Gale Oliver Jr., a pastor at the Greater Light Family Church in Santa Ana, a protest against racism and police brutality in one of Orange County’s wealthiest enclaves was a sign of the times.
 “It’s a blessing that this is going on in Newport Beach,” said Oliver, who is black. “I mean, this is going on in _Newport Beach_? I guess America is finally listening.”
 Oliver said pastors in Santa Ana began meeting regularly with Orange County law enforcement officials about five years ago in hopes of ending “policing from the point of view that they’re under attack.” He’s seen progress, but more needs to be done, he said, here and throughout the country.

NEW YORK (AP) — A day that began with hope that New York City was beginning to find a way out of the crisis caused by the coronavirus and a week of angry demonstrations over police brutality ended Wednesday with more violence.
 Peaceful protests over the death of George Floyd drew thousands of people, but were broken up by police as rain poured down about an hour after the city's 8 p.m. curfew went into effect.
 Then, with the streets quiet for the first time in days, police said a man ambushed officers on an anti-looting patrol in Brooklyn, stabbing him in the neck. The attacker was shot by responding officers and was in critical condition.
 Two officers suffered gunshot wounds to their hands in the chaos, but all three wounded officers were expected to recover.
 Police Commissioner Dermot Shea called it “a completely, cowardly, despicable, unprovoked attack on a defenseless police officer." While he declined to say what motivated the attack, he drew a line to the heated rhetoric of the past week, in which angry crowds decrying police violence have also hurled insults, and sometimes bottles, bricks and firebombs, at officers and their vehicles.
 “Words matter,” Shea said.
 The attack came at the end of the day in which the police had drawn praise for bringing a stop to days of looting in some parts of the city, but also harsh criticism for rough tactics used to enforce the city's curfew.

"Product launch plans are part of a long-term business strategy," says a Hyundai Motors spokesperson. "The production plan is in sync with business plans and is dependent on vendors and supply chains. In case of unforeseen circumstances, sales plans are altered, keeping product launches and production plans in place."              "Much of the decision to continue with launches was because the lifecycle of an automobile is decided in advance," says Vinay Piparsania, consulting director-automotive at Counterpoint Technology Market Research. "Any upsets or deviation could have serious implications because the entire ecosystem and supply chain are involved. There is room to manoeuvre for a month or two, but not more than that."              The new launches were in line with the government-mandated shift to BS VI engines. "Typically, January, April and October are the best months to launch a vehicle," says Arun Malhotra, former managing director of Nissan India. "That's because it's New Year, the new financial year and the festive season. Many upgrades were to BS VI engines or petrol variants. So, there was no reason to delay their launches."              Carmakers believe newer models will now hit the market only by August or September when the economy could see some revival.               Vehicles such as the next-generation Honda City, Toyota's Urban Cruiser, MG Gloster and Kia Sonet are expected to be launched later this year. But the industry could also be in for some significant changes by then. "Personal mobility will take precedence and people will buy accessible and affordable cars," says Steffen Knapp, head, Volkswagen Passenger Cars India. "The used-car market has been growing and we will see significant purchases for those."              India's automakers have also begun to provide incentivised financial options to woo customers. Virtual showrooms,  online bookings, digital offerings and launches are expected to become the norm as well.          	        *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

TOKYO - Tokyo 2020 officials are looking at ways to scale back next year's postponed Olympics, the city's governor said on Thursday, amid reports the opening ceremony could be streamlined and spectator numbers cut.          Yuriko Koike told reporters that organisers were weighing up what could be "rationalised and simplified" as costs spiral for holding the first postponed Games in history.          The International Olympic Committee announced in March the Games would be delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic that has killed hundreds of thousands and brought international travel to a virtual halt.          The Games are now due to open on 23 July 2021, but organisers face the unprecedented headache of rearranging the event, which requires a costly rejigging of everything from venues to transport.          Local media said streamlining plans could involve cutting the number of spectators and reducing participation in the opening and closing ceremonies.          The Yomiuri Shimbun daily quoted an unnamed source as saying that everyone including athletes, officials and spectators would be required to take a test for the virus.          "The top priority is to avoid the worst scenario of cancelling the Games," an unnamed government source told the daily.          Tokyo 2020 spokesman Masa Takaya declined to offer further details as a press conference later on Thursday, saying only that discussions were ongoing.          "At this stage we do not have any concrete outcome," he said, adding that discussions about coronavirus countermeasures would be held "from this autumn onwards."          "Concerning the spread of the novel coronavirus, particularly the situation next summer and how the world will look like is something very ambiguous," he added.          IOC chief Thomas Bach said last month that 2021 was the "last option" for holding the Tokyo Games, stressing that postponement cannot go on forever.          He declined to say whether a vaccine was a prerequisite for going ahead with the Olympics, but was lukewarm on the idea of holding them behind closed doors.          Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has said it would be "difficult" to hold the postponed Tokyo Olympics if the coronavirus pandemic is not contained.          And Tokyo 2020 president Yoshiro Mori has said the Olympics would have to be cancelled if the coronavirus pandemic isn't brought under control by next year.                  *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

The Civil Aviation Administration of Vietnam (CAAV) has also been tasked with proposing a specific time frame for resuming the flights on a bilateral basis to restore trade and investment activities and revive the tourism industry while ensuring strict maintenance of anti-pandemic measures.          The administration will have to submit its report by June 10 for submission to Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc.          The Vietnam National Administration of Tourism (VNAT) had previously said it is eyeing to kickstart tourism again with select openings for foreign visitors. It is preparing plans to welcome visitors from countries and territories in anticipation of recovery and disease control in key markets like Southeast Asia and Northeast Asia, VNAT said.          Vietnam has suspended international flights since March 25 and banned entry of foreign nationals since March 22 except for special cases. It has also granted permission for some special flights to repatriate Vietnamese citizens stranded abroad. Domestic flights have resumed since last month.          A _Nikkei Asian Review_ report last week said Japan was gradually preparing to ease its entry restrictions on foreign visitors, with business travelers and researchers being the first to get the green light. Taiwan, Vietnam and some European countries where the Covid-19 crisis has been controlled will be considered for tourism resumption by the Japanese government, _Nikkei_ said.          Dinh Viet Thang, director of CAAV, last month said he expected the local and international aviation markets would recover by the middle and end of 2021, respectively.          The transport ministry estimates Vietnam’s aviation industry to deal with 42.7 million passengers this year, down 46 percent from last year. This is a doubling of the worst-case-scenario forecast that the ministry had made in February, which was a 23 percent drop to 61.2 million passengers.          One of the countries to have dealt with the Covid-19 pandemic most effectively, Vietnam eased its social distancing restrictions on April 23 and has allowed most "non-essential" services except karaoke parlors and discos to resume operations.          The nation with a population of 96 million people has gone 41 days without any coronavirus infections caused by community transmission. The national Covid-19 count is 327, of which 49 are active cases as 278 have recovered after treatment.          	                  *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

BENGALURU - West Ham United will play friendly matches as they look to get some match practice and regain fitness ahead of the Premier League’s restart this month, manager David Moyes said on Wednesday.          The league, which has been suspended since mid-March due to the COVID-19 pandemic, is set to resume on 17 June behind closed doors.          Clubs returned to contact training this week and they were also given the green light to play friendly matches in the coming days, with several safety protocols in place.          "We will be playing some friendlies. We'll do everything we can to prepare for the return of the Premier League," Moyes told the club website here "If you consider this a... pre-season period, most teams would have had a few friendlies under their belts.          “One thing all the clubs are not going to get is a lot of game practice, so I think getting the opportunity to do that means we can play a couple of games behind closed doors.”          Matches will be refereed by club coaching staff while venues must not be more than 90 minutes away.          “We’re all following the guidelines while we’re in a position where we don’t want anything to go wrong in the lead up to the restart of the Premier League,” Moyes added.                  *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

The critical patient, Le Tuyet Hang, was admitted to Hanoi’s National Hospital of Tropical Diseases for Covid-19 treatment on March 7. She has undergone the longest treatment of all novel coronavirus infections recorded so far in the country, at more than 80 days, and has been one of its most critical cases.          For 17 days she became full reliant on the life support machine called Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) that allows her lungs and hearts to function properly.          Her heart suddenly stopped one night on April 7, forcing doctors to defibrillate her and perform other emergency procedures continuously for 40 minutes.          Hang was infected by her 26-year-old niece, Nguyen Hong Nhung, who was confirmed positive with Covid-19 on March 6, four days after she returned to Hanoi from London. Nhung’s case ended Vietnam’s 22-day streak of no new Covid-19 infection at the time          By Tuesday, Hang had tested negative seven times. Now she is in stable condition and can walk by herself, something she found very difficult to do two weeks ago.          "Though she has recovered from Covid-19 and been able to breathe and walk normally, the virus has caused a lot of damage to her body and she still has to take a lot of medicine," said Vu Dinh Phu, head of the hospital’s resuscitation department.          The cost for treating Hang has been estimated at VND2-3 billion ($85,700-126,600). All Vietnamese citizens having Covid-19 are treated for free.          Nguyen Van Kinh, head of the board in charge of treating Covid-19 patients at the Health Ministry, said the recovery of Hang was a "remarkable feat."          "On seeing that she has beaten the disease and cheated death, all doctors and I are over the moon," he said.          Luu Ngoc, 40, Hang’s son, said he and his brother had been "extremely worried and scared."          "Her heart used to stop and we were desperate. We've counted on the doctors every day for our mother to overcome the disease," he said.          The day his mother came out of a coma, Ngoc and his brother asked Hang if she could recognize them. As she nodded, the two felt huge relief.          "Thanks to the care and treatment of doctors and nurses, our mother is much better. We have been under a lot of strain," Ngoc said.          Among the other five cases confirmed to have recovered Wednesday, four are Vietnamese returning from abroad via repatriation flights and one a relapse case.          Of the returnees, three had returned from Russia on May 13 and the other returned from the U.S. on May 16.          All recovered patients will be monitored at the hospital for another 14 more days.          Vietnam now has 49 active Covid-19 patients, 278 of the total 327 cases recorded so far having recovered.          	                  *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange
