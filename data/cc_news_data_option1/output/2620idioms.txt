 LONDON, July 4 (Reuters) - Serpentine produced an electrifying display of front-running to claim a shock win at the Epsom Derby on Saturday as Aidan O'Brien became the most successful trainer in the history of the famous flat race.
 The 25-1 shot opened up a huge lead on the field and they could not respond as Serpentine, ridden by Emmet McNamara, never looked like being caught.
 There were no spectators to witness it, however, with the re-scheduled race being run behind closed doors because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Had there been, they might have been stunned into silence as Serpentine only won his first race a week ago.
 Pre-race favourites English King and Kameko were run out of contention with Khalifa Sat (50-1) finishing second and Amhran Na Bhfiann (66-1) third in one of the most surprising results in the race's recent history.
 "I think I got a bit of a freebie really," McNamara said. "It is surreal really I can't believe it. I just have a huge amount of gratitude for Aidan O'Brien."
 It completed a memorable day for O'Brien who earlier celebrated victory in the Oaks when Love came home first.
 The Oaks and Derby were run on the same day for the first time in their history as a result of the pandemic which shutdown horse racing from March to June.
 The 241st running of the derby, the most prestigious flat race in the sport, will always be remembered for the eerie atmosphere that replaced the usual carnival which attracts 100,000 punters to the course and thousands more to the surrounding Downs.
 Rather than the usual wall of sound at the finish line, McNamara sped to victory in silence. "I couldn't hear anything, all I could hear was the horse breathing," he said. "I couldn't really look, but I knew I was clear."
 It was the first winning ride for McNamara since October.
 "I was saving myself," he joked.
 It continued an incredible few weeks for O'Brien since the resumption of racing as Love also won the 1,000 Guineas.
 Due to strict health protocols which meant only a limited amount of people were allowed at the course, O'Brien watched the action remotely on TV.
 "He has great pedigree, we always felt that he was going to stay very well," he said. "It was an incredible ride by Emmet." (Reporting by Martyn Herman, editing by Ed Osmond and Christian Radnedge)

My fellow libertarians and many conservatives rightly prioritize freedom. We are especially skeptical of government mandates restricting our choices for, supposedly, our own good. We oppose "nanny state" paternalism, or "parentalism" as I call it.
   
 A government of the people should treat adults like adults, not children.
   
 This view was perhaps best expressed by the great 19th century writer John Stuart Mill. His influential book, "On Liberty," says "the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant."
   
 So, if government requirements to wear a mask were mostly for your own good, then you would have solid grounds to oppose the mandate and to make your own choices. But mask-mandates are not primarily about protecting wearer of the mask. In fact, mask-mandates are mostly about protecting others from the wearer of the mask.
   
 You might believe you are not sick and thus wonder why anyone needs protection from you spreading a virus you do not have. But suppose you cannot know if you have the COVID-19 virus. Suppose some infected people never experience symptoms but spread the virus to those who do. And suppose many spread the virus in the day or two before experiencing symptoms.
   
 These suppositions may be true to varying degrees, and a commitment to freedom cannot help us determine how true they are. Only a commitment to science can. Science advances by gathering information, and scientists' views change as new information comes to light.
   
 If the available information tends to suggest that COVID-19 is often spread by people who do not realize they are infected, then government requiring you to wear a mask is not restricting your choices for your own good. A mask requirement is restricting your choices to, perhaps unknowingly, engage in behavior that risks harming others.
   
 In that sense, a mask requirement is less like a seatbelt law designed to protect the wearer and more like a law against driving under the influence of alcohol. Many deaths have been caused by drunken drivers who did not intend to harm anyone, and many of those drivers likely did not even realize they were dangerous.
   
 Similarly, science may be discovering that many of us endanger those around us even when we do not realize we are dangerous because we are not yet experiencing COVID-19 symptoms, although we have been infected and are contagious.
   
 COVID-19 raises the possibility that each of us is, without knowing it, like the dangerously intoxicated person getting into the drivers' seat. Except, as our progressive friends need to be reminded, roads and sidewalks are government property, while stores and most workplaces are private property.
   
 The extent to which private businesses should be coerced by government rather than incentivized by customers and employees is the key policy issue to debate.

"Right now, Messi's idea is to finish his contract in 2021 and leave Barcelona. Messi has stalled on the extension of his contract. Negotiations had started very well, with a good understanding between the two parties, but recent events have made Messi reconsider everything."
 Asked about suggestions Messi plans to leave Barcelona, coach Quique Setien said on Saturday: "I won't speculate about this because I haven't heard from him so I'm not aware of him saying anything.
 "I see him well, everything else is speculation that I won't get involved in. We speak about what we have to speak about and nothing else."
 Barcelona play away at in-form Villarreal on Sunday evening. Real Madrid could by then have extended their lead at the top of the table. They face Athletic Bilbao a few hours earlier.
 Real manager Zinedine Zidane was asked about Messi's potential departure on Thursday.
 "I don't know what will happen but we hope not because he is in this league and we want the best in this league," said Zidane.
 Messi said in February he did not believe Barcelona could win the Champions League on current form.
 The 33-year-old has also had regular disagreements with the club's board, headed by president Josep Maria Bartomeu.
 Messi reacted publicly when sporting director Eric Abidal appeared to blame the players for the sacking of Ernesto Valverde in January.
 He also led the fightback from the players over the dispute with the board in March regarding pay cuts during the coronavirus pandemic.
 "We cannot help but be surprised that from within the club there are those trying to put us under the microscope or apply pressure for us to do something that we have always been clear that we would do," said Messi.
 Barcelona's presidential elections are due to be held in 2021, when Bartomeu will have to step aside.
 Among those set to run is Victor Font, who wants to appoint Messi's former team-mate Xavi Hernandez as coach.
 Yet Barca's form, as well as suggestions of unrest in the dressing room, have placed scrutiny on Setien's job in the short-term.
 He has a contract until 2022, with a break clause in 2021, but it is to be seen if he is in charge for next season, or even the Champions League in August.
 "I have experienced it other times," said Setien, when asked about the uncertainty. "It is not something I can control. This the circus that we are in and we accept it. "I don't exhaust myself by reading or listening to the noise around me."
 Xavi replacing Setien would reinvigorate Messi, and perhaps the team, but the Spaniard is unlikely to take charge while Bartomeu is still in place. That means Xavi would have to wait at least another year.

 Messi's reluctance to continue contract negotiations could be a political ploy aimed at undermining the current board further. But at 33, he also does not have time to waste.
 Unless Barcelona unexpectedly go all the way next month, it will be five years since the world's best player has won the Champions League. Both Messi and Europe's elite clubs will be aware he deserves better.

It passed by a very narrow margin.
 The proposal got 50.48% of the vote, a margin of about 6,500.
 But with state questions it doesn’t matter if the margin is one vote or one million, the effect is the same.
 After a decade of arguing about it, Medicaid expansion is coming to Oklahoma. We’ll be the 37th state to go that way, one of five to do it by direct action of the voters.
 The irony of democracy is that rural counties, which probably stand to gain most from the vote, rejected SQ 802. Seven urban, suburban and collegiate counties gave enough of a margin to carry the day over the state’s 70 least densely populated areas.
 One of the most important potential impacts of Medicaid expansion is financial stability for the state’s rural hospitals.
 In the past 10 years, 120 rural U.S. hospitals have closed. Eight of them were in Oklahoma. More are teetering. A 2019 court filing by the Oklahoma Hospital Association and other SQ 802 proponents says that 17 rural Oklahoma hospitals are at risk of closing and 54% of the state’s rural hospitals have a negative operating profit margin.

In an industry where the hero’s name invariably preceded that of the heroine’s, and often decided the box-office fate of a film, Saroj Khan knew she was in for a battle of attrition. No female dance choreographer had been allowed to occupy centre stage in Hindi cinema until then.
 Saroj Khan came well prepared for the battle. Having honed her skills under B. Sohanlal, done her bit as a child artist, and been a group dancer in _Howrah Bridge_ in 1958, she signed her first film as an independent choreographer only in 1974 with _Geetaa Mera Naam_ , starring __ Sadhna _,_ Sunil Dutt and Feroz Khan.
 However, she had to wait until the 1980s to come into her own with films such as _Mr India_ , _Nagina_ , _Tezaab_ and _Sailaab_. If Sridevi waltzed to the top with “Hawa hawai” and “Kaate nahin kat te”, both choreographed by Saroj Khan, in _Mr India_ (1987), she soon had competition from Madhuri Dixit who did not put a foot wrong in the high-octane number “Ek, do, teen” in _Tezaab_ (1988).
 Life turned full circle. In a male-dominated industry, Saroj Khan came to be called “Masterji”, a term, like Ustad and Pandit, otherwise reserved for men. Then came films such as _Beta_ , _Khalnayak_ , _Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge_ , _Mohra_ , _Taal_ and _Thanedaar,_ followed in later years by _Jab We Met_ , _Guru_ and _Delhi 6_ , __ and culminating in _Kalank_.
 Saroj Khan shaped the careers of several leading ladies in Hindi cinema from the 1980s onwards but was not dependent on them, as she proved with the pulsating number “Dola re Dola” in Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s _Devdas_ (2002), in which she brought Madhuri Dixit and Aishwarya Rai together.
 There was more to Saroj Khan than commercial Hindi films. She judged talent shows on television, and directed theatre. Importantly, when Sharada Ramanathan made _Sringaram–Dance of Love_ (2007), a film based on Bharatanatyam and with a devadasi as protagonist, set to music by the classical doyen Lalgudi G. Jayaraman, it was Saroj Khan she chose as the choreographer. The film won the National Film Award for Best Choreography. In a career of over four decades, Saroj Khan choreographed as many as 2,000 songs and won three National awards.
 Such an illustrious career could not be without a touch of controversy. In 2018, she seemed to defend the casting couch, but later apologised for her statement. Likewise, in an interview to _The Hindu_ in 2010, she was candid about the actor Sridevi’s lack of rhythm: “I still remember the shooting of ‘Maine Rab Se Tujhe Maang Liya’. There were 13 retakes. ... We always needed four boys around her to keep her on the beat.”
 That was Saroj Khan, the one who slogged long hours and shed sweat to create groundbreaking dance numbers. A woman with a mind of her own, fearless enough to express her thoughts whose exhilarating journey was brought to an abrupt end with her death by cardiac arrest on July 3.

 What does it mean to be the United States of America?
 What does it mean to be one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all?
 What does it mean to let freedom ring from every mountainside?
 And what does it mean to be in this county at this time, confronting unparalleled division and vitriol, while a pandemic rages around us?
 This Fourth of July, perhaps we should understand that the meaning of this country is not barbecue and fireworks. It's not closely packed concert halls and teeming bars. The meaning of this country is in every one of us, devoted to the project of creating a more perfect union.
 Some might wonder if this is ever possible. Can a nation founded with one race of people enslaved ever truly recover its moral authority? Can a country where wealth was created by forced labor ever truly tell those it abused that they are free?
 Not all of these questions can be answered. Some of them aren't meant to be.
 But our country's founders created ingenious mechanisms for change. They created elected branches that are chosen by voters. They created a Constitution that can be amended and altered -- and has been so altered -- to expand freedom.
 And we have always been prepared to sacrifice. Those of all races, colors and creeds have fought to protect the United States. We are ever in their favor but especially on this day.
 We all have to sacrifice now. During the current pandemic crisis, that means wearing masks and practicing social distancing. That means staying home.
 These are small things. They aren't storming a beach at Normandy or leading a revolutionary charge against the British. But they are no less patriotic. They're about putting others in this country ahead of your immediate self interest -- about creating a United States.
 The questions won't go away.
 We're heading into another contentious election season, one that will look unlike any in memory. The temptation will be strong to look the other way, to shut out the noise. But our system only works when everyone participates and elects a truly representative government.
 There is so much to be cynical and angry about.
 We've seen it. Sometimes, we feel it.
 But we can't ignore what this country has accomplished. How far we have all come. How many more people are included, proudly, as full Americans. That's a measure of success. Not how many flags we put up or fireworks we detonate.
 We are this country. This country is us. Its success, its continued thriving, is in our hands.

Kyler Kaniper took the term multi-sport athlete to an elite level for Silver Lake, standing out for the Eagles in four sports.
   
 But while Kaniper is proud of what he was able to accomplish in cross country, football, basketball and track and field during his high school career, he doesn't want to brag about it.
   
 "I don't want to sound cocky, but I just feel like I'm good at a lot of different stuff and I want to be able to use all my talents,'' said Kaniper, named the 2020 Topeka Shawnee County male athlete of the year.
   
 Kaniper was the Class 3A individual runner-up in last fall's state cross country meet, leading the Eagles to a second-place team finish, while starting as a slotback and cornerback for the 10-1 Silver Lake football team, earning All-Mid-East League honors and All-2A honorable mention.
   
 Kaniper was also a starter in basketball and would have been one of 3A's top returners in track after earning a state medal as a junior before that sport was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
   
 "I was close to being a five-sport guy,'' he said. "I almost did baseball and track (in the spring). I did it my freshman year, but I started to not like baseball and I liked track a lot, so I just focused on track.''
   
 The most challenging part of Kaniper's year was doubling up in football and cross county in the fall after joining the Eagles' cross country team as a junior and senior.
   
 "The first year I did it, it was very tiring with both practices,'' Kaniper said. "I wasn't used to getting up so early in the morning and then staying out so late for football practice.
   
 "The second year it wasn't as hard, but when I had a football game one night and then I had a (cross country) meet early the next morning, I'd be pretty sore, but it wasn't too bad. My cross country coaches and teammates were scared I'd get hurt in a football game, but I did not get hurt.''
   
 After having his high school career halted in mid-March by the coronavirus, Kaniper has now turned his attention to getting ready for his college career in cross country and track for Washburn.
   
 "I was looking forward to this last year of track in high school, but it didn't happen, so I've just got to look forward to the future and try to do my best in college,'' Kaniper said.
   
 "I feel like now that I'll only have one sport at a time I'll be able to run more and farther and I'm just going to get that much better.''
   
 As he prepares for his next step, Kaniper also has nothing but fond memories of his days at Silver Lake.
   
 "I loved it,'' he said. "My favorite season was fall because I loved football so much and I loved cross country just as much.
   
 "I was really happy to get out there and do multiple stuff and be around a lot of different people. I just had fun with everybody I was involved with.''

 “When a quarterback gets an Oklahoma offer – there have been very few over the last three or four years – you know that guy is one of the absolute top two or three quarterbacks in the country because Lincoln Riley has proven himself as not only able to land the best players he wants, but also to identify the guys that maybe not everybody was over the moon about.”
 McCuistion pointed out that Rattler was offered a scholarship early by Riley because he saw his potential. Williams was also approached early by Riley.
 “From a recruiting perspective, the only thing (this run) takes a back seat to is what they’re doing on the field with all the Heisman Trophy winners and the finalists,” McCuistion said. “One feeds the other.”

But at 33, he also does not have time to waste.Unless Barcelona unexpectedly go all the way next month, it will be five years since the world's best player has won the Champions League. Both Messi and Europe's elite clubs will be aware he deserves better.",

 When Abbey Karnes first found out about diabetic alert dogs, it became her dream to have one. Diagnosed at the age of 12 with Type 1 diabetes, Abbey learned early on that managing this lifelong disease would be difficult. Luckily, Abbey was recently partnered with her diabetic alert dog, Darby, through Pawsitive Perspectives Assistance Dogs (PawPADS).
 Abbey’s mom, Jessica, explained what it means for Abbey to have Type 1 diabetes.
 “Because Abbey is a Type 1 Diabetic, she has no control in her pancreas function. Her immune system has attacked and damaged her pancreas making it dysfunctional,” Jessica said. “She will always have to live with taking insulin unless there's a cure.”
 Over the years, Abbey has been able to manage her disease but at times her blood sugar will spike or drop for no apparent reason. Her mom described times where Abbey has experienced low blood sugars where she hasn’t been able to think or speak clearly. At a certain point, these low levels could lead to loss of consciousness, seizures and even death. On the other side, Abbey can experience high blood sugar, known as hyperglycemia, and become extremely ill. An alert dog is able to help by giving warnings for when Abbey’s blood sugar is fluctuating.
 “Diabetic alert dogs can alert to dropping blood sugar from 10-40 minutes before my CGM (continuous glucose monitoring) technology can,” Abbey explained. “So they catch it much faster with their sensitive nose. If I do get too low and faint my dog is trained to get help, even if it is a stranger.”
 But there is more to Abbey than Type 1 diabetes. From Grand Rapids and currently attending Itasca Community College through post-secondary enrollment options (PSEO), Abbey loves acting, crafting and dancing competitively.
 “She is a competitive dancer and a straight-A student taking college classes during her high school years,” Jessica commented. “She is one of the most determined and focused people I know, despite all that she has to deal with. I have no doubts that she will go on to make a positive difference in this world and she already has proven that.”
 Seeing her daughter succeed in so many areas, her parents never wanted to hold her back from her dreams. But with college in the future, having to manage everything on her own in a new place was worrisome.
 “It is a fear that you can't explain as a parent,” Jessica said. “Type 1 diabetes can be life-threatening every day, even every hour, but we never wanted it to hold her back from her dreams and goals.”
 Then one day Abbey came to her parents to show them a PowerPoint presentation she had made about diabetic alert dogs.
 “My whole life I have been scared of needles which is ironic because I am a diabetic that deals with needles almost every day. So getting the courage to put my pump site in or give myself an injection can be hard to do,” said Abbey. “I noticed whenever our family dog, Macy came near me it helped. That is one reason why I wanted an alert dog”.”
 Abbey and her family did extensive research to find a high-quality company to work with. They came across PawPADs, a small nonprofit service dog training organization based in Lakeville, Minn.. After going through an extensive application process, Abbey was notified that she was chosen to have an interview with the founder and executive director of PawPADs Linda Ball. Next the PawPADS board met and decided to accept Abbey as their next client.
 “PawPADS has treated me like family since we put in the application. They want me to have a personal connection with the alert dog. They also treat their dogs like family which made me very excited to work with them,” said Abbey.
 Before being accepted, PawPADS brought their dogs in training to one of Abbey’s dance competitions. This was the first time Abbey met her current alert dog, Darby.
 “They told me that she was good with scent, but didn't really care to do it. I figured she wasn't going to be my dog for that reason, but as soon as I met her again during the partner training camp I knew she was a match for me,” Abbey added.
 PawPADs train dogs from when they are 8 weeks old until they are at least 2 years old. Training is done through the ADEPT program, created by PawPADS, which gives college students the change to learn how to train service dogs. Abbey and her family made a trip to the University of Wisconsin River Falls to meet the trainers.
 “These college students are amazing and essential to the success of these service animals. They devote time, love, and energy to training these special companions, all while going to college themselves,” Jessica explained. “They teach the necessary skills for the dogs to become service animals, including diabetic scent detection. Each service dog has its own unique qualities that make them better at different jobs, just like people do. Abbey needed one who had a very special nose, and that loved to work.”
 Before taking Darby home, Abbey attended the 11-day Partner Training Camp in June. There other clients and parents came to meet their service animals. Clients and families went through public access trips and 80 hours of classroom training. Topics ranged from groom, what the clients will experience in public, their rights according to the law, how to train the dogs, medical information and much more. While Abbey worked with three different dogs for the first two days of camp, Darby and Abbey had an immediate connection.
 “We truly believe Darby had chosen her,” Jessica commented. “She made it clear she wanted Abbey to be her person. It was beautiful. On the 3rd day of camp, the clients were told which dog would be theirs. Abbey's new best friend and partner was Darby.”
 Darby was able to start alerting Abbey of her high and low blood sugars immediately. Abbey explained how different chemical scents are released from her body when she is experiencing high or low blood sugar levels. Darby is able to smell these and can also tell if Abbey’s blood sugar is fluctuating quickly.
 “There was one moment that Abbey was pretending to pass out in the hallway and Darby ran to get help from a person,” said Jessica. “It brought me to tears. It was a realization, that I could let go of some of my fears of Abbey moving away to college and life. Darby had her back, she would take care of her, keep her healthy, and love up on her when she was having a bad day.”
 Jessica continued, “We are forever grateful to PawPADS and the ADEPT trainers. Their professionalism exceeded our expectations, but most of all their heart. We know they will always support Abbey and Darby. They truly want a happy healthy life for their service dogs and for their clients. We can't thank you enough. We are blessed to be a part of your family!”

 “We want to say a special thank you to those who have supported us on this journey this past year and a half,” Jessica stated. “Thank you family, friends and our community for donating to this cause and helping Abbey to bring her diabetic alert dog home. Thank you to the Greenway Lion's Club for your generous donation to help us reach her goal. We hope in the near future you will see Abbey somewhere in the community with Darby and it will bring a smile to your face. We are forever grateful for all of your support!”
 As for Abbey and Darby, it seems as though they were meant to be together.
 ‘She has a very similar personality to me,” Abbey noted. “She is very determined and loves to train. She also loves to snuggle which is something I really hoped for in a dog.”

Business class (or first class) passengers traveling on a British Airways or a Oneworld flight. This policy applies to flights on the same day. So whilst most passengers will simply access a lounge before their flight, if you have a connecting flight later on the same day in business or first class but the immediate flight is in economy, you'll be given lounge access if you present your onward boarding pass. The same applies the other way around, for example, if you landed in London on a Club World flight and are connecting on to Amsterdam in economy, you are entitled to access the lounge. The caveat here is that reception staff can be known for making up rules or not understanding the full access rules and thus by simply looking at your upcoming boarding pass in economy, deny access.
