An Associated Press analysis, meanwhile, found that U.S. infection rates outside the New York City area are in fact rising, notably in rural areas. It found New York's progress against the virus was overshadowing increasing infections elsewhere.
 “Make no mistakes: This virus is still circulating in our community, perhaps even more now than in previous weeks,” said Linda Ochs, director of the Health Department in Shawnee County, Kansas.
 The virus is known to have infected more than 3.6 million and killed more than 251,000 people, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins that all experts agree is an undercount due to limited testing, uneven victim criteria and deliberate concealment by some governments.
 The U.S. has seen over 71,000 deaths amid its 1.2 million infections, and Europe has endured over 144,000 reported coronavirus deaths. Behind each of those vast numbers is a family in pain.
 “Burying both parents at the same time? It’s hard,” said Desmond Tolbert, who lost his mother and father in rural southwest Georgia. Because they had the virus, he couldn’t be with them when they died.
 U.S. President Donald Trump, with his eye on being reelected in November, is pushing hard to ease state stay-at-home orders and resuscitate the U.S. economy, which has seen over 30 million workers lose their jobs in less than two months.

Fame comes fast and furious on TikTok, which uses a powerful algorithm to excavate someone from anonymity and turn them into an overnight sensation. A year ago, D'Amelio had yet to post her first TikTok video. Now, she has the potential to earn millions and a team of agents, managers and lawyers working tirelessly behind the scenes. Though the nature of internet virality is that it can disappear as quickly as it arrives, there's evidence to suggest -- and a growing faction in Hollywood who are mobilizing to ensure -- that TikTok stars like D'Amelio won't be fleeting. "There's something happening here," says D'Amelio's agent, Ali Berman, who as co-head of digital talent at UTA has spent the better part of the past decade molding the careers of the internet famous. "This is definitely a place to discover new talent."

The transfer value of players in 10 of Europe's top leagues could plummet by up to 10 billion euros due to the economic crash caused by coronavirus, a study from accounting firm KPMG said on Wednesday.
 Transfer spending is expected to fall dramatically, with clubs across the continent facing huge losses as a result of football's shutdown.
 The top divisions in England, Germany, Italy and Spain remain committed to trying to finish the 2019/20 seasons so they can honour huge TV contracts and minimise the financial hit.
 KPMG estimates that Europe's top five leagues, including France, where the season has ended, could lose four billion euros ($4.3 billion) if the campaigns cannot be completed.
   
   
 Those leagues are also the main drivers of the European transfer market. The study also looked at the top leagues in Belgium, the Netherlands, Portugal and Turkey and England's second-tier Championship.
 With little money to spend, values could fall by nearly 10 billion if there is no more football this season -- the "worst-case" scenario.
 They could still plummet by 6.6 billion euros if leagues were completed behind closed doors. That modelling was based on all 10 leagues being completed, even though seasons in France and the Netherlands have been ended.
 "Our recent analysis reveals that the aggregate value of all the 4,183 players in the 10 European leagues under consideration decreased by a total of almost EUR 10 billion, a 26.5 percent drop since February for Scenario 1," said KPMG's latest Football Benchmark report.
 "Players' values would decrease by EUR 6.6 billion, a 17.7 percent decrease in Scenario 2."
 Paris Saint-Germain players Kylian Mbappe and Neymar are still the two most valuable players according to the report, but the number of players worth over 100 million euros would shrink from 15 before the pandemic to just eight if seasons were not completed.
 The lack of cash could, though, see clubs becoming more creative with swap deals.
 "Financial constraints are likely to lead to a decrease both in the volume of transactions and in the transfer fees, and to an increase in the number of swap and loan deals," the report added.

The mass exodus of migrant labourers to their respective native places by special trains arranged by the Telangana government has cast a shadow on the real estate sector in the state, particularly for Rs 45,000 crore worth of projects that have been in the works in and around the state capital, Hyderabad.Over five lakh migrant workers have been stranded in Telangana due to nationwide lockdown restrictions, which were initially enforced for 21 days from March 25 and then further extended for another 19 days till May 3 to contain the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) disease. Majority of the migrant workers to Telangana are construction labourers - both skilled and unskilled -- who are engaged in various real estate projects and construction activities.These workers are returning to their native places, particularly to Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh (UP), Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh (MP) and Chhattisgarh, in batches. While the first batch of 1,200 construction labourers left for their native places in Jharkhand from Hyderabad last Friday, the Telangana government has arranged to ferry the rest of them by arranging special trains.On Tuesday, 12 special trains, carrying over 15,000 migrant labourers, left for their native places. On Wednesday morning, another three trains, carrying over 4,000 labourers, departed from Hyderabad. "We had made arrangements for running 40 special trains daily for one week for these stranded migrant labourers. But some of the states, where these labourers belong to, requested us to go slow, as they need to make adequate arrangements for transporting them to their native villages. Besides, they need to be mandatorily quarantined for two weeks," Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao told media persons on Tuesday night.Rao said of the five lakh-odd stranded migrant workers in Telangana, over three lakhs are involved in the real estate sector and other construction activities. "The construction activities have just started. I had suggested that they stay back in Telangana and we'd take care of them. But, they're free to return to their native places, as they had wished," he said.The real estate industry in Hyderabad, which saw a boom over the last year, is feeling the heat due to the return of the migrant labourers to their respective native places. "Over 80% of the workforce in the real estate sector comprises migrant workers, particularly from Bihar, Jharkhand, UP, Rajasthan and MP. This en masse exodus of the workers will hamper the projects, especially those that are in the final stages of construction and more so, as the constriction activities have just resumed after weeks of lockdown restrictions," said V Rajasekhar Reddy, general secretary of Confederation of Real Estate Developers' Associations of India (CREDAI), Telangana chapter.Reddy blamed the Centre for its hasty move in allowing migrant labourers to return to their native places amid lockdown restrictions that are still in place in some parts of the country. "It's a risky business for everybody. We don't know whether and when they would come back to resume work. Even if they come back after a month or two, there is every possibility that they could have contracted SARS- CoV-2 that causes Covid-19 in their native places," he said.Telangana Real Estate Developers Association (TREDA), estimated that projects, both residential and commercial, measuring around 300 million square feet, are being held up in and around Hyderabad."Assuming that the average basic construction cost is around Rs 1,500 per square feet, around Rs 45,000 crore is locked up in these unfinished projects," R Chalapathi Rao, president, TREDA, told HT.C Sekhar Reddy, convener for infrastructure and real estate wing of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Telangana chapter, however, pointed out that real estate ventures that are in the initial stages of completion would be hit the hardest."The builder will suffer massive losses due to lack of manpower, escalating input costs such as steel, cement and other materials and also an acute fund crunch," he said.Rao hopes that even if 50% of the migrant labourers return after two months, normalcy will be restored in the real estate sector. "We can pool in skilled manpower from the National Academy of Construction and engage local labourers in the interim, apart from adopting the latest technology. We're hopeful that the sector will regain normalcy and buoyancy within the next six months," the TREDA president added.
