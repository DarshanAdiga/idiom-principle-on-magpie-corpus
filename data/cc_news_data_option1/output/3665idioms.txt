The alleged assailant, Antonio Dejesus, 33, of Wilmington, Delaware, was jailed Monday, awaiting an initial appearance on first-degree robbery and malicious assault charges.
 Clarksburg Police Chief Mark Kiddy noted "the current charges can be upgraded. During the investigation, whatever comes about, those charges will probably be upgraded."
 Dejesus was running from an alleged disturbance Sunday at the Hardee's located off U.S. 50 on the east side of Clarksburg prior to the shooting, Kiddy said.
 Dejesus also had been wanted at the time on a petition to revoke his federal supervised release. That had been filed Sept. 11, according to Chief Deputy U.S. Marshal Terry Moore.
 "We had received calls just prior to the incident of a suspicious person, and we believe he was just trying to flee the scene to keep from being apprehended by police," Kiddy said.
 Dejesus pulled a gun and ordered Malfregeot's wife, 62, to drive away from the area with him and her 88-year-old mother on board, Clarksburg Detective Sgt. Bill Swiger has alleged.
 "Ms. Malfregeot was taking her mother home to her residence. She had been over to eat dinner. She was pulling out of her driveway when it occurred," Kiddy said. "When he fled the area around Hardee's, he traveled that direction and just happened to meet the vehicle when it was coming out of the driveway. Just an opportunity-type thing."
 Added Mayor Kennedy: "Councilman Malfregeot heard the screams of his wife and mother-in-law and attempted to stop the individual. In doing so, Councilman Malfregeot was shot once .... The individual then forced Councilman Malfregeot's wife and mother-in-law to drive from the scene. They were later forced out of the vehicle in the area of Crooked Run Road."
 Dejesus was apprehended without incident at the parking lot of the Black Bear Express on Saltwell Road by Harrison deputies and Bridgeport police officers, officials said.

Google's YouTube announced Monday that it is rolling out YouTube Shorts "is a new short-form video experience for creators and artists who want to shoot short, catchy videos using nothing but their mobile phones," according to a company blog post.
 Shorts videos will be 15 seconds or less and will allow users to use a new, multi-segment camera to stitch multiple clips together as well as the option to record video with music from a selection of songs, similar to how users can create TikTok videos. Shorts has reportedly been in the works for a while, according to an April report from The Information, but Google did not confirm the new feature at the time.
 YouTube did not immediate respond to Business Insider's request for comment.
 Shorts will get a beta release in India this week for testing. India banned TikTok as well as dozens of other apps owned by China-based firms in June, citing national security concerns.

As of right now, Sally is forecast to make landfall either Tuesday or Wednesday somewhere near the Louisiana-Mississippi state line. The average forecast track error from the NHC (48 hours out) is about 80 miles, so it is too early to determine exactly where the center of Sally will hit directly. The NHC cautions that people along the coast should not focus on the specific details of the track, but rather the overall impact of the storm.


  The big takeaway from this storm is the dangerous amount of water. The NHC is calling for "life-threatening storms surge and flash flooding." The highest storm surge is expected to be just to the east of where Sally makes landfall. Right now the NHC is forecasting 7 to 11 feet of storm surge from the mouth of the Mississippi River east to Ocean Springs, Mississippi, including Lake Borgne. Rising waters from the surge is expected to be felt as far west as Burns Point, Louisiana, and as far east as Saint Andrews Bay, Florida.


  Besides storm surge, extreme amounts of rainfall are also forecast for some locations. Widespread rainfall totals along the Gulf Coast from Louisiana to the panhandle of Florida are forecast to be between 6 to 10 inches; however, some cities could see up to 2 feet of rainfall. This amount of rainfall will lead to life-threatening flash flooding including major urban and river flooding as well.


  Tropical Storm Teddy is currently in the central Atlantic, well over 1,000 miles east of the Lesser Antilles. Teddy is expected to strengthen to a hurricane over the next few days. If this occurs, Teddy will be the eighth hurricane of this year's Atlantic Hurricane Season, behind Sally. Sally became a hurricane Monday, according to a tweet from the NHC.


  By the end of the week Teddy is forecast to become a major hurricane (Category 3 or higher) as it approaches Bermuda. It is too early to tell at this time whether it will directly hit Bermuda, but given the current track it will be something to watch in the coming days.


  Tropical Storm Vicky is currently over the eastern Atlantic, just a few hundred miles west of the Cabo Verde Islands. Vicky is the earliest 20th Atlantic named storm on record, breaking the previous record set by Tammy on October 5, 2005.


  Vicky is expected to encounter unfavorable conditions in the next couple of days, which will limit its growth and intensification by Tuesday.


  "The cyclone is expected to degenerate into a remnant low by Tuesday night, and then dissipate over water on Friday, if not sooner," the NHC said in their forecast discussion.

Obviously the audience for these articles includes both those that can read between the lines and those that accept the stories at face-value, but the real interest here is the fact that these digs are being made at all. If it were just the usual suspects within the British press I'd say that perhaps their typical clickbait isn't generating enough revenue, so the media is trying to adjust their approach without rocking the boat too much. However, Tatler is seemingly also getting in on the game, with their not-so-secret removal of that paragraph followed by the 'beloved artists' and 'royal mistresses' stories, and Tatler is usually above the fray of the pedestrian battle for clicks. Therefore, to me this indicates that the press smells blood in the water and is circling their prey. Let's watch and see what (or who) the royals try to use as chum.

Just recently there has been some new debate on my 2020 book, _The Rendlesham Forest UFO Conspiracy_. No doubt, it's because the 40th anniversary of the case is getting closer and closer. Indeed, I'm sure that when December of this year comes around we'll be seeing a lot of debate concerning the incident(s). As for that new debate, it revolves around the specific issue of why I am so sure that the Rendlesham affair was a secret experiment, rather than an extraterrestrial event. There is one thing that surfaces over and over again in the story. It's the matter of drugs. And nothing less than mind-altering drugs. Take a look at most UFO events and you'll see witness testimony, documentation, and sometimes photos. It's rare that drugs surface in relation to UFOs. In the Rendlesham Forest case, however, they are all over the place. Let's take a look at the evidence. In my book, I point out that one of the key installations involved in the experiments was the Maryland-based Edgewood Arsenal. _Fortwiki_ provides the following history on the Edgewood Arsenal: "A chemical weapons arsenal established in 1917 and located in the present day Edgewood area of the Aberdeen Proving Ground. The Edgewood area is about 13,000 acres on the west side of the Bush River that was used for the development and testing of chemical agent munitions. This area was originally a separate U.S. Army installation known as Edgewood Arsenal until October 1971 when it merged with Aberdeen Proving Ground and became the Edgewood Area of Aberdeen Proving Ground."

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — Andrew Gillum, Florida's Democratic nominee for governor in 2018, told a television interviewer he is bisexual, responding to rumors swirling since March when he was found intoxicated in a hotel room with two men, including one who works as a male escort. “I don't identify as gay but I do identify as bisexual,” Gillum told Tamron Hall on her syndicated talk show, which aired Monday. “And that is something that I have never shared publicly before.” The former Tallahassee mayor, 41, appeared on the show with his wife, R. Jai. They have three young children. He did not immediately return a call Monday from The Associated Press seeking comment. Gillum was an upset winner of the Democratic gubernatorial primary in 2018 and was the first African American to be nominated for the office by the two major parties. Gillum was found in a Miami Beach hotel room at 1 a.m. March 13 by paramedics responding to a drug overdose, police said then. Police say Gillum and two other men were in the hotel room. They said Gillum and Travis Dyson, 30, were apparently under the influence of an “unknown substance.” Rescuers began chest compressions on Dyson and he was taken to a hospital, where he recovered. “Mr. Gillum was unable to communicate because of his inebriated state,” the police report said. They said they found baggies of suspected crystal methamphetamine. Gillum later said he was drunk, but did not use meth. Gillum had stable medical signs and was allowed to leave. He was not charged with a crime. One of the men he was with advertised online as a male escort. Gillum announced two days later that he was entering a rehabilitation facility, saying he had fallen into depression and alcohol abuse after narrowly losing the governor's race. . ..

Those who work with feral hogs want to see evidence that early prevention can work to save money and ecosystems. “Twenty years ago, an investment of $300,000 would have been huge in Saskatchewan,” says Brook, who emphasizes the value of mobilizing as early as possible. With other regions across North American at risk of feral swine taking hold — including North Dakota and Canada’s Yukon Territory — evidence that early investments can work really matter. “Prevention is critical in those areas where no feral pigs are established,” says Zimmer. “It’s definitely better to get ahead of the curve.”

Kumbulla was part of a strong Verona side before the coronavirus pandemic suspended world football with the club conceding 26 goals in 25 matches but after the restart of the season after the lockdown, Verona conceded 51 goals in all 38 matches that season, which showed that their defensive form had been long lost, which is a shame. The 20-year-old suffered a bicep injury twice during the course of the season, missing a total of eight matches, which does not seem to be a big deal in all honesty.

DAKAR, Senegal (AP) — The son of the former head of world athletics denounced the corruption and money laundering charges against himself and his father on Monday and called their trial in France a "conspiracy" by the "Anglo-Saxons."
 Papa Massata Diack's comments came at a news conference he called in their home country of Senegal two days before a verdict is expected in the trial.
 Diack's father, Lamine Diack, was president of the IAAF, now known as World Athletics, from 1999-2015. Papa Massata Diack worked under his father as a consultant for the athletics body. The two men are charged with corruption, money laundering and breach of trust, and are alleged to have used their positions to enrich themselves to the tune of millions of dollars.
 Prosecutors say Lamine Diack directly or indirectly solicited 3.45 million euros ($3.9 million) in bribes from athletes, many of them Russian, to cover up their positive doping tests. He also used his authority to enable his son, who he employed as a marketing consultant, to siphon off millions of dollars from sponsorship deals, the prosecutors allege.
 On Monday, Papa Massata Diack complained that the trial in June was held without him, yet he had refused to attend the proceedings and Senegal declined to extradite him after an international arrest warrant. The 87-year-old Lamine Diack did attend the trial and testified. His son was tried in his absence. They both denied the charges.
 “I refused to come to the French courts because they lacked impartiality," Papa Massata Diack said at the news conference in Dakar. “To submit to French justice is to put myself at the disposal of my enemies.”

Dundee United defender Ryan Edwards has been backed by former Premier League referee Dermot Gallagher following his challenge on Alfredo Morelos.
 Gallagher does not think Edwards will face retrospective action for his challenge on the Rangers striker, who was stretchered off with a gash near his knee.
 Edwards won the ball but then caught the Colombia international with his follow-through.
 Scottish Football Association compliance officer Clare Whyte has until 3pm on Tuesday to decide whether to issue Edwards with a notice of complaint for the tackle after referee Kevin Clancy played on.
 “I think they’ll say no,” Gallagher told Sky Sports News. “This tackle will split lots and lots of people because many people think it’s a red card and a lot of people think it’s not.
 “I actually don’t because Edwards plays the ball first – he gets the ball first.
 “It’s unfortunate he follows through and catches Morelos across the knee.
 “He hasn’t gone in with a raised boot, he’s followed through and it’s a consequence of his tackle.
 “I think Morelos goes in to win the ball, he gets there slightly after Edwards and I think it’s inevitable there will be a collision and there is a collision and it’s unfortunate. But you can’t judge every challenge on a physical outcome, you have to judge it on the tackle.
 “If someone picks up an injury as a consequence of a challenge it can be accidental and I think this is.”
 A notice of complaint could be raised if the incident is deemed serious foul play of an “exceptional” variety and was not seen in full by Clancy and his fellow match officials.
 An act can be deemed exceptional if the level of force was “very high”; if the challenge was malicious or designed to cause injury; there was a “very high” level of danger; or if the challenge caused a “significant injury”.
 Morelos is a doubt for Rangers’ Europa League second qualifying-round tie against Lincoln Red Imps on Thursday.

One of the city's biggest success stories in recent years is Chiche!, a thriving Middle Eastern restaurant that perhaps best sums up the capital's dynamism and diversity. Syrian head chef Chadi employs cooks from Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia and beyond, allowing chefs from abroad to integrate into Luxembourg life by offering them meaningful work that lets their talent shine. Starting as a pop up in 2015 and now expanded to two full restaurants, it's an extraordinary story from a small but relentlessly enterprising and open-minded city.
 "There's so much opportunity to bring something from your own country that doesn't already exist or to create something new," said Roberts. Not bad for a boring city that's difficult to spot on a map.

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — Andrew Gillum, Florida's Democratic nominee for governor in 2018, told a television interviewer he is bisexual, responding to rumors swirling since March when he was found intoxicated in a hotel room with two men, including one who works as a male escort.
 “I don't identify as gay but I do identify as bisexual,” Gillum told Tamron Hall on her syndicated talk show, which aired Monday. “And that is something that I have never shared publicly before.”
 The former Tallahassee mayor, 41, appeared on the show with his wife, R. Jai. They have three young children. He did not immediately return a call Monday from The Associated Press seeking comment.
 Gillum was an upset winner of the Democratic gubernatorial primary in 2018 and was the first African American to be nominated for the office by the two major parties.
 Gillum was found in a Miami Beach hotel room at 1 a.m. March 13 by paramedics responding to a drug overdose, police said then. Police say Gillum and two other men were in the hotel room.
 They said Gillum and Travis Dyson, 30, were apparently under the influence of an “unknown substance.” Rescuers began chest compressions on Dyson and he was taken to a hospital, where he recovered.

ROSEVILLE, Calif. (KOVR) - Something stinks in a California town, and it has people lining up to see it.“I think I was gonna puke and die,” said one smiling child.It may look like something from the movie “Little Shop of Horrors,” but this 6-foot-7-inch Titan Arum, commonly known as the corpse flower, is real and lives up to its name."It’s actually pollinated by beetles and flies, so it’s trying to attract those insects, " said CJ Attington, a science teacher at Roseville High School. “So it gives off different sulfur compounds that mimic the odor of garbage and rotting flesh.”The plant, which grows naturally in hot and humid Sumatra, needs a little coaxing in this climate. That’s why it’s housed in a greenhouse at the high school.“We’re the only high school in the world that’s ever managed to bloom a corpse flower, so we’re quite proud of that,” Attington said.The science teacher has lovingly cared for it, which they named “Thing 2.”“The fact that it takes this type of maintenance and nine to 10 years to grow means you usually see it only at big facilities with staff and money,” he said.Attington built an audience around its arrival, setting up a webcam and a time-lapse to draw in crowds.“We’ve been on watch for the corpse flower for the last two weeks, so we’ve been watching it online, watching it grow, waiting for this moment for it to bloom,” said Kelley Newstead, a parent.Newstead wasn’t aware it was local until her kids brought it to her attention.“The height of it is absolutely incredible and the smell - yeah, I can’t describe it,” she said. “But it’s something that will stay with me for sure. I will remember that smell.”A truly unusual flower, Attington says its bulb must reach a whopping 35 to 40 pounds to flower. A smell to die for in what has been a year that really, well, stinks.“We’re having kind of an unpleasant time right now, and I think a lot of people are finding that this sort of thing is sort of like a little breath of fresh air,” Attington said.Copyright 2020 KOVR via CNN Newsource.

Louth GAA’s new stadium was given the green light on Thursday evening and it’s “the best news in a long, long time,” according to Louth GAA’s Chairman Peter Fitzpatrick.   Louth GAA was granted full planning permission on their 14,000 capacity stadium located on a 14-acre site on Dundalk's Inner Relief Road, bringing an end to a drawn out saga dating back decades.   The green light is a significant boost to the Wee County who frequently suffered with the limited 3,500 capacity of the O’Raghallaigh club’s Gaelic Grounds in Drogheda. The new county grounds will have a covered seated stand for 4,080 fans, a sheltered terrace for 8,470, and a general standing area for 1,450 more.   “It’s the best news since 1959, in my books. We lost the old Athletic Grounds in 1959 and for the last maybe 50 years we’ve been trying very hard to get a stadium,” explained Fitzpatrick.   “About two years ago we set up a field committee to try and find a new home. I think the people of Louth, they probably lost a wee bit of faith. They probably didn’t believe that it was actually going to ever happen.   “Our six-man committee was appointed by the Louth County Board two years ago to go away and find the right place for Louth to have its own pitch. We did a lot of soul searching from the north to the south of Louth and we identified that this site in Dundalk belonging to the Council was the best that could be got.   “We approached Louth County Council about purchasing the land a couple of years ago. We done the deal with the council, and in fairness, Croke Park gave us the money needed to buy the field which was a great start.” GAA President John Horan made the short trip to Louth for the official turning of the sod on their 14-acre site back in January.   “John Horan came to Dundalk to turn the sod on our new development at the start of the year. Almost 300 or 400 people turned up for the event and I have to be honest with you, it’s probably the nicest day I ever experienced in the GAA,” admitted Fitzpatrick.   The development is expected to take around two years to complete and preliminary works have been ongoing for the last number of months.   “For the last four or five months we’ve already spent over €200,000 on the field. We completed enabling works, which means drains and the likes. We were lucky enough to get 5,000 lorry loads of top soil from local factories. The 14-acre site is completely flat at the moment, which is a major start,” explained the Louth chairman.   “We’d be hoping to start construction in the new year, and we’re going to be working very hard over the next few months to secure the money to build the stadium.”   With a total cost of €12 million, Fitzpatrick says they will be asking the people of Louth to “put their shoulder behind the wheel” to help achieve the goal.   Louth GAA will be hoping to get €4 million from Croke Park and €4 million in the Sports Capital Grant in order to finance the development, as well as raising the remaining €4 million themselves.   “Doing a project like this, spending over €12 million, it tells the people of Louth that we mean business going forward,” Fitzpatrick states.   “You need your own home and you need your own identity. This new stadium means we will finally have a home, a set up to call our own, and a plan for the future,” he concluded.

To test the Billows BBQ Temp Control Fan, the first step was to cover up the air intake holes on our grill. The unit comes with heat-resistant flue tape that works with most standard grills. We happened to test the fan with a Big Green Egg, so we picked up their $6 kamado mounting plate instead. From there, we inserted the Billows into the remaining air vent using the hairpin spring, plugged it into the 12-volt power adapter and the Smoke X base unit, and fired up the grill. After setting the desired temperature on the ambient temperature probe channel, we monitored whether the Billows fan kicked on and off to hold the grill within 10°F to 15°F of the set temperature.

Once we walked over 200 feet from the receiver, or put several buildings in between the two units, the receiver’s readings started to vary. They were within two degrees of the base unit, but they didn’t maintain a 100% sync. As we returned closer to the base unit, the receiver became more accurate, so there must be a slight communications lag with extended distances.

One of the weirdest aspects of the Rendlesham Forest case is the rumor that at the height of the events a local prison was due to be evacuated. A further rumor suggests that aerosol-based hallucinogens were released in the woods as a part of the experiments. It's said that it was the possibility of those same hallucinogens reaching the prison that provoked significant worry. As history has shown, the prison (called HM Hollesley Bay) was _not_ evacuated. That such plans _were_ almost put in place, however, adds yet another drug-based aspect to the overall story. People in Hazmat outfits suddenly appearing on the scene, adds even more intrigue to the story. As I said at the start of this article, there are few UFO cases that have such ties to the domain of drugs. The Rendlesham Forest affair, however, is significantly different. Drugs appear all over the place in the case. Why might that be? The answer is simple: the case was not a UFO event. It was an experiment; a highly- classified one. And it played with minds to a dangerous degree.

"An eye-catching headpiece, both stylish and protective" is in the works, courtesy of Louis Vuitton and meant to help keep COVID-19 at bay, but it won't come cheap. Per the _New York Post_, the fashion house's new plastic face shield, which is part of the brand's 2021 Cruise Collection, will be available for purchase at certain LV stores starting Oct. 30. The rumored price: around $960 (though a Louis Vuitton rep tells Business Insider no price has been decided on yet). CNN notes the visorlike shield--with its elastic monogrammed headband and gold studs with the Louis Vuitton name etched into them--turns darker in sunlight to protect wearers, "like one giant transition lens," per _Forbes_. The shield can also be flipped up to wear like a hat.

Virtual carriers, also known as MVNOs, trade hands in the US regularly. TracFone's collection of brands was by far the largest, followed by Boost, which T-Mobile sold to Dish after the merger and which operates on T-Mobile's network. Virtual carrier Ting also recently sold itself to Dish.
 The remaining independent MVNOs only have a few million subscribers each; they include Consumer Cellular, Republic Wireless, Red Pocket, US Mobile and others mentioned in our feature on cheap wireless plans.
 There's been a lot of concern in the MVNO world after the Sprint/T-Mobile merger, and we may see some of that playing out here. Many virtual carriers relied on Sprint and T-Mobile's low wholesale rates, either using the two carriers as their networks or as competition to keep wholesale rates from the other carriers down. Without Sprint and T-Mobile competing with each other any more, virtual network operators may be looking to get out.

At the moment, amid the COVID pandemic, Broadway won’t return to performances until at least 2021, but across the pond, some producers have announced plans to get musicals up and running as early as this November. Per the BBC, a number of plays have announced plans to return to performances in October — including the long-running _Agatha Christie’s The Mousetrap_ — while musicals are making plans to return in November. Among them, _Everybody’s Talking About Jamie_ and the hit historical pop musical _Six_. The latter only features a six-person cast plus a band onstage, which would make it easier to accommodate various health guidelines, but as the New York _Times_ notes, a recent rise in coronavirus cases in Britain has cast doubt on reopening plans. The show is currently aiming for an 11-week run, starting November 14, with the theater operating at a reduced capacity, and choreography rejiggered so that the wives are not singing directly at each other. Previously, the show’s producer Kenny Wax had announced plans for a drive-in tour of _Six_ this summer, which was later canceled over concerns about COVID hot spots on the planned tour stops.

The book contains everything a Dungeon Master needs to run this famous adventure of gothic horror. Discover the tragic history of Strahd and how his fate is tied to Barovia. From non-player characters to sinister locales and plenty of monsters to occupy them, the book features every element necessary to running a great game. It also includes handouts you can scan and print out for your players and printouts of the Tarokka cards needed for certain parts of the game.
 The most interesting part of this adventure is its open-ended nature and re- playability. Randomized elements in the game and the Dungeon Master’s ability to start the adventure in a variety of ways keeps both new and experienced players on their toes. As it is a horror adventure, you never know what might happen even if you’ve visited the unhallowed halls of Castle Ravenloft before. Death is awaiting within every shadow, and yet is not the worst fate that can befall you in Strahd’s dreaded domain.
 You can check out the book from the Dalton-Whitfield County Public Library curbside service if you are interested in running this campaign. I would like to point out that if you are more interested in playing than Dungeon Mastering, this book is not for you, as it can ruin the surprises for players, so it’s better to talk your Dungeon Master into picking it up.
 If you have a teen who is interested in playing, we will be running “Curse of Strahd” from the library’s Teen Discord Server in October. All new players are welcome to join our weekly game on Tuesdays at 4:30 p.m. Feel free to contact us for more information.

How strange it must feel in these strange times to be a TC3 Panther cross- country runner. While all other fall sports are on hold, the Panthers are gearing up to host their first-ever intercollegiate meet on the Dryden campus. The Tompkins-Cortland Invite will be held this Saturday (September 12th) and it will kick off a busy fall schedule that will see the Panthers compete in seven different meets, all packed very tightly together.
 It says on TC3’s website, “While all teams will be able to practice during the fall semester, cross country, a non-contact sport which can compete in a manner that is in alignment with current safety protocols, will be the lone team competing for Tompkins Cortland this fall.”
 While the team will indeed compete, it will do so in a revised format, and to get some clarification I reached out to Panther runner Robert Brehm. Brehm was one of the two original signees when the program was launched in the Fall of 2019, and when asked if his veteran status made him a team captain of sorts, he told me, “Yes, I am one of the leaders, and Andrew McDaniel (the other original signee) have a split role. He and I will be leading the charge.”
 I asked Robert if the roster numbers have held steady, and he said, “We started last season off with six or seven runners, and we had a couple compete off and on.” He added, “You know… injuries, life…” have
 This season, Brehm says, “We picked up a couple more kids,” and he talked about the preparation involved in gearing up for the first-ever Tompkins- Cortland Invite. “There is a lot of work involved in setting it up, for sure, but it is different preparing as a runner.” Asked why, he stated, “In a normal cross country conference race, all teams are competing at the same time, and you will likely have fifty to sixty runners on the course. . It can be a little tight out there. Now – due to the circumstances and the need for safety and distancing – each team will be going out at a different time and running by itself, so there will only be five to ten runners. There won’t be as much contact.”

The carjacking occurred around 7 p.m., and Dejesus was in custody in about 45 minutes, Kiddy said. Dejesus gave no statement to law enforcement, according to Kiddy.
 Police believe Dejesus used a small-caliber handgun to shoot Malfregeot, Kiddy said.
 Malfregeot's wife and mother-in-law suffered "emotional stress," as well as "some scrapes and bruising just from being removed from the vehicle," Kiddy said.
 Dejesus was on supervised release in a Northern District of West Virginia case that had been transferred to Delaware after his release from prison. The petition to revoke supervised released likely will remain sealed until his initial appearance on it. Kennedy said Dejesus was "in violation for failure to report."
 Earlier this summer, Dejesus was accused of violating his supervised release by not wearing a substance abuse monitoring patch; failing to report for drug testing; failing to follow through with mental health treatment; using marijuana and Adderall; and getting kicked out of a Delaware residential re- entry center.
 He was jailed from July 6 through Aug. 7, then released as the allegation was resolved in Delaware U.S. District Court, according to Northern West Virginia Chief Deputy U.S. Marshal Terry Moore.
 Police are investigating whether Dejesus was under the influence at the time of the alleged carjacking, according to Kiddy.
 If Dejesus is convicted of first-degree robbery, he could effectively face life in prison since there is no upper limit to the sentence.
 Malfregeot has been on council for eight years and served a term as vice mayor. He is well-liked and well-known in the community, having run a restaurant and catering business. He also worked in the natural gas and the funeral industries.
 Malfregeot developed and marketed a popular sauce, J&J Everything Sauce, which still draws rave reviews from locals and others who have sampled it.
 In addition to Clarksburg and Bridgeport police and the Harrison County Sheriff's Office, White Hall Police, State Police, Harrison County EMS and the Clarksburg Fire Department assisted, Kennedy said. He also cited the work of Harrison/Taylor 911 dispatchers.

The Flip's battery life is good, but certainly not elite. Ten and a half hours is, on its own, a pretty good result. You'll get a full day of classes or a commute off of that amount, so it's not a weakness. If you're a true road warrior and spend a _very_ long time off the charger, though, you may want to consider one of the more enduring alternatives. The IdeaPad Flex 5 14 is the only option that is in a different tier of battery life altogether, though, while the others represent a modest improvement.
 ## A Solid All-Rounder for Convertible Fans
 The Asus VivoBook Flip is a good budget convertible with no major weak points. The build is compact and lightweight, it has a healthy selection of ports and a nice screen, and battery life is decent. The performance, in particular, is a strong suit, thanks to the Ryzen 7 chip, which tops the Ryzen 5 and Intel alternatives in machines around the same price.
 That said, those things don’t make it a _great_ budget convertible. The build is solid enough on the exterior, but a little too flexible around the keyboard deck, and the keyboard is so-so. The battery life is merely okay, as well. These are the aspects that remind you this is an inexpensive laptop, but the same doesn't apply to all machines in this tier. Compared to the designs of the Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 5 14 and the HP Envy x360 13 (2020), the Asus is not as impressive. It does get extra points for performance, but at the end of the day, the IdeaPad Flex 5 14 is a superior laptop overall for $100 less and retains its Editors' Choice. Still, if you're concerned with raw CPU performance above all, the VivoBook Flip 14 has plenty of charm inside its shell.

“Gillum’s reflections demonstrate that there must be space in our country for people to be themselves without shame and fear," Johns said in a statement. “When we are forced by harmful societal expectations to operate in black and white, with no room to express the many gray areas of ourselves that make us who we are, we get hurt.”
 Since 2018, Gillum has mounted an effort to register Democratic voters in Florida and frequently appears on cable news channels as a political commentator.
 In 2019, the Florida Commission on Ethics found probable cause that Gillum violated state ethics laws when he accepted gifts during out-of-town excursions with lobbyists and vendors and failed to report them. This included tickets to a performance of the musical “Hamilton.” A settlement of $5,000 was agreed to in that case.

The construction of a road-rail network from Gwadar to Kashgar is an enormous task and financially sound but not impossible. China’s technological expertise, experience, and desire to expand trade and business routes from its western region to the rest of the global market through Gwadar can make this dream a reality without Pakistan having to entirely finance this vision. Pakistan should be on board to provide security to the Chinese and other investors and satisfy their all queries and worries, which should be sincerely addressed at all levels. Similarly, by taking the regional and international powers into confidence for the commercial use of the port, the economic interdependence at the country at the regional and international levels will automatically guarantee security to all actors along with evolving a conducive business environment. The project of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is becoming a new vista for China-Pakistan relations. Both countries can increase cultural, economic, and strategic relations and people-to-people contact, which will bring regional stability and peace.
