Mahendra Chaudhary Zoological Park, popularly known as Chhatbir Zoo, reopened after a gap of nine months on Thursday, welcoming 1,100 visitors on the first day.
 As part of safety protocols against Covid-19, the zoo will be allowing 2,700 visitors per day for now. Before, it was closed on March 16 in view of the pandemic, the zoo saw a daily footfall of nearly 3,000.
 The main attraction on Thursday was white tigress Diya's three cubs - Amar, Arjun and Dilnoor, who were born on November 17 last year. Most of the visitors flocked around their enclosure, enchanted by the two male and one female cubs, who have an orange coat unlike their mother.
 Zoo field director M Sudhagar said, "We are happy with the response on Thursday and are hopeful of more footfall during the weekend."
 He added that they were following the standard operating procedure to ensure the safety of visitors, employees, workers and animals.
 The zoo will remain open from 9.30am to 4.30pm on six days (Monday closed).
 Before it was closed in March, it was earning nearly Rs 1.8 lakh a day, and hence, suffered losses to the tune of Rs 5 crore over the past nine months. Hoping to become self-reliant in the next two years, zoo authorities say it will take at least six months to recover from the losses.
 One of the largest zoos in India, Chhatbir Zoo is spread over 505 acres of forest area in Mohali and is home to around 1,500 animals and birds, including five adult tigers and three cubs.

Visitation was up 20% at Big Bend National Park in October, park officials said, and on Thanksgiving weekend so many cars clogged the park it caused a traffic jam. In the liberal artist outpost of Marfa, young people from Austin and Dallas roam the town, sipping almond milk lattes and photographing murals that ask existential questions like, “Is austerity an illusion?”


  A recent art installation caused a stir with a blatant message against tourism during the pandemic: “Everyone here hates you.”


  But tourism, it turns out, is not the biggest part of the problem.


  The area’s limited contact tracing shows more localized spread — in bars, in multigenerational homes and through people who ignore positive test results and continue to work and socialize as normal.


  In Alpine, the largest city, with a population of 5,900, residents wear masks with their cowboy hats to shop at Porter’s grocery store but take them off to eat indoors at restaurants in town. There is far from universal agreement about whether masks are necessary and effective. In a sign of the dispute that has played out on and off social media, the county was left without a local health authority when the doctor in the position, a pediatrician working on a volunteer basis, quit this fall after facing pushback from residents who opposed mask orders and other restrictions.


  Brewster County, which includes Alpine, has already instructed bars to close and reduced indoor dining at restaurants from 75% capacity to 50%, as required by the governor’s order for counties with a high proportion of COVID-19 hospitalizations. But enforcement is spotty, and the governor has barred local officials from imposing rules that are stricter than his own.


  With resources scarce, local health clinics are a primary option for testing, but even then, the swabs have to be driven three hours to El Paso and flown for processing in Arlington, outside Dallas. The National Guard also offers periodic testing, and in response to the growing crisis, new mobile testing vans were scheduled to arrive this week.


  For those who do get seriously sick, the hospital, Big Bend Regional Medical Center in Alpine, has just 25 beds and a makeshift COVID ward where patients have been sequestered at the end of the lone, L-shaped hallway.


  Dr. John Ray, a family practitioner who works shifts at the hospital, said the hospital on one recent day got back-to-back calls about incoming coronavirus patients. One of them had to be transferred to a bigger hospital in Odessa to receive specialized care.


  Not long afterward, Ray said, he saw the patient’s obituary in the paper.


  “I don’t want to see Alpine like the pictures you see in New York, just people dying in hallways waiting for a bed,” said Ray, 44, who grew up in the small East Texas town of Troup, moved to Wisconsin for his residency and returned to Texas afterward, settling in the Big Bend region in 2013 for the beauty and the people.


  He and his wife, also a doctor, usually treat a caseload of strep throat, urinary tract infections and pregnancy visits. Now, he said, “it’s COVID, COVID, COVID.”

Recently, he had clashed with public health officials in California over measures put in place to slow the spread of the coronavirus, which included shutting down production at Tesla’s factory in Fremont, a city in the San Francisco Bay Area. He called restrictions to stop the spread of the virus “fascist” and predicted incorrectly in March that there would be almost no new cases in the country by the end of April.


  Texas, by contrast, has imposed limited restrictions on businesses during the pandemic, even as new infections soar.


  Musk said Tuesday that he had moved to be near a new factory Tesla is building outside Austin. SpaceX also has a launch site near South Padre Island on the Gulf of Mexico.


  Speaking at a conference hosted by The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday, he said California had become less accommodating to successful entrepreneurs and startups, comparing the state to a sports team that takes winning for granted. “They do tend to get a little complacent, a little entitled, and then they don’t win the championship anymore,” he said.


  Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas greeted the news with the enthusiasm of a state that revels in turning non-natives into converts who share a familiar saying: “I wasn’t born in Texas, but I got here as fast as I could.”


  “Welcome to Texas! @elonmusk,” Cruz, a Republican, tweeted. “Texas loves jobs & we’re very glad to have you as a Texan.”


  California leaders, on the other hand, have treated Musk’s vows to leave mostly with indifference.


  Confident in their state’s natural beauty and status as the vanguard for culture and technology, Californians have largely shrugged even as the state’s population growth has dipped in recent years to the slowest it has been in more than a century, as a result of decreasing immigration and a growing exodus to other states.


  “You will know that California has truly crossed a line when home prices start falling,” said Christopher Thornberg, founding partner of Beacon Economics, a consulting firm in Los Angeles. As it is, he said, “there is more demand to live in California than to not live in California.”


  Even Musk, he surmised, will likely spend significant time in California, taking advantage of all the pleasures the Golden State has to offer the uber- wealthy.


  Thornberg said he believed that California had made policy mistakes in responding to the pandemic that might negatively affect the state’s business climate. But, he added, remote workers who have the option to leave “are sure as hell not moving to Texas.”


  Critics say the growth in Texas has been propelled by the use of millions of dollars in tax breaks and incentives, an opaque, poorly regulated practice that has come under increasing scrutiny in the wake of the huge, public search by Seattle-based Amazon for a place to build a second headquarters. (Cities in the Dallas area competed fiercely, offering billions in incentives, while some in Los Angeles were actually relieved when the city was out of the running.)


  The political climate, while a draw for some conservatives, has also proved tricky.


  Texas lawmakers and business leaders have clashed over socially conservative measures, such as a failed “bathroom bill” that would have required transgender people to use the bathrooms that correspond with the sex on their birth certificate in public buildings and schools.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Wall Street has rolled out the welcome mat for companies going public this year, boosting proceeds from initial public offerings to the highest level in six years.
 IPOs slowed sharply in the spring due to the pandemic, but they surged in the summer as the market recovered from a steep slump and rallied to new highs. And so far, betting on IPOs has paid off.
 Companies that have gone public this year have averaged a return of 53.8% above their IPO price, including a return of 23.4% after their first day of trading, according to Renaissance Capital, an IPO research provider.
 In the 10 years prior, however, the average return after the first day of trading was 3.2%, a track record that includes some flops and is why many analysts caution investors not to follow an IPO just because of the hype.
 Household names like DoorDash and Airbnb are the latest IPOs to whet investors' appetite for solid returns. DoorDash shares surged nearly 86% above their offering price of $102 in their market debut Wednesday. Ahead of the IPO, the delivery service projected it would raise $3.37 billion in the offering. That edges out Snowflake for the biggest IPO so far this year, according to Renaissance Capital.
 "This year had a lot of large IPOs," said Matthew Kennedy, senior IPO market strategist at Renaissance Capital. "And its had the most billion-dollar IPOs ever."
 This year is projected to finish with 210 IPOs raising about $80 billion combined, Kennedy said. That would be up from 160 IPOs and $46 billion in proceeds last year, and the highest level since 2014.
 The backdrop for companies going public this year has been more than welcoming. The Federal Reserve has kept interest rates near zero since this spring in a bid to support the economy through its pandemic-driven recession. That helped pave the way for stocks to climb to new highs and gave companies confidence to go public.
 Airbnb put off a market debut in the spring when the pandemic crippled global travel. The San Francisco company priced its shares at $68 apiece late Wednesday, giving it an overall value of $47 billion. Shares begin trading Thursday.
 Some 18 company IPOs have brought in over a billion dollars, including DoorDash. Four others, including Airbnb, are also expected to cross the billion-dollar threshold.
 Still, individual investors may want to consider waiting a few days after a company has its IPO, if not longer.
 Consider that about half of U.S.-based companies that went public from 2015 to 2019, including Uber Technologies, Fitbit and Blue Apron, were trading below their IPO prices a year later. It took Facebook 15 months to trade above its IPO price.
 "Looking back at history, it's pretty much been a coin toss as to how these stocks perform a year after they go public," said Lindsey Bell, chief investment strategist at Ally Invest.
 Investors need to make sure they are buying into an IPO because they believe in the company's prospects for earnings growth and avoid being swept away by the hype that tends to form around big-name stocks.
 Another consideration is whether a company has proven it can make a profit. Uber, which raised $8.1 billion in its market debut last year, has yet to get out of the red.
 "I wouldn't count out an IPO that was losing money, but I would want to make sure that company has a solid plan to get to profitability within a couple of years or whenever you feel comfortable," Bell said.
 And while it may be tempting to buy stocks of companies whose products or services we see or use often, that's also not a sound approach. "Investing in what you know" doesn't mean buying DoorDash because you order food every other day. It means knowing whether DoorDash will get enough customers at high- enough prices to remain profitable, and at what level.
 One way for investors to get a slice of a hot IPO prospect is to wait beyond the company's market debut until the stock makes its way into index funds, which own baskets of many stocks and generally come with low fees.
 The Renaissance IPO ETF, which tracks an index that holds companies that have had an IPO within the last two years, giving more weight to bigger ones, is up 108% this year. The S&P; 500 is up about 14%.
 "Trading on an IPO day tends to be full of emotion, and most investors should steer clear of emotional investing," said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird. "Allow some time to pass and get a sense of what's going on with a stock or with a company."

The total, it turned out, was an average of about 1,000 calories a week of compensatory eating, no matter how much people had worked out. By that math, the men and women who had burned 1,500 calories a week with exercise had clawed back all but about 500 calories a week of their expenditures, while those burning through 3,000 calories with exercise ended up with a net weekly deficit of about 2,000 calories. (No one’s overall metabolic rate changed much.)


  Unsurprisingly, the group exercising the most lost weight; the others did not.


  But that study left many questions unanswered, Flack felt. The participants had performed similar, supervised workouts, walking moderately for 30 or 60 minutes, five times a week. Would varying lengths or frequencies of workouts matter to people’s caloric compensation? And what was driving people’s eating? Did the differing amounts of exercise affect people’s appetite hormones differently?


  To find out, he and his colleagues decided to repeat much of the earlier experiment, but with novel exercise schedules this time. So, for the new study, which was published in November in Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise, they gathered another group of 44 sedentary, overweight men and women, checked their body compositions, and asked half of them to start exercising twice a week, for at least 90 minutes, until they had burned about 750 calories a session, or 1,500 for the week. They could work out however they wished — many chose to walk, but some chose other activities — and they wore a heart rate monitor to track their efforts.


  The rest of the volunteers began exercising six times a week for about 40 to 60 minutes, burning close to 500 calories a session, for a weekly total of about 3,000 a week. The researchers also drew blood, to check on the levels of certain hormones that can affect people’s appetites.


  After 12 weeks, everyone returned to the lab, where the researchers refigured body compositions, repeated the blood draws and began calculating compensations.

The clouds of COVID-19 have cast a gray veil over all aspects of life as we know it. Days spill into weeks and right on into months which all seem to have blurred the grains of time together into an endless loop of a universal “Groundhog Day” feeling — a humdrum, almost monotonous emotional state that appears to be amplified during the holiday season. The end-of-year holidays mark the entrance of the door that begins the closing of another, a year that has been starkly different from all before it and one that I believe most of us wish would end instead of trailing behind us as we begin to approach a new year.
 With the stress and uncertainty of the pandemic continually evolving, it may be difficult to squint at the clouds of the pandemic for silver linings. But there is no better time than now to remember one of life’s simple truths: The best things in life aren’t “things.” The holiday season encourages the practice of giving and appreciation which can be easier said than done during a pandemic that has taken the very things that some of us may have been thankful for just the year before. So while the warm and fuzzy feelings ignited around the fireplace of my celebratory mood can feel lessened, I find gratitude in all that still remain — and if there is any time for giving and appreciation, there is no better time than now.
 This year, this moment — as we go about our new routines — we should count our blessings as one would the stars, as the smallest parts of our lives we may overlook can be the bigger pieces lost from the lives of others. This holds for the simplicities in life that we often take for granted such as the air we breathe, the sun that shines in our eyes to those who make you feel at home wherever you are and our loved ones who stuck by our sides as we watched the world outside of our own crumble and unfold.

Still, as "Let Them All Talk" (a bland title) chugs along, it becomes increasingly involving, and then doesn't really deliver a particularly Hollywood-style ending. Soderbergh also elicits wonderfully natural performances from his leads -- constructed with extensive improvisation -- starting with Barbara's resistance to grabbing tea or coffee with Alice, fueling speculation about the lingering grudge that drove them apart.
 In interviews, the principals have noted that the movie was shot on a relative shoestring, over a few weeks as the ship made its passage. The fact that most reasonable people would rather watch a cruise right now than actually risk booking one is either something of an added bonus or a distraction, take your pick.
 For Streep -- who also teamed with Soderbergh on last year's "The Laundromat" \-- the juxtaposition of this streaming movie and another a day part, Netflix's "The Prom," offers a reminder of both her range, and why she remains in such high demand. Here, she's restrained to the point of clenched; there, she's a loud, narcissistic actor in the latter, belting out show tunes.
