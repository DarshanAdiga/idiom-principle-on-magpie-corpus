Let’s consider our national forests. Should we anticipate these fuel loads becoming even worse than they are? Yes. Are larger, more deadly fires predictable if no changes are made? Yes. Why is this happening, and who is to blame? The United States Forest Service controls 166,819,068 acres of forestland in the American West. Clearcutting practices and high-extraction mandates were prevalent in the 1950s, 60s, 70s, and 80s, and this converted a large portion of these acres out of “natural forests” and into “managed forests.”
 These managed forests were seeded and planted with commercial value in mind. They were knowingly over-stocked with the intention of doing stand-enhancing, pre-commercial thinning at the appropriate time. Managed stands at different stages of maturity are interwoven with unmanaged stands of old growth. This mixed forest contributed huge socio-economic benefits to the citizenry, and wildfire starts were suppressed immediately and aggressively.
 Over time, an evolving sequence of environmental laws and regulations metastasized into a drastic change pertaining to the agency’s management model. This change was driven by new listings of “threatened and endangered species” like the spotted-owl, and that listing precipitated legislation called the Northwest Forest Plan.The Forest Service went from “timber- management” to “habitat management” overnight. Eighty percent of the Umpqua became reserves to protect old-growth (LSR’s). This was accompanied by a sweeping cultural change within the agency and as well as an incredible empowerment of the environmental NGO’s who became overseers and enforcers of the new model.
 Nearly all management activities in our National Forests ceased, including commercial timber extraction (which provided funding for counties and the agency), pre-commercial thinning (which was preplanned and imperative to forest health), and nearly all road maintenance (which sacrificed untold infrastructure investment). Wildfires became the only viable opportunity to reduce exploding fuel-loads and many fire-starts were allowed to spread and grow. Nearly all other management efforts have been defeated through lawsuits paid for by the U.S. tax-payer, courtesy of “The Equal Access to Justice” law and the environmental groups that employ it.
 Fast forward to 2020 and an inevitable, predictable, unprecedented event occurs. It was called The Archie Creek Fire in our neck of the woods, and similar landscapes throughout the west are exploding in flames and communities are evacuating.
 This brings us back to climate change and ever-increasing fuel loads. How can we reverse this horrible trend? Unless we can force China, India, and Russia to take immediate extreme actions to reduce their outputs of greenhouse gases, mankind will continue to make significant contributions to climate change. We can destroy our economy with a “Green New Deal,” but our planet’s climate response will be miniscule.
 Climate-change is happening. Period. That leaves one potential solution, which is a new management model that recognizes that large high-severity wildfires are more damaging to habitat (and humans) than fuel-reduction through widespread commercial thinning and roadside fuel breaks. Unfortunately, there is a well-funded group of pseudo-environmentalists who have weaponized climate change as part of a comprehensive effort to “fundamentally change America,” and they are preventing our one solution.

At any given time between 1765 through 1836, the True Blue Estate contained between 96 and 124 enslaved individuals.

Bryant told Bud Wilkinson of Oklahoma in 1951, after he had won the SEC championship in football and Adolph Rupp had won another NCAA basketball title: “The other night we had a joint football-basketball banquet and Rupp was presented with a big four-door Cadillac. All I got was a cigarette lighter.”
 None of that dissuaded Erk, who loved competition across the board. He was especially anxious to make a legal wager. He enjoyed outings at the dog tracks in Jacksonville, which were in reasonable proximity to his second home at Fernandina Beach.
 One year in the late '60s for a night game in Lexington, which was the way it was for years with Georgia and Kentucky playing under the lights so as not to compete with the afternoon races at Keeneland, a group of us was headed to the horse track about noon.
 Erk handed over a couple of dollars to Furman Bisher, sports columnist for the Atlanta Journal, and asked Furman to bet the daily double for him. With that, he took the number “six” from Steve Greer’s jersey, No. 60 and a “five” from Harold Tarrer’s No. 55 for the two horses for his wager. Erk had the right hunch when choosing the players’ numbers for his bet. He won the daily double.
 On the plane home, Erk slipped his winnings to the players, which might have broken a rule, but made the players’ day, which made the defensive coordinator’s day. Erk was always about the players.

The government spent a record US$85.6 billion on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program in the fiscal year ending in September. This sum, included in an October Treasury Department report, was about 35% higher than the $63.5 billion the federal government spent in 2019.
 Spending on this state-administered program, which helps struggling families put food on the table, typically rises and falls in tandem with unemployment and poverty. Along with unemployment insurance, SNAP is one of the most responsive programs in a recession. The most vulnerable families can get benefits within seven days of applying.
 Before the coronavirus pandemic, SNAP spending had been steadily declining since a 2013 peak of nearly $80 billion following the Great Recession. But as the COVID-19-triggered economic crisis hit, monthly spending more than doubled, from $4.9 billion in February to $10.6 billion in June, according to Treasury Department data.

I am voting for Alek Skarlatos for Congress because, for the past four years, we have watched the Democrats cause so much trouble, delay legislation and launch attack after attack against President Donald Trump rather than do their job.
 Two examples: 1. The Mueller investigation lasted more than two years ($40 million spent) and found nothing resembling "Russian collusion" from the Trump campaign. 2. The impeachment — for a phone call — that also came to nothing.
 I do not care to see the debacle of the last 3.5 years repeated, and I believe it is time to clean house. I'm sick of the professional politicians and want to see new blood in Congress. I believe young people with common sense would serve us better than career politicians. When our nation began, it was meant to be a citizen government. Congressman was never meant to be a permanent career.
 I'm rooting for many young, vibrant candidates who are running in races all over our country. I've sent a bit of financial support where I could, even though I can't vote for them. One I CAN vote for is Skarlatos. He has been financially supported by people like me, unlike the huge PACs that support his opponent. Peter DeFazio's 30-plus years in Congress is long enough.

These past few years, I have attended many Harding Township Committee meetings, and I have been incredibly disappointed in the myopic thought process of the committee.


  They preach keeping taxes low - although they have gone up recently for the vast majority of Harding residents - but they seldom spend much time on other pressing issues that affect the future of our community.


  Even if taxes are low to the current residents relative to state averages, they are missing the bigger picture that Harding is not affordable for people like me who want to move back home.


  Affordable housing requirements have been determined by the courts and yet the Township Committee has kicked the can down the road. I believe they should be proactively planning for this. Being thoughtful about long-term planning will allow us to continue to shape our community as we prefer, while we also offer affordable housing for people who need it and in areas deemed suitable.


  Kate and Amanda understand the importance of being proactive and how essential thoughtful planning is for preserving Harding’s character, and also allowing for space for people like myself. It's no secret that we as a town are reliant on volunteerism as the lifeblood of our community and keeping taxes notoriously low.


  This works until there are no more young people able to settle in the town to take up the mantle of our volunteer organizations. I’ve seen this at events such as the Fire Department Auction fundraiser.

Miles Taylor, a former chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security says in a tweet: “Donald Trump is a man without character. It’s why I wrote ‘A Warning’ ... and it’s why me & my colleagues have spoken out against him (in our own names) for months. It’s time for everyone to step out of the shadows.”
 Taylor has been an outspoken critic of Trump’s in recent months, and he has a contributor contract on CNN.
 Taylor’s anonymous essay was published in 2018 by The New York Times, infuriating the president and setting off a frantic White House leak investigation to try to unmask the author.
 In the essay, the person, who identified themselves only as a senior administration official, said they were part of a secret “resistance” force out to counter Trump’s “misguided impulses” and undermine parts of his agenda.
 The author wrote, “Many Trump appointees have vowed to do what we can to preserve our democratic institutions while thwarting Mr. Trump’s more misguided impulses until he is out of office.”
 The allegations incensed the president, bolstering his allegations about a “deep state” operating within his government and conspiring against him. And it set off a Beltway guessing game that seeped into the White House, with current and former staffers trading calls and texts, trying to figure out who could have written the piece.
 Trump, who had long complained about leaks in the White House, also ordered aides to unmask the writer, citing “national security” concerns to justify a possible Justice Department investigation. And he issued an extraordinary demand that the newspaper reveal the author.
 Instead, the author pressed forward, penning a follow-up book published last November called “A Warning” that continued to paint a disturbing picture of the president, describing him as volatile, incompetent and unfit to be commander in chief.
 Trump “stumbles, slurs, gets confused, is easily irritated, and has trouble synthesizing information,” the author alleged, also citing racist and misogynist statements the author claimed Trump made behind closed doors.
 Then-White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham slammed the author as a “coward” for hiding their identity, charging that they “didn’t put their name on it because it is nothing but lies.”

 # Mayor Mike Duggan says he won't leave Detroit for D.C. in 2021 — no matter what
 M.L. Elrick
 Detroit Free Press
 View Comments
 Mayor Mike Duggan, a long-time ally of Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, said Wednesday there is no way he will leave Detroit in 2021 or 2022 or, well, you get the picture.
 There is virtually no chance Duggan would get a job offer if President Donald Trump, a Republican, is re-elected on Tuesday. But there has been speculation that if Biden wins, Duggan, a Democrat whose term expires in 2021, has the political ties and administrative talent to be recruited for his administration.
 "There is no circumstance under which I'm going to Washington, D.C., in 2021," Duggan said in response to a reporter's question about whether he would be around next year to fight the feds if he believes the 2020 U.S. Census count missed many Detroiters. Duggan held a news conference at Detroit Public Safety Headquarters to express his concerns that the Census may have missed large numbers of Detroiters.
 The nationwide effort to count everyone in America is conducted every 10 years and helps determine how $1.5 trillion in federal money will be spread throughout the country. Duggan has stressed the need to count every Detroiter because the more people you have in your city, the more federal money you get.
 The mayor, joined by U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Detroit, said he didn't know yet whether Detroit would challenge the feds' count, which won't be known for more than a month.
 "I would have never left the medical center to go to Washington," said Duggan, who stepped down as CEO of the Detroit Medical Center about 10 years ago as he prepared to run for mayor. "I love the city of Detroit. I came here to do what I'm doing, to work for the people of the city of Detroit. I am not going to Washington."
 Duggan is expected to seek a third term in 2021, but he said he would discuss his future plans in, well, the future.

The Electoral College ensures that small states like Wyoming or Vermont have a voice. Every state and the District of Columbia have at least 3 electoral votes. The number of electors for each state is determined by the number of federal elected officials. Each state has two U.S. Senators and a certain number of Congressmen whose number is based on the population determined by the national census. The total number of electoral votes is 538; it takes 270 to win. If no candidate wins a majority, the decision then goes to the House of Representatives with a vote of state-by-state, with each state having one vote. These directives are in Article II, Section 1 of our Constitution.
 How are electors chosen? Each state sets the laws and chooses the process for selecting their electors. Electors are nominated and voted on by others within a specific party. They are pledged to support a candidate, if that candidate wins the popular vote in the state. Thus Republicans, Democrats, Socialists, Independents, Greens, Libertarians, Communists, etc., may select electors if they have a candidate on the ballot.

Stadtluft macht frei (“city air makes you free”) is a German phrase dating back to the Middle Ages. Legally, it described a rule that if a serf lived in a city for a year and a day, his feudal master could no longer claim him. But the phrase came to mean more than simply a way of escaping feudal bondage. Cities have long been where the poor and the enterprising go to find opportunity and prosperity, to sculpt their lives amid the economic dynamism that conservatives are supposed to celebrate. Cities are where most immigrants go to pursue the American dream. And it’s not just immigrants from other countries. A good rule of thumb for determining whether a state is trending “red” or “blue” is to look at whether young people are moving in or out.

  FAYETTEVILLE - Northside was determined to win its second straight opening- round match at the 6A state volleyball tournament.


  However, Rogers - which lost to the Lady Bears last season at state - made sure a repeat wasn't in the offing.


  Rogers survived a hard-fought opening set and took control midway through the second set. Rogers went on to end the Lady Bears' season with a three-set win, 26-24, 25-18, 25-13, at Fayetteville High School on Tuesday afternoon.


  Last season, Northside won its opening-round match at state against Rogers, with the Lady Bears pulling out a five-set triumph.


  It appeared to continue to be tight in Tuesday's rematch.


  Down 5-1 early, Northside fought back to tie it at 10-all; then went up 12-11 after a kill from Alyssa Brown.


  The Lady Bears then surged ahead, 16-12, and later 18-13, on an ace from Tori Sumbler.


  Rogers came right back to even it at 21-all. Then the two teams traded the lead, and the score was even again at 23-all.


  After Rogers broke the tie on the ensuing point, Brown's kill forced another tie score, this time 24-all. But Rogers got a kill and then the Lady Bears made a hitting error which ended the opening set.


  Both teams continued to go back and forth in the second set. A kill from sophomore Za'Kari Gurule' enabled Northside to tie it at 11-all.


  However, Rogers proceeded to score six of the next seven points to establish some momentum.


  The Lady Bears closed to within four, 21-17, on a kill from junior Dynasty Andrews, but Rogers reeled off the next three points to eventually seize control with a 2-0 lead in the match.


  After the score was tied at 5-all to start the third set, Rogers went on another big run, starting with a 9-1 run and also forged an 18-9 advantage.


  The Lady Bears (11-11) played an entire roster of underclassmen on the court Tuesday.

 "Having a mask on and staying socially distanced, he want to come out and take a picture with the trophy, which can't state strongly enough how big of a role he's played in the success of this organization," Friedman said.
 "But I think for him, just being a free agent, not knowing exactly how the future is going to play out. I don't think there was anyone that was going to stop him from going out," he said. "I think from at least my perspective and not watching it super closely with everything going on, but I think he was mindful of other people, especially other people that he hadn't already been in contact with. This is something that we're going to wrap our arms around tonight and in the morning and figure out where we're going from here."
 Turner, however, was visible on the field without a mask during the celebration. And Dodgers manager Dave Roberts was nearby, also not wearing a mask.
 "I haven't seen the pictures," Friedman said. "If there are people around them without masks, that's not good optics at all. I haven't seen them, so it's hard for me to speak to it specifically."
 "But I think from our standpoint, I think the people who were around him were people that would be in the contact tracing web, anyway, with just how closely a lot of us have been around each other," he said. "And so now I think the subsequent tests we're going to take are really important to figure out what we do and to make sure that any of us that are potentially positive do not spread it to other people."

As is often the case, we can only surmise where the enslaved lived on the estate, since only one structure is shown on historic maps. Typically, enslaved housing would be in marginal, less fertile areas, and this would be true of where their deceased were interred. The plantation owners sometimes buried their dead in small family plots near the house, but more often, they were interred in large cemeteries in churchyards and near larger towns. Thus, given the paucity of artefacts amongst the graves and their location on marginal land (far from the central plantation), there is a high probability the present burials were enslaved individuals from the True Blue Estate.

This year, the world has been affected by the COVID-19 virus. Our biggest fear was that we would have a day when so many of our personnel were ill that we would not be able to provide the service we strive to provide. Early in the pandemic, we developed policies and procedures to reduce the risk to our first responders. These are tedious and time consuming, yet our firefighters have adhered to them, day in and day out. At the time of this writing, only six of our firefighters have become ill. Fortunately, they have experienced mild to moderate symptoms and are already back serving our community.


  Thirty-five years have flown by in the blink of an eye. As the deputy chief of operations, I take great pride in knowing that we have one of the best all- hazard departments in the country. Your Kern County firefighters are ready, both physically and mentally, to mitigate any emergency incident.


  I am often thanked for my service. While thankful when this happens, I am always humbled and slightly embarrassed. Our families are who have earned the real thanks. They “loan” their loved ones to protect and serve for sometimes a month straight. So next time you meet a child or significant other of a firefighter, please take a second to tell them “thank you for your service!”

Earlier this month, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper announced a plan to equip the U.S. Navy with the ships we need to stay competitive with China and other adversaries. As a longtime advocate for a bigger Navy, I was delighted with the goals he outlined. His proposal calls for 500 manned and unmanned ships by the year 2045. This goal builds on the progress we have made since Congress passed my legislation in 2017 requiring 355 ships as soon as practicable. The Navy’s newest ships will carry improved missile and sensor technology, cost less to build and maintain, and require fewer sailors to operate.
 Most encouragingly, Secretary Esper began a department-wide effort to find savings to put toward these ships. He is asking Congress for as much as an 18 percent boost to the Navy’s shipbuilding budget. This would bring spending on ships to a level not seen since President Ronald Reagan. I wholeheartedly welcome this funding goal, but the details of how the money is spent will be critical. I look forward to working with the Navy to ensure we purchase the right combination of ships, including those built in Mississippi.
 Military Should Invest in Proven Technologies
 Our future fleet needs to rely on proven technology. New unmanned ships show great promise, but they have a long way to go before they are battle-ready. A shift to these new technologies too quickly could result in production delays and higher costs. They should be integrated carefully and gradually and should not displace the tried and true core of our naval fleet.
 Mississippi shipbuilders have led the nation in building these ships, which include guided missile destroyers and amphibious warships. I am working to ensure these vessels remain a core priority in future Navy purchases.
 With a larger fleet, the Navy will also need expanded maintenance capacities. The Navy already faces significant maintenance delays, which pose a danger to sailors and result in fewer ships being deployed. Because of delays, the Navy requires a minimum of 11 aircraft carriers to keep just three carriers active at all times. I hope the Navy considers options to reduce the maintenance backlog, such as bundling ship maintenance contracts and working with industry to establish clear expectations for work.
 Strengthening Our Industrial Base
 To reach the Secretary’s 500-ship goal, we will also need a strong and stable industrial base. I have worked for years to deliver more resources to our shipyards, but there is more progress to be made. The Department of Defense and Congress need to give shipbuilders earlier notice on contracts and guarantee production rates for major classes of ships, such as destroyers and aircraft carriers. Military leaders should make more use of block buys to purchase several ships at a time. These changes would allow shipyards to save money, reduce the time it takes to build ships, and keep more workers on the payroll.
 Although we are now entering an economic recovery, COVID-19 continues to have a disruptive effect on businesses – including defense manufacturers. These businesses face production delays and financial uncertainty, threatening our economy as well as our national security. I have proposed new relief to help these manufacturers retain their workforce, which I hope the Senate will pass as part of a larger relief package. We cannot overlook this vital sector of our economy as we work toward a nationwide recovery.

The Indians were a defensive juggernaut that season, outscoring their opponents 247-26 and posting eight shutouts. They were not scored on during the final 21 quarters of the season, keeping their three playoff opponents out of the end zone.
 Roseburg defeated No. 6 Grants Pass 21-0 in the quarterfinals and eliminated Jesuit 19-0 in the semifinals.
 “That season and the following season (1962) was the most fun I ever had playing football,” said Doug John, a tackle/defensive tackle on the state championship team who went on to play at Oregon State University.
 “What made it special was Roy Thompson. He was a special coach, he made the whole team his family. Everybody liked him and he was a father figure to all of us.”
 John, 75, retired in 2017 after owning Roseburg Disposal for over 40 years.
 Thompson, who compiled a 44-15-1 record in six years as the Tribe’s head coach (1958-63), was assisted that season by Joe Schaffeld, Stew Robertson and Pete Hopkins.
 “Roy had some way of communicating with us,” John said. “He didn’t do a lot of yelling. If he had something to say, he didn’t scream in your face.”
 “Aside from my father, I idolized Roy Thompson more than any other male in my life,” said Paul Brothers, an all-state quarterback and starting safety on the 1961 team. “He never let us get away with nothing.”
 Thompson also coached at Astoria (1952-57), Sprague (1975-78) and McKay (1982-85), compiling a career record of 102-82-1.
 Thompson died on Feb. 20, 1993, in Walla Walla, Washington, following a bout with cancer. He was 66.
 The Indians entered the 1961 season with high expectations after finishing 7-2 the previous year.
 “There was a tight family relationship in the whole team,” Kenny King, a linebacker on the title team, told The News-Review in 1986. King passed away on Sept. 2, 2018, at 74.

That’s it, I’m running away!
 As 2020 continues to drag us along to what promises to be a historic end to a less than stellar year, I wonder how many people out there want to just get out and run away. I’ve certainly thought about it, which is a reaction I usually have to difficult, stressful, sometimes painful situations, like gathering a year's worth of financial tax documents, cleaning out the shed, expensive home maintenance, carrying concerns about work, school, affordable insurance and how to make ends meet during uncertain times — oh, and running out of ammo.
 It used to be that the term “runaway” was just that, literally running away. Seems we run away from stuff all the time. There are runaway trains, runaway brides, contestants on Jeopardy that accumulate enough money to run away from the competition, runaway elections (any bets on that come November?), people who run away to sea, couples who run away from home and elope, those who run away to join the military, runaway sporting events, running away from the law, running away from abusive relationships, kids who run away from home, heck, even in fairytales the fork ran away with the spoon! Then there are those of us who just need to “get away from it all” and go on a “walkabout,” which in my case usually involves going fishing or tramping around in the mountains.

Turner, after it was known that he tested positive, rejoined his teammates and joined in the celebration. He held the World Series trophy, was in close contact with teammates and was in the front of the Dodgers' World Series photo.


  MLB said it tried to stop Turner from joining the celebration and asked him to leave after he was on the field, but he "emphatically refused to comply."


  ## 4\. Will MLB punish him?


  It's unclear what MLB will do at this point, but the league has launched an investigation. Asking the question of whether Turner will receive a fine, suspension or another form of discipline is fair. If the league officials, security and health professionals told Turner he needed to stay isolated, and he disobeyed those rules, it's a clear violation of the league's determined safety protocols. On top of it, the Dodgers organization could also be in hot water here.

 The opposite approach has been taken by Sweden. Except for closing tertiary education institutions for a few weeks in the spring and limiting gatherings to 50 for an extended period, its government didn’t impose any economic restrictions. It did exhort people to cover their faces, keep distanced, and restrict interactions with the elderly.

 “It was right after one of our labs here at ULM; I got the call that I was a match,” said Roan, now a senior in MLS.
 He and his parents drove to Houston for the procedure. He hasn’t met the recipient of his bone marrow donation but thinks about her almost every day.
 “They said my first update on her would be about nine months after the procedure. After a year we can trade information with each other. I would love to meet her,” Roan said.

She theorized that there were carriers within the herds, likely ewes, that were infecting their own lambs, and then those lambs would pass the illness to other lambs through play. If they could test the herds and remove the carriers, perhaps they could stop the spread.


  She likened it to New York health authorities identifying a cook named Mary Mallon, better known as Typhoid Mary, as a carrier of typhoid in the early 1900s. Mallon was quarantined as part of an effort to halt the spread of the illness.


  Wildlife officials from Idaho, Oregon and Washington, who work collaboratively to manage sheep, tried the same thing, starting with the Asotin herd that lives along Asotin Creek. It worked, so they expanded to other herds.


  “We had some different approaches in different populations, but in general we tested and we defined a carrier as an animal that was positive over two years on two tests,” Cassirer said.


  Those that met the definition were removed.


  “We just kept testing, and everywhere,” she said. “Except for one population, even though we had animals testing positive, when we came back the next year, they weren’t positive anymore. So there weren’t any carriers, and eventually we weren’t finding any positives at all.”


  Finally, some of the herds are showing signs of growth, with more and more lambs surviving.


  “People going up the river have been telling me they are seeing a lot more sheep and a lot more lambs,” she said. “I think there is a big enough difference for people to detect casually.”


  Cassirer said preparations are underway to expand the testing and removal strategy to herds along the Salmon River above Riggins. At the same time, wildlife managers are working diligently to prevent the disease from being reintroduced to the Hells Canyon herds. That could happen from domestic animals or from infected wild sheep, such as those from the Wallowa Herd, visiting other herds.


  “We are really concerned about that and it getting back into the rest of the sheep,” she said. “That is a really high priority.”


  The three states have developed an outreach program in which they contact owners of domestic sheep and goat herds near occupied bighorn habitat. They offer to test the domestic herds so the owners know if their animals carry the disease.


  “If they do have sheep or goats test positive, we talk to them about what options they might have to clear it from their herds, and if they don’t have it, that is good to know too.”
