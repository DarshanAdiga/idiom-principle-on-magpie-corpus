Emlyn Samuel, head of policy for leading cancer charity Cancer Research UK, told the ECHO that the government's decision to pause many cancer trials at the peak of the pandemic has meant thousands of patients are likely to have missed out on experimental treatments.
 Mr Samuel said the charity is working with the government to ensure the trials get back up and running as soon as possible and will be protected from "further waves of Covid-19".
 He added: “The major disruption to cancer care caused by the pandemic has added additional stress and anxiety to many cancer patients’ experience.
 "It’s completely understandable that people look to any means when they are in extremely difficult situations and, concerningly, we’re starting to hear more stories of patients resorting to paying for cancer treatment.
 "But even before the pandemic cancer services were stretched. The upcoming spending review is the ideal opportunity for the government to show its commitment to the NHS and invest in staff and equipment to give cancer patients the best chance of surviving their disease."

Once our protagonists enter the statue, they climb 20 feet down into Titus' chamber. I designed the chamber as if it had been carved out of stone as a bridge between the beautiful man-made architecture of the museum and the organic earth tunnels. Much of my inspiration for the tunnels came from the Sudwala caves in South Africa, which are over 240 million years old and have a very warm palette. Creating the tunnels and figuring out how to submerge them into a large water tank was a great technical challenge, and the entire art department rose to the occasion. We submerged a sample of the painted walls in water for a month to make sure it wouldn't peel and create debris. The water in the tank needed to be crystal clear so that the camera could shoot from above and below.

Federal health officials say about half of the nation’s daily testing capacity now consists of rapid tests.
 Large hospitals and laboratories electronically feed their results to state health departments, but there is no standardized way to report the rapid tests that are often done elsewhere. And state officials have often been unable to track where these tests are being shipped and whether results are being reported.
 In Minnesota, officials created a special team to try and get more testing data from nursing homes, schools and other newer testing sites, only to be deluged by faxes and paper files.
 “It’s definitely a challenge because now we have to do many more things manually than we were with electronic reporting,” said Kristen Ehresmann, of the Minnesota Department of Health.
 Even before Abbott's newest rapid tests hit the market last month, undercounting was a concern.
 Competitors Quidel and Becton Dickinson have together shipped well over 35 million of their own quick tests since June. But that massive influx of tests hasn't showed up in national testing numbers, which have mostly ranged between 750,000 and 950,000 daily tests for months.

If you want some help, there are also online platforms that can help match you with a licensed mental health provider. For example, Talkspace (talkspace.com) and BetterHelp (betterhelp.com), are virtual services you can access through your phone or computer, that contracts with thousands of licensed and credentialed therapists.
 The process starts with a few questions to assess your goals, your condition, and your preferences, and then matches you with some top therapists in your state.
 If you don't have insurance coverage or can't afford therapy, you can call or text 211 (or go to 211.org) anytime for a referral to a provider who offers support at no cost or on a sliding scale, based on your budget.
 You can also call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline 24/7 and ask for a referral to a local resource or provider or ask to be transferred to their “warm line” for nonemergency calls, where you can talk anonymously to a trained professional at no cost.
 Another possible option is Federally Qualified Health Centers, which are community-based health centers, some of which may offer teletherapy services at no-cost. To search for centers in your area visit FindAHealthCenter.hrsa.gov.
 There’s also this website called Open Path Collective (openpathcollective.org), where therapists offer low-cost online sessions for between $30 and $60.
 Interview Your Therapist
 Before you start sessions with a therapist, it’s important to make sure he or she meets your needs. If you’re not comfortable with the person, you’re unlikely to benefit from the therapy. So, schedule a call or a video chat to get a feel for each other, and to ask about the therapist’s training, years in practice, specialties, therapy techniques and fee. Ideally, the therapist you choose will be a good personality fit for you and will be within your budget and/or covered by your insurance.

As its name suggests, the Standardized Emergency Management System helps institutions as different as a massive utility and a rural county enter a public disaster with a built-in plan. The blueprint covers a range of issues, including how to share information and how to structure emergency operation centers. It also creates a common vocabulary -- an important tool given the collision of jargon and acronyms when jurisdictions converge.
 Responding to a disaster requires improvisation, much like a jazz band performance, said Chris Godley, director of emergency management in fire- besieged Sonoma County. An untrained PG&E last year was like having a stranger come to the show with their instrument, “walk onto the stage and just jump into the middle of the song.”
 That might work if the new player has skills. When it came to emergency management, PG&E did not.
 Others likened the dynamic to a team that shows up without knowing the rules of the game, or an aircraft pilot who doesn’t communicate with air traffic control.
 The revelation of just how unprepared the utility was comes as PG&E tries to repair damage done by a decade of criminal recklessness and cover-ups that culminated in wildfires which killed more than 140 people and destroyed nearly 28,000 homes and other buildings. PG&E spent 17 months in bankruptcy court hashing out $25.5 billion in settlements to pay for the devastation it wreaked.
 Hoping to avoid even more calamity, PG&E embraced training, turning to state experts for online sessions that introduce the Standardized Emergency Management System. During 2020, about 90% of the 676 workers in its emergency centers have completed the required initial training, the utility told AP in a statement.

Trump has succeeded in a hostile takeover of the Republican Party, which has chosen to give him free rein.

His biggest supporters forgive his many personal failings, his bombast, his tweets and his lies because they believe, in spite of all this, that he speaks for them and will pursue their wished-for agenda. Despite the many contradictions in his agenda and his all-too-evident personal flaws, many Americans share Trump’s sense that the country has lost its way and needs a renewed sense of self- assertion, both domestically and internationally. The country is more divided and polarised than at any time since the 1930s. The divide between the urban and the rural, the coasts and the heartland, the rich and the poor, the socially liberal and the socially conservative has never been greater.

I said in my previous point that Pope Francis proposes “Faith, and the humanism it inspires” as the foundation for future action. In a strict sense, humanism proposes human solutions to human problems without any reference to God or religious beliefs. In fact, some critics of Pope Francis have labelled him a humanist in this atheistic sense. Yet, Pope Francis is not afraid to use the word humanism, because unlike atheistic humanism, Pope Francis bases his humanism on the Gospel and the example of Jesus Christ. For example, Jesus’ statement, “The sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath” (Mk 2:28) puts the human person right at the center of his ministry. The Good Samaritan too could be called a humanist, in that, he disregarded all cultural, historical, and religious boundaries and put a wounded and helpless person in the center. It was an act of selfless and outgoing love.

 The German, who lost the U.S. Open final last month and exited the French Open in the fourth round, needed only an hour and 20 minutes to get the better of the 20-year-old Canadian thanks to a dominant service game.
 Zverev, 23, won 80% of his first service points and an overwhelming 88% on his second serve while he also converted four of 10 break points to hand Auger- Aliassime -- who is still searching for his first title -- a sixth defeat in a final.
 "I had a very tough final in New York and the next final I played here I wanted to come out and obviously play my best tennis," Zverev said.
 "Felix, you're an unbelievable player. I know it doesn't mean much right now, but I'm sure you're not only going to win one title, you're going to win multiple titles in your career, bigger titles than this."
 Victory gave Zverev his 12th ATP title and his third on home soil after he won the Munich Open in 2017 and 2018.
 Zverev has already qualified for the season-ending ATP Finals in London next month but will remain in Cologne for the bett1HULKS Championships next week where he is again the top seed. (Reporting by Rohith Nair in Bengaluru; Editing by Hugh Lawson)

 # Alvarez: It's been a bittersweet Hispanic Heritage Month
 Lubbock Avalanche-Journal
 September 15 to October 15 marked Hispanic Heritage Month. This year, it fell right as early voting began for the 2020 election, where Latinx votes could make a crucial difference.
 In this rare moment when we have the country’s eyes and ears, I wish I could just highlight the ways in which we’re thriving and be done with it. Alas, I must pair each piece of positive news with a harsh dose of reality.
 We are growing as a portion of the U.S. population. There are now 61 million of us here — a fact I can’t acknowledge without also mourning the 40,000 members of my community who have perished from COVID-19.
 I could also talk about how this year, Latinxs became the largest minority group in the electorate. But any discussion of our votes must address the voter suppression we face.
 This November, when more votes are expected to be cast by mail than at any other point in this country’s history, we should be concerned about the fact that our absentee ballots are disproportionately rejected.
 Compounding that concern is that crucial swing states like Arizona, Texas, Georgia, and Florida, any of which could tilt the balance of power in the 2020 presidential election, all have documented histories of suppressing Latinx voters.
 Then there’s our money. Not only have U.S. Latinxs experienced steady growth both in terms of overall population and size of the electorate, we’ve also expanded our share of the U.S. economy.
 That said, it’s hard to relish any of our recent gains since the pandemic flipped our economic world upside down. COVID-19 hit the Latinx community particularly hard — we now have the highest unemployment rate of any racial or ethnic group.
 Nevertheless, we are a resilient bunch. Latinx unemployment has continued to decrease every month since its peak in April.
 And I haven’t even mentioned that police continue to kill us, along with Black people, at frighteningly disproportionate rates, and with impunity. Since 2015, 936 Latinxs have been killed by police — a fact that should get more attention now that the Black Lives Matter movement has put a giant spotlight on police misconduct.
 It’s been a hard year. We’re digging our way out, but without intentional policy solutions, that process will be much slower. So, what do we need?
 For starters, a health care system that prioritizes care over profits. We know that at least 10 million Latinxs are uninsured. If it weren’t for health insurance being too expensive, tens of thousands of us would likely still be alive, and we wouldn’t be hospitalized at disproportionately high rates from COVID-19.
 We could also pass the Voting Rights Advancement Act, which the House passed last year and is one of a seemingly endless pile of bills sitting on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s desk. The Act would reestablish critical protections for folks in states with histories of voter suppression.
 Two more bills dying on McConnell’s desk that would work wonders for us and all Americans are the Heroes Act and the Justice in Policing Act.
 The Heroes Act would provide $3 trillion in coronavirus relief to workers struggling to make ends meet, pay their rent or mortgage, and put food on the table. And the Justice in Policing Act would outlaw chokeholds, institute a national database for tracking police misconduct, and ban no-knock warrants, among other reforms.
 Is this a lot to ask for? Of course it is. But we give a lot too.
 To me, honoring Hispanic Heritage Month shouldn’t simply be about eating our food, enjoying our music, or celebrating our past. It should be about protecting our future.

“If I were a consummate fan I’d be incapable of making certain business moves because I’d consider the music too precious. My job is to find — or create — a market for a record and that requires me to be a bit ruthless at times. You have to be willful to run a record company and if you ever play victim you’re dead. This business is about survival of the fittest and it requires mental toughness and the ability to bluff.”

It’s that which often goes unnoticed. Rival fans will snigger and call Miedema a flat-track bully, but when big teams target her and try to mark her out of a game, she's clever enough to use that as a weapon to create space for her team-mates to get those goal-scoring opportunities. She doesn't need to score, or assist, to have an impact on the game.

I’ve mentioned before how I try to pace myself when deer season opens. When I was younger, I felt like I had to be in the stand every waking minute. Any hour could be the hour that buck walked by. Granted, I didn’t have trail cameras to verify anything, but I still should have known my odds were not as good early in the year. While there was nothing wrong with being early and often, my problem was fatigue. By the time the pre-rut was taking place it was hard for me to drag myself out of bed to get in the stand. And by the time the second rut was taking place, I was finding every excuse to stay home while everyone else was sending me pictures of their best buck ever. So, for the past several years, unless I have a trophy on camera, I will wait until late October before I ever get into that stand. I still want to be eager to get up during the second week of December when the biggest bucks show up.
 Whenever I think about this scenario, I’m always reminded of the words of one pastor. He quoted Amy Carmichael. “I would rather burn out than rust out.” Of course, this sounded admirable. He was bragging about long workdays, no days off, and no vacations. He thought God must be proud of this remarkable commitment and heralded the fact that any worthwhile man or woman of God ought to do the same. What he didn’t realize (or didn’t care about) were the needs of those who called him dad, husband and friend, and about God’s own command to care for his own body which was the temple of the Holy Spirit. He thought the only two options were burning out and rusting out. He never thought about the possibility of a third – planning it out. Plan out working enough, resting enough, and even playing enough, that when the end comes, there will not only be fruit, but longevity – there will not only be worthwhile accomplishments in the lives of parishioners, but worthwhile accomplishments in the lives of those who sometimes physically look up to him as well. I have not always followed my own advice, but I’ve always remembered that God doesn’t need me. He LETS me. And the longer I can stick around, the better chance I have of not only being the leader I need to be, but being the human I need to be as well.

Flood risk is also a concern, Naughton says. Flooding isn’t covered by regular homeowners insurance policies, and typically only homes in the highest-risk zones are required by mortgage lenders to buy special flood policies. But the federal government’s flood maps may understate the risk to many properties, especially as hurricanes get stronger and bring intense rainfall along with larger storm surges.

He is still working his way through some of the nuances of game play amid the pandemic The absence of full crowds at stadiums can be, well, a game-changer. "No crowd is like no net under a high wire for me," Buck confesses. "I think it forces people to try to drum up excitement that doesn't exist." His philosophy: "Let's have the raw emotion of what happens in the stadium, good or bad. That's always been kind of my ace in the hole, whether I've been at Yankee Stadium or Wrigley Field or Lambeau Field." And while those noises may in this era be added to the mix by leagues and networks, he says, he tries to work off of it. "Whatever you are hearing at home, I'm making sure I hear in my headset."
