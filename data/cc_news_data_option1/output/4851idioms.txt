The Nintendo Switch Lite is a more affordable model of the Nintendo Switch that can play all the same games and comes in at $100 less than the standard version, with the biggest difference between the two being that the Switch Lite cannot be connected to a TV for the big screen experience. It's no shock then that this $200 console isn't seeing a discount on Black Friday. The console was released only a little over a year ago with very few deals ever offered on the Lite model. During 2020, some retailers even had trouble keeping this model in stock at its regular cost.

Still more than a month away, next year's tennis calendar is already in limbo.      The biggest story for 2021 right now is, of course, the Australian Open and really the entire Australian summer. After all, that is what's first up on the schedule-or  _supposed to be_  first up on the schedule, at least.      It remains to be seen what the summer Down Under will look like, where it will be, and when it will take place. One proposed scenario has not only the Australian Open but also all of the warmup events being held in a Melbourne bubble. Among many issues is the question of when players can arrive in Victoria (the state in which Melbourne is located) and how long they have to quarantine before resuming tennis activities.      The 2021 Australian Open was-and still is-scheduled to begin on Jan. 18. That start date could be pushed back to Jan. 25 or perhaps even the first week of February.

We know that the M1 Mac mini and MacBooks have been received pretty positively, but any transition from old tech to new tech is bound to have a few hiccups. It's entirely possible that certain apps you may need for your day-to-day operations may not function properly or suffer from technical glitches until developers have a chance to update for the new hardware. If you're nervous about being a brand new iMac that has a brand new chip in it, there's no reason not to jump on this deal while you can.

The G903 offers everything the G502 does and then some (hence the slightly higher price). It goes toe-to-toe with it on the DPI count and number of programmable buttons - though some of those will be hard to reach, which is a downside to the ambidextrous nature. Nevertheless, the seven or so programmable buttons that will be easy to click are usually more than enough, and this beauty is _wireless_. You can't go wrong.

“We have to create our own energy,” said Iowa preseason All-American Luka Garza, who had 26 points and 10 rebounds in a win over North Carolina Central. “As a basketball player, I have no problem doing that. I play the same whether I’m at LA Fitness or in front of 15,000 fans.”
 Ten members of the top-ranked South Carolina women’s team followed the social justice lead of the NBA and WNBA by remaining seated for the national anthem before their 119-38 win over Charleston.
 “We just wanted everyone to know we haven’t forgotten about what’s going on,” guard Zia Cooke said. “Of course, this is a basketball game, but we wanted to use our platform.”
 Numerous other teams sat or knelt during the anthem, including North Carolina State’s women. The Virginia men’s team had “UNITY” on their warm-up shirts and Towson’s players had a raised fist on their backs.
 Georgetown coach Patrick Ewing made a different kind of statement during the Hoyas’ season-opening game against Maryland-Baltimore County, draping a white towel over his shoulder in memory John Thompson. Several other coaches followed suit to honor the Hall of Fame coach who died in August at 78.
 Some teams never made it to the floor.
 Georgia’s opener against Columbus State was canceled just hours before tipoff due to positive COVID-19 tests within the Division II team. Lipscomb’s game against Campbellsville Harrodsburg also was canceled due to coronavirus issues.
 On the women’s side, No. 9 UCLA had its game called off after an 80-minute wait for Cal State Fullerton to get COVID-19 test results and Rutgers’ opener was called off due to a positive test in Monmouth’s program.
 “This is obviously a situation unlike any other I’ve had to deal with in my 31 seasons of coaching college basketball,” Georgia coach Tom Crean said. “This season already was a surreal experience all around. This is truly that.”
 Oklahoma and Monmouth became the latest teams to pause all activities due to positive COVID-19 tests.
 The game went on mostly as usual on the court.
 Drake pulled off the first upset of the season, winning 80-70 at Kansas State. Montana State of the Big Sky Conference followed with a 91-78 rout at UNLV, Saint Francis (Pa.) beat Pittsburgh for the first time in 30 tries and Georgia State beat Georgia Tech in four overtimes for its first win over an ACC team.
 Illinois senior Ayo Dosunmu showed off why he was a preseason All-American, finishing with 28 points, 10 rebounds and five assists in a 122-60 win over North Carolina A&T.
 Heralded Oklahoma State freshman Cade Cunningham, another preseason All- American, had a stellar debut, finishing with 21 points and 10 rebounds in a 75-68 win over Texas-Arlington.
 The day before Thanksgiving, players, coaches and fans were thankful to have college basketball back. Where it goes from here, nobody knows.

Slated for three months later on the calendar, the Mutua Madrid Open hopes to be dealing with no such coronavirus-related issues. Regardless, though, the tournament confirmed on Wednesday that it will be a two-week event in 2021-similar to fellow Masters 1000s in Indian Wells and Miami. The Madrid Masters will begin on April 27 and run through May 9.      Like Indian Wells and Miami, main-draw action will begin in the middle of the first week before the finals are held on the second Sunday.      "We’re happy to have achieved the goal of becoming a two-week tournament," TD Feliciano Lopez announced. "We sought this expansion and it is well-deserved, necessary and will allow us to enjoy the best tennis in the world at the Caja Mágica for a few more days. I’m sure that both our sponsors and all the fans will welcome this news with open arms, as well as the city of Madrid, which will receive more visitors for a longer period of time."

It was a close one, but this past Sunday Arizona sidestepped the Buffalo Bills for a 32-30 win. Having forecasted a close victory for Arizona, the oddsmakers were right on the money. It was another big night for their QB Kyler Murray, who passed for one TD and 245 yards on 32 attempts in addition to rushing for two TDs and 61 yards. Murray ended up with a passer rating of 137.10.
