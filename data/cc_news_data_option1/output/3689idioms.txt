On Tuesday night, the Nuggets reversed yet another double-digit deficit en route to flat out blasting the Los Angeles Clippers to the tune of a 104-89 Game 7 victory. It's tempting to call the result stunning. But was it? These Nuggets have been in four Game 7s in the past two postseasons, and they've now won three of them. Jamal Murray and Nikola Jokic are superstars. Yes, _superstars_. The scoring consistency perhaps isn't there for Murray yet, but you'd be hard pressed to find more than three point guards you'd rather have in a one-game scenario, certainly when your back is against the wall.

Solskjaer ended up bolstering his striking options with the loan addition of Odion Ighalo following Haaland's rejection and the Nigerian has proved to be a useful back up to Anthony Martial. While a new forward isn't currently a priority given the Frenchman's current form, expect United to return to the market for a new forward when Ighalo's loan spell ends in January. The Reds should look no further than Salzburg for their new recruit.
 In Haaland's absence, one man has stepped up to the plate - Zambian international Patson Daka.
 The 21-year-old joined Salzburg in 2017 and was placed in their youth setup, helping the Austrian side win the UEFA Youth League before making his senior debut for the club in the following season. Haaland's extraordinary form restricted him to mostly substitute appearances but Daka took his chances when given a starting berth, ending the season with 24 goals in 31 appearances including eight assists.
 With Haaland out of the picture, Daka is now the main man in Salzburg and has made a fast start to the new campaign, netting in the first league win of the season as well as scoring four in the opening round of the Austrian Cup. Rumours are already starting to begin that Daka could be the next Salzburg star to make the jump to a top European side with Tottenham and Arsenal linked with a move for the forward.

This is going to be different. Very different.


  There will be fewer games this fall sports season, fewer fans at those games, no sectional or state tournament championships as the carrot on the end of the stick in front of the players as well as more new rules and safety precautions than you can shake that same stick at.


  How things look at the field will be different, too, with everyone bringing their own water bottles, limited, if any use of the locker rooms as well as social distancing whenever possible on the sidelines.


  This is going to be a very different season, but at least it is actually happening. That's surely going to bring smiles to student-athletes, coaches and athletic directors all across the Patriot League as we get ready to play some games.


  The first day for fall sports practices is Friday, Sept. 18 with games in the condensed regular season schedule starting about 10 days after that.


  Other high schools in Eastern Mass. are working with a different situation than what's happening with the Patriot League. The South Shore League has pushed their opening day to Sept. 25 while the South Coast Conference has moved all of their fall sports opportunities to the new Fall II season that will open at the end of February.


  "I think we've got a good plan to go forward with the season," said Hingham High AD Jim Quatromoni, who spent a bunch of time this summer working as a member of the MIAA's COVID-19 safety task force. "We've set down the guidelines for the way we are going to play sports this fall and we'll all have to make some adjustments to make it work.


  "But the most important thing is we need to give these kids a chance to play sports again in as safe a way as possible."


  Rule changes are numerous in all of the fall sports. But the biggest change was the move of football, cheerleading as well as unified basketball to the Fall II season that will begin on Feb. 22, 2021 and go on until April 25 when the calendar will flip to the regular spring sports season.


  Another big change this year is the official addition of Marshfield into the Patriot League mix. Marshfield competed as an independent school when the Atlantic Coast League disbanded at the end of the 2018 spring season. They eventually fit in as an adopted member of the Patriot League last year and filled most of their schedules against those teams.


  Marshfield was officially added to the Patriot League earlier this year and will fit nicely into the Keenan Division with Plymouth North, Silver Lake, Hingham, Duxbury and Whitman-Hanson. The Fisher Division side of the ledger is now filled with Plymouth South, Quincy, North Quincy, Scituate, Pembroke as well as Hanover.


  The league has unofficially adopted another school this sports season with Notre Dame Academy of Hingham filling in non-league slots on a lot of girls soccer, field hockey and volleyball schedules this fall.


  "It made a lot of sense to invite NDA into our bubble. They come from a small league and a lot of the teams they play are quite a distance away," Quatromoni said. "They were in a bad situation and I'm glad we were able to help them out a little bit and give them some games."


  NDA-Hingham Athletic Director Kristen McGill-Kelly said the help of the Patriot League "was much appreciated. We were on a little bit of an island with other Catholic Conference schools like Ursuline, Fontbonne and Mt. Alvernia, so not having to travel so far to play games will be good for us.


  "We're absolutely ready to go and looking forward to the season," McGill- Kelly added. "There's lots of things that still need to be worked out in the next couple weeks but we are grateful for the chance to play."


  There will be some new faces leading the Patriot League programs this year. Justin Domingos picked up his office and moved a couple exits down Route 3, leaving Pembroke to take over the Plymouth North athletic program. Brian Phillips is now the athletic director at Pembroke High while Billy Battis has shed the interim from his title and is now the permanent AD for Marshfield High.


  "It's been an interesting month, but I'm ready to get the fall season going," said Phillips, who's been on the job for the Titans for about two weeks. "The other AD's in the league have been great about getting me up to speed as quickly as possible as I try to get my feet wet.


  "We're all in the same boat right now as we try to figure out the best way to do this for everyone's safety. The key is staying flexible at all levels for whatever could come at us."


  Domingos said things were "falling together pretty nicely" at Plymouth North where the regular season will begin the last week of this month with a pair of golf matches. "There are still some loose ends that need to be tied up but nothing that will hold us back. The schedules look good and the busing situation in lining up, so that's good.


  "The kids and the coaches are just excited that they'll have the chance to play some games once again."


  Across America's Hometown, things are also coming together at Plymouth South, the defending league champion in both football as well as boys cross country.


  "The nice thing for us is we have great athletic facilities at Plymouth South, so everyone will be ready to go on the 18th," said Panthers AD Scott Fry. "We're all on board. I'm sure there are going to be changes to the way we've done things in the past, but I believe that the student-athletes and the coaches will do anything needed to make this situation work.


  "It's going to be a different season, but we are pleased at the opportunity to even have a season after what happened with the spring athletes. Something is still better than nothing."


  Silver Lake AD Martha Jamieson said the fall season will be a "fluid situation" with schools having to turn on a dime if the situation calls for it.


  "You can't really plan way ahead for what we'll see this season but I think we can still get this done safely for everyone involved. Everyone's health and safety has to be our #1 priority," Jamieson said. "We just have to take one step at a time and meet all of the challenges that will pop up as we get things rolling."


  Jamieson said the Lakers will see some changes for the fall season, one being the movement of the starting line for cross country meets because of space restrictions.


  "The fortunate thing for me as an AD is that I have a solid, stable and veteran coaching staff to lean on and help everyone get through this."


  Scheduling games in the Patriot League for soccer, volleyball, golf and field hockey follows a pretty easy pattern. Teams will play the other five teams in their league twice and then play one non-division contest to add up to 11 games.


  While there will be no sectional or state tournaments this season, teams will have the Patriot League Cup to play for this season. Teams will be seeded at the end of the regular season and will play at least a couple of games on the way to deciding the winner of the inaugural Cup.


  "The Patriot Cup came from an idea floated by Duxbury High AD Thom Holdgate and everyone jumped right on board to make it happen," Domingos said. "It's a great way to keep everyone involved until the very end of the season."


  "I love the idea of having the Patriot Cup tournament at the end of the season," Quatromoni said. "Not only will it give teams something to shoot for at the end of the schedule, it will also give teams a chance to play even more games."


  "It is a nice way to end the season," said Fry. "It's a pretty creative way to give kids an opportunity to play more games."

Thomas L. Schwartz, age 79 of Eau Claire, passed away on Sept. 10, 2020 at Mayo Healthcare Hospital in Eau Claire, WI, due to complications of cardiac amyloidosis.
 Tom was born Nov. 16, 1940, to Clarence and Iona (Olson) Schwartz, in Eau Claire, WI. He grew up there, graduating from EC Memorial HS in 1959. He went on to graduate from UW-Eau Claire in 1963, with a degree in Economics. Tom worked a short time at Northern Engraving in Sparta. It was there he met his love, Val (Schultz) Schwartz. They were married May 30, 1964. Tom and Val eventually put down roots in Eau Claire where they raised their son, Joe. While Joe was growing up, Tom was active in coaching youth sports including baseball, basketball and football. He and Val never missed one of Joe’s games.
 Tom spent the rest of his career serving the students of UW-Eau Claire as the Associate Director of Housing. After 35 years of number crunching and overseeing many new projects, Tom retired in 2002. He made many good friends during his time at the university. He closely followed Blugold basketball and became friends with many UWEC student athletes and coaches. His favorite part of his job was supervising many students during summer employment. Tom stayed in touch with many of them right up until his passing.
 Tom was an avid fisherman and hunter. Tom had a great love for the outdoors and his favorite pastime was hunting grouse and pheasants with his dog, Skip. Tom was a voracious reader and enjoyed studying history and politics. He enjoyed following Badger athletics and the Green Bay Packers. Tom also enjoyed many years of swimming with his pals at McPhee Center and later on, at the YMCA in Eau Claire.
 Nothing brought Tom greater joy, however, than time spent with his son and his family. Tom is survived by his wife, Val, Eau Claire; son, Joe and his wife, Tracy, and their children, Owen, Noah, and Emerson, of Aurora, IL. Tom was a doting grandpa who spent many hours playing toy trains with his grandsons, rearranging train tracks and complying with their every wish. He enjoyed teasing them, traveling with them and imparting his grandfatherly wisdom. Tom enjoyed time with his only granddaughter, Emerson, calling her "Dolly" and for the first time ever, playing with all things pink. He will be fondly remembered for his sense of humor and good natured spirit.
 Tom is further survived by a sister-in-law, Marlene Kastenschmidt, brother-in- law, Howard (Lois) Schultz, of Tomah, nieces, nephews, cousins and other relatives. He was preceded in death by his parents and his in-laws, Carl and Linda Schultz.
 Visitation will be held on Saturday, Sept. 19 from 10am-12pm at the WEST CHAPEL location of Lenmark-Gomsrud-Linn Funeral Home, 1405 N. Clairemont Ave., Eau Claire. A private service will take place at 12pm at the funeral home. Due to COVID restrictions, face coverings will be required in the funeral home. Burial will be in Rest Haven Cemetery in Eau Claire.
 In lieu of flowers, donations may be made in honor of Tom to the Amyloidosis Foundation at amyloidosis.org or to Spirit Lutheran Church of Eau Claire.

Thompson’s Cement Ridge allotment is in a portion of the Black Hills National Forest, which has not been commercially logged for the better part of 30 years.
 “What that did was, it created a really late-stage succession up here, to where all of the trees were really old so they were more susceptible to the pine beetle when it came through,” he said.
 Thompson said the pine beetle infestation helped set the stage for a series of years with significant tree fallings, which caused massive destruction to his fence lines.
 “Consequently a ton of timber came down on the fence, and we went through … and got it put back together. It was a ton of work, but we did it anyway. And then the next year you go back and it was the exact same thing,” he said. “Those pockets of dead timber; you get one cleaned up and then another one would open up the next year, and then another one, and then (Winter Storm) Atlas hit in ’13.”
 The early October storm dumped about five feet of heavy snow, coupled with strong winds, sent dead standing trees to the ground.
 The cleanup and fence repair from Winter Storm Atlas and the previous years, along with the average wear and tear associated with maintaining fence, kept Thompson busy for the majority of the following five years.
 “Then in June of ’18, we had a tornado come through here. It started over sort of Grand Canyon and over to Moskee (Wyo.) ground up through Pole Cabin Draw right up over the top of the (Cement Ridge Lookout) tower and over in to private land around the top of Tinton,” he said.
 The EF1 tornado was on the ground for 19 miles, according to the National Weather Service.
 Fortunately for Thompson, that tornado ran through the southern portion of his allotment, while his cattle where feeding in the northern pasture.
 “If it had been a year when we turned down the south (pasture), they would have been right in the middle of it when it came through. It would’ve been really ugly,” Thompson said.
 Most of the rest of that summer was spent just cleaning up the trail of destruction left by that tornado.
 “We didn’t get anything done that year, it was just a free-for-all up here,” Thompson said. “We didn’t get all of it put back up after the tornado, but we got a lot of it put back together.”

For the thousands of freshmen who enter Cornell for the first time in the fall, finding a community while balancing the demands of an unfamiliar environment is a perennially daunting task — and doing so mostly online amid an unprecedented health crisis is that much more challenging.
 Aiming to make that process more bearable for new and returning undergraduates alike, Black Students United hosted the typically in-person “Black Life on the Hill” on Thursday night via Zoom, giving students the chance to hear from campus organizations which hone into Black student life.
 “I just wanted to say welcome to the freshmen. I know these are kind of weird circumstances that we're in right now, and my heart really goes out for you guys,” said Ezi Osuoha ’22, co-president of Building Ourselves Through Sisterhood and Service. “But I'm glad that BSU brought us all together so you guys can see the wonderful resources and family that we have in the Black community here at Cornell.”
 Leaders from clubs gave brief overviews of their organizations’ missions and application requirements before the event’s over 120 attendees broke out into smaller discussion groups to learn more. Thirty clubs were represented during the course of the two-hour session, spanning the spectrum from social to pre- professional to cultural.
 The event was an “amazing success,” said BSU co-chair Lassan Bagayoko ’22. While virtual recruitment remains an unprecedented challenge for Cornell’s campus organizations — typically accustomed to quartercarding and social events to attract and retain new members — Bagayoko said the event’s strong attendance and engagement among attendees showed that it is a more than attainable feat.
 Richmond Addae ’23 encouraged students to consider joining Cornell’s Pan- African Student Association, a group that aims to “foster strong solidarity among identifying African-descendent people, allies of the continent … and the scholars of the cultural, political, economic and social issues of contemporary or historical significance to Africa.”
 Traditionally, Addae said, one of the club’s marquee events is the Afrik! fashion show, which hosts designers from across the United States to showcase Afrocentric design.
 Tyler Correa-White ’21 spoke on behalf of BlackGen Capital, which made history as Cornell’s first underrepresented minority-owned investment fund at the University. The 35-member group is currently working to raise $30,000 in assets under management.
 “This org[anization] was started because Black and Hispanic students at Cornell had disproportionately less access to financial education, which is reflected in the greater diversity issue that exists on Wall Street,” Correa- White said.
 Rainer Sanvil ’21, co-president of Underrepresented Minorities in Computing, introduced his organization, an over 250-person group dedicated to empowering minorities to seek careers in technological industries. According to Sanvil, the organization offers students a slew of resources, including workshops by companies, member-led office hours, mock interviews and sponsorship to professional conferences.
 “We want to make sure we have a lot of participation from a lot of different parties … which is why this event was such an amazing success,” Bagayoko said. “We really tried to pull from the entire community.”

PEORIA -- The IHSA says it is game on -- make that more games on -- for high school teams sorting through the competition rules and regulations amid a pandemic.
   
 Change is good, albeit often in the COVID-19 era.
   
 The IHSA has lifted its competition restrictions that limited winter, spring and summer sports to two games per week, rolling back to normal schedule limits.
   
 And the summer season, which involves baseball, softball, boys track and field, girls soccer, boys volleyball, lacrosse and boys tennis, can begin practices and games two weeks earlier than previously announced.
   
 For now, anyway.
   
 "We were limited to two matches per week," Dunlap volleyball head coach and Central Illinois Elite Volleyball Club director Jennifer Bartlett said. "I think adding back a significant number of matches would be very doable for us. But that will be up to our school officials. Do we add matches and then there's going to be another change later?
   
 "I'm not looking at it too much. It's like every day they change something. For the longest time I had to wait to see if there was going to be a season.
   
 "I don't know what's going to happen next. None of us do. I'm done with worrying about it.
   
 "This IHSA adjustment is a positive thing, but as always, the key word is 'If.' "
   
 That was somewhat echoed by Peoria High girls basketball head coach Meechie Edwards.
   
 "Things change so rapidly with this pandemic," he said. "It's been a rollercoaster. But I'm excited to get these changes. We just don't know what's next. It might change again next week. So we're just going to do what we can.
   
 "We have six or seven freshman coming into the team, good players. But those freshman didn't have summer development because of COVID shutdowns, and that will be difficult for them. More games will certainly be important for them. We have a chance to be really, really good."
   
 Lewistown softball coach Joey McLaughlin sees the two weeks added as dodging what felt like a repeat of last season's COVID shutdown as the IHSA's initial plan struggled to jam in multiple sports into its 2020 summer lineup.
   
 "That's one thing that I will say that I was happy with to get the extra two weeks, considering we were shorted an entire season last year and then (the IHSA was) going to try and short our season again this year," he said. "I was happy with those two weeks."
   
 As for summer sports, the original COVID-adjusted competition plan was for first practices on May 3 and first contests on May 17.
   
 That has been moved ahead now to April 19 and May 3, respectively.
   
 It's a chance for kids to play more games, especially in baseball and softball.
   
 "It's a great benefit," said Notre Dame baseball coach Cory Birdoes. "Basically what it does, it allows us to have somewhat of a season, develop players, see players, give them at-bats, things that they missed out on the last couple of years.
   
 "Adding games isn't going to hurt."
   
 And what about the overlap of spring and summer sports?
   
 "I'd rather have my kids play other sports anyway," Birdoes said. "It just makes them a better athlete."
   
 It could, however, be a challenge for coaches.
   
 "For my own personal reasons, I'm still trying to wrap playing in June around my brain," Farmington softball coach Jeni Fauser said. "I don't want to go through like last year where the seniors didn't get to play, so I'm glad there's a season.
   
 "There's still a lot of sacrifices being made by coaches and players to do this.
   
 "We share a lot of the athletes. I'm afraid some kids will just think, 'If (softball) is not my No. 1 sport, do I really want to go into something else?' Especially if they've played basketball, volleyball, then boom (softball)."
   
 The extra two weeks and the lift of weekly competition limits should help track and field, too. But is it too little, too late?
   
 "I think it is great to give the kids a chance to possibly compete in more meets and this may give us a chance at having a state series," Richwoods boys track and field coach Roland Brown said. "I think we are in a bit of a tough situation with half the season being conducted when school is not in session, I would guess numbers will be affected.
   
 "Most of us will probably be doing some type of pre-season training before April any way."

Sally was a rare storm that could make history, said Ed Rappaport, deputy director of the National Hurricane Center.
 “Sally has a characteristic that isn’t often seen and that’s a slow forward speed and that’s going to exacerbate the flooding,” Rappaport told The Associated Press.
 He likened the storm’s slow progression to that of Hurricane Harvey, which swamped Houston in 2017. Up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rain could fall in some spots, and “that would be record-setting in some locations,” Rappaport said in an interview Tuesday night.
 Although the hurricane had the Alabama and Florida coasts in its sights Wednesday, its effects were felt all along the northern Gulf Coast. Low lying properties in southeast Louisiana were swamped by the surge. Water covered Mississippi beaches and parts of the highway that runs parallel to them. Two large casino boats broke loose from a dock where they were undergoing construction work in Alabama.
 Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves urged people in the southern part of his state to prepare for the potential for flash flooding.
 After dumping rain on the coast Wednesday, Sally was forecast to bring heavy downpours to parts of Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and the Carolinas later in the week.
 Sally’s power was an irresistible draw for some in its path.
 With heavy rains pelting Navarre Beach, Fla., and the wind-whipped surf pounding, a steady stream of people walked down the wooden boardwalk at a park for a look at the scene Tuesday afternoon.
 Rebecca Studstill, who lives inland, was wary of staying too long, noting that police close bridges once the wind and water get too high. With Hurricane Sally expected to dump rain for days, the problem could be worse than normal, she said.
 “Just hunkering down would probably be the best thing for folks out here,” she said.

“When has America been great for African Americans in the ghetto of America?” the pastor asked.
 Asked about what he was doing to address protests against racial injustice, Trump lamented a “lack of respect” and the absence of “retribution” for those who clash with or carry out attacks against police officers. Trump on Sunday called for the death penalty for the individual who shot and critically injured two Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department deputies over the weekend.
 Trump has been unusually mum on his debate preparations ahead of the first debate, set to take place in Cleveland. On Tuesday, he told Fox News that he believes his day job is the best practice for his three scheduled showdowns with Biden.
 “Well, I sort of prepare every day by just doing what I’m doing,” Trump said. He noted that he had been in California on Monday and had been to other states before that to make the point that he’s getting out and about more than Biden.
 One person likely to study the replay: Biden. Returning from a long day of campaigning in Florida, Biden said at his plane that he was preparing for the debates mostly by going back through what Trump has said in the past. But he suggested he had yet to initiate mock debates, saying he was unaware who would play the role of Trump in his preparations.
 Trump, in the Fox interview, lowered expectations for his Democratic opponent's performance, judging Biden “a disaster” and “grossly incompetent” in the primary debates. He assessed Biden as “OK” and “fine” in his final one- on-one debate with Bernie Sanders before clinching the nomination.

All told, the tornado of 2018 destroyed around eight to 10 miles of fencing between Thompson and two other permittees in the area. The summer of 2019 seemed to be a blissfully peaceful season by comparison for Thompson, but all of the upheaval from the past half-decade had marred the land.
 “In ’19, nothing too awful happened. We were getting there,” he recalled. “Then this spring I come up … and here’s all these trees tipped over on my nice new fence again, which was demoralizing to say the least.”
 Because so many of the older trees had been uprooted and knocked down in such rapid-fire succession, the newer, younger trees that were growing in their place didn’t have the added protection from the elements provided by larger, stronger predecessors.
 “There’s always been kind of an old wives tale about if you go through and remove a bunch of timber, what you leave is then weaker,” Thompson said.
 And weaker they were. The damage from the July 6 tornado, an EF2, was so extensive Thompson had to hire a crew to fix the fence line in order to make the deadline for fence repairs, set by the National Forest Service.
 “Four guys worked for a week, and on the fourth day … they called me and said, ‘Ahhhh hey, something happened up here last night, all the stuff that we had done has got trees on it again and is ruined,’” Thompson said. “And that was the second tornado that went through up here.”
 The EF1 tornado followed a similar path as the June 2018 storm weather officials said.
 Since then, Thompson said there has been another tornado through his area and something the weather service categorized as “a straight-line wind event.”
 He said the Forest Service has been very understanding throughout the anomalous weather.
 “They’ve been really understanding through all this. They’ve been super good partners in giving us time to work through this,” he said.
 Thompson explained that as the allotment holder, it’s his responsibility to have at least a percentage of all his fence repairs completed by June 16.
 “We have a responsibility to maintain all range improvements, and there’s guidelines,” he said. “It doesn’t happen very often, but you could end up losing your allotment over the deal.”
 Although the past few years have provided Thompson with some unique challenges, he said managing his grazing allotments is one aspect of being a rancher he enjoys the most.
 “This is one of my favorite parts of my job. This so closely resembles recreation that a lot of people do in the forest, that it’s almost indistinguishable,” he said. “The simple fact that part of my job description is, ‘get in your Jeep, go drive around the forest and look at stuff,’ that’s pretty cool.”

“It’s always great as a coach to see your girls come out and fight like that,” Coach Paula Carman said. “We were kind of struggling and have been doing that lately. Everybody has been a little indecisive. It took us a little bit. I know it’s in there. We saw it tonight, and now we’ve got to keep focusing on that.”
 The fourth set comeback was a turnabout for how the first and third sets played out. Treynor claimed both frames with late rallies, rattling off six of seven in the first and overcoming three set points in the third.
 That momentum carried into the fourth with Treynor scoring nine of the first 13 and building a lead up to 19-14. That’s when Rus found her rhythm with kills on points 17, 18, 19, 23, 24 and 25.
 “I just got an adrenaline rush,” Rus said. “I wanted to push and win, so I got a lot louder on and off the court. I think that really got the team up.”
 Macy VanFossan topped the Eagles with 23 kills, 26 digs and three aces in her usual all-around brilliant performance. Peyton Cook passed out 50 assists and added 18 digs, and Rus managed 16 kills, 10 digs and four aces.
 “Zoe came through really big in set four,” Carman said. “She came through with some big swings and some great accuracy at that time, and that’s exactly what we needed.”
 “I just kept telling Peyton (Cook) to keep setting me,” Rus said. “I won’t stop until I get set. I just kept doing what I was doing over and over again.”

“We had some really good scrimmages last week and we played so much better than we did tonight. And I think that’s the disappointing part for me and the girls, just to come in and not get it done in the home opener,” Tem-Cats head coach JoAnna Vaden said. “We just have to dig deep and make sure it doesn’t happen again.”
 Temple has two more chances this week to notch home victories, with matches against Waco on Friday and Waco University on Saturday.
 But back to Tuesday, the Tem-Cats’ Ali Mack posted a team-high seven kills and two blocks, Abi Kinney chipped in four kills, and Amaya Benekin delivered 13 assists.
 Catyn Wright paced the Lady Cougars (14-0) with 10 kills, Kadyne Emmot and Karley Baker had six kills apiece, and Dylan Birks and Hayli Case landed four each. Kayla Peoples recorded 15 assists and four service aces among China Spring’s 11 aces overall.
 “Our serve-receive was way off. They are a hard-hitting team. I’m not taking anything away from them. They had some really good serves and we weren’t adjusting well,” Vaden added. “Ali Mack did a great job on the front line. Abi Kinney came through and had some good hits for us, and Amaya is working to get to the ball to set them up. We just didn’t function as a team like I’ve seen them function through the summer.”
 Temple rallied at various times in each set. In Games 1 and 3, the Tem-Cats made things interesting in the middle portion. In Game 2, Temple kept it close early. In every instance, though, the Lady Cougars found ways to pull away.
 China Spring sprinted to an 18-6 lead in the opening set, a deficit Temple whittled to 19-13 before the Lady Cougars closed with six of the next nine points.
 The Tem-Cats were up 3-1 and 4-3 in Game 2 only to have China Spring rattle off runs of 7-0, 8-0 and 5-0 en route to a 2-0 match advantage.
 And in the third, Temple clawed back from eight down to get within 14-10. But the Lady Cougars charged to the finish line with an 11-4 burst.
 “I thought we played well. We are just trying to fix us and grow every day,” China Spring coach Melissa Cole said. “We start district next week and we are playing teams we don’t know anything about because they haven’t played yet. So, honestly, we are just trying to grow as a team and continue to improve.”

You never get a second chance to make a first impression, and that's exactly why Deanna Fisher is passionate about making the Cedar Lee Mini-Park a place that makes visitors and residents fall in love at first sight with Cleveland Heights.


   

  "So many people who visit the Cedar Lee District walk through this space, and it's often the first experience people have of Cleveland Heights," says the FutureHeights executive director of the public space between Cedar-Lee Theatre and Boss Dog Brewing Company. "We felt it should really be a much more welcoming and attractive experience than what was currently there."


   

  Enter plans for the Cedar Lee Mini-Park placemaking project, which seeks to transform the space from an unremarkable pass-thru to a vibrant community hub. With an estimated cost of $440,000, the plans include a raised performance stage, pollinator garden, three-tiered drinking fountain, new trees, and bike racks to supplement the gathering areas already in place.


   

  "This is an area of Cleveland Heights that is very urban, so there is a need for a place where people can connect with nature," says Fisher. "[The mini- park] will function as a public park for Cleveland Heights residents and visitors."


   

  This effort has been in motion since 2017, when a group of residents came together to form Friends of Cedar Lee Mini-Park and reinvigorate the city- owned site in tandem with FutureHeights. According to Fisher, the city had acquired the site in the 1960s after it closed Cedarbrook Road to install parking for the Cedar-Lee district, after which the adjacent space became a pedestrian pass-thru from the parking area to Lee Road.


   

  In 2018, FutureHeights mounted a public placemaking and planning process-- informed by visioning sessions, workshops, online surveys, and interviews with the surrounding community. Since then, the project has been through several design iterations with Columbus-based MKSK.


   

  "Cedar-Lee completed its streetscape in 2017, but this space was not touched by that [Special Improvement District project]," says Fisher. "This area has always been an afterthought, and the park was tired and forlorn-looking. It has been so long since anyone put any thought into the design."


   

  That's all about to change, as Fisher says they are close to landing on the final concept and just launched the final survey for community input. FutureHeights hopes to begin construction this fall (or by spring 2021 at latest) with a phased rollout to accommodate the need for further fundraising; so far, they've raised $80,000 of the necessary $440,000 to bring the project to fruition.


   

  Fisher says she is buoyed by the possibilities and new opportunities to bring more public art and programming into Cleveland Heights. "Cleveland Heights is home to the arts, with more artists per capita than any other city in Cuyahoga County," says Fisher. "This is a space where we can really celebrate that and create an opportunity for the character of Cleveland Heights to come out."

Sally was a rare storm that could make history, said Ed Rappaport, deputy director of the National Hurricane Center.


  “Sally has a characteristic that isn’t often seen and that’s a slow forward speed and that’s going to exacerbate the flooding,” Rappaport told The Associated Press.


  He likened the storm’s slow progression to that of Hurricane Harvey, which swamped Houston in 2017. Up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rain could fall in some spots, and “that would be record-setting in some locations,” Rappaport said in an interview Tuesday night.


  Although the hurricane had the Alabama and Florida coasts in its sights Wednesday, its effects were felt all along the northern Gulf Coast. Low lying properties in southeast Louisiana were swamped by the surge. Water covered Mississippi beaches and parts of the highway that runs parallel to them. Two large casino boats broke loose from a dock where they were undergoing construction work in Alabama.


  Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves urged people in the southern part of his state to prepare for the potential for flash flooding.


  After dumping rain on the coast Wednesday, Sally was forecast to bring heavy downpours to parts of Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and the Carolinas later in the week.


  Sally’s power was an irresistible draw for some in its path.


  With heavy rains pelting Navarre Beach, Fla., and the wind-whipped surf pounding, a steady stream of people walked down the wooden boardwalk at a park for a look at the scene Tuesday afternoon.


  Rebecca Studstill, who lives inland, was wary of staying too long, noting that police close bridges once the wind and water get too high. With Hurricane Sally expected to dump rain for days, the problem could be worse than normal, she said.


  “Just hunkering down would probably be the best thing for folks out here,” she said.

Turns out, they did none of that consistently, and the blame for this finally has to fall on, yeah, Doc Rivers. He’s the one constant in all their recent collapses. Throughout Tuesday’s second half, as with those other collapses, they again looked unprepared and out of sorts.
 When the pressure rose, the Clippers wilted. They stopped taking good shots. They stopped playing good defense. The Nuggets were focused, the Clippers were lost.
 “I’m the coach, and I’ll take the blame for it,” Rivers said afterward. “I mean, listen, obviously I could have done something more. I always think it’s me no matter what.”
 It was also others, notably two others. Leonard and George went a combined 10-for-38. Both were scoreless in a fourth quarter during which the Clippers made six baskets. Their trademark defense lapsed and allowed the Nuggets, particularly young stars Jamal Murray and Nikola Jokic, to run the court at will.

All students are supposed to connect with teachers and classmates online in a three-day orientation starting Wednesday that will focus on students' social and emotional well-being and lay out some of the practicalities of how this unprecedented school year will work.
 Meanwhile, behind the scenes, teachers and administrators are still working furiously to prepare for the physical return of students to classrooms. And there is still sparring going on between city officials and unions over safety precautions and staffing levels.
 Mark Cannizzaro, the president of the Council of School Supervisors and Administrators, which represents principals, said the mayor’s promise to send 2,000 additional teachers into the system to fill gaps created by social distancing requirements still leaves the district “woefully” short-staffed. He says city principals asked for more than 10,000 new teachers.
 Michael Mulgrew, president of the United Federation of Teachers, questioned both staffing levels and coronavirus safety.
 “Right now we still don’t have a teacher for every classroom for students who come in,” Mulgrew said Tuesday on TV station NY1. “We still don’t know if all the schools are being cleaned and disinfected on a daily basis because custodians have not been given all the proper equipment to do those things.”
 Some teachers protested outside their schools on Monday. “Now that school staff are back in school buildings, it is clearer than ever that the mayor’s reopening plan is not safe,” the Movement of Rank and File Educators, a militant UFT caucus, said in a statement.
 De Blasio has waved off the union complaints. “We’ve been talking about it for weeks and weeks,” he said at his coronavirus briefing on Tuesday. “School is opening on Monday the 21st.”
 The city plans to do random testing of students and staff for the virus starting on Oct. 1. The mayor said Monday that a COVID-19 “situation room” would be set up to respond swiftly to school coronavirus cases.

Playing for the first time in 364 days, the 38-year-old completed 21 of 32 passes for 229 yards and three touchdowns. And while he only truly let it loose a couple of times, he was efficient. He was patient. He was even a little spry, running for an 11-yard gain at one point.
 While Roethlisberger wasn't dominant, dominance wasn't required. Not on a night where the defense produced three sacks and two turnovers while holding New York running back Saquon Barkley to just 6 yards rushing. For a team that expects to compete with Baltimore for the AFC North title, it was a promising start. Even if it was just a start.
 "We said afterward it wasn't perfect, it wasn't even good some of the time offensively," Roethlisberger said. "But at the end of the day we found a way to win."
 A win that came with plenty of what coach Mike Tomlin likes to call "meat on the bone," meaning there is plenty to work on ahead of a visit by Denver on Sunday. That work, however, will not include any uncertainty about Roethlisberger's status. He's back. And so might be an offense that scored three touchdowns in a game just three times during his extended absence in 2019.
 "Ben told us we can be great individuals," wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster said, "But if we work all together and we're good, we can be great as a team."
 WHAT'S WORKING
 Outside linebackers T.J. Watt and Bud Dupree picked up right where they left off in 2019, as one of the best edge rush tandems in the NFL. Watt grabbed his fourth career interception in addition to a tackle for loss and two hits on New York quarterback Daniel Jones. Dupree, who is in a contract year after the Steelers placed the franchise tag on him, turned the game in Pittsburgh's favor for good when he pressured Jones into a floater that ended up in the arms of Steelers defensive tackle Cam Heyward and ended a 19-play New York drive.
 "Bud is a dangerous guy, as is T.J.," Tomlin said. "When you have an outside linebacker tandem like that in the 3-4 defense, you have an opportunity to play great defense and we are cognizant of the contributions of those two men and appreciative of it and that is why were are excited about the group that we have."
 WHAT NEEDS HELP
 Perhaps no group was affected more by the lack of preseason games than special teams, due to the difficulty in replicating game-like situations during practice. Still, Tomlin wasn't searching for excuses after Diontae Johnson fumbled a punt and kicker Chris Boswell sent a kickoff out of bounds to give the Giants solid field position.

EAU CLAIRE — The Eau Claire County Board during its meeting Tuesday night postponed an amendment to a resolution authorizing the county to conduct a forensic audit into the county Department of Human Services.
 After about two hours of discussion, input from the Eau Claire County Sheriff’s Office and multiple amendments to the initial resolution, the County Board voted to postpone the amendment until its Oct. 6 meeting in order to have time to verify where the money for actions in the amendment would come from. The amendment, which was postponed by a 19-10 vote, proposes spending up to $75,000 to conduct a program audit of DHS and up to $25,000 “to hire forensic experts to pursue the full scope” of alleged credit card theft related to an ongoing criminal case against a former DHS employee.
 Supervisor Kevin Stelljes drafted the amendment to allow the Sheriff’s Office to pursue and investigate potential criminal activities and conduct a thorough program audit of DHS. The alleged credit card theft refers to a case against former DHS employee Zer Smith, who was charged last month with nine counts of fraud relating to credit card purchases at DHS between November 2018 and August 2019. A court hearing in that case is scheduled for Nov. 10. If approved, the Sheriff’s Office investigation would “include heretofore unreported thefts or other persons involved,” according to the amendment.
 According to Stelljes’s amendment, a DHS program audit would focus on three areas: evaluation of DHS management controls and improvement recommendations; evaluation of accounting and forecasting practices; and evaluation of program effectiveness to determine how successful DHS is in delivering services.
 The County Board also approved an amendment to Stelljes’s amendment noting that if either the $25,000 forensic examination or $75,000 program audit go over budget, they would be referred to the Administration Committee and Finance and Budget Committee.
 A program audit is different from a forensic audit. A program audit looks at an organization to determine if the organization is meeting its performance goals. A forensic audit analyzes an organization’s financial records specifically to search for illegal activity.
 Supervisor Steve Chilson, co-author of a resolution that would authorize the county to spend up to $100,000 to conduct a forensic audit of DHS, said community confidence in DHS is low and a forensic audit would help restore that confidence. Indeed, the County Board received 30 public comments Tuesday night supporting a forensic audit of DHS.
 “We owe it to the taxpayers to do everything we can to find out everything we can and take corrective action,” Chilson said.
 The Eau Claire County sheriff, district attorney and treasurer support the resolution. Chilson urged supervisors to listen to those law enforcement and financial experts and move forward with a forensic audit.
 Supervisor Mark Beckfield, the resolution’s other co-author, said the total amount of money potentially unaccounted for in the Smith case is at least five figures, since the criminal complaint against Smith states that she purchased 43 prepaid gift cards each worth $500. DHS records only show receipt or approval of 17 gift cards, leaving at least $13,000 unannounced for. That unaccounted for money should be enough to justify a forensic audit, according to Beckfield.
 “This is not small potatoes that we’re talking about,” Beckfield said.
 Supervisor Carl Anton said the County Board owes clarification to DHS employees regarding the financial situation of the department, and that clarity cannot happen without a forensic audit.
 “We need to get to the bottom of it for the sake of our employees,” Anton said.
 Supervisor Robin Leary agreed.
 “If we don’t do this, we’re not going to know, and it’s going to continue to be a question,” Leary said. “While I don’t like having to do this, I think it’s necessary.”
 Several supervisors voiced opposition to Stelljes’s amendment. Supervisor Judy Gatlin said more discussion should occur about the services DHS provides and the “perfect storm” of challenges the department has faced in recent years, including substance abuse, mental health challenges and now the COVID-19 pandemic.
 “How can you put metrics on saving people?” Gatlin said.
 Supervisor Don Mowry spoke against the amendment, saying there is no known criminal activity in DHS besides Smith’s case.
 “Why are we doing this?” Mowry said. “Where’s the evidence that there’s more wrongdoing in the department?”
 In order to make a comment regarding the resolution, County Board Chair Nick Smiar stepped down from the chair position while the resolution was discussed, and Supervisor Colleen Bates, the County Board vice chair, took over as chair.
 Smiar spoke against the resolution, saying the ”entire matter has the appearance of a whisper campaign with the sole purpose of damaging, intimidating, and bullying both DHS and this board.”
 Later in the meeting, Smiar asked Joel Brettingen, Eau Claire County undersheriff and captain of field services, what evidence the Sheriff’s Office has to support a forensic audit. The Sheriff’s Office opened a fact-finding inquiry May 29 into DHS financial practices, and the inquiry remains open. Declining to go into specifics about the ongoing inquiry, Brettingen said the Sheriff’s Office knows of several “irregularities” and “anomalies” in DHS that cannot be answered without a forensic audit.
 Other supervisors expressed ambivalence. Supervisor Heather DeLuka said she is not against a forensic audit but said supervisors don’t have enough information to determine if a forensic audit is warranted.
 Supervisor Katherine Schneider asked County Administrator Kathryn Schauf if she thinks a forensic audit is necessary. Schauf said more information is required before she can respond one way or the other.
 “It’s hard to say yes or no,” Schauf said. “I know that’s a non-answer, but it’s the best I can give for now.”
 Schauf also said a program audit of DHS “may have value.”
 The next County Board meeting is scheduled for Oct. 6.

Rivers didn’t single George and Leonard out for blame. “Game 7s are a make- miss game at the end of the day. I don’t think it was those two,” he said. “I think as a group. It wasn’t just those two. If you look at our shot quality it was pretty dang good, but the ball didn’t go in, and on those nights you hoped that you could lean on your defense and I just didn’t think, even though numbers say we were a good defensive team, I just didn’t think we ever realized that part of our game at all.”


  The Nuggets had a lot to do with that as they became the only NBA team to recover from a 3-1 series deficit twice in one postseason. “We found a way to be a really good team three times,” coach Michael Malone said.


  In this series, that was more than enough to beat the Clippers. “We did have championship expectations and we had the talent to do it. I don’t think we had the chemistry to do it and it showed,” Lou Williams said.


  “We had lapses on defense and on offense … it showed. But at the end of the day, we were up 3-1. We had two opportunities to win games, we were up 20 points. We should have closed this deal out and we didn’t, so you give credit to Denver for continuing to play and we take our lumps and we keep moving.”

Across the board, from independent owners to multi-unit franchise operators, restaurants are losing money every month, and they continue to struggle to serve their communities and support their employees."

Gothenburg volleyball coach Bryson Mahlberg called a timeout about midway through the opening game of his team’s matchup with St. Pat’s.


  It was a move to help his players regain some composure after he watched the Swedes make a series of mental and physical errors that gave the Irish the lead and momentum early in the match.


  “I think we were just all over the place,” Mahlberg said. “We weren’t passing well and we weren’t hitting well and that just translates.


  “I think in the 15 (points that St. Pat’s had), we committed about eight errors,” Mahlberg said. “But I was happy with how we responded (after the time out) and I thought we played cleaner and more focused over the next two sets.”


  The Swedes looked different after the break and rallied to take 14 of the final 17 points of the opening game and carried that confidence on through the rest of the matchup.

En estos tiempos es una necesidad imperiosa revivir la esperanza en nuestra nación, si partimos del hecho cierto de que estamos viviendo momentos difíciles por inseguridad y de múltiples incertidumbres que han afectado de manera asombrosas el diario vivir de la mayoría de dominicanos.
 Revivir la esperanza en nuestro país implica el reto a trabajar seria y asiduamente en el presente, ahora que todavía podemos, corrigiendo los entuertos y las verdaderas causas que han provocado todas las pifias que lamentablemente hemos cometido a lo largo de muchos años
 Revivir la esperanza implica un llamado serio a las presentes generaciones de hombres y de mujeres, sobre todo, a los jóvenes del presente, para que empecemos a trabajar desde ya en las correcciones de las causas fundamentales que han originado tantos males económicos, políticos y sociales en nuestra nación, con la finalidad expresa de ir creando las bases fundamentes de un mejor futuro,
 Es como han planteado algunos teóricos de la materia, de lo que se trata es de rehacer la cultura de la esperanza, reconstruirla, cultivarla, relanzarla, asumiendo con dignidad y responsabilidad todos los roles que nos toquen jugar y los roles que nos impongan las necesidades fundamentales de los sectores más empobrecidos y necesitados de nuestra sociedad, pues de lo contrario los niños de hoy no tendrían un futuro seguro.
 Para nadie es un secreto que la clase política en nuestro país no ha obrado de buena manera, ha tenido grandes desaciertos y ha sido, quiérase o no, la culpable y la causante del crecimiento vertiginoso de la mayoría de nuestros problemas y males sociales que hoy por hoy nos agobian.
 Nuestra clase política ha sido demagógica, históricamente, ya que desde la oposición le ha vendido falsas esperanzas, muchas promesas y muchos sueños a los hombres y mujeres de nuestra nación, cosas que son olvidada inmediatamente han llegado al Palacio Nacional.
 Claro está, la esperanza de muchos dominicanos se ha ido perdiendo debido a que la tónica de nuestra clase política ha sido la corrupción administrativa, el enriquecimiento ilícito y el robo del erario, lo que se ha convertido en malos ejemplos para las generaciones de jóvenes.
 Para revivir la esperanza es necesario crear la necesaria confianza y corresponde al PRM y Luis Abinader obrar con pulcritud y con decisión si queremos revivir esa esperanza.

“Sally has a characteristic that isn’t often seen and that’s a slow forward speed and that’s going to exacerbate the flooding,” Rappaport told The Associated Press.
 He likened the storm's slow progression to that of Hurricane Harvey, which swamped Houston in 2017. Up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rain could fall in some spots, and “that would be record-setting in some locations,” Rappaport said in an interview Tuesday night.
 Although the hurricane had the Alabama and Florida coasts in its sights Wednesday, its effects were felt all along the northern Gulf Coast. Low lying properties in southeast Louisiana were swamped by the surge. Water covered Mississippi beaches and parts of the highway that runs parallel to them. Two large casino boats broke loose from a dock where they were undergoing construction work in Alabama.
 Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves urged people in the southern part of his state to prepare for the potential for flash flooding.
 After dumping rain on the coast Wednesday, Sally was forecast to bring heavy downpours to parts of Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and the Carolinas later in the week.
 Sally's power was an irresistible draw for some in its path.

PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) — A newly strengthened Hurricane Sally pummeled the Florida Panhandle and south Alabama with sideways rain, beach-covering storm surges, strong winds and power outages early Wednesday, moving toward shore at an agonizingly slow pace that promised a drawn out drenching and possible record floods.
 Some 150,000 homes and businesses had lost electricity by early Wednesday, according to the poweroutage.us site. A curfew was called in the coastal Alabama city of Gulf Shores due to life-threatening conditions. In the Panhandle's Escambia County, Chief Sheriff's Deputy Chip Simmons vowed to keep deputies out with residents as long as physically possible. The county includes Pensacola, one of the largest cities on the Gulf Coast.
 “The sheriff’s office will be there until we can no longer safely be out there, and then and only then will we pull our deputies in,” Simmons said at a storm briefing late Tuesday.
 This for a storm that, during the weekend, appeared to be headed for New Orleans. “Obviously this shows what we’ve known for a long time with storms – they are unpredictable,” Pensacola Mayor Grover Robinson IV said.
 Sally rapidly strengthened as it approached land, quickly rising into a Category 2 storm, packing 100 mph (160 kph) winds. It was 65 miles south- southeast of Mobile, Alabama, and moving north-northeast at 2 mph (4 kph). Landfall was expected on the northern Gulf Coast early Wednesday. A National Hurricane Center forecast map showed a possible landfall between Alabama's Mobile Bay and the Panhandle.
 Sally was a rare storm that could make history, said Ed Rappaport, deputy director of the National Hurricane Center.

With Hurricane Sally expected to dump rain for days, the problem could be worse than normal, she said.“Just hunkering down would probably be the best thing for folks out here,” she said.___Wang reported from Mobile, Alabama and Martin, from Marietta, Georgia.

Instead, Dani continued to stick with The Committee and put Kevin and David on the block. Another week of nominations and The Committee running the show. In a beautiful bit of karma though, there's no real safe choice this week because not only is there a secret power out there for David to use, but a new veto winner is about to make a move.
