Of McCaffrey’s three interceptions, only a deep shot to Falck late in the first half was especially frustrating and off the mark. The first — coming on an early fourth-and-4 when McCaffrey took a bad snap high and to the right and had to improvise — actually saved Nebraska 7 yards of field position than if the Illinois defender had just batted the ball down. Another also came on fourth down late in the third quarter with the Huskers trailing by 21.
 Frost said McCaffrey’s game-opening fumble was “not a good decision to do what he did” and that he doesn’t want any Nebraska quarterback running as often as it occurred Saturday. The performance looks worse, he said, when erratic snaps and missed protections factor in.

In bringing a Christmas musical to Netflix, a streaming community that reaches practically 200 million subscribers throughout the world, Parton’s cannily common model goes into holly jolly overdrive. “Dolly Parton’s Christmas on the Square” — which, sure, is the movie’s full Christian title — brings collectively a consciously inclusive solid to sing with aggressive sincerity about the joys of Christmas, hope and religion. Directed and choreographed by Debbie Allen, dancing comes as naturally to those characters as respiration, and even when Parton’s songs begin to mix collectively, they get a lift from the likes of Jeanine Mason and Jenifer Lewis belting them. The cheery city sq., with its trinket retailers and can-do spirit, instantly places the likes of Stars Hole to disgrace. And whereas most Christmas motion pictures in Netflix’s ever-ballooning sub-genre are likely to have a good time the vacation as a typically nice household custom, Parton’s model is explicitly Christian to the level that certainly one of the movie’s most important characters is the native pastor whose title is, I child you not, Christian.

 These developments assume significance against the backdrop of Pfizer seeking emergency use authorisation of its COVID-19 vaccine from the US regulators. Another U.S.-based biotechnology giant, Moderna, said it also intended to apply for an emergency use authorisation (EUA) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) in the coming weeks.
 According to the source, an urgent meeting of the vaccine task force (VTF) with experts will be convened to review the scientific status of vaccines globally and how and when should the decision on emergency authorisation of vaccines be taken.
 ## Terms of references
 The terms of references for two major bodies dealing with vaccine introduction — the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) and the Central Drug Standards and Control Organisation (CDSCO) — will be set and their roles clearly defined for authorisation and emergency authorisation.
 It was also agreed at the meeting that one point of contact would be responsible for examining and responding to authorisations given (or in the pipeline), globally, the source said.

Martinez accounted for more than 400 yards of offense last season in Nebraska’s 42-38 win over Illinois. Frost said if coaches thought Martinez gave the Huskers the best chance to win, he would have been on the field more.
 The problem isn’t a lack of understanding of the offense, Allen said, considering NU locks them into a certain number of plays each week. It’s about executing those assignments and giving quarterbacks a little extra time to make their reads. Frost said he will continue to simplify the offense as needed “to make sure these young players can be in the right place and do the right thing.”

The film’s very busy, and never simply due to the typically frantic dancing; Maria S. Schlatter’s script is sickly candy and, in a 20 minute stretch of essential twists and turns, genuinely weird. However when it comes all the way down to it, critiquing one thing like “Dolly Parton’s Christmas on the Square” is nearly unattainable — which is precisely as Parton would have it. This can be a film designed inside an inch of its life to appease everybody who would possibly come throughout it, and in case you don’t prefer it, effectively, regardless of. A merry Christmas to you and yours from Dolly Parton, in all her all-encompassing benevolence, anyway.

  # Inequality ‘baked into’ virus testing access as cases surge


  Christine Fernando and Carolyn Thompson


  Associated Press


  View Comments


  The day after Amanda Serulneck found out she might have been exposed to COVID-19, she visited a rapid testing center in New Jersey, but was turned away because they ran out of tests.


  She returned at 7 a.m. the next day. After waiting for an hour, officials said they had run out again. On her third try, Serulneck and her friend called several testing centers before driving for an hour to one with availability.


  Lines for free COVID-19 tests stretch for blocks and hours in cities where people feel the dual strain of the coronavirus surge and the approaching holidays. But an increasing number of pop-up clinics promise visitors instant results — at a cost. Some charge $150 or more for a spot at the front of the queue.


  While her friend who lacked insurance had to pay $125 for the test, Serulneck’s price was only $35. The real cost came from the two days she had to take off from work, she said.


  “People are just trying to get by, and they can’t be taking off work for a week to wait for results,” said Serulneck, who works at a spa. “People need rapid testing to be available and affordable.”


  Dr. Mark Shrime said his work gave him the flexibility to wait in line six hours for a test in New York City last week, but he knows not everyone can do the same.


  “If I’m an hourly worker, I can’t take off six hours just so I can get a test so I can go back to work,” said Shrime, who needed a test to avoid a 14-day quarantine after traveling from Boston. “Another option was another place 10 blocks away from me where I could pay 250 bucks to get a rapid test, so the structure that we set up for people to be able to keep themselves safe from COVID baked into those structures is an inequity.”


  Serulneck says it’s been frustrating to watch people do rapid tests so that they can go to parties or travel for the holidays.


  “Some people who need rapid testing to work can’t afford it,” she said. “It’s not fair. The majority of people are in my position.”


  As numbers of infections cases climb in the United States and the country faces what health experts say will be a dark winter due to the uncontrolled spread of the virus, the demand for testing becomes greater. The U.S. has had more than 12 million reported cases and more than 255,000 deaths from the coronavirus since the start of the pandemic.


  Social worker Chelsea Collins said she had to pay $150 for a test at a drug store after she lost her insurance due to the pandemic. After her husband, a union painter, learned he may have been exposed to COVID-19 last week, she was faced with finding a way to get tested again.


  After visiting a free drive-thru testing site at 5:30 a.m. in Scranton, Pennsylvania, on Saturday and waiting about 1½-2 hours for a test, the 32-year-old Collins said she considers herself lucky. But she thought about those people without the means to get to a testing site not served by public transit.


  “I feel for a lot of people with families, at the holidays and having to shell out $150 because they’re exposed,” Collins said.


  Dan Fulwiler, president and CEO of Esperanza Health Centers in southwest Chicago, said costly rapid testing centers won’t help the communities that his nonprofit serves. About 70% of the center’s clients live in poverty, according to his estimate.


  Fulwiler laments the lack of a national testing strategy that’s led to the proliferation of pop-up clinics. Daily demand also has risen at Esperanza from up to 150 in the summer to 400 now.

This latter level would possibly come as a shock for individuals who will flip on “Christmas on the Square” in the hopes of a brand new camp basic starring Parton as a guardian angel reverse a slowly melting Scrooge, performed by none apart from Christine Baranski.

 By the time Brian Burns got his final sack Sunday in the fourth quarter of Carolina's shocking 20-0 shutout of Detroit, he was, as he would put it later, "tired as hell."
 Fortunately for Burns, by then the Panthers had completely flummoxed Detroit with an inventive scheme and huge plays by a number of different defenders.
 Said Burns: "They had no idea where we were coming from. ... We were sending guys from all over the place and they messed up their protection. A lot."
 The Lions and quarterback Matthew Stafford kept getting fooled, as the Panthers lined up as if they were going to blitz on nearly every passing down and then often bailed out at the last minute.
 Burns, meanwhile, was lining up all across the defensive line and sometimes at linebacker, too. Determined to stop No. 53, the Lions wanted to devote two blockers to him as often as they could, but were often unable to find him.

  # Tennessee House GOP relocates meeting because of Nashville mayor's limit on gathering size


  Natalie Allison


  Nashville Tennessean


  View Comments


  In light of a new Nashville order restricting gatherings, Tennessee's House Republican Caucus has been forced to relocate a Tuesday meeting from a downtown hotel.


  They're moving a few blocks away to the safety of state property – the House chamber at the Capitol – where the group will be exempt from Nashville Mayor John Cooper's order restricting gatherings to no more than eight people.


  The 73-member House Republican Caucus was scheduled to hold its caucus leadership election Tuesday afternoon at Homewood Suites, where the group had rented a ballroom for the meeting.


  Ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday and with worsening coronavirus metrics, Cooper last week announced the new restrictions on social gatherings would take effect Monday.


  "It's completely asinine," House GOP Caucus Chairman Jeremy Faison said. "I think the First Amendment is very clear that you can't deny people their right to assemble."


  Faison, of Cosby, is facing Rep. Robin Smith, R-Hixson, in his re-election bid for caucus chairman. Other races, including House speaker and majority leader, are uncontested.


  The House Republicans late last week gathered at Pickwick Landing State Park in Hardin County for a multi-day retreat. About 50 members attended, along with Gov. Bill Lee, Health Commissioner Lisa Piercey and other top state officials.


  Senate Republicans met in the Cordell Hull legislative office building on Thursday to eat lunch and hold their own leadership elections.


  Cooper issued his order as the spread of coronavirus trends upward both in Nashville and across the state.


  Faison said he could understand Cooper urging people not to gather – a method employed by Lee, but one that has not proved effective in slowing the spread of coronavirus. But Faison argued Cooper has "no legal or constitutional authority" to prevent people from gathering.


  Cooper's office did not immediately return a request for comment.


  The governor, however, alsohas issued restrictions on gatherings because of the pandemic.


  In March, Lee through Executive Order 17 limited social gatherings to no more than 10 people, a number that later increased to 50 before being lifted altogether in late September.
