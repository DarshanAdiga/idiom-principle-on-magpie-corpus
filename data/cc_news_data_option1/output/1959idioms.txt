 The airline industry has been one of the hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. Air travel dropped by more than 95 percent as the coronavirus spread across the U.S., effectively grounding what had been for several years, a travel boom.
 Delta, American and United Airlines reported major first-quarter losses, and expect even worse financial news for the second quarter. Delta CEO Ed Bastian said it could take two to three years for business to recover.
 Now as states across the country begin to gradually lift stay-at-home orders and businesses begin to reopen, airlines are instituting major changes to get passengers back on board and show it's safe to travel by plane.
 Some of these new safety measures include intensified aircraft cleanings using electrostatic sprayers, new boarding procedures, fewer passengers per flight and new seating plans to promote social distancing. All major airlines and many airports are now requiring passengers to wear face coverings and last week, McCarran International Airport became the first to introduce vending machines selling PPE such as masks, gloves, hand sanitizer and disinfecting wipes. Temperature checks for passengers before boarding and immunity passports are also being considered.

The response to two Delhi High Court directions — asking the Administrator to file a status report on the sale of assets and whether the government intends to infuse funds — in a case pertaining to the scam-hit Punjab & Maharashtra Co-operative (PMC) Bank is likely to give a fair idea to its beleaguered depositors about the fate of their deposits.
 The Bank’s depositors, especially senior citizens, who have been running from pillar to post to get back their deposits, have taken legal recourse so that they can at least withdraw the interest earned on their deposits.
 They said this will help them at least make a living/ subsist during the ongoing pandemic when the prices of essential commodities have gone up.
 In the Sandeep Bhalla & others (petitioners) vs Reserve Bank of India (RBI) & others (respondents) case, the Delhi HC directed PMC Bank’s Administrator to file a status report indicating whether or not the sale of assets of the promoter-directors of Housing Development and Infrastructure Ltd (HDIL) has taken place.
 In case the sale of assets has taken place, the status report will, inter alia, indicate the amount that has been garnered and the assets sold. HDIL is involved in the the alleged fraud of ₹4,355 crore in the Bank. Furthermore, the court wants the status report to give the details of the assets which have not been sold, along with their market value and the realizable value. It also needs to indicate the steps taken for the sale of these assets.
 The Court asked the Union of India (UOI), Ministry of Finance, to file an affidavit indicating whether it intends to infuse funds to render support to the bank.
 The Court said this direction has been issued in the context of an argument raised by the petitioner no 1 (Sandeep Bhalla) that, recently, the UOI had infused funds in Yes Bank, a private bank.
 Eight financial institutions led by government-owned State Bank of India collectively infused ₹10,000 crore in a dramatic rescue of Yes Bank in March this year.
 Referring to the withdrawal being capped at ₹50,000 of the total balance in their accounts for nine months up to June 22, 2020, Delhi HC Advocate Vivek Dixit opined that this cap needs to go up as the deposit insurance cover has gone up five times to ₹5 lakh.
 Drawing attention to a recent RBI circular that enhanced the maximum withdrawal limit for medical expenses for critical life-threatening ailments to ₹5 lakh (from ₹1 lakh), Dixit emphasised that it only deals with life- threatening ailments. There are many senior citizens who are struggling with non-critical ailments, whose cost of treatment is also very high.
 According to a RBI statement, PMC Bank was placed under directions with effect from the close of business on September 23, 2019, on account of major financial irregularities, failure of internal control and systems of the bank and wrong/under-reporting of its exposures.

The teachers and administration at each school nominated the student who best represented the Optimist Creed, and shared their basis behind their recommendations, which went out with the announcement.
 Of Pupanek, Jefferson Middle School principal Nick Skretta said that the eighth-grader demonstrates model school citizenship. Skretta described Pupanek as a team player who is compassionate, genuine, personable, and resilient.
 "Joey has overcome incredible obstacles in his life, and he has never let that get him down," Skretta said.
 Of Hunt, Sullivan Elementary School principal Nikki Krause said he is a great student and friend, in and out of the classroom, and always puts others ahead of himself.
 He leads by example, and when he talks others listen. His kind, caring attitude puts young Sullivan Stingers at ease, and fellow students learn from his constructive criticism, feedback and encouragement.
 Academically, the principal said, Hunt has shown incredible growth over the past couple of years, and he always puts forth his best effort.
 Of Luebbe, East principal Jake Wichman said that the fifth-grade team agreed she is a model of self-motivation, effort and citizenship.
 "While she strives to produce the best in her own work, she takes time to help others in need as well," Wichman said. "She recognizes the achievements and struggles of others as a quiet leader. She remains positive and encouraging in the face of adversity."
 He said Luebbe goes above and beyond expectations in and out of the classroom and has persevered through the transition to online learning.
 Steve Dinkel, Jefferson High School principal, called Diaz a "tremendous example of the Optimist Creed," noting that she is willing to stand up for what's right. In addition, she is not afraid to stand out, to take action and to work for the best outcome for everyone.
 A member of the top 10 percent of the senior class, Diaz belongs to the National Honor Society, is a member of Best Buddies, the Chess Club, the Coding Club, Dollars 4 Collars benefiting the Humane Society of Jefferson County, Latino Club, the Model United Nations Club, Rotary Interact and Student Council.
 She has taken multiple Advanced Placement classes and serves as a role model for her peers, the principal said.
 St. John's Lutheran principal Peter Lemke described his school's honoree, Draeger, as hard-working, responsible, generous and funny.
 "Alyssa's attitude is never self-centered or self-promoting," he said. "She loves her friends; she loves her Savior, and she respects authority.
 "In times of frustration or anger, she keeps a calm demeanor and a level head," he said, noting that she serves as a role model for others.
 Of Dehnert, St. John the Baptist principal Bill Bare said the Catholic school honoree shows unwavering optimism.
 She has been the eighth-grade class vice president, leading with enthusiasm, and has been willing to go the extra mile for her classmates and school, Bare said.
 "Ella is a positive role model for our younger students as she speaks and acts with respect and encouragement," he said.
 Of Probst, St. Peter's principal Craig Winkler noted that the name Kayden means "a kind companion or friend," and Probst lives up to that.
 "He is the quiet leader in our multi-age room who always lends a hand to help others," Winkler said. "He gladly partners with younger students... He cheers on everyone during recess and physical education games."
 The principal added that he can always count on Probst to ask thoughtful questions and set a modest example, encouraging all to be their best, simply and humbly.
 Probst is part of the school's Forensics Club, sings with the choir, writes silly poems that make people laugh, and inspires others with his creativity in art class. Overall, he just shows outstanding Christian character, Winkler said.
 Usually schools are limited to choosing one recipient of the Optimist award, but in the case of West, twins Sofia and Savanah Frohmader were equally qualified for the award.
 "They are the sweetest girls with great personalities," West principal Mike Howard said. "The girls fully represent what it means to be optimistic. They smile and laugh often. They treat their peers with respect and are tremendous role models."
 Howard noted that staff members enjoy all of their interactions with the girls. While they will truly be missed at West, Howard said he expects great things of the Frohmaders as they move on to Jefferson Middle School.

“Our conceptual plan is designed around connection,” Roberts said.
 Roberts said the trail would also run along Waco Creek and the Hart-Patterson Track and Field Complex, as well as connect to the city’s future plans for Mary Avenue.
 “The conceptual plans also lay the groundwork for those trails to make future off-site connections to 29th Street, to the South Waco Rec Center and up 32nd Street to the Mary Avenue trail,” Roberts said. “It could have potential linkages long-term to the Mary Avenue pedestrian bridge and the East Waco riverwalk.”
 The development would also include space for offices along Dutton Avenue. Community facilities and gathering spaces would fill the 7.31 acres of the site located in the city of Beverly Hills. The proposal also includes space for an inclusive park near the track and field complex, something parks and recreation officials brought up as a priority last year. Roberts said the park would be similar to the Play for All Park in Round Rock.

“Throughout your career, (in) any professional sport, you’re going to go through some type of adversity. And what gets through that type of adversity is a mindset,” Ward said. “I’ve been through a lot, but everybody has been through a lot if you really think about it.”
 Ward last year appeared in 16 straight contests, including the playoffs, for the first time since playing in every game in his second season in 2015. He missed the first three weeks of the regular season last year with a broken hand in August months after fracturing his collarbone during June OTAs.
 Still, Ward put together the best year of his career with a crucial role on the NFL’s top-ranked pass defense. The 49ers allowed just 169 passing yards per game, the fewest since the New York Jets allowed 154 in 2009.
 “I know the guys, I have relationships with them, so that’s one reason I wanted to stay,” Ward said. “The Niners, they came out with a decent amount of money that I felt comfortable with and so I just decided to stay.”
 Ward returned to the 49ers on a three-year, $28.5 million contract that included $13.5 million in guarantees at signing. His $9.5 million average salary is the 13th-highest among NFL safeties. His overall Pro Football Focus grade was sixth among safeties who played half their team’s snaps.
 Ward, along with defensive lineman Arik Armstead, is one of the returning free agents on defense San Francisco prioritized after trading DeForest Buckner to the Colts.
 ESPN reported Ward turned down more money from the Las Vegas Raiders to stick with the defending NFC champions, though Ward would not confirm which other teams were in the running for his services.
 “When it comes to the business side, you never know what will happen and I knew there would be other teams that had more money than the 49ers,” he said.

 The recipe says blueberry, but don’t stop there. You may insert any other berry, chopped peaches, diced apples (add a touch of cinnamon to the batter in that case), or well-drained crushed pineapple into the batter.

Now essential workers, including grocery clerks and nurses, have until Wednesday to apply for three months of subsidized child care unless they qualify for other reasons. Those who are receiving subsidies can expect to finish out three months.
 “Many essential workers who had kids in school hadn’t planned or budgeted for child care for those months as those kids were already in school,” said Reagan Miller, Texas Workforce Commission’s director of child care. “Child care was only authorized for each child for three months while they made arrangements for their longer-term needs.”
 TWC had also decided in April to waive the required payment for low-income parents receiving state subsidies for child care, acknowledging that many were facing financial hardship. Those parents must now pay their share of child care costs starting June 1.
 The commission is also considering reinstating the work requirement for families receiving subsidized child care, depending on how unemployment changes as businesses reopen.
 Abbott decided to reopen the economy as the number of coronavirus cases steadily increases and test numbers fall short of the state’s own recommendations.
 Advocates have warned that child care centers, already on shaky financial ground, will struggle to get back up and running while trying to meet stringent safety requirements. Already, 37% of licensed child care centers have closed since February.

In light of Pueblo voters' defeat of a city takeover of the Black Hills Energy electric franchise May 5, Pueblo West residents are renewing attention on the utility company's proposed transmission line which they fear will degrade property values here.
   
 The Black Hills Energy proposed Reliability Upgrade includes six proposed routes.
   
 In a comment letter read to the Metro District Board during its May 12 meeting, Pueblo West resident James Lembeck outlined a number of concerns he and his neighbors have about the proposal. Among concerns he listed was, "even through the Black Hills proposal states that it will benefit the residents, it is being constructed to get power to Canon City and the surrounding area west of Pueblo West. There isn't any mention now or at any time in the future how this line will benefit the residents," in Pueblo West.
   
 Lembeck also said, "The people here are very concerned about their property values and their health and how all of these (transmission line) costs are going to be passed along."
   
 He said he was under the impression a U.S. 50 route for the transmission line was scrapped because of concern for black-footed ferrets that live in that area.
   
 "Residents here in the proposed Pueblo West route have burrowing owls all over that are also a protected species," Lembeck said in his letter.
   
 At a February meeting, Pueblo West resident Mel Manrose also asked the metro district board to consider, "making a little noise" and letting the Pueblo County Commission know there is opposition to the proposal.
   
 "We already have a whole bunch of trnasmission lines here and I don't think that does much for us as a community," Manrose said.
   
 Metro Board Member Matt Smith told Manrose the board has sent a letter to Pueblo County informing the commission the board does not support the application.
   
 "We're continuing our outreach to landowners along the proposed Reliability Upgrade route. By working cooperatively with landowners, we've been able to secure easements for a substantial portion of the route," said Julie Rodriguez, community affairs manager for Black Hills Energy.
   
 "While our landowner dialogue continues, we're looking forward to the July 9th Pueblo County Commissioners meeting, where our 1041 permit application will be considered," she said.
   
 Currently, Black Hills Energy serves 6,446 customers in Pueblo West. By comparison, Pueblo West's other electric provider, San Isabel, serves about 8,000 meters.

“Weights are good and all but if you have that core strength, that’s really powerful. That’s your inner stuff. That’s all muscle,” Scott said. “Just doing core strength and going to the field, doing field work, trying to get my footwork right. Just going over the little things.”
 Scott also wants to continue improving his pass-catching ability as a junior. He made some strides in that area as a sophomore, debuting with 16 catches for 86 yards and then hauling in 26 for 211 last year.
 He wants to be more than just a player who hurts defenses with his downhill runs.
 “A player that has all the attributes, I should say, being the type of running back like that and showing the NFL coaches and people around the nation I can be that type of back,” Scott said. “That’s big and that’s something Coach Hart has emphasized in the running back room for all of us.”
 On his coach’s show, Tom Allen recently said he doesn’t want to see much change from Kalen DeBoer’s offense in 2019 to what new coordinator Nick Sheridan runs in 2020. Except, he added, the Hoosiers need to run the ball better. IU finished 12th in the Big Ten in rush offense last season.
 Hart believes the pieces are there to have more success on the ground, but talent alone won’t get the Hoosiers there. It’s about running the right way, hitting holes and getting yards after contact to “stay on schedule.” There also has to be a collective effort from the coaching staff to keep the running backs involved when defenses stack the box, which happened plenty in 2019.
 “The O-line is good enough, the running backs are good enough,” Hart said. “It comes down to us, the staff, putting in the correct game plan to get these guys where they need to go and utilize their talents.
 “Is it outside zone, is it inside zone, is it power?” Hart added. “What are we best at and how can we do it and how can we match those plays up with the pass?”
 Sheridan should have more than enough toys to play with out of the backfield, including the potent one-two punch of Scott and James. There is also the “athlete” Ellis, who debuted as a receiver in 2019 but practiced with the running backs in early March.
 “He’s got some speed, as you can see from the Penn State game when he caught that quick screen to the boundary and took it for about 70,” Hart said. “He’s an explosive play guy that we need to find a way to get the ball to, in whatever way we can.”
 As far as Scott, Hart expects to see an improved version whenever the Hoosiers return. He has plenty of reasons why.
 “He’s a kid that I know loves football and wants to be a great player, play in the NFL one day,” Hart said. “Just continue to work on the little things, reads, defensive scheme, where should the ball go, who’s blocking who. Just develop his knowledge of the game.”

PLYMOUTH - Whether you knew it by the name of the Plymouth Sports Dome, the Jungleplex, or even the Plymouth Sports Complex, since the summer of 1997 the building located off Long Pond Road at 8 Natalie Way in America's Hometown was always a hub of activity.
 It's been the place for athletes of all ages to play indoor soccer, lacrosse, volleyball and field hockey or even learn karate. It was also the go-to place for the high schools in town when the weather canceled spring practices. It was also packed to the rafters for mixed martial arts exhibitions and even a place for home shows and wedding exhibitions.
 Things are different now. These days there's no longer any kids running around the turf field chasing a soccer ball. Time marches on, things change and late in 2019 the building started to transition from an indoor sports emporium to a self-storage facility.
 But the memories remain.
 "I loved that place. I worked there in one form or another for about 20 years, I guess. It was an enjoyable time with some great memories, and I was able to work with a lot of awesome people. I lived just down the street from the building so I always loved that short drive to work," said Plymouth native Jason Tassinari, a former general manager of the facility who estimates that he officiated more than 6,000 soccer games there. "I had a lot of great times in that building and I will always think of it as a happy place for me."
 Original owners Carl Pratt, Dick Arietta, Al McChesney, Bill Weiler, Bill Johnson and Darin Yee first inflated the fabric roof of the Plymouth Sports Dome in the summer of 1997 and Tassinari joined on as an assistant manager and referee coordinator the next year. The bread-and-butter in the early days of the business was soccer training on the indoor and outdoor fields, but operations would expand in other directions over the years. Business was usually strong in the months from August to April; the key to the sustained success of the venture was finding revenue to help keep the lights on in the off-months.
 McChesney joined up with the ownership group as they were putting the final touches on what would become the Plymouth Sports Dome.
 "I got to know Darin Yee because we played together in the same men's hockey league," McChesney said. "They needed more money for the project and were looking for another investor to jump into the mix. I looked into what they were planning to do and liked the idea, so I joined up with them."
 "All of us had our lives outside of the business, but we came together to try and get this idea off of the ground. (Former Silver Lake boys soccer coach Bill Johnson and late SL boys basketball coach Dick Arieta) were the ones that got the ball rolling on this," McChesney said.
 McChesney said that when business was booming he was having as much fun as the kids chasing soccer balls under the dome roof.
 "It was a great seven years," remembered McChesney. "Walking into the building each weekend was like a scene out of Cheers. You looked around the lobby and there were people you knew all over the place. It really was the lifeblood of the community back then."
 Things were going well for the business until Mother Nature stepped in and threw everyone a curve ball in January 2005 with a winter storm that literally brought the roof down.
 "We had a smaller issue in December 2004 when a corner of the roof collapsed because of the weight of the snow. That should have been a sign to all of us that we were in trouble," Tassinari said. "Then there was a bigger storm on the way with a lot of snow and wind. None of us felt easy with what was coming. It was a nerve-racking time for all of us."
 It was all hands on deck when the storm finally hit town. Over a 48-hour period everyone did all they could to keep the bubble inflated, but the weight of the snow eventually brought down a section of the roof.
 The building was closed for a couple of years before returning with a new steel structure, a new ownership group, and a new name. But the Jungleplex could never get back the numbers it enjoyed before the roof collapsed. The facility was still being used for indoor games until the coronavirus outbreak earlier this year finally closed the doors for good.
 "Dave Wickson and I refereed maybe a thousand games together in that building. We were planning to do the last soccer game in the building together, but unfortunately life stepped in the way and changed all of our plans," Tassinari said. "I refereed games at the Jungleplex from back when I was a college freshman. It was a labor of love, and I was very sad to see the business go."

David Almeida, M.D., plans to run more than 50 miles Saturday.
   
 The Erie County course he's plotted, like where he's lived during his 40 years, goes all over the place.
   
 Almeida, an eye surgeon who moved to Erie in the spring of 2019, will run the near equivalent of consecutive marathons as a personal challenge.
   
 As an added incentive, though, his attempt will double as a fundraiser for the Second Harvest Food Bank of Northwestern Pennsylvania.
   
 "I've always found them an impressive organization," Almeida said. "It seems like they've gone the extra mile with what's going on right now (with the coronavirus), so I thought this would be a great way to bring them some more awareness."
   
 Almeida's unsanctioned event will begin and from the driveway of his South Shore Drive home. Starting at dawn, he'll pick up West Sixth Street to Route 5 and then follow it west until he reaches the Route 18 turnoff for Lake City.
   
 From there, Almeida will stride south through Girard and onto a series of back roads between Route 20 and Interstate 90. Once back on Route 20 in Fairview Township, he'll head east into Millcreek Township.
   
 However, Almeida will only be roughly halfway done at that point.
   
 He'll pick up Sterrettania Road to Presque Isle Boulevard and then complete one loop around Presque Isle State Park. Once back up the hill outside Waldameer Park, he'll cut back east on West Eighth Street.
   
 From there, Almeida will loop around Frontier Park and back to his driveway. He hopes to finish sometime between 2 and 3 p.m.
   
 Even more daunting for Almeida is that his very unofficial and glamour-free run also was planned with social distancing in mind.
   
 Nobody will fire a starter's gun. Nobody will hold the finish line banner.
   
 No spectators, at least no anticipated spectators, will cheer his progress.
   
 Support and aid for Almeida will consist of his wife, Jasmine, and three children, Max, Leo and Paloma. They're scheduled to provide liquids at designated course locations.
   
 Almeida joked about running a distance that won't be officially acknowledged beyond himself.
   
 "I wish I could say, yes, I'll run like a gazelle," he said, "but it will be ugly and painful. I haven't been running long, but I do like to think I'm built for strength."
   
 Almeida seeks to make Erie his long-term home after decades of globe trotting. He was born in Portugal, attended medical school in Canada and then moved back to Europe to receive a doctorate in pharmaceutical drug research from the University of Szeged in Hungary.
   
 A fellowship with the University of Iowa was Almeida's last stop before he arrived in Erie to open a private practice in retinal surgery.
   
 It was in and around Iowa's campus that Almeida said he began running two years ago.
   
 "I did some (five-kilometer) runs, then some (50 kilometer) runs," he said. "Then I did the Presque Isle Half Marathon when I got here last year. I've found I enjoy the longer runs more and more."
   
 Donations for Almeida's run can be made at nwpafoodbank.fenly.org/drive/david- almeidas-fundraiser. He had doubled his original goal of $500 by Tuesday morning.

Democratic Congressman Admits to Affair with Intern Just Before Crucial Primary, Throwing Election Up in the Air


--DocBreak--
WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate intelligence committee on Tuesday approved the nomination of Texas GOP Rep. John Ratcliffe to be director of national intelligence, sending the nomination to the Senate floor for his likely confirmation.
 "I'm happy we were able to get Ratcliffe out of the committee and hopefully get floor action quickly," Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, the panel's new acting chairman, told reporters. "It's an important position and it needs to be filled as soon as possible."
 Rubio was tapped Monday to temporarily replace North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr, who stepped aside as the FBI investigates his stock trades.
 Republicans have praised Ratcliffe, an ardent defender of President Donald Trump, while Democrats have been skeptical that he would serve with the independence they say is crucial for the job. Ratcliffe sought to shed his reputation as a Trump loyalist at his confirmation hearing earlier this month, insisting he would lead the nation's intelligence agencies without partisan influence.
 Ratcliffe would replace Dan Coats, a former GOP senator who was popular in Congress but who clashed with Trump in his two years in the job. Richard Grenell, who is close to Trump, is now the acting director.
 Ratcliffe was first picked for the post last summer, shortly after Coats' resignation, but then withdrew after some Senate Republicans questioned his experience. GOP senators warmed to Ratcliffe after Trump unexpectedly nominated him again  in February.
 The months in between were a tumultuous time in the intelligence community, as Trump ousted and fired multiple officials, and senators have said they are eager for a permanent replacement for Coats.
 At his hearing, Ratcliffe worked to separate himself from the president, including by saying he believed Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election, a conclusion Trump has often resisted. He said he would communicate to Trump the intelligence community's findings even if he knew Trump disagreed with them and might fire him.
 Democrats were not convinced. The top Democrat on the panel, Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, told Ratcliffe at the hearing that "I don't see what has changed since last summer" when his nomination was withdrawn.
 Ratcliffe's nomination was approved 8-7 in a closed committee hearing, with all Democrats voting against it, according to a committee aide.
 Ratcliffe sits on the House intelligence, judiciary and ethics committees. He forcefully questioned former special counsel Robert Mueller last summer when Mueller testified about the Russia investigation.
 He was also a member of Trump's impeachment advisory team last fall and aggressively questioned witnesses during the House impeachment hearings.
 The vote on Ratcliffe was Rubio's first official action as chairman. Burr said last week that he would step aside after federal agents showed up at his home with a warrant to search his cellphone. The Justice Department is investigating whether Burr exploited advance information when he unloaded as much as $1.7 million in stocks in February, days before the coronavirus pandemic caused markets to plummet.
 Burr, who remains on the committee, has denied any wrongdoing.

No more fun and games as the former indoor sports facility is now a self-storage business


--DocBreak--
But where this offseason falls short of the college ideal, Hart would think his position group, as much as any, would embrace that fact. It’s no secret Scott has NFL aspirations. When Scott was sidelined late in 2019, James proved his potential.
 And if the NFL is truly where the Hoosiers’ running backs want to head, they better get used to offseason training that’s away from a facility. Hart, who spent three seasons with the Indianapolis Colts, knows first-hand.
 “The one thing I emphasize to all our kids, if you want to play in the NFL, this is really an NFL schedule,” Hart said. “There are certain times of year you are not going to be around the coaches. You are not going to have mandatory workouts from this time to this time.
 “The guys who take care of their bodies, the guys who make the right decisions on and off the field, with what they are eating and what they are putting in their bodies, those are the guys that last in the league.”
 They are also the ones who will last at the top of IU’s depth chart.
 In 2020, Scott should be healthy, James will be a year more mature, and Ellis brings a versatile running/receiving threat into the fold. Whether the group lives up to its potential, there should be no letup right now. Not when many of them have legitimate NFL aspirations, hoping to follow in the footsteps of a Tevin Coleman or Jordan Howard. And not when slacking off back home could lead to reduced snaps in a competitive backfield.
 “When we compete, it’s for a good reason, because we want to see the best of each other,” Scott said. “Like Coach Hart says, he’s going to put the best player on the field. So really, we are all trying to be out there playing. So really, it comes down to who wants it more and just the love of the game.”
 Scott, the 6-foot-2, 231-pound workhorse, received more than double the carries (178) than his next closest competitor, James (81), last season. But James really flashed in an overtime win over Purdue, moving piles on his way to 118 yards.
 Either way, much of the Hoosiers’ success came when someone ran it well. In the 11 games he appeared, Scott amassed 662 yards on 124 carries (5.3 yards per) in seven wins. In four losses, he gained 183 yards on 54 carries (3.4 ypc). He missed IU’s bowl game to injury, as well, and the Hoosiers managed just 76 yards on 31 carries in a nail-biting loss to Tennessee.
 After a disappointing end to the season, the second-team All-Big Ten back is certainly motivated. Scott has been home, working out with his dad.

ROCHESTER -- Advocates and parents joined the city school board in welcoming former Brockport Central School District Superintendent Lesli Myers-Small as the city schools' new superintendent.
 The board unanimously approved her selection Monday afternoon.
 "There was one name that came up and only one name that came up in the context of finding a new superintendent," board President Van White said. "And it wasn't even a name for an interim. It was a name for a permanent superintendent and it was the name of Dr. Lesli."
 After the board voted during a Zoom conference, White signed the papers making the hiring official and the new superintendent revealed she is starting the job today.
 "I am excited," said Walida Montrose-Sims, a parent advocate as well as the mother and grandmother of students in the Rochester school system. "She is a champion in our community. She's a champion for our students, for our parents."
 In selecting her, board members emphasized her credentials and local connections.
 Myers-Small grew up in Pittsford and went to school at the University of Rochester and St. John Fisher College.
 "There were a number of people who talked about us hiring locally, and that is what we've done," board Vice President Cynthia Elliott said. "I don't think you can get a better candidate."
 Myers-Small joined school board leaders Monday and thanked them for their vote of confidence.
 "The children deserve a leader who is passionate," Myers-Small said, "who is student-focused, who has the connections with State Ed, which is what we are going to need some help with."
 Small was selected quickly after her predecessor, Terry Dade, abruptly left to become superintendent of Cornwall Central School District in the Hudson Valley. Board members pointed out that she had already been closely looked at and had been a finalist when Dade was hired.
 The new superintendent said she wants to hit the ground running to deal with the district's budget crunch as well as the still unknown long-term impact of the coronavirus.

“It was very important to myself and the commissioners, primarily for the jobs,” Duncan said. “I can’t really think of any other reason. We are giving up almost any revenue we are making. We are making very little, but 150 jobs is very large for Limestone County, not to mention they are good-paying jobs with benefits.”
 The facility, which opened about 25 years ago, has the capacity to hold 1,000 inmates. However, on Monday, there were 363 prisoners, including 201 being held for U.S. Immigration and Enforcement and 162 being held for the U.S. Marshals Service.
 The diminishing number of ICE prisoners has made it less profitable for LaSalle, a for-profit correctional firm that manages 18 facilities with a total inmate capacity of 13,000 in Texas, Louisiana and Georgia. And the U.S. Marshal’s Service is limiting the frequency with which it transfers federal prisoners during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
 To help convince LaSalle to stay in Groesbeck, Limestone County officials reduced LaSalle’s monthly payments to $15,000, down from a monthly average of $28,000 to $35,000 when the total was based on higher inmate counts. The county also agreed to pay for maintenance or repairs for projects more than $5,000, Duncan said.
 The new contract will be in effect through June 28, 2023, but LaSalle has the option of canceling it with 60-day notice. The monthly payment to the county will increase after one year and revert to the original plan based on inmate count, Duncan said.
 LaSalle corporate spokesman Scott Sutterfield did not return phone messages from the Tribune-Herald.

NATICK - Stew Brandt thinks his jewelry store should be open for in-store business.
 Brandt owns H. Brandt Jewelers on Main Street in downtown Natick, and must wait at least another three weeks before that could potentially happen.
 The timeline is part of Monday's announcement by Gov. Charlie Baker detailing the first phase of reopening the state's economy during COVID-19.
 Manufacturing and construction businesses and houses of worship can open immediately as long as they follow public health guidelines to protect employees and customers against COVID-19. Hair salons and barbershops can open next Monday.
 Jewelry stores, including Brandt's, didn't make the cut.
 "I should have been allowed to reopen," Brandt said, noting he took all necessary steps to protect customers, including wearing a face mask and gloves, installing a Plexiglass barrier in his customer service area, and steam cleaning and disinfecting his store.
    Where can you go and when, under Massachusetts' reopening plan after the coronavirus shutdown?  
 Curbside service and delivery can begin immediately at jewelry stores, and Brandt has taken those steps since Baker closed all non-essential businesses in late-March to help prevent the spread of COVID-19.
 Three weeks is the goal to move on to phase two, but Baker said nothing is certain until the public health data is analyzed from phase one to determine if it's safe enough to move forward.
 Restaurants, a sector of the economy hit hard by the stay-and-home and social distancing orders, must wait until phase two to begin opening indoor dining areas. Meanwhile, takeout and delivery will continue.
 Anderson Torres opened Franklin Street Cafe in downtown Framingham 10 months ago, has eight employees, and cut their hours to help keep his business afloat during the pandemic.
 "Everybody is suffering with this," Torres said, noting that he supports the state's decision to hold off on reopening restaurants.
    Group warns against 'premature' reopening of Massachusetts while the coronavirus pandemic continues  
 "Safety first, even if it hurts us economically," Torres said.
 Why barbershops and hair dressers can open immediately, while restaurants must wait at least three weeks, doesn't make sense to Jim Giammarinaro, chairman of the MetroWest Chamber of Commerce, which represents roughly 450 local businesses, the vast majority of them small businesses and nonprofits.
 Giammarinaro believes those who cut and style hair must work right on top of customers, while restaurants can maintain safe social-distancing guidelines of 6 feet.
 "My bother is a hairdresser in Framingham. How is a hairdresser safer than a restaurant?," Giammarinaro asked rhetorically. "I don't understand that."

 Monday's announcement that manufacturing businesses are immediately back online is "huge" for Framingham businesses, like chemical manufacturer DetraPel, microbrewer Jack's Abby and Exhibit 'A' Brewing Company, according to Courtney Thraen, executive director of Downtown Framingham Inc., a nonprofit that supports local business development.
 A "tough call" is how Thraen described the three-week waiting period before restaurants can potentially reopen in phase two, adding she worked with Torres so he could recently finish an outdoor patio at his restaurant for additional seating.
 "Restaurants are really hungry to get their customers in the door," Thraen said.
    When a coronavirus vaccine is developed, who will be first in line to get it? A CDC panel usually decides  
 A "slow ramp up," is how Erick Lacy, project executive at Consigli Construction in Milford, described next steps for reopening.
 Starting Monday, Consigli will begin what Lacy called "open air projects," essentially new construction done outside that extends beyond the indoor work that the company has done since the state of emergency went into effect.
 Consigli will also focus on further developing protective measures for its workers on-site, especially in preparation for a possible second wave of COVID-19. That includes reinforcing social distancing and mandatory orders that all on-site workers wear face masks. Decisions about which employees can work at home will also be considered.
 Brandt, the Natick jewelry store owner, suffered a significant drop in sales during the pandemic.
 In March, his sales tax collections declined 79%. Last month it was worse, down 96%.
 Brandt has turned to Facebook and e-commerce platforms to make sales, but they're not enough to meet his fixed costs like rent, phone and utilities.
    U.S. retail sales plunged a record 16% in April as virus hit  
 Twelve years ago during a string a snowstorms in February that cut off his revenue, Brandt learned to always have a rainy day fund to cover himself for a couple months if needed.
 Fortunately for Brandt, he has such a fund that allowed him to weather the last couple months.
 Losing business is hard to swallow during COVID-19, but what hurts Brandt more is that he had planned to spend time with his grandchildren in Israel.
 COVID-19 made that trip impossible.
 "That was the worst part," Brandt said. "It was harder than not working."

Taylor Swift impresses during the all too short City of Lover concert special.      Much to the devastation of Swifties around the world, the coronavirus put pay to the American’s 2020 tour along with the rest of the live music scene. Fortunately, a taste of the live Lover experience lives on in the form of footage recorded in Paris just after the name sake album’s release.      Filmed at L’Olympia Bruno Coquatrix in Paris, the show has been cut and crammed into 40 minutes. First for American television and then for streaming services Disney+ and Hulu.      The special opens with the joyously cheesy ‘ME!’, With Swift confidently strutting onto the stage. ‘The Archer’ soon follows and sets the tone while showcasing its artist on the top of her game.      The synth driven track details a lover desperate to ensure her relationship stays on the tracks, and fearful that she might be the cause of its destruction. The song, prods, probes and questions its storyteller.      Proceedings quickly shift as the piano is wheeled on and the viewer is treated to a mini acoustic set. With stripped back versions of, ‘The Man’, 'Cornelia Street', and ‘Daylight’ the 30-year-old not only shows off a strong vocal performance but engaging immersive lyricism to boot.      ‘Daylight’ stands out particularly in this vein as it appears to take the listener on a vivid journey of, low points, cynicism, before achieving the cleansing feeling of true love and happiness.      The concert is an appetizing morsel of what the Lover tour could have been, but the night’s festivities were cut far too short. Whether because of TV time constraints or possible contractual restrictions placed upon the star by her former record label, the back catalog is noticeably absent from the program's edit.      According to the website Setlist fm, home viewers missed out on crowd-pleasers like, ‘Style’ ‘Shake It off’, ‘Blank Space’ and most egregiously beloved fan favourite ‘All Too Well’.      The broadcast sees Taylor Swift on good form as both a performer and a lyricist. Unfortunately, at just over 40 minutes, streamers are left out a potentially great moments.

Iran has good reasons to take the threat against its vessels seriously. In May 2018, President Trump broke with European partners and pulled out of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), aimed at limiting Iran’s nuclear program, and reimposed sanctions on Iran. Last summer, in a remarkable display of double standards, British Royal Marines stopped and raided an Iranian ship “suspected of carrying oil to Syria.” Days later, according to the UK’s Ministry of Defense, “contrary to international law, three Iranian vessels attempted to impede the passage of a commercial vessel, British Heritage, through the Strait of Hormuz.”[10] The Trump administration’s targeted assassination in January of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani, who coordinated anti-terrorism efforts in the Middle East and was a national hero, sent shock waves throughout the Middle East and brought these two nations to the brink of war.[11] On April 22, in the context of heightened tensions between Tehran and Washington, Trump tweeted: “I have instructed the United States Navy to shoot down and destroy any and all Iranian gunboats if they harass our ships at sea.”[12] In both the Persian Gulf and the Caribbean, US warships have become the explicit arm of Washington’s gunboat diplomacy.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Donald Trump implored Senate Republicans to "be tough" on Democrats heading into the fall election, touting his own poll numbers against rival Joe Biden during a free-wheeling private lunch on Capitol Hill.
 With top White House advisers in tow, Trump attended what was perhaps one of the largest social gatherings still happening in locked-down Washington as officials consider next steps in the coronavirus response.
 "We had a great meeting -- all of the Republican senators were there," Trump told reporters.
 The private luncheon at the nearly closed U.S. Capitol complex was billed as an opportunity for Trump to thank senators for their work in fighting the virus outbreak and shoring up the economy, officials said.
 But as senators from the 53-seat GOP majority convened behind closed doors, the discussion swiftly turned to politics and Trump's "enthusiasm" for the campaign against Biden, the presumed Democratic nominee, senators said.
 "He admonished all of us to be tough, fight back," Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, told reporters afterward.
 Democrats are eager to flip control of the Senate from Republicans as voters assess Trump's handling of the pandemic crisis. Cornyn said the president explained to the senators, "It's going to be a pitched battle."
 The president's visits are often free-flowing conversations and Republicans said various topics were discussed.
 But the hour-long session did not change the GOP position to hold off, until June, on a new round of virus aid for states and struggling Americans.
 "We need to assess what we've already done, take a look at what worked and what didn't," said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., afterward. "We'll discuss the way forward in the next couple of weeks."
 The U.S. Capitol building remains largely closed with the House away due to health risks, but the Senate is in session and the GOP majority still hashes out policy behind closed doors over lunch on Tuesdays.
 With new social distancing restrictions, the Senate gathering was held in a bigger room across the street from the Capitol rather than the regular one steps from the Senate chamber. Many senators were masked and seating was limited to three to a table.
 It was among the few known gatherings still happening in the nation's capital, which remains under stay-home orders through June 8 as the virus outbreak tallies new cases and fatalities. One GOP senator and dozens of Capitol Hill workers and staff have tested positive for the virus. Senate Democrats skip in-person meetings and convene weekly by conference call.
 Trump set off alarms when he disclosed this week  that he is taking a drug, hydroxycholorquine, despite grave warnings from health officials and the U.S. government that the anti-malaria drug is unproven against COVID-19, and carries severe health risks, including death.
 He did not discuss his decision to take the drug during the private lunch, senators said.
 Tuesday brought a full day of administration appearances on Capitol Hill. Earlier, Vice President Mike Pence and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin huddled with McConnell and House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy for a previously scheduled meeting.
 They discussed the COVID-19 response and the economy, said a person unauthorized to describe the meeting and granted anonymity.
 But it did not appear to change Republicans' outlook that more funds are needed for the pandemic response.
 "I don't see the need right now," McCarthy told reporters at the Capitol.
 He said they discussed different items, "the economy, the number of states that are opening back up," and the outlook for virus testing. "Getting a lot of updates."
 While House Democrats passed a new virus aid package  last week, Senate Republicans say they're not interested in providing more funds until they assess how the $2 trillion in already approved money to fight the virus and improve the economy is being spent.
 McConnell has said there's no urgency to act on the latest $3 trillion bill from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. He has declared the package a "seasonal catalogue" of liberal programs.
 Pelosi's package includes $900 billion to states and cities to shore up their budgets during the crisis and prevent mass layoffs of state and local government workers. Regional tax revenues have plummeted during the shutdown. There's also money for more virus testing, a fresh round of $1,200 rebate checks for cash-strapped Americans and other aid.
 Republicans prefer to wait to see if efforts to open up the economy can provide a kick-start and lessen the need for more aid.
 "Very helpful," said Mnuchin as he exited the meeting on his way to testify before the Senate Banking Committee. "Good update."

“There was a time when the private prison was a golden goose for Limestone County,” said Sheriff Dennis Wilson. “It brought in $3.5 million a year for the county. But that was when demand was high. It was very profitable for the county, but if you stay in this business long enough, that ball swings to the right and swings to the left and back and forth. I’m not sure we will ever get back to seeing the demand we saw 20 years ago.”
 Under the current contract with LaSalle, no state or county inmates can be housed at the detention center. Both Wilson and Duncan attribute the decline in ICE detainees held at the facility to President Donald Trump’s immigration enforcement policies.
 “I think in time it will be good for the county,” said Wilson, who is retiring to conclude a 45-year law enforcement career at the end of the year. “You have to look at what it does for our local community. When the prison is up and running good, we reach out to local vendors in our community and they benefit as well. Most of the guards live in Limestone County and they shop at local stores. LaSalle wants to be good partners, and keeping those jobs here is important. And those are good federal-wage level jobs.”
 Several private correctional companies over the years have operated the facility, which sat vacant from 2013 to 2016, Wilson said.
 LaSalle operated the Jack Harwell Detention Center in Waco for a number of years before McLennan County took over operations late last year. The facility had been operated by private, for-profit companies since the county built it with proceeds from a $49 million bond package issued in 2009.
 Before LaSalle agreed to let its $8 million contract with McLennan County expire, the facility failed three of its last inspections, resulting in the State Commission on Jail Standards placing a remedial order against the facility in May 2019. LaSalle was cited for failure to keep a minimum ratio of jailers to inmates, failure to conduct visual checks and failure to have proper identification procedures for inmates.
 Wilson and Duncan say they have received no complaints about LaSalle management at the Limestone County facility.
 Anali Looper, director of the Waco office of American Gateway, a nonprofit immigration legal service provider, said LaSalle officials recently invited her group into the Limestone County detention center to help detainees with asylum applications and bond and parole requests.
 “We were hoping to get in there, so it is nice to be invited,” Looper said. “It was nice to see them recognize that it is mutually beneficial when detainees there are getting adequate services. It helps everyone out.”
