Amid the ongoing US election uncertainty, investors stuck to a tried-and- tested play during this pandemic era. With neither Joe Biden nor President Donald Trump having yet attained the 270 electorate votes needed to claim an outright win, market participants flocked to US tech counters once more.

Series S's size arguably stems more from power downgrades across the board: a slightly slower CPU, a GPU with fewer compute units, less RAM at lower bandwidth, and a lower power draw. That also means the console generates less heat, so it requires a smaller fan system to keep the system running cool and quiet.

WASHINGTON — Democrat Joe Biden was pushing closer to the 270 Electoral College votes needed to carry the White House, securing victories in the "blue wall" battlegrounds of Wisconsin and Michigan and narrowing President Donald Trump's path.
 With just a handful of states still up for grabs, Trump tried to press his case in court in some key swing states. It was unclear if any of his campaign's legal maneuvering over balloting would succeed in shifting the race in his favor.
 Two days after Election Day, neither candidate had amassed the votes needed to win the White House. But Biden's victories in the Great Lakes states left him at 264, meaning he was one battleground state away — any would do — from becoming president-elect.

Sheik contrasts that method with the way he typically writes for theater (he has composed for nine productions so far). For this work, he says he will usually write with other lyricists. “All bets are off in terms of it being remotely autobiographical,” he says. “There's these other characters and this other persona. Of course you're always drawing from your own experience to some extent, but it's a very, very different thing where you're telling a story or using the voice of another person, whether that's a character or another writer. So that's a whole other kind of process.”

The ample on-site offerings at this 6,000-acre property are extensive and tough to beat. From its mountain bike trails, escape rooms, adventure parks, and hiking trails to its winter ski slopes and ice skating rinks, there's no shortage of adventures to keep guests busy. The property is also ideally situated to take in spectacular views of the Blue Ridge Mountains while participating in outdoor activities.
 Thanks to both condo-style rooms and standard hotel rooms, Massanutten Resort is an excellent choice for a wide range of travelers, but appeals to families in particular. While the entry-level rooms offer an excellent deal coming in under $100, for those looking to social distance, the condo and townhouse accommodations are the way to go. The private entrances, full kitchens, en- suite laundry, and outdoor decks with grills allow guests to be totally self- sufficient while on vacation, which is especially nice during the pandemic.
 Adding to the appeal right now, the property is taking COVID-19 policies seriously. From the complimentary disposable masks and disinfectant wipes at check-in, to the staff strictly adhering to wearing masks properly at all times, I felt very safe throughout my stay. I found Massanutten Resort to be a much-needed retreat for reconnecting with nature and enjoying a COVID-safe vacation with friends.

Load times seemed solid across the board, but I saw nothing that lined up with the lofty promises made during the console announcement in regards to the solid-state drive. In general, the experience was akin to what you would find on a random gaming PC with a SATA SSD. Red Dead Redemption 2 is notable for having load times in excess of 2-3 minutes on Xbox One X. When I loaded it up on Series X, I was able to go from the main menu to walking around Saint-Denis in just over a minute. This is a notable improvement as Red Dead Redemption 2 does have any specific Series X enhancement. The load times still fell short of the NVME SSD in my gaming PC, but this situation could change as new software is written to take advantage of the storage solution in the Series X.

The “Land of independents” campaign rounded off a summer of collaborative partnerships. The UK’s public-service broadcasters – the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 – united to launch “Our stories”, their first joint consumer marketing campaign to promote the power of TV. The government, meanwhile, worked with news brands on a series of Covid-19 awareness campaigns in the national press. And ITV is talking up collaboration once more with the launch of Planet V, its addressable ad-buying platform.
 Kelly Williams, ITV’s managing director, commercial, wants Sky, Channel 4 and others to come on to the platform in the coming years, because buying on it should become easier with more broadcasters on board. “We’re not going to win by all of us building different technologies,” Williams claims. “We’re going to win by collaborating on tech and competing on content.”
 Even before Covid-19, the changing market was forcing rivals to consider working together – from the UK’s biggest news brands pooling their digital ad sales in The Ozone Project to the ITV-BBC collaboration on BritBox, a joint streaming venture, to take on the US giants.
 It is tempting to write off such moves as defensive or traditional media huddling together for warmth, while Google and Facebook capture the lion’s share of revenue growth. But even tech titan Microsoft had to embrace collaboration to bounce back from decline to regain its spot (albeit briefly) as the world’s most valuable company last year. Chief executive Satya Nadella bravely decided to make its ubiquitous Windows and Office software open- source, thus embracing outside engineering ideas instead of hoarding intellectual property at all costs.
 Covid-19 has certainly encouraged a new spirit of collaboration, as seen at the start of the pandemic with media owners giving away inventory to support “Clap for carers” and other community initiatives.

Several catalog titles received enhancements for the Series X launch, including Gears 5, Gears Tactics, Sea of Thieves, Forza Horizon 4, and The Touryst. Gears 5 is the clear standout here, as the 4K/60Hz boost with improved settings that bring it to parity with the PC version is solid. It looks and plays the part of what one would expect to see from a previous-gen game promising to make use of upgraded hardware. Sea of Thieves got a patch that allowed for 60Hz output, a first for consoles. The added smoothness and controller responsiveness is the icing on the cake for an already solid multiplayer pirate adventure. It is now arguably superior to the PC version thanks to the inclusion of HDR output. I personally found the enhanced version of Forza Horizon 4 to be disappointing after spending hundreds of hours with the stellar PC version over the last two years. Players can choose between visuals or framerate, but both options seem to use settings lower than the PC Medium equivalent.

Rajasthan has become the second among the dissenting states following Puducherry to take the option to borrow Rs 1.1 lakh crore to meet the goods and service tax GST compensation shortfall. The finance ministry said in a statement on Thursday that Rajasthan will get Rs 4,604 crore through special borrowing window and will be permitted to raise an additional Rs 5,462 crore through borrowings under the relaxation of availing 0.5% of the state gross domestic product. Government of India already borrowed an amount of Rs 12,000 crore on behalf of states in two instalments and has passed it on to 21 states and three union territories on October 23 and November 2, 2020. Rajasthan will receive funds raised through this window, the finance ministry said. The next instalment of borrowings is likely to be released on November 9, 2020, the Centre added. The Centre had given two borrowing options to states and UTs to meet the compensation shortfall for 2020-21, of which Rs 1.1 lakh crore option was chosen by 21 states and two UTs. Under this option, the Centre agreed to borrow and provide to states while the principal and interest will be serviced from the compensation cess collected. The special borrowing window coordinated by the finance ministry allows for back-to-back borrowing by the Centre and further transfer to states. Some opposition-led states and UTs, including West Bengal, Rajasthan, Kerala, Chhattisgarh and Puducherry, had rejected both the borrowing options provided by the Centre – Rs 97,000 crore and Rs 2.35 lakh crore. Puducherry took the Rs 1.1 lakh crore borrowing option earlier this week to become the third union territory. After Rajasthan taking the option it remains to be seen whether other states will take the option as well. Finance secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey told ET in an interview last week that the government was trying to bring the dissenting states on board. “On revenue loss and other aspects, one can have discussions. I’m sure other states will also review their positions. We will try to convince them,” he had said. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had written to the states and UT last month, asking them to rethink their decision and take the borrowing Option to get faster access to funds. States have collectively raised Rs 83,914 crore under the additional borrowing of 0.50% of GSDP allowed under Option 1, over and above the Special Window of Rs 1.1 lakh crore through the special window to meet the shortfall arising out of GST implementation. States who have opted for Option-1 are – Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Odisha, Rajasthan, Sikkim, Tripura, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, and Uttarakhand, along with the three Union Territories of Delhi, Jammu & Kashmir and Puducherry.

El representante Paul Gosar, republicano de Arizona y férreo defensor de Trump, se sumó a la multitud y afirmó: “No vamos a dejar que roben estas elecciones. Punto”.
 Sin embargo, seguía habiendo observadores de los dos grandes partidos dentro del centro electoral mientras las boletas se procesaban y contaban, y el proceso se emitía en vivo a través de internet en todo momento.
 Dos importantes funcionarios del condado, uno demócrata y otro republicano, emitieron un comunicado expresando su preocupación por cómo se había extendido al desinformación sobre la integridad del proceso electoral.
 “Todo el mundo debería querer que se cuenten todos los votos, ya fueran por correo o presentados en persona”, afirmó el comunicado firmado por Clint Hickman, presidente republicano de la Junta de Supervisores de Maricopa, y el supervisor demócrata Steve Gallardo. “Una votación precisa requiere tiempo (...) Esto es una prueba de democracia, no de fraude”.
 Entre tanto, desde la ciudad de Nueva York a Seattle, miles de manifestantes salieron a la calle para reclamar que se contaran todos los votos.
 En Portland, Oregon, donde se han registrado protestas periódicas durante meses, la gobernadora, Kate Brown, desplegó a la Guardia Nacional cuando los manifestantes cometieron lo que las autoridades describieron como violencia generalizada en el centro de la ciudad, lo que incluyó reventar ventanas. Los manifestantes en Portland protestaban por temas desde la brutalidad policial al conteo de votos.
 “Es importante confiar en el proceso, y el sistema que ha garantizado elecciones libres y justas en este país durante décadas, incluso en épocas de grandes crisis”, dijo Brown en un comunicado. “Todos estamos juntos en esto”.
 Richard March dijo haber acudido a una marcha contra Trump en Portland pese a tener un problema cardiaco que le hacía vulnerable al COVID-19.
 “Cuestionar estas elecciones tiene consecuencias terribles para nuestra democracia”, dijo. “Creo que ahora somos una sociedad muy polarizada, y me preocupa lo que va a pasar en los próximos días y semanas y meses”.
 En Nueva York, cientos de personas pasaron junto a tiendas de lujo protegidas con tablones en la Quinta Avenida. En Chicago, los manifestantes marcharon por el centro y junto a una calle al otro lado del río de la Trump Tower.
 Protestas similares, en ocasiones sobre las elecciones y en otras sobre la desigualdad racial, se desarrollaron en por lo menos media docena de ciudades, incluidas Los Ángeles, Seattle, Houston, Pittsburgh, Minneapolis y San Diego.
 Michigan ha estado en alerta durante varios meses por inquietudes de violencia política. En la primavera, varios manifestantes en contra del gobierno portaron armas al Capitolio estatal durante protestas contra las restricciones implementadas por la pandemia, y seis hombres fueron arrestados el mes pasado bajo cargos de conspirar para secuestrar a la gobernadora, Gretchen Whitmer.

Second-term Republican U.S. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick in Bucks County, just north of Philadelphia, won reelection after being a top target again for Democrats as one of just three House Republicans in the country running for reelection in a district won by Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016′s presidential contest.
 Fitzpatrick, a mild-mannered former FBI agent who took over the seat from his late brother, had been challenged by a relative political unknown nominated by Democrats, Christina Finello.
 Fitzpatrick voted for Trump's tax cut and opposed his impeachment. Finello attacked Fitzpatrick as too weak to stand up to Trump and silent in the face of the president's worst transgressions.
 Democrats have a roughly 15,000-voter registration advantage in the district, which Clinton won by 2 percentage points.

 Freshman Democrat U.S. Rep. Susan Wild defended her Allentown-area seat against Republican nominee Lisa Scheller, a former Lehigh County commissioner who started a pigment manufacturer for paints, coatings and inks and touts her background as someone recovered from addiction who advocates for people in recovery.
 Wild, a prominent lawyer in Allentown, scored a 10-percentage-point thumping of her Republican opponent in 2018′s campaign for what was an open seat.
 The district is daunting for a Republican. Democrats have a 60,000-voter registration advantage, and Wild had a 3-to-1 campaign cash advantage going into July.

 Four-term Democratic U.S. Rep. Matt Cartwright in northeastern Pennsylvania is in his third go-round of seeking reelection in a district where Trump is popular.
 This time Cartwright was challenged by Jim Bognet, a first-time candidate who won a six-person GOP primary, in part, by promising to be a staunch Trump ally.
 The district is anchored by the cities of Scranton and Wilkes-Barre, both Democratic bastions. But the party's voter-registration advantage in the district -- still at a considerable 58,000 -- is shrinking, and Republican hopes of capturing it are perennial.

 CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT 10
 Four-term Republican U.S. Rep. Scott Perry, possessor of one of the most conservative voting records in the House, was challenged by two-term state Auditor General Eugene DePasquale.
 The race attracted more than $500,000 in spending by outside groups after a Democratic opponent with little name recognition came within 2.5 percentage points of knocking off Perry in 2018.
 The district, which includes the cities of York and Harrisburg, has a Republican registration edge of about 22,000, and Trump won it by 9 points in 2016.

 CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT 16
 Republican U.S. Rep. Mike Kelly won a sixth term in a northwestern Pennsylvania district against a political newcomer, teacher Kristy Gnibus, after Kelly won a race, into which national Democrats poured cash, by 4 percentage points in 2018.
 Republicans have a small registration advantage, about 22,000, but Democratic parts of the district took the same conservative turn in 2016 as other historically Democratic parts of Pennsylvania where residents are whiter, less affluent and less educated.

 CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT 17
 U.S. Rep. Conor Lamb sought a second full term after becoming a Democratic star in 2018 for winning two races in two Trump districts -- a special election in a district Trump won by 20 percentage points and a general election in a redrawn district against a three-term incumbent.
 He declared victory late Wednesday night, but The Associated Press has yet to call the race.
 Lamb faced a challenge from Republican Sean Parnell, a decorated Army vet who is a regular guest on Fox News programs -- he announced his candidacy during an appearance on "Fox & Friends" -- and is known for his memoir on the war in Afghanistan and authoring two action novels.
 Parnell is also a Trump darling. He got a speaking slot at the Republican National Convention and campaign stump shoutouts from Trump, with southwestern Pennsylvania a regular destination for Trump.
 Parnell, in turn, adopted Trump's law-and-order rhetoric.
 The district runs from Pittsburgh's suburbs through Ohio River towns to the Ohio border and has a heavy -- albeit shrinking -- Democratic registration advantage of 62,000 votes. But it is also home to many conservative Democrats who helped Trump win it by 2.5 percentage points in 2016.

 ATTORNEY GENERAL
 Heather Heidelbaugh, a lawyer from Mount Lebanon and a former Allegheny County Council member, won the Republican nomination to take on Democratic Attorney General Josh Shapiro after running unopposed in the primary.
 Heidelbaugh has described Shapiro as lacking experience as a courtroom lawyer and having chased headlines to feed political ambition. She cites his recent and repeated publicizing of coronavirus-related price gouging cases.
 On what Heidelbaugh calls her top priority, criminal prosecutions, she hopes to start her term by convening a meeting of county district attorneys to help determine the best direction in the fight against opioids and methamphetamine.
 Shapiro, a resident of Abington, is a former state lawmaker and Montgomery County commissioner who sought a second term.
 He took over following the debacle that was Democrat Kathleen Kane's term in office. Kane resigned in the fourth year of her term after being convicted of fraud and later served jail time.
 Shapiro oversaw the investigation that culminated in the August 2018 release of a grand jury report that found about 300 Roman Catholic priests in Pennsylvania had sexually abused children for seven decades, and that their higher-ups helped cover it up.

 TREASURER
 Joe Torsella, considered a potential gubernatorial or U.S. Senate candidate, said his major accomplishments as state treasurer include setting up a scholarship program that begins for children at birth and leading a lawsuit against large Wall Street banks over their bond fees.
 The lawsuit resulted in a nearly $400 million settlement over the price fixing claims, money that is being split with other plaintiffs. He has also moved more of the state's investments into index funds, putting the state on track to save hundreds of millions of dollars in investment fees in the coming decades.
 Torsella, 57, a resident of Flourtown, served as President Barack Obama's envoy for United Nations management and reform, headed the National Constitution Center, and was former Gov. Ed Rendell's choice to serve as chairperson of the Pennsylvania State Board of Education.
 The Republican challenger was Stacy Garrity, 56, who retired as a colonel in 2016 after 30 years with the Army Reserves. She is vice president of a tungsten smelting plant.
 Garrity, who lives in Athens in Bradford County, wants to use the Treasury Department's leverage to push lawmakers and the governor to limit spending to money that has been formally appropriated by the Legislature and end the executive branch's spending of money outside the pre-approval process.
 Joseph Soloski is the Libertarian candidate running for treasurer, Timothy Runkle the Green Party's.
 ____
 AUDITOR GENERAL
 The race for auditor general pitted Republican Timothy L. DeFoor, a county controller in central Pennsylvania, against Democrat Nina Ahmad, a former deputy Philadelphia mayor.
 DeFoor is Black and Ahmad was born in Bangladesh, so in January the state's first elected "row officer" of color will begin work.
 Ahmad, 61, who has a doctorate in chemistry, has said she wants to expand the office's traditional watchdog role so that it also examines how equitably public money gets distributed. She wants to focus on charter schools and do what she can to expand high-speed internet.
 DeFoor, 58, the elected controller in Dauphin County, which includes Harrisburg, touts his experience as making him uniquely qualified for the office. He has spent three decades conducting governmental audits and fraud investigations for the state inspector general, the state attorney general and a large hospital system.
 The Green Party candidate for auditor general is Olivia Faison, and the Libertarian is Jennifer Lynn Moore.

 LEGISLATURE
 All 203 state House seats and half the 50-person Senate were before the voters, with Republican majority control in both chambers at stake.
 At least two incumbent Democrats lost. First-term Rep. Wendy Ullman of Bucks County in the Philadelphia suburbs was defeated by Republican Shelby Labs. Democrats also saw hopes of regaining a Senate majority become dimmer as Republican Devlin Robinson unseated Sen. Pam Iovino in a suburban Pittsburgh district.
 Democrats went into the election needing a net pickup of nine seats to regain the state House majority, which they have not had in a decade. Two years ago, Democrats gained 11 seats to get to 93 members, versus 110 Republicans.
 The Senate is closer, with Democrats needing four seats for a tie that would give them effective majority control. That gap widened with Iovino's loss.

L'Amministrazione Comunale di Pavullo sta lavorando per trovare le giuste modalita per riqualificare il muro della frazione di Lavacchio; muro pubblico, che fu negli anni '80, oggetto di una progettualita artistica che ha visto la realizzazione di opere di pittura, scultura e mosaico da parte di artisti nazionali ed internazionali.      "Sui Muri di Lavacchio" e il titolo della prima Biennale d'Arte, a cura dell'Assessorato alla Cultura del Comune di Pavullo nel Frignano, nata per dare visibilita ad un maggior numero di artisti, per vivacizzare la cultura e l'arte del territorio con particolare riferimento e coinvolgimento delle giovani generazioni.      Il concorso e aperto a tutti gli artisti singoli o in gruppo (eta minima 16 anni) che risiedono, lavorano o studiano a Modena e provincia. La partecipazione e gratuita, non comporta quindi costi per l'iscrizione, bensi di essere protagonista in un percorso espositivo di valorizzazione del territorio.   L'obiettivo e ridare visibilita e valore al muro di Lavacchio in relazione al nuovo contesto pubblico ed urbano della frazione, recuperare il patrimonio architettonico soggetto a degrado, attraverso la promozione della creativita e dell'arte e tramite l'offerta di momenti di partecipazione per gli artisti, ed infine stimolare il senso di appartenenza alla comunita. Il bando richiede la progettazione e realizzazione di un bozzetto, il cui tema verte sulla relazione e il dialogo tra l'uomo e la natura. L'opera deve necessariamente riportare un elemento che richiama l'identita, la storia o la cultura di Pavullo nel Frignano o del territorio circostante, lasciando libera interpretazione alla composizione artistica, alle moderne tecniche pittoriche. I bozzetti verranno valutati da una commissione giudicatrice che selezionera 16 opere.

One might naturally wonder if this acquisition would cause SweetWater to lose “craft brewer” qualification via the much-ballyhooed Brewers Association definition, but in this case it would not. Specifically, SweetWater would remain a craft brewer in the eyes of the BA because Aphria Inc. is itself not a beverage company—thus, SweetWater would still qualify under the “independent” banner, much in the same way as the breweries that joined together in the CANarchy collective, such as Cigar City and Oskar Blues. Notable is the fact that SweetWater had managed to continue growing during the industry’s slowdown—in 2019 they produced 260,420 barrels, an increase of 7% from the year before.

No. 15 Coastal Carolina has already reached a couple of major landmarks. Now, the Chants could be eying another milestone with a spot in a New Year's Six bowl game.
 The Chanticleers (6-0, 4-0 Sun Belt Conference) became bowl eligible for the first time in their three seasons playing in college football's top tier with a 51-0 victory over Georgia State last week. The next day, Coastal Carolina became the Sun Belt's highest-ever ranked team.
 If the wins keep piling up, the Chants could become impossible to keep out of a New Year's Six bowl come next month.
 The quest continues Saturday night when Coastal Carolina plays South Alabama (3-3, 2-1).

SweetWater was founded in Atlanta in 1997 by Freddy Bensch, who had visited the city during the 1996 Olympic Games before deciding to put down roots there. At the time, it was one of only four breweries in Atlanta—only one other of which, Atlanta Brewing Co., is still active today. Growth was exponential and furious, especially after the introduction of beloved flagship 420, and SweetWater eventually built itself into the largest craft brewery in the Southeast. Today, by the Brewers Association definition of “craft brewer,” they rank as the 14th largest American craft brewery by volume. And in recent years, much of that growth has increasingly been driven by products even more deeply rooted in cannabis, especially the 420 Strain series, which is infused with terpenes. The brewery is also well known for its annual 420 Fest music festival, which takes place each year on the weekend nearest to April 20. Additionally, its beer is available on every Delta Airlines flight, nationwide.

More than 1.7 million Venezuelans currently live in Colombia, where they have moved to escape their nation's economic and humanitarian crisis. According to immigration officials, only 720,000 have a residence permit, which forces many migrants to work for less than the minimum wage or make a living as buskers or street vendors.
 Alfonso says that she was already performing for tips in her hometown of Caracas, long before she arrived in Bogota. She worked mostly on subway cars, where her shows earned her an invitation to a local television program.
 Two years ago, she moved to Colombia because rapping in Venezuela's subways no longer helped her to make ends meet. Alfonso says she can make about $8 a day from tips on Bogota's Transmilenio. It's enough to pay rent and send some money home to her daughter.
 "I'm showing people how to not feel defeated," Alfonso said after finishing a set of songs. "Our hearts have no wrinkles in them. I'm 69 and there's still a lot of juice to squeeze from this orange."
 But being a street rapper isn't easy. Alfonso suffers from glaucoma and cannot see out of her left eye. She doesn't have enough money to go to a specialist and moves around with a stick to avoid falling.
 The grandmother can't see the buttons on her speaker's remote control properly, so she asks commuters for help to play the right tracks.
 "We worry about her," said Volcan, who frequently runs into Alfonso on the Transmilenio. "She lives up a steep hill and we're trying to find her a place to rent that is closer to the bus stop."
 Alfonso presses on despite the obstacles and delivers her routine in which she encourages commuters to laugh because "humor is for free."
 Some take selfies with the toothless grandmother, and others have posted videos of her singing on buses that have gone viral on Twitter.
 This growing recognition comes as some Venezuelan migrants also make headlines in Colombia for committing crimes that include robberies on public buses.
 In Bogota, which is home to more than 350,000 Venezuelans, Mayor Claudia Lopez recently said that some migrants are giving her "headaches" and that "we should immediately deport anyone who comes to commit crimes."
 The declarations were applauded by some of her supporters, but also rejected by national immigration officials who said that only 4% of crimes reported in Colombia are committed by foreigners. The Interamerican Commission on Human Rights also reacted, asking Lopez and other public officials in Colombia to refrain from declarations that could "exacerbate xenophobia towards Venezuelans."
 Alfonso for her part says she is a "human and not a worm" in her latest song. And she disses Venezuelans who have broken local laws.
 "Some of my brothers have come here to do bad things. I'd like to beat them up with my stick," she sings. "I don't support that, that's a step backward. I'm just rapping to earn some pesos."

The physical appearance and build of the console are strong, especially when placed against its main rival, the PS5. The dark grey chassis works well in both vertical and horizontal orientation and I was able to easily integrate it into my entertainment furniture setup. The included cooling system sucks air up through the bottom of the frame and exhausts out the top with no issue. During my time evaluating the console, I never once noticed the sound of fans or anything else audible from the Series X. This is a welcome change from the Xbox 360 days and a real upgrade over the Xbox One, which had a tendency to sound like a hovercraft when asked to play demanding games. Time will tell how the Series X holds up in this regard.

New DelhiVisiting Sadar Bazaar ahead of Diwali gives an altogether different high. A nip in the air, festive vibes and the aroma of lip-smacking foods from almost every corner of the place makes the experience worthwhile. But this year, are you ready to step out and wade the pollution to reach this part of Old Delhi to procure lights to make your Diwali bright? Not many would say yes to this, due to the pandemic, and thus seeing the low footfall at this popular market, the shopkeepers have taken the virtual route. "I've made my Facebook page. And what I do is record and upload videos showing how to assemble strings of lights that reach people via home delivery."- Manpreet Singh, a shopkeeper in Sadar Bazaar To make up for the lost business due to Covid-19 situation, shopkeepers here have started accepting orders on call and even enabling home delivery of products through courier. But, above and beyond all this, these shopkeepers have taken the help of online channel to boost their sales. "I've made my Facebook page. And what I do is record and upload videos showing how to assemble strings of lights that reach people via home delivery," says Manpreet Singh, owner of Kuku Light House, adding, "There is awareness among people, not just about precautions related to Covid-19, but also about the need to support and buy Indian items. So, we create our own patterns, designs and even provide customised lights to those who are keen. This time as we start home delivery of lights, of course for orders that have a minimum of 10 items, we are also exporting our products outside India, and the response has been good." Singh explains how "all parts are delivered separately" and thus there is a need to learn how to assemble them. "Rather than plain textures, Madhubani, Marwari, and flower pattern lights are more in demand this year because of their appealing look. Some customers are also asking for metal and wooden lights. We try to revive old art by recreating wall hanging lights. And since we show how to do put all the bulbs and wires yourself, one of the MNC's in Jaipur got impressed and placed an order of 700 wooden lights, with their company name carved on it!" "Most of the bandarwals we have got from Ahmedabad. Despite stocking up on new designs and a huge variety, there are hardly any takers in the market this year." - Prahlad Yadav, a shopkeeper in Sadar BazaarWhile some have adapted to online ways of the trade, a few others are planning to follow suit, seeing the success in the medium. Prahlad Yadav, another shopkeeper in Sadar, who sells bandarwals and torans alongwith lights, says, "Most of our products are made in India. Most of the bandarwal we've, we got it from Ahmedabad. Despite stocking up on new designs and a huge variety, there are hardly any takers in the market this year. Due to strict Covid-19 precautions, customers are not turning up for the fear of being in a crowded place. Even the street hawkers are not allowed to set-up their stalls. So, I have now started talking to a few dealers who sell products online, and they have expressed that they are keep to collaborate with me, and help me sell my products via internet."It's also this reason why more online sellers can be spotted shopping in Sadar of late. "I'm not a direct seller. I pick up all the festive decor from Old Delhi, and then sell it to a second party that sells these products under a brand name on a website," says Priya Khoundal from Himachal Pradesh, who was visiting Sadar recently, and add, "I am not surprised to know that there is more online sale this year. This gives another reason to shopkeepers to think about the better prospects they have, if they partner with us. At least they will make a fair deal and not go down in losses this Diwali!"

The Job Retention Scheme, which was introduced alongside the national lockdown in March and helped keep a lid on unemployment, was due to expire at the end of October and to be replaced by a less generous program.
 However, it was reinstated on Saturday when the government abruptly announced another lockdown for England to last until Dec. 2. The lockdown, which formally came into force on Thursday, will see millions of workers going idle once again as it requires all non-essential venues such as pubs, restaurants, and stores selling items like books, clothing and sneakers, to close. The support package for self-employed workers was also made more generous.
 “I’ve always said I would do whatever it takes to protect jobs and livelihoods across the U.K. and that has meant adapting our support as the path of the virus has changed,” Sunak told lawmakers.
 “It’s clear the economic effects are much longer lasting for businesses than the duration of any restrictions, which is why we have decided to go further with our support.”
 The Bank of England said it expects the number of people on furlough to more than double in November to 5.5 million. At the height of the program in the spring, around 9 million workers, or around a third of the workforce, were on furlough.
 The government had for months balked at calls for an extension, arguing it wasn’t its role to support every job in the economy forever. It was no doubt also concerned about the cost of the program, which has reached 40 billion pounds.
 While welcoming the move, the main opposition Labour Party criticized Sunak for failing to act sooner, a delay that it says generated uncertainty and prompted some firms to dismiss staff in recent weeks. The government said the furlough scheme could be backdated so anyone who was on a payroll on Sept. 23 but then made redundant, can be re-employed.
 “This cycle of bluster, denial and then running to catch up is costing jobs and causing chaos,” said Labour’s economy spokeswoman, Anneliese Dodds.
 Though the furlough program prevented mass unemployment, the jobless rate has edged up from a four-decade low of 3.8% to 4.5%, with the likes of British Airways, Royal Mail and Rolls-Royce all laying off thousands.
 On Thursday, supermarket chain Sainsbury’s became the latest big company to announce hefty cuts. It will shed around 3,500 jobs as part of plans to permanently close its meat, fish and deli counters, as well as some of its Argos standalone stores.
 Given the outlook, the Bank of England expects the unemployment rate to rise to a peak of 7.75% in the second quarter of next year.
 Sunak’s latest change came after the Bank of England warned that the British economy is set for another downturn in the winter, with the economy forecast to contract a further 2% in the fourth quarter. It laid out the hope that a recession — widely defined as two straight quarters of contraction — may be avoided but said the outlook remains “unusually uncertain.”
 Given that backdrop, its nine-member policymaking panel agreed to increase the bank’s bond-buying program in an attempt to ensure banks carry on lending to the wider economy. The stimulus was bigger than the 100 billion pounds anticipated in financial markets.
 “We believe there is value in acting quickly and strongly to support the economy and avoid the risks of any short-term disruption,” Bank Governor Andrew Bailey told reporters.
 The Monetary Policy Committee also unanimously kept the bank’s main interest rate at the record low of 0.1%.

After the publication of the micro-lending consultation paper, Ma and the two top Ant executives were summoned to a rare joint meeting with four regulatory bodies.
 They were told that the company, notably its consumer-lending business, would face tougher scrutiny over matters including capital adequacy and leverage ratios.
 Regulators had been surprised by the scale and risk model of Ant's lending division, details of which were disclosed in the IPO-related filings since late August. The unit, which includes Huabei and short-term consumer loan provider Jiebei, contributed close to 40% of the group's revenue in the first half of the year.
 A day later, the Shanghai stock exchange said it had suspended Ant's IPO, citing a "significant change" in the regulatory environment, prompting the company to also freeze the Hong Kong leg of its dual listing.

Marlene Alfonso's nickname -- "Cindy sin Dientes" in Spanish -- comes from the fact that she is missing most of her teeth and she says she can't afford false ones."I'm trying to make something of myself," she sings while riding on a bus packed with commuters heading into downtown. "If you can't give me money, give me a kiss, that will fix my crooked neck."APMarlene Alfonso, a 69-year-old Venezuelan grandmother who goes by "Toothless Cindy," accepts coins from commuters. Marlene Alfonso, who calls herself ''Toothless Cindy," or "Cindy sin Dientes" in Spanish, is one of dozens of Venezuelan migrants who work on Bogota's public bus system every day, selling items like pens, or performing for tips.Her advanced age, comical lyrics and unusual attire for a rapper have helped her to stand out. She has become an inspiration for a group of migrants that has been mostly welcomed in Colombia, but has also suffered recently from discrimination and xenophobic attacks."Its tough to make a living here," says Haileen Volcan, a 32-year-old Venezuelan with five children, who sells puzzles for kids on Bogota's buses.
