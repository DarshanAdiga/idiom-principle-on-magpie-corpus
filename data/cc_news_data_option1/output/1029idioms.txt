At the same time though, I know that this is not the answer. Reduce, reuse, recycle. Recycling is always the last option in the waste-reduction hierarchy. I feel like I bang on about this a lot, but the message that it’s okay to just keep consuming at the rate we do so long as we recycle the waste is off the mark. Keep Australia Beautiful council reports that the world produces almost 20,000 single-use plastic bottles every second. By 2021 that number is expected to increase by 20%. Increase. Surely now is the time to be looking at ways to decrease the number of plastic bottles produced, even if it is from recycled materials? I feel like the government has a one-basket environmental policy and this is where all it’s eggs are.

I had plans, too. I was legitimately looking forward to covering Ole Miss spring football on Tuesday, and if I’m honest, I typically loathe spring football. We had a coverage plan and everything. I was going to make Chase cover it too, even if that meant sacrificing some midweek Ole Miss baseball coverage. People are excited about Lane Kiffin’s start at Ole Miss, and we were going to chronicle it to the best of our collective abilities.
 Ole Miss won’t practice football Tuesday. Or the next Tuesday. Or the Tuesday after that. Maybe, hopefully, the Rebels will squeeze some spring practices in before the end of the spring semester, but no one knows what’s next. Ole Miss, like Arkansas and damn near every other college in America, announced new plans Thursday. Ole Miss extended spring break another week and will go online only starting the following week for an indefinite amount of time. Some of Campbell’s friends at Ole Miss have spoken with and/or corresponded with their professors this week. To a person, everyone expects the remainder of the semester to play out online.
 What does that mean for football? I don’t know. I don’t think anyone really knows. We’re all in uncharted waters here.
 Baseball season, and all spring sports seasons, was suspended until March 30 earlier Thursday. That felt, at least to me, like a prayer. I know people in NBA and Major League Baseball circles and I knew what they were hearing — no sports, realistically, until mid-May. Hours later, in a move that shocked many and angered quite a few, the NCAA announced that all spring championships had been canceled. No March Madness, no Oklahoma City, no Omaha, no nothing. I wasn’t surprised. By noon Thursday, even before getting Campbell’s call, I was numb.
 Ole Miss baseball practiced Thursday. The Rebels were scheduled to entertain LSU starting tonight. Swayze was going to be crazy. The Tigers, of course, didn’t make the trip to Oxford. They stayed in Baton Rouge for one final day of classes before LSU, like everyone else, goes online only.
 Unless the Southeastern Conference goes renegade later this spring — and no one expects that — there won’t be anymore baseball at Swayze or Alex Box or Dudy Noble or Baum or anywhere else this season. In a moment, with a simple tweet, it was simply canceled.
 So, like I said, I’m driving to Fayetteville today. I’ll hang in a hotel room tonight while Campbell spends one more night with her friends. I’ll load her stuff in my truck and head back Saturday. I won’t have basketball games or spring training games to listen to. On Sunday, I won’t have a selection show to watch. On March 26, there won’t be any Major League Baseball games to view. The Cubs and Brewers won’t play as scheduled to open the 2020 season. In mid- April, the NBA Playoffs won’t begin.
 I suspect schools are going to get canceled or, at a minimum, postponed. I fear for businesses. I fear for people’s livelihoods, for retirement accounts and for our general sanity.
 I suspect I’ll spend a good amount of the drive back wondering what I’ll do now. There’s nothing to cover. I’ve never been a stick-to-sports guy, thank God, but I rely on sports as the canvas to do what I love. For the foreseeable future, there are no sports to write about or talk about. There are no games to analyze or predict. Everything is canceled.
 I suppose I’ll tell stories — my stories, your stories, anyone’s stories. I’ll do the one thing I always do when I don’t know what to do — write.
 Years ago, I started a book. I turned Campbell and Caroline’s stuffed animals into characters and brought them to “life.” Maybe now is the time to finish and refine that book. Years from now, when they have children, I suspect they’d read it fondly to my grandchildren, regaling them with tales of Larry the Leopard, Moses the Bear, Catherine the Elephant and the rest.
 At some point Saturday or Sunday, Campbell will pull away from Fayetteville and head home to Oxford. She’s loved her freshman year. She and her remarkable roommate, Parker, have the neatest friendship. They complement each other so well. Campbell has made other wonderful friends as well — in Fayetteville and New Orleans and Searcy and Nashville and Dallas and, yes, even in Iowa. She has thrived in the classroom and begun to get involved on campus. Arkansas has been a perfect fit. She chose it on her own. It was a great choice for her. It’s become home.
 I suspect Campbell will spend a lot of her drive hoping and praying that things get back to normal. She has plans. She wants to run for an office in her sorority, finalize a major, get an internship and enjoy her sophomore year. She is looking forward to another football season, another trip to Dallas for the Texas A&M game and the Ole Miss game so she can entertain some of her friends from home.
 Again, we’re all Campbell. Just like her, we’re all hoping and praying things eventually get back to our “normal” so we can resume doing the things we love and enjoy the places that make us feel home.
 Let’s hope we all get our wish. Let’s hope that on Nov. 14, we can all watch Ole Miss and Arkansas play a football game. Campbell can cheer for the Hogs. You guys can cheer for the Rebels and I can cheer for the clock. We can all have a few beers and some chicken tenders and bitch about the SEC officials. Let’s hope that by that day in northwest Arkansas, it just feels normal again.
 Even if it does, something tells me we’re all going to appreciate it more than we have in a long time.
 Until then, I’m going to try to remember that everyone out there is a lot like Campbell right now — sad, worried, scared and hopeful.
 My mother always says this, too, shall pass. I don’t have any other words of wisdom. I’ll just hope she’s right.

First, realize, understand and promote the value and vision of tourism. Understand that regardless of where you are in the scheme of things you must get to a point that you are doing things to grow tourism. This is the most important frame of mind community leaders can have when it comes to your community’s financial survival.
 Secondly, find those unique things about your city and build upon them. Tourists are seeking new and unique experiences, not sameness. Tourists are seeking to find the heart and soul of a community, not the same old and easy to find anywhere experiences so many provide. Does your community have access to water, such as rivers or lakes? Does your community have a niche such as music, history and/or art etc.? Find at least one niche and magnify that niche to the best of your ability.
 Thirdly, support organizations that are willing to create events that magnify your community’s niches and talents. People will travel for good events. Your events can be car or bike shows, food festivals, unique music festivals, veteran’s events, ethnic festivals and the list goes on. The real skill in this arena however is beyond just creating these events. Every event you concentrate community resources towards should be one that can ultimately grow to a multiday event. Those are the events that attract the high stakes tourism dollars that really make the impact your community needs.
 There is one additional element that can’t be overlooked as you begin to capitalize on these great events. That is your downtown appearance and ambiance. Tourists look for uniqness while visiting your town; they look for experiences that are unduplicated in other locations. As you build your event agenda in the coming years, don’t do so at the expense of neglecting the heart and soul of your downtown community. You need both to assure success. These two work hand in hand in growing and ultimately revitalizing your entire community.

The major challenge lies in finding ways to alleviate women’s fear of reporting violence, which is particularly strong in some areas of Palestine. We need to double our efforts and reach out to them, building trust and helping them confront and end the violence. The prevailing social culture is a major impediment to confronting gender-based violence because many segments of Palestinian society consider any activity that raises women’s awareness of violence as an incitement of women against men. They fear that their ‘edifice’ that is based on injustice and the violation of women’s rights may fall apart. Another impediment lies in the cantonization of the Palestinian territories through checkpoints, imposed by the occupation forces, that cut off remote areas and hinder our ability to access the women and marginalized communities that live in these areas. Our teams have faced many difficulties when trying to cross checkpoints.

This is Storyboard’s sixth production and their fourth English play. “Collessium Productions’ Preksha Trivedi has the rights for this play. It didn’t work out for them and offered the rights to us.” One of Tennessee Williams’s best works, the play opened in Broadway in 1947 and revolves around Blanche DuBois who visits her sister Stella, who is married to Stanley Kowalski in New Orleans. “Their lives take an unexpected turn with the arrival of Blanche, and what ensues is a roller-coaster ride of emotions and pretences,” he adds.
 Considering the play’s iconic status, Sandeep is a bit nervous but unfazed by the pressure. “I love the play for its characters; Everyone is a victim of circumstances. Our focus is to present it in a way that the audience understands every character’s perspective. Cultures might be different but our emotions are same. At the end of the day, if the audience are able to connect, our play has hit the right chord.”
 Once the actors were selected from different theatre groups, a reading session was held at Sandeep’s house at Gachibowli and the rehearsals continued at Phoenix Arena. The artistes were asked not to change the accent but to focus on correct pronunciation. In fact, Storyboard’s first play _Charlie’s Aunt_ was a Victorian era play. “Our English is good enough for the audience,” he smiles. Set and lighting designer Junaid Ullah conceptualised the set for the period drama and art director Suresh Mupoor executed it.
 Sandeep started his career by joining Samahaara’s acting workshop and worked as a stage manager for three years with different theatre groups. In 2015, he founded Storyboard Productions along with theatre actor David Jonas and Harika Velaga David. The team has made short films and also a film for police commissionerate for their initiatives in the IT corridor. “Storyboard is for those with an interest in any art form; be it poetry, storytelling or painting. We tell stories through different medium,” he says and adds, “We were anxious with the Corona news but surprisingly there was a slight surge in our ticket sales which encouraged us to go ahead with our show.”

By virtue of the fact that International Day for Women falls today, it is only fitting to extol the virtues of one of God's greatest gifts, if not the greatest gift to man in particular & to humanity in general. In medieval times, women were more often than not, regarded as second-class citizens, who were expected to serve their husbands hand & foot.Those times have since been buried in the limbo of forgotten things, with the skeletons not only biting the dust, but literally turning to dust in their entirety. We now live in different times, when past injustices towards the fairer sex, have since been chalked up to experiments gone horribly wrong. And we also live in an era, when women can exercise their rights; including the freedom of expression & movement, without let or hindrance. To get down to essentials: Regrettably, even at this point in time, when intolerance & discrimination towards women should be non-existent; vestiges of bigotry & male chauvinism emerge to the surface in dribs & drabs, reducing women to virtual irrelevance. And that is a crying shame, which needs to stop pronto. Hearteningly though, with the emergence of womens' emancipation movements & females securing positions of power in high, enviable places, the pendulum has swung full circle, giving women a place in the sun, a place which they so richly deserve. A woman's work is never complete. She is the glue which keeps the family together, when situations threaten to go pear-shaped. In the workplace, a woman at times faces sexual harassment from those finding it hard to control their biological urges; while turning a deaf ear to inappropriate, unsavoury remarks, with suggestive connotations. And this she does with dignity, tact & finesse, while suffering fools gladly, just to keep the peace. Women don't deserve to be publicly ridiculed Nor should they be taken for granted, under-valued, or used as door-mats.They are people with feelings, no different from their male counterparts.They are an integral part & parcel of creation, who need to be respected.

Outdoor parks will remain available for public use, but the reactivation of community water fountains and reopening of public restrooms will be delayed.
 As recently as Thursday, Catlett said that activities were expected to proceed as planned, and practice for spring inline hockey leagues even began that evening. However, Gov. Jim Justice’s Friday announcement of statewide school closings caused the MBCPR to follow suit.
 “You err on the side of safety,” Catlett said. “We were waiting on the mandate from the governor, and that came out today. When they closed schools indefinitely, that pushed it over the top and convinced us that we need to close down as well.”
 Catlett said that the suspensions will be in place for at least a few weeks, with the hope that the boys basketball playoffs and the spring sports schedule will eventually be able to resume.
 There is currently no cutoff point for when the suspensions would turn to cancellations. Catlett indicated that the reopening of schools and “life (going) back to normal” would be required for any resumption of activities.
 “I’ll be 67 in May, and it’s something I’ve never seen in my lifetime,” Catlett said. “It’s pretty crazy, but hopefully, it’s not the new norm. It’s been an a amazing couple of days.”

medical leave can be adopted.
 A paid medical leave policy of 12 weeks could cost as little as a third of a percentage point increase in payroll taxes — that’s about $90 per year for the average service occupation worker. Costs would be a fraction of that for a two-week sick leave policy — a small price to pay to ensure that we have proper social insurance policies in place to protect the long-term health and financial stability of all workers. Further, these costs are far lower than direct cash stimulus, which could cost about $350 billion per year. And paid sick and medical leave would solve the problem faster, provide more financial relief and job security, and better prevent future outbreaks.
 Furthermore, in order to help individuals who are out of work or who do not have steady incomes, immediate response could involve the government could subsidize the cost of testing and treatment for affected workers. In addition, it is necessary to expand programs like Unemployment Insurance, SNAP, Medicaid, and TANF by waiving time limits and work requirements when economic conditions deteriorate and unemployment increases, since the ability to engage in either training or work-related activity will likely be hindered. Ensuring that there will be no surprise medical billing for treatment and testing is also critical.
 The best stimulus package for now involves a multitude of options that can be phased in over time. First, devote a large chunk of federal, state and local money towards testing, treatment, and the development of vaccines to immediately address the coronavirus. These measures will keep Americans safe, slow the spread of COVID-19, and alleviate public concerns. Second, provide government-funded emergency paid sick and medical leave to all workers who need it, with job protection. Third, expand benefit programs and the safety net. Fourth, prepare for a cash stimulus in combination with an expanded EITC and targeted tax credits for businesses, further down the road, thus ensuring hiring and other expenses are not seriously impeded if the economy plunges further. Fifth, move towards a social insurance model for paid sick and medical leave so that future health crises can be contained right at the outset.

Algunas voces apuntaban recientemente que la globalización podría estar en retroceso, dadas las políticas proteccionistas de algunos países. El coronavirus evidencia claramente la interconexión (global) de nuestras economías a través de las cadenas de valor y lo complicado de deshacer la globalización. El efecto a través de las cadenas de valor globales viene dado por tres factores. Por una parte, los bajos niveles de stocks que mantienen las empresas, y que ahora, en momento de caída de la producción debida a las medidas de contención no pueden atender sus pedidos. En segundo lugar, la mayor dependencia hoy de la grandes multinacionales de plantas en China. Hoy China representa el 16% del PIB mundial frente al 4% en 2003, cuando surgió el SARS. China exporta el 40% de la ropa y el textil y el 16% del mobiliario del total mundial. Se estima que el crecimiento de China podría reducirse al 4,5% en el primer trimestre del año, y esto, dado su peso, sin duda tendrá incidencia sobre la economía global.

Las dos tienen una población inteligente y recursos naturales abundantes. Difieren en su sistema político y su cultura y es por eso que el paralelo entre ellas resulta enigmático y su análisis desafiante.      Después de China, el otro estado gigante es la India y si las medimos por población, según los pronósticos la alcanzará en dos años. Son unos 1.370 millones los que allí viven, en 3.287 km2. Se trata del quinto territorio nacional más extenso de la tierra, con una densidad de población de unas 415 personas por km2.      La India tiene una larga y rica cultura e historia y sus primeros vestigios se remontan a unos 3.000 AC. A través del tiempo sufrió importantes invasiones, como la de los persas, Alejandro Magno, los otomanos, los mogoles y otros intrusos.      Más cerca de nuestros tiempos, en el siglo XVIII, Gran Bretaña (GB) venció a los franceses que tenían una importante presencia en el subcontinente, que no pudieron retener ya que el dominio de los mares lo tenían los ingleses y les cortaban sus suministros y comunicaciones. Paulatinamente, Gran Bretaña convirtió al subcontinente en su Virreinato. El monarca británico se convirtió en emperador soberano de la India.      Su dominio sobre este vasto territorio comenzó a flaquear después de la Primera Guerra Mundial, cuando surgió un movimiento independentista encabezado por Mahatma Gandhi, un extraordinario líder pacifista quien blandiendo su arma de resistencia no violenta y su mensajes de paz, terminó (durante el gobierno Laborista en GB) con la ocupación colonial, al finalizar la Segunda Guerra Mundial.      Podríamos decir que en 1947 empieza la era moderna de esta gran nación, cuando los ingleses se retiran y casi en simultáneo tiene lugar una cruenta partición o secesión, con tremendos desplazamientos humanos producto de la latente incompatibilidad religiosa existente entonces (y también ahora) entre musulmanes e hindúes, más que por diferencias étnicas. Las emboscadas, los asaltos a trenes repletos de desdichados, las matanzas de unos y otros a lo largo de las nutridas columnas de familias que huían buscando refugio, habiendo abandonado sus casas, dejaron un saldo de más de 200.000 muertos, aunque se cree que la cifra real fue bastante mayor y el saldo en miseria y pobreza, enorme.      Raja del subcontinente, se dividió eventualmente en varios países, siendo ellos actualmente la India, Pakistán al noroeste y Bangladesh y Mantra (Birmania) al noreste y podríamos agregar también Sri Lanka (antes Ceylán), la gran isla y estado al sureste, que un tiempo dependió políticamente del virreinato aunque con una administración separada.      Surgió entonces la India como la conocemos hoy, la democracia parlamentaria más grande del mundo, con el importante legado que dejó GB de su tradición legal, administrativa y su idioma unificante. Según la constitución, la India es una democracia, socialista, federal y secular pero estos preceptos se han ido modificando. El socialismo se ha ido flexibilizando y parcialmente descartando en vista de los magros resultados económicos que esta práctica ideológica trae como consecuencia.      Tampoco se ha avanzado mucho en compatibilizar la convivencia religiosa y en ese rubro existe un serio y desestabilizante déficit. El actual Primer Ministro ha promulgado legislación obligando a los habitantes de la India a justificar su nacionalidad. La ciudadanía es concedida fácilmente a todos menos a los musulmanes (13% de la población o unos 180 millones de personas) muchos de los cuales no logran reunir las pruebas de ciudadanía de sus ancestros que les exige la burocracia gubernamental, creando una masa de apátridas, sin derechos, acceso al trabajo, sujetos a deportaciones, expropiaciones y otros abusos.      Difícil labor será sacarle la espoleta al complejo intríngulis religioso. Un amigo indio me lo explicó en estos términos: "Ellos, los hindúes, adoran la vaca a la que consideran sagrada. Nosotros (los musulmanes) la comemos, con todo lo que ello implica". Su economía, especialmente desde que comenzó su liberalización, ha aumentado su crecimiento a tasas del 5/6% del PBI, pero desde una base baja y está lejos del capitalismo que ha propulsado la China. Mientras esta última bajó drásticamente su tasa de natalidad, la India lo hace lentamente. El crecimiento de la población de China, en los últimos 20 años es en promedio, dos veces menor al de India, por lo tanto el per cápita "incoe" se ha distanciado seriamente uno del otro. Según el FMI, en 2019 el PBI per cápita de China fue de US$ 10.098 y el de la India solo US$ 2.171. Si bien las políticas de desarrollo económico chinas han resultado en una mayor desigualdad social, esto es inevitable si se sueltan ciertas riendas. Los más emprendedores y los que asumen más riesgos con éxito, acumularán riqueza y capital que luego invierten, ahorran o gastan, haciendo mover la economía.      Pero el punto central de lo que sucede en India actualmente, es el sectarismo. La discriminación que promueve Narendra Modi el PM y su partido (BJP) para satisfacer el descontento y opacar su mediocre desempeño (comparado por ej. con China), maquillando y apelando a los bajos instintos. Como se ha visto en el mundo, no es necesario demasiado aliento para convertirlos en hoguera. La libertad y la democracia, por primera vez en estos 75 años parecen estar en peligro.      Con todos sus defectos y virtudes la India era un país inclusivo, amable y tolerante y si bien hubo en el pasado momentos sangrientos o de tensión, con magnicidios incluidos, las cosas luego se calmaban. Hoy el gobierno parece hacerse eco de la idea de que los musulmanes y luego los cristianos dominaron India durante demasiados años y ahora llegó el tiempo de los hindúes.

To the younger generation, the name of Chris Greet may not ring a bell. But to those who were around in the early eightees or thereabouts, they will remember Christopher Arthur Greet, affectionately called & known as Chris, as one of, if not the most respected radio personality; who strode the hallowed corridors of showbiz with aplomb. Chris was the complete package. He was an announcer, who was one of the strongest linchpins of one of the most popular radio stations in South Asia; Radio Ceylon. Among his contemporaries were Jimmy Barucha, Tim Haushington, Livy Wijemanne, Greg Roswoski, Vernon Corea, Wijeya Corea & Leon Belleth, among others. All of the above, were stalwarts in their own right, who brought happiness into the lives of many; with some of them gaining solace, from the music the disc jockeys dished out from their turn tables, at that point in time; as did Chris, who was very much a significant part of the equation. Despite been relatively slightly-built, Chris was packed with energy, not to mention bubbling over with creativity & enthusiasm. Many wannabe announcers & others, keen in making it big in the industry, cut their teeth under the tutelage of this charismatic personality. Chris was never one, who was satisfied in hiding his light under a bushel. Nor did he think twice, before agreeing to impart his valuable know-how to his students; a know-how others yearned to know how. Chris enjoyed iconic status in the Radio Industry. It will be no exaggeration to say, that he was the catalyst for Radio Ceylon becoming the envy of broadcasting, not only in Ceylon ( as it was then known) but in many other countries where Chris excelled & where he was recognised. Deciding to spread his wings, Chris secured employment as an account director at Intisel Advertising, located at 60 Green Path Colombo 7. He later recorded commercials from Sri Lankan advertising agencies back in the 1980's. Among his earlier roles as an actor, in which he distinguished himself; was portraying the role of a British officer in the unforgettable epic movie "Bridge on the River Kwai", a timeless classic which has & continues being the envy of many a film producer, or any person associated with the industry. Needless to say, Chris' dedicated & impeccable performance, proved to be a cut above the rest. He also appeared alongside some of the greatest stage actors, vis-a-vis Lucien de Zoysa, to name just one, among a host of others. Chris was also an accomplished mimic, who imitated the chirping of birds & other animals, in a special programme which was given considerable airplay at the time, to the unrestrained delight of both kids & adults alike. He was also a music director who produced the song "Dreamworld", a song written by Desmond "Des" Kelly, who happened to be one of Sri Lanka's most sought-after, multi-talented musicians & one who is still respected & revered. Now in the winter of his life, this once-effervercent showman, spends his days in a nursing home in England; cared for by one of Florence Nightingale's angels. Albeit ravaged by the debiltating effects of acute dementia; Chris has rare moments of lucidity; in that, he remembers the lyrics of "Dreamworld". His eyes light up & he comes alive, the moment he listens to the recording. Such is the power of music. And such is the magic of Des Kelly's voice & the enduring popularity of the song, which has hitherto not lost its lustre! We wish Chris Greet the very best which life can offer!

TALK about being careful what you wish for: by the time this week’s Champions League action was unfolding, I’m sure I wasn’t the only outside observer left equal parts baffled and dismayed by the fact that the UK authorities felt it was acceptable for Anfield to play host to a full house for Liverpool against Atletico while, at the very same time in Paris, PSG were hosting Borussia Dortmund in an empty Parc des Princes.
 At home, we all know that football’s shut-down is going to pose severe challenges for the domestic game and for the FAI, especially if, as is widely expected, the prohibition will need to be extended beyond March 29.
 But, in the context of what is now the most urgent priority world-wide, there is growing evidence that, though there are still varying rates of catch-up being played in the bid to halt the spread of Covid-19, almost all of football is finally arriving on the same page in realising that our individual and collective health must take precedence over every other consideration.
 And while the proverb has it that all good things must come to an end, we shouldn’t lose sight of the fact that all bad things do too.

Pelosi negotiated the deal with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in days of around-the-clock negotiations with cross-town phone calls, even as Trump was speaking at the White House.
 Voting in the Senate is not yet set, with senators out of town for the weekend. But Senate Leader Mitch McConnell cancelled a plan recess week and senators were scheduled to return Monday. He said he expects most senators will want to “act swiftly.”
 Both Mnuchin and Pelosi, who said she did not speak directly to Trump during the negotiations, promised a third coronavirus package will follow soon, with more aggressive steps to boost the U.S. economy, which economists fear has already slipped into recession.
 The financial markets closed on an upswing after one of the worst nosedives since the 1987 downturn.
 For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.
 The vast majority of people recover. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to be over it.
 Trump said he was gratified that Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro tested negative for the virus, after the pair sat next to each other for an extended period of time last weekend at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club. A senior aide to Bolsonaro tested positive.
 The White House physician said in a memo late Friday that Trump was also exposed to a second guest at the club dinner, "sharing the table with the president," who has since tested positive for the virus. Still despite the incidents, the physician said Trump had only “LOW risk” interactions and testing "is not currently indicated.”
 Trump's daugher, Ivanka Trump, worked from home Friday after meeting with Australian Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton, now in isolation at a hospital after testing positive for the coronavirus. White House spokesman Judd Deere said she was evaluated by the White House Medical Unit.
 Attorney General William Barr, who also met with the Australian official, stayed home Friday, though he “felt great and wasn't showing any symptoms,” according to his spokeswoman Kerri Kupec.
 Several lawmakers, including some close to Trump, have also been exposed to people who tested positive for the virus, and are self-isolating.
 Among them are Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham and Rick Scott, who were at Trump’s club on the weekend. Graham announced Friday that he also met with the Australian official who has now tested positive. And GOP Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who had previously isolated himself after a potential exposure at a conservative conference in Washington, said Friday he met with a Spanish official and is now self-quarantining.
 Hospitals welcomed Trump’s emergency declaration, which they and lawmakers in Congress had been requesting. It allows the Health and Human Services Department to temporarily waive certain federal rules that can make it harder for hospitals and other health care facilities to respond to an emergency.
 The American Medical Association said the emergency declaration would help ensure America's health care system has sufficient resources to properly respond to the ongoing outbreak.
 Dr. Anthony Fauci, infectious disease chief at the National Institutes of Health, said more tests would be available over the next week, but warned, “We still have a long way to go.”

All the coaches helped with the hitting with Southcott focused on infielders and the pitching staff.
 “Defensively I worked with our middle infielders a lot and I worked with all of our pitchers coming through the system as well cause in college all I did was pitch,” Southcott said.
 When he began helping the Tigers he quickly realized that the team one he could see himself being the head coach of in the future.
 “That first year under Coach Wilburn that really convinced me that I wanted to take over the program eventually in the future,” Southcott said.
 One of the main factors that enticed Southcott was the facilities that the high school has access to. The Tigers’ home field is Hunnicutt Field which also hosts the Princeton Rays in the summer who are the Rookie-level affiliate of the Tampa Bay Rays.
 “First of all we have the best facilities in the state in my opinion,” Southcott said. “We have one of the nicest fields and one of the nicest hitting facilities that any high school program could ask for and obviously that’s enticing to me.”
 It was not just the facilities that attracted Southcott to take the job but the players that are on the team. The seniors this year were sophomores when Southcott began as an assistant coach.
 “Just seeing the kind of guys we had, they’re great kids, great people and just Princeton being pretty much a home for me all those kind of factored into why I wanted to take over the program.”
 Southcott will have to wait for his first game in charge as State Superintendent W. Clayton Burch announce Friday that spring sports will not be allowed to practice or play games for four weeks. The decision will be re- evaluated at that time.
 Princeton was scheduled to open the season March 18 against Bluefield at Hunnicutt Field.

The reality of where we are at with the spread of the virus is that the most uninformed commentator can now posit all kinds of worst-case scenarios in relation to its impact on sport and, given time — and not a whole lot, at that — he or she probably won’t be too far wide of the mark.
 UEFA have convened a video conference crisis meeting of associations, leagues, clubs and player representatives for Tuesday, at which they say “discussions will include all domestic and European competitions, including Euro 2020.”
 Again, you don’t need to be a fly on the wall of the inner sanctum in Nyon to predict that official confirmation of a postponement of the tournament is imminent and that those discussions will mainly concern the complicated mechanics involved in pushing it back a year, along with the related issues of how to manage the play-offs and the completion of this season’s club competitions.
 All based on the assumption, of course, that at some uncertain point in hopefully the not too distant future, things will get better but only, it seems clear, after they’ve gotten worse.
 It was in what now feels like the very distant past — December 2012 to be precise — that the then UEFA General Secretary, Gianni Infantino was exulting in the ambitious plan to mark 60 years of the European Championships by spreading the tournament in eight years’ time across 12 different countries (with Ireland, of course, later to claim one of the hosting rights).

 Their 15 employees have taken on added responsibility — though that has been offset somewhat by a 50% decline in business due to the virus, said the 38-year-old Chi.
 “I have to organize the company and the family to work together to solve this,” he said.
 The hardest thing, he said, was the disruption to the children’s schedules. They are sad at home, missing their friends, struggling to focus on online homework and their teachers’ video lessons.
 But he believed the closures were appropriate because the outbreak “is becoming more and more complex. At this time, closing [schools] will be better.”
