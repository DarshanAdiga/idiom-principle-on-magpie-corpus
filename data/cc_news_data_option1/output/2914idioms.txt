By the same token, tagging Biden as a supporter of “defunding” could further the Trump campaign’s overall effort to portray the former vice president as a captive of his party’s left.
 The evidence so far shows no sign of success for that backlash tactic. Convincing the public that Biden is a radical is a challenging task, especially after the Democratic left spent 2019 berating him as too conservative. And the fact that a large share of the public, including even many of his supporters, see Trump as a liar, makes it even harder for him to sell such a case.
 But for Trump, far behind in the polls and continuing to slide, a long-shot gamble may be his best remaining bet.

But there’s an important caveat that shapes the politics of the issue: The change in white attitudes has not occurred across the board.
 In the ABC/Washington Post poll, for example, three-quarters of white Democrats said that Black residents in their communities faced discrimination. Among Republicans, it was 29%.
 Similarly, an NBC/Wall Street Journal survey, also released this week, found 72% of white Democrats, but 19% of white Republicans, said that racism was “built into U.S. institutions.” Asked if Black Americans face discrimination, 89% of white Democrats said yes, just 25% of white Republicans agreed.
 Indeed, among white Republicans more said that white people faced discrimination, 30%, than said Blacks did.

It begins with “The 1,” a stoic look back at a fizzled romance, which moves at a lope, nudged along by ringing piano chords and one of the album’s sprightlier beats. Nearly all the songs on “Folklore” are ballads, and the chamber pop arrangements favored by Dessner and Swift’s longtime collaborator Jack Antonoff, who co-produced six songs, give the songs a spooky sheen, a sound both ghostly and gleaming. In “Epiphany,” a song that begins _in medias res_ during a World War II battle and shifts to what may be a scene from the COVID-19 pandemic (“Holds your hand through plastic now”), synths, strings and brass groan and swoop around Swift’s melancholy croon. “My Tears Ricochet,” which is narrated from beyond the grave, builds to a tumultuous climax, with church choir backing vocals rising over shuddering drums. It’s goth, like Chartres Cathedral is goth.

Second Stimulus Check: What to Expect in GOP Plan Before Release

President Donald Trump and Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos are like football coaches on the sideline screaming at concussed players to sprint back onto the field or else they'll lose their spot on the team.
 Trump and DeVos insist that shell-shocked schools and universities get back in the game by reopening fully for in-person classes in the fall — or lose federal funding.
 The directive recklessly disregards the spiking threat of the coronavirus pandemic. Through last Sunday, at least 40,000 new cases had been registered nationwide every day this month. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, another record was set a week ago Friday with 74,710 new cases.
 While Illinois hasn't experienced the same degree of COVID-19 surge engulfing many areas of the country, the virus has spiked and continues to pose a dire threat. On Wednesday, the state reported 1,598 new cases, the largest one-day confirmed count since June 2.
 The coronavirus spreads readily indoors among crowds. Schools could be like a Petri dish for the virus.
 School administrators can take measures to reduce the risk of infection outbreaks, such as mandatory face masks, frequent cleaning of surfaces and forbidding students to drink directly from water fountains.
 But many corridors, classrooms, lunch rooms and other facilities — not to mention school buses — are too small to enforce social distancing if all students return.

__Summary__ _: The lethal mistake of Ethiopia’s celebrated PM Abiy Ahmed has been to place his prosperity party’s (PP) ‘Medemer’ view ahead of his country’s peaceful and orderly democratic transition_ _to give it its best chance of success_ _._ _Instead, he appears to have deprioritized the transition’s success in favor of becoming the next in a long line of Ethiopian king of kings. He talks the talk of religious based Medemer “Philosophy” without walking the talk in practice. This has led to many of his other wrongdoings. His debilitated action deters democratic transition and peace in Ethiopia. Medemer isn’t homebased, isn’t synergy, isn’t indigenous or isn’t a new thought. It is plagiarized from religious based American Property Gospel, an umbrella term for a group of ideas popular among various preachers that equate Christian faith with material, and particularly with financial success. Abiy copied a nineteenth-century spiritual movement in America but pasted to a twenty-first century Ethiopia’s social-political situation._

MGH: Well, what happened was that "Genius" got shut down and we had already finished shooting. We were in the can ready to go. So it kind of made sense that we would go now. I think serendipitously, it's a story about survival against all odds and their struggle for survival was against everything hostile in the environment. I think people draw some correlation right now, to how we come together as a community, etc. I try not to stretch it too far because I feel like all the concerns are universal concerns. All the desires are universal desires and any human desire and human emotion and human struggle is timeless. We're still going through the same struggles now that we went through then. We just have washing machines instead of wringing them out of the pole, right? So they decided once "Genius" wasn't going to be able to go because they got shut down, they decided to move us up. And I think what happened… I mean there's nothing adverse, it's all great, it's just that we didn't really have time to prepare audiences to do the little bits of press. So this is just amazing. I'm glad we're getting to do it because I think we want to raise people's awareness level of what's coming.

SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (AP) — A Springfield, Missouri, woman is suing the city over its decision to require face coverings, saying the health of others “is not my responsibility.” Rachel Shelton is asking the court to temporarily stop an ordinance, and to rule that it violates her rights. The Springfield law follows a big spike in new confirmed cases of the coronavirus in southwestern Missouri and across the state. “Your health is not my responsibility,” Shelton said at a news conference Thursday, according to the Springfield News-Leader. “Your emotional well-being is not my responsibility.” Springfield, Missouri's third-largest city, is among several jurisdictions in the state that have begun requiring face coverings in many public places. Confirmed COVID-19 cases have risen sharply since Republican Gov. Mike Parson allowed the state to reopen for business in mid-June. A new record for a single day was set Tuesday. That record was broken on Wednesday, and that record was topped Thursday when the state health department announced 1,637 new confirmed cases. The state also has recorded 1,179 deaths since the pandemic began. The number of infections is thought to be far higher because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected with the virus without feeling sick. Shelton's attorney, Kristi Fulnecky, said Springfield's ordinance violates Shelton’s right to privacy under the Fourth Amendment and freedom of expression and religion under the First Amendment because she “does not want to be required to wear face coverings during church worship” or in businesses. Fulnecky also said the ordinance that took effect last week is overly broad and violates due process. The Springfield ordinance requires people older than 11 to wear a...
