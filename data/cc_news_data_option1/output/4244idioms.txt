If talks stop until after the election, it could be February until they begin again, the caucus noted. So it's encouraging the Trump administration to include a national testing strategy in the next relief bill, as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) pushed for. And it wants McConnell to take a vote on the House and White House's proposal. Without these measures, families and businesses "will continue to suffer needlessly as a result of Congress failing to do its job," the caucus said.

Junior quarterback Hunter Mortimer has led the Indians  this season with 1179 total yards (548 passing, 631 rushing) and 21 touchdowns (11 passing, 10 rushing). Mortimer's 11 passing scores have occurred in only 28 pass attempts.             "He's just a tough kid," Haveman said. "He's always had the natural vocal leader attribute. He just loves the sport. He's easy to coach and really receptive to what we say. He never has to be told to play harder.             The Indians are now shifting their attention towards a deep playoff run, which they hope begins Thursday against Freeman. Weeping Water and Freeman played in week one, which Weeping Water won 40-8.             "They're a good team and a good program," Haveman said. "You should have to play well to win in the playoffs. That's what we will have to do Thursday."             Like every other game this year, Haveman feels the key for his team starts in the trenches.             "We'll have to win the battle up front," he said. "If we can be physical, push people back and hold the line of scrimmage, we are going to be successful. If we can win the battle up front, we can run the ball and pass the ball when we want to."            Freeman/Weeping Water is slated for a 7 p.m. kickoff.

In what was a friendly and competitive encounter, Gerry Binmore edged out Paul Hilder on the first extra hole to go through to the semi-finals. Well, the flags must be at half-mast in Oman where Paul worked before his return to his Seaton roots, but he gave his all and can take comfort that he beat the defending champion in his previous round. Paul won the opening hole with a fine birdy but then lost the next. The pair were then neck-and-neck all the way to the 16th where Gerry went one up only for Paul to immediately level things up again on the 17th. They both bogeyed the last which took the contest back to the first to see if they could find a winner. Not surprisingly, they both found the rough; Paul on the right and Gerry on the left. Both hacked out, but Gerry then chipped stone dead to win - that's not cricket in my book! Gerry will now meet the winner of the quarter-final between Simon Wellington (13) and Stuart Mackie (10) which is due to be played this Thursday (October 22). No tickets for this one and so it's a case of virtual crowds but, as they say with 'Strictly' \- it's going to be a belter - I promise!

Last year's captain Jill Wellington came third with 28 points. The ladies are now looking forward to taking on the Seniors in the annual Tic Toc trophy that is being played this week.

It's clear Greg and Kelly Vandagriff would support their three high-school- aged children regardless of their extracurricular interests, but it's also clear they're both happy the kids have opted to pursue athletics.
   
 "Sports is just something that we do but it doesn't identify us," said Greg, whose Prince Avenue Christian Wolverines - ranked No. 2 in Class A Private - will host top-ranked Athens Academy at 7:30 p.m. Friday in what will no doubt be one of the state's most-watched games of the weekend.
   
 "We're just as concerned and interested as to how they do in the classroom and who their friends are and how they develop as human beings. We're thankful and blessed that they're good in sports, but that doesn't identify who we are."
   
 "We weren't sure what we would do with children who weren't interested in sports," added Kelly, who is director of education support services at Prince Avenue. "We had big plans for them before they even came along, and that was fun. We understood they might not be interested in sports and we'd have to live in a whole new world and we would have and loved it and supported them anyway.
   
 "We knew we wanted them all together. We knew we wanted some good Wiffle ball games and kickball games in the front yard - we put a lot of thought into this. We wanted our children to grow up with similar interests and age levels. We're very blessed. It worked out wonderfully for us and now we have three busy teenagers."
   
 Those three teenagers aren't just busy - there also quite proficient in their respective sports. Brock, 18 and a senior, was one of the most sought-after prep quarterbacks in the country before signing with Georgia; Anna Greer, 17 and a junior, is an excellent volleyball player and was named to the Banner- Herald's 2019 all-area volleyball team; and freshman Audrey, 14, has already made an impression this fall on the Wolverines' softball team and is expected to play basketball and run track, too.
   
 Both Greg and Kelly played sports at the collegiate level - Greg played football at Tennessee Wesleyan and began coaching some three decades ago at Tennessee Tech and Kelly played softball and volleyball on the JUCO level, although she said her kids tease her that it "doesn't count" - and the two met when both were teachers and coaches at Wheeler High School in Marietta.
   
 Not surprisingly, Greg and Kelly's children got their first taste of sports at an early age, and thus their education began.
   
 "We wanted them to play sports and we felt it was important to play team sports because you learn to share and sacrifice and you learn things that you need to succeed in life," said Greg. "And we've been very sports-minded."
   
 'The Vandagriff Olympics'
   
 Suffice it to say, with three elite athletes under the same roof, there's a considerable competitive spirit simmering in the household. During the recent quarantining taking place in the advent of the novel coronavirus pandemic, the Vandagriff children spent a lot of time around each other, and even staged "The Vandagriff Olympics" over the summer.
   
 "We had five different events," said Anna Greer of the familial Olympiad. "I think I won three of the five events, including bb-gun target shooting and basketball and volleyball. I'd say I was the winner, but I don't know what they would say."
   
 "Everything is a game and you don't want to come in last in anything," said Brock, who also played baseball and basketball and ran track before focusing on football. "We used to race up and down the stairs and play foursquare and knockout in the back yard. It's almost like you're fighting for everything trying to get to first. I think it's helped Audrey and Anna a lot being competitive with each other. It's fun and it keeps you on your toes."
   
 The rivalries between the Vandagriffs aren't restricted to sports, however.
   
 "We're always competing against each other," said Audrey. "During the quarantine we'd play basketball and come in fighting because of who won and who lost. And we play board games and always end up fighting because we're so competitive. I love it."
   
 Team Vandagriff
   
 Things can get pretty heated at home, but beyond the homestead exists an entity in which the members support one another unconditionally.
   
 "None of them are a threat to the others' identities, and we should be supporting each other and we should be there for each other and we should celebrate successes and feel their pain in defeat," said Greg. "They've embraced that and they all do a great job. Their mom does a wonderful job with that."
   
 "My dad always told us we're always one big group, we're always Team Vandagriff," said Anna. "And we're always competing against everybody else. We've always supported each other - Brock comes to a lot of my games and it means a lot to me to see my brother and sister in the stands supporting me. And I do the same for them as well."
   
 The emptying nest
   
 In January, Brock will enroll at Georgia and begin his life away from home (Kelly and Greg both said that their son is making regular announcements as to when he'll be departing). Anna is just a year behind and is likely to have a chance to play volleyball at the next level. It won't be long - the blink of an eye in some cases - and the Vandagriff nest will be empty.
   
 "You always keep that in the back of your head once they get into high school you do start looking at those 'lasts' and it does put things in perspective," said Kelly. "I do start to cherish those moments around the dinner table a little more. I'm a stickler about making dinner with the family a priority. It's always been that way. Every year we lose more time and we don't have dinners as often as I like, but I do find myself very thankful those times we are around the table, just listening a little bit more."
   
 "Kelly and I kid and joke, wondering what it's going to be like one year, two years and four years from now," said Greg. "We wonder what we'll do with our free time when we're not at a ballpark or flying to St. Louis for volleyball or something like that.
   
 "It's so hectic in the fall I don't think any of us have taken much time to think about in a certain number of weeks, Brock will be gone. But he does remind us of that. We haven't sat down and thought about it. Life gives you things you continue to adapt to. Your kids growing up and going to college is something you embrace."
   
 "It got here a lot faster than I thought," said Brock. "I've heard from every senior and they say it goes by fast. It hasn't gone by fast until now…Time flies and it won't be long until I'm there."

Le groupe entend egalement revoir son modele de distribution et de commercialisation en Europe, ce qui pourrait entrainer la fermeture de son centre de distribution europeen situe a Rugby au Royaume-Uni, precise le responsable. Autre option mise sur la table, le transfert d'activites a des "tiers interesses dans le cadre d'un projet d'expansion du modele de partenariat", au travers de franchises qui constituent "un moyen efficace et rentable d'amplifier la marque". "Grace a la franchise, la marque Gap atteint des clients dans 35 pays avec plus de 400 magasins et 14 sites de commerce electronique", precise le groupe. Le groupe, affecte comme l'ensemble du secteur de la mode par les fermetures liees aux mesures de confinement a travers le monde, comptait 129 magasins Gap en Europe au debut du mois d'aout.

Just in time for the release of the iPhone 12, giffgaff has launched its first 5G-ready goodybag. So provided you have a 5G phone and have 5G coverage, you can enjoy faster speeds and lower latency. And unlike the "always on" packages, there are no limits on your usage.View Deal
            You also get unlimited calls and texts, plus the freedom to cancel or change your plan at any time. So while giffgaff’s unlimited goodybag is more expensive than some networks charge, you’re not locked in for one to two years. It’s also still cheaper than some networks try to charge.            Of course giffgaff still offers what it calls "Always On data" as part of the £25 goodybag, that wasn’t unlimited. That plan gives you 80GB of full speed data, after which your speeds were throttled to 384 kbps between 8 a.m. and midnight. While you can still browse (slowly), and check emails etc, it’s not fast enough to do much else of note. The unlimited plan has no such restrictions.            All you have to do is abide by the fair usage policy, which tells you not to tether to more than 11 devices at a time, and not use "unreasonable amounts of data". The small print mentions using more than 650GB a month more than twice in a six month period, but notes that infractions aren’t limited to this. Honestly, they’re not particularly unreasonable terms, so don’t try and exploit them because you’ll just spoilt it for everyone.            The sale page doesn’t seem to include the unlimited goodybag right now, but don’t fret because it will turn up eventually.

This column is reprinted with permission from Boston Globe columnist Kevin Cullen. It originally ran in The Boston Globe on Sept. 27, 2016.            It all started last May, over a plate of fried clams at a restaurant in the Back Bay.                John Butterworth and Steve Gaziano had taken Travis Roy out for dinner, just to catch up. Butterworth and Gaziano are hockey guys, and if there is one group of people who have never forgotten Travis Roy, it's hockey guys.                Twenty-one years ago, Travis Roy was 11 seconds into his first shift for Boston University when he went down along the boards and couldn't get up. He was 20 years old, a quadriplegic. He has spent the last two decades giving comfort to those who have suffered similar fates, raising millions for research, providing wheelchairs and other hardware to those who need to adapt after a catastrophic injury.            That night over fried clams, the three men got to talking about what they wanted to do during the summer.            "What I would really like to do," Travis Roy said, "and what I haven't been able to do since I got injured, is go fishing, on the ocean."            Butterworth and Gaziano looked at each other and immediately thought the same thing: Carl Cavossa.                Cavossa, Butterworth, and Gaziano have been fishing together out of Falmouth for a quarter-century. They don't have to be asked twice to go fishing.                "We'll go fishing off the Vineyard on Carl's boat," Butterworth said, and Gaziano nodded. Done deal.                Travis Roy appreciated what Gaziano and Butterworth were proposing, but he didn't believe for a minute they'd be able to get him on a small fishing boat. There was that little matter of him being attached to a 600-pound motorized wheelchair.                But Gaziano and Butterworth knew if anybody could figure it out, it's Carl Cavossa.                Cavossa's business is disposal and excavating. He has the brain of an engineer and the brawn of a wrestler. He asked Roy to send him the wheelchair's dimensions. Then he welded together a metal cage, the size of a witness box. Roy steered his wheelchair into the cage, and Cavossa used an old Army surplus crane to lift and lower him and the wheelchair onto the back of his boat, the Play Penn.                Getting Travis Roy onto the boat didn't turn out to be the problem. Finding bait was the problem. There was a dearth of pogies. Nobody on the Cape had pogies. Cavossa explained to a couple of fishermen he needed pogies because he was bringing Travis Roy fishing.                "You mean that kid from BU?" a fisherman who goes by the nickname Hairball asked.                Cavossa nodded.                Hairball found 50 pogies in no time. When Cavossa tried to pay Hairball, he wouldn't take the money. The word went out among fishermen all around Falmouth and soon Cavossa had 100 pogies. No one would take Cavossa's money.                At the fuel dock, the guy pumping gas asked Cavossa if he could talk to Travis. The guy explained that his friend's son had been paralyzed in an accident two weeks before. The guy huddled with Travis, who promised to help.                Roy's father, Lee, came onboard, as did Butterworth's 10-year-old son Jack, Gaziano's 11-year-old son Joe, and Cavossa's sons, Nick, 15, and Sam, 14.                The boat was cruising near the Elizabeth Islands, north of Martha's Vineyard, when Cavossa looked down from the captain's chair to see Sam lifting a bottle to Travis Roy's lips so he could drink some water. Nick broke up a chocolate chip cookie so Travis could eat it more easily.            Steve Gaziano had volunteered to be the chum man. He cut the pogies into bits, dropping them off the back of the boat to attract the fish. The kids clamored for jelly doughnuts, the slang for the gooey midsection of a pogie.                "Jelly doughnuts are the best bait," Jack Butterworth confided to Travis.                "I believe you," Travis replied.                But the jelly doughnuts weren't working. Cavossa moved the boat around, like a dog sniffing for something.                "I've got an idea," he yelled down from the captain's chair.                As the boat sped toward the Vineyard, bits of surf flew onboard, like pelting rain drops. The boys and Lee Roy took turns drying off Travis's glasses. Cavossa stopped just west of Nomans Land, an uninhabited island off the Vineyard.                The stripers began striking immediately. With rapid succession, the kids pulled in stripers and black bass, one after another. Jack Butterworth landed a beauty, a 36-inch striper. He got it off the hook, then brought it over so Travis could feel the scales on his cheek.                Lee Roy landed a huge black bass and proudly showed it to his son.                Back at the dock, it took Cavossa two hours to fillet all the fish. The Roys headed back up to Vermont with enough fish to feed an army.                The next day, Travis Roy sent Carl Cavossa a note.                "I grew up in Maine," he wrote, "in a town close to the ocean. We didn't have a boat, but on occasions when I would get on a friend's boat and out on the ocean, it was always awesome. I obviously can't feel, can't move, can't do much of anything. But I can take in a moment or an experience in life like not many people can.            "Sitting in the back of the boat watching the rooster tail and the spray of the ocean is magical,'' Roy wrote. "It reminds me of sitting next to a campfire. I can watch the flames and embers of a fire for hours. Seeing the colors and clarity of the ocean as the wake forms and then dissipates is exhilarating.''                "Having my glasses covered with ocean spray was unexpected, one of those little things that you forget about when you haven't been on the ocean for 20 years. Just licking the salt off my lips was a treat, a sensation, a taste I had forgotten about."                But that wasn't Travis Roy's favorite part of the fishing trip.                "I'm afraid it's probably not in the cards for me to have a son, but I've got the best dad in the world. The bonding that went on yesterday between father and son was special. I loved seeing each of you interact with your sons. Nature has filled your kids with your DNA, but it is your nurturing that fills their souls. Yesterday was one of those moments that will forever be ingrained in your kids, whether they realize it or not."                Travis Roy told me that the fishing trip was a microcosm of his life since Oct. 20, 1995, when he lost so much on the ice.                His family, his friends, have given him opportunities that so many others never get.                "I have benefited from the kindness of complete strangers for the past 20 years," he said. "No, this isn't the life that I wanted to live. But at the same time, I am very aware of how fortunate I am. We all have our challenges. It's important to sit back and count your blessings, too."                    Kevin Cullen is a Globe columnist. He can be reached at cullen@globe.com. Follow him on Twitter @GlobeCullen.

This was always supposed to be Georgia's bye week.
   
 Then it wasn't under the SEC's schedule 2.0.
   
 Now it is again with the league making adjustments.
   
 Kirby Smart is rolling with whatever this season in a pandemic brings.
   
 It's an open date -- announced last Friday -- before Kentucky instead of prior to the Florida game.
   
 "It doesn't really change anything," Smart said. "It just gives us a week to recover now as opposed to a week to recover before Florida. We've just got to play a really physical, physical Kentucky team first, and then go play Florida. And Kentucky is always one of the most physical teams in the league."
   
 Here are five things the Bulldogs are addressing during this week without a game that comes after a 41-24 loss at Alabama Saturday night.
   
 Time to mend up
   
 Georgia's most significant injuries happened before the season started.
   
 Wide receiver Dominick Blaylock was lost to another ACL injury. Five star cornerback Kelee Ringo is out after shoulder surgery. Freshman wide receiver Arian Smith is sidelined following knee surgery.
   
 Now, the Bulldogs are dealing with more minor maladies.
   
 "We're a beat up football team so we've got a lot of guys that got to get well, but we've got a lot of guys that have to get better," Smart said.
   
 Running back Kenny McIntosh sustained a knee injury early against Alabama.
   
 "I don't know if it was on the opening kick or if it was one of the first carries" Smart said. "I'm not sure exactly when it happened. We don't think he's going to be out long. But he's hurting a little bit."
   
 Smart said McIntosh, who also returns kicks for Georgia, would practice with a non-contact jersey starting this week.
   
 "We'll see how he goes day to day, but we don't think it's anything long term," Smart said.
   
 Cornerback DJ Daniel has been bothered by an ankle injury.
   
 "He's been practicing, done everything that we've asked of him," Smart said. "He's rehabbed, he's trying to get better. We're hopeful that he gets to 100 percent this week and get back to the level that he was playing at last year."
   
 Inside linebacker Monty Rice, who played despite battling a foot injury last week, certainly could use a break in the schedule to get closer to 100 percent.
   
 Wide receiver Matt Landers, who made the trip to Alabama, is dealing with a shoulder injury sustained against Tennessee.
   
 "I thought it was a pass interference, but the play he got banged up on he came back in and helped us in the game on special teams," Smart said. "But he was limited during the week of practice."
   
 Looking deeper down roster
   
 Georgia's SEC-only schedule has meant the Bulldogs haven't been able to get in as many players as they did this year at this time
   
 The Bulldogs saw Murray State and Arkansas State in its first four games last season when 95 different Bulldogs got in games. This time, the number is 72.
   
 ""It makes the off week that much more important," Smart said. "I know we've played fewer, for sure. We've probably had to dress fewer, for sure. You have to travel, you dress fewer. When you play SEC games the rule is different than non-conference. We knew that coming in."
   
 Georgia trailed in the opener against Arkansas into the second half and also had league games with Auburn, Tennessee and Alabama.
   
 "I hate it for the development of the rest of your roster across the rest of the league," Smart said. "That's the most frustrating thing for coaches. You got kids that want to play and that's what they want to do. It's tough to get them in in some of the competitive environments. So where does their growth come? You gotta sell their growth in practice and when they go against the ones on scout team. There's not going to be a lot of opportunities to play a lot of guys."
   
 About stepping up in the pocket and batted balls
   
 Georgia is going back to fundamentals this week in practice as it goes Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.
   
 Expect quarterback Stetson Bennett to work on stepping up in the pocket.
   
 "We do a lot of drills in practice to simulate the pocket where you have to step up and through it," Smart said. "I think that's one of the things Jake (Fromm) was really good at. He could fill the pocket and step up in the pocket in either run or throw. And we continue to work with Stetson on that. He's shown the ability to do that. He didn't always trust it Saturday, and he's got to do a good job of that. He's got good pass protectors around him."
   
 The 5-foot-11 Bennett had five passes batted down with Alabama linemen reaching out to re-direct passes.
   
 "Alabama has really big defensive linemen, which typically push or cave in the pocket," Smart said. "Some of it is looking for a throwing window. Some of it is being willing to pull it down and run because he's a really good athlete and avoid that if he doesn't have that throwing window."
   
 Smart said Bennett's stature isn't only to blame for the batted passes.
   
 "You look across the league in the NFL, college football, height is not the greatest indicator of batted balls," Smart said. "It's the pocket. And a lot of that comes from experience. And he's gaining experience. He's not elite in experience, he doesn't have a ton of it."
   
 Seeking even more from pass rush
   
 It was a promising start pressuring the quarterback Saturday.
   
 Azeez Ojulari glided through and hit Mac Jones as his pass floated out and safety Richard LeCounte snagged the interception.
   
 That was just one three quarterback hurries that the Bulldogs were credited with in a game in which Jones went 24 of 32 for 417 yards and 4 touchdowns.
   
 "They have a good offensive line," Ojulari said. "We were getting there at times. We had good opportunity, good rushes. If you come, he might throw it quick. It's just taking advantage of every opportunity you get to rush the passer."
   
 Georgia did have 3 sacks from Nakobe Dean, Malik Herring and Jermaine Johnson, but Smart felt that the Bulldogs didn't get to Jones enough.
   
 "We didn't get as much pressure as we always do, and that has a lot to do with their offensive line," Smart said. "There's probably been some guys running open like they did (Saturday) in other games but we got there, if you know what I mean. … I didn't think we converted to pass rush really well. We were hunkered down trying to stop the run and when we did pressure, it didn't get home."
   
 Focus is within
   
 Georgia's football Twitter account posted a message on Monday calling this a "work week," something Dean echoed on Tuesday night.
   
 "We will work hard this week to go physical like we always do in off weeks and try to get better," Smart said.
   
 The Bulldogs won't work much on future opponents this week, but instead work on things it can do to improve.
   
 "We're trying to improve our ability to execute at a high level and when we do that on defense and offense, we're pretty good," Smart said. "When we don't, we're not. We've got to develop more depth on the offensive line and we've got to get the guys within the offensive line to play with more conditioning and stamina so that when we do go tempo we can out-compete the other team in terms of conditioning level."

It's easier to understand now why Gov. Charlie Baker didn't want to cancel Halloween. He had his costume all picked out. And no he's not dressing as Donald Trump.            Whether by sleight of hand or happenstance, Baker, the budgetary magician, managed to take a lot of the sting this week out of an exercise in fiscal obligation that legislators had been wringing their hands over for months, spooked by the pain it would inflict.            The longer Washington took to fight over the next stimulus package, the longer Beacon Hill could put off its inevitable need to pass a balanced budget for the year. Even, and maybe most importantly, if that meant waiting until after the election.            That can-kicking stopped Wednesday, Oct. 14.            Baker waved his wand and updated the state's revenue forecast to reflect a $3.6 billion drop in tax collections compared to what had been projected back in January. It was better than the $5 billion to $8 billion once feared, but it wasn't couch change either. Then for his next act, Baker submitted a revised state budget to the Legislature that actually increased proposed spending by about $900 million from his January plan, tipping the scales at $45.5 billion for the year.            "Pretty neat trick, huh?" Baker said, smiling wryly at a question about how he accomplished that feat.            But it didn't take David Copperfield to unravel how he did it. A combination of federal relief money and tapping the state's "rainy day" savings fund to the tune of $1.35 billion got the budget almost all the way back to black. Add in another $515 million in savings squeezed out of agency budgets by asking them to forgo increases from fiscal year 2020 and voila.            The governor's budget did not raise any new broad-based taxes and incorporated the final, mandated drop in the income tax to 5 percent in January, but he also delayed a charitable giving tax deduction and reproposed a accelerated method for collecting sales taxes that would net the state $267 million in one-time revenue, but has been rejected as unworkable by the Legislature more than once.            The MBTA also continues to contemplate major service reductions as MassHealth, the state's Medicaid program, consumes much of the proposed spending growth in the budget, and schools are being told to wait on the full funding promised in last year's Student Opportunity Act.            Needless to say, Baker's updated budget recommendation was just the start of the process, and one the governor optimistically said he'd like to see wrapped up by Thanksgiving.            While that may take another act of magic to accomplish, Senate Ways and Means Chairman Michael Rodrigues called it a "responsible" plan that gives the Legislature a "good foundation" to build their own budgets - even if that foundation is built on one-time money.            A virtual hearing on the governor's revised budget has been planned, and the timeline after that remains anyone's guess. The budget revision came on the heels of Baker throwing more money at another problem: housing stability.            Prepared to let the moratorium on evictions and foreclosures expire, the administration released a plan Monday that it developed with Trial Court Chief Justice Paula Carey to try to stem the rising tide of eviction proceedings by increasing rental assistance by $100 million and bolstering landlord-tenant mediation and other supports.            Without knowing exactly how many residents are at risk of losing their homes, Baker said it was too risky to let tenants continue to accumulate debt if they can't afford to pay their rents. Many advocates applauded the direction the proposal took, but some said the governor's $171 million plan won't address the true needs.            Demonstrators and political leaders, from state Rep. Kevin Honan to U.S. Rep. Ayanna Pressley and Attorney General Maura Healey, continued to pressure Baker all week to extend the moratorium, at least until he could get his own program up and running. But they did so in the face of overwhelming evidence that the governor had no intention of taking that step.            Rep. Mike Connolly of Cambridge even tried Thursday, Oct. 15, to force passage of an emergency petition to extend the moratorium until January, but the furthest he got was getting the bill admitted to the House.            Connolly said at the very least his petition would give Baker more time to get the tenant and landlord support services that are part of his own plan up and running.            And at most, it would give legislators like him and Honan more time to convince leadership on Beacon Hill to pass a popular housing stability bill that would not only extend the moratorium until a year after the health emergency is lifted, but also freeze rents during that time.            As it stands, the moratorium was lifted over the weekend. But that doesn't preclude legislative action in the days or weeks to come.            "When you think about the concerns of our constituents, the challenges facing the commonwealth, I would like us to actually utilize the abilities we have to make policy and pass legislation," Connolly said, expressing his frustration that neither the House nor the Senate has met in a formal session since July 31, despite voting to extend formal sessions beyond that date in part to deal with pandemic-related issues.            Now the middle of October, Massachusetts has seen its average daily COVID-19 case rate over the past two weeks climb to 8.7 cases per 100,000, which would put it in the state's own highest risk "red" category if it were a city or town.            But Massachusetts is not a town. And Baker made clear that he's not putting much stock in where Massachusetts stands collectively on the virus transmission scale, just where communities stand. Because, he said, there continue to be many, many municipalities where COVID-19 is contained.            Still, 27 more cities and towns moved into the highest risk category this week, bringing the total to 64 of the 351 municipalities, including many of the the state's largest cities.            "There's no question that there will be more cases this fall," Baker said.            Good thing Massachusetts is prepared, according to the governor.            Sandwiched between his housing announcement on Monday and his budget rollout on Wednesday, Baker staged a press conference with the lieutenant governor and multiple cabinet secretaries to tick through everything the state has done since March to respond to the pandemic, and how that experience has prepared the government to deal with a fall surge, if it arrives.            Adequate supplies of personal protective equipment are on hand, hospitals stand ready to quickly build out ICU capacity and the state's testing and tracing program is no worse than second to one, the governor assured.            "We've done the work. We're prepared to respond to this virus like never before," Baker said. "But our preparations are of little use without the people of Massachusetts continuing to do their part."            In Massachusetts, that part involves wearing a mask, which President Trump continued to equivocate on the value of this week after recovering himself from COVID-19. Trump's attitude toward COVID-19 and Baker's opinion of the federal government's response to the pandemic are undoubtedly part of the reason Baker won't be voting for Trump, which the governor confirmed this week to the surprise of no one.            Baker, however, did not endorse Joe Biden and suggested he might not vote at all.             He could always follow the lead of his good friend and fellow anti-Trump Republican Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland, who, according to the Washington Post, wrote in Ronald Reagan on his ballot when he voted early.
