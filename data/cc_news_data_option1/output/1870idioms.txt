WASHINGTON -- U.S. Supreme Court justices on Wednesday grilled a lawyer advocating that "electors" in the complex Electoral College system that decides the winner of U.S. presidential elections are free to disregard laws directing them to back the candidate who prevails in their state's popular vote.
 If enough electors do so, it could upend an election - or, as some of the justices said, cause "chaos."
 The justices were hearing arguments two closely watched cases - one from Colorado and one from Washington state - less than six months before the Nov. 3 election in which presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden challenges Republican President Donald Trump.
 The litigation involves the presidential election system set out in the U.S. Constitution in which the winner is determined not by amassing a majority in the national popular vote but by securing a majority of electoral votes allotted to the 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia.
 The cases involve so-called faithless electors who did not vote for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Electoral College even though she won the popular vote in their states.
 Colorado and Washington state are among the 48 states - only Maine and Nebraska excepted - with winner-takes-all systems awarding all electors to the candidate who wins the state's popular vote.
 Conservative Justice Samuel Alito raised the possibility of chaos if there were a close election because "the rational response of the losing political party … would be to launch a massive campaign to try to influence electors."
 Lawyer Lawrence Lessig, representing the Washington state electors, conceded that was a possibility.
 Conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh asked whether the court should embrace the "avoid-chaos principle of judging, which suggests that if it's a close call or a tie-breaker we shouldn't facilitate or create chaos."
 In the early stages of the arguments, justices probed the discrepancy between electors taking an oath to pledge their vote to the winner of the popular vote in their states and the arguments made by their lawyers that they cannot be punished for refusing to uphold their promise.
 "It's somewhat hard to understand the concept of something I am pledged - bound - to do. I have made a promise to do something. But that promise is unenforceable," liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said.
 Conservative Chief Justice John Roberts asked Lessig whether, as long as there is no penalty, then "simply requiring a prospective elector to take a pledge is okay in your view?"
 Lessig said that it would be acceptable, noting that the states can impose a moral obligation but not a legally enforceable one.
 The Electoral College vote, held weeks after the general election, is often overlooked as a mere formality in which the electors - typically party loyalists - actually vote for the winner of their state's popular vote.
 But in 2016, 10 of the 538 electors voted for someone else. While that number of so-called faithless electors did not change the election's outcome, it would have in five of the 58 previous U.S. presidential elections.
 INTEGRITY OF DEMOCRACY
 State officials have said faithless electors threaten the integrity of American democracy by subverting the will of the electorate and opening the door to corruption. The plaintiffs said the Constitution requires them to exercise independent judgment to prevent unfit candidates from taking office.
 The justices must decide if states can penalize faithless electors with actions such as monetary fines or removal from the role. Thirty-two states and the District of Columbia have laws intended to control how electors vote. Only a handful enforce them with penalties.
 "If the Supreme Court agrees with us and in my opinion the founding fathers, they'll find that electors are completely able to use their judgment to determine who they should vote for," said Bret Chiafalo of Everett, Washington, one of the lead plaintiffs.
 Trump's administration has taken no stance in the cases.
 Chiafalo and another lead plaintiff Micheal Baca were Democratic electors who sought to persuade Republican electors to disregard their pledges and help deny Trump the presidency. Baca, who now lives in Las Vegas, was a Colorado elector. They cast their ballots for moderate Republicans and not Clinton.
 Chiafalo was fined $1,000 by Washington state. Baca's vote was canceled by Colorado officials. The electors argued that the penalties against them by their states violated the Constitution's Article II and its 12th Amendment, which delineate the Electoral College process.
 A lower court upheld Washington state's fine against Chiafalo and two other faithless electors. Another court concluded that Colorado's action against Baca violated his constitutional rights.

BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union unveiled Wednesday its plan to help citizens across the 27 nations salvage their summer vacations after months of tough coronavirus confinement and to hopefully resurrect Europe’s badly battered tourism industry.
 Around 150,000 people have died across Europe and Britain since the virus surfaced in northern Italy in February, but with the spread of the disease tapering off, people in many countries are cautiously venturing out of confinement to return to work and some schools are reopening.
 A question on the minds of people, tour operators and the thousands of small businesses that depend on the tourism industry is whether this year's warmest months will turn into a lost summer, with most Europeans reduced to a home- style “staycation.”
 “This is not going to be a normal summer, not for any of us. But when we all work together, and we all do our part … then we don’t have to face a summer stuck at home or a complete lost summer for the European tourist industry,” Commission Executive Vice-President Margrethe Vestager told reporters.
 In a series of guidelines, the EU’s executive arm, the European Commission, laid out its advice for lifting ID checks on hastily closed borders, helping to get airlines, ferries and buses running while ensuring the safety of passengers and crew, and preparing health measures for hotels to reassure clients.
 But a big question remains: will the countries of the world’s biggest trading bloc follow the advice? Faced with a disease about which much is still unknown, national capitals have tended to go it alone, and they - not the EU Commission - have the final say over health and security matters.

“We are in health care and in the emergency department for a reason and that reason has never been more clear,” Steele continued. “This is a challenge that our team grabbed and owned to make a difference.”
 Both Steele and Short expressed concerns about bringing the coronavirus to their homes and the potential threat to family members.
 “It is a process,” Steele said. “I do not wear scrubs to and from the hospital. Worn scrubs go in a bag and then directly into the clothes washer. The bag is safely discarded. I have a pair of work shoes I leave at the hospital. Once home, I take off my clothes in the garage and they go in the washer. I shower when I get home after every shift.”
 Steele has 13-year-old twins at home and they talk about what is going on in the world sticking to facts and avoiding hysteria.
 Short said he wears street clothes or spare scrubs to work, works in scrubs, then showers and changes clothes before returning home. He keeps work shoes in the garage, and work scrubs go straight into the wash with hot water.
 Both emergency room physicians said the easing of restrictions to combat the virus will be a slow process.
 “Social distancing and the provisions in place have had the desired effect — they have flattened the curve here in Madison County, and we have not had an overwhelming surge of sick patients,” Short said. “COVID is not gone. The return to normal is going to be a slow process, not a flip of a switch and return to normal.”
 Steele said the easing of restrictions will be a very difficult decision to make.
 “I trust that the governor has excellent counsel to assist in his decision,” he said. “We know that we need to get the low-risk population back to work while protecting the vulnerable. “
 Short said there has been a decrease in patients seeking emergency care for the past eight weeks, a trend taking place across the United States.
 “There is concern that people are not being seen for true emergencies due to concerns about COVID,” he said. “I can certainly provide anecdotes about people who stayed home too long with real emergencies due to fear of coming to the emergency department. I would encourage people to not delay care due to concerns about COVID.”

Commercial roll out of the ambitious 5G technology in India has been in a hang for years now with the delay seemingly stretching over and beyond 2020 as well. While the industry has been in conflict with the government over what it contends as high pricing and scanty availability of the spectrum in the 3.3-3.6 GHz bands, the financial knockout on account of AGR has effectively made the operators incapable of bidding within this fiscal.
 Even though Airtel, Vodafone Idea, Jio and BSNL submitted applications to conduct field trials with DoT on January 15, industry experts still see 5G coming to India by 2022 since telcos having their balance sheets badly bruised lack monetary headroom to bid for the final auctions.
 In contrast, just two days before the new year, on December 30, the government allowed Chinese player Huawei (read all vendors) to conduct field trials in partnership with the telecom players. The move came after India’s prolonged silence over Huawei’s participation in 5G deployments in light of the United States pressing India to bar Huawei from deploying the network. India, however, finally took a position on the issue as it juggles to maintain strategic balance with two of its major trade partners--China and the US.

Lastly is New Japan Pro Wrestling's 'corporate social responsibility.' New Japan is an industry leader both in Japan and worldwide, with that position comes a great responsibility. As a global society holds a magnifying glass up to us, it behooves New Japan to act to the highest possible ethical standards. We are currently living under a national state of emergency declared by the Japanese government, and have been strongly advised to exercise the maximum of self-restraint when it comes to our activities and individuals and as a business. To hold even empty arena matches in these circumstances would reflect badly on ourselves and our industry, and we will not trade our reputation as a positive force for social good even in the wake of harsh economic realities. It is the good will that we have fostered with our audience, our partners, and society that led to Wrestle Kingdom 14 this year becoming a tremendous success, allowing us to continue operating in the black. That goodwill must be protected at all costs._"

I am a confessed \"involved\" parent and I believe strongly that young people benefit from the example their parents set for them. Yet I am also keenly aware that every parenting generation is somewhat out of touch and it makes perfect sense that the learning in a family needs to be a two-way street. If we seek to have the term expert attached to us, perhaps it would be better to say we are expert learners than expert teachers because the reality is, we cannot teach with true expertise what we cannot understand from our limited experiences. I have learned, over the years, that the best parenting strategy to cope with generational differences is to ask lots of questions, rather than try to provide absolute answers or directions.

But I’m less likely to spread it than the people who work in the supermarkets, who in turn are less likely to spread it than the people who work in hospitals. For any given volume of tests, the priority should be on ensuring detection of cases among people who, if they are positive, are very likely to spread the infection to large numbers of other people. That will get us the most “bang for the buck” in terms of reducing infections. Then, as test capacity grows, more people can be tested.

When she does open, Kruger asks people not to arrive too early for appointments unless they are from the same household.
 “Give me enough time to wipe down,” she said.
 Pierrot Hair Design owner Bruce Rillema will open his salon the day after the governor allows it. He installed plexi glass at the welcome desk, clear shower curtains around the sinks and will only have customers in two chairs at a time.
 “We have three chairs and we will leave the middle one open so there will be 12 feet of distance,” he said. “I have one part-time employee who is only in a couple hours a month and she agreed to use the other person’s chair or work after hours.”
 Once the rules changed to allow self-employed people to apply for unemployment, Rillema and his employees were able to receive it.
 He expects when they do reopen there will be a rush of customers.
 “I am getting phone calls constantly,” he said. “We are scheduled past June 1. Now I’m asking people to call when we are allowed to open. We will have to work six days a week just to catch up.”
 The company Director’s Cut uses for booking appointments sent a list of guidelines recommended for salons and barber shops that Bailey plans to follow.
 “There will be one person at the chair per stylist. No friends will be allowed to come along unless they are also having their hair done. Hairdressers will wear masks. There will be sanitizing between customers. The employees at their stations will have to social distance. The waiting rooms will change so people can’t sit down and hang out,” he explained.
 He is unsure if the customers will be required to wear masks, but whatever the government guidelines are, he will follow them “to a T.”
 “When we were first shut down, a couple salons in the lower part of the state continued to work and were fined. The licensing bureau can take away their license. They have the authority to do that,” he said.
 Bailey said he will not do house calls.
 “We are not allowed to do in-home haircuts. That would be breaking the social distancing,” he said. “Some might be doing it, but I think it’s unsafe.”

Continuano gli interventi della federazione italiana pallacanestro a favore dell'intero movimento del basket nazionale e anche lariano. Dopo che l'ultimo consiglio federale per far fronte all'emergenza coronavirus ha deciso di stanziare un piano pari quasi a 7 milioni di euro a sostegno della ripresa dell'attività di società e addetti ai lavori ma anche di posticipare al 31 luglio 2020 il termine di riaffiliazione a tutti i campionati professionistici e non, ecco che in queste ore è arrivato un altro intervento concreto questa volta a favore degli allenatori italiani di ogni categoria e livello. Il CNA, il Comitato Nazionale Allenatori di basket ha inviato a tutti i comitati regionali una lettera per comunicare la sospensione ufficiale del programma dei punti di aggiornamento PAO per i tesserati CNA di tutti i livelli. Una lettera che il comitato regionale Lombardia ha poi inoltrato anche a tutti i tecnici della provincia di Como che in queste ore stanno ricevendo il comunicato. Ricordiamo che i punti Pao sono un aggiornamento obbligatorio per ogni allenatore indispensabile per il suo tesseramento a ogni stagione agonistica. Questa sospensione relativa alla stagione 2019/20 non pregiudicherà però il tesseremento degli allenatori alla stagione sportiva 2020/21.

However, they anticipated an uptick in helpline calls as things unfolded; and indeed, correspondence in early May has been steadily on the rise.
 “The pandemic is having — and will continue to have — a huge and lasting impact on our mental health and access to services,” Mahoney said.
 Mahoney acknowledges that, currently, most of us experience some level of anxiety, plus feelings of lack of control and safety. Folks who already manage such emotions regularly know that routine and structure can be useful tools; unfortunately, the current situation often makes those seem impossible.
 Mahoney advised, “Recognizing how you’re feeling and doing what you can to create pockets of structure, comfort and connection can help you take care of yourself and cope with difficult situations. Even when you don’t have full control of a situation — which none of us do right now! — there are things you can do.”
 So what are some first steps? Mahoney points to some frequently cited ideas, from maintaining a routine and getting enough sleep to eating healthful foods and prioritizing physical activity. Yet she offers other suggestions, too.
 “First off, remember that social distancing does not mean social isolation," Mahoney said. "You don't need to fill your schedule with Zoom happy hours and group chats; regular phone calls to a close friend or two will do.”
 When it comes to the health benefits of social connectedness, it’s the quality — not quantity — of interactions that matter. This could also mean attending an online support group (namiseattle.org/covid-19) or connecting with strangers (leave a kind note for a neighbor, or volunteer remotely for a community organization).
 NAMI also recommends limiting your news consumption. Repeatedly digesting information about a situation beyond one’s control can increase feelings of anxiety and powerlessness. “Try giving yourself a couple of 15-minute blocks each day for news updates from trusted sources,” said Mahoney, “and let the rest go.” Another suggestion from NAMI: find yourself some "resilience role models" — people in current or past situations of adversity, whose actions help keep the pandemic in perspective.

A general rule of thumb is to have at least one litter box per cat, and at least one litter box on each floor, for easy access. Although there are different types of litters, ranging from traditional clay litter to self- clumping litter to biodegradable litters, cats are fussy and don’t react well to changes. It’s best to stick with whatever type they are used to, and to avoid filling the box too full. A couple inches is enough.

As far as the west is concerned, the deal was just kicking the can down the road in the hope that by the time it expires, there would be a major change in the Iranian establishment, instrumental by a potential death of its leader. This is because they understand, there is no _stopping_ the Iranian program, but only buying time.

The planned demolition of a commercial building near Arlington Center will lead to a number of businesses searching for new homes.      "We were told a few months ago that we were going to have to be out of here by the end of May," said Banbitt Thanapermsuk, owner of Thana Thai, located at 882A Massachusetts Avenue.      Last month, Toraya Japanese Restaurant, located at 890 Massachusetts Ave., announced on its website that it would be closing after being notified that its lease was being terminated.      "Established in 1999, Toraya has been open for just over 20 years. Unfortunately, our restaurant is now closed for business. We would like our customers, vendors, and employees to know that we greatly appreciate all of you. Thank you for your generous support throughout the years," a post on the website states.      Thanapermsuk said that the plan for his restaurant moving forward is to operate a takeout business out of the CommonWealth Kitchen in Cambridge, although he won't be able to offer dine-in service. According to their post online, Toraya is currently looking for a place to re-open.      "It is very sad, we have been here for five years and Toraya has been here for 20," Thanapermsuk said.      Arlington Community Media Inc., the local access station in Arlington, is another tenant, as it is home to its B studio. Executive Director Norm McLeod said that the organization has made a substantial investment in the property to turn it into a television studio.      "When we first moved into the location around 2012, it had a lot of work that needed to be done and we spent a lot of money soundproofing it and turning it into a TV studio, probably around $70,000. We can't just go somewhere else," McLeod said.      McLeod said that two years ago, ACMi renewed its lease for two years at the location, which is set to expire at the end of July. McLeod said that they were requested to leave the property by the end of May, but they are still trying to work with the property owner to extend their stay.      "Everything is up in the air right now, we are trying to negotiate to stay in here a little longer, and hopefully by August or September, we will have a new place to go," McLeod said.
 Apartment building proposed
 According to a special permit application submitted to the Arlington Redevelopment Board, the owner of the property is planning on converting the building into a mixed-use development building, containing 22 apartments and 700 square feet of retail space. According to the application, three of the apartments would be identified as affordable housing units.
 The application also describes the building as being four stories tall, and containing 25 parking spaces, which will be placed in a lot behind the property. In total, the building will be 4,693 square feet and be made up primarily of single-bedroom units.
 The property is operated by an entity titled 882-892 Massachusetts Avenue, LLC. Cynthia Pasciuto, a representative for 882-892 Massachusetts Avenue LLC, said that the company is looking to change the property into a more viable entity. Currently, two of the five commercial spaces on the property are vacant.      "Retail is very hard right now, we have had a lot of vacancies over the years.We have been told that the old building isn't attractive," Pasciuto said. "We have seen other projects in town (that are similar) and we think this is a good opportunity to make something more attractive."      Pasciuto said that they have been speaking with their tenants since last fall about the potential project, and that while they have asked all tenants to leave the property by the end of May, she said that they are trying to work with the tenants.      "We have asked them to be out by the end of May, but we also are trying to be flexible with the tenants, especially right now during the pandemic," Pasciuto said.      The Arlington Redevelopment Board will be holding the first public hearing about the proposed project on Monday, May 18. Arlington Planning and Community Director Jenny Raitt said that the Redevelopment Board plans on posting a staff review and assessment of the application by Thursday, May 14.

Lauren Carrick and fiancé Joe Harrison haven't had a good night's sleep in weeks. The two dancers on Celebrity Cruises' Infinity say being held aboard ship for almost two months has left them emotionally drained.
 "I cried all day," said Carrick, 29. "We need to have alcohol to sleep — that's how bad it is. We're worried, tense, stressed out. We just want to get home."
 Carrick and Harrison are among the more than 90,000 cruise workers in U.S. waters stranded on ships two months after the coronavirus pandemic began forcing cruise lines to halt operations and repatriate crew. While companies work through a thicket of shifting rules on returning workers to their home countries, recent deaths of crew have shaken the industry and underscored concern about mental health.
 "It's a very stressful situation," said Fabrizio Barcellona, assistant secretary for seafarers at the International Transport Workers' Federation, which represents local unions. "The prolonged periods they have to stay on board can create a situation of unrest. People can become distressed and that can create flash points."
 Carnival's Princess Cruises said Sunday a 39-year-old crew member from the Ukraine was killed after leaping off its Regal Princess in the port of Rotterdam. The ship's crew was in the process of being repatriated, the company said in an emailed statement.
 Another worker was found dead in his cabin on the Carnival Breeze, unrelated to COVID-19, the company said. Carnival, the world's largest operator, said it was not providing details of the death out of respect for the worker's family.

About 7,100 Filipino crew on 20 ships were anchored in Manila bay as of last week, awaiting government testing and clearance to return home, the Philippine Coast Guard said. Many have been confined to their cabins for at least two weeks, according to crew and some operators. They will be quarantined 14 more days before leaving the vessel, the Coast Guard said in an email.
 Royal Caribbean has said all 25,000 crew members on its ships have completed 14 days of in-room quarantine and are now practicing social distancing. While the company has repatriated about 9,100 seafarers, plans are still being made for the others, who come from 60 different countries, Bayley said in the letter.
 Carnival has also cited port closures and travel restrictions as roadblocks to getting crew back on land. The operator repatriated 20,000 workers last month, leaving 52,500 waiting to go home as of Friday, according to Roger Frizzell, a spokesman for Carnival, which employs about 90,000 crew on 105 cruise ships.
 The business shutdown for many cruise operators began in earnest March 14, when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued its first-ever no sail order for all cruise ships in U.S. waters.
 The order banned passengers from boarding and required lines to come up with plans to contain COVID-19 infections. Since February, more than 30 cruise voyages have been linked to coronavirus outbreaks, according to the CDC website.
 Last month, the CDC updated requirements that called for cruise company executives to guarantee that seafarers would be flown home on charter flights and other private transport. Under the rules, crew should not use public airport terminals or transportation to avoid the risk of spreading infections.

Others “rejiggered” their manufacturing capabilities to enable the country to address the shortages of facemasks, sanitizers, respirators and other supplies. Since we’re far from out of the woods as far as coronavirus goes, it appears many of those companies will continue to churn out those medical essentials until sufficient supplies are on hand to meet this, and future, health concerns.
 One of the first to step up was PRADCO a fishing products manufacturer headquartered in Ft. Smith, AK. This is normally one of the busiest times of the year for company’s segment of the outdoor industry when production of lures and fish attractants would be in high gear. Most parts of the U.S. are open for fishing and many places are reporting increased fishing activities since a large portion of the population are sheltering and out of work. At the marinas I’ve been visiting, Wednesday is the new Saturday, it seems.
 PRADCO retooled their plastic lure molding capability to pumping out face shields out of the same materials originally destined to become a Rebel Minnow or Heddon Spook. They also make lures infused with YUM bait attractant as well as YUM liquid/gel which can be applied to any lure. That production line switched to producing YUM hand sanitizer.
 In Springfield, Massachusetts, Smith & Wesson firearms company joined the effort by donating 10,000 pairs of protective eyewear to Baystate Health. That was followed by 300 face shields for the Police and Fire Departments and the Health Department’s homeless medical operation.

While some staffs have shown they can draw players from all over the country even during a pandemic, Simmons believes more prospects eventually will decide to stay closer to home.


  Part of the reason is the NCAA instituted a recruiting dead period through May 31, preventing programs from getting an up-close look at out-of-state prospects. No wonder 13 of North Carolina’s 14 verbal commitments are from in- state.


  “A lot of kids, they can drive to your campus, come for games, come for camps, so we’ve gotten to really know these kids,” Brown said. “So if it’s a no-brainer and we really want him, we’re already a year-and-a-half ahead of schools that are out of state that haven’t seen the kids.”


  Simmons predicts there won’t be as many examples of guys going all the way across the country. For example, four of the 247Sports Composite’s top nine 2020 prospects from California signed with Alabama, Georgia or Clemson. Maybe more of those players stay in Pac-12 country this time.


  “I think across the board, I would expect a little bit more of a trend of kids staying, not necessarily home, but closer to home,” Simmons said.

While there’s certainly no reason a mom-to-be can’t throw her own virtual shower, it’s best to delegate the task out to a trusted friend or family member. This way, she can kick back and relax without having to worry about planning or playing the role of host.

The company posted a value of $1.30 as earning-per-share over the last full year, while a chance, will post $2.77 for the coming year. The current EPS Growth rate for the company during the year is -20.40% and predicted to reach at 0.11% for the coming year. In-depth, if we analyze for the long-term EPS Growth, the out- come was -8.70% for the past five years and the scenario is totally different as the current prediction is 2.75% for the next five year.

Hadn’t I just heard that some of his key people, including Vice President Mike Pence, had been exposed to the virus and had to self-quarantine? How did this infection get into the White House — one of the most secure locations in the world — anyway?
 One of the COVID-19 conundrums is testing. First of all, I don’t believe any country has a reliable test for it. Second, even if a reliable test were available, it would probably take months to administer it to millions of Americans, process the results, and inform those who tested either positive or negative.
 But it doesn’t stop there. Word is that those who test positive (possibly millions) would have to be traced. That means recruiting and hiring tens of thousands of workers, training them, and sending them out to find the positives.
 Their main job would be to locate those who tested positive and find out with whom they had contact within a few days prior to their test, track those people down, make sure they got tested again, and get a list of people with whom they, too, had recent, close contact. If it doesn’t work that way, the process doesn’t work at all.
 If I am correct, right now less than 2% of all Americans have been tested. What that means is that the number of those who test positive is likely to explode exponentially. That would mean plenty of work for the trackers, and it would probably take years to accomplish.
 In the meantime, medical researchers have yet to find either a treatment or a vaccine to stop the coronavirus and its ruinous impact on our society — our large and small businesses, restaurants, airlines, hotels, churches, schools, and all aspects of family and community life.
 It’s a difficult and confusing question for the experts. What shall we do? We can’t throw in the towel. There is no way out of this but to fight. Winston Churchill is believed to have said, “If you’re going through hell, keep going.” I think that just about sums up where we are right now.

 Büyükşehir Konferans Salonu'nda yapılan, Yeni tip korona virüs (COVID-19) Salgını tedbirlerinin hat safhada olduğu bileşimde görev süresi dolan encümen ve komisyonların üyelerinin seçimi yapıldı.
   
 Büyükşehir Belediyesi meclisi korona virüs Salgını tedbirleri kapsamında uzun bir aradan sonra Mayıs Ayı birinci bileşimi Büyükşehir Belediye Başkanı Fatma Şahin'in başkanlığında toplandı. Virüse karşı yoğun tedbirlerin alındığı, genişliğinden dolayı Büyükşehir Konferans Salonu'nda yapılan bileşimde, ateş ölçümleri yapıldı, maske zorunluluğu getirildi, kişiler arası 3 koltuk mesafe bırakılarak oturuldu.
   
 Toplantı öncesi korona virüs mücadelesi hakkında bilgi veren ve diğer ülkelerle ülkemizde yapılan icraatleri karşılaştıran başkan Şahin, “Küresel bir sorunla ulusal bir mücadele veriyoruz. Geçen hafta Türkiye Belediyeler Birliği Başkanı olarak hem iskandinav, hem Avrupa birliğinden belediye başkanlarıyla telekonferans aracılığıyla bir araya geldim. Dünya'nın yaşadığı bu büyük sorunu ulusal boyutta nasıl görüyorlar, daha neler yapılabilir bunun çalışmasını yaptık. Brezilya özellikle kendisi talep ederek Türkiye'nin bu başarısındaki farkını incelediği ve bunu bizimle paylaştıklarını söylediler. Özellikle Dünya'da bu büyük mücadeleyi verirken Türkiye'nin bu 4 ana başlıkta farklılığının ortaya çıktığını söylediler. Birincisi sağlık sistemleri için kurumsal kapasite. Türkiye'nin son dönemde yaptığı sağlıktaki yoğun bakım ünitelerindeki farklılık bu büyük sorunda büyük bir çözüm kapasitesi oluştuğunu belirtiyorlar. 100 bin kişiye normalde ne kadar yatak kapasitesi düşüyor diye bir literatür var. Türkiye'nin 45 yoğun bakım kapasitesi varken Japonya'nın 6, İngiltere'nin 7 olduğunu söylüyorlar. İkincisi sosyal güvenlik sistemi. Özellikle sağlığa ulaşımda ulaşılabilirlik, ücretsiz hizmet alma konusunda herkese istisnasız sistemden hızlı istifade edebiliyor. Üçüncüsü güçlü liderlik. Brezilya'nın söylediği bir diğer etken güçlü koordinasyon. Valiliğimizn öncülüğünde bütün belediye başkanları ve kurumlarla güçlü bir koordinasyon oluşturduk. Yerel ve merkez iyi çalıştı ve gelen genelgelerin uygulaması için güçlü bir gayret gösterildi. Şu ana kadar bilim kurulundan çıkan raporlar ve bakanların gelen bildirimleriyle hızlı ve güçlü bir sistem oluşturduk. Artık normalleşmenin gerçekleşmeye başlandığı günlerde meclis toplantımızı bile yaparken maske ve sosyal mesafenin çok önemli olduğunu ve artık yeni bir çalışma metodunun hayata geçeceği belirtiliyor. Başkan vekillerimiz arasında görev dağılımları oldu ve çalışmalar hızlandı. Bir taraftanda her krizin bir fırsatı var şehri büyük bir şantiyeye dönüştürdük. Sizlerde görüyorsunuz” şeklinde konuştu.

Back in 2005, Mark Flibotte was a freshman at Cohasset High School. Lacrosse was gaining in popularity throughout the United States and the Skippers found themselves in the Division 3 state final against Medfield.
 Cohasset lost that game, but there's a happy ending to the story.
 Fast forward 15 years later, and Flibotte and some of his opponents from that day are now on the same team, making a big difference by manufacturing much- needed personal protective equipment during the coronavirus pandemic.
 Flibotte went on to play lacrosse at Bowdoin College in Maine, where he reunited with some of his Medfield foes from 2005, including Jake McCampbell. The college lacrosse buddies and a few others from Bowdoin wound up creating StringKing, a California-based lacrosse equipment company.
 McCampbell is the company president and co-owner, with his cousin, Luke Aronson, who's also from Medfield and played at Yale.
 "It's got a strong sort of Massachusetts lacrosse roots," said Flibotte, StringKing's head of marketing.
 "We started the business because we were all really into lacrosse," noted Flibotte, who led Cohasset to back-to-back state crowns as a sophomore and junior. "We played in college and knew a lot about the products in the market ourselves. So when we started the business, we had some insight into some of the areas that the bigger companies were missing out on."
 The company began by selling the mesh pockets for lacrosse sticks and eventually expanded into hockey, baseball and softball gear. Now the reality of 2020 has forced them to pivot to something entirely new.
 When sporting events started to be canceled due to the coronavirus, StringKing lost about 95 percent of its business in a week. The company is now using its supply chain to sell PPE, including three-layer disposable face masks, reusable cloth face masks and gowns. StringKing has shipped orders to more than 5,000 customers, including hospitals, first responders, nursing homes, food processing plants and government agencies.
 "We looked into cutting a lot of our expenses, just looking at what are we going to do for the next four or six months, how can we keep people employed?" said McCampbell. "How can we be useful in this situation?"
 Flibotte created an Instagram post saying they were looking to supply some masks to those who needed them.
 "Within three hours I had received 800 emails from hospitals and nursing homes and first responders and hospice workers," said McCampbell. "People were requesting a total of just over 300 million masks. So it was pretty clear that there was a pretty serious shortage."
 StringKing went to work and now can output around 70,000 cloth face masks a day. They are also producing around 300,000 three-layer masks. After seeing the need, the company spent days learning about and vetting masks.
 "We set up a lab at our facility (in China) where we are doing filtration testing," said McCampbell. "One of the things that we noticed was around 80 percent of the masks we were testing in China had defective filters."
 Their facility in China is now being used as a quality control system.
 "We were seeing hospitals ordering millions, tens of millions of masks from China without really vetting the product," said McCampbell.
 StringKing then went to local factories making masks to help them vet and test their products. Now the StringKing team does daily filtration testing on the local masks. StringKing is selling the masks online as well as to three different hospital networks in Maryland which they also hope to supply with gowns.
 The company converted its office in Los Angeles into a sewing house for making the cloth masks, going from two employees there to 80. StringKing also now manages 15 other sewing facilities in L.A., employing around 800 people using 50 sewing machines.
 The cloth masks meet the guidelines set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
 "I think that the main thing that we're trying to do is just stay useful," said McCampbell. "Employ as many people as we can and make as many high- quality cloth masks as we can."
 Flibotte left Cohasset as the lacrosse program's all-time leading scorer with 352 career points. As a midfielder at Bowdoin he scored 59 goals, including 29 as a senior. After graduation he worked as a connectivity consultant at Eze Software Group in Boston before jumping on board StringKing with his college teammates.
 Flibotte studied political science and economics at Bowdoin, but no classes could truly prepare him for the twists and turns of his post-playing career.
 "It kind of helps when you have a company if you have to do everything and people have to do things they don't know how to do," said Flibotte. "You've just kind of got to learn on the fly. And I think that's what StringKing has been good at -- just learning how to do things ourselves and always improving."

Despite attempts to restrict contamination, the ship represented, in mid- February 2020, the single largest outbreak outside the virus’ original epicentre in China. However, despite the magnitude of the outbreak and the scale of the attempted response efforts, little information was provided to those onboard during their two-week quarantine. Although passengers remained in their rooms, they were often in contact with visibly sick patients while waiting for testing, and infected crew members, who live in shared rooms, continued to eat and sleep alongside healthy ones. Overall, health experts concluded that the so-called quarantine only worsened the outbreak, and deemed the cruise ship an “incubator” for the virus. Despite this warning, cruises continued to operate after the first outbreak, and it was only after several other outbreaks at sea that cruise lines suspended operations indefinitely. But how did the cruise crisis get this far in the first place, and what could have been done differently on the ships?

While most will say that “beauty is in the eye of the beholder,” there are certain people who, at least in regards to looks, transcend that saying. Still, it’s hardly the full picture, according to clinical sexologist Megan Stubbs, Ed.D. “We run into problems when we jump to conclusions based on someone’s looks — like ‘oh, you’re so hot, you must not be interested in me,’” she says. “We humans are complex creatures. It’s not fair to judge [anyone] on one [thing].” In other words, there’s far more to all of us than what meets the eye.

Councilman Shaun Mahoney, who owns Mahoney’s Restaurant on Main Street, served on the council during the 2008 housing crisis and recession, when water and sewer bills went unpaid and the city had to curtail spending to make ends meet. He said he expects city tax revenue and spending to be down by 60-70 percent.
 “It wasn’t fun,” Mahoney said. “But we survived, and we will survive this too.”
 Edwards said third quarter impacts will likely be felt most acutely in July, based on tax collections from June, which she said will show dramatic shortfalls.
 “This [summer] is usually the time when we spend the most money, but in July we might have to talk about reductions in services,” she said.
 In a memo to the council, Edwards said the projected economic recession will impact property owners’ income and their ability to pay water fees on time, but so far collection rates are unchanged.
 Mayor Ned Burns told Public Works Director Frank Suwanrit to keep a “close eye” on spending.
 “We will prioritize what will keep the city in compliance [with federal and state regulatory requirements] and operational,” Suwanrit said.

In-depth, if we analyze for the long-term EPS Growth, the out-come was 15.30% for the past five years and the scenario is totally different as the current prediction is 6.73% for the next five year.

Organisasi Kesehatan Dunia (WH) memperingatkan bahwa virus corona dapat menyebabkan 190.000 orang dalam 12 bulan mendatang.
 Peringatan ini muncul satu bulan setelah WHO memperkirakan wabah ini dapat menyebabkan 10 juta penularan di benua itu dalam enam bulan.
 Studi baru yang diterbitkan minggu ini oleh WHO memperkirakan antara 29 juta dan 44 juta dapat terinfeksi dalam tahun pertama pandemi Covid-19 bila langkah meredam virus gagal.
 Berbagai analis menekankan dampak pandemi tergantung pada langkah yang diambil berbagai pemerintahan.
 Direktur badan ekonomi PBB untuk Afrika, United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, Stephen Karingi, mengatakan kepada surat kabar Inggris, the Guardian, bahwa "Pemerintah negara-negara Afrika harus diakui melakukan banyak hal untuk menekan wabah."
 "Proyeknya saat ini sudah seperti suasana perang, namun karena langkah-langkah yang diambil pemerintah dan berbagai komunitas masyarakat, angka penularan lebih rendah dibandingkan di wilayah lain," kata Karingi.
 "Mereka memiliki kepadatan penduduk tinggi dengan fasilitas kesehatan yang buruk. Sebagian masyarakat malah tak bisa mendapatkan air bersih," tambahnya.
 The Guardian juga mengangkat fakta bahwa sebagian besar penduduk di Afrika tidak bisa berlama-lama menjalani karantina wilayah karena mereka adalah buruh harian yang harus bekerja tiap hari untuk memberi nafkah keluarga.
 Di tengah berbagai pendapat dan debat terkait mengapa Afrika lebih baik dalam menekan pandemi Covid-19, sebagian besar pakar sepakat bahwa saat ini masih terlalu awal untuk menyebut bahwa "Afrika adalah perkecualian."

Last week, Jasmin San Nicolas waited in line at the Grab-N-Go meals site at Southern High School. When she got home and opened one of the meals, she was disgusted to find food already bitten, with a fork still inside the disposable lunch box.
 She immediately threw the food away, but not after posting the photo on social media, encouraging others to be careful and check their meals beforehand.
 "We're already struggling as it is," San Nicolas said.
 The Grab-N-Go meals provided by the Guam Department of Education help more than 12,000 students with lunch and breakfast every day.
 According to San Nicolas, she has messaged GDOE but has yet to receive a response.
 Isa Baza, spokesperson for GDOE, said the department did not receive the complaint but will be looking into the situation.
 "We encourage anyone with a complaint to immediately inform the school staff or Sodexo so we can verify the complaint and investigate," Baza said. Sodexo is GDOE's cafeteria meals provider.
 Like many, San Nicolas is furloughed and waiting on any financial aid the government can provide.
 The Department of Revenue and Taxation had recently processed 40,000 economic impact relief checks.
 The money would help toward paying utility bills and basic necessities.
 While the Guam Power Authority and Guam Waterworks Authority offer deferment plans for their customers, she would rather make payments on a timely basis rather than it accumulating over time.
 With her husband just recently returning back to work, for now, she said, they are just getting by.
 With Pandemic Condition of Readiness 2, certain businesses and government services are starting to reopen, but San Nicolas believes it's too soon.
 While there are still people recovering from COVID-19, she's fearful there may still be positive cases on island and reopening would help the spread of the virus.

One reason for the rapid transmission of the disease was the inadequate work and sanitation conditions on board the ships, specifically those which disproportionately affect crew members. Mistreatment of workers in the cruise industry has been a long-standing issue, with considerable numbers of reports revealing cramped living quarters and long and intensive working hours. These problems, and the lack of strong regulatory procedures, likely stem from the fact that cruise companies can register their international ships to countries with more relaxed labour and sanitation laws, in order to evade more stringent ones in their country of origin. The international organizations that set cruise ship guidelines, like the United Nations’ International Maritime Organization, have no significant means of holding cruise companies accountable. With limited accountability to international law or their country of origin, most cruise lines have considerable operational leeway.

If we seek to have the term expert attached to us, perhaps it would be better to say we are expert learners than expert teachers because the reality is, we cannot teach with true expertise what we cannot understand from our limited experiences. I have learned, over the years, that the best parenting strategy to cope with generational differences is to ask lots of questions, rather than try to provide absolute answers or directions.

Fine-tuning individual skills and training in small groups could be the new norm for India’s hockey players once the Sports Ministry decides to resume training of athletes across the country, PTI reported.


  Devoid of on-field action for more than one-and-half months due to the coronavirus-forced lockdown, the Indian men and women hockey team players hinted that they would be suggesting Sports Minister Kiren Rijiju to resume training in small groups keeping social distancing norms in mind.


  Rijiju has been conducting a series of online sessions with athletes of various sporting disciplines to get their feedback on resumption of on-field training and will be interacting with the hockey players on Thursday.


  “It is an unprecedented situation which we never expected in our life. We have been stuck in our rooms [at the SAI centre in Bengaluru] since the start of lockdown, but the good thing is that we have all facilities here to keep our bodies in good shape,” a senior member of the men’s hockey team told PTI.


  “We have an online meeting with the Sports Minister tomorrow, where we will suggest him to start training on the ground like working on individuals skills, shooting, 3D skills.


  “We can start practicing individually or say in a group of five with a trainer by following all safety norms like, wearing masks and social distancing etc because the ground in Bengaluru is very big,” he added.


  A member of the women’s team agreed with her male counterpart and said with the Tokyo Olympics postponed by a year, full-throttle training can be avoided for the time being as it will take time for international hockey to resume.


  “Physically, we are maintaining our best shape but we are missing on-field training. We have never been away from the field for such a long time,” the player from the women’s team said.


  “We have been doing exercises at our rooms and have been doing gym sessions in a group of two by maintaining social distancing. We can avoid body contacts by doing away with tackling at present during training,” the player added.


  Both the Indian men and women teams are stuck in SAI South Centre in Bengaluru since the start of the lockdown on March 25. “We have been doing individual exercises at room besides gym sessions in pairs,” the player the women’s team said.


  “Coaches are continuously giving us inputs through online, calls and whenever we meet them personally...so everything is going on fine but we can’t wait to resume training.”


  Training has been suspended across Sports Authority of India centres since mid-March to contain the Covid-19 pandemic.

Mammoth Biosciences, a company developing a toolbox for the next generation of CRISPR-based diagnostics, is partnering with UC San Francisco researchers who are developing a diagnostic test to identify people infected with the new coronavirus. As Leah Rosenbaum of Forbes reports, testing for suspected coronavirus now requires shipping samples to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, where it can take six or more hours to complete the test. The new test from Mammoth Bioscience will work by taking a sample from a nasal swab, putting it into a tube with the CRISPR-Cas system, and then dipping in a color-changing strip of paper to determine whether the test result is positive or negative. The whole thing should take one or two hours and could be done in a doctor’s office.

None of that currently applies in the US. But the key point about contact tracing is that, as with testing, you gain benefits on the margin. We’re a very long way from Romer’s 20 million tests per day, but every additional test performed helps get a handle on the outbreak, especially if the US is able to be intelligent about whom it tests. And every additional contact tracer lets us be more intelligent about how we use our tests. Working in tandem, more testing and more tracing can slow the spread of the disease. And they’d be even more effective if the country did more to isolate people who do test positive.

Harris received the most guaranteed money ($15,000) and largest contract in total value ($140,000) for any Patriots undrafted signing this offseason, according to ESPN's Mike Reiss. As a three-year starter for the Razorbacks, Harris had 100-plus tackles in each of his last three seasons in Fayetteville. Although he's undersized for the position (6-feet, 234 pounds), Harris plays like a throwback linebacker packing a mean punch in the box. He's got a thick frame, tremendous play strength, and isn't afraid to throw his weight around. Harris also plays the run with above-average read and react to blocking schemes and plays through blocks to keep his eyes on the ball carrier. The Arkansas product went undrafted due to his size and limitations in coverage, as he's too stiff to play on third down. But he might be Elandon Roberts 2.0 for the Patriots as an early-down linebacker.

At first, he saw only sick and injured animals but has since opened up the practice to include rabies vaccinations and other vaccines that are time- sensitive for young animals. All other treatments and visits are taken on a case-by-case basis.
 “It depends on the situation,” DeVinne said.
 To limit those who enter Animal Care Clinic, DeVinne established a procedure where clients call from the parking lot for a member of the staff to come outside wearing personal protective equipment to get the animal. What DeVinne found is that many pet owners are now writing down any concerns or questions — since they can’t meet face to face during the visit — which helps to address issues that can often be forgotten during the course of an exam.
 Devinne will then call the owner from the office to discuss what he observed or found. He said part of the fun of being in his line of work is the interactions with people, which he is missing, but has discovered the new protocol cuts down on the amount of time he spends with each appointment.
 “It’s very unusual,” DeVinne said. “A lot gets done by telephone right now and one thing we’ve noticed, it’s very efficient.”
 And Animal Care Clinic is not alone. Great Brook Veterinary Clinic in Antrim has reduced its hours and days of operation to care for only sick and injured animals. They are still dispensing prescription refills, prescription foods, and flea and tick prevention, leaving these for owners on the clinic’s porch.
 As of Monday, Wilton Animal Hospital returned to its regular business hours but will continue to follow its curbside protocol until further notice. Jaffrey-Rindge Veterinary Hospital is asking pet owners to call once they arrive and a member of the hospital’s staff will retrieve a client’s pet. Findings will be discussed over the phone along with payment. Fieldstone Animal Hospital in Rindge has a similar protocol for visits.
 Peterborough Veterinary Clinic is one of the few local clinics still allowing pet owners inside their doors along with their pets. Dr. June Sailor O’Day said that she finds it necessary to communicate directly with pet owners about their pets’ ailments, rather than to have them try to describe the situation and determine treatment options over the phone.
 The reduction in office visits to only necessary appointments has meant “a massive hit to our financial state,” DeVinne said.
 “We started bleeding pretty badly financially,” he said.

A Democratic poll shows Democrat Joe Biden leading Trump there and Bacon and Eastman in a virtual dead heat. President Barack Obama won the district in 2008, but Trump won it in 2016.
 Democrats have enjoyed some success in recent special elections like the one spring 2018 that saw Rep. Conor Lamb famously grab a western Pennsylvania swing seat.
 But analysts say the GOP has a built-in advantage because their supporters tend to vote more reliably. The flip side of that is that Democrats tend to overperform in votes held at the same time as presidential elections.
 Even if Garcia wins in the final count, Democrats are confident Smith will oust him when Trump is on the ballot in November and turnout will be much greater.

We have talked about the CPU cache only so far, but the optimizations don't end there. The CPU has many more mechanisms to process code faster. It can also have a branch predictor and out of order instruction execution support. Both mechanisms work better when going through a contiguous block of memory than, for example, traversing a tree where we need to check if we go right or left. In the tree traversal case, the prediction will fail more often than during the simple check if we need to continue in the linear search or not. There are two branches in the linear search code and both are easily predictable. One checks if we have reached the end of the container and the other one checks if we have found the correct element. Both checks are likely to be false. When the number of elements goes up the more checks we have to do and the time complexity will take its toll. With 60 elements to crunch through, the linear search has to iterate over 30 elements on average and check every one of them and at this point, the constant time complexity of unordered set starts winning.

Why should Joe Biden get due process, but not others accused of sexual misconduct?
 That’s the question raised by the progressive reaction to Tara Reade’s accusation against Biden on the one hand, and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos’ new rules for handling sexual harassment cases on college campuses on the other.
 There have been voices on the left who believe Reade, but generally the note has been one of skepticism about her allegation, along with admonitions that the evidence must be considered carefully.
 Many of the popularizers of the phrase “believe women” have climbed down to simply saying that women’s accusations should be heard and then evaluated in light of the facts.
 In other words, what any fair-minded person has maintained throughout the #MeToo era, including during the Brett Kavanaugh battle.
 And yet there is still progressive outrage over the new Title IX rules developed by DeVos that seek to bring balance and fairness to the consideration of accusations against people who aren’t the presumptive Democratic nominee for president of the United States.
 The actor/activist Alyssa Milano, an erstwhile vocal advocate of “believe women,” has now modulated her view to accommodate her continued support of Biden. She explains that we need to shift our mindset “to believing women. But that does not mean at the expense of giving men their due process and investigating situations, and it’s got to be fair in both directions.”
 This is an unassailable position, and one that obviously has implications for the Title IX debate. Even if it doesn’t entail supporting every particular of DeVos’ reforms, it should mean an openness to them. Nonetheless, late last year Milano slammed DeVos over the proposed changes in highly personal terms.
 The upshot of Milano’s inconsistency is that a famous and powerful man, whom she happens to know and support, should get more consideration than a young, politically powerless, unknown student somewhere.
 A piece from Vox on what “believe women” means in the context of Reade’s allegation quoted Sage Carson, manager of an advocacy organization called Know Your IX. According to Carson, the concept has been twisted “into this idea that you never provide a fair process for folks to go through.”
 OK. But her organization has declared war on DeVos’ changes.
 An article in Mother Jones reported that anti-sexual assault activists still supporting Biden have a number of reasons. One of them is “an eagerness to replace Trump’s cabinet, including Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, whose overhaul of campus sexual assault policy has prompted outcry from survivors.”
 In other words, Biden gets the benefit of the doubt on Tara Reade explicitly as a means to continue to deny the accused on campus any such benefit of the doubt.
 The DeVos changes are meant to inject elementary fairness into proceedings that went off the rails in response to Obama administration guidance in 2011. Students punished by these kangaroo courts have had considerable success appealing their cases in the courts.
 The DeVos rules reverse the single-investigator model that empowered one person to investigate a case and recommend a decision.
 Now the investigator and adjudicator must be different. Students must have access to evidence, and the accused must know what is alleged and by whom and when.
 There must be a live hearing and an opportunity for cross-examination by both sides.
 Title IX coordinators and investigators can’t be biased one way or the other.
 These measures are so in keeping with basic American traditions that it’s hard to believe that anyone could oppose them.
 The ultimate irony is that Joe Biden was a prime mover behind the Obama-era Title IX rules. As Robby Soave of Reason magazine notes, “If the allegation against Biden were being decided by the kind of adjudication system that he helped enshrine on college campuses, it’s quite likely that he would be found guilty.”
 There’s a lesson there, although it’s doubtful anyone — emphatically including Biden himself — is willing to learn it.

Logic offered a different perspective on the Hawkeyes. She stayed with Cahill at the hospital the day she broke her fibula, about an eight-hour stay. When she began her recovery, only able to move on crutches, Logic served as Cahill’s hands at the grocery store.
 There was still a little rivalry there, though. When IU and Iowa faced off this past season, Cahill and Logic made a bet: If their school lost, they would have to wear the other’s college gear to the next day’s shoot-around.
 Unfortunately for Cahill, the No. 15 Hoosiers blew a double-digit, second-half lead and fell by two points in overtime, 71-69. She’s not getting used to wearing black and gold, but Cahill can definitely call one Hawkeye a friend.
 “Sam’s an awesome person and a really good player,” Cahill said. “Coming back (from the injury), we worked out together every day, game-like drills to get back in the flow.”
 Cleared for practices in mid-December, Cahill didn’t skip a beat upon her return in January. She logged 40 minutes, producing 19 points and eight rebounds. In the next game, she was 8-of-12 from the field on her way to a 24-and-11 outing.
 Once, Logic tried taking a charge and ended up falling onto Cahill’s surgically repaired fibula. A thought crossed the forward’s mind, but slower than it would have if she was playing tentatively.
 “I started running back to the other end and I was thinking, ‘That could have been really bad.’ That’s how I got hurt,” Cahill said. “But it didn’t bother me at all.”
 What became more alarming was the spread of COVID-19 in Europe, particularly in Italy. For the Americans playing in Luxembourg, there was a question of whether they would be able to return, especially after President Trump announced restrictions on flights from Europe.
 He didn’t make it entirely clear U.S. citizens could return.
 “So all of us were asleep that night and we woke up to a text from all of our agents that we were going to be stuck there,” Cahill said. “They were debating whether to cancel the season, which they did a few days after that. So that was kind of hectic for a couple of days.”
 Cahill made it back to Ohio, though, where she’s visiting with family. While there isn’t basketball, she has filled her days with hobbies.
 She’s learning to sew. Cahill recently made a T-shirt quilt with some of her old IU gear. She’s learning how to play the keyboard, too, trying to work through the frustrations that arise when she adds her left hand into the mix.
 But she isn’t done shooting with her right hand. Whenever women’s basketball returns in Luxembourg, Cahill intends to head back.
 Eventually, yes, Cahill will move onto the teaching-coaching tract she has set out for herself. But until then, there is a men’s coach in Luxembourg who coordinates subbing for a nearby international school, which puts Cahill in a classroom regularly. This past season, she coached a sixth- and seventh-grade girls’ team on weekends.
 There’s a language barrier, but it’s surmountable. Cahill can demonstrate drills and then hammer home a few key words. Cahill’s players know “form” at this point, which she uses to stress left foot, right hand on a layup, and vice versa.
 “They were all really sweet girls. They want to listen and try their best,” Cahill said, though she couldn’t claim to be leading a powerhouse. They were an inexperienced bunch, just beginning to grasp the fundamentals.
 “We did OK,” Cahill added. “I think we ended up finishing in the middle (of the standings), which was better than most thought we would, because we were a young team.”
 When Cahill heads back to Luxembourg, it will be for one more year than she thought. But it’s well worth it.
 “I still enjoy playing and I still enjoy traveling when I’m over there,” Cahill said. “So it will be fun, and I’m looking forward to another year.”

Washington, May 13 (AP) Paul Manafort, Donald Trump's onetime presidential campaign chairman who was convicted as part of the special counsel's Russia investigation, has been released from federal prison to serve the rest of his sentence in home confinement due to concerns about the coronavirus, his lawyer said Wednesday.
 Manafort, 71, was released Wednesday morning from FCI Loretto, a low-security prison in Pennsylvania, according to his attorney Todd Blanche. Manafort had been serving more than seven years in prison following his conviction.
 His lawyers had asked the Bureau of Prisons to release him to home confinement, arguing that he was at high risk for coronavirus because of his age and preexisting medical conditions. Manafort was hospitalized in December after suffering from a heart-related condition, two people familiar with the matter told The Associated Press at the time. They were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.
 Manafort was among the first people to be charged in special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation, which examined possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia in the 2016 election campaign.
 Manafort, who was prosecuted in two federal courts, was convicted by a jury in federal court in Virginia in 2018 and later pleaded guilty in Washington. He was sentenced last March and was immediately hit with state charges in New York that could put him outside the president's power to pardon. New York prosecutors have accused him of giving false information on a mortgage loan application.
 Manafort's release comes as prison advocates and congressional leaders have been pressing the Justice Department for weeks to release at-risk inmates ahead of a potential outbreak. They argue that the public health guidance to stay 6 feet (1.8 meters) away from other people is nearly impossible behind bars.
 Attorney General William Barr ordered the Bureau of Prisons in March and April to increase the use of home confinement and expedite the release of eligible high-risk inmates, beginning at three prisons identified as coronavirus hot spots. There are no confirmed coronavirus cases at FCI Loretto.
 As of Tuesday, 2,818 federal inmates and 262 BOP staff members had positive test results for COVID-19 at federal prisons across the country. Fifty inmates had died.
 The bureau has given contradictory and confusing guidance how it is deciding who is released to home confinement in an effort to combat the virus, changing requirements, setting up inmates for release and backing off and refusing to explain how it decides who gets out and when.
 An agency spokeswoman said more than 2,400 inmates have been moved to home confinement since March 26, when Barr first issued a home confinement memo, and more than 1,200 others have been approved and are in the pipeline to be released.
 Manafort's release was first reported by ABC News. (AP)

“Me and Charles, we just looked at each other. We’re almost grown men and we just started laughing. Like ‘Oh, my God, THERE HE IS!’ I didn’t want to look at him. Charles didn’t want to look at him.”
 The players eventually settled down. “Once you break the ice with Mike, you realize he’s just like you,” Johnson said. “He loves competition, he loves the game. He even gave me a pair of his patent leather Air Jordans. He gave me them off his feet. He really was uplifting to me, took me under his wing, gave me a lot of confidence not only in basketball but anything I did. And when you touch greatness, you always want to achieve that standard.”
 Johnson had come off a season during which he had been injured and gained a lot of weight, ballooning up to around 275 pounds.
 When he started playing at the Jordan Dome, he had dropped to 215 pounds. “Michael taught me how to transition to the perimeter, pick and roll. When we played, there were 10 guys on the floor, nine NBA players and Kris. I constantly had to show my worth, constantly play at a high level.
 “And Michael was not playing any differently than he would play with Scottie Pippen. Michael is very hard on you, and if you don’t have the mental fortitude to deal with that, you will break, as a player and as a person. It takes a strong person to deal with Mike. He got in my (expletive). It wasn’t, ‘Oh, you’re Marques’ kid. Oh, you’re only a sophomore at UCLA. ‘
 At the time, Jordan was trying to get back into basketball shape himself, preparing for the coming NBA season after taking a year and a half off to play baseball. There was a method to playing with college kids.
 Said Johnson, “What Michael wanted to do that summer was work out and also expand his game. It was a great situation for him. He gets to nurture and bring along a college kid and tap into that side of his brain that is not slapping Steve Kerr around in practice and being a little kinder and talking you up and coaching you.”
 Jordan set up sudden-death game situations in which he would rely on Johnson to shoot the potential game-winning shot from the corner. “He would pass the ball to me, and, I’ll tell you the truth, ask my dad or anyone else who was there, I’d hit that shot more than not. Nothing made Michael happier. He would love me when I hit that shot.

A secondary problem, as Romer has explored in tandem with bioethicist and medical doctor Zeke Emanuel, is that could be testing the wrong people. The vast majority of current Covid-19 testing in the US is being used for diagnostic purposes, to tell if someone who’s sick is infected with the virus. This may have made sense in February, when lots of people had the sniffles and few people had Covid-19. But right now, you don’t need a test if you’re sick; rather, you should stay home and self-isolate — unless you’re worried you might need to be hospitalized, in which case you need a pulse oximeter to test your blood oxygen levels, not an RNA test for the virus.

 “The state already provides a lot of support for cities and counties,” he said. “And so I would just suggest that there are a number of enforcement mechanisms that are available to us, and I don’t want to utilize those — I have asked people to do the right thing and I want to point out that the vast majority of people in Illinois have been doing the right thing and I’m so very proud of that.”

Boxes are stacked everywhere on new flooring. Track lights illuminate a utility ladder, newly painted walls and decor, and large windows give onto Main Street, all at the site of Osterville Mercantile, a brand new business in the village center, adjacent to Osterville House & Garden.      The new store is waiting for the lifting of coronavirus restrictions for the official "OK" to move on toward opening.
 What's inside all those boxes? The makings of what James Cote, owner of Osterville House & Garden, calls a "modern general store" in progress, co- owned by Cote and his wife, Megan, and housed in a space connecting to the hardware business that Cote has owned for a decade.
 It will be "a little bit of everything, just with a modern twist," is how James described the new business he and Megan are getting ready to open.
 Of the store's genesis and development, he said, "We've been planning this for about a year-and-a-half." Business closures due to COVID-19 restrictions have "slowed the progress" a little, he said, but now "We're just waiting for the ban to be lifted."
 Asked about what the new store will sell, James said planning for the inventory has been "on our minds for quite a while." From running the hardware store, he said, "We had a good sense of what we had to send people out of town for," and they have set themselves to make such goods available in the new space, "filling a need" for people in the village.
 According to the Cotes, it's a "totally new business" that will sell kitchen supplies, toys, educational games, hats, books, clothing and bags, an array of skin care products, and a selection of what James calls "tried and true" food provisions, such as olive oils, special bread, pancake and other mixes and a line of candy.
 The existing House & Garden store that sells building supplies, hardware and housewares totals about 7,500 square feet. Adding the new store will bring the total retail area to a little over 10,000 square feet. Well before Cote bought the house and garden business in 2010, he said, an earlier hardware business on the site originally took up both spaces. "So we'll bring it back to its old glory," he said.
 Since hardware is classified as an "essential" business, Osterville House & Garden has remained open, providing supplies for area contractors and serving what James described as "homeowners stuck at home doing projects."
 "We have been very fortunate" to remain open, James said.
 The space on Main Street now occupied by the Cotes' business also once housed the old Osterville Village Library, and the couple said they want to "carry on that tradition" by bringing in a selection of books, including reading and activity books for kids and a selection of cookbooks for adults, all displayed in an attractive alcove.
 "We want to sell things that we feel strongly about," said Megan, and another store area, set off by a high decorative window, peaked roof and exposed rafters, is set to be a kids' area that carries toys, art supplies and games and offers space for kids to play.
 The Cotes arrived at the unfinished store to have a picture taken for the article, and brought their own three children, Quinn, 5; Helena, 2½; and Tommy, four months. The two oldest are already at home in the new space, and were pictured in a recent video the couple posted online to let villagers and customers know about new store. The Cotes are making use of online platforms to keep people informed of their work in progress.
 "We are really looking forward" to moving ahead with the opening, James said.

Edinburgh, (APP - UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 13th May, 2020 ) :First independence. Then Brexit. Now Scotland's handling of the coronavirus outbreak has stirred up fresh tensions with the UK government, despite an initial unified approach.
 The leader of the Scottish government, Nicola Sturgeon, has put clear water between Edinburgh and London by refusing to implement the same easing of lockdown measures.
 At the weekend, she warned lives could be at risk if stay-at-home restrictions were lifted too soon, just before British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a plan for a gradual return to normality.
 Johnson's ruling Conservatives have been criticised in the crisis, particularly for a lack of widespread testing and the supply of protective equipment for frontline workers.
 The prime minister has also been questioned about his claim to have stopped the outbreak successfully, when more than 32,000 people have died \-- the second-highest in the world.
 But in Scotland, where figures released on Tuesday showed just under 2,000 deaths from nearly 14,000 positive tests, Sturgeon is perceived to be doing a good job.
 A YouGov poll last week indicated 71 percent of people were confident Sturgeon would make the right decision, compared to just 40 percent for Johnson.
 The approval rating comes on the back of indications of an increase in support for her Scottish National Party (SNP).
 \- 'Russian roulette' - The latest crack in fragile relations between the UK government and the devolved administration in Edinburgh mostly centres around messaging.
 Until Sunday, the UK-wide advice to the public was "Stay at Home" to avoid transmitting the virus and stop the state-run National Health Service being overwhelmed with cases.
 But Johnson changed the slogan to "Stay Alert" as he sketched out plans to open up the economy again to certain sectors, after passing the peak of the outbreak.
 "I don't know what 'stay alert' means," Sturgeon told reporters at the weekend.
 "If I say to you, my message now is stay alert and you say to me, but does that mean I stay at home or not, and I can't give you a straight answer, I am failing in my duty to be clear in terms of what I'm asking you to do." She argued rates of transmission were still too high in Scotland and kept restrictions in place.
 "Let me be very blunt about the consequences if we were to do that. People will die unnecessarily," she added, later saying she wouldn't play "Russian roulette" with lives.

Susan Sarandon and Catherine Deneuve play star-crossed lovers whose fates become intertwined in what photographer and artist Deborah Bright recalls as "one of the absolute BEST lesbian love scenes in mainstream film." Beautifully sublime sets, art directed by Clinton Cavers with Stephen Goldblatt's cinematography, elevates the horror genre into a poetic artifice of decadence and decay. Commended for its queer themes at the height of the AIDS epidemic, Bright saw this movie soon after coming out and found this "visually over the top, very noir, and creepy" cult favorite resonating with her and other "adventurous lesbians."

Decades ago, America started down the road of creating two economic worlds. Our once-mighty brick-and-mortar economy went into decline and began to be exported overseas, to cheap labor zones and countries with less-stringent environmental laws — places that, as economist Larry Summers infamously put it, were “vastly underpolluted.” That American factory workers would be left behind by this process was just their bad luck, another thing requiring a “suck it in and cope” attitude.

While cruise lines have announced cancellations of trips and restrictions on who is allowed to travel, they have not acknowledged the systemic and corporal disregard for their employees, which has facilitated this crisis. As a result, errors in the quarantine process and in government response continue to be repeated. Reports from crew members amid the coronavirus outbreak have showcased the need for labour rights in the often elitist cruise industry, but cruise lines have so far made no effort to change their practices to prevent the problem rather than simply treating the symptoms.

The former Auburn wideout averaged over 20 yards per reception on 26 catches with Jarrett Stidham at quarterback back in 2017. Hastings is a big-play threat from the slot with impressive burst and transitions on vertical routes to create separation down the field. He also possesses above-average lateral agility to stack moves together at the line of scrimmage to get away from press corners. He also has some of the typical shiftiness at the top of routes for a slot receiver, which was on display when he ran a 6.41-second three-cone at his pro day. Hastings and Stidham had chemistry when they overlapped at Auburn. But the UDFA wideout sat out the 2018 season due to a torn ACL, and durability is a concern with his smaller frame. At 5-foot-10, 175 pounds, Hastings’ arm length doesn’t register on an NFL scale at a shade over 27 inches, limiting his catch radius. Hastings also lacks experience on special teams, making it more difficult for him to make the roster. Still, he’s a dynamic route runner that adds a vertical element to the slot.

 LONDON, May 13 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A university professor has launched a computer game called "Can You Save the World?" to help children understand how social distancing can save lives during the coronavirus pandemic.
 Richard Wiseman said he came up with the idea for what is thought to be the world's first COVID-19 computer game after going for a walk during lockdown in Britain and finding it "felt like a computer game" as he dodged pedestrians and cyclists.
 Wiseman, a professor of psychology at the University of Hertfordshire, said research showed that games which encourage positive social behavior can influence people's actions in the real world.
 "It's a fun way of getting quite a scary message across," said Wiseman, who created the game, which has already gone viral, with designer Martin Jacob.
 "There's quite a lot of research showing that if you get people - kids in particular - to behave in certain ways in video games it really does transfer to real life."
 The creators, who are now looking at developing an app, say governments, schools and health authorities could use the game to encourage social distancing - a key measure to keep the virus in check as countries emerge from lockdown.
 "It seems to me probably more effective than some of the scary announcements we're getting because it gets in under the radar, particularly with kids," said Wiseman.
 Players control an avatar through an increasingly busy street and "save lives" by avoiding pedestrians, cyclists and people sneezing - all of whom are surrounded by exclusion zones.
 They can also collect masks and drop them off for health workers to save extra lives.
 The aim is to save as many lives as possible. As the game progresses, the score starts accelerating to demonstrate that by protecting yourself you are protecting many others.
 TOILET ROLLS
 Wiseman, who is also a member of Britain's Inner Magic Circle of top magicians, said about 15,000 people had played the game since its launch on Friday.
 Although conceived for children, adults are also playing and posting pictures on Twitter.
 "It has gone viral. It feels like it has chimed with people," said Wiseman. "It's a way of talking about these things with kids without it being all doom and gloom."
 The game has humourous touches with players also able to scoop up groceries including toilet rolls, which were in short supply at the start of lockdown as shoppers stripped supermarket shelves.
 "If you're lucky enough to come across a toilet roll then you whiz through the game for a while at super speed," Wiseman said. "Toilet rolls are very rare - just like real life."
 If a player bumps into someone, they lose points. Too many collisions get them "confined" and the game ends.
 The highest possible score is 7 billion lives saved - about the size of the world population.
 The top score so far is 2 billion, but Wiseman confesses he is a long way off.
 "For me it's about 1,000 - I'm ridiculously bad at my own game." (Reporting by Emma Batha //news.trust.org)

MOSCOW (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 13th May, 2020) The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) is working with partners to prepare isolation, treatment and quarantine facilities, as well as intensive care units (ICU), in Bangladesh's Rohingya refugee camps in case the COVID-19 disease spreads there, Louise Donovan, UNHCR spokesperson in the city of Cox's Bazar, told Sputnik.
 Bangladesh, the most densely populated country in the world, also hosts the world's largest refugee camp near Cox's Bazar. To date, there are over 16,600 COVID-19 cases in Bangladesh.
 "UNHCR and partners are working round the clock to establish response capacity in the event of an outbreak. UNHCR has almost completed the construction of two Isolation and Treatment facilities (ITCs) which will be used to treat severe cases amongst the refugee and local population. Other humanitarian partners are also constructing similar facilities," Donovan said.
 The spokesperson noted that the agency had also established quarantine facilities throughout the camps and provided support to existing health facilities in the area with training, personal protection equipment and other resources.
 "UNHCR is supporting the national hospital in Cox's Bazar to establish an Intensive Care Unit, which will be operational shortly, with 10 ICU beds and 8 high dependency beds," Donovan said.
 She noted, however, that it was likely that a virus outbreak would spread very quickly in the refugee camps, given their huge population and overcrowded conditions.

SC in a closed hearing on January 16 dismissed Airtel, Vodafone Idea and Tata Teleservices' plea that they had filed back in November asking the court for a review of its October AGR ruling. Airtel and VIL have said they are likely to file curative petitions with January 23 due date impending in sight. The rejection to extend any help to carriers could potentially lead to a two player industry, analysts believe. VIL being left in the lurch could be seeing exiting the industry as KM Birla has previously said.
 Tariff revisions are believed to take the sector towards recovery, however, more clarity on where exactly the industry will be headed to will come post January 23 deadline of paying AGR compensation.
 Additionally, ahead of the Union budget coming on February 1, the industry which is being weighed down by multiple taxes and levies has reportedly asked the government for aid in the form of reduction of regulatory levies, taxes and license fees with lower interest rates to access credit.

TYLER, TEXAS (KLTV) - The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way we do many everyday things. One of them is going to the doctor. “I think it’s going to be a bigger and bigger part of healthcare going forward,” said Dr. Sam Bagchi, Chief Clinical Officer for CHRISTUS Health. Dr. Bagchi is talking about telemedicine. It’s like going to the doctor, without actually going to the doctor. You can do it using a computer equipped with a webcam or even your smartphone. Some visits can even be done with nothing more than a phone call. “What the COVID-19 pandemic has done is accelerated some of the Medicare and other private payer coverage of these services to now be more comprehensive, since it allows people to avoid face to face communication and potential infection,” Dr. Bagchi said.At CHRISTUS, Bagchi said these virtual visits have rapidly expanded primary care. In some cases, up to 20% of visits are now done virtually. “I think some of the advantages are the ease of access, the lower cost of not having to navigate traffic, or parking. Those are all pros,” Dr. Bagchi said. But he said there are some patients and conditions that still warrant an in-person visit to a clinic or hospital. “It’s not for everybody,” Bagchi said. “And it’s not for every condition. There are clinical specialties and procedural based caregivers that need in- person visits to really get an understanding of what’s going on with a patient.” Another disadvantage is that you likely don’t have access to the same tools your doctor does, like devices that can look down your throat, ears, and in your eyes. “I think that’s where we’re spending a little more time,” Bagchi said. “It’s not necessarily a con, but somewhere we need to spend a little more time and do more investment and development.”Whether you call it telehealth, telemedicine, or virtual care, some say this new normal could be the next normal.“It was a trend that was happening anyway, and now I think it’s going to be a trend that happens even faster,” Bagchi said. “I think ultimately it’s going to be good for patients and good for the health of our communities.” Copyright 2020 KLTV.
