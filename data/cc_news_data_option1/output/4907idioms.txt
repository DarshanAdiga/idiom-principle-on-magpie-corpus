A member of the House of Representatives, Ahmed Satomi, who represents the Jere Federal constituency of Borno, said at least 44 burials were taking place Sunday.
 “Farmers and fishermen were killed in cold blood. Over 60 farmers were affected, but we only have so far received 44 corpses from the farms and we are preparing for their burials today, Sunday by God’s grace,” the federal lawmaker said.
 Boko Haram and a breakaway faction, the Islamic State West Africa Province, are both active in the region. Boko Haram’s more than decade-long insurgency has left thousands dead and displaced tens of thousands. Officials say Boko Haram members often force villagers to pay illegal taxes by taking their livestock or crops. But some villagers have begun to resist the extortion.
 Satomi said the farmers in Garin Kwashebe were attacked because they had disarmed and arrested a Boko Haram gunman on Friday who had been tormenting them.
 “A lone gunman, who was a member of Boko Haram came to harass the farmers by ordering them to give him money and also cook for him. While he was waiting for the food to be cooked, the farmers seized the moment he stepped into the toilet to snatch his rifle and tied him up,” he said.
 “They later handed him over to the security. But sadly, the security forces did not protect the courageous farmer. And in reprisal for daring them, the Boko Haram mobilized and came to attack them on their farms.”
 Insurgents also torched the rice farms before leaving, he said.

 ROME, Nov 30 (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi's biggest sovereign fund is in talks with U.S. firm KKR to invest in Telecom Italia's (TIM) last-mile network in a deal that has drawn scrutiny from Italy's government, three sources close to the matter told Reuters.
 Rome typically welcomes foreign investments but demands assurances that investors will follow the country's national interests. The government has special vetting powers to block unwanted bids in industries deemed of strategic importance.
 TIM agreed in August to sell KKR a 37.5% stake of a newly created company, FiberCop, into which it has transferred its 'last-mile' network connecting street cabinets to people's homes.
 KKR now wants to sell up to 30% of the unit that will hold that stake to Infinity Investments, a subsidiary of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA), as it looks for co-investors in the Italian deal, the sources said, asking not to be named.
 Abu Dhabi would then hold up to 11% of TIM's last-mile grid, provided the government authorised the deal.
 "ADIA would be an indirect and passive investor," one of the sources said.
 The Italian Prime Minister's office, TIM, ADIA and KKR all declined to comment.
 Italy's industry ministry has informed the cabinet office of KKR's plans, and a technical body in charge of scrutinising foreign investments in strategic Italian assets plans to hear TIM's views on the matter in early December, the sources added.
 Rome this month gave its conditional green light to KKR's acquisition of the last-mile network stake, demanding that the firm commit to a government- sponsored plan to create a unified ultra-fast broadband network.
 The government wants TIM to merge its landline grid, running from switching centres to households, with rival Open Fiber, which is jointly controlled by utility Enel and state lender Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP).
 Infinity Investments and KKR notified the government following the first clearance to the FiberCop deal, the sources said.
 Co-sharing an investment is a normal practice funds use to reduce risks.
 Australian fund Macquarie is considering the possibility of syndicating the purchase of a minority stake in Open Fiber from Enel, people familiar with the matter told Reuters last week.
 The move has irked CDP, which does not want potential co-investors to have governance rights, one of the sources said on Monday.

I have a wise friend who happens to be very sensitive about the word, 'blessed.' Her point is well-taken; very often, in the innocence of speech, we seem to equate being 'blessed' solely with good things in life. Following this logic, I suppose that to be 'blessed,' is something akin to being lucky, like choosing the right lottery ticket.
   
 Think about your own understanding of that word, 'blessed.' How often have you or I said in response to the news of something special in our lives, 'I'm so blessed.' But what about when things aren't so good for us? What happens when we encounter a tragedy in our life, our family, or even in our world, such as the pandemic? Are we still 'blessed'? And if we're not blessed, then what are we? Are we cursed?
   
 To equate blessings solely with good things and curses with bad things seems to represent an Old Testament view of God, and one which doesn't seem to leave room for the message of Jesus in the Gospels. The Beatitudes of Jesus (in Matthew's and Luke's Gospels) provide evidence of that. The word, Beatitude means 'supreme blessedness', but we find the ancient root of the word in what we understand as extreme happiness, ecstasy or blissfulness.
   
 Is anyone feeling blissful about where the pandemic seems headed? Yeah, me neither; but I also would argue that every one of us, even those most affected by the virus, are blessed beyond measure.
   
 In this Thanksgiving week when we've celebrated our blessings, perhaps it's good to step back and take stock of just what Jesus intended in giving us his Beatitudes. Though it would be easy to over-complicate, the point is actually rather simple. Jesus is trying to help us detach our blessings from things external to us. Rather, we're blessed simply because we are children of God, period. If we're open to that level of detachment, then even those who are poor, downtrodden, and hurting in spirit are still blessed; those who have lost loved ones, or have suffered significant losses are still blessed.
   
 Indeed, Jesus insists, we are not just blessed SOME of the time, but rather, we are blessed at ALL times. We don't have to BE good, or HAVE good, or EXPERIENCE good to be blessed. We are blessed because of our awareness that God is in our midst. Though that notion may be foreign to us, it offers great freedom to those who feel as though they aren't worthy of God's love and blessing.
   
 So in the spirit of celebrating our blessedness, I offer a new beatitude: Blessed are we when we free ourselves to accept that we are blessed, no matter what.

Conclusion
 In a market that seems to overvalue technology stocks and way overvalue growth without profit, one has to wonder why the market is discounting a technology company that is still growing at impressive rates with actual profits. At $78/share, one could easily argue this company is still reasonably priced, and if the stock falls below $70/share this stock looks like a very good deal with a good amount of margin of safety to boot. If iRobot can maintain it's position as the leading high-end robotic vacuum maker, add sticky service revenue, as well as other products with growing demand like robotic lawn mowers, then this company could be a steal at these prices.

Remember, in the example above, a married couple laid out $500,000 to receive about $2,500 per month. There is no risk for them in that monthly payment. However, the risk for them is early death, at which point the insurance company wins. Using the Yield Hunting Core Portfolio, that $500,000 could earn over $3,500 in income streams per month. The biggest difference isn't the $1,000 plus per month received, it's the fact that the initial $500,000 will still be yours!
 Full disclosure - going back to the PTY chart, it could mean that the $500k is now worth $250k, but it may also be worth $750k.
 But as a retired income investor, the capital appreciation and/or price fluctuations of the fund should be the last thing you think about. It is the consistent income streams the fund is providing you to live on, on a monthly basis.
 The last point to make on this is that many funds are not 'buy and hold'. By having a CEF expert guide you along the way, you can swap out of one fund and into another when the opportunity strikes. This could help investors avoid a distribution cut, or a fund that has a similar payout but less risky basket of securities, lowering your overall risk exposure. Or it could be to a similar fund that has a usually large discount where a capital gain opportunity is present. Small moves create small gains - but they can make a big difference in the long term, increasing both your monthly cash flows as well as your overall portfolio balance.

Folarin Balogun has emerged as the next big talent to come out of the Arsenal production line.
 The young Englishman has been scoring goals for fun in the club’s youth team.
 In his last game for the Arsenal first team, he scored his first senior goal within the first two minutes with what was his first touches of the game.
 The teenage striker has announced himself with that goal, and as the club looks to sign him on to a new deal, it seems that he will be a part of the team into the future.
 Arsenal has a wealth of talent in their attack at the moment, and it was previously thought that Eddie Nketiah was the one blocking the path of Balogun to the first team.
 However, I think that Alexandre Lacazette has been the culprit as the Frenchman continues to struggle for goals.
 Strikers score goals, and if one doesn’t score the goals needed, then they will have to be sidelined.
 If Arsenal can manage to integrate Balogun into their first team and the teenager starts scoring the goals that the team needs, then they have to think about getting rid of Lacazette.
 The Frenchman has entered the final two years of his current deal at the Emirates, and it makes no sense to have two strikers that are over 30 in your team when you have youngsters that need game time.
 What Arsenal should be doing now is to start grooming our younger strikers to do what Lacazette does for the team, then we can cash in on him in the summer transfer window.

We huffed and puffed but Reading looked the more likely to score and having passed up a couple of great chances with more heroics from Bentley they eventually did get a third and again it was as a result of more poor defending.
 Taylor Moore played a poor pass in the middle of the pitch and then Han-Noah Massengo failed to stay on his feet and went to ground, the ball was played into the impressive Joao and he swiveled and found the corner of the net. It was no more than Reading deserved. We were poor and Dean needs a response from his players. We had poor performances right throughout the side with only Bentley getting anywhere near the level needed.
 We shouldn’t go overboard with the criticism, we are still in a great position but you also can’t hide from the fact that we were poor and need to address the intensity and creativity.

The Spaniard had replaced Arsene Wenger just 18 months before but an alarming slide in form saw him lose his job.Mikel Arteta was targeted as the new incumbent and took the reins on December 20 and here, the PA news agency looks at what has changed in the year since Emery&rsquo;s departure.A case for the defence One of the priorities for Arteta when he replaced his compatriot was to address defensive frailties that were being exposed on a regular bases.In Wenger&rsquo;s final season, the Gunners produced a shot difference of +170, but 13 games into Emery&rsquo;s final season it had dropped to an alarming -56.With the savvy signing of Gabriel Magalhaes and a more structured approach to defending getting more out of players such as Shkodran Mustafi and David Luiz, Arteta has – by and large – shored things up at the back.Victory through harmony Arsenal&rsquo;s club motto – Victoria Concordia Crescit – calls for unity to bring about success.Arteta inherited a squad that was at a low ebb following a string of poor results under Emery, who had also stripped Granit Xhaka of the captaincy after he swore at supporters during a game at the Emirates Stadium.Xhaka has since gone on to wear the armband on a number of occasions under Arteta, who united a frustrated fanbase with their players and went on to guide Arsenal to a record 14th FA Cup after just nine months in charge.Structural damage addressed With Wenger&rsquo;s autonomy replaced by Emery in a head coach role and a structure in place above him, Arsenal were aiming to move to a completely new way of working.The model, however, fell apart as key members departed. Head of recruitment Sven Mislintat and Ivan Gazidis who, as chief executive, led the search to appoint Emery, were the big-name exits.There has been more upheaval since with head of football Raul Sanllehi also leaving but, with Vinai Venkatesham working as chief executive, Arteta – now manager and not head coach – works closely with technical director Edu in what appears to be a much clearer structure.Squad goals While sorting out issues in the defence was key for Arteta, it has become clear of late that those solutions have only caused problems at the other end of the pitch for the Gunners.Only the bottom four sides in the Premier League have scored fewer goals than Arsenal&rsquo;s total of 10 this season, with Gabriel&rsquo;s header in Sunday&rsquo;s defeat to Wolves the first time they had struck from open play in almost eight and a half hours.Captain Pierre- Emerick Aubameyang has been in fine form ever since he moved to the club in January 2018 but he has only scored one penalty in his last nine league outings, with Arsenal having 95 shots across their 10 matches so far.Positional sense Such a goal-shy run has made it hard for Arsenal to pick up points on a regular basis at the start of the current campaign.Aubameyang&rsquo;s aforementioned penalty gave them a 1-0 win at Manchester United but they have lost their last three home league games and currently sit 14th in the table, already eight points adrift of north London rivals Tottenham at the summit.When Emery was sacked, Arsenal had just drawn 2-2 at home to Southampton, leaving them eighth in the table – the same position they would end the season once Arteta had taken charge.How&rsquo;s your luck? Arteta has had to deal with plenty of unexpected issues in the first 11 months of his managerial career.The coronavirus pandemic meant supporters will only return this Thursday for the first time in nine months, while a number of injuries have also played their part of late.None of those injuries prove a streak of bad luck as Thomas Partey. The transfer deadline day signing had missed just six matches throughout his entire career before joining Arsenal, but he has now sat out the last two games with a thigh injury which Arteta admits will rule him out for the next &ldquo;few&rdquo; fixtures.

RATIONING INITIAL DOSES
 If the FDA allows emergency use, Moderna expects to have 20 million doses ready for the U.S. by year's end. Recipients will need two doses, so that's enough for 10 million people.
 Pfizer expects to have 50 million doses globally in December. Half of them -- or enough for 12.5 million people -- are earmarked for the U.S.
 This week, a different panel of U.S. experts, established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, will meet to decide how initial supplies will be given out. They're expected to reserve scarce first doses for health care workers and, if the shots work well enough in the frail elderly, for residents of long-term care facilities. As more vaccine gradually becomes available in coming months, other essential workers and people at highest risk from the coronavirus would get in line. But enough for the general population isn't expected until at least spring.
 Outside the U.S., Zaks said significant supplies from Moderna would be available later, "in the first quarter" of next year.
 "Obviously we are doing everything in our power to increase the capacity and accelerate the timelines," he said.
 Both Moderna's and Pfizer's vaccines are made with the same technology, using a piece of genetic code for the "spike" protein that studs the virus. That messenger RNA, or mRNA, instructs the body to make some harmless spike protein, training immune cells to recognize it if the real virus eventually comes along.
 ASTRAZENECA CONFUSION
 AstraZeneca last week announced confusing early results of its vaccine candidate from research in Britain and Brazil
 That vaccine appears 62% effective when tested as originally intended, with recipients given two full doses. But because of a manufacturing error, a small number of volunteers got a lower first dose -- and AstraZeneca said in that group, the vaccine appeared to be 90% effective.
 Experts say it's unclear why the lower-dose approach would work better and that it may just be a statistical quirk.
 A larger U.S. study of the AstraZeneca candidate still is underway that should eventually give the FDA a better picture of how well it works. The FDA has said any COVID-19 vaccine would have to be at least 50% effective.
 Meanwhile Britain's government will have to decide whether its U.K. data is sufficient for an early rollout there.
 STILL IN THE PIPELINE
 Johnson & Johnson also is in final-stage testing in the U.S. and several other countries to see if its vaccine candidate could work with just one dose.
 Both the J&J and AstraZeneca vaccines work by using harmless cold viruses to carry the spike protein gene into the body and prime the immune system.
 The different technologies have ramifications for how easily different vaccines could be distributed globally. The AstraZeneca shots won't require freezer storage like the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.
 Candidates made with still other technologies are in late-stage testing, too. Another U.S. company, Novavax Inc., announced Monday that it has finished enrolling 15,000 people in a late-stage study in Britain and plans to begin recruiting even more volunteers for final testing in the U.S. and Mexico "in the coming weeks."
 Vaccines made by three Chinese companies and a Russian candidate also are being tested in thousands of people in countries around the world.

So be it, Laca is one of the worst strikers to start for Arsenal - worse than Giroud, Chamak, Walcot. Maybe marginally better to Sonogo or Park or Perez.Good riddance when it happens.

Democrats have battled with Republicans and the White House for months over a fresh installment of COVID relief that all sides say they want. But a lack of good faith and an unwillingness to embark on compromises that might lead either side out of their political comfort zones have helped keep another rescue package on ice.

The Arsenal captain has only scored once from open play this season - and that came on the opening day of the season against Fulham, and there are concerns that his poor form is affecting the Gunners.
 But former England international Barnes believes Aubameyang has never been a player that could win a game on his own - like Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi - and that his Arsenal teammates must also take responsibility for their performances.
 "Aubameyang is not by himself going to save Arsenal, he’s not a Messi or Ronaldo in their heyday, so he would have to be part of a team," Barnes told BonusCodeBets.co.uk.

The club's highest recent finish in the Premier League came in the 2015/16 season when they ended up second behind shock title winners Leicester.
 Included amongst that season's squad were Mikel Arteta himself, Tomas Rosicky, Jack Wilshere, Mesut Ozil, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Aaron Ramsey, Santi Cazorla, Alex Iwobi and Alexis Sanchez. Each and every one of these players was capable of creating a game-winning chance for the team.
 Arsene Wenger's problem was not finding players who could form opportunities for his strikers, but rather how to fit as many of them into his starting XI as possible.
 Just five years later and the club have a squad composed of nine centre backs - William Saliba, Sokratis, Gabriel, Rob Holding, Shkodran Mustafi, Calum Chambers, Pablo Mari, David Luiz and Dinos Mavropanos \- and no registered senior central attacking midfielder.
 To be fair to Arsenal the increased focus on defending has worked to an extent.

Castro had a tough choice; it was a forced choice. He chose not to be an American puppet. He chose to serve the interests of the Cuban people, warts and all. Why should he have chosen to serve the interests of the Americans when the Americans chose not to serve the interests of the Cubans when they had a chance and choice? What is good for the goose is good for the gander. It is embodied in Trump's "America First" mantra. For Castro it was "Cuba Frist". What is wrong with that? Obama recognised this in reference to Cuba. Every nation is entitled to sovereignty and self-determination.
