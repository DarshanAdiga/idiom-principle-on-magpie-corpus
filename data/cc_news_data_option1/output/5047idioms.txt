“When my husband died, Jean took me under her wing,” Jensen said. “I would say, ‘I’m not an artist.’ What it’s done is open me up, and has me being more creative and thinking about things. That’s when I got into whimsical things.”
 And the artist is Verona rosemaler Jan Norsetter, also a friend, from whom Jensen said she’s always received a lot of encouragement.
 But over a decade ago Jensen left behind the flowers, leaves and scrolls of her rosemaled trunks and chairs. Since then, she’s focused on two figures in her art – snowmen and birds.
 Her foray into drawing birds resulted from a practical joke played by Hylland. One day, Hylland placed a ceramic bird onto a bird feeder outside of Jensen’s home.
 As the bird kept falling over in the wind, Jensen brought it inside. Staring at the clay fowl, inspiration struck Jensen. She got out her watercolors and painted the bird colorfully and fancifully.
 When her husband passed away in 2014, Jensen said she “just kind of quit” making art for a while as her grief led her to lose interest. Now the stoneware songbird brought back the itch to paint. She prefers watercolors to the oil paints she used to do rosemaling.
 “Watercoloring is more free, it flows all over the place,” she said.
 Painting that three-dimensional ceramic bird led Jansen to a new hobby of painting imaginary birds on paper.
 “They’re whimsical birds, I don’t know what depiction they are – they’re fantasy birds, crazy, not real looking,” she said. “I like using bright colors mostly – blues and greens – but all the colors are good.”
 Jensen had come to believe that she was not capable of creating anything out of her imagination. Now that she has awakened her imagination, it has become active. The world around her inspires her whimsical beings.
 “Rosemaling was a lot of fun and I loved it, but It was more limiting,” she said.
 Now she sees faces in old boxes lined up outside her home. She gets ideas from cracks in sidewalks or reflections in passing cars.

We knew there would be pre-match menus to show players the rules of the match. As well as post-match menus to show what happened afterward. We tried cramming as much information onto these screens as possible - the cards and gold you earned, the reason the game ended, and all the options for what could happen next. Eventually, the majority of this information was streamlined and stripped away to avoid overwhelming the player.

Double arrows were one of the only special arrow types prototyped on paper. They could push single arrows around, but treat other double arrows as equals. This was the simplest escalation we could imagine. We toyed with how arrows could be handled inside a given row or column- should they add up their power or stack up? Ultimately, we decided to keep simplicity! The strongest arrow in a row/column would be what combatted your placed card.

It was a pretty straightforward process to recreate our paper card game prototype! Once we had our no-frills version up and running, there were a lot of kinks to work out in regards to displaying what was happening. How would we show a card being pushed? How would you know whose turn it was and if you were winning or losing? We kept these questions in mind as we progressed towards fleshing out the final layout.

Positive impressions were substantially less common among Black and Latino residents and among residents of South L.A. While more than 65% of white respondents reported having “mostly positive” experiences with the LAPD, only about 28% of Black residents and 37% of Latino residents reported the same. Nearly 38% of Black respondents reported having “mostly negative” experiences.
 A full 30% of Black respondents said they could never trust their local LAPD officers to do the right thing, compared with just 4.2% of white respondents, 5.7% of Asian respondents and 9.8% of Latino respondents.
 The Study LA survey, which claimed a 2.5% margin of error, was conducted over the phone, online and in person between August and October. Respondents answered questions in multiple languages and were surveyed in various parts of the city.
 Members of the Police Commission lauded the survey as providing critical analysis that will help inform the department on issues it needs to address.

This complicated concept was made crystal clear by using imagery of a propeller flipping the cards over with its wind. This ability was deemed too powerful to use repeatedly (like a Bomb Arrow), so it was restricted to only work on the initial push. Cascade arrows turned out so great! It's tremendously satisfying to flip over your opponents' cards and achieve a Gem Sweep.

Rick Barnes thought he was in the clear early in his bout with COVID-19. The Tennessee coach should have known better, given his texts with Tom Izzo, his Michigan State counterpart who also went through it. About a week into his quarantine, Barnes lost his appetite and started feeling lethargic. Just like Izzo said. “He gave me full warning,\" said Barnes, who is 66 and has been a head coach the past 33 years. “He texted me almost every day — just don’t be surprised when this stuff happens. And I would tell you, it probably took me 12 days to where I felt really good.” Barnes, Izzo and Syracuse’s Jim Boeheim are among the coaches 65 and up who have contracted COVID-19, which can be a greater threat the older one is. While many elderly people are isolating at home, college basketball coaches are required to travel, work indoors and be around crowds — all among the most risky behaviors amid a pandemic. Lon Kruger knows he is taking a chance. Oklahoma’s 68-year- old coach has been spared so far, even with his Sooners having to briefly shut down because of cases within the program. He said hearing about his colleagues got his attention. “It’s just a reminder to do what we can to avoid it,” Kruger said. “Not to say that anything’s 100% guaranteed. But the university continuously reminds us to be careful and follow the recommendations. Especially with the masks. It’s a pretty easy thing to do to wear a mask.” Dr. George Monks, president of the Oklahoma State Medical Association, said fans wearing masks, washing and sanitizing their hands, and keeping their distance from others when they are away from the arenas will play a key role in protecting coaches — even with attendance at games limited or barred altogether. “We need to all do our part...

And their outspoken efforts are getting cheers from anti-border wall activists in South Texas who want other neighboring counties to follow suit.

According to the panel, police and prosecutors often turn to “snitches” when they don’t have enough evidence to close a case.

In our spreadsheet, we decided who would and wouldn't be made into a Joustus card. In the end, almost every character made the cut (excluding an enemy or two, and some village NPCs that did not appear in King of Cards. Variations of most common enemies like Wizzem and Goldarmor did not make the cut!).
