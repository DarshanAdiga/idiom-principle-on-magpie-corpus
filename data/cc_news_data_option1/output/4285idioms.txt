Like the Gomes’, there are others who similarly revisited suspended projects. Prasanna Pai’s The Coastal Rasoi had been in the works for a few years, and this year, she had the time and the backing of her daughters to finally start selling her food, which includes Mangalorean dishes like ghee roast, urval and sukka, and some Goan dishes. Brothers and dancers Josinho and Shawn Fernandes utilised their free time to realise the dream of owning their own place. They started Chef Seralins selling snacks, special menus featuring Goan, Italian and pan-Indian food, and even full meals.
