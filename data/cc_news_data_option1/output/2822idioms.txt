Nearly two centuries later, the Republican and Democratic parties still confirm their presidential nominees and solidify their platforms at conventions held during the summers before November presidential elections. Now, the one-city, top-of-the-ticket focus is a choice, not a necessity, and the intended audience isn’t the party faithful in the arena. Instead, every video, graphic and speech is crafted for television, every sound bite drafted for Twitter.
 As the coronavirus crisis continues, the Democratic Party is scaling this year’s Milwaukee-based event, including asking delegates to stay home. Officials in Jacksonville, Florida, the host city of President Donald Trump’s Republican extravaganza, announced safety precautions in light of the surge of COVID-19 cases.
 The changes raise the question of if the traditional convention is the best use of time and money. The answer is no. The country is not served by conventions made for national television; we need a revamp made for voters.
 A prime-time focus on the election isn’t the problem, though two days would be better than four. It’s the substance that needs updating.
 We have a voting problem in America: not enough people do it. In 2016, turnout was just more than 61%. For young people it was even lower — 46% — and Asian Americans and Latino citizens consistently vote at disproportionately low rates as well. The effort and coverage dedicated to the conventions could be used better to increase voter turnout by informing citizens about the races on their ballot and educating on the electoral process.

College Station Utilities and Bryan Texas Utilities are resuming disconnections due to nonpayment following almost four months of suspending the practice in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Director of Fiscal Services Mary Ellen Leonard said that CSU disconnected 35 locations on Thursday, and 14 of those customers made a payment and were reconnected the same day. Vicki Reim, BTU division manager of customer operations, said just under 60 customers are on Monday’s disconnection list, and she expects that number to drop as people make payments over the weekend.
 Both representatives said their utilities shut off electricity due to nonpayment but will not turn off someone’s water.

In a phone interview Friday evening, Vasquez said she has been concerned in recent weeks about the spike in COVID-19 cases and the economic and public health impacts of the virus on the residents of her precinct and the county as a whole. She said she did not want to see people who are being encouraged to stay home for safety reasons lose their place of residence because of pandemic-induced economic hardship.
 “I’ve been monitoring our COVID-19 emergency and how it’s impacted us locally. Quite frankly, I have been really alarmed at the growth of our numbers,” Vasquez said. “It’s not safe for people to be moving out and about. If people are supposed to be staying home as much as possible, but they don’t have a home to go to, then we’re putting them more at risk — and all of us.”
 In addition, Vasquez noted, the Bryan ZIP code 77803 currently has the highest number of COVID-19 cases, at 933 total since the start of the pandemic. Of the 60 new coronavirus cases announced Friday, 23 were in 77803, which is part of her precinct. Of the total cases in Brazos County, 45.6% are among Latino or Hispanic individuals, and nationally, Black communities have also been disproportionately impacted by the virus, Vasquez said.
 “I don’t think it’s bold at all [to suspend evictions] — I think it’s my responsibility as an elected official,” Vasquez said.

I like to say that I use topics like style, food, travel, and beauty as gateway drugs. Once I've landed a spot on your feed, I then share the serious stuff. Nearly 800,000 people die by suicide in the world each year, which is roughly one death every 40 seconds. Suicide is the 2nd leading cause of death in the world. I am passionate about lessening those statistics--even if it's by one person. Life is really stressful. Stress can turn into anxiety and anxiety can turn into depression and depression can lead to suicidal thoughts. When I show up on someone's phone, I want to make sure I use that moment to make them smile, laugh, feel a little lighter, less alone, excited to make future plans, empowered, encouraged, or understood. Everything I post is inspired by this mission.
