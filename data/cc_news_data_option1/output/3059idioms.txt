Cartellino rosso per chi tossisce in campo deliberatamente: il calcio al tempo del Coronavirus si adegua, inserendo nel suo regolamento anche una norma per «procurato allarme». La novità è stata confermata dalla commissione della Federcalcio inglese, incaricata di stilare le regole del calcio, in linea con le indicazioni ricevute dall'International Football Association Board (Ifab). Dalla prossima stagione tossire in campo in maniera forzata, ovvero non spontaneamente, verrà equiparato ad altre infrazioni, come insulti o gesti osceni rivolti ad avversari o direttori di gara. Tutti comportamenti che - a discrezione arbitrali - possono anche essere sanzionati con l'espulsione diretta. «Se il colpo di tosse è chiaramente accidentale, l'arbitro non prenderà alcun provvedimento - ha dichiarato un portavoce della Ifab -, così come nel caso accada in situazioni di grande distanziamento tra i giocatori. Viceversa il comportamento del giocatore dovrà essere considerato anti- sportivo».

But making these kinds of meaningful changes won’t be effective if they come _before_ the unlearning process, and I think this is where many companies fall short. Spurred by urgency from their employees and customers, companies quickly put policies in place without doing the hard work of unlearning first. For example, if an organization designs a new D&I initiative without first examining past mistakes or getting input from Black people and people of color within the company, the organization could get it wrong again. It could end up facilitating tokenism, or having one or two Black people or people of color amid a mostly white workforce. Tokenism implies a lack of inclusivity and can even be harmful to these employees, who are more likely to (paywall) experience depression and stress and tend to be less satisfied and committed to their jobs.

Ma, 26, is one of almost nine million people graduating and entering the job market this year at a time of great uncertainty, an issue that has the ruling Communist Party worried to the point that President Xi Jinping has made it a priority.
 The world´s second-largest economy may have rebounded sharply from a historic virus-induced contraction, but its young graduate jobless rate in June was more than three times that for urban unemployment.
 Ma was among hundreds of young faces streaming in and out of the job fair on a recent weekend in Zhengzhou, where employers in industries ranging from real estate to manufacturing were recruiting.
 Like many others, the aspiring teacher is "at a loss" and wondering if she should settle for any job or hold off work for further education. "I have applied to seven or eight private schools, but only one has called me back for an interview," she told AFP at the fair.
 "I´ve studied for so many years and don´t want my family to pay for further training," she said. "I´m especially worried about my finances." Aware of the risk that mass unemployment can spark political unrest -- jeopardising the party´s pledge of prosperity in return for unquestioned political power -- the government has been making efforts to boost graduate employment via state- owned enterprises (SOEs).
 But poorer opportunities this year are pushing some into further studies, less ideal jobs or other options.
 Although China´s economy appeared to make a strong comeback in the second quarter -- growing 3.2 percent on-year -- analysts caution the rebound may be overestimated, with a gap re-emerging between national figures and higher- frequency data.
 Louis Kuijs of Oxford Economics told AFP there is no doubt China is recovering, but the magnitude would determine if growth is "strong enough to re-absorb some of the labour market problems" that emerged earlier this year, such as layoffs.
 A gap in growth of a few percentage points could lead to a difference of millions of jobs created, he added. Although China´s urban unemployment rate slipped to 5.7 percent in June, 19.3 percent of new graduates remained jobless, UOB economists said in a report, adding the labour market "continued to face challenges".
 Top-level economic data has not necessarily meant better hiring on the ground. A 27-year-old surnamed Kang, who graduated in 2017, is back in the market after his contract in the communications industry in Beijing ended.
 He decided to return to Zhengzhou, but has only received around five callbacks after sending more than 30 resumes to firms -- and is still looking for a job. "The virus outbreak has limited travel and a lot of job fairs have been postponed or cancelled," he said. "I´m extremely anxious."
 Lu Yifan, 25, said the pandemic had caused many overseas Chinese students like him to return home sooner than planned -- adding to the flood of jobseekers. And Guangdong graduate Zhao Jingying, 22, told AFP: "For us (this year), getting a single job offer is a feat."
 Another, Beijing-based Huo Ruixi, 23, left university in July but is planning a second round of further education after an unsuccessful five-month job search. The crisis is also causing problems for employers. Yang Changwei, manager at Deyou Real Estate, told AFP at the Zhengzhou fair it was getting harder to hire sales staff based on commission.
 "It feels like jobseekers´ mindsets have shifted," he said. "In sales, you may or may not make deals but with other jobs there can be more stability in income. Because of the epidemic, financial pressures are larger as well."
 Officials are ramping up efforts to boost graduate employment, and Premier Li Keqiang announced over nine million new roles will be created this year. A State Council guideline in March said smaller firms that recruit graduates with contracts longer than a year will be given a subsidy, while SOEs will "continuously expand" the scale of graduate-hiring this year and next.
 Henan authorities, for one, said at least half the recruitment positions at SOEs within the province should be reserved for this year´s graduates, while Nanjing city in Jiangsu province set aside one billion yuan ($143 million) to provide 100,000 internships for struggling graduates, Xinhua news agency reported.

WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Three men have been rescued from a tiny Pacific island after writing a giant SOS sign in the sand that was spotted from above, authorities say.The men had been missing in the Micronesia archipelago for nearly three days when their distress signal was spotted Sunday on uninhabited Pikelot Island by searchers on Australian and U.S. aircraft, the Australian defense department said Monday.The men had apparently set out from Pulawat atoll in a 23-foot boat on July 30 and had intended to travel about 27 miles to Pulap atoll when they sailed off course and ran out of fuel, the department said. Searchers in Guam asked for Australian help. The military ship, Canberra, which was returning to Australia from exercises in Hawaii, diverted to the area and joined forces with U.S. searchers from Guam.The men were found about 118 miles from where they had set out."I am proud of the response and professionalism of all on board as we fulfill our obligation to contribute to the safety of life at sea wherever we are in the world," said the Canberra's commanding officer, Capt. Terry Morrison, in a statement.The men were found in good condition, and an Australian military helicopter was able to land on the beach and give them food and water. A Micronesian patrol vessel was due to pick them up.SOS is an internationally recognized distress signal that originates from Morse code.Copyright 2020 Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The latest pack contains at least six pups, according to the Graubünden Hunting and Fishing Authority. The sighting adds to the 35-40 wolves in the canton, with some 80 believed to be roaming Switzerland.
 The first pack was sighted in 2012 in the Calanda region of Graubünden, signalling the return of breeding wolves to the alpine country.
 The growth in numbers of the predator has resulted in mixed feelings between environmentalists and farmers. Last month a pair of wolves were blamed for killing 19 sheep in a single weekend in the neighbouring canton of St Gallen.
 Swiss voters are set to have their say on hunting reforms on September 27, after an intervention by animal protection campaigners.
 They are protesting against recent legal amendments to the Swiss hunting law which would make it easier to hunt protected species such as wolves, bears and ibex to prevent property damage or danger to humans. The amendments permit targeted individual shooting and provide for a transfer of decision-making powers from the federal government to the country’s 26 cantons.

It should go without saying that as part of an effective approach to complaint management, organizations need business rules (how complaints are handled) and data (contextual information surrounding a particular complaint and customer). Yet the challenge for most organizations is putting those rules and data into action. For rules, this means consistent execution and enforcement. For data, it means getting it out of systems and silos so it can help inform decisions.

Recognizing patterns provides organizations with several opportunities. First, they can address the root cause directly — for instance, correcting a product fault or better training an employee. If the root cause is not correctable (or if that correction takes time), sales, marketing and support organizations can be armed with the necessary information and offers to prevent or mitigate complaints going forward.

According to official statistics released on Monday, the collection of sales tax at import stage was at Rs67.29 billion during July 2020 as compared with Rs59.26 billion in the same month of the last year.
 Collection at import stage also registered eight percent in July 2020 as compared with Rs64.15 billion in June 2020. FBR officials attributed the growth in sales tax revenue at import stage to ease in lockdown that was imposed to prevent spread of the novel coronavirus.
 Tax authorities were facing significant shortfall in monthly revenue collection since the imposition of lockdown in March 2020. The lockdown partially halted all economic activities, including port activities.
 Besides, global trade has also witnessed slowdown in the wake of the pandemic. Domestic demand also trimmed, which resulted in lower imported goods. However, as infection cases started declining the government decided to open up the commercial activities with imposition of smart lockdown in those areas where large number of cases were reported.
 Large Taxpayers Unit (LTU) Karachi has jurisdiction to report sales tax collection collected by customs stations at sea ports in the city. According to the details, Model Customs Collectorate (MCC) Port Muhammad Bin Qasim made major collection of Rs28.15 billion during July 2020, which was seven percent higher when compared with Rs26.36 billion in the same month of the last year.
 MCC Appraisement Ease registered 16 percent growth in sales tax collection to Rs21.14 billion in the month under review as compared with Rs16.3 billion in the same month of the last year.
 MCC Appraisement West posted 20 percent growth in sales tax collection to Rs9 billion as against Rs10.8 billion during the comparative period. However, the sales tax collection registered 30 percent decline by MCC Jinnah International Airport (JIAP) during the period due to reduced flight operations.
