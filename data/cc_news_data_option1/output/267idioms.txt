As observed in Josh Levine’s book Pretty, Pretty, Pretty Good, Sour Grapes may have been inspired by Larry David’s own sudden Seinfeld wealth (he made a reported $250 million in 1998 from syndication). The overall premise of “How would getting rich change you? And how would it change the people around you?” is hung on the classic Larry David approach of deconstructing everyday interaction and etiquette, breaking the taboos of social convention by confronting things that would normally be too skin-crawlingly awkward to say out loud.

Because super savers benefit from the magic of compound interest, they are especially loathe to pay it to someone else. They may borrow to make a purchase that is likely to increase in value (such as a home), but they will not borrow to buy something that wonât increase in value (like an article of clothing). High-interest debt is out of the question.Â

“This level of intrusiveness seems like a very unfair bargain in return for, say, 20 cents off a can of corn,” Fordham’s Reidenberg said.
 To be sure, all large supermarket chains stockpile customer information. Whole Foods, owned by data-hungry Amazon, says in its privacy disclosure that it collects reams of data in the name of “providing customer service.”
 Albertsons has similarly broad data-collection practices, including “demographic information, citizenship and work history information.”
 But these disclosures apply to all possible interactions with the company, including applying for or landing a job with the supermarket.
 Where Ralphs has misstepped is in not making that distinction and linking all its snooping solely to the company’s rewards program — that is, they’re asserting a right to give Ralphs Rewards cardholders the same in-depth scrutiny they might give a credit card or job applicant.
 In theory, you’re contractually agreeing to this all-encompassing level of data collection in return for a few discount coupons.
 Votava, the Ralphs spokesman, acknowledged that the company has indeed staked out a right to a huge amount of customer data as part of joining Ralphs Rewards.
 But he said the more sensitive areas, such as health and credit information, are applicable only to using a Ralphs pharmacy or applying for a Ralphs credit card.
 “We could have made that clearer,” he said. “This is a very valid reason to rethink this.”
 Here’s another: Ralphs shoppers, and those of other Kroger chains, may not know that the company has a subsidiary with the nondescript name of “84.51.” It’s devoted solely to using customer data as a business resource.
 “We use a proprietary suite of tools and technology to uncover relevant customer patterns, and are committed to helping clients develop, nurture and embrace customer-driven relationships,” the 84.51 website says.
 Votava said 84.51 — the name is derived from the longitude of the Cincinnati headquarters — uses non-identifying aggregate data to help food companies reach out to shoppers.
 Color me skeptical, but if Kroger has set up an entire business centered on exploiting customer data, it’s hard to believe this is all perfectly benign — particularly in light of the fact that the company is apparently eager to know not just what I buy but also where I work, what I do online and where I go throughout the day.
 84.51 unveiled a new service, dubbed Stratum, last July. Paying clients in the food and beverage industries can receive “data captured from brick and mortar as well as online transactions,” and “draw conclusions that are representative of consumer behavior nationally.”
 “Simply put, data is our most valuable asset,” Stuart Aitken, chief executive of 84.51, said in a statement. “With Stratum, we have created a groundbreaking product, which will dramatically change the way our brand partners plan and execute their marketing and merchandising budgets.”
 Votava insisted to me that neither Ralphs nor Kroger ever sell personally identifiable customer data. All customer information shared with marketing partners is anonymous, he said.
 I asked how customers can know that for sure, considering Kroger has an entire business dedicated to profiting from customer data.
 “That is not who we are,” Votava replied.
 It’s a fact of modern life that all businesses we interact with are creating digital files on us. California’s new privacy law will help cast some much- needed sunlight on these practices.
 But at this point it’s still a guessing game as to how much data is being collected and how it’s being used.
 “Consumers may be getting some benefits in return, but they are giving up much more in value to get those paltry benefits,” said Jay Kesan, director of the Program in Intellectual Property and Technology Law at the University of Illinois.
 Seems like even more sunlight is in order.

“We worked hard to negotiate with the lawyer representing the class to reach an agreement that we collectively believe is fair for the class members,” Riot spokesperson Joe Hixson wrote in a statement to The Times. “Now DFEH is trying to disrupt that agreement in a legal filing that is filled with inaccuracies and false allegations.”
 “We are particularly dismayed that the filing downplays and ignores the efforts we have made with respect to diversity, inclusion, and culture over the past 18 months,” Hixson continued. “We look forward to making our case to the Court.”
 The suit arose in the wake of a series of exposés on the company’s culture, beginning with an article from the games website Kotaku, and laid out allegations that Riot fostered a “men-first” “bro culture” that failed to punish or control harassment.
 It described inappropriate behavior such as “crotch-grabbing, phantom humping, and sending unsolicited and unwelcome pictures of male genitalia,” and said women who spoke out received “denied promotions, refusals to provide increased compensation or equal pay, demotions, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, losses of benefits, suspensions, terminations, and other adverse employment actions.”
 Supposed procedural mistakes lie at the heart of another state agency’s opposition to the settlement. In late December, the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement filed a request to officially intervene in the case, arguing that lawyers for the women who worked at Riot failed to do their due diligence in coming to the settlement, and that the terms of the settlement let Riot off the hook for potential labor law violations beyond the initial purview of the lawsuit.
 That objection hinges on a specific California law. Thanks to the 2004 Private Attorneys General Act, employees and their lawyers are allowed to bring suit against employers for violating labor law — legally stepping into the shoes of an official state agency to bring the case. But as part of that power, the employees and their lawyers have to inform the state agency that they’re bringing a suit, and offer the state agency first dibs at pursuing the case itself. In the case of the Riot suit, the DSLE is claiming that the original notice for equal pay violations was misfiled, and that the settlement clears Riot of any potential wrongdoing for unrelated violations over issues such as overtime and minimum wages.
 Lawyers for Riot and the plaintiffs argue that the DSLE is wrong, having mistaken the terms of an earlier draft settlement for the narrower terms of the final settlement, and that the case is procedurally sound.
 The fate of the state’s attempted intervention will be decided at two hearings. On Jan. 31, the court will decide whether to grant DSLE the right to intervene in the case, which will allow the agency to engage in its own discovery and litigation against Riot Games for labor code violations as part of the same suit.

To the officers I talked with back then, they were collateral damage in a war that was saving lives by tamping down gang violence — a war that even the LAPD brass seemed to think justified whatever shortcuts officers took to keep gang members off the streets.
 I see echoes of that era in this scandal today. It’s bigger than a handful of cops fudging the facts to keep their numbers up.
 It spotlights flaws in the process of building intelligence on gang members that dates back to the 1980s, when Los Angeles was, like many cities, in the throes of a gang war fueled by drug dealing. Cracking down trumped down civil liberties. Hundreds, maybe thousands of people across California have unfairly been labeled gang members since.
 Then, as now, to officially label someone a gang member, police officers need to satisfy two criteria from a list that includes attire, tattoos, location, arrest record, associates, self-admission and the word of a reliable source, which could be another officer.
 “Self-admission” has always been a particularly convenient tool because, until the advent of body cameras, it’s been difficult for an alleged gang member to disprove. Its power is rooted in the officer’s credibility.
 And it’s not only the LAPD that’s been capitalizing on that. A 2016 audit of CalGang, the state’s official repository of gang members’ names, found that more than 40 people listed in the database would have been less than 1 year old when they were added to the roll. And 28 of those babies were entered for “admitting to be gang members.”
 To his credit, Chief Moore is bothered by that too. The gang database can only be a valuable tool, he said, if it reflects the integrity of police officers and earns the confidence of the community.
 “It’s well intended, but not well executed in some parts of the city,” Moore admits. “At this point we have got to have a better way of understanding gangs and making the connections we need.”
 Changes are underway on the state level, he said. And locally, the unfolding scandal in the LAPD is already leading to more accountability. Now body cam footage is being routinely reviewed and compared with officers’ reports of their field interviews before anyone is added to the gang database.
 That’s a prudent and practical first step, given that an officer’s credibility is the single most important element in the gang member designation. But what still needs doing is a cultural fix that’s more challenging and absolutely essential.
 This doesn’t seem to me to be shaping up as “a few bad apples” thing. We have to ask what it means when officers on one of the department’s most prestigious teams don’t even bother to align their accounts with what they know their body cameras are recording.
 Moore is wrestling with that question too. And he’s unequivocally pledged to get to the bottom of this, root out offending officers and make changes to the system so it’s less likely to net innocent people.
 “I want to determine quickly just how deep this goes,” he said. “Did they slant things because we’re measuring their work? That’s no excuse. These are police officers, they’re not seventh-graders.”
 If officers believe they have to cheat or lie, either something is very wrong with the department, or they’re not fit to be police officers.

The low price means NBCUniversal will be relying primarily on advertising. Live cable and broadcast TV viewers are already used to ads, so making the switch to internet-based programming will be a cinch. All of this implies Peacock is aimed at being a sort of bridge between traditional TV and streaming. Do bear in mind, though, Comcast doesn't need Peacock to be a runaway success like Netflix or Disney+. Comcast makes the bulk of its money on high-speed internet, and that isn't going to change anytime soon. Three- quarters of the company's profits came from the cable communications segment in 2018, which includes TV, internet, mobile phones, and related services. Through the first nine months of 2019 reported so far, cable communications still accounted for two-thirds of the company's profits -- which includes the addition of the European Sky business that Comcast acquired a year ago.

Wang Pao, 35, who works in the service industry, said he had donned a gray surgical mask for his journey to Hebei province as a precaution against catching the virus. He said he feared it would spread with the millions of journeys taken by his fellow Chinese.
 “It’s the new year, so people are traveling all over the country,” he said.
 Near a bank of automated ticket dispensers, a man in a white mask said the virus could easily take root in Beijing.
 The man’s friend Hu Qihao, wearing a black mask, said he also was uneasy about the virus.
 The two were headed to nearby Hebei province on the slow train, which would take four hours — but at least they had bought reserved seats.
 “Beijing already has cases of the pneumonia,” said Hu, 21, who works at a liquor store.
 Taiwan on Tuesday reported its first confirmed case of the virus, brought in by a Taiwanese woman who was recently in Wuhan, according to the island’s Central News Agency.
 Memories of the SARS outbreak, which killed nearly 40 people on the island, are still fresh, said Lee Chun-yi, a legislator representing parts of the southern city of Tainan.
 About 850,000 Taiwanese live in China, government figures show, with many typically returning home to spend the new year holiday with family.
 Chiu Cheng-hsun, a professor and physician in Linkou Chang Gung Hospital’s pediatric respiratory department, said the island is vulnerable because of its proximity to China and the flow of business travelers and tourists to the mainland.
 “Given this kind of background, if prevention is not done well, Taiwan could be the first place to be hit,” he said.

Reading the title of this column you might think it is an advertisement for the sale of a long term care insurance policy. It isn't. In fact, it is just the opposite. Much of what follows is very personal with me, perhaps too personal to be published in newspapers across the country. Too bad. Readers need to be aware of some of the hazards related to long-term care insurance policies. Let the insurance folks sue. As a boxing commentator used to say, "I tell it like it is."      On the national level we talk a lot about universal insurance coverage, the next generation after Obamacare. We all need to remember that insurance companies are in the business of taking in premiums. Unfortunately, they are exceedingly adept at not paying out claims. The end result for people who need help from their insurance companies to handle the ever higher prices for medical services is a constant fight to get some of their money back when insurance coverage is needed.      Twenty years ago when my wife and I were approaching 60 years of age we made what we thought was a prudent decision to help cover future necessities for health care as we aged. We bought a long-term care plan for each of us. The cost? We have paid the carrier approximately $220 a month for almost two decades. If you are counting that is approaching $40,000.      Today, we need their help. My wife has stage 4 cancer that she has been fighting for almost two years. We could use the long-term care coverage we have been paying for. Unfortunately, they say she does not meet the requirements in the fine print of the policy. As is generally true, the devil is in the details and the details are in the fine print. There is a cover sheet that says whenever the doctor testifies that she meets their necessities we will have 90 days to wait before payments can begin. That is pretty standard and my signature is at the bottom of the page where the 90-day waiting period is noted. The monthly coverage is $135, not quite enough to cover a monthly rate at a local assisted living unit but enough to be helpful.      What is not there and is nowhere I can find on any document with my signature on it is the requirement that my wife be unable to feed or dress herself prior to applying for the coverage. I am sure I didn't agree to that but it is certainly in the fine print that they have sent me to justify their decision not to begin payments. Reason tells me that such a requirement makes no sense. By the time a person cannot feed or dress herself, one can assume that the end will not be long in coming. In many communities, Hospice, a free service, will have stepped in with their services and taken over helping take the person toward their end.      So, did I do a dumb thing 20 years ago and agree to pay $40,000 for something that is simply not feasible? I don't think so, but proof is not on my side. They have the money and the lawyers to fight whatever resistance they receive from me.      So, what is the solution to my problem? In truth, there may not be one. My purpose for writing this column is to warn those who don't have such policies not to buy and those who do to read the fine print. A good alternative is to take the amount that the policy costs and put it in the bank each month in a savings account. When you need it, perhaps 30 years down the road, it will be there for your use and you will not have to fight with anyone to get the help you need.   You can reach Dr. Mark L.
