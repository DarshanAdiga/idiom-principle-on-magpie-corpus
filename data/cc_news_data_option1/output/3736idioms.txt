Pitt is still trying to find its primary running back for the 2020 season and Vincent Davis is making a strong case to be the guy this year. He has now been Pitt’s leading rusher in three straight games dating back to last season. Davis also has has the most career touchdowns among the running backs with seven.
 Davis rushed for 47 yards and two touchdowns last week, and his play caught the eye of Pitt head coach Pat Narduzzi the most of the five running backs that saw the field in Pitt’s 55-0 win over Austin Peay.
 “You got to make people miss,” Narduzzi said. “That was one thing I saw Vince do, which we saw him do it last year. He's a good back.”
 Davis believes he has grown as a player from his freshman season to this year. He credits that to having a better understanding of the offense from second- year offensive coordinator Mark Whipple. The sophomore running back gained that knowledge in the offseason by learning the offense virtually. He believes the growth is true of all the other returning backs as well.
 “It was the same guys, it’s just we weren’t mature enough,” Davis said of the running game struggles from last season. “Now this year I feel like we’re very mature. We understand more and understand what we have to do and understand the others around us and that’s the difference I think in us.”
 Powell agreed with Davis’ assessment about the newfound knowledge in the running back room.
 “Well Vince was a good player as a freshman,” the Pitt running backs coach said. "He got hurt and it set him back, but the biggest difference between Vince and all of the guys is how much knowledge they’ve acquired.”
 The college football offseason was unique to say the least. Pitt used that time to focus on understanding the game over Zoom meetings, not just memorizing plays. Davis and all the backs now understand their objectives on each play, rather than just knowing what they have to do.
 “So through all of the Zoom meetings that we’ve had when we couldn’t be in front of them, we really focused on raising the knowledge of our players, and I think particularly the guys in my room have done a good job,” Powell said.
 Powell has three primary objectives he looks for his guys to do each week. He wants his guys to protect the football, protect the quarterback, and extend plays. Powell believed his guys were good in the first two categories on Saturday, but would like to see more big runs from his guys moving forward.
 “So we did not extend plays as well as I would have liked to have seen and that’s one area we will continue to work on,” Powell said on Tuesday.
 The running backs need to get better in that last category overall, but Davis did display the most ability to find extra yardage on Saturday. There was another area where Pitt needed to show improvement this year and that was scoring in the red zone. The Panthers did just that on Saturday by scoring six rushing touchdowns inside the red zone. For Davis and all the other backs, that was a point of pride heading into this season.
 “I’m just going to let you know now, you’re going to see more touchdowns in the red zone,” Davis explained. “Everybody just has a better understanding this year. Everybody knows what’s going on, no one is lost and we have a second year under our belt with Coach Whip.”
 The Pitt running back room is still crowded heading into Saturday's game with Syracuse, even if Davis posted the best numbers last week. Senior A.J. Davis earned the start last week. Israel Abanikanda, Daniel Carter, and Todd Sibley all scored touchdowns against the Governors. For now, Davis is happy to share the work load with the others.
 “It feels good being able to have guys you can rely on, guy you can lean on,” Davis said of his fellow backs. "If anything happens to one of us, we can look to the next person and know that we can rely on the next guy and we can put the next guy in.”
 Even in that crowded room, it appears it will be Davis getting that first opportunity on Saturday. Pat Narduzzi revealed on Thursday that Davis will be the starter for Syracuse, and what he did against Austin Peay played a big role on that.
 "We’ll play them all and see what they’ve got, but Vince is the guy that showed up last week, so he’ll start," Narduzzi said.

California public health officials said Thursday, Sept. 17, that if a county falls to the lowest tier of its state reopening system, schools in the county that have not reopened will lose their chance to reopen.
 “If a school did not open while the county was in the red tier, and the county subsequently moves to the purple tier, that school will not be able to open for in person instruction, until the county has returned to the red tier and been in the red tier for two weeks,” the California Department of Public Health said in an email to the Union-Tribune Thursday, Sept. 17.
 That news is likely to devastate parents and schools in San Diego County, where a surge in COVID-19 cases among San Diego State University students is pushing the county closer to dropping from the state’s red tier to the lowest, purple tier.
 In the purple tier, schools are not allowed to reopen, but elementary schools can apply for a reopening waiver.
 Schools that have already opened while the county was in the red tier, however, will be allowed to stay open, according to state guidance.
 If San Diego County does fall to the purple tier next week, it will throw a wrench in the plans of several local school districts that have already announced plans to reopen schools in the coming weeks.
 Also it will likely disappoint parents who have been waiting to send their children back to school and who have already been told by their school districts that they will be able to return.
 Poway Unified, the county’s third-largest district, announced last week that it will begin opening its elementary schools on Oct. 1. Several districts, including Vista Unified and Oceanside Unified, also were planning to reopen for all students next month. And Grossmont Union High School District was planning to open on Sept. 28.
 Only a handful of school districts — including Del Mar Union, Rancho Santa Fe and Cajon Valley Union — are already open. Many private schools are open; they were the first in line to apply to for waivers to reopen.
 Many school districts have opted to reopen more slowly to avoid making mistakes, or to wait until COVID-19 levels decrease.
 The virus has hit south county and south San Diego disproportionately, and school districts in those areas, including San Diego Unified, have said they must wait to reopen until it becomes safer for students and staff to return to school.
 The county learned Tuesday, Sept. 15, that its state-determined daily new COVID case rate per 100,000 residents is 7.9. If the county’s daily new case rate again posts at above 7.0 on Tuesday, the county will fall to the purple tier.
 Once a county qualifies for that more restrictive tier, the county has three days to implement closures or sector changes, according to state guidance.
 Even if San Diego County falls to the purple tier, however, schools that have not reopened will still be able to bring students with high needs onto campus for limited, small, in-person support sessions, according to state guidance.
 Districts like San Diego Unified, Poway, Chula Vista Elementary and Vista were already planning to bring high-needs students to campus for similar small, in- person support sessions before reopening for all students.

For weeks there has been confusion among local school leaders about whether they would still be allowed to reopen if San Diego County falls to the purple tier.
 Some written state guidance has said that schools that have already reopened can remain open, but should increase COVID-19 testing of staff if their county falls to the purple tier.
 In a Sept. 9 webinar, California’s acting State Health Officer Erica Pan told educators that schools that have not yet reopened while in the red tier should not reopen if their county falls to the purple tier.
 “That would concern us that the county is back to levels of transmission that we don’t necessarily want schools to reopen at that time,” Pan said.
 San Diego County officials, meanwhile, have been telling school leaders for days that schools will still be allowed to reopen even if the county falls to the purple tier, even though some school leaders have referenced the Sept. 9 webinar to county officials.
 “If we were to go back to tier one ... this is not going to affect your decision to go forward,” said Gary Johnston, the county’s chief resilience officer, to educators in a Zoom meeting on Tuesday, Sept. 1`5.
 San Diego County’s school reopening FAQs also claim that schools’ ability to reopen would not be affected if the county fell to the purple tier.
 There has been little clarity about this issue partly because no California county has fallen from the red tier to the purple tier. San Diego County would be the first county to do so since the state debuted the tier reopening system at the end of August.
 County officials have unsuccessfully tried to convince the state to exclude SDSU’s coronavirus cases from its case rate calculation, arguing that SDSU is isolated from the community. But on Wednesday, Sept. 16, Gov. Gavin Newsom disagreed, saying a university campus is not separate from the larger community.
 In light of San Diego County’s approach toward the purple tier, La Mesa-Spring Valley, a school district of about 12,000 students, announced this week it will postpone in-person schooling to the end of November because of San Diego County’s worsening case rate.
 The district announced to parents Tuesday, Sept. 15, that it would postpone reopening from its original planned date of the week of Oct. 12 to the week of Nov. 30.
 “SDSU is very much our community — many SDSU students work in our schools — and the newly reported outbreak has caused a heightened sense of fear for many of our staff members and families,” Superintendent David Feliciano said in an email.
 “The reports that the county will likely go purple has greatly increased concerns over the prospect of schools reopening in less than a month.”
 SDSU students work at La Mesa-Spring Valley as student teachers, aides and attendants in the district’s child care program.
 Feliciano said regardless of which tier the county is in, the newly reported case rates in the community were concerning enough for the district to postpone reopening.
 “The last thing we want to do is reopen and then turn around and have to close again,” Feliciano said.
 La Mesa-Spring Valley officials said they have been wary that the state might keep schools from reopening if the county falls to the purple tier.
 Feliciano said it doesn’t make sense that schools are forced to stay closed in other purple counties but not in counties that go from red to purple.
 “Why is it considered safe here, but not there? It’s all very confusing,” he said. “We would rather err on the side of caution.”
 Some health experts at UC San Diego have similarly argued that schools shouldn’t reopen if their county reverts to the poorer COVID-19 conditions that previously kept them from reopening.
