Questions regarding the nature of the powers to participate in criminality are particularly significant as the majority ruling notably avoided any analysis of whether or not action which potentially breaches ECHR rights was authorised by the policy. This is aside from stating that there was ‘nothing inherent’ in the policy which creates a ‘significant risk’ of a breach of article 3 [100]. In avoiding ruling on such matters the majority stated that a ‘fundamental difficulty’ is that the ‘question of whether there has been a breach of a Convention right is usually one to be determined after the event on the concrete facts of a particular case rather than in the abstract’ [101]. It is not clear what this means in light of the IPT presumably having examined evidence pertaining to the application of the policy in practice in closed proceedings. Ultimately the Tribunal ruled that the parties to the case did not have standing to determine the breach of Convention rights [107]. Again the reasoning for this is not entirely clear given that parties to the case included the Pat Finucane Centre which represents families affected by the conflict in Northern Ireland and therefore potentially at risk of having been directly affected by the Government’s policy (‘potentially at risk’ of ECHR violations is the basis for standing in relation to surveillance cases considered by the IPT in the case of _Human Rights Watch and ors v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Office and ors_ _._ ).

While no one would disagree that courts make determinative assessments of law, the idea that the function of oversight bodies does not include making assessments regarding the lawfulness of activities of the Security Service is not consistent with the image often presented of the role of oversight by the UK Government, as well as by the IPT itself. Indeed in requesting that Parliament pass RIPA, the UK Government (in the form of Jack Straw, Home Secretary at the time) expressly stated that the role of the commissioners would be to ‘reassure Parliament and the public’ that investigatory powers used by the Security Service and law enforcement ‘are being used properly’ (see para 777), and former judges are required to be appointed in both bodies to make such assessments (see RIPA, s59 (5), now repealed, and s227 (2) of the IPA).  Conclusions on the lawfulness of Security Service activities by the ISC and IPCO have also been quoted by the IPT. This includes when reasoning that the Government’s powers are lawful, precisely by virtue of these bodies existing to determine ‘compliance’ of the security services with their ‘obligations’, which must include their legal ones - thus satisfying ECHR requirements that sufficient safeguards exist to ensure such powers are not subject to abuse. This was a key factor in the IPT finding that hacking powers were lawful in _Privacy and Greennet_ __  [77]. In light of this, the majority’s commentary on the ISC and IPCO exposes a lack of coherence in the system of national security oversight.
