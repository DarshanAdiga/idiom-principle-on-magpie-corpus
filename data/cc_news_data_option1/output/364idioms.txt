 Mens Netanyahu er i Washington, skulle den israelske nasjonalforsamlingen Knesset etter planen møtes tirsdag ettermiddag for å diskutere anmodningen.
 Statsministeren skriver på Facebook samme dag at han trekker forespørselen om immunitet fra straffeforfølgelse, melder avisa Haaretz.
 – Jeg vil ikke tillate at mine politiske motstandere bruker denne saken for å splitte denne historiske bevegelsen jeg leder, sier Netanyahu, som viser til den såkalte fredsplanen som USAs president Donald Trump ventes å legge fram tirsdag.
 Etter langvarig etterforskning kunngjorde den israelske riksadvokaten i november at det var tatt ut tiltale mot Netanyahu for flere tilfeller av bestikkelser, svindel og tillitsbrudd.
 ## Være eller ikke være?
 70-åringen er den første sittende statsministeren i Israels historie som blir tiltalt i en straffesak. Statsministeren avviser anklagene og har sagt at han ønsker å lede Israel videre i mange år framover.
 Når han nå trekker begjæringen, baner det vei for at den rettslige prosessen mot Netanyahu kan fortsette.
 For Netanyahu kan Trumps plan bli et politisk være eller ikke være, ettersom han 2. mars går til valg for tredje gang på ett år.

Through the power of television, I felt like I knew Kobe Bryant on a first- name basis for more than half his life.
   
 I remember seeing the Charlotte Hornets draft the 18-year-old prodigy out of high school, and watched them foolishly trade Kobe to the Los Angeles Lakers, where he would play for 20 years, make 18 All-Star teams and win five NBA championships.
   
 I saw Kobe's debut for the Lakers on Nov. 3, 1996 against the Minnesota Timberwolves. He played only six minutes, went 0 for 1 from the floor and had one rebound and blocked shot.
   
 Kobe went on to become one of the greatest basketball players of all time. He was the NBA's third all-time leading scorer until LeBron James passed him Saturday night.
   
 I watched every second of his 81-point performance against the Toronto Raptors in 2006. It was the second-most points ever scored in an NBA game, only behind Wilt Chamberlain's ungodly 100.
   
 I recall watching Kobe's final game on April 13, 2016, when he scored 60 points against the Utah Jazz in a performance that ranks among his most phenomenal. He was 37 when he did it.
   
 Then Sunday, just after noon, I received an urgent phone call from my son, who told me the news.
   
 "You're not going to believe it, But Kobe Bryant died this morning in a helicopter crash," he said.
   
 I thought it was one of those internet hoaxes. You know, the real fake news.
   
 "No, it's on everywhere. CNN. ESPN. Turn on the TV," he urged me.
   
 My heart raced as I went to the medium that introduced me to Kobe Bryant and where I fell in love with the Black Mamba.
   
 The TV images confirmed it. A helicopter crashed in Calabasas, California, just outside Los Angeles, around 9:47 a.m. At least five people were dead (later revealed to be nine people killed), including Bryant and his 13-year- old daughter.
   
 OMG. No! I thought to myself it wasn't possible. I was in a bad dream.
   
 This was one of the most popular and beloved sports figures in the world. He wasn't as incredible as Michael Jordan on the basketball court, but the 6-foot-6 guard was close. It was like when I heard Muhammad Ali had died, except Ali was far past his prime when he passed away.
   
 Kobe was one of the few players who inspired me to buy NBA tickets. When my late son, Blake, was a student at Arizona State University, he lived right down the street from the Phoenix Suns' arena. We went to see Kobe and the Lakers play against the Suns twice in the twilight of his career, in 2015 and 2016.
   
 What made Bryant different than the rest? Maybe it was he went straight to the NBA without playing in college, the first guard ever drafted out of high school. Maybe it's because I wrote about his father, Joe "Jellybean" Bryant, late in his career and early in mine as a sports journalist.
   
 I liked Kobe's work ethic and his will to win. He did not like excuses. Kobe teamed with 7-foot-1, 325-pound Shaq O'Neal to form one of the best one-two punch in NBA history. Their sometimes-explosive partnership led the Lakers to three straight titles from 2000-2002.
   
 The sheer exhilaration of Kobe's smile and expressions after he won NBA titles were electric enough to light all of Southern California. There were no power shortages when Kobe was in the Staples Center.
   
 In life, sports megastars played an oversized role. Kobe Bryant was no Dr. Jonas Salk, who discovered a vaccine for polio. He was no saint like Mother Teresa, who soothed orphans and impoverished as a nun and missionary. He was no Ali, who was stripped of his heavyweight boxing championship for protesting the Vietnam War. He was no Winston Churchill or Franklin D. Roosevelt, who were determined to defeat the Nazis.
   
 Watching Bryant grow up and develop into an all star, though, was as satisfying as seeing the Krispy Kreme doughnut sign turn red and read, "Hot Now." The sound of his three-pointers swishing through the hoop, or his slam dunks rattling the basket, were as soothing to me as the feel of a cool mountain stream on a humid afternoon.
   
 I was born in Los Angeles but was raised in Tennessee, you see. My father was working in the missile industry near Santa Monica, California, during the Cuban Missile Crisis at the time. My mother was from Detroit, so my sports loyalties alternated between LA (Lakers in basketball) and the Motor City (Tigers in baseball).
   
 The Lakers were a sports gold standard most of my life. Chamberlain, Jerry West and Elgin Baylor gave way to other legends such as Kareen Abdul-Jabbar and Magic Johnson in the 1970s and 1980s.
   
 As I watched thousands gather outside the Staples Center in Los Angeles on Sunday night, I could feel their pain from 1,994 miles away. If it were less than a 29-hour drive across Interstate 40 to LA, I could see myself among them.
   
 I'm going to be mesmerized and emotional -- like almost all of you -- when the Lakers play the Los Angeles Clippers on Tuesday night in their next game. How can the new Lakers, including LeBron, go on? Easy. Kobe would have wanted no excuses. He would have wanted them to be cold blooded as a Black Mamba, the fictional agile, aggressive assassin from movie director Quentin Tarantino's "Kill Bill" as portrayed by actress Uma Thurman.
   
 TV and pop culture brought Kobe into our living rooms for 20 seasons with the Lakers. He pressed on through injuries and past his prime. He certainly was great entertainment. "The greatest Laker of all time all is gone," as Magic Johnson tweeted Sunday.
   
 It's true. Kobe is gone, but he will not be easily forgotten. Sadly, there will be a Pacific Oceans of tears to come from his family, friends and fans.
   
 We knew him well.

SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- With a fearsome front four capable of pressuring quarterbacks without blitzes, a lockdown cornerback in Richard Sherman and the speed at linebacker and safety to limit big plays, the San Francisco 49ers had the league's stingiest pass defense in a decade.
   
 Shutting down Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs' passing game in the Super Bowl will be a far tougher challenge than anything the Niners have faced this season.
   
 "His mobility is unique. His arm strength is ridiculous. He's very, very accurate," defensive coordinator Robert Saleh said. "But what I don't think people give him enough credit for is that he actually plays quarterback. There's a lot of people, there's a lot of quarterbacks in this league that will say no to number one and then it just becomes street ball. He gets rid of the ball on time. He puts it where it needs to be. He hits a lot of throws in rhythm. And when he needs to take his shot, he knows how to buy time in the pocket and do it. So he's a superstar in every way you can possibly imagine and he's going to be tough to deal with."
   
 The 49ers had to deal with Mahomes already in his brief but brilliant career. Back in Week 3 of the 2018 season in Mahomes' first year as starter in Kansas City, he threw for 314 yards and three TDs and led touchdown drives on all five possessions in the first half of the Chiefs' 38-27 win.
   
 That marked the only time in the past 20 seasons that the Niners allowed five straight TD drives to open a game. They had no answer for Mahomes' play-making ability.
   
 In the rematch next Sunday in the Super Bowl in Miami, San Francisco should be better equipped at least to try to slow Mahomes down.
   
 It added a dynamic edge rushing duo in the offseason, acquiring Dee Ford in a trade with the Chiefs and drafting Nick Bosa second overall. That led to the team allowing the fewest yards in a season since the 2009 New York Jets.
   
 "When you have edge rushers it speeds up the process of the quarterback, and, not that he needs speeding up, he already gets rid of it pretty quick. But it changes the game," Saleh said. "It unlocks the offensive line so it creates a little bit more space and it gives the guys inside more space to operate. So having those guys out there, having them at full speed, will do nothing but help."
   
 Bosa and Ford transformed the entire defense as the added pressure helped San Francisco create more turnovers after having a record-low seven takeaways in 2018.
   
 The Niners have 57 sacks including the playoffs, with Ford, Bosa, Arik Armstead and DeForest Buckner all recording at least 7 1/2, making it difficult for offenses to key on one spot.
   
 "If we're covering and that guy takes two or three hitches most likely he'll be laying on his back," safety Jimmie Ward said. "But Patrick Mahomes is a mover in the pocket. I'm pretty sure he'll make some guys miss and he'll make some plays. We just have to make more plays than he does."
   
 San Francisco got a league-best 40 of those sacks without bringing in extra pass rushers, which will be especially important against Mahomes, who has 22 TD passes, zero interceptions and a 118.3 passer rating in his career when defenses rush five or more players.
   
 But not getting pressure with four creates its own problems, giving Mahomes the extra times he needs to generate big plays downfield to speedsters like Tyreek Hill, Mecole Hardman and Sammy Watkins.
   
 Mahomes leads the NFL with 76 completions the past two seasons on throws at least 20 yards downfield, an aspect San Francisco's defense is designed to stop.
   
 It allowed the second fewest deep completions in the regular season, with only eight on 48 attempts, thanks in large part to Sherman's coverage skills and Ward's ability as a free safety to cover ground deep downfield.
   
 "We believe in each other," Sherman said. "We believe in the scheme. We believe in what we've done all year, and we plan on going out there and putting a good product on tape and seeing how it goes."
   
 When San Francisco has struggled defensively this season it has often come against more mobile quarterbacks, with Kyler Murray, Russell Wilson and Lamar Jackson all having more success than QBs less apt to run like Aaron Rodgers and Kirk Cousins.
   
 That's just another reason why Mahomes is so tough. He has scrambled 10 times this postseason for 112 yards, taking advantage of undisciplined rush lanes and defensive backs who drop too deep into coverage.
   
 The quarterback who exploited that the most against the Niners this season was Wilson, who scrambled 12 times for 79 yards in two games, compared with just 20 scrambles for 82 yards against San Francisco in the other 16 games.
   
 "Every week, whether you're playing a guy like Mahomes or a statue, it doesn't matter," Saleh said. "You have to have respect for where he is in the pocket. And your pass rush has to tie in with one another so that way you're just not carelessly rushing the passer to where even a statue can buy time and escape the pocket and create an explosive play through an off-schedule play. But that goes every single week."

 Pompeo ended his scathing letter with, "It is worth noting that Bangladesh is NOT Ukraine." It's not clear if that was a typo and Pompeo meant another country, or if he was suggesting Kelly pointed to Bangladesh on the map.

SCOTTSBORO, Alabama -- At least eight people were killed early Monday in an explosive fire that consumed dozens of vessels docked at a marina along the Tennessee River in northern Alabama.
   
 Scottsboro Fire Chief Gene Necklaus said all eight people who were known to be missing have been confirmed dead, and "that number could go up, because we don't know how many were on boats" that sank.
   
 The fire began just after midnight at Jackson County Park Marina and quickly consumed the dock as people were sleeping. The wooden dock at at least 35 vessels went up in flames and an aluminum roof that covered many of the boats melted and collapsed, cutting off escape routes and raining debris over the area as boaters leaped into the river.
   
 "It was scary. The worst thing for me is you could hear people screaming for help, and there was nothing we could do. Nobody could do anything to get to them," said Julie Jackson, who lives with her husband and son in a houseboat on another dock that did not burn at the marina.
   
 At least seven people were sent to hospitals suffering from exposure to the flames or the frigid water.
   
 Necklaus said some of the burning boats sank at the dock and others floated away before going under. He said divers need to locate each one and search them individually before they can be sure there were no other victims.
   
 "We woke up hearing screams and popping noises," Mandy Durham, who was with her boyfriend in a nearby boat, told The Associated Press. "When we woke up, we could see red through the window."
   
 "Within 15 to 20 minutes, the whole dock was in flames," she added. "All these boats have propane tanks and gas tanks, and that's a lot of fire."
   
 The blaze destroyed the B dock, about 50 yards (46 meters) from the A dock where the boat of Durham's boyfriend was moored.
   
 "There were numerous people rescued from the water who had escaped by going into the water," Jackson County Chief Sheriff's Deputy Rocky Harnen told The Associated Press shortly after dawn. "We're trying to get divers down here to search for possible victims."
   
 People were jumping onto a boat at the end of the dock because fire had consumed the middle portion and that was their only escape. But then the flames spread to that boat, leaving water as their only way out, Durham said.
   
 "Water was the only place they had to go," Durham said. "Its just extremely sad. It's horrible."
   
 Georgia resident Michael Watson said his aunt lived with her husband and five children on one of the boats that burned. He said his aunt was confirmed among the dead and authorities are still looking for the other six family members. Officials have not released the names of any of those killed or missing.
   
 Reaching the victims proved challenging for rescue crews.
   
 "The damage from the dock has fallen on top of the boats, and some of the boats have drifted off," Harnen said.
   
 Hours after sunrise, smoke was still rising from the remains of a wooden dock, and pieces of metal that once formed the roof were partially submerged. Police and fire boats with flashing lights were positioned near the charred remains, and a yellow floating boom was being deployed around the marina to contain spilled fuel.
   
 Most of the boats that were destroyed had people living on them permanently, but some mainly spent weekends on them, Durham said. The park includes a boat ramp, a dock and a restaurant, and offers boat rentals, according to Jackson County's government website.
   
 "Everybody is just hoping to find the ones they knew on that dock. There were families there. It's devastating," Durham said.

Nach israelischen Medienberichten sieht Trumps Vorhaben unter anderem die Annektierung israelischer Siedlungen im Westjordanland sowie des Jordantals vor - dies würde bedeuten, dass Israel große Teile des Westjordanlands seinem Staatsgebiet einverleibt.

The council is the official student government representing undergraduate students at UCLA and manages about $9 million in student fees. The USAC Election Board is the body that manages all USAC elections and enforces the election code. The council amended the code on a number of sections, including contingencies for the resignation or removal of the election board, procedures for implementing physical polling stations and rules governing campaigning on the Hill.

When I was young I would tackle anything without a thought, care or preparation – including extreme weather. That earned me frostbite, aching joints and numerous lingering health conditions. I learned the hard way there is nothing wrong with being prepared and smart about cold-weather riding gear.
 When climbing out of bed on those frosty mornings, remember the key is to dress in layers. Try to wear front-buttoned or zippered items because they are much easier to peel off once warm. Avoid cheap slippery, shiny, noisy, bulky or billowy fabrics. GQ or Cosmopolitan magazine aren’t going to use a pen- checker picture on a winter cover.
 Start with good underwear like synthetic fabric or wool; it’s breathable, keeping perspiration and moisture away. Wear good breeches or jeans with a long-sleeved sweater. Insulated thermal riding pants are also a good choice. Slippery ski pants are not; a person wearing them will soon be hanging off the side of the horse.

 A little while back, the U. S. Postal Service bent a bit, and went against the grain of its own tradition to name the Hornell post office in honor of Lance Corporal Zachary Smith. Nineteen year-old Corporal Smith, First Battalion of the Sixth Marine Regiment, had been killed on January 24, 2010 while supporting combat operations in Afghanistan. He was the first Hornell combat death since Vietnam, and the post office now honors his name.
 Similarly, the stretch of Interstate Route 390 between Exit 2 (Cohocton) and Exit 3 (Wayland) is now the Sergeant Devin A. Snyder Memorial Highway. Sergeant Snyder, of the army's 793rd Military Police Battalion, was one of four soldiers killed with an improvised explosive device on June 4, 2011, also in Afghanistan. She was the first female soldier from western New York to die in the war.
 War memorials are scattered across our communities, but the very names on the map often form memorials as well. The state legislature often honored heroes of the Revolution with county names. George Washington, James Monroe, Nathaniel Greene and Alexander Hamilton all crossed the Delaware in 1776, on the attack that in some ways was the turning point of the Revolution. Herkimer (Oriskany), Warren (Bunker Hill), and Montgomery (Quebec) were all killed in that war.
 Schuyler, Steuben, Sullivan, Broome and Wayne were all generals in the War of Independence. Like Washington himself, Clinton, Israel Putnam, and van Cortlandt each served not just in the Revolutionary War, but also in the French and Indian War. (Van Cortlandt's name was anglicized a little to give us Cortland County, and the Cortland apple for that matter.)
 We can also see the experience of the Revolution if we zero in a little more closely on the map. The Dansvilles (Steuben and Livingston Counties) were named for Captain Dan Faulkner. Silas Wheeler and Robert Troup (Troupsburg) had each been P.O.W.s during the war. Colonel Arthur Lindsley got his name misspelled on the second line of his town's founding document, and it's been called Lindley ever since.
 The War of 1812 was not very inspiring, and as far as I know only inspired one local name, which isn't even on the map any more. Until the 1860s Franklin Street in Hornell was called Lundy's Lane, presumably after the fierce 1814 Battle of Lundy's Lane (Niagara Falls, Canada) in which local troops fought.
 Curiously enough the Mexican War, which was not very popular in the north and in which local troops did little more than garrison duty, inspired a number of local names. The Steuben County Town of Fremont was named for 'the Pathfinder,' John C. Fremont, a military man and western explorer who seized much of California when the war broke out. (In 1856 he was the first Republican candidate for president, and voters in his namesake town backed him enthusiastically.)
 The small settlements of Sonora (Steuben County) and Monterey (Schuyler) remember significant Mexican War locations, while Buena Vista (Town of Howard, Steuben) spotlights a major victory for future Whig president Zachary Taylor. Young Hickory in Troupsburg commemorates Mexican War president James K. Polk, a Democrat, thus putting all three major parties on the Steuben map with Mexican War references.
 After the massive World Wars, with gigantic death tolls, we were more likely to see general 'war memorial' edifices (Bath municipal building, Corning stadium, old Corning library), but individual fallen were still remembered in the names of Legion posts and V.F.W. posts. I suppose that not long after the Mexican War, our local maps were pretty well filled up. There wasn't much space for new names.

 As a pen checker there’s no option to skip the task because I don’t feel like being cold, or I’m not in the mood. If I tried that I wouldn’t be employed for long. Everyone’s likely heard the expression “tough as a cowboy” or “when life gets tough, cowboy up.” Those can be accurate quotations for cowboys or pen checkers in general.
 But here’s another to consider – “A cowboy’s life is tough; it’s even tougher if you’re careless.”

Chief Justice of the USA Judicial Board Jamail Gibbs said he made two main recommendations to the election code changes. The first was to remove the outdated rules and regulations link on the election board webpage. Gibbs, a fourth-year political science student, said the second and more important recommendation was to prohibit campaigning on the Hill without exception.

Gibbs also said he recommended changes to clarify how the transfer of powers during elections takes place. Previously, election results became effective following the council's approval of minutes reading the results. These changes now make all election results official by a two-step process in which the election board would certify the results and the judicial board would swear in the officer-elect.

Dear Dave,
 We're debt-free except for our home, and we'll have our fully-funded emergency fund of three to six months of expenses, we've agreed on six months' worth, saved up by the end of February. We're also setting aside a little each month to buy a newer car with cash later. We're about $5,000 from our car fund goal, but my husband is getting impatient. He wants us to go ahead and finance the remainder since it's a relatively small amount. He has tried to justify this by mentioning that you don't seem to have a problem with people borrowing money to buy a house. Could you explain the difference?
 Lana
 Dear Lana,
 Okay, first things first. I don't like debt of any kind. I don't really like borrowing for a house, but I'm not unreasonable. I tolerate mortgage loans, as long as people use a 15-year, fixed-rate mortgage, with payments that are no more than a fourth of their monthly take-home pay. A house is often the largest purchase in a person's life, and one most people can't achieve based solely on saving. I still recommend, however, setting aside as much as possible for a down payment before taking out a mortgage.
 Here's the thing. Cars go down in value, while traditional homes generally increase in value substantially over the years. Plus, you can get a great, pre-owned car for $10,000 to $15,000. This is an amount which, in my mind, is doable over the course of several months through determined saving and living on a budget. Depending on where you live, a good home can cost 10 to 20 times that much.
 The best way to build wealth and have a secure financial life is to stay away from debt. This means getting out of mortgage debt as quickly as possible, too. You're never going to win with money if you can't learn to delay pleasure.
 Everyone has that little kid inside them, and that little kid wants everything he or she wants right now. Your husband is asking a normal question, but he's dangerously close to letting that immature little kid out. It happens to all of us once in a while, but we have to grow to a point as adults where we tell that little kid no!

Minnesota's Andrew Wiggins took the ball and placed it on the free throw line upon the very spot Bryant sank two free throws on December 14, 2014, to move past Michael Jordan and become the NBA's number three all-time scorer.
 Bryant kept that spot on the NBA career points list until just hours before his death, when he was passed by current Lakers superstar LeBron James.
 Sacramento defeated Minnesota 133-129 in overtime, but just as in host Chicago's 110-109 win over San Antonio, heartache over Bryant's death tempered the joy of victory.
 "There will never be another Kobe Bryant," Chicago's Zach LaVine said. "There's only one person like that ever. He made an impact on people off the court and in basketball as well.
 "Kids growing up in the 1980s, they wanted to be like Mike (Jordan). We all wanted to be like Kobe."
 Dallas won 107-97 at Oklahoma City with the host Thunder playing without forward Chris Paul. He missed his first game of the season mourning the death of Bryant, his friend and teammate on the 2008 and 2012 US Olympic gold medal squads.
 At Salt Lake City, the Houston Rockets had a career-high 50 points from 12th- year veteran Eric Gordon in a 126-117 victory over Utah. But he was still struggling to wrap his thoughts around Bryant's death.
 "I'm still hurting for that," Gordon said. "I've known him since I was in college. It's a tough day for everybody."
 The Rockets were without NBA scoring leader James Harden, out with a thigh bruise, and Russell Westbrook, taking a planned rest game. Gordon led the Rockets in beating a Jazz club that had won 14 of 15 prior starts and nine in a row at home.
 Utah fans applauded the game-opening Bryant tribute, one waving a sign saying, "Salt Lakers feel it too."
 "He touched so many people, truly a unique human being," said Jazz coach Quin Snyder, a Lakers assistant coach guiding Bryant in the 2011-12 season.
