Jim Alexander is an Inland Empire native who started with his hometown newspaper, The Press-Enterprise, longer ago than he cares to admit. He's been a sports columnist off and on since 1992, and a full-time columnist since 2010. Yes, he's opinionated, but no, that's not the only club in his bag.

This one, which turned on Kedon Slovis' touchdown pass to Amon-Ra St. Brown with 16 seconds left and was definitively decided when Dorian Thompson-Robinson's final play Hail Mary pass was knocked to the turf in the end zone, should hang prominently in an already crowded gallery of great Trojan-Bruin finishes.
