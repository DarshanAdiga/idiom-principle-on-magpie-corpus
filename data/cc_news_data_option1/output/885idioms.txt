The CDC is relying on local health clinicians to determine testing needs. In addition to CDC test kits, commercial manufacturers overseen by the Food and Drug Administration are providing tests directly to states. These types of tests are typically what are on the front lines in the United States, Messonnier said.
 Vice President Mike Pence said Tuesday that 77 cases of coronavirus have been diagnosed in the U.S. That number excludes the 45 people who were passengers aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan and were repatriated to America, which brings the total to more than 120.
 Pence said that a task force will issue new guidance from the CDC to make it clear that any American can be tested for the virus and no restrictions subject to doctor's orders.
 Commercial laboratories are expected to have 2,500 test kits available to provide 1.5 million tests. And the Office of Management and Budget will direct all federal government agencies to review internal travel and adhere to State Department guidance.
 "The threat of the coronavirus to the American pubic remains low," Pence said.
 Pence also said that chief executives of all major airlines are expected to meet at the White House Wednesday to discuss contact tracing data for the coronavirus.
 The West Coast continues to bear the brunt of the illnesses in the U.S., with the focus on Northern California and Washington.
 At least five Northern California counties reported new cases of COVID-19 on Monday. On Tuesday, the city of Berkeley reported its first case after an individual visited a country with an outbreak. That individual has remained at home in a self-imposed quarantine since returning.
 "While the risk of infection remains low, the expanded presence of the virus in our community is a reality we should all prepare for," said Berkeley Health Officer Dr. Lisa Hernandez. "There are steps that all of us in the community can take now to improve basic hygiene and also prepare for a wider spread in the future."
 Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Tuesday that the California Department of Public Health received approval from the CDC and the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health to dip into its emergency planning reserves of 21 million N-95 face masks for medical workers on the front lines.
 Although the flurry of positive test results in recent days does signal that the virus is circulating within the U.S., experts advised the public to avoid reading too much into those numbers.
 Until late last week, federal officials were not allowing widespread testing for the virus, so many people who were already sick are only now being diagnosed, said Harvard epidemiology professor Marc Lipsitch.
 "Some of the numbers are changing because new things are happening, but a lot of the numbers are changing because we're discovering things that have already happened," Lipsitch said in a forum Monday hosted by Harvard's public health school. "It's really important to distinguish 'Oh, goodness, there's a new cluster' from 'Oh, goodness, we just discovered that there's a cluster that's been there for some time.’ ”
 As the virus spreads, officials are trying to push back against Asian American bias and misinformation surrounding the outbreak.
 Amid signs that some are staying away from Chinatowns and other Asian communities in the U.S., Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., sharply criticized the xenophobia that had been displayed toward ethnic communities.
 "We've also seen a rise in racism toward Asian Americans because the virus is associated with China," she said. "This is unconscionable, and it's not the American way. People of all ages, races and ethnicities are susceptible to this disease. Bigotry toward any one group for a virus they have nothing to do with makes no sense."
 Several areas in California have declared local emergencies amid the outbreak. Sonoma County on Monday issued a declaration after announcing two people had been diagnosed with the virus. One infected person returned from a cruise to Mexico 10 days ago and was hospitalized, but the case "is a cause for concern," said county health officer Dr. Celeste Philip.
 Declaring a state of emergency will allow the county to respond properly to the outbreak as well as "work in tandem with our cities and healthcare providers to ensure we are prepared to combat an outbreak of COVID-19 in our communities," Philip said in a statement.
 Meanwhile, more COVID-19 cases were reported in Santa Clara County, bringing its total to 11 — the most of any California county. The source of infection for the latest two cases, reported Tuesday, is still under investigation.
 Many initial reports of COVID-19 have been among healthcare workers, who are likely to encounter sick patients. Hundreds of healthcare workers in California have already been asked to stay home because of contact with patients diagnosed with the disease over the last few weeks.
 On Monday, Placer County reported a confirmed case of COVID-19 in a healthcare worker at NorthBay VacaValley Hospital in Vacaville, where a COVID-19 patient had been admitted. County spokeswoman Katie Combs Prichard said the medical worker, who lives in Placer County, came into contact with that patient and was likely infected by her.
 President Donald Trump said Tuesday during a speech to the National Association of Counties' legislative conference in Washington that he expected Congress would pass a special funding bill providing $8.5 billion — far more than he requested — to fight the spread of the illness in the United States.
 "It just shows you what can happen — six weeks ago, eight weeks ago, you never heard of this. All of a sudden, it's got the world aflutter," Trump said, noting later while leaving the White House to visit the National Institutes of Health that he is looking at further international travel restrictions involving Italy, Japan and South Korea, but will not limit domestic travel.

A convicted rapist from Massachusetts who was released from prison last month because he has terminal cancer is back behind bars after allegedly violating conditions of his parole, officials said. Benjamin LaGuer, sentenced to life in prison in 1984 after being convicted of raping his 59-year-old neighbor in Leominster the previous year, has long maintained his innocence and drawn the backing of several high-profile supporters. He was taken into custody on Tuesday, according to a spokesman for the state Executive Office of Public Safety. “Benjamin LaGuer was returned to custody today following violations of his conditions of release,” Jake Wark said in a statement. \"These violations continued despite warnings and other graduated sanctions. Parole revocation proceedings will be scheduled in the weeks to come.” The exact violation was not specified, but when he was released Feb. 5, the parole board applied some conditions on his release, including a curfew and electronic monitoring. LaGuer, 56, has terminal liver cancer, his lawyers have said in legal filings seeking compassionate release. The state's courts have repeatedly rejected LaGuer's appeals, including the state's highest court in 2007. He has been denied parole several previous times.

 “When I was younger, I witnessed by brother’s team win the section championship and ever since then I have wanted to accomplish the same thing. Also, at the end of the day, I feel that our record wouldn’t have meant anything if we didn’t win it,” said Hernandez
 The senior, who led the Northern Section in goals scored this season tallying 42, without question got his most important in Saturday’s contest.
 However, the RedHawks still needed to control the Spartans for the remainder of the match and did just that with another impressive effort by the defense.
 Goalkeeper Diego Avila, although unchallenged in the first half earned the shutout by keeping a clean sheet over the final 40 minutes despite increased pressure by the Spartans and was aided considerably by the outstanding play of defenders Jesus Hernandez, Andy Lopez, Darien Sarabia and Nico Lopez.
 Midfielders Edgar Garcia, Ulises Galvan, Rodrigo Rodriguez and Dominic Garcia along with forward Alejandro Rico also played an important role in moving the ball out of harm’s way and into the Spartan side of the field.

This disparity between the parliamentary party and the wider membership can barely be found in the 2020 leadership contest. The threshold of MP/MEP nominations needed has been lowered to 10%, but all three candidates still in the running gained more than required – and theirs were genuine supporters. Rebecca Long-Bailey benefited from a boosted left flank in the parliamentary Labour party. (While the election was a disaster, it brought 26 new Labour MPs due to resignations and defections. Nearly all are on the party’s left.) As a result, her parliamentary support was in keeping with her local party numbers. And on this measure, Keir Starmer excelled, winning by far the most nominations in both categories.

JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) - The Michael Bloomberg Presidential Campaign has offices in three locations in Mississippi.They are located in Jackson, on the Gulf Coast and in Oxford. Teresa Jones is the Mississippi Political Director for the Bloomberg Campaign.The Michael Bloomberg campaign explains Mississippi is important in the election of the next President.Jones tells us why Mississippi has been so important to Bloomberg and his campaign for president.Teresa Jones said, “Mississippi is important because we have forty-one delegates. That’s more than New Hampshire and we don’t want to leave any delegate on the table when it comes to winning the presidency. So, our campaign has been focused on playing in states that national Democrats have let go traditionally unchallenged by Donald Trump and Mississippi is one of those states.”Jones says Bloomberg is passionate about building generational wealth for African Americans throughout the nation.Bloomberg has spent more money than any of the other candidates in Mississippi. Jones says this state will continue to be a focus for their campaign.Jones said, “Seventy-percent of the Democratic primary is African-American. So that means the road through the primary in the states go through the black community. Mike Bloomberg is passionate about building generational wealth for African-Americans across this state and Mississippi is important in that, so that’s one of the reasons why I’m on the campaign and why we’re focusing on winning the delegates here in the state.”Teresa Jones says 70 percent of the Democratic Primary is African American. She says the campaign is focusing on winning delegates in this state.Most recently Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg dropped out of the race but they endorsed Joe Biden. What does that mean for the Bloomberg campaign?Jones said, “I’m not sure that’s going to be a huge concern for us. Right now we’re focused on getting out the vote and getting people to see that he is the only candidate who has invested in a full staff in our state, he is the only candidate who has been courting our voters for the past couple of months.”Super Tuesday was the first ballot test for Michael Bloomberg.Copyright 2020 WLBT.

Springfree trampolines are a new twist on the classic trampoline design. Instead of using metal coils that go all the way around the trampoline, Springfree trampolines don't use any springs whatsoever. Instead, the company uses a unique, revolutionary design that has flexible rods that are much safer.
 Another included safety feature you're getting with a Springfree Trampoline is that its frame is entirely hidden below the jumping surface…meaning it's impossible for your kids to fall on and hurt themselves.
 The netting around the trampoline also gets a safety upgrade with FlexiNet, which prevents falls to the ground and keeps jumpers on the jumping surface.
 Plus, Springfree Trampolines have won all sorts of awards. That has to be a good thing, right?

Mesa entrepreneur JW Jennings patented a way to collect and transfer desalination, that is mineral free, water in order to deliver the clean water to communities and entire countries.
 But Jennings claims red tape involving the federal government in one project and state government for a project involving Arizona has stymied him from putting his design to work.
 Moreover, he said, the U.S. Department of Energy has even enabled another company to implement his design without paying him a nickel.
 Jennings is the CEO of Green Star, an energy and water company based in Chandler.
 He came up with the design for a self-powered water-filtration system producing clean energy two years ago.
 Then last December, the U.S. Department of Energy awarded a $100 million- dollar grant to the National Alliance for Water Innovation for research and development on how to make a prototype for Jenning’s project – just six months after Jennings presented his designs to Puerto Rico, which needs to replace its hurricane-ravaged system for providing drinking water.
 “How could they put out a grant on my patent-protected system?” an exasperated Jennings wondered.
 The Energy Department grant was awarded to the National Alliance for Water Innovation three months after federal officials called for innovative ways to alleviate the “major humanitarian and economic challenge” caused by the depleting Colorado Basin system and other freshwater sources.
 U.S. Secretary of Energy, Rick Perry called desalination a “transformational” way to reinforce the nation’s water security.
 Jennings said his desalination process is “gravity-fed” and basically as long as the world keeps spinning on its axis, water will keep flowing into the filters.
 Because the majority of the construction is deep underwater, the offshore filtration system is also hurricane-proof, he said.
 He said the plant could process 200 million gallons of water a day to produce 100 million drinkable gallons in that time.
 In addition to offering a sustainable solution to the world’s clean water crisis, the plant would double as a clean energy producer, similar to the Hoover Dam,
 As water flows through the intake pipes, it would spin turbines linked to a power generator. Because the system can run off the hydro-electric power it initially creates, there is little fear of blackouts or brownouts to the supply.
 He said animal and plant life would be protected from harm in the process through a series of filters and guards that prevent even microscopic organisms from getting into the plant.
 Massive pipes will be equipped with filters that “for the majority, nothing can get through,” he said, adding the filters require 50 percent less power to push water through than any other desalination plant currently in operation.
 Jennings celebrated his recent accomplishment of being awarded both U.S. and international patents for the innovative design.
 Green Star has been in business for seven years, but “for the past two years, I’ve been working on patenting the concept. I finally got approval this January 2020.”
 Jennings says he came up with his idea for the “desal” plant from things he’d seen in his dreams.
 “I’d wake up over the course of six months and write down everything I could remember,” he said, adding powerful images and clear instructions for something he’d never seen before convinced him to begin exploring their meaning.
 “I’d look at my notebook with all these drawings and wordings I could hardly decipher,” he said.
 “What I did was type it all out and found it to be an entire system creating clean energy and clean water all at the same time.”
 Seeing the potential in this project to change the world, he needed someone to help him translate the conceptual plans into a working prototype.
 When asked if he brought the discoveries to an engineer initially, Jennings said he took his idea straight to Puerto Rico instead, proposing to build the plant in collaboration with Governor Wanda Váquez Garced and the local power and water authorities.
 According to January 2020 e-mails between Jennings and Garced’s office, the Puerto Rico governor thanked him profusely for wanting to help the island and offered steps to continue working together on his plan to construct a working plant along the U.S. territory’s coast.
 Jennings found another opportunity last summer to construct a working model of the desalination plant in West Africa.
 He prepared a presentation on how much water the innovation could provide to the country of Senegal.
 “The next thing I knew,” Jennings said, “I had the president of Senegal requesting my presence.”
 Senegal President Macky Sall invited Jennings to visit so he and a team of engineers and scientists could evaluate the project’s viability.
 “They loved the concept,” he said.
 Then Sall learned the majority lender on the product would be the International Monetary Fund.
 Sall didn’t like this idea even though by this time Jennings had been working with the Senegalese government for 30 days and even participated in a groundbreaking ceremony.
 To overcome Sall’s reluctance, Jennings said he proposed a way for the country to earn enough money to pay back the loan over 20 years.
 “The system could generate approximately 50-200 million U.S. dollars per year in revenue from [excess] power and water distribution,” if Senegal could sell it to neighboring countries.
 With an increase of water and power, the economy would be more able to support new businesses, invite more tourists, provide more jobs for residents and improve overall health of the land and its people, Jennings said.
 “Long story short, they didn’t want to do it,” Jennings said/
 Jennings is making further arrangements to install a working filtration system in Los Angeles, California, and in Rocky Point, Mexico.
 “I’ve been working with the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power,” he said. “They’ve got their engineers and scientists working on it.”
 Even closer to home, Arizona is facing near depletion of its water resources.
 “Phoenix is past the scarcity level of the water table,” remarked Jennings, citing the local government’s strategic contingency plan called “Minute 323” – which effectively cuts off Arizona’s water shares to Mexico to prevent adverse effects on the state’s water supply.
 Mexico had been on an emergency water ration since 2017, as Minute 319 provided for in an amendment to the 1944 Water Treaty between it and Arizona.
 The Colorado and Rio Grande rivers are still flowing to Mexico’s Sonoran area, but there are other users along their paths.
 By the time water reaches Mexico, it’s “just a trickle,” Jennings said.
 Jennings met with the Ernesto Munro, the president municipal, or mayor, of Puerto Peñasco to present his solution as an urgent addition to the waters of the Colorado Basin.
 “I told Munro, I’d like to create a second, separate plant [in Rocky Point] to pump water back into Arizona,” said Jennings, pointing out his plan would benefit everyone.
 But Jennings again encountered red tape when he took his project to Sonora Gov. Claudia Pavlovich and Gov. Doug Ducey.
 “They said I can’t simply cross an international border with the pipes,” Jenning said, and “it would take five to 10 years to create a treaty to negotiate this.”
 A workaround Jennings proposed was to run the piping through the desert of the Tohono O’odham Nation and allow the water distribution to be managed from the reservation.
 There is a virtually empty reservoir on the reservation that hold the water.
 From there, “the rest would go into Phoenix,” Jennings said, calling tribal leaders and Munro “completely amenable” to the plan.
 The excess water shared throughout Arizona would no longer be considered from Mexico but from within U.S. lands.
 The attempt to aid the Southwest’s impending drought was left unsettled, possibly because of the funding Arizona already dedicated to greywater management.
 Unless funds are rerouted, or Jennings can find a major investor to help him build a working prototype without political roadblocks, the green energy founder and inventor will be leveraging everything he has to protect his patent and see his dream come true.
 According to U.S. patent law, Jennings has up to one year from the time he revealed his design intentions to acquire the patent and still legally retain all ownership.

Avila, who at young age watched his older brother Christian play for Colusa, made six saves in the title match and credited the defense in front of him while also describing the significance of this win.
 “We have the best defense in the league and my defenders always step up in big games. Our coach pushed us hard so we could win, and this means everything to me,” Avila said.
 On the season Avila registered 87 saves and 11 shutouts.
 The RedHawks, who beat Rio Vista to win their first title back in 2004, and Esparto in 2016 for the second, have turned in one of the best seasons in the team’s history and according to Kiely its not hard to see why.
 “There are so many highly skilled players on this team and each player has a deep passion for the game of soccer, both of which are key for our team. One of the bigger reasons for our success however is they truly understand what teamwork is all about and they are unselfish. Each player does whatever it takes to help his team succeed both on and off the field,” said Kiely, who in addition to winning the section title just recently received notice that he will be inducted into the CYSA Hall of Fame in Pleasanton on March 14.
 Both the win and honor are a fitting reward for a coach who continues to inspire new generations to play soccer, the sport he loves.
 To get to the championship match the RedHawks had to get through last Tuesday’s semifinal against No. 4 Williams, the only team to have beaten Colusa so far this season.
 However, a Hernandez hat trick and a late, long range goal by Galvan was more than enough to secure the 4-0 shutout victory.
 Colusa (22-1-2) began play in the 2020 CIF Northern California Regional Tournament on March 3 at the California Soccer Park in Redding as the No. 7 seed when it squared off against No. 2 Anderson, a team it defeated 1-0 in a non-conference match back in January.

Ayushmann teams up opposite debutant Jitendra Kumar to portray on-screen lovers. Gajraj Rao and Neena Gupta also feature in the cast. "I feel happy that my parents and close relatives are proud of me and life decisions. It motivates me to move forward and push the envelope as an artist more. Their opinions matter the most to me and I'm delighted that they have loved my work in 'Shubh Mangal Zyada Savdhan'," Ayushmann added.

All of the best qualities of the potato come together in the batata vada, a glorious ball of wondrous textures and flavors. Coming up with an English name that does justice to describe batata vadas is a futile exercise. I think describing what it actually is makes more sense. First you must boil potatoes to soften the starch granules so you can mash them. Then, add herbs and the seasonings, and finally, the potato mixture is divided and shaped into balls that you dip into a thick chickpea flour batter before frying them in a small pot of oil. The golden brown batata vadas are then ready to serve with the chutney.

My Day 3 postpartum reality: It is unbelievable, unconditional love. It is an incredibly powerful bond that Dove and I share. It is tears of joy watching Edwin light up when he's with her. It is bursting with pride watching my older kids gently, lovingly & eagerly jump into their new found big sibling roles. It is very little sleep because, let's be real, is "sleep when the baby is sleeping" actually a thing? It is knowing that feeling delirious will be the new norm for a while. It is humbling, to say the least - switching from the mesh "mom diaper" with ice from the hospital to high waisted compression panties at home. It is drinking way too much prune juice with crushed ice because you are anxiously awaiting the first post-baby 💩. It is embracing and loving this body of mine. It is lots of laughs when Cruz asks why my stomach hasn't deflated. It is a flood of emotions when multiple lactation specialists tell you that only your right breast is able to breast feed the baby due to scarring on the left. It is trying to calm your mind when you are continuously running all the hypotheticals of every scenario in your head. It is a constant reminder to live in the moment and feel all the highs and lows that a new baby brings. It is the simultaneous notion of wanting to slow down while still feeling the need to rearrange and organize the entire house. It is doing your best to not compare your journey to anyone else's. It is overwhelming gratitude for each friend and family member who shows up without judgement, only to bring you love & food. It is a constant roller coaster & I wouldn't change it for the world. My baby girl is here and I love her more than words can say. We each have our own journey and this is mine 💕🕊 #postpartum #inlovewithdove

Amazon and other big companies are trying to keep their employees healthy by banning business trips, but they've dealt a gut punch to a travel industry already reeling from the virus outbreak. The Seattle-based online retail giant has told its nearly 800,000 workers to postpone any non-essential travel within the United States or around the globe. Swiss food giant Nestle told its 291,000 employees worldwide to limit domestic business travel and halt international travel until March 15. French cosmetics maker L’Oréal, which employs 86,000 people, issued a similar ban until March 31. Other companies, like Twitter, are telling their employees worldwide to work from home. Google gave that directive to its staff of 8,000 at its European headquarters in Dublin on Tuesday. Major business gatherings, like the Geneva International Motor Show and the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, have also been canceled. On Tuesday, Facebook confirmed it will no longer attend the South by Southwest conference in Austin, Texas, which is scheduled to begin March 13.

The wet and bloody demise of Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) in a shower at the Bates Motel remains a shockingly effective jaw-dropper thanks to Alfred Hitchcock's precision cuts, Bernard Herrmann's shrieking score and lots of red in black and white. But it also remains jarring because Marion, introduced as if she were to be the final girl (as she'd be called today), is killed off about a third of the way through the film. It's a narrative gotcha that was almost unheard-of in cinema of the time, especially for an actress as celebrated as Leigh. A surprise death early in a story is a plot jolt that still startles, whether it's for Drew Barrymore's character in "Scream" or for an entire wedding party in "Game of Thrones."

When Corbyn ran for the top job in 2015, he needed 15% of the parliamentary party to back him to secure a place on the ballot paper. The veteran leftwing MP did scrape through this initial stage of the race, but did not do so with that level of genuine support. He instead relied on colleagues – later called “morons” – casting “strategic” nominations, which incidentally turned out not to have any strategy behind them. Almost half of his 35 nominations came from Labour MPs who did not actually want him to win, in a bid to broaden the debate. And yet he was endorsed by 152 local parties, substantially more than any of the other three contenders, and swept to victory in the final vote.

Reality is treated to a bombshell moment in one dramatically meta scene from Michael Haneke's deeply disturbing home invasion film. It occurs later in the story when a woman being held captive in her home by two men shoots one of them. The man's co-conspirator then fixes the mishap in their plan by using a remote control to rewind the movie itself, as if it were in a VCR. It then plays again, with the scene (and history) rewritten as if the shooting never occurred. It's a visually and narratively disruptive moment that unsparingly reminds the viewer that evil calls the shots in this film, and that revenge and justice will ultimately have no place in it.
