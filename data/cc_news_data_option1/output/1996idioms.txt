A few showers will move through the area this morning but expect those to be fairly light and spotty. On and off rain is likely during the rest of the day but I want to stress that it will not be all day rain. In between bouts of rain we'll get a chance to reach the lower 70s with a few pockets of sunshine even possible. A few more storms are likely this evening and along with showers we'll have lingering rain into the overnight hours. It will all be gone by the time you wake up Saturday.

YPSILANTI TOWNSHIP, Mich. — Pandemic politics shadowed President Donald Trump's trip to Michigan on Thursday as he highlighted lifesaving medical devices, with the president and officials from the electoral battleground state clashing over federal aid, mail-in ballots and face masks.


  Trump visited Ypsilanti, outside Detroit, to tour a Ford Motor Co. factory that had been repurposed to manufacture ventilators, the medical breathing machines governors begged for during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.


  But his visit came amid a long-running feud with the state's Democratic governor and a day after the president threatened to withhold federal funds over the state's expanded vote-by-mail effort. And, again, the president did not publicly wear a face covering despite a warning from the state's top law enforcement officer that a refusal to do so might lead to a ban on his return.


  All of the Ford executives giving Trump the tour were wearings masks, the president standing alone without one. At one point, he did take a White House- branded mask from his pocket and claim to reporters he had worn it elsewhere on the tour, out of public view.


  “I did not want to give the press the pleasure of seeing it," Trump said.


  For a moment, he also teasingly held up a clear shield in front of his face. A statement from Ford said that Bill Ford, the company's executive chairman, “encouraged President Trump to wear a mask when he arrived" and said the president wore it during “a private viewing of three Ford GTs from over the years" before removing it.


  The United Auto Workers union noted in a statement that “some in his entourage'” declined face masks and said “it is vitally important that our members continue to follow the protocols that have been put in place to safeguard them, their families and their communities.”


  The UAW also noted Trump's statement that he had just been tested for the virus and said it wanted to make sure he understood the wider “need for an economical instant test that can be administered daily to further protect our members -- and all Americans.”


  Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel said that mask wearing isn’t just Ford’s policy but it’s also the law in a state that’s among those hardest hit by the virus. Nessel said that if Trump refused to wear a mask Thursday “he’s going to be asked not to return to any enclosed facilities inside our state" and “we're going to have to take action” against any company that allows it in the future.


  Trump has refused to wear a face mask in public, telling aides he believes it makes him look weak, though it is a practice that federal health authorities say all Americans should adopt to help slow the spread of the virus.


  Ford said everyone in its factories must wear personal protective equipment, including masks, and that its policy had been communicated to the White House. At least two people who work in the White House and had been physically close to Trump recently tested positive for the virus.


  The Republican president and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer have clashed during the coronavirus outbreak over her criticism of the federal response to the state's needs for medical equipment, like ventilators, and personal protective gear, such as gloves, masks and gowns. Trump on Thursday criticized Democratic governors, suggesting they were proceeding too slowly in reopening their states' economies.


  “You have a lot of, unfortunately, in this case Democrat governors (who) think it’s good politics to keep it closed," Trump said. “I think they’re being forced to open, frankly, the people want to get out. You’ll break the country if you don’t."


  The day before, Trump threatened to withhold federal funds from Michigan after its secretary of state mailed absentee ballot applications to millions of voters. Trump first tweeted — falsely — that the Democratic state official had mailed absentee ballots to Michigan voters. He later sent a corrected tweet specifying that applications to request absentee ballots had been mailed and seemed to back off his funding threat.


  Trump narrowly won Michigan in 2016. He insists mail-in voting is ripe for fraud, although there is scant evidence of wrongdoing.


  “We don’t want them to do mail in ballots because it’s going to lead to total election fraud," Trump said Thursday, But then he allowed for some exceptions, including for himself.


  “Now, if somebody has to mail it in because they’re sick, or by the way because they live in the White House and they have to vote in Florida and they won’t be in Florida. But there’s a reason for it, that’s OK."


  Trying to signal to the nation that life is returning to normal, the president has begun traveling again, with all of his initial trips to states that will be hotly contested in this November’s election. Campaign advisers have grown increasingly worried about Michigan, believing that the president’s attacks on Whitmer have not worked and that the toll the virus has taken in the Detroit area, particularly among African Americans, will prove costly politically.


  Trump, at a roundtable with African American supporters in front of a sign with his slogan for reopening the economy, “Transition to Greatness," noted low minority unemployment numbers before the pandemic and also pointed to his administration's work on criminal justice reform.


  The president's advisers have become convinced that of the three Rust Belt states that Trump took from Democrats in 2016, Michigan would be much more difficult to win again than Pennsylvania and, especially, Wisconsin.


  In the early days of the crisis, Whitmer and other governors and medical workers clamored for ventilators, fearing a shortage of the machines would prove deadly as the virus made breathing difficult for the scores of afflicted patients who were being brought to hospitals.


  But the U.S. now has a surplus of the breathing machines, leading Trump to begin describing the U.S. as the “king of ventilators.”


  Whitmer did not accompany Trump during the visit.


  “We do not have plans to meet, but I did speak with him yesterday on the phone," Whitmer told "CBS This Morning” on Thursday. “I made the case that, you know, we all have to be on the same page here. We’ve got to stop demonizing one another and, really, focus on the fact that the common enemy is the virus.”

But Shierholz argues unemployment insurance is not an ideal way to deliver relief to dislocated workers. Mass layoffs, she says, would ultimately slow down the recovery, by requiring businesses to rebuild their workforce from scratch as they reopen. "It's incredibly better for both workers and businesses to furlough but not lay off," she says. "But we don't really have a culture of holding onto workers during a downturn and then just bringing them back online after the downturn is over."

India is a land of opportunity, and as a result of that, people can get quite creative in their use of their free time. That is made a lot easier by the massive increase in possibilities that are now open to them with regard to entertainment, both on and offline. People in India can now get Golden Nugget online casino promo codes to enhance their enjoyment of online gaming. Gambling has now been embraced in India as an exciting pastime, be it gambling online via casino sites or betting on horse racing.


  Gambling is just one of a number of popular hobbies currently being practiced in India, some of which are fairly universal in nature while others are rather more unique to the country.


  Many hobbies are also undertaken as a way of earning money in a non- professional capacity. Pastimes currently popular in India include digital design and illustration, writing, choreography, cooking, photography, tutoring, singing and playing musical instruments.


  Digital design is big with Indian start-up companies and, as a result, it has become a popular hobby for teenagers and young adults. Web design in India is not just an activity practiced by professionals, it has become popular among the younger generation as well. With the internet providing an even greater array of learning resources, more people have the opportunity to explore the subject and gain the abilities to make web design a hobby or even a career.


  The kind of dance moves seen in Bollywood movies have become an entertaining and exciting hobby for those who want to have fun in their spare time. Taking dance lessons is not only a lot of fun but can also help people to stay in excellent physical condition without it feeling like a lot of hard work.


  Many Indians with an enthusiasm for travel have also taken up metal detecting as a hobby. Metal detecting invokes the thrill of hunting for buried treasure and has become more popular on an international level following a number of popular television programs dedicated to the subject.


  There are different kinds of metal detectors as well as various accessories available for purchase by enthusiasts, and Indian teenagers in particular are taking up the hobby with enthusiasm.


  Photography has become a very popular hobby for the people of India, which is why many of the world’s most successful photographers actually originated from there in the first place. Possession of a camera is the only necessary qualification for someone to begin to embark on this hobby, and those who decide to make their hobby a career have no shortage of opportunities to do so with so many colorful ceremonies and events regularly taking place in India. With the sheer number and variety of advanced equipment and devices that are now available on the market, the resources are now obtainable in India to take advantage of and create amazing results from this hobby. India is certainly not short on amazing sights and scenery that are definitely worth photographing, so those who become passionate about photography are unlikely to ever become short of subjects.


  Cooking is also a popular pastime in India, not least because of the wide array of delicious tastes and flavors that the nation has to offer. Traditional cuisine includes curries, pulses, tandoori items, biryani and so on, and come with spicy, rich tastes that guarantee great flavor.


  Another popular way to pass the time in India is shopping, with a number of diverse marketplaces offering customers great variety in terms of the actual goods for sale as well as their pricing and overall quality.


  India plays host to innumerable boutiques and shopping malls in addition to traditional as well as more upscale markets, folk fairs and wholesale traders. There is a staggering variety in the country with clothing, accessories, handicrafts, shoes, gadgets, jewelry and more.


  Many shops in India stay open until the late evening, particularly in the big cities, and there are other activities for those who like to stay out including going to nightclubs, bars, coffee shops, concert halls, restaurants and cinemas.


  Those who enjoy activities such as adventure and sports also have a lot of different options to choose from in India. Related leisure activities that are particularly popular include paragliding, river rafting, bungee jumping, mountaineering and skiing. There are also many gyms and sports clubs that people can join to stay healthy.

House Republicans aren't ready for the U.S. to hand over the oversight of internet domain names to a multistakeholder model.
 The U.S. contract to oversee the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) functions of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is due to expire at the end of this month per the Obama Administration's desire to turn over authority to an international group of stakeholders.
 Republicans have said that could lead to bad actors getting control of the internet, although some Democrats have also expressed concerns about the handoff.
 In a letter to U.S. attorney general Loretta Lynch and commerce secretary Penny Pritzker, House and Senate Republican leaders said too many questions remained unanswered about the hand-over, including accountability inside ICANN, antitrust questions, and the legality of the U.S. relinquishing its current role.
 "We call on you to address the questions and concerns detailed above and to reconsider the Administration’s current plans to transition the IANA functions on October 1, 2016.”
 Signing on to the letter were Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), chair of the Commerce Committee; Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa), chair of the Judiciary Committee; Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.), chair of the Energy & Commerce Committee, and Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.

It is very upsetting and sad,” he says.

I don't hear any barking, do you? The last I looked at Canes Venatici, this pair of hunting dogs were quiet as can be. They must be sleeping. After all, the only time I see them is after dark.      Canes Venatici, of course, is a constellation, a small one at that, with only two easily visible stars. This pair is easy to find, right under the Big Dipper's handle.      When I say "under" I mean in respect to how the Big Dipper is usually pictured, like a real kitchen utensil right-side up on a table. In late May/early June in the evening, the Big Dipper is high in the northern sky, seemingly upside down as far as utensils go.      From mid-northern latitudes, like where I hang my hat in Pennsylvania (well, place my hat on the shelf), at around 9 p.m. this time of year, Canes Venatici is virtually straight overhead, in the zenith.      These stars are not bright. That may not sound nice, but I mean in magnitude. The star on the left (as seen on a spring evening), on the east side, is brightest. Cor Coroli is +3 magnitude. About 2 1/2 degrees away is +4 magnitude Chara. (A half-degree covers the apparent width of the full moon.)      Cor Coroli is a fine wide double star, a nice sight in a small telescope. The name means "the heart of Charles"; the star was named by Astronomer Royal Edmund Halley, at the suggestion of Sir Charles Scarborough in memory of King Charles I, the deposed British king.      Cor Coroli is a fine double star, easily resolved with a small telescope. The star system is 110 light-years away.      Chara has a yellow hue and is 42 light-years away.      Amateur astronomers love spotting the several relatively bright galaxies in Canes Venatici. The most well known is the Whirlpool Galaxy, also known as M51. It is close to the last star in the Big Dipper's handle and is seen as a hazy spot in binoculars on a dark night. Telescopes of 6 inches and larger easily show M51 with a companion galaxy early attached. Photographs reveal M51 as a grand spiral galaxy, seen face-on.      Astronomers have detected one of the largest almost-empty regions of space, called the "Great Void," in the general direction of Canes Venatici.

PHOENIX — A North Dakota construction company favored by President Donald Trump has received the largest contract to date to build a section of Trump’s signature wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.


  Republican U.S. Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota confirmed the $1.3 billion contract for building the 42-mile section of wall through “really tough terrain in the mountains” in Arizona. That's about $30 million per mile.


  Cramer said Fisher Sand and Gravel Co. offered the lowest price for the project. He did not know how many companies bid.


  Trump has promised to build 450 miles of wall along the border with Mexico by the end of the year. So far, the government has awarded millions of dollars in contracts for construction of 30-foot-tall barriers, along with new lighting, technology and infrastructure. The Trump administration says it has already built 187 miles of wall. Some of it is new, but most is replacing old, much shorter barriers that officials say were not sufficient.


  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said Wednesday that there was no set date to start or complete construction on the latest award. Construction will take place near Nogales, Arizona, and Sasabe, Arizona.


  Cramer said the fence will be painted black because “that’s what the president wanted, plain and simple,” Cramer said.


  The idea is that the black wall would absorb heat making it more difficult for someone to scale, he said.


  “That’s the president’s theory,” Cramer said. “Plus, it won’t be an ugly, rusty thing that everyone is putting up now.”


  The Army Corps of Engineers, which awards contracts, said Fisher was one of several companies chosen in May 2019 to partake in building $5 billion worth of border wall. This month's contract to Fisher was part of that award.


  Asked if there were any additional bidders for this latest contract, a spokesman said the agency couldn't provide that information because of “procurement sensitivities.”


  The Arizona Daily Star first reported news of the contract.


  Cramer did not know if the Trump administration's recent move to waive federal contracting laws to speed construction of the wall helped the project or sped it up. He said he didn’t know if the project fell under those rules.


  In the 2018 election cycle, company owner Tommy Fisher and his wife donated $10,800 to Cramer, who championed the company’s ability to build the wall and made Fisher his guest at Trump’s 2018 State of the Union address.


  Democratic members of Congress raised concerns in December after Fisher was awarded a $400 million contract for border wall construction. Within two weeks, the defense department's inspector general had launched an investigation, which is ongoing, according to Democratic U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, a critic who questioned whether the contract had been properly awarded.


  “If the administration cared about anything besides political optics and maximizing miles of fence in the run up to an election, they wouldn't have awarded this contract,” Thompson said in a statement on Wednesday.


  Environmentalists have also long criticized the border wall, saying it cuts off protected wildlife and destroys important ecosystems. They've filed lawsuits against the wall and the use of defense money to build it.


  “Trump’s wanton destruction of the borderlands is made even worse by this sleazy contract with a big supporter,” said Laiken Jordahl, borderlands campaigner at the Center for Biological Diversity.


  Cramer said he has personally pitched Fisher’s company to the president and others in Washington.


  “It will be a cold day in hell when I apologize for advocating for a North Dakota business,” Cramer said.

Democrats in the Senate arrived at the capital last week wearing masks in the chamber, while most Republicans chose not to don the facial coverings.


  This is just the latest expression of an attitude that goes beyond the virus. Strong conservatives don’t see the facial mask as a medical “wearable” that helps to reduce the spread of the coronavirus, they see it as a direct challenge to their freedom of choice. Strong liberals view wearing a mask as a considerate act that embraces what community health officials recommend. We have to wonder how much longer the “no compromise” school of politics will last. With the balance of power appearing to shift in the Legislature and notably in the urban centers in this state, the key to being a successful politician moving forward will require an ability to negotiate and compromise.


  Some within the Republican ranks recognize this. Accomplishing an agenda with a narrow majority means that every legislator needs to fall in line. At the capital, the dwindling strength of GOP dominance has already resulted in power plays within the ranks. Last year, Sens. Paul Boyer (R-20) and Heather Carter (R-15) held up the entire Legislature when they refused to vote for the budget until lawmakers passed a bill changing immunity laws for sexual assault. The stalemate went on for weeks until leadership within the majority surrendered and Boyer’s bill was approved.

If the American economy is to survive, let alone thrive, we need corporate leaders to step up in defense of the free market.

  There are heroes out there like Tesla’s Elon Musk, who recently stood up to Gov. Gavin Newsome and other officials who would not permit his California manufacturing plant to reopen and get people back to work. To Musk’s credit, even though his empire is built on questionable tax breaks, credits, and subsidies, he pushed back where other business leaders have sheepishly complied. He announced he’d be taking his company and the jobs he created to Texas or Nevada, where they would be welcomed. Faced with that, Newsome and company seem to have backed down.


  For every hero, there are goats like Alan Armstrong, the CEO of Williams Co., an energy pipeline company. According to recent allegations made in a Delaware court, he secretly worked to undermine a 2016 board-approved merger between his firm and Energy Transfer, a Texas-based pipeline company, that would have paid shareholders a significant premium over the then-market value of their shares.


  Nearly four years since it fell through, Williams continues to seek more than a billion dollars in breakup fees, despite Armstrong’s recently alleged involvement in the deal’s demise. According to court documents, he even worked behind the scenes with a former Williams senior vice president by using a personal account and leaking inside information to assist a lawsuit filed to block the proposed and ultimately unconsummated merger. As a result, half of his board of directors resigned days after the deal was called off, citing a lack of confidence in his ability to lead the company.

The PRO14 have confirmed that an investment deal with CVC has been completed. In a move that has long been on the cards, as the Luxembourg- based investment firm look to continue its growth within the sport, CVC will acquire a 28pc share of PRO14 Rugby, with the unions retaining a 72pc majority share.As a tournament, the PRO14 has struggled to capture the imagination of many, but it is hoped that this latest development will help improve it as a whole.The news comes on the back of the Six Nations revealing that they are in talks with SANZAAR about aligning the global calendar.CVC have already invested in Premiership Rugby, as well as Formula 1 and Moto GP.The announcement has been welcomed across the board by the various unions, as they are optimistic that it will provide rugby in this part of the world with a much-needed boost.Crucially for the PRO14, CVC maintained their commitment to invest a sum understood to be in the region of €130 million, which is the same amount as had been mooted last year, before Covid-19 struck.&quot;The partnership commitment will allow both PRO14 Rugby and the Irish, Italian, Scottish and Welsh rugby unions to continue to invest in the sport, both professional and amateur, to achieve its potential over the long term,&quot; a statement from the PRO14 read.&quot;A portion of the investment will also be held centrally at PRO14 Rugby, for the Board to invest in further capabilities for the business and in upgrading league operations in line with its growth ambitions.&quot;As part of this agreement, the Federazione Italiana Rugby (FIR), will also become a member of Celtic Rugby DAC, and receive a share of the investment.&quot;In the past four years, the Guinness PRO14 has performed well both on and off the field; doubling distributions to clubs and facilitating record investment back into the sport from the league. This has been recognised by CVC, who share PRO14 Rugby&rsquo;s vision for the long-term potential of the league.&quot;CVC was selected by PRO14 Rugby and the unions as their partner due to the extensive experience of prior CVC funds investing in multiple sports businesses, such as Formula 1, Moto GP and Premiership Rugby.&rdquo;Current PRO14 CEO Martin Anayi will continue to lead the PRO14 and will now work in conjunction with the powers that be at CVC.&quot;CVC&rsquo;s show of faith has been impressive and is in keeping with their proven track record of success when it comes to sports investment, including Formula 1, Moto GP and Premiership Rugby,&rdquo; Anayi commented.&quot;This partnership allows all of our stakeholders to plan for a sustainable period of growth, which will benefit the fans, the players and the game.&quot;We are very pleased to partner with CVC, who saw us as an ambitious, fast paced and innovative organisation, situated across a number of core rugby nations that can deliver an increasing impact.&quot;We have been clear that we believe the Guinness PRO14 is a world-class club league, that is still in its growth phase and we are confident that it will become a major standard bearer in our sport.&quot;We are excited that CVC clearly shares that ambition and we look forward to working with them to deliver on the league&rsquo;s promise in the years ahead.&quot;

The reason he acted as he did, the court was told, was out of a desire to maintain his position as CEO even if his continued leadership of the company was detrimental to shareholder interests.


  Actions like these in the corporate community have regular Americans – more and more of whom join the investor class every day through their 401Ks, Roth IRAs, and by trading stocks online – wondering if their money is safe, or if they’re just feeding corporate cats growing fat off their investments.


  Warren Buffet, one of the country’s most respected financial leaders, argued in a recent interview that not enough attention is paid to corporate leadership and governance. “Almost all of the directors I have met over the years have been decent, likable and intelligent,” he said. “Nevertheless, many of these good souls are people whom I would never have chosen to handle money or business matters. It simply was not their game.”


  If the CEOs and boards of America’s companies don’t step up to restore public confidence in who they are and what they do, then the politicians will – as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi tried to do in the first coronavirus relief bill. Other than the privileged few that would have been picked to serve on boards if her proposed amendment requiring diversity on corporate boards had been adopted, it would have been bad for business and everyone else.


  The clock is running.

So in public, Loeffler and Burr suggested things were under control even as they received closed briefings suggesting things could get seriously out of control --- and then made investments that took advantage of the grim forecast.


  But how do we know that Burr and Loeffler made the trades they did?


  Because a law called the STOCK Act (Stop Trading On Congressional Knowledge), which passed in 2012, explicitly prohibited members of Congress, their family or staff from making investments based on non-public information.


  The STOCK Act also requires members of Congress to report financial transactions within 45 days, rather than the once-yearly requirement that existed previously. The shameful back story is that when it was initially introduced, many prominent Republicans opposed the STOCK Act. At one hearing, a Republican witness essentially argued there was nothing wrong with insider trading!


  Not until a 60 Minutes exposé raised public outrage did members scramble to climb on board. Yet, even then, behind the scenes, efforts were made to weaken the final bill from its original design and reduce transparency. When the bill finally came to a vote, Richard Burr was one of only three Senators who voted “no,” calling the bill “insanity” and describing himself as a “brave soul.”


  During his 15 years in the Senate, Burr’s estimated personal net worth has grown from just over $500,000 to more than $7.4 Million in 2018.


  For her part, newly appointed Senator Loeffler was already the wealthiest member of the Senate when she made her recent trades. If that is what passes for bravery or public service in America today, we are in deep trouble. Most members of Congress hold themselves to a higher standard and are in fact public servants. Those who fail that test must be held accountable by voters.

LONDON (AP) — People arriving in the U.K. will have to quarantine themselves for 14 days and could be fined 1,000 pounds ($1,220) if they fail to comply under a plan being announced Friday by the British government.


  Home Secretary Priti Patel will set out details of the measures, which have already sparked confusion and criticism from airlines, airports and lockdown- weary Britons wondering whether they will get to take a vacation aboard this summer.


  Britain did not close its borders during the worst of the country’s coronavirus outbreak, which has been linked to more than 36,000 deaths in the U.K. It is introducing its quarantine just as many other European countries are starting to open up again.


  The British government has previously said the quarantine will start in early June and will apply to arrivals from everywhere except Ireland, which has a longstanding free-movement agreement with the U.K. There are likely to be exemptions for some travelers, including truckers and medics.


  Britons returning from overseas will also have to self-isolate for 14 days under the measures, which will be reviewed every three weeks.


  There has been confusion about the U.K. policy, after the government initially said it would not apply to people arriving from France. That prompted a rebuke from the European Union, which wants a coordinated policy across the 27-nation bloc.
