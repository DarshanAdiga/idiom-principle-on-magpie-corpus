Old political maxims clearly played out true to form in the GOP runoff for our junior U.S. Senate seat on July 14.
 Tommy Tuberville ran a very wise and disciplined campaign. He steadily stayed on point and simply said I am going to support Donald Trump. Undoubtedly , when Tuberville decided about a year ago to leave his Florida home and run for the U.S. Senate in Alabama, whoever was advising him knew that the only issue was going to be who could cozy up to Donald J. Trump the most. They gave Tuberville the script and he followed his playbook to perfection. He never deviated and never got distracted by issues, questions, or debates. He simply rode the Donald Trump horse all the way home.

Two more Floyd County Sheriff’s Office employees have tested positive for COVID-19.
 If there’s good news in this story, it’s that the two had either limited contact or no contact with jail inmates and staff, according to Jail Administrator Maj. Bob Sapp.
 “We’re continuing to monitor it daily,” Sapp said. “We’re continuing the prescreens, wearing of face coverings and masks, social distancing and disinfecting.”
 An employee who tested positive last week has already tested negative for the virus, Sapp said, and is slated to return to work Aug. 13.
 One of the newly positive employees worked in the same area as the first one, with limited contact between other employees and inmates, he said. Neither of those two displayed symptoms of the virus.
 The third employee who tested positive works in the warrants division and had not been at work for over a week when they began exhibiting symptoms, so there aren’t any known exposures from the staff or the inmates.
 So far, none of the inmates at the jail have exhibited any symptoms, Sapp said. However, he said there are a few in quarantine who have had fevers or were feeling under the weather.
 “Even before the pandemic, if an inmate had any kind of temperature, we would quarantine them in medical,” Sapp said. “We do have a few COVID-19 tests available, but no inmates have developed any symptoms yet.”
 The jail staff leaves it up to the medical division to determine if an inmate needs to be tested. The decision is be based on symptoms the inmate is exhibits, who they have been around and where they came from before being booked into the jail.
 Sapp said jail officers enforce social distancing between inmates as much as possible. The inmates also wear face coverings when they leave their cell blocks and when they’re out in public on work detail.
 “If we catch them not wearing a mask during their work detail, they will be locked down,” he said.
 Over the last week, the sheriff’s office staff has increased their disinfecting procedures, using special products that help kill the coronavirus. They’re also looking at adding plexiglass screens in the booking area as well as other areas to limit close interactions between officers, inmates and the general public.
 “We’re also looking to come up with a way to open up our fingerprinting to the public again and have a plexiglass to separate people we’re fingerprinting from our staff,” Sapp said.
 The sheriff’s office will be receiving new screening equipment in the next two weeks.
 The digital equipment, an R.S. Tech Fever Screening System, will take employees’ pictures and check their temperature at the same time, then automatically store the data into a system. This will help staff keep better track of employees’ normal temperatures and health statuses over the next months.
 “We’re anticipating delivery this week, but if not, it’ll be next week,” Sapp said.

THE COST OF LEASING
 One appeal of leasing is that it’s easier to qualify for promotional lease rates than for promotional loan APR offers, and that’s reflected in the current low average monthly lease payments. In June, the average lease payment was about $461.
 Over the hypothetical equivalent of a six-year lease, a lessee would pay a total of $33,192. That’s significantly less than our purchased vehicle example.
 However, that amount doesn’t include the down payment, which on average can be $2,000 or more. Since lease terms are usually 36 months, a shopper would have to lease two vehicles to match our buying example. That means making two down payments, bringing the total cost closer to $37,000 (or potentially more if you upgraded on the second vehicle).
 That’s still less than what our average buyer in the previous scenario spent. But consider that the lessee is left without an asset. If you factor in the value of a vehicle at the end of a loan term, the average lessee actually winds up more in the red than a purchaser, to the tune of about $9,000. So is there any reason to lease?
 CONSIDER OTHER ASPECTS OF OWNERSHIP
 A major appeal of leasing is that your vehicle will always be under warranty, so you don’t have to worry about unexpected repairs, just routine maintenance.
 For a buyer, maintenance costs can get more expensive over six years, as items such as tires, batteries and brakes begin to wear. Automotive bumper-to-bumper warranties also typically expire after three years. Depending on the vehicle and your driving habits, buying can get pricey.

The center’s opening this summer obviously would have made a much grander splash had it not been for the coronavirus pandemic, which we are fighting in part by minimizing our visits to public places, such as swimming pools. Instead of a big party, city officials, District 2 representatives and the contracting team marked its completion Friday morning with a low-key, invitation-only and socially distanced ceremony.
 The pool actually opened several days ago, but because of COVID-19, the city restricted users to lap and open swimming, the same as at its Danny Jones and Felix Pinckney pools. Access to swimming programs will expand post-pandemic. The daily charge for swimmers is $3, which will rise to $5 on Sept. 1, when monthly and annual passes go on sale; those outside the city pay the same rate since many Dorchester County taxpayers helped pay for it.
 The competition-size pool can be divided in half, giving the public a space to swim even when school teams are using the pool. Only during a swim meet or other events will the pool be unavailable to the public. Now, more than 50 swimmers can use it at a time.
 North Charleston Recreation Director Doyle Best says the city might make a pitch for the South Carolina High School League’s state championship later this year, though COVID-19 continues to cast a fog over fall athletic programs. In any case, he says, “We’re looking forward to hosting some really great meets in the future.”
 That seems a certainty, and North Charleston’s recreational renaissance is driven not only to serve residents but to increase recreational tourism. Last fall, the city opened the $14 million North Charleston Athletic Center off Interstate 26 near Remount Road. It’s also expected to draw regional, state and even national competitions that in turn will draw visitors to the city. North Charleston’s baseball and softball fields at Wescott Park, completed in 2013, marked its first major step in this direction.
 We congratulate the city on finding creative ways to spur its tourism while also, and even more importantly, giving its residents new and better options for play.

"There's no drama here. Everyone roots for each other," Price said. "It's awesome. I love it here and everyone is welcomed with open arms."
 The first nine holes of play on Tuesday will set 10 groups of players flighted in by their scores. The first group tees off at 8:32 a.m. Golfers in Flights C and D, who played the back nine this week, will head to the front nine next Tuesday while Flights A and B will head from the front nine to the back nine.
 The league will continue throughout the month of August, something that was not a guarantee when several activities had to be canceled to help mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Cedar Creek's reopening back in mid-April allowed both the Thursday men's senior league and Tuesday's women's league to get back out on the course at the start of June.
 "We've had some players that have situations that they have to be more aware of the COVID situation. We work with that to make sure everyone can stay healthy and enjoy being a part of the league," Price said.
 "Greg (Wilson) has also done a great job of helping make sure everything is safe for us, getting PVC noodles in the holes at first so we didn't have to reach in at first," George added. "We take turns also bringing food out because we can't have luncheons. We work together really well and we're always looking for new members."

“I’m here to just support my town,” Momence resident Michael Quirk said. “I think just like everyone else, everyone is fed up with all the protests and stuff, and I think the mayor took offense when that happened. I think he took it to heart because he knows that this isn’t a racist town. There’s no bigotry or anything, and it just got spun out and everyone took their opportunity.”
 Several people spoke during the citizen forum portion of the meeting, including Julia McDonald, of Kankakee, who asked the mayor for a public apology.
 “We ask that you let go of your defensiveness and instead open your eyes and your ears,” she said in part. “Listen to people when they have something to say on these streets, whether you agree with them or not.”
 Normon Davis, a Black Momence resident, spoke during the forum in support of Steele, who he has known for 24 years. Davis said he grew up in the housing projects in Chicago.
 “In no way does he deserve the title of racist,” Davis said. “... He’s shown a lot of generosity throughout the community. Over the 24 years he’s shown without words his compassion and his love for the community.
 “Being reared in the housing projects, I know firsthand what true racism is, and Mayor Chuck Steele does not fit the bill.”
 After he addressed the council, Davis said residents support Steele.
 “Momence is one of the most peaceful towns that you’ll encounter in the United States,” Davis said. “We’re a small community. ... The bottom line is this right here — get to know someone before you pass judgment.”
 During the mayor’s report during the council meeting, Steele said he and Police Chief Brian Brucato attended the NAACP law enforcement meeting in July in Kankakee .
 “Brian has already signed the 10 Shared Principles, and we will be getting posters of that made up,” Steele said. “We will be bringing that to the council next meeting to have the council approve it also.”
 The 10 Shared Principles are measures designed to build trust between law enforcement and communities of color. The Momence Police will also adopt the #8cantwait de-escalation initiatives for police.
 “For the most part we already do most of everything that’s on there, and I support our police department 100 percent,” said Steele, who declined to comment any further after the meeting.

SYDNEY, AUG 4: Australia's October Twenty20 series against the West Indies was called off Tuesday, as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect the international sporting calendar.   It follows the postponement of the T20 World Cup, scheduled for October- November in Australia, and this month's one-day international series against Zimbabwe.   Cricket Australia said the three-match West Indies series had been intended as a warm-up to the T20 World Cup, but could no longer serve that purpose.   "In light of this development... it has been agreed to postpone the matches," CA said in a statement.   The series will be take place ahead of the rescheduled T20 World Cup, on dates yet to be decided in either 2021 or 2022.   Australia is currently struggling with a second wave of coronavirus infections and its international borders remain closed, with arrivals required to undergo 14-day quarantine. Despite the logistical difficulties, Cricket Australia insists a money-spinning four-Test series against India in December-January will proceed.    -AFP

LONDON, AUG 4: Footballers can be sent off if referees judge they have coughed deliberately at opponents or match officials in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, say the sport's rule-makers and England's Football Association.   The International Football Association Board (IFAB) said it was up to the referee to judge whether he felt the cough was an abusive gesture.   IFAB classified deliberate coughing as similar to "using offensive, insulting or abusive language and/or gestures".   "As with all offences, the referee has to make a judgement about the true nature of the offence," it said.   "If it were clearly accidental, then the referee would not take action nor if the 'cough' took place with a large distance between the players.   "However, where it is close enough to be clearly offensive, then the referee can take action."   The FA's guidance for grassroots football in England will come into force immediately.   "If the incident was not severe enough to merit a sending-off, a caution could be issued for 'unsporting behaviour'," it wrote in a document.

Law enforcement agencies that participate in the North Georgia Elder Abuse Task Force met face to face in Rome on Tuesday for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic exploded across the region.
 Officers exchanged information about some of their recent cases, which range from people depleting their elderly parents’ bank accounts to romance scams and swindles related to the new coronavirus.
 Some of the scams involved the theft of as much as $400,000.
 Rome District Attorney Leigh Patterson lamented the fact that since the COVID-19 state of emergency was first declared in mid-March, she has not been able to bring together a grand jury to indict anyone arrested over the last five months.
 “The feds have got a grand jury, but we don’t,” Patterson said.
 The impact of that, according to the district attorney, is that some defendants who have been charged with crimes against the elderly have been able to bond out of jail.
 Patterson said after the meeting that a majority of the elder abuse cases that are presented to her office involve financial crimes. She said the defendants are typically family members.
 “By the time we find the case, they’ve usually been stealing for a long time,” Patterson said. “They’ve got bank accounts, passwords, and they’re busy stealing as they’re leaving.”
 Floyd County Police Sgt. Chris Fincher detailed the Operation Lifesaver program for the attending officers who represented jurisdictions across Northwest Georgia.
 The program involves attaching a hospital-style armband with a tiny transmitter, about the size of a watch. The units — which cost around $350 — are made available to caretakers of people with forms of dementia to help find those who tend to walk away from their home at any opportunity.
 When police are called to start a manhunt, they use a receiver that pings when it detects a signal from the transmitter.
 The Area Agency on Aging has helped distribute some of the devices to families in the Rome area. Pickens County Sheriff’s Office personnel at the meeting Tuesday said they also use the program over in the Jasper area.
 Joe Gavalis, the regional task force coordinator, also introduced the law enforcement personnel to another locater system, called a scent kit.
 The kit contains a preserved scent from the individual for a dog to follow. It is expected to keep for about six years. The task force is making some of the scent kits available to agencies on a trial basis.
 The Berry College Police Department, charged with some of the responsibilities for security at The Spires, also sent four officers to the meeting to learn about issues impacting senior citizens.

Good day to all! Did you know that at one time most of what is now Port Charlotte was ranch land owned by Arthur C. Frizzell? A.C., as he was widely known, was born, 1890, in Glencoe, Alabama, and came to what would become Charlotte County in 1918.
 Trained as a telegrapher in nearby Gadsden, Alabama, by his future wife Patti Standifer, they married in 1913, their first jobs in Florida were station agents and telegraphers for the Charlotte Harbor and Northern Railroad (CH&N) at Ona near Zolfo Springs. A few years later A.C. became agent at CH&N’s Murdock station, while Miss Patti was assigned to Gardner, a few miles north of Arcadia, both just “whistle stops” at the time. The story goes, he lost his job shortly thereafter when the railroad president made a surprise visit and discovered him tending his vegetable garden, rather that his railroad duties. However, that didn’t stop A.C. and Patti, true entrepreneurs at heart.
 It wasn’t long before he and Miss Patti purchased a small general store at Murdock and a bit of pine woods. While Patti ran the store, A.C. operated their turpentine still just east of Murdock at a CH&N loading dock called Mars. When the trees died, he sawed them into lumber and used the proceeds to buy more pine woods that was generally undesirable to the large timber companies, but accessible to his small, portable sawmill.
 Frizzell then used those proceeds to purchase logged out land from the larger companies to harvest and sell leftover stumps to Hercules Powder Company, out of Jacksonville, for processing into various products. When the stumps were gone, he had the palmettos scraped and grass planted for his growing cattle operation. He’s credited with bringing in the area’s first load of Brahman cattle from Texas to improve his herd. When the great depression hit, he bought land for back taxes and by 1950 his holdings exceeded 80,000 acres.
 When Miss Patti died soon thereafter, Frizzell decided to sell all but 40 acres in Murdock, located about where the Days Inn is today, to Yellowknife Bear Mines, Ltd. of Canada. Yellowknife had formed a partnership with prominent Miami developers Robert and Frank Mackle, who began building small homes on newly created Easy Street, catering to northern retirees. After building 200 or so homes, they merged with another company, formed a subsidiary, General Development Corporation, and the rest is history.
 Mr. A.C. died in his sleep of heart failure in early 1961 and is interred in the historic Charlotte Harbor Cemetery. Unfortunately, A.C. Frizzell related photographs can no longer be viewed by visiting Charlotte County History Collections “online,” since the site has been deactivated. Hopefully, they will be accessible again within a few months.

innanzitutto sono contento che si possano dismettere i toni di una polemica alla fine sterile per provare a ragionare nel merito.

Real Madrid midfielder Casemiro said playing behind closed doors at Manchester City can help the LaLiga holders overturn their Champions League deficit.
 Madrid travel to Etihad Stadium for the second leg of their Champions League last-16 tie against Pep Guardiola's City on Friday, having lost the opener 2-1 prior to the coronavirus-enforced break.
 Gabriel Jesus and Kevin De Bruyne condemned Madrid – who had captain Sergio Ramos sent off in the Spanish capital – to defeat at the Santiago Bernabeu in February.
 Madrid have a mountain to climb in Manchester, but star Casemiro believes Zinedine Zidane's side can benefit from playing without fans on the road.
 "Without fans it's a different game," Brazil international Casemiro told Esporte Interactivo.
 "It will be a very good game and difficult for both sides, but we're Real Madrid and we know we have a chance to go through.
 "They won't have their fans and that might favour us a little.
 "But the players are the same, the coach is the same and we all know that the difficulty level will be the same because they're a great team."

MADISON, Wis. — Gov. Tony Evers pushed back Tuesday against Republican claims that he's secretly planning to shut down Wisconsin schools this fall, saying he's content to let local officials decide whether to offer in-person or online instruction as the coronavirus continues to spread across the state.
 Evers on Saturday declared a state of emergency to give himself the authority to impose a statewide mask mandate. Republican legislators have decried the mandate as an affront to personal liberty and fear the governor will next use his emergency powers to shutter schools and force them to offer online instruction only. Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald has called for an extraordinary legislative session to end the state of emergency; Assembly Speaker Robin Vos has yet to agree to such a session, however.
 Evers tried to defuse GOP concerns during a video conference with reporters. He said it's impossible to know how bad the pandemic will be by Sept. 1 — giving himself an out — but said he has no secret plans to close schools and he's confident local leaders can make their own decisions.
 “I wouldn't pay attention to this conversation between Scott Fitzgerald and myself,” Evers said. “We can have all this back and forth at the state level, it makes for good media, but what's happening at the end of the day is local conversations.”
 Fitzgerald said in a statement that he doesn't trust the governor, saying his actions speak louder than words. He pointed out that Evers initially said he wouldn't try to postpone the state's April elections and then attempted to do just that before the conservative leaning state Supreme Court blocked him. Evers for weeks also said he didn't think he would issue a mask mandate and did anyway.
 “I'm fearful that he will cave to pressures from liberal groups and backtrack once again,” Fitzgerald said. “The fight isn't over yet, and legislators will remain vigilant. I would urge citizens of Wisconsin who support in-person instruction to keep the pressure on the governor.”
 Evers told reporters Tuesday that he was disappointed that President Donald Trump has decided to reduce federal funding for National Guard troops assigned to coronavirus relief. Nearly every state has lobbied the president to extend federal funding to the end of the year. Trump on Monday reauthorized funding through Dec. 31 but will require states to pick up a quarter of the costs.
 Guard members have played a key role in staffing public testing sites around Wisconsin. They also filled in as poll workers during the April election and hundreds of staffers refused to work out of fear of contracting the virus. Evers said the state will have to come up with about $4 million to fill the gap in federal funding, adding the state wouldn't be “anywhere near where we are today” in the fight against the virus without the Guard's help.
 State election officials said Tuesday local clerks are about 900 poll workers short for the Aug. 11 primary and are working with the Guard on a plan to again use troops to help. Evers has not officially activated the Guard for such a mission.
 The state Department of Health and Human Services reported 728 newly confirmed COVID-19 cases on Tuesday, bringing the state’s total to 56,056 cases. The department reported 12 more people have died of the disease, bringing the death toll to 961. The percentage of positive tests dipped to 4%, however, the lowest percentage in the last two weeks.

Summerville residents are getting a sneak peak at the town's future and a chance to offer input in a series of public events.
 Next week, the town is hosting three online input meetings to present a draft of its comprehensive plan for the area's next 20 years. Some of the subjects covered in the draft include economic development, land use, natural resources and traffic.
 For the past couple of years, the town has battled to maintain a balance between keeping a small town feel and fostering growth.
 In 2010, the Census Bureau reported 40,409 people living in Summerville. That number grew to 52,549 in 2019. In its comprehensive plan draft, the town estimates that 54,454 people will be living in Summerville in by 2023.
 Updating a comprehensive plan isn't voluntary. South Carolina local governments are required by law to create and update plans every 10 years. The strategy is also expected to cover information such as public transportation and zoning to dictate future land use.
 In next week's sessions, residents will have the opportunity to address questions and concerns on the information mapped out in the growth strategy. Jessi Shuler, director of planning for the town, said the plan is an overarching look at the town's future.
 "It doesn’t necessarily get down into the nitty-gritty details," she said.
 The sessions and the draft will not answer residents' questions around the specifics of how certain town goals will be accomplished. It will offer a blueprint of what residents can likely expect.
 Shuler said they worked with an advisory committee that included residents throughout the writing of the draft. She said they are hoping the document answers most people's questions.
 “This is kind of the final round of public input to give folks a chance to have their voice heard," she said.
 One of the most highly discussed topics in the area is traffic. Cane Bay, Nexton and Carnes Crossroads could potentially bring 30,000 homes to the Summerville area. That space is referred to as the megacluster.
 With those developments and others have also come issues around traffic along North Main Street. Some of the goals for assisting with alleviating traffic in the plan include creating more opportunities for parking and increased pedestrian mobility with sidewalks.
 The creation of the Berlin G. Myers Expressway is listed as an opportunity for helping with traffic. It will serve as a bypass around Summerville's downtown area.
 The plan also touches on the Lowcountry Rapid Transit that is being organized by the Berkeley-Charleston-Dorchester Council of Governments. The bus route would run along U.S. Highway 78 in Summerville and parallel to Interstate 26 down into Charleston.
 "Those are the major paradigm shifts we need to be looking at," said Jason Crowley, the communities and transportation director for the Coastal Conservation League.
 There needs to be more opportunities in the area for people to move around without the use of a single vehicle, he said.
 The first online information session for the event is at 9 a.m. Monday. Residents can register online to join in on the meeting. There will also be additional sessions at 1 p.m. Tuesday and 6 p.m. Wednesday.
 Residents can go online to the town's event's page to learn more.
 Session attendees will spend the first couple of minutes listening to a town presentation. That will be followed by the opportunity to ask any questions.
 Mayor Ricky Warring said he expects Town Council to approve the plan.
 “I hadn't heard anything too negative about it," he said.
 After next week, the town's planning commission will take a final look at the comprehensive plan draft before presenting it to council.

Schools in Georgia need to limit group sizes, require masks and consider shutting down if outbreaks flare amid the COVID-19 pandemic as hundreds of thousands of kids head back to class this month, an infectious disease expert in Atlanta stressed Tuesday.
 Parents and kids also need to mind what they do outside school settings since a young student who catches the virus can quickly spread it on buses, cafeterias and sports fields, said Dr. Marybeth Sexton, a member of the Serious Communicable Disease Unit at Emory University Hospital and a former Atlanta public school teacher.
 Among more drastic measures, Sexton said schools should consider staggering lunch times, limit school buses to one student per seat, pull the plug on teacher lounges, hold classes outdoors if possible and keep kids in the same classroom rather than switching locations for different teachers.
 “This is a time for people to really think about if this is incredibly important to us, to have kids in school – and it should be – what are we willing to do to make it happen?” Sexton said in a briefing Tuesday.
 Many Georgia students began returning to in-person classes this week for the 2020-21 school year, following statewide school closures in March that prompted students to complete courses online.
 As the fall semester kicks off, state officials have left it to local districts whether to hold classes in person or start off with virtual learning. Several districts have also decided to delay the start of classes for a few weeks, a move Sexton said schools would be wise to consider.
 If all schools waited until after Labor Day to reconvene, and if people adhered to distancing, masking and cleanliness measures during that time, Sexton said Georgia could make big headway in curbing the spread of a virus that has a two-week incubation period before it can take root in classrooms.
 “One of the best ways to get kids back to school is to do the things that are going to protect all of us, no matter what,” Sexton said.
 But Sexton acknowledged keeping kids at home can be tough on parents juggling work with child care and could potentially lead to worse disparities between students who have consistent access to the internet and those who don’t.
 Perhaps most important is for students to understand the reasons why wearing masks and keeping their distance from each other should be done, particularly for kindergarten-age students and teenagers with rebellious streaks, Sexton said.
 “There probably does have to be a sense of you are not coming in my classroom if you do not have a mask on,” Sexton said. “Because that’s what’s safe for you, that’s what’s safe for your classmates and that’s what protects the teacher.”
 Much of Sexton’s advice squared with guidelines the state Department of Education released over the summer to help local school districts decide how to hold classes in the fall via a mix of in-person classes and online instruction options.
 State School Superintendent Richard Woods has stressed the importance of in- person classes on Georgia students’ quality of education but supports local districts making their own decisions on when to start classes and how to hold them safely.
 “The first day of school will be the first day of school,” Woods said last month. “You can expect hiccups. You can expect challenges. But I guarantee your kids will be safe, your teachers will be safe and we will learn.”

 Both list protecting our environment as their top priority, which would serve their district, our community and, really, the entire state well. Although environmental concerns are gaining ground at the Statehouse, there are still a number of powerful legislators who are more interested in promoting drilling off the coast than tourism and our quality of life along the coast.

 The Myrtle Beach-Conway-North Myrtle Beach metro area endured 188 total business closures — both temporary and permanent — between Mar. 1 and July 10, according to Yelp, a publicly traded review site that releases quarterly data that gauges the local economic temperature throughout the U.S. Business closures are signaled by a business owner marking the business as closed, including by changing its hours or through a COVID-19 banner on its Yelp page. Closures have been vetted by its User Ops team or have been updated directly by a business owner, according to Yelp.
 But the city of Myrtle Beach and the Myrtle Beach Regional Economic Development Corporation have a plan through a memorandum of understanding signed in January. It's an economic development initiative between the city and the MBREDC that addresses the gray area of development in the region — not manufacturing and tech like the MBREDC would handle and not located in the downtown area like Lauren Clever's downtown development department would handle.
 "One element that the city should really pay attention to is, ‘How do you attract the right business here?’... and that’s what (Sandy Davis, president and CEO of MBREDC) is going to help the city with so we can develop a process so that we have the ability to have a database that says here’s our target, here’s where we can go find them and let’s start recruiting. So that we have an opportunity to fill these vacant buildings.”
 Places like Sticky Fingers, a South Carolina-based barbecue restaurant, are included in the permanent closures. Sticky Fingers announced early in the pandemic that it was closing its doors due to COVID-19 via a recorded phone message to guests calling the restaurant. A message sent to Sticky Fingers’ corporate offices was not immediately returned.
