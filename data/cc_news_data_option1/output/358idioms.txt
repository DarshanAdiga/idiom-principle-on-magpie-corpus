The use of heat sealing tester for packaging materials is becoming imperative as low quality hot seals can potentially create issues in the vertical form- fill-seal packaging industry. The heat sealing testing technology does not destroy the package seal that it is testing, which remain a primary factor pushing the demand for sealing tester. Moreover, surging demand for determining the sealing strength of two packaging surfaces is providing a strong impetus to heat sealing tester sales.

There was nothing cooler than the Lakers when I was coming in to sports consciousness. Sadly, I barely remember the 90s Cowboys Super Bowl teams. The Mavs & Rangers were historically awful franchises at the SAME TIME. Yeah, the Stars were great but let’s be honest Texas kids, we didn’t know much hockey outside of Mighty Ducks. The sport had just come to town.
 From about ages 8-14, everything in my stratosphere was about searching for “cool.” LA was cool. My cool Uncle lived in LA. Shaq was cool and he chose to move there. Kobe was cool. Then something happened. A “cool” billionaire bought my team. He built a young and exciting team that built me up, broke my heart and then built me up again for over a decade.
 Around this time Kobe did some “uncool” things. Not the least of which was constantly winning in the most clutch moments when my team and my superstar couldn’t seem to. My admiration turned to “sports hate” and eventually respect. To see it all culminate in the 2011 playoffs was surreal.
 My team didn’t beat the Lakers. We certainly didn’t sweep them en route to a title while they were in pursuit of a “three-peat.” But it did happen. It was stunning. All the while, even up 3-0, I still expected the Lakers to come back and win. That’s what winners do.
 Kobe’s talent was undeniable, but his work ethic and drive were the real prize characteristics. That feeling...when you know you’re willing to work harder than everyone else to get the job done, even if it means losing other things that are important to you. Not many people in this world know that feeling.
 I don’t know if Kobe was a good guy. He sure seemed like he loved his kids. All I know is that in my lifetime watching basketball (and I’ve spent a lot of it watching the NBA-probably too much) there was not a bigger badass on the court, as much as it pained me to know it sometimes. This is an epically sad day and an historic one.

 ORLANDO, Fla. -- The Pro Bowl turned into a Kobe Bryant tribute.
 Green Bay's Za'Darius Smith, Tampa Bay's Shaq Barrett and Detroit's Darius Slay got together following a second-quarter sack and faked fadeaway jumpers in an homage to Bryant. Smith and several NFC teammates did it again following a fumble early in the third.
 Green Bay receiver Davonte Adams pointed to the sky and flashed the No. 24 on his fingers as an ode to Bryant's jersey after a touchdown catch in the third.
 Seattle quarterback Russell Wilson led a prayer with teammates before the game in the locker room.
 The NFL's annual all-star game also held a moment of silence for Bryant at the 2-minute warning in the first half, showing the retired NBA star's picture on the scoreboards while announcing his death at age 41.
 Several players removed their helmets during the break. Others took a knee and seemed to pray. Fans broke the silence by chanting \"Ko-be! Ko-be!\"
 Players checked cellphones for updates before and during the game, all of them looking for information and answers.
 Bryant died in a helicopter crash early Sunday near Calabasas, California, and the news put a damper on the NFL event held on the other side of the country.
 The AFC ended up beating the NFC 38-33 for a fourth consecutive victory in Orlando. The latest one might have been the last near Walt Disney World. The NFL is considering moving the game around, with new, multi-billion-dollar stadiums in Las Vegas and Los Angeles being viable options.
 The play of the day was Pittsburgh linebacker T.J. Watt's 82-yard fumble return in the fourth. Jacksonville defensive lineman Calais Campbell beat Dallas' Travis Frederick and sacked Kirk Cousins on a fourth-and-goal play from the 9. Campbell stripped the ball, which Watt scooped up and went untouched the other way to put the AFC ahead 38-27.
 The NFC had a chance to rally late and tried to take advantage of a new rule that allows the scoring team to retain possession by facing a fourth-and-15 play from its own 25-yard line. Cousins threw a deep ball that Baltimore safety Earl Thomas intercepted.

 AFC players earned $70,000 for winning the game. NFC players got $35,000 each.

Times were tough for the Celtics during the middle of a long winter in 2007.
 From Jan. 7 to Feb. 11, they set a franchise record by losing 18 straight games as part of what would be a 24-win season, and the only light at the end of the tunnel was the possibility of winning the draft lottery to select either Greg Oden or Kevin Durant.
 Through all that futility, the absolute low point occurred on the night of Jan. 31, 2007 when the building known then as the TD Banknorth Garden felt like an arena on the opposite coast.
 As the Celtics were being handed their 13th straight setback that night by the Los Angeles Lakers, the usual "Beat LA'' chants were replaced by "MVP'' that were directed at Lakers guard Kobe Bryant.
 In three-and-a-half decades covering the Celtics, that scene ranks right up there among the strangest this reporter has witnessed.
 Certainly, opposing players have been recognized for their performances against Boston teams, but a member of the Lakers being given the "MVP" chant? That was unheard of, unthinkable, and a once-in-a-lifetime moment.
 The Garden was taken over by Lakers fans wearing LA jerseys that night as the Celtics fell to 12-33 with a starting lineup consisting of Al Jefferson, Gerald Green, Ryan Gomes, Delonte West and Kendrick Perkins. Brian Scalabrine scored 17 points off the bench, a rookie named Rajon Rondo scored two points with four assists and Paul Pierce was out with an injury.
 Bryant stole the show with 43 points to help beat the Celtics, 111-98, hitting 13 of 25 shots with seven 3-pointers, eight rebounds and eight assists.
 Those Lakers fans in attendance and some Celtics fans frustrated at the state of their team serenaded Bryant with those loud "MVP'' chants.
 "It felt amazing having that chant take place at that time,'' said Bryant in reflection nearly nine years later. "But it was a different animal, too, because the Celtics were really struggling. It was a great opportunity for the undercover Lakers fans to come out to Boston for the game.
 "It was a little deceptive because there were so many Lakers fans. But 2008 on, that wasn't going to happen.''
 The year 2008 is when Bryant got to play for an NBA championship in the Garden, reviving the old Celtics-Lakers rivalry not only that season but in 2010 as well.
 Bryant, who called himself a basketball historian, was thrilled to have that opportunity since Boston was always a special stop on the NBA circuit.
 Other than that one night in 2007, Bryant was a villain in Boston, but his game was thoroughly appreciated by Celtics fans, who are mourning the death of a basketball legend and his 13-year-old daughter, Gianna, in a helicopter crash that killed seven others on Sunday in California.
 It was stunning news that brought everything to a standstill, the 41-year-old Bryant gone in shocking fashion.
 For basketball fans, he leaves behind plenty of memories, and even though the Celtics and Lakers played just twice a year, he put on a lot of shows during 17 regular-season visits to Boston.
 His final trip was Dec. 30, 2015 when a bad Lakers team defeated the Celtics, 112-104, with Bryant missing 13 of 18 shots but hitting a clutch 3-pointer with less than two minutes to go for the clincher.
 Byrant's career was celebrated that night in Boston since it was his farewell performance in these parts, and there were "Kobe Bryant'' chants as the game went on. He received a loud ovation during pregame introductions, was booed as soon as the game started, then got a resounding sendoff.
 Bryant's wife, Vanessa, and their children made the trip to the East Coast to witness his last Boston game.
 "It was great, man,'' said Bryant of the atmosphere. "Being able to say thank you to the fans, it was a beautiful moment. It was unbelievable. It felt great to get booed. The recognition at the top of the game, and then as soon as I touched the ball and they booed, I was like 'Ah.' It felt great.
 "You know, honestly if I could chant for them, I would. I don't think the fans here really understand how much they drove me. From the singing of the songs, the shaking of the bus going back to the hotel, you know, that stuff really stuck with me.
 "I mean it drove me to maniacal proportions, you know what I mean? So I don't think they really understand (what) they meant to my career. I wish I could do more to show my gratitude to them. And I just tried to say thank you as much as I possibly could.
 "This place has really meant a lot for my career. I can't stress that enough. And this is why I wanted my kids here. I wanted my family here.''
 One season after Bryant received those "MVP'' chants, the Celtics made wholesale changes, acquiring both Ray Allen and Kevin Garnett, and suddenly a Boston-LA pairing in the NBA Finals was a strong possibility.
 Bryant longed for the chance to face the Celtics with a title on the line, and it became reality with the Celtics winning in 2008 and the Lakers taking the rematch in 2010.
 "When that came to be, it was like, 'Whoa, this will be pretty cool,'" Bryant said. "Then it was like, 'OK, I can't mess this up.'
 "I grew up a really big historian of the game and understanding Boston's history, the players, the lineage of the players, the championships won. This place was always special to me from the first time I came into the league. The history is what I think makes this city different from all the rest.
 "It's always cool when I come here. I always look into the rafters and scan the crowd and kind of appreciate the sea of green."

Both congratulated each other on their awards season recognition.
 The luncheon is an annual chance for all Oscar nominees to rub shoulders, celebrate the status many will only have once, and take a class picture.
 Democratized seating arrangements often pair little-known nominees in categories like documentary short or sound-design with major stars nominated in acting categories.
 Eleven-time nominee Diane Warren, nominated for writing the original song “I’m Standing With You” from “Breakthrough,” chatted with newbie nominee director Matthew Cherry, telling him and producer Karen Rupert Toliver that their animated short “Hair Love” was “amazing.”
 Monday’s luncheon menu will be entirely plant-based and the academy announced Monday that it is increasing the plant-based options at its post-Oscars Governors Ball, where winners get their Oscar statuettes engraved. This year’s Governor’s Ball menu, which is traditionally prepared by Wolfgang Puck, will be 70-percent plant-based.
 The move follows the Golden Globes and other events that have gone to entirely plant-based menus as part of some in the industry advocating for a more sustainable approach to Hollywood’s lengthy awards season.
 Joaquin Phoenix in his Globes acceptance speech praised the event for keeping meat off the menu, and urged his fellow actors to stop using private jets to get to nearby destinations like the Palm Springs International Film Festival.
 Phoenix’s “Joker” is this year’s leading Oscar nominee with 11, followed closely behind by “1917,” “The Irishman” and “Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood” all close behind with 10 apiece

The pilot, identified as Ara Zobayan, and eight passengers — including Bryant and his daughter — were killed. Orange Coast College baseball coach John Altobelli, 56, his wife, Keri, and their daughter Alyssa, who played on the same club team as Gianna, also were killed. Christina Mauser, who was the top assistant coach of the Mamba girls’ basketball team, as well as a mother and daughter from Orange County, identified by family and friends as Sarah and Payton Chester, also died in the crash.
 Officials say the recovery effort at the crash site is expected to take days.
 As officials work to find answers about what went wrong during the flight, Southern Californians continue to mourn the death of an athlete who over the course of his 20-year career became one of the greatest shooting guards in the history of basketball.
 In Newport Beach, where Bryant lived with his family for years, two young girls dressed in Lakers colors — purple and gold — dropped flowers off at a bench outside Harbor Day School, adding to a makeshift memorial that has sprouted over the last day. The Bryant family was active at the private school, where two of his daughters had attended.
 Two bouquets propped up under the school’s entrance sign were left with letters, one addressed to “Gigi, Mr. Bryant and Mrs. Mauser, Forever in our Hearts” and the other “To Mr. Bryant, Gigi and Mrs. Mauser, Our 3 Angels.”
 Maria Paun, 81, used her walker to deliver an assortment of pink flowers to the front of the school, depositing them on a bench. It was years ago, she said, that she sat with Bryant on a bench at the school when he was waiting to pick up one of his daughters and she was waiting for her granddaughter.
 “He gave me a hug and he said, ‘I like your accent, Grandma,’ ” she said. “He was tall, and he was somebody and I’m nobody, but he bent down to give me a hug. And I never forget this hug.”
 Paun said it was no accident that she wore a purple sweater Monday morning. She did so because “he liked the color.”
 “It’s hard for me, and it’s hard for everyone,” she said, her voice cracking with emotion.
 During a vigil Sunday night, Bryant’s fellow Newport Beach residents spoke of the athlete’s life outside of his storied NBA career. He was, first and foremost, a dedicated father whose love for his family was apparent to anyone who came across him, friends say. He was also the type of man whose fame never got in the way of his sharing a warm greeting at Starbucks or the grocery store.
 Mario Nunes, 50, hung his Kobe Bryant jersey from one of the tables in front of the Pavilions grocery store on Newport Coast Drive, which Bryant was known to frequent, on Monday. Nunes, a job trainer with the Rehabilitation Institute of Southern California, said he used to see Bryant at the store every few weeks. Nunes was quick to whip out his phone to show some of the pictures he’d taken with Bryant over the years, including one he said was from shortly after the Lakers’ last championship in 2010.
 “He was always cool with me,” he said. “He was always friendly. He signed a couple basketballs here and there.”
 Michael Young, 40, said he also saw Bryant periodically during the three years he’s worked as a courtesy clerk at the grocery store. When he heard the news about Bryant’s death, Young said his first reaction was tears.
 “He brought a lot of good energy … a lot of positive energy, a lot of good stuff for the community,” Nunes said.
 Both Young and Nunes said the shock of seeing the superstar in the flesh never completely wore off, no matter how many times he came to the grocery store or made a run to the Starbucks in the same shopping complex.
 “It’s like he’s still here,” Young said. “His spirit is all around us.”

Superb goaltending by senior Garret Bonello led the Wayzata High boys hockey team to two Lake Conference wins last week, and with those victories the Trojans improved to 12-6-1 overall.
 Thursday, Jan. 23, the Trojans knocked off the No. 1-ranked team in Class AA, Eden Prairie 2-1. And two days later, the Trojans won a 3-2 overtime thriller over Minnetonka. Those results tightened the Lake race. Eden Prairie (3-1-0) is still in the lead, but Edina (2-1-1), Minnetonka (4-2-0) and Wayzata (4-3-0) are still in the running for the title.
 Wayzata head coach Pat O’Leary talked about beating Eden Prairie.
 “It was one of those deals,” he said. “Obviously, we were ready and we were able to stay out of the penalty box, which is one of the keys to beating a team like Eden Prairie.”
 The idea was to keep Eden Prairie’s power play off the ice, and the Trojans only took four penalties, while Bonello stopped 29 of 30 in goal.
 Wayzata scored both of its goals in the second period. Dylan Lewis scored on assists from Hayden Davison and Jake Schneider, and then Drew Streeter scored from Kohl Sauer and Drew Goetz.
 Eden Prairie has a lot of top-end talent, led by senior forwards John Mittelstadt and Ben Steeves, but the Trojans showed they may have even more depth than the Eagles.
 “We are pretty balanced,” O’Leary said. “And we are able to use four lines.”
 At Minnetonka Saturday, the Trojans played their seventh overtime game of the season. They won for the fourth time against two losses and one tie.
 Wayzata took the lead in the second period. Ben Luedtke scored from Gavin O’Connell and Streeter to make it 1-0, and then Jack Kimlinger scored with assists from Charlie Podiak and Tucker Ness.
 Minnetonka battled back with third-period goals by Nic Henry and captain Teddy Lagerback to set up overtime.
 Kyle Mortenson’s unassisted goal ended the contest.
 Bonello stopped 28 of 30 shots, while Minnetonka goalie Brandon Shantz also had a quality performance, stopping 28 of 31.
 Wayzata will take a trip up north this weekend. The Trojans will face off against Greenway of Coleraine at 7 p.m. Friday, Jan. 31, at Hodgins Berado Arena. At 2:30 p.m. Saturday, Feb. 1, Wayzata will play in Grand Rapids.
 “The northern teams are physical,” O’Leary said. “Our schedule prepares us to play physical opponents.”
 Commenting on Bonello’s play throughout the season, O’Leary said. “Garret has been our rock. He has had good numbers and doesn’t give up a lot of rebounds.”

 “Because of its proximity to the ground, I knew something was wrong. It was hovering real low, like they were searching to land. It was making a slow left turn. It was about 9:44 a.m., and then the impact happened. I heard a crunch. I don’t think it pancaked. I think it hit rotors first,” Daehlin said. “I immediately called 911.”

 On Monday morning, the L.A. County coroner’s special response team was working on a ridge above the crash site, continuing to remove the remains of the nine victims with the help of search and rescue team members.
 Experts have said weather conditions and possible mechanical issues will likely be at the top of the list for investigators.
 The fog was severe enough Sunday morning that the Los Angeles Police Department’s Air Support Division grounded its helicopters and didn’t fly until later in the afternoon, department spokesman Josh Rubenstein said.
 “The weather situation did not meet our minimum standards for flying,” Rubenstein said. The fog “was enough that we were not flying.” LAPD’s flight minimums are 2 miles of visibility and an 800-foot cloud ceiling, he said.
 The L.A. County Sheriff’s Department made a similar assessment about the fog and had no helicopters in the air Sunday morning “basically because of the weather,” L.A. County Sheriff Alex Villanueva said.
 Witnesses said they heard a roar before the chopper slammed into the hillside Sunday morning.

As far as the growth in the minerals segment, I think that every year, it's going to grow and grow and grow. So I would think that it would be higher than 20%, five years from now. We'll just have to see what the market opportunities will bring. We're not going to grow for growth sake. We have never done that. We're not going to do it now, but we are hopeful that there will be opportunities to make transactions with folks that are long term in nature, that we can partner with and/or just people that will sell at reasonable prices. I think that's our challenge always as we'll try to be the people, what their expectations are for parting with their assets. That's always been the case in the coal space. And right now, that's sort of the view in the mineral space that there've been several mineral opportunities that have been trying to -- there are several other people that own minerals and tried to sell those or go public in the fourth quarter of last year that weren't successful. And there is only one reason for that. That's because they were asking too much. Their assets are good quality, they just haven't faced the reality as to what the market will pay for them.

I think that's where the depth and breadth of the market is at this 10-second split. Will it improve again to where we would be able to do that on an unsecured basis, time will tell.

Launched in 1931, Savarona was built for American heiress Emily Roebling Cadwallader. The yacht was eventually acquired by Turkey to be the presidential yacht of Kemal Atatürk, founder of modern Turkey. Jane’s Fighting Ships described the yacht in 1949 as “probably the most sumptuously fitted yacht afloat”. Savarona was later converted to a training ship for the Turkish Navy and, in 1978, destroyed by fire. The yacht laid in tatters for 10 years. A Turkish businessman spent around $45 million refurbishing Savarona, commissioning Donald Starkey for the interior and replacing the original steam-turbine engines with modern Caterpillar diesels. The yacht’s interior was refitted again in 2013, once again becoming the official presidential yacht in 2014. Savarona features a swimming pool, Turkish bath, 280-foot grand staircase, a movie theater, and a library dedicated to Atatürk.

Impeachment, he said, “is hell.” A measure of “last resort.” A bad habit to be kicked.
 With that, Ken Starr, the man whose years-long probe led to the impeachment of the 42nd president, stood before senators on Monday and delivered a nearly hour-long argument against the ouster of the 45th.
 Starr, with a nod to his own role in the impeachment of Bill Clinton and lofty talk about “America’s constitutional DNA,” argued that it’s time to bring an end to “the age of impeachment.”
 Starr spoke to the senators in a modulated tone, flicking at the Pentagon Papers, Richard Nixon’s crimes, the Iran-Contra scandal and, yes, the Clinton impeachment in a presentation that had echoes of a preacher extolling the virtues of moderation and expressing anguish that impeachment has become weaponized.

There’s no denying that Kobe Bryant left his mark on the basketball world. A number of NBA teams held a moment of silence before tip-off yesterday to honor the life and legacy of Bryant.
 Bryant is a 5x champion, 18-time All-Star, and his list of accomplishments both on and off the court are lengthy.
 Bryant did have some off-court controversy. He was accused of sexual assault in Colorado in 2003 before the criminal case was dropped the next year.
 In 2017, Bryant retired his jersey at the Staples Center in Anaheim, discussing the importance of hard work.
