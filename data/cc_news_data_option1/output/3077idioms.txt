Like far too many scholars, Rakove exaggerates the influence of Thomas Jefferson and James Madison. Indeed, his introduction is titled "The View from Monticello and Montpelier," his chapter on the founding era is called "The Revolutionary Legacy: Jefferson's and Madison's Great Project," and his final section is "Madison's Razor." He occasionally concedes that Jefferson and Madison are not "the sole or supreme representatives of the best American thinking on religious liberty," but these qualifications are too few and far between.

If you're not familiar with this technology, it's quite easy to understand. Some companies sell games, while others sell the hardware needed to run these games. Cloud gaming technology not only removes the need for top-tier hardware but also lets you play games on the go (and we're not talking about mobile games).      Google Stadia and NVIDIA GeForce NOW offer the same service but in a slightly different manner. The former gives subscribers access to a very limited catalog of games and allows them to play these titles on PC and compatible Android phones. You'll have to own these games before you can play them over cloud, or you can pay for a Premium subscription and receive access to one or two games per month.

Samsung still gave the Note 20 Ultra an 108-megapixel camera option -- you tap it to turn it on when you want the full resolution. When it comes to zoom, the Note 20 falls back to 50x zoom, with the Note 20 settling in at 30x.
 It's interesting to see Samsung backtrack like this, but the company seems to be responding to feedback that the S20 Ultra was too expensive and its 100x zoom wasn't good enough or useful enough to justify the price.
 The Note 20 Ultra has 5x optical zoom, which should make photos taken in that range crisper and clearer than using digital zoom alone. We'll soon see.
 Faster autofocus in the Note 20 Ultra is also designed to give it an edge over the standard Note 20, so you can snap photos of squirmy pets, amusing facial expressions and flapping hummingbirds faster, without missing the shot.
 A pro video mode packs in more manual tools and options for capturing footage, which should make aspiring moviemakers happy. This has been one of Samsung's weaker areas for several years, compared to the latest iPhone. As with the Galaxy S20 Ultra, both phones support 8K video capture. Just be aware, it'll make video files enormous on and off your phone.

The listing has also revealed that the phone will run Android 10 and offer 6GB of RAM. Per an earlier report, at least one model will come with 128GB of native memory.
    Previously, the device was seen on the Google Play Console, and according to that listing, the LG Q92 will feature a 1080p display, which should be nearly the same size as Velvet's 6.8-inch screen.
    Since this device is expected to be a true mid-tier phone, it will likely swap out Velvet's OLED panel for an LCD screen. Similarly, it will probably come with an inferior camera setup. For reference, the Velvet boasts a triple camera system with a 48MP primary sensor, an 8MP ultrawide unit, and a 5MP depth module.
    The selfie camera is 16MP and interestingly, it's housed in a notch. The LG Q92, on the other hand, might feature a pinhole screen.
    Color options will supposedly include Green, Red, White, Black, and Teal.
   
 ## Will the LG Q92 come to the US?
    It's not known if the affordable mid-ranger will be launched in the US and Europe, or if it's only meant for the company's home country of South Korea.
    If it does come to the US, it will obviously cost less than the LG Velvet, which retails for $599. It will duke it out with the Samsung Galaxy A51 5G, which will go on sale in the country on Friday with a price of $499.99.
    The Galaxy A51 5G is also currently the most affordable carrier-locked 5G handset in the country and it will be interesting to see if the LG Q92 will take that crown.

 Fußballer können zukünftig auch wegen absichtlichen Hustens in Richtung der Schiedsrichter oder der anderen Spielern des Feldes verwiesen worden. Das beschlossen die Regelhüter des International Football Association Board (Ifab). Die neue Richtlinie wurde zum Schutz vor dem Coronavirus in das Regelwerk aufgenommen. Jede Bestrafung liegt aber im Ermessen des Schiedsrichters. Bei zufälligem Husten oder bei einem großen Abstand zwischen den Spielern solle der Schiedsrichter keine Maßnahmen ergreifen, heißt es weiter. Es müsse eine eindeutige Handlung vorliegen.

Styling is also a big part of building a collection with a client. At the end of the day, we’re looking for something that the client is going to love and wear, not keep in a safe. So, if it’s a new client, we identify what her personal style is so I can come to her with an assortment that we both love. Before we meet, I’ll ask her questions like whether she prefers yellow or white gold, and find out things like whether she only wears rings and bracelets and not necklaces. Does she like statement pieces or more delicate? Does she like to layer? Once we nail all of that down, it becomes second nature for me to regularly have pieces on hand to offer her.

Unrelated to the pandemic and the ramifications from it, music streaming services were already causing major changes to how the music industry operated. Album sales were down across the board, but live concerts were becoming more popular over the past decade. And now that the pandemic has halted live events, music streaming platforms need to innovate. According to a report by Deloitte Insights, "Some music platforms are innovating by hosting virtual concerts for artists. While it may be impossible to re-create the concert experience in a living room, many digital platforms are bringing artists closer to fans. Tidal, for example, is offering consumers free access to virtual concerts as part of its "At Home with Tidal" program."

It was frustrating to see the bonding bill fall short again in the legislature’s second special session. This bill included funding to complete the Blazing Star Trail segment between Albert Lea and Hayward. For over 20 years, this district has been asking the state for a pedestrian and bike trail that would connect Albert Lea to Austin with more than 20 miles of beautiful prairie to enjoy. This would boost our service, tourist and retail economy.

La ripresa del mercato passerà dalla consulenza specializzata. Ma il presente è ancora debole, se ne riparlerà nel 2021. “L'anno prossimo pensiamo di crescere e potremmo aggiungere fino a 50 nuovi personal voyager rispetto ai 120 di oggi, presi tra gli affiliati a Gattinoni che sceglieranno la nostra formula” ha detto a TTG Italia Ezio Barroero (nella foto), presidente di Lab Travel Group, in riferimento ai nuovi tipi di contratto che il network proporrà ai suoi agenti, basato su una collaborazione che privilegia la consulenza al cliente a domicilio o in apposite filiali, ma senza più i costi del negozio su strada. “Una proposta - specifica Barroero - rivolta a figure già esperte”. Quanto alla stagione in corso, non si fa mistero delle difficoltà, ma resta la fiducia. “I volumi sono bassi, il lungo raggio ancora inesistente a parte qualcosa per l'ultimo trimestre - conclude il presidente -. Ma i nostri agenti non si sono demotivati e hanno mostrato flessibilità, imparando a vendere di tutto, dai viaggi in camper alle locazioni in montagna”.
