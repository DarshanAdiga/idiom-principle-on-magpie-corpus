Without the ticket sales cash flow, which makes up 60% of UC Theatre’s revenue, the nonprofit organization is struggling, Mayeri said. It’s not only future performances at risk. There are 75 people on the payroll who are now out of work. And one of UC Theatre’s main missions — to train young people from disadvantaged backgrounds in the nuts and bolts of the music business — from creating financial spreadsheets, to selling tickets, booking talent and running a show — is in peril. The shelter-in-place order has interrupted the venue's nine-month training program for 20 students, moved meetings to virtual hangouts, and deprived the students on hands-on training.

 Thomas Michael Cavaretta Thomas Michael Cavaretta, 59, beloved husband, father, son, brother and friend, found his place in Heaven on March 23, 2020. Tom was a graduate of Coronado High School in El Paso,Texas, earned his BBA in Marketing from the University of Texas at Austin and an MBA in Business from the University of Texas at El Paso. Tom married his high school sweetheart, Marcy Lynne Rettig and they moved to Tempe, Arizona where they raised two amazing sons, Joey Cavaretta and Nick Cavaretta. Tom was proud of his sons and spent countless hours with them, turning wood, fixing cars and making them laugh. Tom was an avid cyclist and the biggest goofball you ever knew (he actually referred to himself as a Termite). He never met a stranger. He loved spending time outdoors with his cycling friends. Tom enjoyed relaxing at his cabin, tying flies and fishing. He spent his indoor time in his garage working magic with wood. Tom was handy, a skilled craftsman, and was always helpful with projects in the garage or for friends, family and neighbors. Immediately after college, Tom started working in real estate, but he found his true calling in pharmaceutical sales, most recently as a Regional Sales Manager at Astellas Pharma. He had a beautiful smile, sparkling blue eyes and he could make everyone he talked to feel like they were the most important person in the room. He will be missed. Tom is survived by his wife, Marcy Rettig Cavaretta, sons Joey and Nicholas Cavaretta, mother Teresa Cavaretta, brother, Joseph Cavaretta, sisters Laura Cavaretta, Teresa (Ray) Luterbach, Ellyn (Don) Black, Mary (Chris) Dockens, and numerous nieces (Michelle Luterbach, Shilo Dockens, Sophia and Sienna Cavaretta, Anne Marie Rogers; and nephews (Ryan Luterbach, Tim and Tyler Black, Christopher Dockens), his mother-in-law Anne Rettig, sister-in-law Karen (Mark) Rogers. He is pre- deceased by his father, Charles Patrick Cavaretta, M.D. and his father-in-law A Ralph Rettig. Because of the current COVID-19 situation, private services for family only are planned. A celebration of Tom's life will be held at a later date. In lieu of flowers, please make donations in Tom's name to Bike Saviours 1930 S.

"We are continuing to work closely with the Walz Administration on urgent COVID-19 matters to protect the health and well-being of Minnesotans. We will publicly release details on specific legislation on the House and Senate websites as soon as we can," House Speaker Melissa Hortman, D-Brooklyn Park, and Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, R-East Gull Lake, said in a joint statement late Wednesday.
 One of the top tasks for legislators will be weighing a $356 million supplemental budget request that Gov. Tim Walz put forward earlier this week. The proposal creates a $200 million COVID-19 response fund, boosts support to child care providers, food banks, homeless shelters and state funding for low- income individuals, the elderly and those with disabilities.
 The plan would help fund motel beds for homeless individuals exposed to COVID-19 or with symptoms of respiratory illness. It would also give a $9 million boost for regional food banks and 400 food shelves around the state. The funding would also help pay to transport food around the state to elderly, disabled and quarantined Minnesotans.
 Lawmakers will also take up some of the top issues raised by people around the state who've lost work, got sick, had to stay home with kids or otherwise adjust their lives as COVID-19, the sickness stemmed by the coronavirus, spread. and they'll decide whether to extend the governor's authority in a peacetime emergency.
 Since the first case of COVID-19 was reported in the state earlier this month, Walz limited social gatherings, shuttered restaurants, bars and other social activities along with Minnesota schools to limit the disease's spread. And Wednesday, the governor announced he would ask Minnesotans to stay at home unless working in critical fields or completing certain tasks or activities.
