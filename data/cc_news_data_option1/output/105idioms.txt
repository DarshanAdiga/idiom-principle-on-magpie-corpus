"The biggest motivation for me is becoming a three-division world champion faster than any other boxer, male or female," said Shields in an interview with CBS Local's DJ Sixsmith. "Regardless of what she [Ivana Habazin] says, her actions have to show it. She can say whatever. I think it's sad that she's using her coach's incident in Flint in order to make herself bigger. That's kind of insensitive to me. She keeps bringing it up in every interview. At the end of the day, I am the cash cow in women's boxing. Ivana is being paid more than she's ever been paid for a fight, but she's just another opponent. I'm the greatest woman of all-time."

Sinclair made only seven appearances for Celtic’s first team this season.


  But in his previous three campaigns he had been a regular fixture in the side.


  Brendan Rodgers, who had managed him at Swansea, took him to Glasgow in August 2016.


  Trophy after trophy came their way, Sinclair netting 62 goals for them in all competitions.


  “I think it was the best part of my career, we were winning everything up there,” said Sinclair.


  “Celtic won the treble-treble, I was voted player of the year and sports writers’ player of year.


  “Brendan Rodgers left, there were a few changes and Lenny (Neil Lennon) came in.


  “He is doing a great job and I’m sure they will get nine in a row.


  “For me it is time to kick on and bring my form here to Preston, try to hit the ground running.


  “It is a fresh start and a new chapter, a chance to play football and enjoy it again.


  “I’ve played in the Championship before and know what it is about. It is relentless with so many games in the season.


  “We’ve got some great players here and we need to keep pushing forward as a club.


  “I’m on board to try and help the team push on.”


  The timescale of the deal being done was slightly longer than it might have been, purely due to Celtic jetting off to Dubai for a training camp during the winter shutdown in Scotland.


  Sinclair trained while the deal was put together back in the UK.


  Then came the call to fly home and get the move over the line.


  “There were worse places to be than Dubai while it was all going on,” said Sinclair with a smile.


  “I knew there was a good chance that I would get a phone call to fly back at some point.


  “That call came and it was a case of getting on the flight back.”


  Sinclair trained for the first time with his Preston team-mates on Thursday morning. As long as international clearance comes through, he can expect to make his debut against Blackburn.


  Whether that be from the start or as a substitute, North End manager Alex Neil would not reveal.


  In the main he played on the left-hand side of the attack at Celtic, cutting inside on to his right foot.


  That is something Callum Robinson used to do at PNE before his move to Sheffield United.


  It has taken until now to properly replace him and Sinclair is certainly a player along the same lines as Robinson.


  He can play centrally too, something he did on occasions for Celtic.


  Neil thinks he can play right across the front, that versatility something he likes in his forwards.


  Away from the pitch, Sinclair’s partner is a well-known face on television.


  For many years, Helen Flanagan walked the cobbles of Coronation Street as Rosie Webster.


  The couple have two daughters and they will be looking to settle back in the North West.

Plus size women often have limited selections in term of fashion. Not just in style or silhouette, but also in brand. Many plus size women will see elaborate designs or beautiful gowns on the red carpet; however, the accessibility of the clothes are next to none. Even for powerhouse celebs like Lizzo, if they wear a piece like Valentino or Gucci, it is always custom made. Fashion and their fight against fat women have been a bit of smoke and mirrors. You will see diversity in the runway, but not in stores. Commitment to making fashion accessible to all, but it's only mumus, kaftans, ruffles, and flowers. Well, Carolina Herrera is making a stand on the side of inclusion and is now offering clothing for plus size women via 11 Honoré.

Up to 250 jobs are set to be axed at a factory making trains in County Durham.

 The firm said a consultation with staff was under way, and it was working with the union and local business groups.

 Posted by Spring Valley Police Department on Wednesday, January 8, 2020


  A Facebook post by the Spring Valley Police reports they arrived on a scene of chaos.


  NBC New York 4 reported that the loose dog went after a one-year-old boy and bit down on his winter jacket. His sister tried to pull her brother away and several good Samaritans tried to physically remove the dog from the child.


  A 29-year-old bystander who tried to help the children by kicking the dog was then bitten by the animal, causing significant injury to his arm, reports ABC 7 NY. The man was sent to the hospital for surgery.


  According to Fox News, Moshe Lefkovits, a volunteer with the emergency services organization Chaverim of Rockland, rushed in to aid the siblings along with 20 other volunteers. Lefkovits cut the baby’s coat and removed the children from the dog, who was finally restrained and contained.


  The baby had a couple of bruises, but the siblings escaped with no dog bites. All three victims were transported to local hospitals by Hatzolah ambulance.
