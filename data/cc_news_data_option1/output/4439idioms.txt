David Silva scored his first goal for Real Sociedad on Sunday to help them go back to the top of La Liga after a 4-1 win over Celta Vigo.


  Silva headed La Real in front at Balaidos for his first goal since he left Manchester City in the summer, and his first in La Liga since he departed Valencia 11 years ago.


  Mikel Oyarzabal made it two with his fifth of the season, a tally that also makes him the league's top scorer so far.


  Willian Jose then hit the net twice in the second half, either side of Iago Aspas converting a penalty, which gave Celta brief hope of a comeback.


  Celta's Jose Fontan was sent off for a second yellow card late on, to cap a disappointing afternoon for the home side, who sit 17th, without a win in six games.


  But another impressive victory for Real Sociedad means they have won their last four league games on the bounce, with scorelines of 3-0, 3-0, 4-1 and 4-1.


  They return to the top of the table, one point ahead Real Madrid, who had temporarily taken first place after their 4-1 win over Huesca on Saturday.


  Atletico Madrid are third, three points off the leaders but with two games in hand.


  Valencia, meanwhile, avoided a fourth straight defeat by drawing 2-2 at home to Getafe but could easily have lost or won the game after a wild finish at Mestalla.


  Leading 1-0 through a goal from Yunus Musah, Valencia were reduced to 10 men when Thierry Correia was sent off just before the hour.


  They conceded in the 87th minute when Juan Camilo Hernadez equalised for Getafe, who then looked to have snatched a victory when Angel scored again in the 94th minute.


  But Valencia hit back in the 10th minute of injury-time, Carlos Soler converting a penaly to ensure they at least went away with a point. Getafe's Damian Suarez was also shown a red card in the 98th minute to add to the mayhem.


  Getafe slip to eighth while Valencia stay 13th.


  Real Betis had earlier beaten Elche 3-1 to climb to seventh. Elche drop to 10th.

HOLLYWOOD, S.C. (AP) — Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham and Democratic candidate Jaime Harrison crisscrossed South Carolina on closing- argument bus tours this weekend, the incumbent pointing to his ability to get things done for constituents and the challenger arguing that change is needed in the Senate to benefit the state. Graham \"was a senator that I had some respect for, because I thought, at the end of the day, he would do what was in the best interest of the nation and the people of South Carolina,” Harrison said Sunday as he campaigned. “But I was disappointed. I think many of you were disappointed as well.” Graham, who has won his previous general election contests by double-digit margins, admits the race with Harrison has been more challenging than he expected. On Saturday, Harrison made stops in northwestern South Carolina, a heavily Republican area. Graham stumped in the Republican stronghold of Horry County, where 67% of votes cast went for Donald Trump in 2016. “You know what I’ve got going for me? You,” Graham told supporters Saturday, saying the area represented a ”red wave” of GOP support. On Sunday, Graham planned to campaign along the state’s coast, while Harrison was in the Charleston County town of Hollywood, which is 59% Black and in a county that Hillary Clinton won by about 8 percentage points in 2016. More than 1 million people had already cast their ballots in a race that drew sums of money unheard of in South Carolina politics. In October, Harrison became the first- ever U.S. Senate candidate to raise more than $100 million, continuing to bring in contributions in the weeks since. On Saturday, Graham told The Associated Press that he had “passed the $100 million” mark in terms of his own fundraising, chuckling in disbelief both at the monetary demand his race had...

But it was an incredibly long 500-lap points-chasing quest at NASCAR's oldest and smallest speedway. Harvick was racing for the fourth and final slot in the field, separated from Denny Hamlin and Brad Keselowski by one point on one lap, two on the next, back to one after that.


  The three drivers were locked into a tense fight for single digit points because with Elliott out front, it left just two spots for three drivers.


  Harvick was one point below the cutline when Elliott crossed the finish line. He needed to pass one car ahead of him -- Kyle Busch, Hamlin's teammate at Joe Gibbs Racing -- to grab that point and Busch wasn't going to make it easy.


  Harvick tried to knock Busch out of his way in a failed desperate effort as they closed in on the finish line. Both cars spun and Harvick's season was done.


  "It was just a move I had to try knowing that I needed one point," Harvick said. "It was just a Hail Mary that didn't work out."


  Elliott, Keselowski and Hamlin will race Joey Logano, who had already clinched his berth, in next week's finale at Phoenix. It's a matchup of a pair of Fords from Team Penske against Hamlin's Toyota and Elliott, the first Hendrick Motorsports and Chevrolet driver to make the finale since Jimmie Johnson won his seventh and final title in 2016.


  Hamlin, a seven-time winner this season who went race-for-race with Harvick all year, lamented not getting a shot at his rival in Phoenix.


  "I feel bad for Kevin. I think they deserve to be in. They have nine wins. There's not a person on this planet that would say they aren't a top-four team," Hamlin said. "We wanted to create a Game 7 moment, so this is what you get.


  "If you have a bad race or two in a three-race series, you're out. Everything you do for eight innings doesn't matter if you don't have a good ninth inning."


  Harvick was eliminated along with Alex Bowman, Kurt Busch and Martin Truex Jr., who battled for the win until a late loose wheel ended his shot.


  Elliott, meanwhile, scored a must-win victory that put him in the finale after three previous failures to advance. It's a huge professional on-track accomplishment for NASCAR's most popular driver and gave the beloved Elliott family its first Martinsville trophy grandfather clock.


  Bill Elliott was 0 for 45 at Martinsville in his Hall of Fame career, and Chase Elliott won in his 11th try.


  "It's the biggest win ever for us," said Elliott, who earned his 10th Cup victory and career-high fourth of the season. "I've never been in this position before and it's exiting."


  NASCAR this season moved Martinsville to the final elimination race in an effort to turn the .0526-mile paperclip into a short track throw-down. It made for 500 white-knuckled laps in which the contenders all showed up to win but also had in-race bobbles.


  Elliott had back-to-back bad pit stops, including one late in the race in which Elliott could have drawn a race-crippling penalty when his jackman entered the service stall too early. The crew member smartly ran back to pit wall and touched it to re-establish his position, leading NASCAR to make a no- call on the slip.


  Keselowski was flagged for speeding on pit road, Hamlin was hampered by loose lug nuts during a stop, Truex had a loose wheel Harvick's flat tire deflated his season.

This is not very hard to prove if you approach the question with a critical eye instead of engaging in breast-beating about how great U.S. democracy is by virtue of the simple fact that we enjoy basic civil liberties and civil rights, which are the very basic elements of even the most rudimentary form of democracy. You can start by looking at the distribution of economic and political power. That is the most direct and obvious way to figure out whether a society functions democratically or is controlled by a power elite. The U.S. is one of the richest countries in the world, but also one with extreme levels of inequality. The richest 1 percent own 40 percent of the country's wealth, according to a study produced a few years ago by economist Edward N. Wolff. By the same token, the top 1 percent incomes have grown in recent years to be five times as much as the bottom 90 percent incomes. Economic power, of course, translates almost automatically into political power. This does not mean that the capitalist state is by extension a mere tool in the hands of the capitalist class, as crude Marxism used to contend back in the era of the Comintern, but the government agenda is heavily influenced, if not outright shaped, by economic elite domination.

While city dwellers are typically able to get to their polling place by public transit or on foot, this is less possible for those in rural and suburban areas. And in those areas, the people who don’t own cars are by and large the ones most severely affected by the government’s political decisions: low-income Americans, who are disproportionately Black, Latinx, Indigenous, immigrants, or LGBTQ. The elderly and people with disabilities, who often have physical barriers to driving, and young people, who are less likely to own a car than older generations, also struggle to vote for this reason, advocates told BuzzFeed News.


  For at least the past several years, activist groups and rideshare companies have helped alleviate this issue by offering free or discounted rides to the polls. This year, Uber, Lyft, and even the scooter sharing company Lime are offering deals to help get voters where they need to go.


  But that will not be possible this year for Michigan residents, where a decades-old law makes it illegal to provide paid transportation for voters unless they are “physically unable to walk.”


  In January, liberal super PAC Priorities USA filed a lawsuit seeking to overturn the state law, which allows for volunteers to drive voters to the polls, but prevents companies such as Uber and Lyft from offering discounts on rides there as they do in the rest of the country. Last month, a judge ruled to uphold the law.


  Aneesa McMillan, a spokesperson for Priorities USA, told BuzzFeed News that she expects transportation issues to continue to be a major voting barrier this year. “With such robust voter suppression across the country, which is spearheaded by the RNC and the Trump campaign, it makes transportation all the more important because of the national efforts to limit and restrict access to the ballot,” McMillan said.

  LONDON, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Gareth Bale came off the bench to head the winner for Tottenham Hotspur in a 2-1 victory over Brighton & Hove Albion in the Premier League on Sunday, his first goal since returning to the club from Real Madrid.


  The Welshman was brought on in the 70th minute and three minutes later he met a Sergio Reguilon cross with a firm and well-directed header to restore Tottenham's lead.


  Harry Kane had put Spurs ahead in the 13th minute from the penalty spot after Adam Lallana was ruled to have fouled him as he climbed for a header.


  Brighton responded with a long spell of good possession football as Spurs failed to drive home their advantage and Graham Potter's side drew level in the 56th minute.


  Tariq Lamptey drove into the far, bottom corner after being set up by Pascal Gross at the end of a clever move from Brighton but the VAR official asked referee Graham Scott to look at a challenge on Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg by Solly March.


  Spurs felt that Marsh had fouled the Dane but Scott ruled the challenge was fair and the goal stood.


  Tottenham then struck the post twice, firstly a drive from the edge of the box from Erik Lamela and then a close-range effort from a tight angle by Kane.


  Then came Bale's winner as Spurs moved above Everton in the standings into second place on 14 points, two behind leaders Liverpool.


  Bale has yet to start in the Premier League for Spurs as he works his way back to full match fitness and was delighted to have got off the mark.


  "It's a great feeling. You just want to come on and do a job for the team. I worked for the team and was lucky enough to get the goal," he said.


  But Bale was wary of the suggestion that Spurs could be in a position to compete for the title this season.


  "(We are) very competitive, we know not to get too carried away. There are some great teams, we are just going to keep working as hard as we can," he said.

Cole's spokesperson, Andre Treiber told BuzzFeed News that hers was one of three scheduled events that the Texas Democrats canceled on Friday for "safety and security reasons," including an event in San Marcos and another at the AFL-CIO in Austin.


  Treiber said that while there wasn't a direct threat to any of the events, the decision to cancel them was because "tensions were rising and things were getting heated."


  "When you're going to have a lot of people at rallies and events.... we have to keep the people safe," Treiber said.


  He said the "Trump protesters" had been following the Biden bus all along the highway.


  "As long as you're doing it safely and legally, there's nothing wrong with protesting," Treiber said. But then, the Trump vehicle collided with a car that belonged to the Biden caravan, he said, adding that it was hard to tell whether it was an accident or "something intentional."


  In a bizarre statement responding to the incident, the Texas GOP chairman Allen West called the incident "fake news and propaganda" and urged reporters to "prepare to lose."


  The Texas GOP said that a Texas Tribune reporter who reached out to them for a comment was trying to "portray conservatives as violent radicals, even though it is leftists from Antifa and BLM who have been assaulting, robbing, and looting fellow citizens and their property."


  In his statement, West attacked the media for not being concerned about "real violence," referring to the deaths of three Trump supporters and falsely claiming that a "leftist mob" attempted to storm and burn down the house of the McCloskeys — a St. Louis couple indicted on felony charges after they waved their guns at Black Lives Matter protesters on their street.


  "Prepare to lose…stop bothering me. Maybe Soros can cut y’all another check in 2022," West said.

For the first time during the pandemic, Drew Miller was unable to send a severely ill COVID patient to the intensive care unit.


   


  Miller and other staff at the Kearny County Hospital, in southwestern Kansas, had done what they could last weekend, putting the patient on a maximum oxygen flow. But the closest ICU in the area was one county over -- St. Catherine Hospital in Garden City -- and it was full. The nearest open ICU bed was in Kansas City, seven hours away.


   


  By the time an ICU bed opened up at St. Catherine, the patient needed to be intubated and was in much worse condition.


   


  The experience was "uncomfortable. And unwanted," said Miller, who is the hospital's chief of staff and the county's lead medical officer.


   


  It brought home a reality that many in western Kansas have been trying to avoid: The coronavirus is here, it is getting worse and it will put a strain on a rural health care system that is already sparse and understaffed.


   


  Overall, Kansas has more than 85,000 cases. And as of Friday, five rural Kansas counties were among the top 20 U.S. counties with the highest number of COVID-19 cases per resident, according to The New York Times.


   


  Kearny County is not one of them. It had opted out of the state's mask mandate, as permitted this summer. But on Oct. 14, the county began requiring masks in public spaces and limiting mass gatherings to 25% occupancy.


   


  As of Friday, the county has seen 160 COVID-19 cases over the course of the pandemic, 58 of them diagnosed in October. It's currently at Level 4, the highest level on a county-created rubric of pandemic severity, indicating a rapidly increasing number of people are testing positive for COVID-19 and seeking medical treatment.


   


  Even so, Miller said, it's been hard to convey the growing threat of the virus, especially with such widespread misinformation.


   


  "Our county health voice has just been drowned out," Miller said. "It's hard to get people to wear a mask when they don't feel it, when they don't see what we see every day, which is more sick people and more severe cases."


   


  Absence of mask mandates


   


  In nearby Finney County, positivity rates for the coronavirus reached 31% between Oct. 12-16. As of Friday, there had been 2,766 cases in the county, 700 of them reported since Sept. 30.


   


  The virus is spreading widely throughout the community, Finney County Health Department Director Colleen Drees said.


   


  "I wouldn't say that there's any specific outbreaks that are causing it," Drees said. "We've had several people that have reported that they're not sure where they contracted COVID because they're unsure of who near them was sick."


   


  Earlier this year, Finney, Ford and Seward counties -- home to four meatpacking plants and 25% of the nation's beef processing -- saw a massive spike in cases. According to state data, 21 clusters have been linked to meatpacking plants, as well as more than 3,600 cases, 113 hospitalizations and 19 deaths. Unlike in other places, the plants in western Kansas did not close.


   


  Dr. R.C. Trotter, an advisor for Ford County, said its numbers (3,491 as of Oct. 30) are no longer as concerning. To his knowledge, the county does not track current moving averages of positivity rates or case numbers, which are common measures for COVID severity.


   


  Ford County does not have a mask order, but Trotter said he sees most people wearing masks in public places, and many indoor gatherings have been canceled. He called the question of a mandate "political."


   


  "I sit on the fence, I'll be honest," he said. "Is it worth it for me to go out and fall on the sword, which quite honestly, a lot of public health officers are? We're seeing the rebuttal for that."


   


  While other health officials have warned for months that the fall and winter would bring a rise in cases -- which appears to be happening across a large swath of the country -- Trotter said he doesn't think there's any scientific evidence that the colder weather increases cases.


   


  "It's conjecture. We don't know," he said.


   


  Officials in the Finney County government and in Garden City, the largest city and county seat, have yet to issue any orders relating to coronavirus precautions, such as a mask mandate, gathering ban or social distancing rules. Leaders opted out of Gov. Laura Kelly's statewide mask mandate in the summer.


   


  The county's medical director has asked the county and city governments for a mask order through the summer and fall.


   


  The county commission meets next on Monday, Nov. 2. Commissioner Dave Jones said COVID would likely be on the agenda, but he wasn't sure whether a mask order would be. Jones also said he was concerned a mask mandate would be too overbearing on local schools and preferred to let the districts make that decision.


   


  Finney County Commissioner Duane Drees supports mask wearing, social distancing and other recommendations of doctors, but said he doesn't feel a mandate is necessary or even enforceable.


   


  "There is a limit to what common sense and the public will tolerate," he said. "You don't need a law to protect people from their own self. That's why God gave us common sense."


   


  Drees said social distancing and gathering limits also would be hard to enforce, especially in a county with such a large population of people from different ethnicities.


   


  "African cultures, Asian cultures, Hispanic. Family unit is very important to most of these cultures," he said. "And they tend to get together as a family unit more than the traditional resident."


   


  Families who have been in the area for "100 years," Drees continued, "we tend to have assimilated much more and drifted away from the family orientation."


   


  He believes it's harder to tell recent immigrants to follow social distancing rules.


   


  "Are they going to pay attention? I doubt it," Drees said.


   


  Garden City Manager Matt Allen said the municipal government decided at the beginning of the pandemic to defer to the county government for a unified message.


   


  While a mask mandate is tentatively on the agenda for the city's Nov. 3 meeting, he said it was unclear whether the city would decide to depart from the county.


   


  'We are desperate'


   


  Finney County Medical Director, Dr. Lindsay Byrnes, said she often observes people going unmasked in public spaces. When she went to the county administration building to vote this week, only one poll worker was wearing a mask, she said. Most government employees were not.


   


  "I think our leadership failed to take a strong stance and encourage it," she said.


   


  She pushed for a mask mandate through the summer and fall. It's the best way, she said, to ensure county residents comply with health precautions during a critical time.


   


  A recently published study from the University of Kansas shows counties with mask mandates decreased their seven-day rolling averages of daily cases per 100,000 people, while counties without mandates have seen those averages increase.


   


  "We are desperate to explain that this must be a community-wide effort," Byrnes said. "It cannot be only the burden of the health care system. It cannot be the burden of a few, it has to be everyone working in concert."


   


  Byrnes said school teachers and hospital staff in the county have had to stay home from work because they've caught the virus out in the community, not at their workplaces. That indicates that the virus is widespread and that schools and hospitals may be incapacitated just when the community needs them, she said.


   


  St. Catherine Hospital in Garden City only has eight ICU beds. Patients in serious condition are sometimes transferred to facilities in Wichita, Denver or other large cities within a few hours' flight, Byrnes said.

Carson   GLENN BROWER CARSON   September 2, 1941 October 25, 2020   Glenn was born on September 2, 1941 at Peck Memorial Hospital in Brooklyn, New York to Bartley Rhodes and Muriel Hedwig Sofia (Rolff) Morgan. Not much more is known about her early childhood, other than she quit taking naps at five months and her mother had to tie a string around her to take her own naps. When her father returned from his South American assignment at the end of WWII, he did so on a convalescence ship filled with tuberculosis patients. With a bleak prognosis, the family of four jumped in a surplus Willy's Jeep, christened "Maud", and drove to the Texas State Tuberculosis Sanitorium in San Angelo, Texas. Story goes that after three years of lying flat on his back, Rhodes sat up and declared it was time to go back to work. After his stint at Goodfellow AFB, Muriel proclaimed that she was tired of being a Damn Yankee. With Glenn's older brother in college, the three of them moved to the Black Forest in 1954 with Rhodes working at Fort Carson. The move allowed Glenn to find her first love, horses. That love nearly killed her when she was crushed under her horse when spooked on the trail. At the age of 14, she was told by doctors that her pelvis was so damaged that she would never walk again. Wrong. She graduated valedictorian from Air Academy High School in the second ever class of 1959. And after one year of study at Colorado State University, she traded her textbooks for an apron to raise two sons.   Newly divorced in 1967, she worked during the day as a law clerk and model while attending class at the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs in the evenings as her mother tended to two lively towheads, Ward and Morgan. Claiming to be the inspiration for John Denver's "Rocky Mountain High", she was truly "born in the summer of her 27th year". She earned a BA in Education in 1972 and taught fourth grade at Helen Keller Elementary in north Colorado Springs for the next two years. The perks of teaching gave her the ability to make the most of summers and winter breaks. She would be the first boat in most mornings at Prospect Lake, took camping trips around the state, and yearly road trips that included both Florida and California and most points in between. With an appetite for adventure, she moved her boys up to the Vail Valley in 1974 to teach second grade at Meadow Mountain Elementary. Her claim to fame in the valley was being the very first trailer hookup at the Eagle River Village Mobile Home Park in Edwards in November of 1974. She successfully passed her love for skiing to both of her boys; one found powder and the other competition. In typical Glenn fashion, she jumped in with both feet with Morgan's ski racing. She became a certified timer, but more importantly the surrogate mother to racers from Steamboat, Aspen, Breckenridge, and Ski Club Vail. EVERYONE knew Glenn.   While in Vail, she continued her courtship with Dr. John "Jack" Carson. He got tired of the long-distance dating and convinced her to marry in February of 1976. She would once again trade a career for an apron. While doting on her two boys, she went back to school and earned her Masters in Special Education in 1981. A near tragedy in 1984 would introduce her to the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo Auxiliary. Morgan had broken his neck at a racing camp and would take more than a year to fully recover. She answered a call for volunteers to observe Chimpanzee behavior in cooperation with the Jane Goodall Institute and it was true love. She found a passion that combined her love for animals and teaching. This love would follow her the rest of her life.   But let's not forget that appetite for adventure. With Jack as her partner in crime, they crossed the four corners of the globe in search of the new and wild. A safari in Africa would be followed by a dive trip to the Great Barrier Reef. A photo-safari of the Polar Bears of Manitoba here and the Castles of Croatia there. Golf was also a common theme. Longtime members at the Kissing Camels Club, lifelong friends were also made.   When Jack passed in 2016, Glenn focused her energies on the zoo and her newly adopted dog, Cisco. But always the social butterfly, she would have a chance meeting with Captain Jim Lauer at a local jazz bar. For the last three-plus years, these two continued the adventure. A Columbia River cruise and Tanzania safari were highlights.   Upon returning from Tanzania in October of 2019, Glenn suffered a slight stroke while taking her bag off the carousel. With the cause indeterminable, she went to her internist to determine the source of some mid-abdomen pain. It was then that four separate tumors were discovered as stage four pancreatic cancer. Undaunted by the gravity of the diagnosis, she began chemotherapy in November of 2019. While getting good results, the therapy proved too poisonous for her and she was given a chemo holiday in January. She would feel great through the summer but was unable to travel due to the Covid lock downs. She (and Jim) would concentrate their energies on the monumental task of downsizing from her Pinecliff estate to a townhouse in Kissing Camels. She was mostly successful, with the exception of covering all wall space in her new place with artwork and photographs. On October 5th, she received news that the second therapy had lost its effectiveness and it was time to coordinate home hospice. After only her second nurse visit on October 20th, she suffered a moderate stroke and became bedridden two days later. The stroke was a blessing, as she would die peacefully five days later without suffering the pains of her cancer. She waited for it to snow so she could fly with the snowflakes that Sunday morning.   Her bucket list: to ski and scuba dive, AGAIN. While we will miss her infectious smile, her eternal gift is the joy that she spread to all. She truly made the world around her a better place.   She is survived by her brother, Luckey Morgan; sons, Ward (PJ) Mahanke, Morgan (Melissa) Mahanke; stepdaughter, Dayna Carson (Mike) Wiederich; granddaughters, Cailin Mahanke and Cameron Mahanke; grandson, Carson Mahanke; and her loyal pooch, Cisco.   With the current health regulations, the family will postpone her Celebration of Life until further notice.   In her memory, simply pay it forward and/or donate to the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo or charity of your choice. Most of all, adopt her spirit to see the world in a positive light.

Greenup County is in “red” status, according to the Kentucky COVID map, as of Saturday.


  Greenup County Judge-Executive Robert Carpenter extended the closure of the old courthouse through Wednesday after hearing a recommendation from the Kentucky Department of Health. Voters may still vote by entering the fiscal court room from the outside on the detention-center side of the building.


  Carpenter said the county will reevaluate on Tuesday.


  This closure does not include the Greenup County Courthouse Annex. The court system will make that decision.


  Greenup County’s health department announced eight new cases on Saturday, pushing the tally to 678. It is “red” because the number of cases based on a per-100,000-people formula is at 26.1 — 25 and higher puts a county at “red.”


  Of the new cases, one — a 58-year-old female — is hospitalized. The other cases involved a 2-year-old boy, a 20-year-old male, a 48-year-old male and four females, ages 73, 62, 33 and 25.


  Six females, ages 51, 34, 34, 18, 46 and 55, and three males, ages 4, 40 and 20, have tested positive for COVID-19 in Boyd County, according to the health department’s Saturday report. There have been 758 total cases in the county, including 24 deaths and 531 recoveries.


  Carter County’s health department reported nine new cases on Saturday. The seven-day rate is 30.9, leaving the county in the red zone.

As the country lurches toward Election Day, activists, right-wing militants, racial justice organizations, and everyday voters have been preparing themselves for the possibility of widespread and violent civil unrest. Spurred by a year of historic tumult, they’re constructing their own bulletproof vests, stockpiling food, buying guns for the first time, and planning escape routes to safe spaces off the grid.


  Ryan Nichols, a military veteran, Republican, and citizen search and rescue operator, said he no longer trusts that the nation’s institutions will be able to keep the peace.


  “What is really happening right now is people want weapons to defend themselves,” he said. “Everybody feels this way in my circles. I don’t trust my government, and that’s coming from me as a Republican, a veteran. I don't trust the country. I don't trust people at all levels of government who are overseeing me to do right by me. I trust people like myself.”


  Across the political divide, Mary-Katherine Fleming, an independent activist who supports Black leaders around Denver, said she worries about right-wing extremists and police officers targeting racial justice protesters, not to mention the militants who often show up to support law enforcement.


  She and fellow activists are collecting food, water, and toilet paper in case supply chains break down or “Black and brown residents are too afraid to go to the store or hospital.” They’re amassing first aid kits, respirators, and protective vests; they’re hosting trainings on self- and community defense and how to spot tactics that law enforcement agents use to infiltrate their groups.


  “We are preparing for an extended period of protest that will make the summer look like camp,” she said. “People have this idea that it’s all going to be over after the election. It’s not.”

O Tenente Coronel Brandão Ferreira (BF) publicou no jornal “Observador” (26 de outubro de 2020) um artigo informado, como é seu timbre, intitulado “O sindicalismo militar”, em que contestava alguns pontos de vista por mim expressos num artigo publicado no “Jornal Económico” (8 de outubro de 2020), com o título “Acabou-se a Poesia”. Se existe coincidência de pontos de vista sobre o estado em que se encontra a Instituição Militar relativamente às soluções, são enormes as divergências.


  Convém esclarecer que o significado da expressão “sindicalismo” utilizada no meu artigo tem uma natureza inclusiva. Refere-se a formas avançadas de associativismo militar, que permitam ultrapassar o estado de esgotamento atingido pela presente fórmula associativa. Só com essas formulações será possível, por exemplo, evitar a deterioração do regime remuneratório das Forças Armadas ocorrido desde a aprovação da LDNFA, em 1982, participando os “sindicatos” militares na Concertação Social, onde se decide as remunerações da Administração Pública. Em última análise, seja qual for o modelo associativo adotado, a sua configuração dependerá do seu conteúdo, daquilo que se propuser fazer. Utilizaremos a expressão “sindicalismo”, devendo o leitor ter presente o seu significado mais abrangente.


  Não pretendo com este texto entrar numa esgrima de parada e resposta. Contudo, algumas afirmações do artigo referido obrigam ao exercício do contraditório.


  Para ultrapassar o atual impasse, é proposto “um golpe de Estado” como a solução para os problemas que a Instituição Militar enfrenta. Seria muito difícil explicar aos portugueses a bondade de um golpe de Estado como forma de um determinado grupo melhorar a sua situação social. Excluo a possibilidade de um golpe de Estado com outros objetivos. Não participarei nessa discussão. O debate que o meu artigo parece ter promovido baseia-se apenas em propostas exequíveis no quadro democrático.

When you read history in books, events can seem as if they were destined all along. It becomes easy to think, albeit subconsciously, that the happy ending was inevitable — if only because the unhappy one is unthinkable. So, of course the Union routed the Confederacy. Of course the Great Depression eased. Of course we won World War II. Of course.


  But when you read the contemporaneous accounts, the letters and news stories written as American boys were being chewed up at Shiloh, as American families were being evicted from their homes, as American ships and sailors were burning at Pearl Harbor, there is no “of course.” In the desperate and uncertain time before news becomes history, there is only the sobering realization of how much there is to lose — and how easily it could all be lost.

Da quando il governo ha pubblicato la lista dei negozi di prima necessità, la polemica sul ruolo delle librerie e dei commerci di vicinato non fa che aumentare. Il ministro dell’economia ha cercato di calmare le acque venerdì, annunciando la chiusura di tutti i reparti culturali degli ipermercati o dei negozi multiservizio come la Fnac. Ma non è bastato a tranquillizzare il settore, che denuncia anche la concorrenza sleale delle piattaforme di vendita online. Dopo la tribuna su Le Monde di un collettivo di librai, editori e scrittori che chiedono a Macron di “scegliere la cultura”, ieri oltre 50 sindaci, tra cui quasi tutti quelli delle grandi città francesi, hanno scritto al primo ministro perché trovi una soluzione. Nel frattempo in diverse piccole e medie cittadine, come Perpignan o Colmar, hanno pubblicato delle ordinanze per autorizzare l’apertura dei negozi non alimentari. La situazione è così seria e la fronda così estesa che stasera alle 20 il primo ministro andrà in tv per annunciare delle nuove misure per ristabilire l’equilibrio tra piccoli negozi e grandi magazzini.

Mucho le pedí, mucho le rogué que cumpla mi sueño y por fin llegaste a mi vida... Sé perfectamente que los tiempos de Dios son perfectos, por eso ahora nos envió la bendición tan deseada y anhelada, que llena de amor nuestra familia, me alegra y entusiasma saber todo lo que nos falta por vivir, juntos, unidos... Porque ya nos dimos cuenta de que así lograremos todos nuestros planes y sueños en familia”, se lee en mensaje que publicó Christian Domínguez en su cuenta de Instagram. Además, señaló que es “bonito” ver a Pamela Franco al llegar a casa y “saber que me das los mejores consejos, fuerzas para jamás dejar de avanzar... Vamos por mucha más felicidad mi cielo... TE AMO”. Este tierno mensaje de Christian Domínguez fue en respuesta al que Pamela Franco le escribió una hora antes en la misma red social. “Mi amor solo puedo decirte cosas bonitas y más en este día me haces feliz en todo el sentido de la palabra y vivimos un amor bonito todos los días sin importar nada, solo lo que sentimos 😍 ahora viviendo una etapa hermosa en compañía de todas las personas que nos quieren de verdad, solo me queda decirte que estoy aquí para ti siempre en los buenos y sobre todo en los malos momentos, por que de esos saldremos adelante siempre juntos, además estamos con Dios.

With millions already voting last week across Georgia and across the country in an election a majority find stressful, the answer might not come Tuesday night, which will add to the anxiety. But finding other things to focus on and trusting in the system could help people get through it, experts at Augusta University said.


   


  Early voting and voting by mail proved far more popular than previous elections, and millions across Georgia and across the United States took advantage of it. By the end of Friday, more than 85 million people had made their choice early, either through voting in person or by mail, according to the U.S. Elections Project.


   


  That included more than 3.6 million voters in Georgia, 51.7% of the electorate, with 2.5 million early votes and 1.1 million mail votes, or about 65% of those who had requested a ballot, according to the project. More than 45% of voters in Richmond County have cast a ballot already compared to 55% in Columbia County and 58% in McDuffie County, according to the Elections Project.


   


  Georgia counties are allowed to open and scan mailed ballots a couple of weeks prior to Election Day but can't start counting until the polls close Tuesday.


   


  When asked to give a percentage chance there will be an answer Tuesday night, Dr. Craig Albert answers with a laugh.


   


  "Zero," he said. "Zero percent chance."


   


  A big reason is all of those mailed ballots, said Albert, an associate professor of political science at AU. Nationwide, more than 90 million mail-in ballots have been requested and as of late last week 54.7 million had been returned, with nearly 36 million still out there, according to the Election Project.


   


  "Depending on how many votes are cast by mail-in, and we are thinking it is a huge percentage, there will just be no way (to get an early answer)," Albert said.


   


  Those states that heavily favor Republicans or Democrats, such as Wyoming and California, will likely be called on election night. But for others there could be a long wait as those mailed ballots are processed, Albert said.


   


  "It's those battleground states where this really comes into play," he said. "Those states that Trump won in 2016, Wisconsin, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, that could go either way, those states are once again going to determine the election, and each of those states have different laws for processing their mail-in ballots."


   


  Georgia could be among them because of the large number of mailed ballots and new elections systems the state instituted very recently, Albert said.


   


  "It could be two weeks out from Election Day that we figure out who won Georgia," he said.


   


  That means people will have to view this election differently.


   


  "We're going to have to be patient," Albert said. "We are going to have to treat this as the playoffs. We're going to have to first of all trust the integrity of the federal system. It works. We have institutions in place to ensure that ballot security is good to go. It will just look different."


   


  That is not likely to be a comfort to people already anxious about this election, which appears to be most Americans. More than two-thirds of those recently surveyed -- 68% -- said the election is a significant source of stress, much higher than in 2016 when just over half said that, according to the American Psychological Association.


   


  Dr. Rohini Mehta sees it in her patients in Augusta.


   


  "Much like the COVID-19 pandemic, this election is marked by uncertainty, and when we have uncertainty, anxiety spikes," said Mehta, an assistant professor of psychiatry at AU. "It's human nature to want to be in control of our destiny. And in these unprecedented times, it is even more so a concern that we won't know the outcome until it's time."


   


  One way to cope with that is not to pore over every last detail, she said.


   


  "There is such a thing as information overload," Mehta said. "If you are noticing that in yourself, it may be important to take a step back and take a break from the media cycle. Additionally, it is important to know what you can control and control what you can and seek to understand what you cannot. Sometimes just taking a step back from things that can further exacerbate that feeling of uncertainty is a helpful way to control what you can."


   


  She counsels her patients to focus on self-care.


   


  "What are the things in their lives that are restorative, that give them energy and give them quality of life?" Mehta said. "And in these difficult and unprecedented times it is important to maximize that as much as we can."


   


  Patients should talk to their doctor before beginning an exercise program, but if it is advisable, that is a good approach, she said.


   


  "Exercise is a great way to relieve stress, improve sleep and increase quality of life," Mehta said.


   


  As a bonus, for those who remembered to do it, the new week begins with an extra hour to sleep as daylight saving time ends, so take advantage of it, she said.


   


  "Sleep is linked to anxiety, so quality of sleep is an important factor in minimizing anxiety as much as we can," Mehta said.

Capitalism can function under different forms of government, including brutal dictatorships. There is nothing inherent in the dynamics of a capitalist economy that allows democracy to flourish. Calls for the recognition of social rights and demands for freedom, political participation and democratic governance have always come in fact from those who were exposed to the cruelties and injustices which are naturally built into a capitalist system of economic and social life. Democratic rights were gained, advanced and secured under capitalism, almost everywhere in the world, through prolonged social and political struggles from below. They were not granted to the masses by the masters of capital themselves. The right of workers to unionize, for instance, has a long and bloody history behind it. The U.S., in fact, has had the bloodiest and most violent labor history of any industrialized capitalist country in the world. By the same token, there are limits to how far democracy can advance under capitalism. Direct participatory democracy and economic democracy are anathema to a capitalist organization of socio-economic life. And under neoliberal capitalism -- which is essentially a politico-economic project that aims to return society to the age of predatory capitalism when labor power was completely "free" -- nature is totally at the mercy of unrestrained capital exploitation, and state policies cater exclusively to the interests and needs of the plutocrats, and thus democracy is a sham. Competition is seen as the defining characteristic of what it means to be human, citizens are turned into consumers, and society is dog-eat-dog.

California [US], November 2 (ANI/Xinhua): Focus Features and Amblin's horror- thriller film "Come Play" led ticket sales at the sleepy North American Halloween box office with mere 3.15 million U.S. dollars from 2,183 locations in its opening weekend, according to studio figures collected by measurement firm Comscore.   Directed by Jacob Chase and starring Azhy Robertson, Gillian Jacobs and John Gallagher Jr., the PG-13 Halloween offering follows the parents of Oliver, a lonely young boy with autism, as they fight to save their son from a villainous humanoid creature that preys on the innocence of children.   "Thank you everyone for going to the theaters! You have all helped make #ComePlay the number one movie at the box office," the director Chase tweeted, adding that "Wowzers! You have all made my Halloween very happy!"   Comscore noted that only around 49 per cent of all North American Theaters are currently open. Although movie theaters outside New York City were allowed to reopen in New York state at 25 per cent capacity under state guidance starting Oct. 23, Los Angeles and some other major markets in the country remained closed due to the pandemic.   "With those venues shuttered, studios are wary of releasing big-budget potential blockbusters," reported Variety magazine, adding that "For the time being, studios are siphoning off smaller movies like 'Come Play,' supernatural thriller 'The Empty Man' and family flick 'The War With Grandpa.' "  
 "It's a chance for theater owners to offer audiences new products, sure, but such offerings are hardly moving the needle for ticket sales," explained Variety.   "Come Play" holds an approval rating of 52 per cent based on 79 reviews to date on review-aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes.   Open Road Films' action thriller "Honest Thief" moved to second place with 1.35 million dollars from 2,360 locations in its fourth weekend, pushing its North American total to 9.53 million dollars to date.   Directed by Mark Williams and starring Liam Neeson in the title role, the film follows a former bank robber who turns himself in to the authorities to start a new life after falling in love with a woman, only to be double-crossed by two ruthless FBI agents who want to devour his fortune.   "The War with Grandpa," the 101 Studios' family comedy film, came in third with 1.08 million dollars from 2,365 locations in its fourth weekend.   Directed by Tim Hill and based upon the novel of the same name by the late American children's book author Robert Kimmel Smith, the film stars two-time Academy Award winner Robert De Niro. The plot follows a sixth-grader who works to get his grandfather to move out of his room after he moves in with his family. (ANI/Xinhua)

PHILADELPHIA — Joe Biden is spending the final days of the presidential campaign appealing to Black supporters to vote in-person during a pandemic that has disproportionally affected their communities, betting that a strong turnout will boost his chances in states that could decide the election.
 Biden was in Philadelphia on Sunday, the largest city in what is emerging as the most hotly contested battleground in the closing 48 hours of the campaign. He planned to participate in a “souls to the polls” event that is part of a nationwide effort to organize Black churchgoers to vote.
 His running mate, Kamala Harris, was in Georgia, a longtime Republican stronghold that Democrats believe could flip if Black voters show up in force. The first Black woman on a major party's presidential ticket, she encouraged a racially diverse crowd in a rapidly growing Atlanta suburb to “honor the ancestors” by voting, invoking the memory of the late civil rights legend, longtime Rep. John Lewis.
 President Donald Trump is aiming to blunt the effort by arguing that Biden and other Democrats have taken the support of Black voters for granted.
 “Show Joe Biden and the Democrat Party what you think of their decades of betrayal and abuse,” Trump told supporters on Sunday at a rally north of Detroit.
 With more than 91 million votes already cast, Trump and Biden are out of time to reshape the race. Instead, they’re focusing on their base and making sure that any potential supporters have either already voted or plan to do so in person on Tuesday.
 For Biden, that means paying close attention to Black voters who are a critical part of the coalition he needs to build to win. His campaign’s final burst of travel was tailored to boost that support: After Philadelphia, he was to be in Cleveland and Pittsburgh on Monday. And after stops with Biden in Detroit and Flint, Michigan, on Saturday, former President Barack Obama heads to Georgia on Monday.
 When the pandemic reached America, Democrats spent months pushing their supporters to vote by mail. But their energy has shifted to urge Black supporters who have long preferred to vote in person or distrust voting by mail to get out on Tuesday. Biden’s campaign has tried to reverse the drop in Black turnout from 2012 to 2016 — with decreases in cities such as Milwaukee, Cleveland, and Philadelphia — that contributed to Trump's upset against Democrat Hillary Clinton.
 A Biden path toward victory must include Black majority cities, including Philadelphia and Detroit, which will be crucial in determining the outcome in Pennsylvania and Michigan. Those are states where both candidates have spent a significant amount of time in the final days of the 2020 election.
 “The historical but also cultural reality for our community is that Election Day represents a collective political act and it’s a continuation of our struggle for full citizenship in this country,” said Adrianne Shropshire, the executive director of BlackPAC. “Black voters are showing up in ways that they did not in 2016 and we can take heart in that.”
 In Detroit, officials are projecting a 50% voter turnout, which would be higher than 2016, yet lower than 2008 and 2016 when Obama’s candidacy drew record voter participation. Grassroots organizers in the Philadelphia area have spent months engaging potential voters, many of whom they expect will be casting ballots for the first time on Election Day.

Carlos Jackson Klutts, 69, of Austin, Texas, beloved husband, father, and grandfather passed away on October 19th, 2020. Carlos was born on Valentine’s Day 1951 to Barney Carroll Klutts and Hazel Joyce Klutts in Rising Star, Texas. Carlos is preceded in death by his mother and father, his brother, Jimmy Carroll Klutts, and his sister, Vanita Joy Klutts. He is survived by his wife of 49 yrs, Cynthia DeLoach Klutts, daughter, Tiffany Klutts Brumley of Austin, son Brandt Carlton Klutts and wife Kim of Boerne, and Clayton Morgan Klutts and wife Katherine of Austin. Paw Paw is also survived by his ten grandchildren; Buddy, Ellie, Mary Morgan, and Wren Brumley of Austin, Brooks, Molly, and Weston Klutts of Boerne, and Carter, Clayton, and Charlie Klutts of Austin.   Carlos attended Smithville High school, Blinn Junior College and the University of Texas. He started selling land with his dad at 14 years old. After a brief stint as a brakeman with the Katy Railroad, Carlos began working as a consultant and entrepreneur in the Texas oil field. Having been born into a family of farmers and ranchers, Real Estate was a natural calling as he had been taught the love for the land. He cherished being with people and loved fulfilling their dreams of owning their own piece of Texas. As a Ranch Broker he relished selling 5 acre tracts just as much as thousand acre ranches. Every sale meant a new friend, and his closest friends all shared his passion of putting deals together. He respected and valued those who worked hard and dealt fairly.   Smithville is also where he met the love of his life, Cindy DeLoach Klutts. Cindy and Carlos were high school sweethearts and true life partners, working together every day in their real estate business. Carlos would sell the land, and Cindy would handle the rest. Theirs was a true love story, spanning 49 years of marriage.   Carlos and Cindy moved to Lockhart, Texas in 1976 where they built their family home, raised their children and continue to gather making wonderful memories. While in Lockhart, Carlos became a member of the Lockhart Masonic Lodge where he thoroughly cherished the masonic brotherhood. He had the honor of receiving his 40-year pin recently. He appreciated the friendships he made everywhere he lived in Texas. Carlos was a larger than life character that never met a stranger and always had a smile, a warm handshake and a joke to fit the occasion. What brought him the most joy in life was to make everyone around him happy. He always took the time to let those around him know how he felt about them. It was a special gift that he gave to his family that he spent so much time with each one of them. Mimi and Paw Paw attended nearly every one of their grandkids’ games and activities. He always made everyone feel special and loved. We all have such great peace knowing that he is now with his Lord and Savior, because he shared his faith and trust in God with each of us throughout our lives.   We’re all going to miss his cowboy hat and big smile but especially the daily saying, “It’s a Beautiful Day in Texas!”   Serving as pallbearers will be Buddy Brumley, Mark Connally, Dean Greer, Corey Hoffpauir, Michael Joseph, Brooks Klutts, Weston Klutts, Brandt Klutts, Clayton Klutts, Robert Puckett, Chris Thompson, Bill Schoppe.   Serving as honorary pallbearers will be Alan Bergstrom, Bill Bunte, Charlie Cox, Rusty DeLoach, Jim Egloff, Bob Hudkins, Jim Kershaw, Bill Schroeder, John Selman.   Funeral services were held at Hyde Park Baptist Church, on Monday, October 26, 2020. Burial followed at Oak Hill Cemetery in Smithville.

Over the last century, since the end of World War II, we have become aware at a global level of how profoundly interdependent we are. Trump's nationalism, chauvinism, isolationism, his anti-internationalism, all his know-nothing-ism and adulation of white supremacy belong to a time that is long past. We are past the time when the United States was the sole world power. It is time that we rejoin the global community.
