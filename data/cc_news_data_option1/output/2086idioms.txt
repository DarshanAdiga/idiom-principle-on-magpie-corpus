Phillips gets under MVP's skin by asking him how his jaw feels after the Claymore. Nice! These two have faced each other a good bit recently as Phillips mentions Riott doesn't have a great record against Bianca. Laying the groundwork for a story already. I like it! Immediately the fans being there makes a huge difference. They tie up and Ruby throws some rights as they go into a test of strength. Belair wins easily so Ruby stomps the foot to break. Belair gets a shoulder in the corner and a hiptoss coming back out. They fight to the opposite corner and Belair uses her power advantage, but a slam is slid out of and Belair gets a boot to the face. She catches a charging Ruby with a tilt a whirl slam for two. Things slow a little as Belair goes to a neck crank as Ruby is forced to fight out and gets a roll-up for two. In the corner again as Bianca throws some stomps and then hits a dropkick. She charges but Riott is out and Belair hits shoulder first into the post. The sound on that was great! Ruby is now in control as she throws some punches and stomps a mud hole in the corner. MVP is right on about Ruby giving Bianca too much time. It proves prophetic as she misses two charges and then gets caught with a fall-a-way slam. Riott comes back with the STO for a two count and a boot to the face for another two count. Ruby heads up top, but gets caught and dropped face first on the turnbuckle. The KOD finishes at 5:47.

The Vikings’ seemingly annual effort to upgrade the line, though, has started this spring without five players able to work on the field together in OTAs. Congregating with teammates at Thielen’s gym in Lakeville is an ad hoc effort by Bradbury to recreate what he’d normally have during spring practices in Eagan with offensive line coach Rick Dennison and offensive coordinator Gary Kubiak.
 “Two days a week, we’re getting on the field and doing football work, and we’re going through whatever we would be doing for an individual period with Coach Dennison,” Bradbury said. “That’s the beauty of being up here and being with some linemen, and I know that the guys in other cities are doing the same thing.

“I think in terms of improvement, consistency is kind of the biggest thing for me,” he said. “It’s such a long season, so you watch a few stretches where you have a few good games and you kind of don’t have such a good game, and so with all this time you’re able to reflect on, ‘What was I doing, what was I not doing, that was kind of prohibiting me from having the consistency?’

Another bonus for Gard is the core of his team is a group of veterans that helped Wisconsin win a share of the Big Ten Conference title last season. The Badgers return seven members of an eight-man rotation that ended the season with eight consecutive victories.


  “They’re not away from us with a lack of knowledge with what is coming and what an offseason needs to look like and how their bodies need to be,” Gard said. “They have a pretty good barometer of how they train themselves.”


  One challenge would be getting a group of six true freshmen up to speed during any sort of abbreviated offseason. But Gard wants that group’s main priority to be finishing up its high school education, with only point guard Lorne Bowman done with classes.

“We’re not as pressed to make immediate decisions as maybe some other teams are or some other schools are that have a lot of roster flux going on,” Gard said.


  Being stuck at home hasn’t been all bad for Gard. It’s allowed him to get an early start on re-watching video from the 2019-20 season. Plus, it’s given him a chance to do two coaching clinics of his own online and watch others through the Wisconsin Basketball Coaches Association and the National Association of Basketball Coaches.


  “I think those have been really good just to stay sharp and look at new ideas,” he said.


  Gard said he tries not to spend much time worrying about what’s going to happen down the road. Right now, he’s taking a wait-and-see approach and trying to be patient.

Since the NHL is planning to go straight to the playoffs, it’s handing out a handful of trophies for the regular season cut short by the coronavirus pandemic.


  Not long after unveiling a 24-team right to the playoffs format, the league on Thursday announced the winners of its regular-season awards. Play was halted March 12 with 189 regular-season games remaining.


  Washington’s Alex Ovechkin and Boston’s David Pastrnak share the Maurice “Rocket” Richard Trophy as the top-goal scorer after tying with 48. Although Ovechkin was stopped short of a ninth 50-goal season, his ninth goal-scoring title extends his NHL record.


  Edmonton’s Leon Draisaitl won his first Art Ross Trophy for leading the league with 110 points, which he accomplished in 71 games. Oilers general manager Ken Holland praised Draisaitl for producing at that clip playing with and apart from captain Connor McDavid.
