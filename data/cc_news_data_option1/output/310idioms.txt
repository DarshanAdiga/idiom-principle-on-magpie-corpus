Le jeune styliste d’origine camerounaise veut se servir de son expérience pour motiver les jeunes. Il s’engage pour la fondation "Fight for Africa" qui aide les étudiants africains à lancer leur propre projet. C’est d’ailleurs Charly qui a créé la tenue de Bea Diallo, l'ancien champion du monde de boxe, pour son retour sur le ring le 11 janvier dernier au Heysel, au profit de la même association.

We will always need data; when done well and using the right metrics it can uncover, illuminate and emphasise a range of different aspects of our society. But we will also always need a critical eye with which to view it, and a genuine interest in the people and stories behind the numbers. Out of context, statistics are nothing more than pixels on a screen or ink on paper.

COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Motorcyclists in Ohio would be allowed to wear earphones or earplugs while riding under a measure meant to ward off hearing loss, under a bill on its way to Gov. Mike DeWine. The House and Senate have both approved the legislation, which would prohibit motorcyclists from listening to music or other entertainment while wearing the ear protection, Gongwer News Service reported. The Senate passed it unanimously on Wednesday. Noise from the wind and engines can produce severe hearing loss for motorcyclists, said Sen. Rob McColley, a Republican from Napoleon in northwestern Ohio. A message was left with the Republican governor's office asking whether DeWine would sign the bill.

It also includes, when you dig deeper, a record increase in women working full-time, thought to be driving the overall growth. With feminists having long decried the low-paid, part-time work women find themselves locked in, and the undervaluing of domestic work and care, you might expect this to be welcome. But within the rise are the nearly four million so-called Waspi women affected by changes to the state pension age which mean they will have to work until 66 instead of 60. According to the campaign, many report struggling to continue in their previous jobs due to health issues - in many cases, caused by the difficult work they've undertaken for more than 40 years.

It is from 'To A Louse' but it could hardly be more apposite in the context of the UK Government's inflated sense of the country's ability to go it alone with Brexit.

However, that is a frustrating situation for the SNP. It has a lot of MPs, but its share of the vote has not increased enough to escape from the minority position it was in at the referendum. It has no real basis on which to demand another referendum from Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Of course it huffs and puffs and claims to speak for the people of Scotland, but that is just so much hot air and does not change its minority status.
