The blackface takedowns: In the context of George Floyd's death and the Black Lives Matter movement, Netflix was quick to realize that its subscribers might take offense to Matt Lucas and David Walliams doing blackface sketches in Little Britain (pictured) and Come Fly With Me. It scrubbed the shows from its archive last Friday, with the BBC, BritBox and Sky soon following suit. Netflix then doubled down by removing other Brit hits, The League Of Gentlemen and The Mighty Boosh, for the same reason, as well as four shows from Aussie comedian Chris Lilley. HBO Max took similar action over Gone With The Wind (though promised to restore it with historical context).

While a number of factors are used to calculate pension benefits, Chauvin would likely be eligible for annual payments in the ballpark of $50,000 a year or more if he chose to start receiving them at age 55, according to a CNN analysis based on Chauvin's tenure, 2019 payroll data, contract details, pension plan guidance and Minneapolis Police Department salary schedules. The benefits could stretch to $1.5 million or more over a 30-year period, not including any cost of living increases. Chauvin's annual payments could be even higher if he received significant amounts of overtime in prior years.

In light of recent violence on CBS's _Big Brother 2_ , online survey service E-Poll has concluded that a good chunk of reality TV viewers believe producers cast unstable people in reality projects on purpose in order to boost ratings.
 Following up on a recent reality survey it conducted (B&C Fax 7/18), E-Poll found 51% of the 2,223 reality TV viewers they surveyed believe people like Justin Sebik, yanked from _Big Brother 2_ for pulling a knife on a fellow castmate, are chosen on purpose. Just 13% think that networks are doing the best they can on background checks.
 As far as who would be to blame if someone was seriously injured on a reality series - something that's been predicted for NBC's stunt-heavy _Fear Factor_ and _Spy TV_ \- E-Poll reports that 58% of its sample would say the producer or network is at fault. But 42% would say that contestants know what they are getting into. Also of note, if someone were to get seriously hurt, 69% would want the tape of that scene destroyed; 31% would say that the show must go on. - _Susanne Ault_

In India, he said, 80 per cent adult population has bank accounts, which is better than the global average. Addressing a virtual CII seminar on Fintech and Digitisation, Kant said the Indian fintech market will mature and there is a need to make the country a fintech hub. As Indias fintech matures, there will be huge opportunity for existing as well as new fintech companies to adapt and grow... there is a need to re-evaluate the existing KYC paradigm to make it highly cost-effective and easy to do. Video on boarding and use of AI can be the way forward, he said.  Kant further said India has prepared itself for disruption that has happened by pushing digitisation, while in the Western world, leaders are still figuring out how to distribute money to people and business affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Daily Beast has an interview with Laverne Cox in light of the recent high- profile idiocy from a certain billionaire author. Laverne completely eviscerated Rowling's recent rant against transgender women without even mentioning her name or deigning to refute any of her asinine "points." She calls it for what it was, a means to pit "feminists" (I put that in quotes because I do not consider those people siding with Rowling feminists and I do not want that to be a dirty word) against transgender people. The Daily Beast references their analysis of Rowling's essay by Laura Bradly, who breaks down Rowling's argument as a dog-whistle-filled mess with anti-trans talking points. Cox explains that when marginalized groups turn against each other it only benefits the ruling class, of which Rowling is definitely one. The fact that Rowling chose this moment to further bash an already misunderstood and targeted group says so much about who she is. Laverne has a new documentary premiering on Netflix next week called _Disclosure_ , which explores the portrayal and history of trans people on film. It includes famous trans people like Laverne, MJ Rodriguez, Lilly Wachowski and Chaz Bono.
