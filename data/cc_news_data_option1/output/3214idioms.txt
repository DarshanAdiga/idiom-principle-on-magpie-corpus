A phased in approach gives us time to iron out the essential safety details for day to day operations that have not been decided upon and agreed to as of August 12. These include, but are not limited to: how we get students safely dropped off by parents and buses and into the buildings and classrooms in all kinds of weather; how many students can be safely in each classroom maintaining not only the six feet social distancing but also the behaviors of our students, especially those who have historically struggled in a pre- pandemic classroom environment that allowed movement and social interaction; how we safely arrange mask breaks, hallway movement, and bathroom visits; how we safely serve, supervise, and clean up after lunches while making sure staff members get their own 30 minute lunches at a reasonable hour; how we safely provide pull out and push in services; how we safely dismiss students at the end of the day; how we safely conduct fire drills; and how we safely deal with non-compliant students and/or parents. The protocols determining how we deal with these details will be essential to the safe operation of our schools, and they have not been created.

In case you had better things to do from 2008, when Cyrus was first linked to Liam Hemsworth, to the start of this year, when they finalized their divorce after less than a year of marriage, then yes, her confession is seemingly about the Australian actor. Cyrus added that she "lied" to Hemsworth "and said he wasn't the first so I didn't seem like a loser" and that "the first time I ever hooked up with anyone, it was a girl — two of them, actually."

With a new moon Aug. 18, we have the promise of skies as dark as they get, offering a view of the Milky Way.      A view from a truly dark rural site on a very clear night can be astonishing for anyone not accustomed to such skies. The billowing Milky Way arches through the summer evening sky, with a myriad stars - ranging from bright to very dim, sparkling over your head and on every side.      Yet it's a great time to look even in semi-rural conditions. The Milky Way is so bright, it may still be dimly seen, and the constellations are impressive as always.      Note: A hazy atmosphere will hide most of the Milky Way. Also, avoid street, town and neighborhood lights as much as you can.      Most brilliant of all this summer is the planet Jupiter and, to the left of it, planet Saturn, also very bright. Our giant neighbors in the outer solar system stand out in 2020, beacons of the night sky and easily seen even in an urban sky.      Do what you can to trace the Milky Way. Looking at around 10 p.m. in mid- August, once the sky is dark, the Milky Way stretches from the northeast, creating a backdrop for the famous W-shape of the constellation Cassiopeia, reaching overhead through the Northern Cross (part of Cygnus the Swan), down through Aquilia the Eagle and leading to Sagittarius and Scorpius in the south (low in the south if viewed from mid-northern latitudes).      It is here, in the area of Sagittarius, where the Milky Way is widest. We are literally looking at the central hub of the great spiral galaxy where we live, known collectively as the Milky Way.      The rest of the Milky Way band, which completely encircles the sky, is made up of the spiral arms of this galaxy. The sun and its planets - including Earth - is right in the midst of these arms, about halfway from the edge towards the central hub. We have an inside look at the arms, which from our perspective are overlapping and blend together.      With even a simple pair of binoculars or a telescope of any size, sweep across the Milky Way and see how this hazy band bursts into faint stars. Obviously, the larger the telescope and depending on how dark and clear your skies are, the more you will see and enjoy.      Part of Sagittarius constellation, the stars marking the outline of the "Teapot" is well placed, with the puffy-appearing Milky Way seeming to rise like celestial steam from the Teapot's "spout."      Just with the naked eye, observe how the Milky Way band is curiously split as you look up from the southern sky and Sagittarius, up through Aquilia and Cygnus.      What you are seeing is not a gap, but evidence of a cast, dark nebula of dust obscuring the light of the distant spiral arm stars in the background. You may be a fastidious housekeeper and keep chasing away dust bunnies, but the fact is, dust is everywhere. Dust, as well as gas, permeates the galaxy; from certain nebulous regions, stars are formed.      As you explore the Milky Way deeper with binoculars or a telescope, you can find many more dark nebulae, which are plotted on detailed star atlases.      Also abundant through the Milky Way band are star clusters, some rich and bright, some sparse, some dim and small, but each fascinating to fathom and compare. These star clusters are gatherings of stars, siblings as it were, from the same nebulous star cradle, on their journey in space - bound by gravitation and, I like to muse, mutual affection.      Look for the many-colored stars. White, blue-white, orange and red are common. They bespeak of stellar "life cycles" and variations in temperature, luminosity, chemical makeup and age. Many stars vary in brightness. We are also concluding that most may have planets of their own, evoking our imagination.      Use a star map to delve into the central hub, in the south on a mid-August evening. There are several bright and beautiful nebulous clouds (with names such as the Lagoon, Trifid, Horseshoe and Eagle), "star clouds" and amazing star clusters.   Jupiter and Saturn adds to the heavenly show, to the left of the "Teapot."      This show is free and waiting for you to go out and see.      Keep looking up at the stars!

Arkansas is at a historic low point. Coming off back-to-back 2-10 seasons, the Razorbacks have a new head coach after firing Chad Morris just 22 games into his disastrous tenure in Fayetteville.
 They replaced him with a familiar name, but one who hasn’t been a head coach since leading a junior college team in the early 1990s and hasn’t even been a coordinator at the FBS level. Sam Pittman does have a reputation as an excellent recruiter and developer of offensive linemen, giving the Arkansas fan base at least some hope that he’ll be able to stabilize the program.
 As if that wasn’t already a big enough challenge, Pittman is dealing with unprecedented circumstances during his first offseason. Thanks to the coronavirus pandemic, he and his almost entirely new staff lost all of spring practice, as well as a chunk of offseason conditioning.
 The team reconvened in Fayetteville in June to begin working out and has been doing walk-through practices with the coaching staff on the field for a couple of weeks. Despite uncertainty swirling about the season, which is scheduled to start Sept. 26, Arkansas is still set to begin fall camp Monday.

Barbara Almstead Stoughton   Barbara Jane Almstead Stoughton, 90, of Midland, Michigan passed on into the infinite Monday, August 3rd, 2020, surrounded by all her remaining immediate family.   Barb, as most called her, was born to the late Morris Joseph and Anna Jane (Holden) Almstead in Lakeview, Ohio on October 9, in 1929 and was mostly raised in Syracuse and Skaneateles, New York, where she graduated from Skaneateles High School in 1947 before moving on to get her degree in Radio Broadcasting from Stevens College in Columbia, Missouri. She married the late Dr. Clinton S. Burhans, Jr. in 1949 and traveled extensively with him to Scotland, England, Wales, and Germany before spending much of 1952 as "Miss Melody," host of a popular radio show on TFK/Armed Forces Radio Service at Keflavik, Iceland that was heard by all at the US Naval Air base there, Icelandic residents, and all the ships at sea in the North Atlantic.   Upon return to the States, Barb and husband Clint (now teaching at the University of British Columbia at Vancouver, Canada) and began to raise a family, which continued with their move to Michigan State University and Eaton Rapids, Michigan. There they survived the sixties with style, but their marriage did not. Dr. Burhans buggered off about 1971, leaving Barbara with their four children, a St. Bernard, a giant cat, a huge, beautiful but crumbling Victorian-style 1880s lumber baron mansion on the Grand River in Eaton Rapids, Michigan, and not much else, until she met the late Harold "Bud" Stoughton, pharmacist, actor, and model, marrying him in 1973 and moving the family to Mt. Clemens, Michigan. Bud was a good man and a great father to all and was one of the best things ever to happen to Barb and the rest of the family.   Barb and family moved to Midland, Michigan in 1978, where she went on to be the receptionist at top Midland law firm Currie and Kendall, where she became both the "Mother Superior [and the one who] kept the lawyers in line for decades at C & K" (Fred Rolf Esq.) until retiring in 1997. During this period, she continued as a writer of many published articles in books and magazines.   Barbara, always caring more for family, friends, and colleagues than about herself, was the beloved mother of four who raised five and was predeceased by both husbands, Bronwen (Burhans) McKenzie, (1955-2020), and Jeffery Lee Burhans (1962-2015).   Barb is survived by her brother, James Lee Almstead, his wife Janice (Ozark) Almstead, their son Neil Gregory Almstead, daughter Elizabeth Leigh (Almstead) Elmer and several nieces and nephews, son-in-law James McKenzie, son Clinton Searles Burhans III (1957) and his wife Rebecca Zeiss, son Michael Remington Burhans (1959) and his children Shelby and Kayleigh Burhans, grandson Dylan Michael Burhans (born to Clinton III and first wife Beth Brisbay 1988), raised by Barbara as her fourth son.   Barbara Jane Almstead Stoughton has met the challenges of the hard world of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries for her family and herself relentlessly and done so with beauty, grace, style, humility, humor, and love. She now returns her matter to stardust and her energy to the infinite flow.   As per her wishes, cremation has taken place. Due to Covid-19, there will be no public memorial service. Plans are made for interment at the Midland Cemetery, next to her beloved Bud Stoughton.

 Michael Vasquez appeared for a court hearing Friday morning via a videoconferencing system from the jail and was denied bond by Porter Superior Court Judge Jeffrey Clymer, who cited the probation and said the accused poses a danger to others.
 Vasquez faces his third allegation of violating his probation because of the recent arrest and because he still owes $36,952 in restitution from the 1997 case, according to Porter County Deputy Prosecutor Rebecca Buitendorp.

On July 29, 1941, after Polish prisoner Zygmunt Pilawski fled Auschwitz, Nazi SS guards grabbed 10 other prisoners to die for the man's escape. Father Kolbe heard one of the men chosen, Franciszek Gajowniczek, lamenting this fate, mourning the lost life with his wife and children. Moved by the prisoner's grief, Father Kolbe asked for Gajowniczek's life to be spared, telling the guards to take him instead. "I am a Catholic priest," he said. "Let me take his place. I am old. He has a wife and children." Franciscan Father Kolbe pointed to the prisoner and repeated, "I am a Catholic priest from Poland. I would like to take his place, because he has a wife and children."

Tens of thousands of people flooded the heart of the Belarus capital Minsk on Friday in a show of anger over a brutal police crackdown this week on peaceful protesters that followed a disputed election. Authorities sought to ease rising public fury by freeing at least 2,000 people who were jailed after earlier demonstrations.Factory workers marched across the city shouting &ldquo;Go away!&rdquo; in a call for authoritarian president Alexander Lukashenko to resign after 26 years of iron-fisted rule that was extended in an election Sunday that protesters denounced as rigged. Friday&rsquo;s crowds grew to more than 20,000, filling central Independence Square.About a dozen soldiers guarding the nearby government headquarters lowered their riot shields in what the demonstrators saw as a sign of solidarity, and women rushed to embrace and kiss the guards.As the protesters rallied on the square, Mr Lukashenko dismissed them as puppets manipulated from abroad.During a meeting with top law enforcement officials, he defended the crackdown as a justified response to violence against police by some of the protesters. The interior ministry said 121 police officers were injured.He told officials, however, to avoid excessive force. &ldquo;If a person falls down and lies still, don&rsquo;t beat him,&rdquo; Mr Lukashenko said.The Belarusian leader cautioned people against turning out for protests, saying the country is facing foreign &ldquo;aggression&rdquo;. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get out into the streets. You should understand that you and your children are being used as cannon fodder,&rdquo; Mr Lukashenko said, alleging that people from Poland, the Netherlands, Ukraine and some members of Russia&rsquo;s opposition were fomenting the unrest.&ldquo;Do you want me to sit and wait until they turn Minsk upside down?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t be able to stabilise the situation afterwards. We must take a break, collect ourselves and calm down. And let us restore order and deal with those who have come here.&rdquo;Earlier, police did not interfere as the protesters marched across the city, reflecting Mr Lukashenko&rsquo;s apparent attempt to assuage the opposition by stepping back from the violent police crackdowns seen across the country earlier this week.The release by the interior ministry of about 2,000 of the nearly 7,000 people detained was seen as another move to defuse popular outrage. It said more would be freed.Many who were released spoke of brutal beatings and other abuse by police, and some showed bruises on their bodies. Some of them wept as they embraced waiting relatives.&ldquo;The authorities are obviously trying to de-escalate the situation and ease the tensions, fearing that the furious industrial workers will take to the streets all across Belarus,&rdquo; said Valiantsin Stefanovich of the Viasna rights centre. Demonstrators have swarmed the streets ever since Sunday&rsquo;s election in which officials reported that Mr Lukashenko won 80% of the vote to win a sixth term in office.His main challenger, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who fled on Tuesday to neighbouring Lithuania, posted a new video in which she disputed the results of the vote and demanded that the government start a dialogue with demonstrators.The ferocious crackdown has left hundreds injured since Sunday as police have dispersed the largely peaceful demonstrations with stun grenades, tear gas, rubber bullets and severe beatings. At least one person has been killed.The brutal suppression of protests drew harsh criticism in the West. European Union foreign ministers said they rejected the election results and tasked officials with drawing up a list of people in Belarus who could face sanctions over their role in the crackdown.&ldquo;Work begins on sanctioning those responsible for violence and falsification,&rdquo; tweeted EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell.Earlier, German foreign minister Heiko Maas said the EU wants to &ldquo;significantly increase the pressure on Belarus.&rdquo; Thousands of factory workers who previously formed the core of Mr Lukashenko&rsquo;s base have joined the protests, denouncing the police crackdown and demanding a new election, raising the prospect of a nationwide strike.&ldquo;Our entire shop voted against Lukashenko and then we suddenly learned that he won by a landslide,&rdquo; 42-year-old assembly worker Dmitry Glukhovsky said outside the Minsk Automobile Plant, or MAZ.&ldquo;They not only have cheated us but also beaten us up, and no-one is going to accept that.&rdquo;Ms Tsikhanouskaya urged her supporters to stop protests in an earlier video that her associates said was recorded under pressure from law enforcement officials while she was still in Minsk.The 37-year-old former teacher had joined the race to replace her husband, an opposition blogger, who has been jailed since May.

With the players locked away in the same hotel all the time and matches coming thick and fast, the Champions League this season is more like a World Cup or European Championship finals. The players are living together and can establish a real bond and a 'we have nothing to lose here' attitude. So any of the teams left have a real chance of winning it. People have looked at the fixtures, presumed Manchester City will beat Lyon tomorrow and then play either Barcelona or Bayern Munich in the semi-final.But I'd be very wary of Lyon. Sometimes in a mini-tournament like this a group of players can get a result like Lyon did against Juventus and think, maybe our name is on the cup this year.City are clear favourites to beat Lyon but I have heard Pep Guardiola speak about them and he's urging caution. He knows how good they can be and in a one-off game anything can happen.He'll have seen Atalanta against PSG on Wednesday night and how close that one was. These clubs have put so much work, and money, into getting here and it's all down to one game at a time. One red card, one VAR decision might go against you and you are out. Or a team like Lyon gets a late winner, which could easily happen. This Lyon side went to Turin, defended for their lives and came away with what they needed to knock out Juventus. So City are by no means already through.City should win, but PSG should have breezed past Atalanta and they had a real scare.With the structure of the tournament now, I think teams like Lyon really feel they can win it, and that might not be the case in a standard two-legged tie.And I'd fancy Bayern ahead of Barcelona tonight, they are due to win the Champions League at some stage and this could be their year.

Sounds like someone who has no clue what we need. Yes I'm OK with Willian's signing. He was a free agent but I'm not over the moon about it like edu obviously is. If he sounds this excited about signing a midfielder in the mould of Partey or a defender in the mould of upamecano, then his excitedness is justified. Right now, it is not. How can edu say Willian is what we need. He's a bonus to our forward line but not what we need. We need 2 midfielders and defender as priority but I'm not complaining about willian. Like I said he was free and he impresses me on the field but overall as regards team balance, we're not even close to fixing that unless a Partey comes in and a defender like upamecano etc. Then we can know for certain that we are trying to balance the team. Willian is 32,he's only good in the short term, we need to be planning for the long term as well.

 Both conventions, which are typically raucous affairs inside packed arenas, have been turned almost entirely into virtual affairs due to the coronavirus pandemic. The two events kick off what will be a frenetic two months of campaigning ahead of the Nov 3 election between Trump and Democrat Joe Biden.
 Biden, the former vice president, and Senator Kamala Harris of California will formally accept the Democratic nominations for president and vice president at next week's convention, while Trump and Pence will be nominated for a second four-year term a week later.
 Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, one of only two African-American Republicans in Congress, will be a featured speaker, as well as former US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, first lady Melania Trump and Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa, according to a Trump campaign official.

But Del Solar introduced her to a world of intellectuals that would shape the course of her life and her career — such as the prominent Mexican painter Tamayo, who became a good friend. The two would gather in her kitchen to paint and talk shop, often choosing colors from their environment and imagining how they would re-create them on canvas.
 “We spent much time together using color as a toy,” she recalled in her conversation at LACMA. “‘How do you mix the color of that skirt?’ And then we’d go at it to see who could do it first.”
 Through these circles, she became friends with other artists, too. She met Noguchi shortly after the Japanese American sculptor had been released from a World War II internment camp in Arizona. Later, she would get to know Duchamp, the French surrealist. During their encounter at a friend’s house, he set tongues wagging by rubbing her feet. (The two were just friends, she said in the 2018 Times interview: “The people, they all loved to gossip.”)
 It was through her various art world connections that she ultimately met her second husband, Austrian theorist and painter Wolfgang Paalen, one of the founders of Dynaton, a group of artists who became known for their interest in surreal, abstract and cosmic themes.

In answer to those questions, the first observation worth making is that recent years have witnessed significant geopolitical shifts that have been largely external to Turkey but have impacted upon it. The Cold War’s end offered new threats and opportunities to Turkey, but also became associated with a shift in US attention away from the Soviet menace towards supposed threats from Iraq and Iran, theatres in which Washington and Ankara did not see eye to eye. The immediate post-Cold War years was also associated with transformations in the post-Soviet space, where tensions between Ankara and Moscow arose over developments in Crimea and Chechnya. On the other hand, Turkey’s growing energy dependence elevated the significance of its ties with Russia, Iran and Azerbaijan, amongst others. The Arab Spring and its resultant regional turmoil, including the flow of refugees, the rise of IS and external involvement – notably in Syria, Iraq and Libya – would have attracted the attention of Ankara even if it had remained in the hands of a Kemalist establishment whose instincts were to remain aloof from the quagmire of the Arab world. The Arab Spring also served to raise the profile of the region’s Kurdish issue, not least via the emergence of Kurdish self-administration in Syria’s north. Furthermore, recent US administrations – not only that of President Trump – have given rise to a sense of US disengagement, weakness, inconsistency, unreliability and lack of credibility.

The color-coded system, consisting of green, yellow, orange and red, will be based on a seven-day cumulative rolling average number of new cases per 100,000 people. Each county will receive a green, yellow, orange and red color code that will change daily.
 Counties with between zero and seven positive cases per 100,000 people are considered green, eight to 15 cases per 100,000 people is yellow, 16 to 24 cases per 100,000 is orange and 25 cases or more per 100,000 people is red. If any county falls within the red category, they would go to 100% virtual learning. Christian or private schools in a county would also have to close if the county goes red.
 "The biggest thing you have to do is to try to stay green," Justice said. "That's where we want everybody, but if we can everybody in green and yellow, that's absolutely good. That's exactly what we want to do."
 A map showing the color coding for each county is still being developed by DHHR. The seven-day rolling average numbers will be updated every Saturday night at 9 p.m. for county school systems to look at and determine if a county needs to switch to hybrid learning or all-virtual learning.
 Justice said that any county that falls within the orange or red category prior to Sept. 8 will not be allowed to reopen until cases come down and the county becomes a yellow or green county. As of Friday, Justice said Mingo and Grant counties would be orange and Logan County, which has already seen a 22% increase in active COVID-19 cases, would be red. Active cases in Logan County jumped from 118 active cases Aug. 3 to 194 active cases Monday to 236 active cases as of Friday.
 "You will not open until you get to yellow or green," Justice said. "We don't want to set you up for automatic failure. We think if you're in the orange, you've got to get yourself out of the orange in order to be able to have extracurricular activities or to open the school safely."

Danielle Ulmer, the adoption center manager of the Lynchburg Humane Society, could barely believe her ears when she learned that Dennis Quaid wanted to adopt Dennis Quaid. "I was like, there is no way this is real, like, someone is pranking us," she said.

"Beanbag rounds are purported to be 'less lethal' munitions that should not cause penetrating injuries when used at appropriate distances," the surgeons wrote. "Although our report reflects the experience at only one center during a short period and we cannot determine the frequency of injuries when these munitions are used, these findings highlight the fact that beanbag munitions can cause serious harm and are not appropriate for use in crowd control. ... In light of the ongoing nationwide protests, these observations are relevant to the broader medical community as well as to policymakers seeking to reduce rates of police-induced injuries and fatalities."

“(Sustaining) the morale of the team is just keeping the guys with their heads in it and getting together as much as we can, as safe as we can,” he said. “(We want) to stay with the guys and keep getting closer, keep developing relationships with each other.”

It’s all good indeed. The past 21 months have run the gamut of emotions for Brady and his family as they’ve navigated their way through his recovery. Prior to his diagnosis, Brady was a top young defenseman in the province and was a shoo-in to be drafted in the first two rounds of the 2019 Ontario League draft. But after the diagnosis derailed his season and left so much uncertainty about his future, Brady was drafted in the sixth round by the Generals. And along the way, the journey has been altered. After preparing for years to play in the OHL, Brady is now considering his options. So instead of trying to make the Generals in what will undoubtedly be a truncated season, Brady has decided he’ll either play his final midget season for the Oshawa Jr. Generals or, possibly, at the Jr. A level in the Ontario Jr. A League. It wasn’t what he would have envisioned for his NHL draft year, but his dream didn’t die because of this. It merely took a different route.

“It’s disappointing, it’s frustrating,” head football coach Brent Bolte said. “We know these kids train hard. But, at the end of the day, the decision makers -- and us included -- want to make sure everybody is safe and that we can hopefully move forward at a later time.”
 On the soccer pitch, the BSU women’s soccer team is dealing with the same disappointment. First faced with a reduced schedule and now losing their fall altogether, the Beavers braced for what finally became official this week.
 “I think we’ve been moving in this direction, even though it’s not the place we all wanted to end up,” head coach Jim Stone said. “The more we worked through the situation, it started to move in this direction. But nonetheless, any time something becomes official or finalized, that sense of real starts to kick in. There was sadness.”
 # Planning the next steps
 The Northern Sun also said that it will “explore meaningful opportunities and experiences for fall student-athletes in the spring, if it can be done reasonably and safely.” Whether or not that results in a spring season, Bolte said he’s hoping some good can come out of the bad.

Many observers explain his behaviour with reference to domestic political pay- offs. It is certainly the case that much of his core support base relishes his strutting on the world stage, but it does not necessarily follow that that is the primary reason why he does it. He can hardly be said to have managed Turkey’s economy, or so transparently lined his own pockets and that of his family and associates, with domestic opinion in mind. In any case, he might calculate that the electorate have few options. AKP voters are unlikely to switch to the secular (and troubled) CHP, his control over the media and the courts ensure that he can make life difficult for the Iyi Party and others that have been established by former associates such as Davutoglu and Ali Babacan. The Kurdish HDP has been largely suppressed, its leadership and a third of its membership behind bars, and its elected officials mostly removed from their posts. That leaves the MHP as an alternative home for his voters, but he is in an alliance with them already.  In any case Turkey’s electoral system imposes a 10% threshold for a party to achieve parliamentary representation, which few of the opposition parties look likely to achieve. In 2002 the AKP was able to form a single-party government with just 34% of the vote.

For the past six weeks, Marlin’s coaching staff has worked with his team on campus. First, there were two weeks of voluntary workouts and then two weeks of team drills with some time off in between.
 “I’ve been really impressed with them, their attitudes and putting team first,” Marlin said.
 On paper, Marlin’s team is working this summer to prepare for a season that’s slated to begin on Nov. 10 at Texas with fall practice sessions officially beginning on Sept. 29, but “I don’t think a decision will be made on a basketball starting date until probably the middle of September.”
 What’s got Marlin so up beat is his new-look roster after an offseason of musical chairs.
 “We feel like we’ve addressed our needs,” Marlin said. “Our guys did a good job of evaluating and recruiting during a difficult time. We missed on some early transfers to be honest, but then we came back and were able to snag a couple.
 “We feel really good about our depth, our size – things we didn’t have last year. I think this is the best team we’ve had in the last three years.”
 The program was hoping to get one NCAA waiver claim to go its way and has actually gotten two in 6-11, 225-pound junior transfer Theo Akwuba from Portland and 6-10, 225-pound Brooklyn native freshman Isaiah Richards from Commonwealth Academy in Massachusetts.
 “It was important,” Marlin said. “We were excited. We needed to get one and were hopeful that we’d get one, but we got both. That really gives us some size up front with Isaiah Richards being 6-10 and Theo Akwuba, who is the other young man that’s 6-11 with a 7-6 wingspan.
 “Both of those guys have done really well in our workouts.”

The 34 deaths reported Monday already had marked the highest weeklong tally in over two months — triple the number reported the previous week and significantly higher than during all of June and July, when weekly deaths largely remained in the single digits.
 The Coroner's Office has decided to start reporting death numbers more often to manage the workload and avoid a backlog until the current surge subsides, announcing the latest deaths on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays for the time being.
 The 13 reported Friday include six women and seven men, ages 59 to 101. All victims had underlying medical conditions that made them especially susceptible to severe illness from COVID-19, officials said.
 Three of the patients died in their nursing homes and the others died in the hospital, where their stays varied from several weeks to just a few days.

There are indications that in the Eastern Mediterranean, where Turkey is opposed by a bloc consisting of Greece, Cyprus, Egypt, France and Israel, and in Libya, where Egypt, the UAE, France and Russia find themselves facing Ankara, a more determined resistance to Turkey might be shaping up. Thus far, however, the US has been reluctant to pit itself too firmly against Erdogan, Russia’s President Putin has generally shown willing to find forms of words and arrangements that patch up Moscow’s undoubted differences with Ankara, and the EU has remained weak and internally divided. If Erdogan’s guess is that serious resistance to his actions would only lead to the negotiating table, and that other parties to these disputes might be more obliged to take Turkey’s position into account than would have been the case if its stance had been less aggressive, he might not be proven wrong. He has served notice that the time for riding roughshod over Turkey’s concerns has passed. Only time will tell, possibly quite soon.

Jack Jacob Snyder      Jensen Beach - Jack Jacob Snyder, 96, died August 10, 2020, in Jensen Beach FL. He had a bad fall at home on August 7, and then his heart gave out.      Jack (known within the family as Jake) was born in Venice, CA. He quit high school at the end of 8th grade to make his way in the world. At age 17 he worked in a Civilian Conservation Corps camp for a few months before enlisting in the Navy. Jack loved the Navy and worked his way up from Seaman to Chief Gunners Mate.      During World War II, he served on the USS Missouri, USS Mississippi, and the USS Colorado, among other lesser known ships. In 1946, he met the love of his life, Marion Virden Schusterick, at a dance in Santa Monica, and they were married on February 22, 1946, in Yuma, AZ. A year later they had their only child, Stephen Leslie Snyder, and they moved to Washington DC so that Jack could attend Gunnery School at the Navy Yard.      Jack's next post was at the Naval Base in Norfolk, VA. In 1955, the family was assigned to Bremerhaven, Germany, as part of the North Sea Watch and the Rhine River Patrol. They returned to Northern Virginia in 1958.      After 21 years in the Navy, Jack passed the test to be an officer, but it would have meant going back to sea for six months, and he didn't want to be away from his wife and son any more. So, he retired at 38 and took the Civil Service exam, obtaining a civilian job at the Pentagon, where he worked until he retired for the second time (a disability due to a broken ankle) at the ripe old age of 49. That means he collected dual pensions for 47 years. The Navy was good to him.      In the mid-1960s, Jack also owned a Sinclair gas station, where his son, Stephen, sometimes helped out. He also bought, fixed, and sold boats and cars. They were a boating family, and they had many adventures on the Chesapeake Bay and the Severn River in Maryland.      In 1980, realizing that his son and daughter-in-law were spending every summer in Maine with the grandchildren - Stephen Jr. (Joey) and Kathleen - Jack and Marion bought a waterfront house on Union River Bay in Ellsworth, ME, where they spent summers for 26 years, enjoying the cool weather, the seals cavorting on the rocks in front of their house, and hunting for treasures at flea markets and auctions. Jack also carved many wooden decoys and built rustic furniture.      In 1994, Jack and Marion followed their son's family to Jensen Beach, FL. For the last 10 years or so he enjoyed selling silver jewelry on Thursday nights at the local "Jammin' Jensen" street fair with his son. Jack and Steve were always very close, but after Jack lost his wife in 2014 (after of 68 years of marriage), they were inseparable buddies.      Breakfast was Jack's favorite meal, and he enjoyed eating it at Aunt D's Kitchen almost every day for the last few years, even when Covid-19 made it carry-out.      Jack is survived by his son Stephen and his wife, Lynne Peterson; granddaughter Kathleen Snyder of Fort Mill, SC; and great-grandson Ethan Snyder, a junior at Florida Gulf Coast University. Jack will be cremated by Aycock Funeral Home in Jensen Beach, FL. A graveside service will be held next summer in Sunnyside Cemetery in Eastbrook, ME, where he and his wife, Marion, will be interred alongside their grandson Joey, who died in 2001.

These are trying and stressful times. We have the pandemic along with the pandemonium and its violence across the nation. I’ve heard, “Pastor, I don’t think I can handle one more thing.” Like a forest fire, hurricane, flooding or earthquake? And we have a national election coming up that’s likely to be messy.
 Some are feeling overwhelmed and having a tough time coping. Relationships are on edge with folks a bit testy or more than normal. People are angry, frustrated and afraid. Gatherings like family reunions, July 4th celebrations, birthday parties, church picnics, community festivals, and Vacation Bible Schools — didn’t or aren’t going to happen for the time being. Weddings and funerals are a bit complicated. People have postponed or curtailed weddings. Some funerals have been limited in size or held at gravesides to minimize the risk of exposure to COVID.
 The caring professions are concerned about an increase in child or elder abuse, substance abuse with alcohol and other drugs, suicide and divorce.
 It’s difficult for persons in nursing homes and hospitals, unable to regularly see family members due to the health issues associated with COVID-19. There’s isolation, loneliness and depression. It’s difficult and demanding for staff working at such facilities.
 I am hoping for the best — the development of a vaccine and for folks to follow healthy practices, and for persons to remain calm, respectful and civil in conversations, to come together working for the good of all and helping neighbors in need. But I also must prepare for the possibility of things continuing for some time. Can you imagine going through this in the Christmas season? We are dealing with a lot of uncertainty.
 It is all the more reason for us to do as St. Paul instructs in Ephesians: “Put on the whole armor of God.” We must continue to pray. Pray for the healers — doctors, nurses and other health care professionals. Pray for law enforcement who work to protect and serve our citizens. Pray for pastors who pray for you, offer comfort and care, preach the Word and provide the Sacrament, and offer spiritual guidance pointing to Jesus, our help and hope. Read your Bible individually or as a family. In reading the Book of Psalms, you will find a person who knows the ups and downs of life and affirms the continuing presence of God. When you look to a gospel story like Jesus with His disciples in a boat, in the midst of a storm, you find that it is He who brings peace and calmness. He is with us in all the things that come our way. We are not alone. And we have each other. So we do not give up and we do not give in.
 God is our mighty fortress. God is our refuge and strength. The Lord is near to all who call upon Him. The Lord preserves all who love Him. Thank God for caring for us and for carrying us through this journey.

JTA) — A Belgian daily is under fire for a cartoon that critics say refers to the Orthodox Jewish neighborhood of Antwerp as “coronavirus village.”
 The August 7 drawing in Le Soir by artist Pierre Kroll, who has fought off allegations of anti-Semitism for several previous drawings, shows a tourist bus under the title “Go Visit Antwerp.” An Orthodox Jewish man is cycling nearby without wearing a face mask, several of which are seen on the ground around the bus. A speech balloon above the bus driver reads: “After the zoo, we’ll go tour ‘Coronavirus Village’.”
 Richard Kennigsman, a well-known Jewish-Belgian satirist, wrote on Facebook that while has “not called Kroll an anti-Semite, his painting may be considered as such.”
 Joel Rubinfeld, the president of the Belgian League Against Anti-Semitism, said the caricature “again shows that Kroll obsessively returns to Jews in his works.” The August 7 caricature is “subtle in comparison to previous Kroll works,” Rubinfeld added, including one of a lavishly dressed Jewish diamond dealer smiling while visiting the tax office amid unhappy and poor visitors.

Barbara Almstead StoughtonBarbara Jane Almstead Stoughton, 90, of Midland, Michigan passed on into the infinite Monday, August 3rd, 2020, surrounded by all her remaining immediate family.Barb, as most called her, was born to the late Morris Joseph and Anna Jane (Holden) Almstead in Lakeview, Ohio on October 9, in 1929 and was mostly raised in Syracuse and Skaneateles, New York, where she graduated from Skaneateles High School in 1947 before moving on to get her degree in Radio Broadcasting from Stevens College in Columbia, Missouri. She married the late Dr. Clinton S. Burhans, Jr. in 1949 and traveled extensively with him to Scotland, England, Wales, and Germany before spending much of 1952 as "Miss Melody," host of a popular radio show on TFK/Armed Forces Radio Service at Keflavik, Iceland that was heard by all at the US Naval Air base there, Icelandic residents, and all the ships at sea in the North Atlantic.Upon return to the States, Barb and husband Clint (now teaching at the University of British Columbia at Vancouver, Canada) and began to raise a family, which continued with their move to Michigan State University and Eaton Rapids, Michigan. There they survived the sixties with style, but their marriage did not.

Clemens, Michigan. Bud was a good man and a great father to all and was one of the best things ever to happen to Barb and the rest of the family.Barb and family moved to Midland, Michigan in 1978, where she went on to be the receptionist at top Midland law firm Currie and Kendall, where she became both the "Mother Superior [and the one who] kept the lawyers in line for decades at C &amp; K" (Fred Rolf Esq.) until retiring in 1997. During this period, she continued as a writer of many published articles in books and magazines.Barbara, always caring more for family, friends, and colleagues than about herself, was the beloved mother of four who raised five and was predeceased by both husbands, Bronwen (Burhans) McKenzie, (1955-2020), and Jeffery Lee Burhans (1962-2015).Barb is survived by her brother, James Lee Almstead, his wife Janice (Ozark) Almstead, their son Neil Gregory Almstead, daughter Elizabeth Leigh (Almstead) Elmer and several nieces and nephews, son- in-law James McKenzie, son Clinton Searles Burhans III (1957) and his wife Rebecca Zeiss, son Michael Remington Burhans (1959) and his children Shelby and Kayleigh Burhans, grandson Dylan Michael Burhans (born to Clinton III and first wife Beth Brisbay 1988), raised by Barbara as her fourth son.Barbara Jane Almstead Stoughton has met the challenges of the hard world of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries for her family and herself relentlessly and done so with beauty, grace, style, humility, humor, and love. She now returns her matter to stardust and her energy to the infinite flow.As per her wishes, cremation has taken place. Due to Covid-19, there will be no public memorial service. Plans are made for interment at the Midland Cemetery, next to her beloved Bud Stoughton.

"We are expecting to see an increase in the number of students enrolled in the program during the 2020-21 school year, as many families across the area are still trying to get back on their feet due to circumstances caused by COVID-19," said Sue Theon, social worker and program co-coordinator. "This grant from the Wayne County Community Endowment Fund will help us to immediately support more students in the program."   Students enrolled in the Backpack Program receive food on Fridays, and items include kid-friendly food that students can eat with little or no preparation while also being light to carry. During the school year, elementary students receive the bags of food in their backpacks at the end of the day to take home, and middle and high school students pick up their bags of food on the way out of the buildings after dismissal.   "The program is free, confidential and optional, and focuses on assisting students who may be food insecure," said Heather Keenan, teaching assistant and program co-coordinator. "Good nutrition is critical to good health and success at school. Children who don't get enough to eat often have trouble concentrating."   The cost to supply one student with backpack food during the school year is $100. The program was made possible this past year with support from the Gananda Education Foundation.

Thirdly, there have been profound changes inside Turkey, most especially the dominance of the political scene by the AKP since 2002 but also the country’s emergence as a serious economic power, at least in its more immediate region. In contrast to its mainly Kemalist predecessors, the AKP embraces Turkey’s middle eastern and Islamist (or at least Sunni or MB) character. This has given an ideological flavour to Turkey’s external conduct, associated with the thinking of the now out-of-favour but formerly foreign and then prime minister, Ahmet Davutoglu. This ideology rejects Kemalism’s aloofness from the region’s affairs, and also rejects its distancing from the region’s shared Ottoman past. Its neighbourhood, in which Turkey is seen as a ‘central’ rather than a ‘peripheral’ component, is now regarded as Turkey’s economic, security, cultural and historical ‘near abroad’, a region in which it is bound to engage actively – although it cannot be said that Turkey’s neighbours necessarily hold such fond memories of the Ottoman era. The AKP’s cultural differentiation from, and even aggression towards, the west is part of this ideological shift. Furthermore, domestic political developments have pushed the AKP towards an alliance with the nationalistic MHP, which has long championed a revisionist, militarised, assertive and self-reliant approach to Turkey’s external relations. A ‘Eurasianist’ strand of thinking has also found favour, at least with President Erdogan, which further helps push Ankara towards Russia and Asia and away from the west. Furthermore, MB sympathies have put Turkey at odds with many of its Muslim neighbours, most notably the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Egypt. Turkey now resembles a revisionist or even irredentist country that seeks its ‘place in the sun’ – that is, one that demands and expects a place at the diplomatic top table and that its interests and perspectives be taken into account. It has little commitment to an existing order that has ridden roughshod over its concerns and that fails to reflect its preferences. The expansive ‘Blue Homeland’ maritime doctrine reflects this thinking, as does the occasional ranting over the injustices of the Treaties of Sevres and Lausanne.

 Monitoring public social media posts for similar plans this weekend will let police and other city agencies quickly respond before commercial areas become targets, Lightfoot said.

It was an unforgettable scene for those who watched the 1968 Summer Olympics. John Stephen Ahkwari represented his country, Tanzania, in the marathon event.
 Halfway into the race there was jockeying for position among some runners on the track. As a result, Ahkwari fell, gashed his knee and dislocated it. Many assumed he would pull out to seek medical help, but instead he painfully plodded along.
 An hour after the winner crossed the finish line, Ahkwari did too. He was met by a few thousand spectators who remained in the stadium to cheer him on as he persevered to the finish.
 When asked why he carried on, Ahkwari’s response was, “My country didn’t send me 5,000 miles to start the race, they sent me 5,000 miles to finish it.”
 Wow. What an incredible display of courage and consistency in the face of adversity.
 That’s the kind of spirit the early believers had, too. When the church began in the upper room there were only 120 brave believers. One hundred years later, there were only 10,000 among the 60 million people in the Roman Empire.
 It was slow going and difficult. These people were harassed, imprisoned, persecuted and many martyred. Yet, they lived with a strong faith that wouldn’t quit. Was it worth it? Yes. Today, there are over two billion Christians worldwide.
 It’s not a lack of difficulty but a quality of faith that enables God to do rewarding works through each of us.
 In 1 Kings 17, we see Elijah modeled a quality of faith that produced rich rewards in the life of a widow from Sidon. She had trusted God before, and He sustained her and her son through a famine. But now she meets another crisis — her son becomes ill and dies. She said to Elijah, “What do you have against me, man of God? Did you come to remind me of my sin and kill my son?” She was understandably frustrated and it led to false perceptions about Elijah and his God. But Elijah didn’t scold her or belittle her; he prayed for an answer. Elijah knew that man’s frustrations are often God’s best platforms.
 Elijah calmly demonstrated how faith often must overcome frustration through persevering action.
 He stretched himself out on the boy three times and cried out to the Lord, “Lord, my God, let this boy’s life return to him!” Elijah acted not once or twice but three times before he saw results. Faith has to stay alive long enough to possess what God knows is possible.
 Elijah also convinced the woman the worth of faith is worth its work.
 Can you imagine the joy the mother felt when life returned to her son? She said to Elijah, “Now I know that you are a man of God and that the word of the Lord from your mouth is the truth.” God promised us faith will always bring forth victory in some way because it’s empowered by His goodness. But it does require staying strong throughout the battle. Like Ahkwari, we need to stay strong so we see finishing in faith is way better than just starting.
