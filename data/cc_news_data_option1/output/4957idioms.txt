The stock market has more often than not ended up being extremely baffling, catching even some of the more experienced traders by surprise. It happens that even when results are as projected, the market sometimes just takes a sudden turn towards the opposite direction. Often such events lead to doubt and much speculation. At such time, it may pay to keep tabs on a stock's historical price performance. Useful also would be knowledge of the stock's trends, both the short term and long-term. Artelo Biosciences Inc.

Adds Senate Democratic leader Schumer)
 By Richard Cowan and Patricia Zengerle
 WASHINGTON, Dec 1 (Reuters) - The U.S. Congress should include a fresh wave of coronavirus stimulus in a must-pass $1.4 trillion spending bill aimed at heading off a government shutdown in the midst of a pandemic, top Senate Republican Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday.
 After a monthslong standoff between Republicans and Democrats that persisted as COVID-19 infections and deaths soared, lawmakers put forth a flurry of proposals in an attempt to pass something this month.
 Both McConnell and President-elect Joe Biden separately spoke of passing a coronavirus aid bill quickly and debating an additional bill early next year to address the worst U.S. health crisis in living memory.
 But difficult talks over details remained with little time to spare, as Congress rushes to pass a $1.4 trillion bill by Dec. 11 to keep government agencies funded. Without action, a range of government programs would be interrupted and many federal workers would be furloughed.
 MCCONNELL PUSHES 'TARGETED RELIEF'
 McConnell said he would like to marry the funding bill with a coronavirus aid measure.
 "We need a targeted relief bill" now, McConnell told reporters after meeting with his fellow Republican senators. For months he has been pushing a $500 billion approach that Democrats rejected as insufficient.
 McConnell also said that he consulted with the White House and was circulating to Republican senators the outline of a bill that President Donald Trump would accept. McConnell did not provide details.
 McConnell's outline is very close to the legislation that the Senate leader has been touting for months and was rejected by Democrats, according to one Senate Republican source. The plan includes $332.7 billion in new loans or grants to small businesses, according to a document provided to Reuters.
 Meanwhile, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi delivered to McConnell new ideas for reaching a compromise. Schumer refused to provide details during a press conference.
 Schumer called it "a private proposal to help us move the ball forward," as he accused McConnell of maneuvering to bring a partisan, Republican bill up for a vote instead of incorporating Democratic ideas.
 Previously, Schumer and Pelosi sought a $2.2 trillion bill that McConnell rejected.
 THIRD WAY PROPOSED
 Earlier on Tuesday, yet another plan was floated by a bipartisan group of senators and House members seeking $908 billion in a range of COVID-19 relief measures.
 It would set new emergency assistance for small businesses, unemployed people, airlines and other industries during the pandemic.
 It comes with the backing of a group of conservatives and moderates who claim it will appeal to a broad swath of Congress.
 Earlier this year, over $3 trillion in coronavirus aid was enacted, which included economic stimulus measures and money for medical supplies.
 Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski urged quick action on the bipartisan plan as she ticked off business closures mushrooming in her state of Alaska "during a pretty dark and cold time of year," with many suffering job losses and food insecurity.
 This third proposal would provide emergency aid through March 31, including $228 billion in additional Paycheck Protection Program funds for hotels, restaurants and other small businesses.
 State and local governments would receive direct aid under the bipartisan bill, a central demand by Pelosi and her fellow Democrats to prevent layoffs of front-line workers.
 U.S. airlines would receive $17 billion for four months of payroll support as part of $45 billion for the U.S. transportation sector that also includes airports, buses and the Amtrak passenger railroad, according to two people familiar with the plan.
 The measure includes provisions that Republicans have been pressing for, including new liability protections for businesses and schools grappling with the coronavirus pandemic.
 But it is far more expensive than the $500 billion that McConnell has been advocating.
 A compromise $300 per week for four months in additional, unemployment benefits would also be in the package, according to the lawmakers. Democrats had been seeking $600.
 Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin were expected to discuss coronavirus aid and the must-pass government funding bill on Tuesday.

 The Colorado Rockies chose not to offer 2021 contracts Wednesday to oft- injured outfielder David Dahl, catcher Tony Wolters and right-hander Chi Chi Gonzalez.
 The moves came a day after the Rockies agreed to one-year deals with catcher Elias Diaz and right-hander Jairo Diaz, two other players who were eligible for salary arbitration.
 The 26-year-old Dahl is recovering from right shoulder surgery in September, his latest setback. In 2015, he had his spleen removed after running into an outfield wall in the minors. A rib cage injury sidelined him in 2017. In 2018, he missed two months with a broken right foot.
 Even his breakout season in 2019 was marred by injury. After making the NL All-Star team, Dahl injured his right ankle and didn't play after Aug. 2. He appeared in a career-high 100 games that season, hitting .302 with 16 homers and 61 RBIs.
 This year, Dahl played in 24 of 60 games during the pandemic-shortened season and had just 99 plate appearances, hitting .183 with no home runs, two doubles and two triples.

"If a person is willing to be more compliant with a shorter quarantine, they may also be more willing to share the names of potential contacts," Brooks said at the news briefing.
 CDC scientists calculated that for people discontinuing quarantine after seven days, the "residual post-quarantine transmission risk" is about 5%, with an upper limit of 12%, Brooks said. That risk drops to about 1% for those who quarantine for 10 days under the new guidance, with an upper limit of 10%, he said.
 Two prominent infectious-disease experts welcomed the news of the revised guidance Wednesday.
 "Behind the scenes, many of us had been urging the CDC to move forward with this because I think it's in the best interest of public health, and it's in the best interest of the economy, and it's in the best interest of the mental health of people who have to be quarantined," said William Schaffner, a professor of infectious-disease at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center. "This is a win all around."
 Health-care workers and nursing home residents should be the first to get coronavirus vaccines, CDC advisory group says
 Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, also welcomed the revision in the CDC guideline, saying it will focus on the period in which most people exposed to the virus are most likely to become contagious. Right now, she said, contact-tracing efforts are hindered by "deep disincentives" for people to quarantine.
 "A seven or ten-day quarantine recommendation may be easier for people to bear and hopefully may help get more contacts of cases to comply and better enable efforts to stop transmission of the virus," Nuzzo said Wednesday in an email.
 Quarantines apply to people who have been exposed to the virus but have no confirmed infection or illness. The goal is to separate those people from the rest of the population to prevent them from spreading the virus in case they are in infected.
 The virus incubates at a leisurely pace. Symptoms may not appear for many days or even two weeks, and in rare cases even longer. People can become infectious to others one or two days before symptoms appear.
 What makes this pandemic even more difficult to contain is that 20% to 40% of people who are infected never develop symptoms yet potentially are still capable of transmitting the virus to others, according to the CDC.

BRUSELAS La Comisión Europea y la Presidencia alemana del Consejo de la Unión Europea explorarán todas las opciones posibles para sortear el veto de Hungría y Polonia al plan de recuperación europeo, lo que podría pasar por poner en marcha el Fondo de Reconstrucción sin estos dos países.
 “Tenemos que trabajar intensamente y explorar todas las opciones posibles para asegurar que avanzamos porque estamos en una profunda crisis económica, de modo que este dinero es muy necesario”, dijo el vicepresidente de la Comisión Europea, Valdis Dombrovskis, en rueda de prensa tras una reunión telemática de ministros de Economía y Finanzas comunitarios.
 El político letón destacó que 25 de los 27 países de la UE están de acuerdo con condicionar las ayudas del próximo presupuesto comunitario 2021-2027 y del Fondo de Recuperación al Estado de Derecho, mientras que solo dos tienen reservas.
 Hungría y Polonia, expedientadas por sus problemas con el Estado de Derecho, mantienen desde hace días bloqueado el acuerdo sobre el paquete de recuperación (1,8 billones de euros en total) por su rechazo al mecanismo que permitirá suspender fondos a quienes no respeten esos principios.
 El ministro de Finanzas alemán, Olaf Scholz, cuyo país preside este semestre el Consejo de la UE y lidera las conversaciones para sortear el veto, dijo que “a pesar de las dificultades” harán lo posible para evitar tener que debatir sobre un plan b.
 Scholz, quien se mostró “seguro” de que podrán tener un acuerdo “pronto”, insistió en que todos los estados se beneficiarán del plan de recuperación y en que la UE da una “importancia primordial del Estado de Derecho”, y tendrán que conjugarse ambos elementos.
 “Habrá que llegar a resolver esto. Los preparativos están en marcha y no creo que nadie sea tan insensato como para impedir un acuerdo”, consideró. efe

CHARLESTON — Charleston Police Chief Tyke Hunt said Wednesday evening the city police officer shot by a resident Tuesday afternoon will not survive.
 Officer Cassie Johnson, 28, is not expected to survive the wounds suffered from the shooting, which happened on Garrison Avenue just before 3 p.m. Tuesday.
 “With a heavy heart, I hate to say she is not going to be able to pull through this,” Hunt said outside of Charleston Area Medical Center General Hospital. “She is still fighting but her body is unable to sustain life by itself.”
 Johnson was responding to a traffic complaint on Garrison Avenue when Joshua Phillips, 38, of Charleston, allegedly shot her in the face, said Kanawha County Sheriff Mike Rutherford. The Kanawha County Sheriff’s Office believes Johnson also shot Phillips, which sent him to CAMC General.
 Hunt said there was no update on Phillips’ condition as of Wednesday evening, except he was recovering in the hospital.
 Rutherford said the sheriff’s office is currently handling the investigation. He said a confrontation on Garrison Avenue led to the shooting, but declined to comment further until witness statements and evidence collection can be completed.
 “Once that’s finished we will turn our information over to the Charleston Police Department and the Kanawha County Prosecutor’s Office and they will determine what charges (will be filed against Phillips),” Rutherford said.

Claypool measured in at 6’4” with 32.5” arms at the NFL combine. When he doesn’t high-point the ball, or extend his arms and catch it at its peak, he takes his advantageous, long frame completely out of the picture. By letting the ball come to his chest, he allows talented cornerback, Marcus Peters, to get his hand in and knock the ball away. If he catches this at its highest point like we’ve seen him do on numerous other occasions, Peters is swatting his biceps instead of the ball and the Steelers offense is off to the races instead of a three-and-out to start the game.

Embattled Augusta Fire Chief Chris James is on the way out.
   
 James agreed to take paid leave through Aug. 31 in exchange for immediately tendering his resignation, effective Aug. 31, and waiving liability for other severance pay or claims.
   
 James will keep his pension, and his resignation covers his separate role as Richmond County's Emergency Management Agency director, a mayoral appointment.
   
 After nearly three hours behind closed doors, the Augusta Commission voted 7-3 on Tuesday to accept the separation agreement with James, who has been fire chief and EMA director since 2012. Commissioners Sammie Sias, Bill Fennoy and Dennis Williams voted no.
   
 The move follows a critical study of fire operations done by an outside group. McGrath Consulting Group reported in October that the department of more than 300 lacked a chain of command, and most of those it interviewed said morale had "never been lower" under James' leadership in recent months.
   
 The review said the department's 15.4% turnover rate was almost twice the national average and called for the city to begin tracking firings and resignations and bring in a human resources specialist to deal with rampant personnel issues.
   
 Last month, the Augusta Commission accepted the recommendations but took no specific action regarding the chief.
   
 James has been the target of the local firefighters' union for years. The group, which is not recognized by the city, has been critical of his leadership, including concerns about COVID-19 safety. A former firefighter, Michael Tomaszewski, battled with department attorney Jody Smitherman for months to obtain documents about staffing and maintenance that were public record.
   
 James and some commissioners have said the union, which is largely white, is simply being racist toward the chief, who is African American.
   
 In September, former city EMS chief James Kelly sent commissioners a letter alleging that James subjected him to discrimination and hostility because he is gay. James denied the allegations.
   
 James did not answer a message seeking comment.
   
 Two commissioners who supported his resignation said it was the right thing for the city.
   
 "I think there's just been a lot of evidence pointing to the need for change at the leadership level. The constant reports from the rank and file to the report that was done," Commissioner Brandon Garrett said. "All pointed to problems at the top. I think that enough commissioners were finally able to see the problems."
   
 Commissioner Marion Williams said James made the mistake of playing politics over fighting fires and that it was too late for him to change.
   
 "The best thing I can say is it's good for the city, it's good for the fire department and it's good for Chief James," Williams said. "If he did everything right from now on, it would not change the outcome."
   
 Williams said James took direction from certain commissioners, who supported him to the end.
   
 Sias had been a driver behind James' longstanding push to create a city EMS department to replace the contract it has with private provider Gold Cross. The city's use of three ambulances got a poor review in the study, and the commission recently voted to suspend the service.
   
 "They've been pushing him and he listened to him and now he's got himself in a crack," Williams said. "He should have left the politics alone."
   
 Commissioner Dennis Williams said the commission decision wasn't fair to James.
   
 "I don't think he has done anything wrong. Even with the assessment, we had accepted the assessment and decided we were going to go through with the changes," Williams said. "Then all of the sudden we walked in the office yesterday, and it was to terminate the chief. He wasn't given the opportunity that we said we would give him."
   
 James was named acting chief in 2011 after several of the department's top brass -- including former Chief Howard Willis, his two deputy chiefs and Willis' brother -- were encouraged to resign amid misconduct investigations. The firefighters' union was also highly critical of Willis, who was white.
   
 Willis had held the post since 2005, when former Chief Al Gillespie left after three years for another job. Gillespie replaced Bernard Mack, who lasted three months after replacing Ronnie Few, the city's first Black chief, who served for three years.

Los alcaldes de A Coruña, Cambre, Culleredo y Arteixo celebran la reapertura de la hosteleria, que anuncio ayer la Xunta, aunque piden un "esfuerzo extra a los ciudadanos para cumplir las normas y entre todos derrotar este virus". Son las palabras de la alcaldesa de A Coruña, Ines Rey, que entiende que la decision del Ejecutivo gallego es "una buena noticia para la hosteleria, ya que puedes poner un respiro en un momento muy dificil para el sector". La recuperacion de la actividad del sector hostelero, que podra abrir mañana hasta las once de la noche, es para Ines Rey algo positivo para un sector "que ha demostrado ser responsable con las medidas sanitarias". El Concello de Arteixo, al que tambien afectan estas nuevas medidas, aplaude esta "vuelta a la normalidad" sobre todo porque "las familias estaban teniendo unas consecuencias economicas negativas", opina Carlos Calvelo. "Pedimos un comportamiento civico de la gente par evitar una subida de casos", añade.

"Conviene recordar que seguimos en plena incidencia de la pandemia y por eso nuestro municipio, al igual que la ciudad y el resto del cinturon metropolitano, va a seguir con restricciones de movilidad", aclara, a la vez que señala que la reapertura de la hosteleria "es un pequeño alivio para el sector". "Ahora cualquier paso en falso y vuelta atras seria un golpe duro tanto para los negocios como a nivel emocional para los ciudadanos", recuerda. El alcalde de Cambre, Óscar Garcia Patiño, analiza que esta medida llega justo a tiempo: "La epoca de Navidad es fundamental para todos los hosteleros". Invita a los vecinos, ademas, a "seguir cumpliendo las medidas de prevencion".

But since joining the EU in 2007, Bucharest has wound down subsidies for the loss-making coal sector and production has plummeted from 22 million tonnes in 1992 to just 600,000 tonnes last year.
 The Jiu Valley now counts just 4,500 miners down from some 54,000 in 1990.
 Alin Udvar, manager of the Lonea mine, expects the last ton of coal to be extracted as soon as 2024.
 While he hopes that some of his 543 employees will then be transferred to neighbouring sites, they are scheduled to close in 2030.
 Udvar echoes Liviu in giving one of the main attractions of the profession: "You become a miner to retire early."
 In Romania, one of the EU's poorest countries, a miner with 20 years experience receives a pension of 4,000 lei (830 euros or $1,000), almost 10 per cent more than a miner's average salary.
 But there is a high price to pay. According to Udvar, the average life expectancy for the men of the Jiu Valley is around 55 years.
 "I wouldn't hire my 18-year-old boy in the mine for all the money in the world. This job is hard, dangerous and eats away at your health," 44-year-old miner Ferenc Balog told AFP at the end of his shift, his face covered in coal dust.
 "There are no options here for young people other than emigration."
 According to a study carried out by PwC auditors, the region's population has fallen from around 170,000 inhabitants in 1997 to 133,00 last year.
 Breathless due to silicosis, a lung disease that decimates miners, 63-year-old Petre Brait says he covered up his bad health when he was younger to keep going down the mine.
 "I had no choice, my children were still small," he says.
 But now he knows that there is no future for mining.
 "Romania must reduce emissions, it cannot continue to move against the grain," he says.
 \- 'A healthy future' -
 Danut Buhaescu, mayor of another town in the valley, Uricani, criticises successive governments for "lying" about the future of mining, without preparing the area for the industry's disappearance.

The economic impact of playing football behind closed doors on teams outside the English Premier League has been devastating. Whilst teams in the Premier League are cushioned by the television revenues they receive, smaller clubs are largely reliant on gate receipts from season ticket and on-the-day turnstile sales plus the commercial revenue from concessions at the stadium. The fear is that teams will be financially unable to continue. Despite this, our research suggests that there should be extreme caution in allowing fans to return to matches. While there is evidence that fans socially distance voluntarily, our findings suggest that the standard way in which fans congregate to attend matches can facilitate the spread of the virus, even if capacity utilisation in the stadium is low. Certainly, fans will need to act in a more cautious manner in future whilst attending matches. Government pilots to let fans back in had tentatively begun in England but have been hampered by national and local restrictions being introduced. If these pilots are to restart, they will need to be closely monitored to see whether spreading fans out across stadiums and timing of entry into the stadium can effectively prevent the spread of the virus spread.

“What they’re doing offensively makes a little more sense to you than just watching straight football.”
 That was Cramsey’s good Saturday.
 The next one?
 “Unfortunately, it was Christmas decorations day,” he said.
 Then, there’s Lambert, who watches games differently than most coaches. That’s because he started Charlotte’s football program from scratch.
 “When you start a program and start a football team from zero,” said Lambert, “you really watch the game a lot differently. Not just the football part of it, but I always say things like, ‘who picked that uniform?’ and ‘how did you come up with that?’ Because you had to do that, you had to decide. All those things that you never would do as a coach, you had to do as a start-up.
 “I enjoy watching college football on Saturday. I have two boys and we enjoy watching it together. Of course, I get a lot of input at home on how we do things at Marshall. They tell me what I do wrong all the time. So, that is always fun.”
 The other phase Lambert likes to watch is game management.
 “How do people handle timeouts at the end of halves, at the end of games?” said Lambert. “You can always learn as a coach. Like, ‘Man, I don’t know about doing that in that situation.’ And it’s a good time to learn when you’re in a relaxed environment.
 “So, that way, when you’re under pressure on Saturday and you have to make those decisions, you’re more comfortable in those situations. It’s a chance to just go through those things in your mind when you’re just sitting on your couch and don’t have the pressure of the game on you.
 “It’s like, ‘hmmm, that was an interesting decision. Or, probably wouldn’t have done that. Or, that was a good decision.’ Things that you learn from other people are just huge.”
 So, there it is.
 Three different football coaches and three different ways of getting the most out of consecutive off-Saturdays they really didn’t want.

VALDOSTA, Ga. (WALB) - As temperatures drop across South Georgia, Lowndes County officials have a plan for those who need shelter from the cold. They also have some reminders for residents as winter nears.“We have a plan we have been utilizing for several years now,” said Ashley Tye, the Emergency Management Director for Lowndes County.Tye says when temperatures drop, LAMP and the Salvation Army provide shelter. He says they usually meet people’s needs and don’t exceed capacity.But if there was to be a capacity overflow, the county has a backup plan. They will work with churches to provide more shelter and space.He says over the last 8 to 10 years, they’ve only used that plan once or twice.“So, typically anytime it drops below freezing, we implement our plan. And when I say implement, we just touch base with those other locations to make sure they are available,” said Tye.Tye says during the cold months, LAMP and the Salvation Army usually see an increase in visitors but have been able to handle the capacity so far.“When COVID first came out we worked with all of our partners and even in anticipation if we had to open any shelters during hurricane season, what that might look like,” said Tye.All of the shelters have safety guidelines in place; including social distancing, temperature screening upon arrival, and a symptoms questionnaire.They also have isolation rooms if someone has any symptoms. That way they won’t be kicked out or expose anyone.And for those at home weathering the cold, Tye wants to remind everyone about the four Ps.“Typically we stress the four Ps, obviously people. Making sure everybody has shelter. Our pets, we don’t want to forget our pets. Bring them in if possible. If not possible, at least make sure we have somewhere, a house preferably with some blankets or hay or something to provide them some means to get out of the cold. Our plants, make sure we cover up our plants. And any exposed pipes, we definitely want to make sure we don’t have pipes bursting, that creates another emergency itself,” said Tye.People bundled up due to cold weather.Copyright 2020 WALB.

_Georgia records show that Wood has voted in every general election dating back to 2000, in person in 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2014—and then via absentee or mail ballot in 2016, 2018, and 2020. State records also show that Wood has not voted in a Republican primary since 2004, but did request Democrat ballots in the 2006, 2008, 2010, and 2018 primary elections in Georgia. That means that even when Trump was president, in the 2018 midterm elections, Wood requested a Democrat primary ballot in Georgia and voted for Democrats in the primary in the state while Trump was universally backing Republicans there. Wood also did not request primary ballots of either party, the records show, in 2016 or 2020–when Trump was on the ballot in the GOP primary._

 # Emerging beyond pandemic begins with sound leadership
 Will Buss
 The first COVID-19 vaccines are expected by the end of this month, and authorities need to determine who gets the first dose. As our nation attempts to emerge from the coronavirus, we should also consider how our leaders must move this country forward toward a post-pandemic world.
 The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices will decide who will receive the initial vaccinations. This panel of independent advisers to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention met about this earlier this week. They are expected to provide the vaccines to as many of the nation’s physicians, medical professionals, the nation’s 21 million health care workers and the country’s 3 million nursing home residents.
 But the panel has also been deliberating for months about whom should also be included among the more than 6 million doses that could be available by the middle of this month to those hundreds of millions who are considered among the high priority groups, which includes those 53 million Americans who identify as senior citizens, 87 million essential workers and more than 100 million who have medical conditions that place them at high risk for health complications, if they were to contract the virus.
 An estimated 40 million doses could be available for some of these 261 million people. The rest of us will be waiting a few months for a vaccine. Leadership will need to make these crucial decisions.
 Our leaders of the incoming administration will need to set the record straight and undo the damage from the politicization of this pandemic and increasing mistrust for vaccines. These false accusations about vaccines has been called a second pandemic. Such “fake news” will only impede any progress within our nation, which has been struggling to re-emerge socially and economically. CNN has cited that the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies has identified this problem and how governments and institutions need to discuss how to implement plans to combat such misinformation that will inhibit any recovery.
 General acceptance for the coming vaccines has weakened in recent months, as the debate about vaccinations in general has found more supporters among doubters. A recent study from researchers at Johns Hopkins University has found that global acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccines has been in decline. Distrust is also increasing among public health interventions, as still a considerable number of people among Western civilizations have been unwilling to wear face masks.
 Such a mindset is rooted in rumor and unsubstantiated opinions and will only place potentially vulnerable populations in danger, while the rest of us still live our lives in caution. Coronavirus cases have been on the rise across this country, and further denial and ignorance will only permit a second wave. This happened 11 years ago when a second wave of the swine flu struck in Mexico and forced U.S. schools in the south to close early in the spring of 2009.
 School districts, their teachers, staffs, students and their parents have already been stretched psychologically and emotionally during the past seven months, and counting, of this current wave. Parents struggle to teach their children at home as many working adults are forced to stay at home from work, where their jobs have been subject to reduced hours or eliminated. Some are left wondering how they will pay their bills, put food on the table or buy gifts this holiday season.
 But an end is coming. Vaccinations are coming soon. It may not be an immediate solution, but something to build on.
 Until then, we need to continue to practice practical social distancing and common sense before we can ever consider a return to any normalcy. Perhaps we should also be prepared for a new normal. More physicians argue that citizens should wear nose-and-mouth-covering masks and gloves whenever we venture in public.
 This begins with leadership. It must set the tone. The incoming Biden administration may not be able to provide relief soon enough, as the waning days of the current administration and current members of Congress have yet to provide any additional financial relief. Past relief has run out and more is needed.
 Given the recent history, we should err on the side of caution and follow the leaders who have exhibited and distributed proven, trusted and serious leadership. We really need it right now.

ALBANY, Ga. (WALB) - With the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) expected to approve or grant emergency use authorization to multiple COVID-19 vaccines in the coming weeks, Phoebe Putney Memorial Hospital is prepared to begin administering vaccines to eligible populations and expects to play a leading role in the vaccination process in southwest Georgia, the hospital said Wednesday.Phoebe is one of the first organizations in Georgia capable of properly storing and administering what will likely be the first available COVID-19 vaccine, the hospital said. “Pfizer was the first pharmaceutical company to apply for emergency use authorization from the FDA,” said Dr. Marty Kelvas, Phoebe Putney Health System director of pharmacy services. “Their vaccine requires careful storage and must be refrigerated at a temperature of 94 degrees below zero (-70 Celsius). Phoebe invested in an ultra-cold refrigeration system specifically to be prepared to receive doses of this vaccine, and we are currently able to receive, store and safely administer any of the multiple COVID-19 vaccines that may soon be approved for use.”Phoebe has formally applied through the Georgia Department of Public Health (DPH) Immunization Program to serve as an official Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) COVID-19 Vaccination Program Provider. As such, Phoebe expects to receive a significant number of vaccines and will work with community medical providers to coordinate vaccine planning. “We set up a Phoebe vaccine planning team and are leading a COVID-19 vaccine medical task force made up of healthcare providers in the community who may be involved in coordinating vaccinations. We are also working closely with DPH to ensure we are able to quickly and efficiently administer vaccines, once we have them,” said Julie Miller, Phoebe Putney Memorial Hospital emergency preparedness coordinator.While it is unclear how many vaccines Phoebe will receive and when vaccinations will begin, hospital officials said the National Academy of Medicine developed a framework for equitable allocation that Phoebe will follow. “The experts came up with this framework, and the CDC is working on guidelines that will include four phases of vaccine administration to ensure we have the greatest and quickest success in getting this virus under control. We will follow these guidelines and instructions from DPH strictly and scrupulously and depend on the community vaccine medical task force to work out other details to ensure efficient and equitable distribution,” said Dr. William Sewell, Phoebe Putney Memorial Hospital chief medical information officer.Phoebe’s COVID-19 vaccine planning team is currently working on vaccination locations, processes for appointment scheduling and procedures to verify that vaccine recipients fall into the proper vaccination phases. “We want to protect our community by getting as many people vaccinated as quickly as possible under the rules we must follow. We tested ourselves this fall by administering 5,000 flu shots to Phoebe family members in just over a week. We know we can do this. We have a responsibility to do this, and we will be here to serve our communities well through this vitally important process,” said Scott Steiner, Phoebe Putney Health System president and chief executive officer.Phoebe is not only preparing to administer COVID-19 vaccines in Albany but also in Americus and Sylvester, according to the hospital. “This is a system-wide effort. We are coordinating with Phoebe Sumter and Phoebe Worth to ensure whatever allocations we receive for those areas are administered to the people there,” Steiner said.Phoebe will release more details on its COVID-19 vaccination efforts once it receives more information from federal and state government partners, the hospital said. “There are still a lot of questions to be answered, but we want everyone to know our planning has put us ahead of the game. We will be transparent throughout this process, and we look forward to the day when vaccinations can help us beat this virus, once and for all,” Steiner said.Copyright 2020 WALB.

STARKVILLE, Miss.
 Mississippi State coach Nikki McCray-Penson told her players all week leading up to the game against New Orleans that their size would be the difference.
 The No. 6 Bulldogs used the 3-pointer to roll past Jackson State in their opener, but they were clear and concise that they were going to control the paint on Wednesday night. The final product was a 104-51 victory in which Mississippi State dominated every bit of the paint.
 The size advantage led the Bulldogs (2-0) to a 51-16 win in the rebounding column and they outscored the Privateers (1-1) 72-12 in the paint. Jessika Carter led the way with 23 points on 9-of-12 shooting and added 10 rebounds.
 "Obviously, our size played a big factor," McCray-Penson said. "I thought we really dominated the paint which we needed to. Hopefully, it gave (Carter and Yemiyah Morris) some confidence as we continue to play games."
 JaMya Mingo-Young added 18 points on 8-of-9 shooting and had eight rebounds and five assists. Rickea Jackson scored 16 points, and Morris had 14.

The stock market has more often than not ended up being extremely baffling, catching even some of the more experienced traders by surprise. It happens that even when results are as projected, the market sometimes just takes a sudden turn towards the opposite direction. Often such events lead to doubt and much speculation. At such time, it may pay to keep tabs on a stock's historical price performance. Useful also would be knowledge of the stock's trends, both the short term and long-term. Citizens Financial Group Inc. (NYSE: CFG) share prices have increased by 1.11% over the past week, but are up 28.47% over prices posted in the last quarter. Going further back, the stock's price has tanked 25.35% over the last 6 months but is down -17.21% in year-to-date trading.

“When I completed the glucose tolerance test, I was definitely shocked, even though I have diabetes in my family,” the _Bachelor_ alum told RD Lounge in January 2018. “I should have thought to myself that it could happen, but I really didn’t think about it. But it wasn’t a shock that I couldn’t handle, especially because I had a meeting with a registered dietitian nutritionist almost immediately after my diagnosis. I was able to control it through diet and exercise. I didn’t have to get insulin shots or medication. I really did feel like I could get a handle on it.”

"I mean, the leader has to create that environment for this to happen, and then, if you've done your research and you're fully invested, it's up to you to gather those clues, gather those discoveries and put them in the soup and make it something unimaginable, something that you can only create when you're in those situations. And Chris provided that for us," the actor said.
