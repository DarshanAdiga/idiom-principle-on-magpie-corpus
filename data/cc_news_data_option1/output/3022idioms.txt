The bearded Portuguese coach is quickly becoming one of the Premier League’s most respected tacticians.


  He again guided Wolves to a top-seven finish this season, all while juggling a long Europa League campaign (which isn’t over yet) and other cup competitions.


  At one point, it looked very possible that Wolves might make a late surge for the top four, though they ran out of steam a little towards the end of the league campaign.


  Santo, though, has been excellent again, and should continue to take his club forward over the next few years. There may yet be a trophy this season, too, with a Europa League last-16 tie against Olympiacos to come next month.


  17 - José Bordalás (Getafe)


  Getafe’s La Liga season petered out towards the end, but that should take nothing away from the work of Bordalás, who is pushing the small Madrid club well beyond expectations.


  The Azulones were well in the battle for the top four when the campaign restarted after lockdown was lifted in Spain, and that in itself is worthy of praise. Their final position of eighth is certainly not a disappointment.


  And Getafe remain in the Europa League, with a meeting against Inter in the last-16. They will be the underdogs for that but Bordalás and his players seem to thrive on being written off.


  16 - Roberto De Zerbi (Sassuolo)


  De Zerbi is doing impressive things with modest resources at Sassuolo. The Neroverdi have been in excellent form post-lockdown, surging up to eighth in Serie A with two games to play.


  And they have done it in style, playing an attack-minded brand of football with a focus on positional play. Sassuolo don’t take the cautious approach, even when faced with Italy’s biggest clubs. A 3-3 draw against Juventus earlier this month was evidence of that.


  De Zerbi is an exciting young manager, and certainly one to keep an eye on over the next few years.


  15 - Julien Stéphan (Rennes)


  Stéphan has made history at Rennes. The cancellation of the Ligue 1 season meant a third-placed finish on points per game, and qualification for the Champions League for the first time in the club’s history.


  Rennes will have to go through a qualification round but after their progress this season they will be confident of coming through it.


  For Stéphan, it has been an almost perfect start to his project. The 39-year- old finished tenth in the 2018/19 season with Rennes, but rapid improvement meant they were able to reach Ligue 1’s top three just a year on.


  He is another young coach surpassing expectations.

Vern Pottinger may be the most revered football coach in NIC-10 history.


   


  But before Pottinger led Belvidere to two state titles, three state title games and 11 playoff appearances, the Bucs were just 15-30 in his first five seasons.


   


  And then Mike Junkin, the son of a United Airlines pilot, moved to Belvidere.


   


  "He was one of the players who taught us how to hit," Pottinger said. "He was there in the early years, when we hadn't established much. Our receivers on the scout team didn't want to run over the middle where he was."


   


  "No chance," said former assistant coach Curt Tobin. "They didn't want anything to do with that, I guarantee it."


   


  "He was just so intense," Pottinger added. "He wasn't real big, but he was so intense, anywhere from the weight room to the practice field. He was a tremendously intense player."


   


  He was also the only area first-round draft pick in any of the three major professional sports. And his 513 tackles at Duke from 1983-86 are 129 more than East's Brock Spack at Purdue to easily rank as the most tackles by any area Division I college player. At all three levels, Junkin ranks as one of the best players in Rockford area history and comes in at No. 9 on our all- time list of greatest football players.


   


  "He was as good as you could find," former Hononegah coach Donn VanSchelven said, comparing Junkin to Pete Bercich, a five-year pro with the Minnesota Vikings who starred at Notre Dame as well as the New Lenox Providence team that beat Hononegah in the 1987 IHSA playoffs. "Junkin could cover a lot of ground. And he was a sure tackler. That was his No. 1 strength.


   


  "We always had guys who broke tackles. We couldn't break any tackles against him. He was like Pete Bercich."


   


  Junkin was so good at Duke that the Cleveland Browns traded up to pick the second-team All-American middle linebacker at No. 5 overall in the 1987 NFL draft.


   


  "Of all the linebackers I have had the chance to evaluate, Mike Junkin is one of the very best I've seen," coach Marty Schottenheimer, who was in his 14th season as an NFL coach, said at the time. "In my mind, he's going to be a very effective (pass) rusher for us. He has a tremendous knack for getting to the football."


   


  Junkin is now remembered as one of the worst draft busts in Browns history, playing only two years in Cleveland before being traded to Kansas City -- where Schottenheimer had moved on to coach -- by Ernie Accorsi, the same GM who traded John Elway from the Colts to the Broncos on draft day. But that may be unfair. For starters, the Browns tried to turn a middle linebacker tackling machine into an outside linebacker pass rusher, a role most NFL teams said he was unsuited for. Also, he had bad luck with injuries. Junkin ended his rookie season on the injured reserve list with a wrist injury. His second season in Cleveland he was hampered by a knee injury. In his final NFL season in Kansas City in 1989, he was sidelined by first an ankle injury and then one to his shoulder.


   


  "I don't think they made a mistake drafting Mike at that spot," said Tobin, who coached Belvidere's receivers and special teams at the time. "Mike just ran into some injuries. Those injuries many times are career ending. Even though Mike could play through them, he never really was the same."


   


  "Michael had a couple of injuries he couldn't come back from," Tom Sternquist, who coached Belvidere's linebackers, defensive ends and offensive linemen at the time. "You can't take a beating like that in the pros. Those people will sniff you out and find you."


   


  In high school, Junkin helped Belvidere find its winning ways. The Bucs went 6-3 his senior year for their best record in eight years. The year after that, they began their string of 11 playoff seasons in 12 years.


   


  "We knew who he was when he came to town," Pottinger said of Junkin, who moved to Belvidere as a sophomore and had an older brother, Trey, who played 19 years in the NFL as a long snapper and special teams player. "He wasn't very big, but he had an older brother who was playing at Louisiana Tech. Mike was real small, but we didn't mind small players."


   


  Belvidere was especially famous for utilizing small nose guards on the defensive line. Rob Anderson started at nose guard for Belvidere's 14-0 Class 5A state champs in 1993 then won the 119-pound state wrestling title that winter. And 112-pound state champ Rafael Avila started at defensive back. The year before, 125-pound state champ Nick Cina was leading the Bucs in rushing before he broke his leg halfway through the season.


   


  "When I talked to the Chicago Tribune for the starting lineups," Pottinger said of the 1993 state final preview, "I had Rob listed at 128. They said, 'You mean 188.' I said, no. They said, 'Well, I don't believe you.' I told them to watch the game and you will see."


   


  Those who watched Junkin play for Belvidere saw a 6-foot-3, 190-pound linebacker and offensive guard who looked skinny but didn't play that way.


   


  "He was all arms and legs, a big lanky kid," said Sternquist, who coached him on both sides of the ball. "He wasn't muscular until he went to Duke and started pumping iron. But he was lanky-strong. He wasn't all skin-and-bone. He had muscle to him."


   


  Junkin also had toughness, smarts and a nose for the ball.


   


  "He had great speed, great lateral movement -- and of course he could hit," Tobin said.


   


  Junkin even showed that on offense.


   


  "What I remember about Mike most on offense is that whenever we got down to the goal line or in a short yardage situation, I liked to go on the first sound," Pottinger said. "One time somebody on defense yelled something out and Mike took the defensive player all the way back to the end zone before the ball ever got snapped."


   


  In Junkin's final high school game, Belvidere upset Freeport 25-16 to keep the Pretzels out of the playoffs. Freeport's only other loss that season was to undefeated Class 5A state champion Guilford. Junkin dominated on both sides that day, despite being asked to block Freeport's all-conference defensive lineman Jeff Christensen.


   


  "We graded him out at 98% on defense and 94% on offense, meaning he won his block 94% of the time against an all-conference player," Sternquist said. "I mean, who does that? I know I never did."

The National Green Tribunal has rapped the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) over compliance of conditions mentioned in environmental clearances granted for projects, saying the mechanism for monitoring environmental norms is inadequate.


  The green panel said compliance of conditions of environmental clearance must be monitored on periodical basis, atleast once in a quarter.


  A bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice A K Goel said there is poor monitoring and there are huge gaps in laying down of conditions and its enforcement.


  It asked the Environment Ministry to review and strengthen the mechanism for the purpose.


  The tribunal took note of an affidavit filed by the ministry which mentioned that there are certain proposals to strengthen the monitoring mechanism.


  The NGT said that this only shows insensitivity to the vital constitutional obligation despite repeated directions.


  “Repeated plea of merely having such proposals, without effective enforcement on the ground can hardly be held to be satisfactory. Counsel for the MoEF states that there has been further meaningful steps, after filing of the affidavit but the same could not brought on record.


  “We cannot accept such a statement. If steps have been actually taken, we fail to understand why the same could not be produced atleast during the hearing. We record our dissatisfaction at the attitude of the MoEF on the subject,” the bench said.


  It directed the ministry to take effective steps to discharge its constitutional obligation to advance ‘Precautionary’ and ‘Sustainable Development’ principles and also the ‘Public Trust Doctrine’.


  “We need not repeat the observations with regard to the acknowledged deficiencies in the existing mechanism which urgently needs to be remedied. Let affidavit of compliance be filed before the next date by e-mail,” the bench said.


  The matter is listed for hearing on December 17.


  The directions came when the green panel was hearing a plea moved by petitioner Sandeep Mittal seeking stricter mechanisms to ensure compliance of conditions mentioned in environmental clearances granted for projects.


  Laying down conditions for EC based on appraisal is not enough unless compliance thereof is duly monitored and ensured with a view to achieve the said object, the plea said.

By Sunday, March 1, I really felt as though I was hitting my stride.      I was approaching the six-month mark in my new role and flew home that morning from Belfast, where I had been covering the annual general meeting of football's law-makers the International Football Association Board.      The coronavirus was on our radar then - it was already having a major impact on sport in Asia and in Italy, and FIFA's president Gianni Infantino was asked about it that weekend.      But it still seemed like an abstract concept, and reporters mingled with top administrators from the British Isles and far beyond as they always did at these events. It felt like a great contacts-building exercise, as did UEFA's annual congress in Amsterdam on March 3, which I also covered. UEFA’s executive committee held a meeting the day before - coronavirus was not even on the agenda.      A member of the committee was asked by those of us doorstepping whether it had been discussed as part of 'any other business', and we were told that it had, but for "about two minutes".      Ten days later, professional football in England had been indefinitely postponed. Ten days after that, the UK was in lockdown. World sport went into shutdown.      From that point on, the way sports journalism was done transformed overnight. Old-fashioned networking was out, Zoom calls were in.      I am fairly new to the sports news beat, but speaking to veterans of it, this was the busiest time any of them had ever known.      Normally it's a big story if a governing body at home or international level is in existential crisis - they were now all facing one all at the same time.      My job came to be one of assessing the damage - how much would the elite events lose from broadcast rights and sponsorship if their events could not go ahead?      For those competitions where spectators were all important, how would they survive without match day revenue?      How would Olympic athletes, who taper their preparations exactly to coincide with a summer Games, cope with the fact there was no event until July 2021?      What would a pandemic do to the mental health of footballers in League One and Two of the EFL, out of contract in the summer and with few guarantees of future employment?      Myself and my colleagues tried to answer these questions, and more, as the country entered lockdown. These were the questions that mattered to sports fans, and as employees of the UK and Ireland's national news agency, we felt a duty to provide as much clarity as we could.      PA reporters never rely on being spoon-fed quotes from press conferences, but now more than ever the pressure was on us to chase down interviewees and move on the debate while actual live sport was in hibernation.      As green shoots of hope began to emerge, the questions turned to how could sport safely return?      The PA news agency was the first to get an on-the-record admission from the UK's national football policing lead that playing the remaining matches of the 2019-20 season on a home-and-away basis would "present challenges" for emergency services stretched by the pandemic.      On May 1, two days after that story ran on the PA news service, Premier League clubs were told the only way they could finish the season was if they were all prepared to play it out at eight to 10 neutral venues.      By the time the league restarted on June 17, that position had shifted after further discussions between league, police and Government.      My work does not tend to take me to many live matches, but for my colleagues who do it on a regular basis, it has been a totally different experience since sport restarted.      There are no press rooms to swap gossip with fellow reporters, no mixed zones for follow-ups. Press boxes are socially distanced, face masks are mandatory and manager press conferences take place via video conferencing software.      You arrive an hour before a game and have to leave swiftly afterwards, another challenge for a PA reporter with such extensive filing requirements.      The world will probably never again feel or look exactly like it did on that Sunday morning in Belfast.      But the months since then have demonstrated the agility of the PA sports service, and the resourcefulness and creativity of its editorial staff.

One of the best ways a livestock producer can improve available grass for cattle in pastures is to attend a Management Intensive Grazing school.


  Thousands of producers have attended these schools over the years and most attendees will say it changed the way they think about grazing cattle.


  Another opportunity to attend will be coming to Lamar when the MIG school will occur September 21-23 at the Southwest Center research farm.


  “This three-day school will focus on forage options, fencing and watering systems, pasture fertility, cattle nutrition, grazing management and economics of the MIG system,” University of Missouri field specialist in agronomy Jill Scheidt said.


  The school lasts 9-3:30 p.m. each day and involves hands-on exercises and on- farm tours of operations using the practice. There are seven presenters who will be addressing every aspect of grazing systems. A daily lunch is provided in the registration fee.


  There is a $125 per person fee (discounts for multiples from the same operation) to attend and participants must preregister by Monday, Sep. 14, to reserve their space for the school. In addition to meals, the fee includes printed materials.


  Grazing schools are limited in the state this year due to COVID-19 restrictions. It is important that attendees preregister early since there is a limited number of participants for the class. The planners are working to provide as much social distancing as possible during this three-day school.


  For more information and to preregister, call the University of Missouri Extension off of Barton County at (417) 682-3579.


  Preregistration will only be complete when payment is made. Grazing schools are a joint effort between MU, the Natural Resources Conservation Service and Soil and Water Conservation Districts.

Right turns on red are permitted in many regions of North America. In the United States, western states have allowed it for more than 50 years, and eastern states amended their traffic laws to allow it in the 1970s as a fuel- saving measure in response to motor fuel shortages in 1973. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 required in §362(c)(5) that in order for a state to receive federal assistance in developing mandated conservation programs, they must permit right turns on red lights.


  RTOR is governed federally. The mandate is that RTOR should be allowed to the maximum extent practicable consistent with safety. Thus, unless there is a safety issue determined by engineering judgment, these turns must be allowed.


  All 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, and Puerto Rico have allowed right turns on red since 1980, except where prohibited by a sign or where right turns are controlled by dedicated traffic signals. The few exceptions include New York City, where right turns on red are prohibited, unless a sign indicates otherwise. In some states, including New York, a right turn on red is prohibited when a red arrow is displayed.


  Through most of Canada, a driver may turn right at a red light after coming to a complete stop unless a sign indicates otherwise – same as in NYS. In the province of Quebec, turning right on a red was illegal until a pilot study carried out in 2003 showed that the right turn on red maneuver did not result in significantly more crashes. Subsequent to the study, the Province of Quebec now allows right turns on red except where prohibited by a sign. However, like in New York City, it remains illegal to turn right on a red anywhere on the Island of Montreal. Motorists are reminded of this rule by large signs posted at the entrance to all bridges connecting with the Island of Montreal.

If college football somehow makes it to the field, all we'll get is a shell of a season.


   


  Fewer games. Conference bubbles. A limited number of fans in the stadiums -- or maybe none at all.


   


  Is it really worth risking the health of players, coaches and boosters for this?


   


  The mighty Southeastern Conference, which has produced 10 of the last 14 national champions, delivered the grimmest signal Thursday that this will be a season like no other, if there's actually a season amid a raging pandemic that shows no signs of fading away.


   


  Following drastic moves already instituted by the Big Ten, Pac-12 and Atlantic Coast Conference, the SEC announced a 10-game, conference-only schedule that won't begin until late September. The Big 12 will likely have to follow suit, despite making an aggressive push to play a full, 12-game schedule even as the pool of potential non-league opponents dries up.


   


  The reduced, bubble-like schedules are effectively a Hail Mary to save a season that, frankly, may not be worth saving at this point.


   


  "We're all hoping," was the best Georgia athletic director Greg McGarity could offer, and even then he was quick to add a sobering dose of reality.


   


  He reminded everyone of the Miami Marlins, who were struck with a coronavirus outbreak just days into a baseball season that already had been delayed by nearly four months.


   


  "No one in college football has even practiced yet," McGarity said, as though he was already preparing everyone for a fall without college football. "This is just a date. It's a date we're holding. I sure hope we start then. But as we've seen with professional sports already, this thing can change on a dime."


   


  No sport faces more daunting odds to pull off a season that is relatively free of the highly contagious virus. Football requires the biggest roster. Football demands the most contact. And we're talking about college-age kids who are even more likely than pro athletes (Lou Williams notwithstanding) to scoff at the risk posed by the pandemic, which has already claimed more than 150,000 American lives.


   


  While many schools are planning to offer the bulk of their classes online, football teams will have to be on campus for practice time, film work, endless meetings and, oh yeah, just enough matriculation to at least maintain the appearance of being "student-athletes"


   


  Why do it?


   


  Well, there's the money, of course. While all Football Bowl Subdivision teams will likely have to play in empty stadiums or with greatly downsized crowds, the Power Five leagues are blessed with lucrative television deals that would help athletic departments bolster bottom lines that have been ravaged by economic meltdown.


   


  McGarity offered a more altruistic explanation.


   


  "We have an obligation to try to play," he said. "Whether its volleyball or soccer or football, young people have a three-, four-, five-year window to participate in college sports. We have an obligation to try to make that happen, but it's got to be done in a safe manner. They have to feel like it's safe, and their parents have to feel it's safe. We have to learn to live in the COVID society."


   


  We already knew that college football was prepared to press forward without its glorious intersectional games -- even a storied series such as Notre Dame vs. Southern Cal, which has been put on hold for the first time since World War II.


   


  But the SEC took things a step further with its conference-only scheduling decision, which wiped out any hopes of saving four in-state rivalries against ACC opponents, all traditionally played on the final Saturday of the regular season.


   


  Georgia vs. Georgia Tech. Florida vs. Florida State. South Carolina vs. Clemson. Kentucky vs. Louisville.


   


  All of them, gone.


   


  "As members of the SEC, we're kind of bound by their rules," Florida athletic director Scott Stricklin said. "And right now, they've precluded all non- conference activity in the sport of football for this year. So as difficult as that is for us all in the state of Florida to wrap our minds around, that's where we're going to be for the fall of 2020."


   


  Only a day earlier, the ACC made a transparent attempt to save all four rivalry games, voting for an 11-game schedule that included 10 conference games and one non-league game -- as long as the opponent was from within the state or was willing to play at the ACC stadium.


   


  But the SEC decided there simply wasn't enough weeks in the calendar to get in a 10-game schedule that allowed for one off week, while also leaving another week open ahead of the conference championship game to provide some flexibility in the very real event that games have to be postponed because of the virus.


   


  As it is, the SEC will decide its champion on Dec. 19 -- two weeks later that originally planned, just six days ahead of Christmas, and right up against the College Football Playoff semifinals that are scheduled for New Year's Day.


   


  Still, it was a bitter blow to all involved. Even with all its ills, these are the sort of games that make college football special.


   


  Clemson has faced South Carolina for 111 straight seasons, a streak that began during the Taft administration. Georgia vs. Georgia Tech isn't far behind with its "Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate" rivalry, which has been played every year since 1925.


   


  Clemson athletic director Dan Radakovich said his school "aggressively lobbied the ACC to include an additional non-conference game for the primary purpose of maintaining our long-standing rivalry game with South Carolina. We're disappointed to hear of the scheduling decision announced by the SEC, as we know the importance of the Palmetto Bowl to the state of South Carolina."


   


  McGarity said it hasn't really sunk in that his school won't close the regular season against the Yellow Jackets.


   


  "This pandemic has created so many oddities," the Georgia AD said. "A lot of things are almost out of your control."


   


  Indeed, there's only going to be one true champion this season.


   


  The coronavirus.

London [UK], August 1 (ANI): England cricketer Sam Billings is confident that experience of playing in the Indian Premier League (IPL) will help him pin his place in the England squad in the coming years.   The T20 World Cup slated to be played this year in Australia has been postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic, and now it will go ahead next year either in India or Australia. Also, the 50 over World Cup in 2023 is scheduled to be held in India.   "I think that's something I can potentially offer compared to other players, benefitting from all the different franchise experiences I have had, but specifically the IPL and the relative success I have had on turning pitches in Chennai and Delhi," ESPNcricinfo quoted Billings as saying.   The wicket-keeper batsman feels that experience of playing in the IPL for Chennai and Delhi has improved his game against spin and will help him cement his spot in the England side.   "I back my game against spin and it's definitely something I have got to continue to work hard on. [This] is arguably one of the toughest sports teams to get into as a fringe player at the moment," said Billings   "All I can do is take my opportunities when they arise. Building towards the subcontinent, whether that's the one-day formats or the longer format as well, I think it's somewhere I could potentially do well," he added.   The IPL 2020 is slated to start from September 19 in the UAE, while next year, the tournament is likely to be played in its normal window (March-May).   England are currently playing a three-match ODI series against Ireland. The Eoin Morgan led side won the first the game and will now lock horns with Ireland in the second ODI on Saturday. (ANI)

  History is taking a beating recently with the tearing down of statues and the defacing of monuments, and now one of Wellsville's most iconic buildings is going up for sale.


  At the last meeting of the village board of trustees they voted to move forward with the plan to put the former Municipal Building up for bid. They will have the bidding documents and requirement ready by the next board meeting. I don't know if they have put a value on the building. It might be easy to put a price on the building, if it were just a building, but it will be very difficult to put a price on the history of the building and the role it has played in the village's life.


  From its façade engraved with the names of iconic authors, to the clock in front with its stained glass scene of hot air balloons towering over a field of memorial blocks, engraved with the names of residents to the memorial bench, it will be hard to determine the value of the building to anyone, but someone from Wellsville.


  The mayor has said it is his hope that whoever gets the building will not greatly alter the interior. But what possible uses can facilitate the curving stairway down to the ground floor or leading up to the meeting room and offices?


  I can't imagine anything, but more offices. It would be difficult to turn it into a restaurant. It would take someone with more vision than I have to turn it into an eatery.


  It was built as a library. Since we have a pretty good one setting across the street from the former Municipal Building, I cannot see it being returned to its original purpose. Although it might be a fascinating place for a bookstore.


  As I said it will take a person with more imagination than I have to turn it into something else. The one thing I know for sure is that there has to be a plan for it. The board needs to guard against anyone making a bid, no matter how big and attractive, that is unrealistic. No one wants another historic building debacle like the depot. We don't want to watch another beautiful building fall into disrepair and become an eyesore, because of an irresponsible landowner who lives in a different town.


  I have mentioned it before, I think the building should be GIVEN to the Thelma Rogers Genealogical and Historical Society to be used as a museum for Wellsville. The current Dike Museum is too small to house and display all the memorabilia from the village's 167-year history.


  That building, with its rare hose drying tower, could then be used exclusively as a firemen's museum.


  Then Wellsville would have two museums to attract tourists.


  I hate to see the Municipal Building lose its place in history by becoming something less than historic.


  I feel much the same way about the statues and the memorials that are being defaced and torn done. What is next, the Statue of Liberty? How many Irish and Italian immigrants sailed past that monument on their way to years of indentured servitude instead of true freedom?


  In this new age we're running into where everyone is so sensitive about the nation's history, we need to rein in our emotion. Instead of tearing down statues and memorials use them as a teaching moment.


  They want to obliterate the facade on Stone Mountain, why not add to it with the story of Martin Luther King, Rosa Parks and Katherine Jackson. Broaden the meaning of the statues and memorials by recognizing the contributions of Black Americans. Do not cheapen American history. Accept it for what it was and do better. You know the saying, \"forget history and you are doomed to repeat it.\"


  As for the Municipal Building, like the other historical buildings on Main Street, its dignity needs to be preserved and what better way to preserve it than to give it to people who revere history.

  Cele has been on a mission to impress upon South Africans the need to control alcohol drinking habits, among others, to prevent the increase in crime.


  Over the 2019/2020 period, 94,273 cases of driving under the influence of alcohol and drugs were detected by the police.


  This has added onto the 759,904 cases of the same crimes recorded over the past 10 years.


  The data also points to crimes which took place at liquor outlets, including shebeens, taverns pubs and nightclubs among others.


  There were 1,430 murders attributed to alcohol-related crimes.

Speaking specifically to door rollers, Jim Johnson with Airlift Doors Inc. states that the best time to think about door maintenance is before “winter panic” begins. An overall upkeep list to maintain doors will include making sure weather stripping is in good condition, greasing the roller bearings, cycling the door and checking the operating system.

If you watch Netflix on Android, the company has recently confirmed that they are rolling out support for playback speed controls. This will let users speed up videos by 1.25x or 1.5x, or slow down videos by 0.5x or 0.75x. However, it seems that these settings will not be saved and users will need to manually speed up or slow down their videos with every video watched.


  Netflix actually started testing out this feature back in 2019 and despite it seeming like a somewhat banal feature to have, some creators have actually spoken up against it. For example actor Aaron Paul and director Braid Bird and Judd Apatow were some of those who were against it. According to Apatow's tweet, he felt that content distributors should not get the ability to change the way content is being presented.


  In a statement Netflix released to The Verge, a company spokesperson was quoted as saying, _" We've also been mindful of the concerns of some creators. It's why we have capped the range of playback speeds and require members to vary the speed each time they watch something new -- versus fixing their settings based on the last speed they used."_ For non-Android users, Netflix says they will start testing out the feature on its iOS app and also the web version, so expect support for those platforms later.

The actor thought his small gesture will help them take better care of their own health, while carrying out their duties."These bands will help policemen, once they wear it, by monitoring their body temperature, heart rate and blood pressure, and alerting them if they get fever. It also has an in-built pulse meter and oximeter, so, if at any point the police person is feeling unwell, it would notify. Then, without infecting others, he/she can be quarantined.Earlier in May this year, Kumar had gifted 1000 such wristbands to Mumbai Police and 500 to Nashik Police to track symptoms of the virus among front line workers who are above 45 years of age.Meanwhile, on the work front, the actor would soon start for his upcoming film, Bell Bottom, in UK along with actors Vaani Kapoor, Huma Qureshi and others.Follow @htshowbiz for more

Bloomberg) -- Gilead Sciences Inc. said Thursday it expects to make more than 2 million doses of Covid-19 treatment remdesivir by year-end.


  In May, the antiviral therapy received an emergency-use authorization to treat Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, after a major trial found it sped recovery by about four days in hospitalized patients. It is already being used in clinical practice.


  In its second-quarter earnings report, Gilead raised its outlook for the year, pointing in part to early success of remdesivir. It now expects earnings per share of $6.25 to $7.65, up from its earlier projections of $6.05 to $6.45 a share. It also expects increased revenue of $23 billion to $25 billion, compared with $21.8 billion to $22.2 billion.


  On a call with investors, Daniel O’Day, the company’s chief executive officer, said Gilead is working hard to further understand and expand remdesivir’s effectiveness in treating Covid-19. The company said it will study use of remdesivir earlier in Covid-19 in upcoming trials as well as in combination “with other therapies and in additional patient groups.”


  O’Day said Gilead wants to explore remdesivir it to treat coronavirus patients who haven’t been hospitalized yet.


  At the same time, the coronavirus pandemic has weakened demand for some of Foster City, California-based Gilead’s drugs, including some of its core hepatitis treatments. Shares declined 3% to $70.12 in late trading as the company reported earnings per share that missed even the lowest analyst estimate.


  There is also still the question of how profitable remdesivir will be, especially once a working vaccine is produced. It will go “hand in glove with vaccines,” O’Day said on the investor call.


  Gilead said in June it will charge U.S. hospitals about $3,120 for a course of remdesivir for most patients. The European Commission also signed a 63 million-euro ($74 million) contract with the company this week to supply the drug beginning next month.


  In its earnings report, Gilead said it has completed the donation of its existing stock of 1.5 million doses of the drug.


  In addition to having manufactured more than 2 million remdesivir treatment courses by the end of this year, Gilead said it expects to manufacture several million more courses in 2021.

A new survey of teachers, released just hours before Missouri reported the first day with more than 2,000 new COVID-19 cases, shows many are anxious about a return to in-class instruction.


   


  The Missouri National Education Association survey of more than 24,000 teachers showed that few think their districts can provide the protective gear they will need and an even smaller share think their districts have clear safety protocols and the space to implement them.


   


  "This survey finds that educators are experiencing high levels of stress and anxiety," says the report on the survey, released Thursday morning. "Educators worry about the health of students, coworkers, and their families. Educators believe safety should guide district decisions for returning to in-seat instruction."


   


  The 2,084 new coronavirus infections reported Thursday is the highest tally yet from the Department of Health and Senior Services and the third consecutive day of a new high. New highs have been set on seven of the past 10 days as the state has added 15,210 new cases, representing 31 percent of the 48,834 infections reported since early March.


   


  Of that total, 11,100 cases have been in people under 25 and that population represents a growing number of all cases. There were 501 new infections among people under 24 reported Thursday and in the past two weeks, that group's share of the total has grown from 19.7 percent to 22.8 percent.


   


  In Boone County, an even larger share of the case count is among younger people. The Columbia-Boone County Health Department reported 28 new infections on Thursday, bringing the total since mid-March to 1,142.


   


  Of the 342 new cases over the past two weeks, 142 have been among people under 25, who represent 41.5 percent of all cases reported in the county.


   


  Gov. Mike Parson, who has pushed for schools to reopen, on Wednesday backed Springfield Public Schools' plan to reopen schools with two days of in-person instruction per student.


   


  Parson met privately with local education leaders Wednesday.


   


  In a brief Q&A; with reporters, Parson acknowledged the frustration some residents have expressed with the policies, saying he knows many parents across the state want their kids back in the classroom full time.


   


  "But when you look at a Springfield school district," he said, "I would look at how big that is, and ask 'How do you do that?' and 'How do you do that safely?'"


   


  "I think at the end of the day, education is critical to our state," he continued. "But so is safety, and you're got to figure out how you can have the kids, the teachers, juniors, the administration, the cooks -- all of that comes together and you've got to decide how you deal with that."


   


  He allowed that many districts may need to make adjustments as they move forward, but expressed confidence they'll make the right call.


   


  "I'm confident in the administrators across this state, I'm confident in the school boards that are around here," he said. "They got elected to make decisions for their communities and they're going to know what best suits their communities."


   


  On Monday, the Boonville Board of Education approved a reopening plan for students and staff to return to classrooms Aug. 24.


   


  Reopening plans still could change between now and the first day of school though, Superintendent Sarah Marriott said. The plan right now is students and teachers will return to classrooms for the first time since March 17.


   


  Summer school just ended and Marriott is excited to for students to learn again, whether virtually or in-person.


   


  "We miss our students,"she said. "Learning is why we are in education. We feel that obviously it's extremely important."


   


  Parson's comments in Springfield came roughly a week after the district announced its final re-entry plan for the fall semester and gave parents two choices: Sign up for full-time virtual learning or the hybrid model with two days in the classroom and three days of virtual learning each week.


   


  Students with last names starting with A-K will go Mondays and Tuesdays, L-Z will go Thursdays and Fridays, and everyone will learn virtually Wednesday while schools are cleaned.


   


  Administrators framed the plan, which also requires everyone to wear masks, as a measured response to the ongoing pandemic and a troubling rise in cases through the region and the state.


   


  Some of those cases have hit within the district this summer, closing Rountree for a couple of weeks and halting in-person football conditioning at Glendale High School.


   


  But at least some parents have balked at the plan, including more than a dozen who gathered Monday at Park Central Square to demand full-time in-person learning.


   


  Some parents said they're worried their kids will fall behind online and others said they need their kids at school so they can go to work.


   


  Parson said he's also concerned about children from low-income families getting meals and seeing school nurses who may be their only health care provider.


   


  (Springfield schools plan to offer meal services five days per week regardless of whether students are learning at home or at school.)


   


  But Parson also said he trusts local leaders to make the right calls and make adjustments as they're necessary.


   


  "I think the Springfield school district, (Superintendent) John (Jungmann) does a good job down here," Parson said. "And if he needs to make adjustments, he'll make adjustments, because I think all school districts will as we move forward."


   


  Jungmann, for his part, also addressed criticism Wednesday, saying he and every school administrator in the state want to return to normal as soon as possible.


   


  "We just don't believe that we can effectively start that way," he said.


   


  He added that administrators think the district can get back to five-days-a- week in-person at the end of the first quarter of the school year, but cautioned that the trajectory of the virus would "push our decision making when it comes to next steps."


   


  The Missouri National Education Association survey shows teachers are wary of returning.


   


  In a report dated Sunday, the White House's coronavirus task force designated Missouri as one of around 20 states with "red zone" status after it recorded more than 100 new cases per 100,000 people last week.


   


  "No one wants our students back in schools more than educators, but we must prioritize student and educator safety," Phil Murray, a Poplar Bluff teacher and president of the union, said in a news release.


   


  Parson, a Republican, also spoke Wednesday for the Springfield Area Chamber of Commerce's version of the "State of the State."


   


  Parson spent part of the speech touting progress combating the pandemic, noting hospitals have yet to be overwhelmed and pointing out testing and personal protective equipment have gotten far more accessible.


   


  "I'm so proud of our citizens, Missouri companies, chambers and communities across the state for doing their part," he said. "Thanks to all of you, we have overcome all of these obstacles."


   


  Despite that success, the state has continued to report record one-day increases in COVID-19 cases over and over in recent weeks. State data also show the percentage of tests coming back positive is increasing, indicating current containment efforts are not enough to slow the spread.


   


  Despite the rising numbers, Missouri "is in a different place" than it was early in the pandemic thanks to better testing and a better understanding of the illness, a spokeswoman for the state health department said.


   


  Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services spokeswoman Lisa Cox said in an email that health officials now know more about how the virus behaves and are better prepared to deal with it.


   


  Testing has also improved greatly, Cox said. Whereas only a few thousand Missourians were tested each week early in the pandemic, more than 90,000 people are now being tested weekly, she said.


   


  Cox cited a big increase in the number of younger people coming down with the virus, raising concern that many have "let their guard down on using preventive measures such as social distancing, wearing face masks and using good hand-washing," Cox said.

With many school plans for the fall still in flux, Andres’ World Central Kitchen and the American Federation of Teachers announced a coalition Thursday of 35 organizations ranging from the NAACP to the Hispanic Federation, to urge Congress to expand and extend the school meal program in light of the worsening hunger crisis brought on by the pandemic.


  “This is a new initiative, obviously, but it’s old,” said Andres. “Let me take you back to 1946 when the school lunch program started. The military advocated for it, because they were getting young men from rural communities who were highly underfed and unhealthy. We should never be seeing children in the Bronx during the pandemic waiting on line for food for six hours in the richest nation on the planet.”


  House Education and Labor Committee Chairman Robert C. “Bobby” Scott on Thursday introduced the Pandemic Child Hunger Prevention Act to provide universal breakfast and lunch this school year for all schoolchildren. If enacted, this bill would provide free meals to students regardless of their family’s income. The bill lets schools operating summer feeding and after- school programs to serve all children without having to certify the eligibility of each individual child.


  Thirty-six senators expressed support for the extension of pandemic school feeding waivers in a letter, spearheaded by Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., sent Wednesday to Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue.


  Not all anti-hunger advocates are in favor of the bill. Share Our Strength Senior Vice President Lisa Davis said her organization is not endorsing the bill. She said she is optimistic that SNAP will be expanded and Pandemic EBT extended.


  “There’s a new study every week showing a dramatic increase in need due to the pandemic,” Davis said. “When the dollars on the table are limited, this could work against that.”


  The Center for Science in the Public Interest and the American Heart Association endorsed the bill.


  “We do know that pre-pandemic, food-insecure children had more negative health outcomes,” said Mark Schoeberl, executive vice president of advocacy for the American Heart Association. “And that food-insecure children were more likely to eat and receive more of their nutrient intake from school meals, making it even more critical that we use all tools at our disposal to provide children with healthy school meals during this time of uncertainty.”


  The School Nutrition Association, the trade group for school food-service manufacturers and school food professionals, is strongly endorsing this bill.


  “With so many families struggling to put food on the table during the pandemic, millions more students will depend on consistent, daily access to school meals this fall,” said SNA President Reggie Ross in a statement. He said the bill spares overburdened schools, many considering vastly different learning models during the pandemic, the massive task of distributing and processing meal applications and reduces the stigma for children who depend on free meals. SNA has also urged Congress to provide emergency financial relief to school meal programs to cover costs associated with coronavirus closures.

With China throwing its weight around in the South China Sea, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo rightly declared this month that the country's aggressive claims to offshore resources in the area were ''completely unlawful.''


   


  The strategic importance of the South China Sea cannot be overstated. A third of the world's shipping passes through it, its fisheries are critical sources of food for millions of people in Southeast Asia and its seabed covers vast reserves of oil and gas. China's exorbitant claims and might-makes-right behavior are self-evidently destabilizing to the international rule of law.


   


  The problem is that Pompeo's statement is meaningful only if it is accompanied by a firm commitment by the Trump administration to a robust and coordinated policy.


   


  Trump has vacillated between waging a tariff war against China's ''predatory practices'' in trade, singing paeans to President Xi Jinping and, according to John Bolton's account of his time as Trump's national security adviser, seeking favors from Xi to help his reelection.


   


  In the absence of any coherent China policy, the administration's proclivity for tearing up treaties and its disdain for alliances, Pompeo's belated declaration that China is violating international law sounds a bit hollow.


   


  It is, nonetheless, a message that is valid and long overdue. In the past decade, China has steadily hardened its claims to most of the South China Sea, a zone circumscribed by a vague ''nine-dash line'' that one U.S. naval commander called the ''Great Wall of Sand.''


   


  In recent months, with much of the world preoccupied with the COVID-19 pandemic, China has sharply escalated its coercive activities. In early April, a Chinese coast guard vessel sank a Vietnamese fishing boat close to islands claimed by both China and Vietnam. The Chinese navy has sealed off an area around the Paracel Islands to conduct naval exercises; in response, the United States increased its own naval activities, including joint exercises by two aircraft carrier groups.


   


  These confrontations have contributed to a sharp deterioration in U.S.-China relations on other fronts.


   


  Dealing with the new China will require a balance of diplomacy, firmness, credible deterrents and a code of conduct, especially in the South China Sea. It will require a broad consensus among China's Southeast Asian neighbors and America's allies.


   


  In fact, Pompeo's statement did not break new ground, since the United States already effectively recognized the 2016 decision of an international arbitration court that rebuffed China's ''nine-dash line'' claims. What Pompeo did was to overtly declare the validity of the decision.


   


  Though not necessarily a change of policy, the statement would give greater authority to any U.S.-led punitive actions, whether through sanctions, United Nations resolutions or joint action.


   


  Yet the administration has largely spurned international organizations, and its approach to China has vacillated widely and unpredictably. Trump tore up the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement with 11 other countries and launched a tariff war against China while at the same time heaping praise on Xi, avoiding criticism of China's human-rights violations and claiming that ''our relationship with China has now probably never, ever been better.''


   


  Pompeo has said the right things about China's unlawful behavior. But unless words are accompanied by a credible U.S. reengagement in the region, including a clear commitment to diplomacy, investment and security, the words are just more election-year bluster.

The oil-rich United Arab Emirates on Saturday announced the startup of its Barakah nuclear power plant, a first for the Arab world.


  "UAE first nuclear reactor at the Barakah Nuclear Energy Plant has achieved first criticality and successfully started up," tweeted Hamad Alkaabi, the country's representative to the International Atomic Energy Agency.


  "This is a historic milestone for the nation with a vision set to deliver a new form of clean energy for the nation," he tweeted in English, along with a photograph of technicians raising their arms in celebration.


  The UAE premier and ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al-Maktoum, tweeted that work at Barakah had "succeeded in loading nuclear fuel packages, carrying out comprehensive tests and successfully completing the operation".


  "Congratulations on realising this historic achievement in the energy sector & marking this milestone in the roadmap for sustainable development," Sheikh Mohammed said.


  The UAE started loading fuel rods into the reactor at Barakah in February, after regulators gave the green light for the first of the plant's four reactors, opening the way for commercial operations.


  The plant on the Gulf coast west of Abu Dhabi had been due to go online in late 2017 but faced a number of delays that officials attributed to safety and regulatory requirements.


  The Nawah Energy Company said at the time that Unit 1 will begin commercial operations after a "series of tests" leading to the start-up process.


  During the process, the unit will be synchronised with the power grid and the first electricity produced.


  The UAE has substantial oil and gas reserves, but with a power-hungry population of 10 million it has made huge investments in developing clean alternatives, including solar energy.


  The plant is a regional first -- Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil exporter, has said it plans to build up to 16 nuclear reactors, but the project has yet to materialise.

David Hunter, the chief macro strategist at Contrarian Macro Advisors, isn't coy in his assessment of the prevailing economic environment.


  "I think we're in the bust now," he said in a recent O&M Partners interview. "So, I use the term 'bust' to describe something that's bigger than a recession, steeper and worse than a recession, but not as elongated as a depression."


  The way Hunter sees it, the bust will take place in two parts: (1) The initial shock and short-lived recovery (2) The "steeper and deeper" drawdown.


  Right now, we're in phase 1. After initial annihilation due to the COVID-19 pandemic, economic data -- although still weak -- is starting to recover from its nadir.


  But according to Hunter, phase two isn't far off. We're not out of the woods yet.


  To him, it's only a matter of time until these measures turn south again. In his mind, the stimulus that central banks and governments are bestowing upon the economy are perpetuating an uneven recovery -- one that's not supportive of many sectors and facets of the economy that need help.


  "Probably late this year, or early next, we'll end this bounce and start heading the other way again," he said. "I think the second phase, you have much more insolvency issues."


  Hunter's insolvency forecast echos that of John Hussman -- the outspoken investor and former professor who's long predicted a market collapse. In a recent note, Hussman provided the following chart from Bloomberg portraying a voracious uptick in bankruptcies.

  Swansea and Sheffield Wednesday fans may be surprised to see their former manager on this list, but the job Carvalhal has done with Portuguese side Rio Ave should not be understated.


  A club with an average home attendance of 2,722 are not expected to mix it with the elite. But Carvalhal impressively guided his side to a fifth-placed finish in the Primeira Liga this season, securing a place in the Europa League.


  Rio Ave were, in fact, only five points behind third-placed Braga in the final standings, and Carvalhal deserves plenty of plaudits for his achievements over the past year.

Leeds [UK], Aug 1 (ANI): Arsenal's forward Alexandre Lacazette believes that the FA Cup win will be able to salvage the 2019-20 season for his side.   His remark comes as Arsenal gets ready to lock horns with Chelsea in the FA Cup finals at the Wembley Stadium later today.   "We are excited because we know we can save our season with a trophy, which would mean a lot for us and the fans," Goal.com quoted Lacazette as saying.   "In the league, we finished in a bad position, we lost against Olympiacos early in the Europa League, so we missed a few of our targets. That's why I say it would save our season," he added.   Arsenal had finished the 2019-20 Premier League season at the eighth position and this resulted in the club's worst top-flight showing in 25 years.   Unai Emery was sacked as the manager in November and the Gunners then appointed Mikel Arteta as the coach of the side.   Off late, Arsenal has enjoyed some success as the side defeated Manchester City in the semi-finals of the FA Cup.   Arsenal also managed to defeat Liverpool in the Premier League as well.   The Gunners can still qualify for the Europa League if they win the FA Cup for a record-extending 14th time.   "I came to Arsenal to win trophies. Yes, it's been really frustrating, but this is part of football. Nothing is ever easy and this is why I love this sport because you can learn from this and become a great man with these kinds of experiences," Lacazette said.   "But obviously at the end, you are a bit disappointed. So you just go forward to the next season to change this and to reach your targets. So obviously this time it's a really big game for me and for Arsenal," he added. (ANI)

A man has been charged with four counts of manslaughter over the Melbourne freeway crash that killed four Victorian police officers.


  The 49-year-old from Frankston was arrested in Lyndhurst in Melbourne's southeast on Saturday morning and later charged, Victoria Police say.


  The man is expected to appear before an out of sessions hearing in Melbourne tonight, police said, and the charges follow a three-month investigation.


  The man is understood to be an employee of the trucking company involved in the fatal accident, that has been penalised for safety breaches including truck defects and using fatigued drivers.


  The four officers - Lynette Taylor, Kevin King, Glen Humphris and Joshua Prestney - were killed on duty while impounding a Porsche on the Eastern Freeway at Kew on April 22.


  Police allege Porsche driver Richard Pusey, 41, was clocked doing 149km/h while under the influence of methamphetamine and cannabis, prompting police to impound his car.


  The officers were hit while they were dealing with Pusey, who then allegedly filmed the crash site and verbally abused Senior Constable Taylor before running away.


  Pusey, of Fitzroy, was charged with nine offences including driving at a dangerous speed, reckless conduct endangering life, failing to render assistance and drug possession.


  The four constables were farewelled at private funerals and tributes flowed for them across the state.

History is taking a beating recently with the tearing down of statues and the defacing of monuments, and now one of Wellsville's most iconic buildings is going up for sale.


   


  At the last meeting of the village board of trustees they voted to move forward with the plan to put the former Municipal Building up for bid. They will have the bidding documents and requirement ready by the next board meeting. I don't know if they have put a value on the building. It might be easy to put a price on the building, if it were just a building, but it will be very difficult to put a price on the history of the building and the role it has played in the village's life.


   


  From its façade engraved with the names of iconic authors, to the clock in front with its stained glass scene of hot air balloons towering over a field of memorial blocks, engraved with the names of residents to the memorial bench, it will be hard to determine the value of the building to anyone, but someone from Wellsville.


   


  The mayor has said it is his hope that whoever gets the building will not greatly alter the interior. But what possible uses can facilitate the curving stairway down to the ground floor or leading up to the meeting room and offices?


   


  I can't imagine anything, but more offices. It would be difficult to turn it into a restaurant. It would take someone with more vision than I have to turn it into an eatery.


   


  It was built as a library. Since we have a pretty good one setting across the street from the former Municipal Building, I cannot see it being returned to its original purpose. Although it might be a fascinating place for a bookstore.


   


  As I said it will take a person with more imagination than I have to turn it into something else. The one thing I know for sure is that there has to be a plan for it. The board needs to guard against anyone making a bid, no matter how big and attractive, that is unrealistic. No one wants another historic building debacle like the depot. We don't want to watch another beautiful building fall into disrepair and become an eyesore, because of an irresponsible landowner who lives in a different town.


   


  I have mentioned it before, I think the building should be GIVEN to the Thelma Rogers Genealogical and Historical Society to be used as a museum for Wellsville. The current Dike Museum is too small to house and display all the memorabilia from the village's 167-year history.


   


  That building, with its rare hose drying tower, could then be used exclusively as a firemen's museum.


   


  Then Wellsville would have two museums to attract tourists.


   


  I hate to see the Municipal Building lose its place in history by becoming something less than historic.


   


  I feel much the same way about the statues and the memorials that are being defaced and torn done. What is next, the Statue of Liberty? How many Irish and Italian immigrants sailed past that monument on their way to years of indentured servitude instead of true freedom?


   


  In this new age we're running into where everyone is so sensitive about the nation's history, we need to rein in our emotion. Instead of tearing down statues and memorials use them as a teaching moment.


   


  They want to obliterate the facade on Stone Mountain, why not add to it with the story of Martin Luther King, Rosa Parks and Katherine Jackson. Broaden the meaning of the statues and memorials by recognizing the contributions of Black Americans. Do not cheapen American history. Accept it for what it was and do better. You know the saying, "forget history and you are doomed to repeat it."


   


  As for the Municipal Building, like the other historical buildings on Main Street, its dignity needs to be preserved and what better way to preserve it than to give it to people who revere history.

  With China throwing its weight around in the South China Sea, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo rightly declared this month that the country's aggressive claims to offshore resources in the area were ''completely unlawful.''


  The strategic importance of the South China Sea cannot be overstated. A third of the world's shipping passes through it, its fisheries are critical sources of food for millions of people in Southeast Asia and its seabed covers vast reserves of oil and gas. China's exorbitant claims and might-makes-right behavior are self-evidently destabilizing to the international rule of law.


  The problem is that Pompeo's statement is meaningful only if it is accompanied by a firm commitment by the Trump administration to a robust and coordinated policy.


  Trump has vacillated between waging a tariff war against China's ''predatory practices'' in trade, singing paeans to President Xi Jinping and, according to John Bolton's account of his time as Trump's national security adviser, seeking favors from Xi to help his reelection.


  In the absence of any coherent China policy, the administration's proclivity for tearing up treaties and its disdain for alliances, Pompeo's belated declaration that China is violating international law sounds a bit hollow.


  It is, nonetheless, a message that is valid and long overdue. In the past decade, China has steadily hardened its claims to most of the South China Sea, a zone circumscribed by a vague ''nine-dash line'' that one U.S. naval commander called the ''Great Wall of Sand.''


  In recent months, with much of the world preoccupied with the COVID-19 pandemic, China has sharply escalated its coercive activities. In early April, a Chinese coast guard vessel sank a Vietnamese fishing boat close to islands claimed by both China and Vietnam. The Chinese navy has sealed off an area around the Paracel Islands to conduct naval exercises; in response, the United States increased its own naval activities, including joint exercises by two aircraft carrier groups.


  These confrontations have contributed to a sharp deterioration in U.S.-China relations on other fronts.


  Dealing with the new China will require a balance of diplomacy, firmness, credible deterrents and a code of conduct, especially in the South China Sea. It will require a broad consensus among China's Southeast Asian neighbors and America's allies.


  In fact, Pompeo's statement did not break new ground, since the United States already effectively recognized the 2016 decision of an international arbitration court that rebuffed China's ''nine-dash line'' claims. What Pompeo did was to overtly declare the validity of the decision.


  Though not necessarily a change of policy, the statement would give greater authority to any U.S.-led punitive actions, whether through sanctions, United Nations resolutions or joint action.


  Yet the administration has largely spurned international organizations, and its approach to China has vacillated widely and unpredictably. Trump tore up the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement with 11 other countries and launched a tariff war against China while at the same time heaping praise on Xi, avoiding criticism of China's human-rights violations and claiming that ''our relationship with China has now probably never, ever been better.''


  Pompeo has said the right things about China's unlawful behavior. But unless words are accompanied by a credible U.S. reengagement in the region, including a clear commitment to diplomacy, investment and security, the words are just more election-year bluster.

  “If such action is committed by a guest at the club they will be banned from returning.

In this time of destabilization of the United States of America, I was privy to read the letter from Black dental students to the dean of the Ohio State University College of Dentistry.


   


  The letter very eloquently addressed the lack of African Americans and other minorities in the College of Dentistry in the faculty, student body, graduate programs and coursework.


   


  Black people make up approximately 13% of the general population in the state of Ohio and approximately 28.5% in the city of Columbus. But according to the College of Dentistry, we are lumped into the "underrepresented minority" of 6.6% to overlook the lack of African Americans/Blacks.


   


  I feel this is the time to work together to address the lack of health care in the Black community. For too long the number of Black dentists has been approximately 3.8% of the dentists in the USA and approximately 13% of the USA population.


   


  I would like to thank those students for giving me back my hope.

But there’s one other area where EVs can not only be charged in a way that fits into low-demand slots in the national energy usage cycle, but even provide assistance to smooth out supply at peak times. This is a technology called vehicle-to-grid (V2G). The idea is that you leave your EV plugged into the electricity when not in use, and it can supply energy as well take it. It will basically act like a mobile Tesla Powerwall, a domestic battery that can absorb energy at times of overproduction, and then put it back into the grid during peak demand. This will be increasingly important as a larger percentage of supply is taken up by renewable sources, which tend to be less predictable in when they deliver capacity than fossil fuel or nuclear power plants, which can be more easily turned off and on when required. It’s even more useful if your home has its own renewable energy production.

I believe the day will come when the major fact (behind today’s events) is revealed, because what happened today was very strange. It wasn’t merely a confused Israeli soldier who was firing a M16 or PKM, or even a single tank firing at an invisible target. Rather, it consisted of extremely heavy shelling from several (Israeli) sources of fire, all of which were targeting an (Israeli) military base, and this lasted for several minutes. The information was delivered to the (Israeli) prime minister and he (immediately) issued threats and assessed the (magnitude of the) situation. Something major occurred at this (military) site. I think that the enemy today is extremely confused to the maximum level possible. What happened to its forces? Who gave the order to open fire? What (is the nature of the) penetration that took place? What camouflage (tactics) were used?

The Ohio Department of Health, Franklin County Public Health and Columbus Public Health are all working around the clock on COVID-19.


   


  But public health departments do a lot more than respond to a global pandemic. They offer a variety of services to the community, involving such things as vaccines, food safety, body-art licensing, water protection and infant safety.


   


  And unlike the private health care system that may seem geared toward individuals, public health focuses on keeping all citizens healthy.


   


  "It's really about the science of creating healthy communities," said Theresa Seagraves, assistant health commissioner for Franklin County.


   


  The Ohio Department of Health, for example, works with local health departments to promote healthy lifestyles and puts out guidance and procedures on public health concerns such as the novel coronavirus and vaping. It's up to local health departments to implement those practices at a local level.


   


  "The agency's role is to advance the health and well-being of Ohioans," department spokeswoman Melanie Amato said in an email. "ODH works in collaboration with local health departments across the state to prevent disease, promote good health, and assure access to quality care through a variety of programs."


   


  Overall, the state Health Department is involved in more than 160 programs involving such topics as asthma, tobacco-use prevention and cessation, lead poisoning, pregnancy risk-assessment monitoring and HIV prevention.


   


  The Buckeye State, home to nearly 11.7 million people, spent about $13 per person on public health in 2018, according to an analysis from the State Health Access Data Assistance Center at the University of Minnesota. Only Arizona, Nevada and Missouri spent less on public health per capita in 2018, the analysis found.


   


  "Not just in Ohio, but we've historically in this country underfunded public health," Gov. Mike DeWine said during a coronavirus briefing at the end of March. "One of the lessons from this pandemic ... there's going to be a consensus. We've got to fund consistently year after year public health and do a much better job."


   


  Columbus Public Health serves the cities of Columbus and Worthington, while Franklin County Public Health serves the other cities, townships and villages in the county.


   


  About 75% of the Columbus health department's $35.8 million budget is provided by the city, which increased the amount it provides to the department by more than $1.7 million this year, according to the city's annual budget.


   


  Columbus Public Health has more than 40 different programs and various clinics offering immunizations, dental care, alcohol and drug treatment, sexual health guidance and information on the health of women, infants and children. Its programs include such matters as child injury prevention, minority health, body-art licensing and the issuance of birth and death certificates.


   


  Franklin County Public Health analyzes health data and allows the data to drive its policy decisions, Seagraves said. That data has led the agency to prioritize the tackling of such "pressing issues" as the opioid crisis, infant mortality, vaping, heart disease, diabetes and tobacco use, she said.


   


  Of course, these days, COVID-19 has greatly impacted the day-to-day activities of health departments in central Ohio and across the country.


   


  "Local public health departments are the front line for COVID-19," Amato said in an email. "ODH often provides funding, technical support, program design, and data collection and analysis to support local work."


   


  Employees at Columbus Public Health has been working nearly 12 hours a day seven days a week since the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic in mid-March. Before, the agency primarily operated regular business hours Monday through Friday, with the occasional Saturday clinic.


   


  Columbus Public Health has hired 46 additional staff to work as contract tracers. Overall, the health department has more than 180 contact tracers. While the department's general budget hasn't grown, it has received CARES money to help fund COVID-19 testing and contact tracing.


   


  "It has definitely altered the way we operate here," Dr. Mysheika W. Roberts, Columbus Public Health commissioner, said of COVID-19.


   


  Columbus Public Health employees interview every person determined to have coronavirus who lives in Columbus and Worthington. These cases are reported to them by the Ohio Disease Reporting System, which provides real-time secured access for state and local public health practitioners to report infectious diseases. Columbus Public Health asks those infected about their symptoms and their contact with other people. More than 180 staff members are tasked with contacting and interviewing people with coronavirus and those who have possibly been exposed.


   


  A questionnaire with more than 60 questions aids in the process.


   


  "It's a lot of work; it's very time intensive," Roberts said.


   


  Columbus Public Health offers COVID-19 testing and also responds to complaints that the agency receives about people not following state health orders.


   


  "The goal is to provide education and do everything we can to control the spread of the virus in our community," Roberts said.


   


  Franklin County Public Health has hired about 25 additional staff members to perform contact tracing, she said.


   


  "COVID has become literally almost like a second job, so they're doing COVID during the day, evenings and weekends sometimes," said Seagraves, resulting in "a lot of overtime."

1946 — 2020


  Stephen Ernest Martin departed at the young age of 73. He fought a fierce battle with Lewy Body Dementia and lost the fight on June 24th, 2020. He was born in Provo, Utah, on August 7th,1946, to Grace and Kenneth Martin. Steve married his high school sweetheart, Dena Kardaras Martin, in 1967, and they have lived an incredible 53 years together. Stephen and Dena traveled the world as Steve climbed the ranks in the Navy. He was a Naval navigator, flying the P3 Orion. Flying was his passion, and he always said, “I loved chasing submarines.” He was released from active duty as a Commander in 1973 and continued reserve status until he retired in 1995.


  Steve was very accomplished throughout his lifetime. He received his undergrad from BYU and graduated from University of Utah with an MBA in Business, he earned his real estate license and was an accomplished CPA. Steve was an entrepreneur and worked hard, building his successful businesses. Not only was he a successful businessman, but he was also an incredible husband, dad, Papa, son, brother, and friend. He would give the shirt off his back for anyone who was in need. He put everybody first before he would even think about himself. He was kind, funny, with a dry sense of humor and always was one to give you a good laugh.

  “There are some environments, some venues, that are so conducive to the spread of the coronavirus that they really cannot be run safely, and barrooms are one of those,” Edwards said Thursday. “We’ve seen this from data from all over the world.”

Dr. Deborah Birx with the White House coronavirus task force says closing bars is a best practice to control the spread in states with a high incidence of COVID cases, Edwards noted. Louisiana has more confirmed cases per capita than any other state.


  He acknowledged the economic harm caused by closing businesses and stressed that it was not an easy decision, but said closing bars along with other mitigation methods will help the state avoid moving backwards toward stricter restrictions or a “stay-at-home” order.


  “We have a public health emergency,” Edwards said. “I believe at the end of the day, the court will fully understand that not only do I have the authority under the constitution and the laws of the United States to do what I’ve done, but what I’ve done is absolutely essential.”


  State officials mostly have been lenient in their enforcement of the governor’s executive orders, giving business owners multiple chances to get into compliance. The state Office of Alcohol and Tobacco Control this week announced 30-day suspensions of bar licenses pending hearings for four businesses for “excessive and/or repeated non-compliance with Gov. John Bel Edwards’ emergency order aimed at mitigating the spread of COVID-19.”
