When U.S. Rep. Roger Marshall -- a Kansas native, practicing physician in Great Bend for 25 years and Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate in the upcoming Tuesday, Aug. 4, primary -- talks about a phone call he received from a Dodge City doctor a few months ago, he takes on a solemn tone.
   
 The seriousness of the situation is certainly not lost on him.
   
 "It was a Wednesday afternoon," Marshall said in a phone interview Wednesday, July 29. "He said, 'Roger, we've got 10 or 15 patients out here in the parking lot that are going to test positive for COVID. They work at the packing plant. It's going to take a week to get the results back. I need your help."
   
 The 59-year-old "Big First" District congressman said he immediately picked up the phone and called the White House Coronavirus Task Force in Washington, D.C.
   
 "I told them the situation," he said. "It's going to explode."
   
 Marshall said he saw COVID-19 completely shut down packing plants in other states, adding the virus thrives in cold, humid environments.
   
 "I said, '25 percent of America's beef is processed right here in southwest Kansas,' " Marshall said. " 'We cannot let these shut down.' "
   
 Overnight, Marshall said, the task force started shipping testing supplies and personal protective equipment to Dodge City.
   
 He then reached out to a friend, who he called a "logistics champion," with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Within days, that friend, who also sets up health care units at the Mexico and U.S. border, was organizing Dodge City's efforts, he said.
   
 "I called a private company and said, 'I need 6,000 test kits tomorrow,' " Marshall said. "And they said, 'We'll have them overnighted right away.' "
   
 He said care teams had enough 15-minute point of care test kits for every employee at the packing plant, enabling the National Guard to start contact tracing for those sick.
   
 As the virus continued to spread, Marshall said he also helped with efforts in both Garden City and Liberal.
   
 It was in Liberal that Marshall said he again called on the federal government for help.
   
 "For whatever reason, Liberal was the one that more patients were showing up in the ER," he said. "So I stayed there on a Friday night. We had one ventilator left."
   
 Marshall said he again called Washington, D.C.
   
 "Sunday afternoon, two Blackhawk helicopters with four ventilators showed up," he said.
   
 He said Southwest Medical Center in Liberal also received much-needed PPE in the same way.
   
 More than anything, Marshall said, he is "so proud" of how local health departments, health care providers and volunteers in Ford, Finney and Seward counties came together and worked with the federal government when COVID-19 came knocking on their doors.
   
 And, he said, Washington, D.C., gave those front line workers "everything they needed to be successful."
   
 "The community solved the problem," Marshall said. "We didn't just flatten the curve. We took the top off the mountain. And, we kept the packing plants open."
   
 Even months later, the pandemic remains "front and center" in the challenges facing the state, he said.
   
 "It seems like every conversation starts and ends with COVID," he said. "How do we safely and responsibly get our kids back to school? How do we safely and responsibly continue to open up the Kansas businesses?"
   
 Marshall said the COVID-19 crisis is complex, reminiscent of his time caring for patients in Great Bend.
   
 "You can never treat just one part of a patient," Marshall said. "You know you can't take care of their heart and ignore their liver, and you can't ignore their brain. It's all related."
   
 He said God has given him "the ability to take all these pieces of the puzzle and see them as one challenge, one opportunity, and knowing how all those pieces are going to interact with each other."
   
 Marshall said the U.S. and Kansas have made gains in one piece of the COVID-19 puzzle -- treatment of patients -- thanks to developments in antiviral drugs and physicians' use of steroids and blood thinners.
   
 "We've really cut the morbidity and mortality down," he said.
   
 The government is also working to reach people most vulnerable to the virus, those 70 and older living in nursing homes, through point of care testing at every nursing home across the nation, Marshall said.
   
 "Over the next two weeks, they'll have that 15-minute test available, so they can catch the first person in the nursing home with the virus before it spreads to 20 other people," he said. "So, we're trying to take care of the most vulnerable."
   
 He said, however, the most pressing issue for Kansans now is how to safely get kids back in school.
   
 "I think there's a safe and responsible way to do it," Marshall said.
   
 He said for children and young adults under the age of 25, the chances of dying from COVID-19 are "probably less than one in 1,000."
   
 In turn, he said, the benefits of kids returning to schools, like providing quality education, improving mental and social development, reducing child abuse and distributing healthy meals, far outweigh the risks.
   
 With children back in schools, parents can also return to work, Marshall said.
   
 "The good news is that the unemployment rate in Kansas has dropped to 7 percent," he said. "We're starting to catch a little wind."
   
 Marshall said it's important to "respect the virus," but not let it "control and manage our lives."
   
 "I'm absolutely convinced, as a doctor, that the unintended consequences of the virus will kill more people than the virus," he said, bringing up suicides, poverty-related illness and untreated sickness.
   
 Marshall, however, said he sees hope on the horizon.
   
 He said there are "vaccines on the way."
   
 In fact, he said two vaccines are nearing the manufacturing phase and over a hundred vaccines are in other phases of testing.
   
 "We're very hopeful we'll have a vaccine for the most vulnerable come this Thanksgiving time, and then vaccines for everybody, for the entire country, by the New Year," Marshall said.
   
 Campaigning during the COVID-19 crisis has been tough, Marshall said.
   
 "You go to rural America, and if you don't shake a person's hand and look them in the eye, they look at you like, 'What's wrong with you?' " he said.
   
 In turn, Marshall said, he's taken steps to ensure he can safely meet with his constituents face to face.
   
 He's hosting outdoor events throughout the state, which allows for social distancing. His team is also relying on videos, online meetings and phone calls to reach out to people.
   
 Marshall said while he hasn't experienced COVID-19 symptoms, he's been tested for the virus three times during his campaign as a precaution.
   
 "It's been a huge challenge, no doubt," he said.
   
 Despite the struggles he has faced on the campaign trail, Marshall said he knows he's not alone.
   
 "This virus has impacted everybody, whether you're a doctor or a hospital," he said. "Whether you're a restaurant or a bar, a farmer, a cattle rancher. This virus has impacted everybody. There's very, very few industries that have not been impacted by it."

JOSH HARTNETT: The structure of the story is something that (writer/director) Daniel [Roby] found in the script, but it wasn’t quite as tight as it is now, in the edit. To me, it seemed like an obvious solution to ending up with a character that you know more than, which would, more or less, stop the film in its tracks. So, I think he did a really good job of weaving these three stories together, in a way that felt like you were current with the characters. That’s a great element of the film and a great element to the filmmaking. But the thing that got me was that I felt, initially, that the story was great and I understood where this journalist was coming from. I wanted to see him succeed, wanted to believe in him, and thought of him as heroic and larger than life, but I also liked the conflict that he was having and I wanted to know more about that. Honestly, I had just found out that I was gonna have my first child and was wondering how that was gonna affect me, as a dad, as an actor and just in my life, so I felt his dilemma, on a personal level. And then, I met and spoke to Daniel, who directed it, and his passion for the film was overt and palpable, and I always wanna work with directors who are passionate and want to be as involved with as many projects as I can be, that are the director’s passion project. He’d been working on this for eight years, before we even met, so I knew that he needed to tell the story. And then, he invited me up to Toronto to meet Victor, and Daniel, Victor and I spent the day together. I was compelled by Victor as a person, as well. There was a lot going for it. I just believed that Daniel would be able to make something spectacular. Even though he didn’t have the budget that he would have liked to have had, he has a lot of ingenuity and he’s a smart guy, and he really understands filmmaking. I just knew he was gonna be able to pull this off.

Elaborating on the Government measures for implementing factors of production reforms, Mr. Goyal remarked that Government will be soon doing a soft launch of Land Bank Portal, with six states on board, for which 5 lakh hectares of land has already been identified.

Government is also looking for onboarding more states for helping them ease their labour laws and compliances, on the lines of what has been done in Uttar Pradesh, where industry has been exempt from select labour laws for 3 years, he further added.

HARTNETT: We’re starting back up on the production that we had shut down, at the beginning of the lockdown. Everything’s changed, but it’s still the same people. I got here yesterday (July 14th), to Paris, and we’re just getting started up on it again. It’s a very new world, making films now. The different departments are isolated in their own little groups, everyone’s wearing masks, everybody’s been tested for COVID, and everyone is supposed to be self- isolating while we’re making this. It’s an experiment. I think we’re the first production that’s up and running in France right now. We’ll see if it works, without people getting sick.

On July 17, the nation said goodbye to C.T. Vivian and John Lewis, giants of our time. Both men were born when opportunities for African-Americans were restricted by law. In the face of Black Codes, Jim Crow laws and indiscriminate lynching that kept racial segregation firmly in place, these men refused to be denied the promises articulated in the founding documents of this nation.
   
 At a young age they were on the frontlines of the modern Civil Rights Movement and sacrificed all to join history making battles for the constitutional right to vote for African-Americans.
   
 The Brown Foundation was honored to share the company of these two men. We hosted Congressman Lewis in Topeka on three occasions. I first met him in 1992 when I was working on the bill to establish Brown v. Board National Historic Site. He joined me in testifying before a Congressional Committee that oversees National Parks.
   
 Their passing calls on us to compare the pervasive indifference of the current administration with activism of past decades that demanded accountability of government leaders. Activism that swayed public opinion and positively influenced federal legislation. To honor the memory of C.T. Vivian and John Lewis we must vote Nov. 3. Voter suppression is about fear. Fear of the majority losing power. Fear of people of color freely voting for what is in our best interest.
   
 As we traverse the months leading to election day. The courage of C.T. Vivian and John Lewis must be our North Star.

HARTNETT: Yes, there was one thing, actually, that really helped me, in getting into the character, which was that Victor comes across, in his filmed interviews and in his books, as someone who will stop at nothing to uncover the truth. It’s a very grandstandy, larger than life character, and what I really learned from meeting him was that, behind all of that, he’s a very soft character with a soft touch. He’s dedicated to his family and there’s a central humanity to him that drives that larger than life aspect of his character. I was way more way more drawn to the character, at that point, because it was not just a two-dimensional character.


--DocBreak--
HARTNETT: I don’t know how he worked with the other actors. I had a lot of stuff that was on my own. I came in with a very specific idea of how I wanted to play Victor, and I think that’s why he wanted to hire me to begin with. He wanted a strong point of view. He left me to do what I wanted to do, but what was great about it, and this doesn’t always happen, was that he had done so much work on the technical side of things, to limit the amount of behind the scenes work that had to be done in between shots, so we were shooting close to the entire time. All of the stuff that I did in Bangkok, we shot in under two weeks. We were able to shoot take after take after take, and shot after shot, without any set up time ‘cause he just decided that he wasn’t gonna use lights. I don’t think I saw a light on this set, the entire time we were filming. It was all practical. And then, there was a bounce card, occasionally. And it was all hand-held and had this feeling of documentary filmmaking. In a way, it needed to be that way, with the budget that we had and the time that we had, and Daniel recognized that. He was a savvy enough filmmaker to understand that this was gonna happen in the performances, and he was able to get great performances from all of his actors, and a new type of character from Jim Gaffigan, and a great performance from Antoine [Olivier Pilon]. He worked hard with the actors, which was excellent. That’s what you want from a director.

Chis loved laughing and wearing a smile on her face. She was a loving and caring person, devoted wife, mother, and friend, always thinking of others first. "To know her was to love her." In her spare time she made homemade gifts to put smiles on other's faces. She could bake Rachel Ray under the table and put Paula Dean to shame with her home cooked meals. She made bibs for new mothers, masks for whom ever needed them and just to give away, sewed covers for the server books for her co-workers, and would whip up a batch of goodies for someone's birthday. It didn't matter who you were, she put her whole heart and a lot of thought into whatever she was doing. She would relax in her recliner and knit or crochet while watching a cooking show, thinking of some new wonderful way to brighten someone's day. Her smile was always pure and her laugh was extremely contagious. If you were ever affected, then you have been blessed.

HARTNETT: I love Guy’s films. His early films were very quickly indoctrinated into the canon. He was such a big deal, in the late ‘90s and early 2000s, and has done such varied and wild work since then. He’s a wordsmith. He’s on set, constantly changing the dialogue. He wants to hear it said out loud. It feels very off the cuff, almost, but it’s basically him filtering everything on set, which is fantastic. In my opinion, that’s when filmmaking is at its best, when it’s coming from a point of view of a very strong director. I loved working on that film. I have no idea how my character is gonna turn it out, but I’m excited to see it.
