The deal has already received support from the NHL Players' Association, and features a 56-game regular season beginning Jan. 13. Training camps for the seven teams that didn't qualify for the playoffs last season would open Dec. 31, with the remaining 24 teams opening camps Jan. 3.
 The Sharks missed the playoffs, and their status is in limbo because Santa Clara County has banned contact sports through at least Jan. 8. The Sharks will follow in the steps of the NFL's San Francisco 49ers, who are closing out their season in Arizona.
 The Sharks said they had no comment "at this point" on relocating to Arizona.
 In an email to the AP, NHL Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly deferred questions to the Sharks regarding their status. Daly added he was unable to share many details of the plan because the league has yet to brief its general managers.
 As for the issues affecting the Canadian teams — Montreal, Toronto, Ottawa, Winnipeg, Calgary, Edmonton, Vancouver — Daly said they remain unresolved. Discussions are to continue through the weekend.
 If health officials approve the NHL's plan, the seven teams would compete in a new Canadian Division.
 "The resumption of sports events in Canada must be undertaken in adherence to Canada's measures to mitigate the importation and spread of COVID-19," the Public Health Agency of Canada said in a statement Thursday night. "NHL teams and other professional sports must operate within the rules of their provincial jurisdictions for sports or sporting events."

Merín gave birth to her daughter next to the Rio Grande, attended to by two Border Patrol agents, showing how lives routinely end up at risk at the U.S.-Mexico border.
 Increasing numbers of parents and children are crossing the border, driven by violence and poverty in Central America and growing desperation in migrant camps in Mexico. While crossings have not reached the levels seen in previous years, facilities that hold migrants are approaching capacity, which has been reduced because of the coronavirus pandemic.
 U.S. Customs and Border Protection said Monday that it made roughly 4,500 apprehensions of unaccompanied immigrant children in November, more than six times the figure in April. In South Texas' Rio Grande Valley, children and their parents are usually taken to a small station where some young people report having to use old masks and being detained in cramped quarters.
 Merín and her daughter are safe after she gave birth on Nov. 22.
 "They treated me well, thank God," said Merín, who didn't want her last name used because she fears retribution if she's forced to leave the country.
 Agents Chris Croy and Raul Hernandez were called to help by another agent who found her. Merín said the first agent told her to get up and keep walking, but she couldn't. She says he accused her of lying.
 "When I look, I see the head of a child," Croy said. "I just kneel down to go ahead and support the child's head."
 Hernandez saw that Merín's clothing was obstructing the baby's head. He pulled out a small knife and carefully cut it away. Croy kept hold of the baby's head.
 "She had another big contraction and out came the baby," he said.
 It took another 10 minutes for an ambulance to arrive. Croy and Hernandez took clothes from Merín's bag to keep the baby warm in the meantime.
 Mother and child were hospitalized for three days, then processed at a Border Patrol station before being released to Catholic Charities. They soon boarded a bus to join family in the U.S.
 Hundreds of people die each year trying to cross the border. Photos last year of a father and daughter who drowned trying to cross the Rio Grande — not far from where Merín made her journey — were shared worldwide.
 "There's so many women in great danger," said Sister Norma Pimentel, executive director of Catholic Charities of the Rio Grande Valley. "They must really think before they do what they do and risk the life of their unborn child."

There's a wider effect, too. Politicians undermining official virus messaging could make it harder to get Americans to follow precautions, especially those who may believe COVID-19 isn't that dangerous in a country whose president has been accused of downplaying the virus that's killed over 300,000 people.
 "They're probably less likely to follow COVID safety guidelines," says Jeff Stone, a psychology professor at Arizona State University.
 Some of those with the strongest virus messaging are among the "do as I say, not as I do" crowd. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo planned to host an extended family Thanksgiving until public backlash made him think twice. The California Assembly moved its legislative work to an NBA arena to ensure social distancing, but then a group of lawmakers headed to a restaurant together.
 The backlash is not uniquely American. People were outraged when the chief architect of England's lockdown rules drove from London to his father's seaside home after he and his wife were suspected to have the virus, violating the country's travel rules. He's since lost his job and is now being investigated by police.
 But hypocrisy is perceived differently in cultures that are more individualistic, like the United States, versus those that tend toward being collective. In China, for example, societal norms often tend to skew in favor of promoting social harmony.
 In an individualistic culture, if someone says one thing but does another, "the way they explain that is that the person's trying to fool us ... trying to appear more virtuous than they really are," Effron says. In a collectivist culture, people may forgive the inconsistency if there are explanations for it.
 "It's not that people in Asia are OK with hypocrisy," he says. "It's that saying one thing and doing another does not always count as hypocrisy, it's about trying to do what's right in different situations."
 In a critical time when COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations and deaths are surging in the U.S., leaders have a big responsibility in "selling this message to the public," says San Jose State University political science professor Melinda Jackson.
 California Gov. Gavin Newsom has fielded weeks of questions about whether he's a credible coronavirus messenger after dining out with a group. The Democrat has called it a lapse in judgment but has ignored questions about whether Californians can still trust him. A growing effort to gather enough signatures for a recall vote shows that many have had enough.
 For Bohn, the Illinois woman who's hunkered down, it seems like politicians have forgotten who pays their salary — and who they're supposed to serve.
 "The lack of self-awareness in American politics is just something else," she says. "They lose all sense of what it is to serve a constituency."

This isn’t the “Marvel-ization” of _Star Wars_. Kevin Feige and friends took the time and did the work to make sure that the “new to you” characters were entirely compelling sans whatever connections they might have to the larger world. Audiences embraced the MCU because they liked Chris Evans’ Steve Rogers, Robert Downey Jr.’s Tony Stark, Chris Hemsworth’s Thor and Scarlett Johansson’s Natasha Romanoff (among many others) and relished the opportunity to see them in their own mostly stand-alone feature films. That their worlds eventually intermingled and occasionally collided in a major event was the icing on the cake, not the main course. The events of _The Rise of Skywalker_ and now _The Mandalorian_ argues that the new characters are only worthwhile in terms of their connections to original trilogy characters. Rey only matters because she’s Palpatine’s granddaughter. Mando is only cool in relation to Boba Fett.

Swalwell, 40, has had a meteoric rise in the national Democratic Party, starting with a surprise win over 20-term Congressman Pete Stark (D-Calif.) in 2012. Since then, he has become an increasingly prominent member of Congress, and even launched a short-lived presidential run in 2019, withdrawing before the Democratic primaries started in 2020. According to _Axios_ , Swalwell was just the kind of politician a spy in Fang’s position would look to target. Gaining a foothold with an up and comer was part of the “long game” planned by China, _Axios_ reported, with the goal of influencing broader U.S. policy years down the road. Swalwell reportedly first came into contact with Fang when he worked as a Dublin, California city councilman and she was a member of the Chinese Student Association at California State University East Bay, where she enrolled after coming to the U.S. in 2011. It was reportedly through the student organizations that Fang was able to make connections in political circles, in part by promoting a connection with the large Chinese-American community in the Bay Area. Fang has not been charged by the Department of Justice. She also never directly contributed to Swalwell’s campaign, which would have been illegal since she is a foreign national.

Når man lytter til Paul McCartneys nye album, er det slående, hvor lidt manden gør ud af at gøre status. Han er fyldt 78, og det er ikke tid til at se tilbage – sådan som for eksempel Bruce Springsteen gjorde det på _sit_ corona- lockdown-album ’Letter to You’, der lød som et testamente, hvor alt blev sat på plads.
 Hvad er der også at se tilbage på? En hel del jo. Men så sentimental er Paul McCartney ikke, selv om han jo er den sentimentale type og også er det på sit 18. studiealbum ’McCartney III’ – bare ikke, når det kommer til egne bedrifter. Mere sådan hverdagssentimental. ’Seize the Day’ handler om at være en flink person:
 »It’s still alright to be nice«, synger han, så benene ikke kan komme meget længere ned på jorden.

Boeing hopes to catch up with SpaceX in the astronaut-launching department, while space tourism may finally get off the ground.
 "2021 promises to be as much of a space exploration bright spot, perhaps even more," said Scott Hubbard, NASA's former "Mars Czar" now teaching at Stanford University.
 Although the coronavirus pandemic complicated space operations around the globe in 2020, most high-priority missions remained on track, led by the U.S., China and the United Arab Emirates in a stampede to Mars in July.
 The UAE's first interplanetary spacecraft, an orbiter, will scrutinize the Martian atmosphere. NASA's Perseverance rover is set to land Feb. 18 at an ancient river delta and lakebed where microscopic life may have once flourished. The rover will drill into the dry crust, collecting samples for eventual return to Earth.
 China's orbiter-rover duo Tianwen-1 — quest for heavenly truth — also will hunt for signs of bygone life.
 The European and Russian space agencies skipped the 2020 Mars launch window, their life-sniffing Mars rover grounded until 2022 because of technical issues and COVID-19 restrictions.
 China also set its sights on the moon in 2020, landing and then launching off the lunar surface in December with the first moon rocks collected for return to Earth since the 1970s.
 Japan brought back pieces of asteroid Ryugu — its second asteroid batch in a decade. More asteroid samples are on the way: NASA's Osiris-Rex spacecraft vacuumed up handfuls of gravel from asteroid Bennu in October for return in 2023.
 Elon Musk's SpaceX, meanwhile, was buzzing in 2020. In May, it became the first private company to put people into orbit, an achievement previously claimed by just three global superpowers. The two test pilots were the first NASA astronauts to fly a new brand of spaceship in almost 40 years and the first to blast off from Florida since the shuttle program ended in 2011.
 In November, four more astronauts rode a SpaceX Dragon capsule to the International Space Station. Three weeks later, SpaceX launched its biggest cargo shipment yet to the space station for NASA.
 "This is an impressive achievement which Americans should be proud of," astronaut-turned-senator Mark Kelly said of the Dragon capsule double-header.

“One group we are seeing in the automation space is the ‘hyper-automate everything’ crew, where you can find a lot of the RPA vendors dropping bots on everything that moves. The impact of Covid has driven reduced workforces to look for any help they can get, and in the short term, the automation-fix might feel good but the automation-tax is going to be high once those bots start limping and eventually breaking down. This approach has proven to be brittle and fail when the business changes, because it automates steps regardless of the business context, process situation, management objectives, etc. It ‘assumes’ there is always one way to execute things—which is never the case in business.”

Democrats said Toomey's stand on the Fed would deprive President-elect Joe Biden of crucial tools to manage the economy.
 A new deadline of midnight Sunday for a government shutdown served as a backstop for the tortuous negotiations, which were being conducted in secret largely among the top four leaders in Congress.
 "We need to conclude our talks, draft legislation, and land this plane," said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.
 A spokesman for Pelosi said she told Democratic colleagues on a Saturday conference call that "we're right within reach."
 The massive package would wrap much of Capitol Hill's unfinished 2020 business into a take-it-or-leave-it measure that promises to be a foot thick or more. House lawmakers will probably have only a few hours to study it before voting as early as Sunday afternoon. A Senate vote would follow, probably on Monday. One more short-term funding bill probably would be needed to avoid the looming deadline.
 An agreement in principle Saturday would be a precursor to more hours of translating compromises into detailed legislation. Lawmakers are eager to exit Washington and close out a tumultuous year.
 House lawmakers were told they wouldn't have to report to work on Saturday but that a Sunday session was likely. The Senate scheduled votes on nominations Saturday.
 The $900 billion package comes as the pandemic is delivering its most fearsome surge yet, killing more than 3,000 victims per day and straining the health care system. While vaccines are on the way, most people won't get them for months. Jobless claims are on the rise.
 The emerging agreement would deliver more than $300 billion in aid to businesses and provide the jobless a $300-per-week bonus federal unemployment benefit and renewal of state benefits that would otherwise expire right after Christmas. It includes $600 direct payments to individuals; vaccine distribution funds and money for renters, schools, the Postal Service and people needing food aid.

Until the SpaceX flights, Russia's three-person Soyuz capsules were the only way to get astronauts to the space station once NASA's shuttles shut down.
 NASA's other hired crew transporter, Boeing, is scrambling to get its Starliner capsule back in action after a software-spoiled test flight in December 2019. The do-over — again with no one on board — is targeted for spring. If the repairs work and the capsule finally reaches the space station, the first Starliner astronauts could be flying by summer.
 Musk capped the year with a stratospheric test flight of Starship, the rocketship he's building to carry people to the moon and Mars. The Dec. 9 demo went better than anyone imagined until a fiery explosion at touchdown. Even so, Musk was ecstatic.
 At the same time, SpaceX is expanding its Dragon-riding clientele. Late next year, SpaceX expects to launch the first privately financed Dragon flight in a deal arranged by Houston-based Axiom Space.
 Axiom's Michael Lopez-Alegria, an ex-NASA astronaut and former president of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation, will accompany Israeli businessman Eytan Stibbe and two other paying customers to the space station. Stibbe, a former fighter pilot, was a close friend of Israel's first astronaut, Ilan Ramon, who died aboard space shuttle Columbia in 2003.
 Will Tom Cruise be joining them? The actor was in talks with NASA this year about filming a movie at the space station.
 "This is the true beginning of private spaceflight and will get the ball rolling toward multiple private missions to orbit per year," Lopez-Alegria said in an email. "I've been preaching for almost a decade __ that commercial human spaceflight is the next giant leap."
 Two other space-travel companies — Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin and Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic — are still conducting test flights and have yet to set firm dates for launching customers on short flights to the edge of space and back.
 NASA is still targeting a November debut of its new moon rocket, the Space Launch System, with an Orion capsule that will launch without a crew. The Trump administration had set a 2024 deadline for the first moon landing by astronauts since NASA's Apollo program a half-century ago. Just this month, NASA introduced the 18 astronauts who will train for the moon program named for Artemis, the mythological twin sister of Apollo.
 It remains to be seen how President-elect Joe Biden might alter the lunar- landing program.
 "Whatever else can be said about the four years of the Trump administration, they have been positive for the U.S. civilian space program," noted John Logsdon, professor emeritus at George Washington University's Space Policy Institute. "No prior major programs were cancelled, the human exploration program was given clear direction, and funding for existing programs was increased."
 "This is a legacy that the Biden administration can build on, so that in future years there can be a continued string of successes."
