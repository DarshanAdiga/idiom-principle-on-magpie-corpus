HOLLAND, MI - Sunshine and warm temperatures might make it seem like a perfect beach day Sunday, but dangerous swim conditions and strong currents are forecast to develop in Lake Michigan along several popular beaches during the day.
 The National Weather Service has issued a Beach Hazards statement for today, saying an increasing north wind will build waves up to 6 feet at some beaches, overtopping piers. It may develop into the kind of conditions where drownings are more likely to occur, forecasters said.
 “The juxtaposition of fairly good weather, waves of the height that produce the most drownings (3 to 6 feet) and a (July) weekend make Sunday a concern,” NWS meteorologists in Grand Rapids said in their forecast notes. “Folks are urged to stay dry when waves are high and steer clear of the pier! North sides of piers will be dangerous places to swim.”
 The beach hazard conditions will start Sunday morning in Mason and Oceana counties, and develop in the afternoon and evening from the Silver Lake area all the way south to St. Joe, NWS said.
 Winds are expected to increase up to 30 mph out of the north as the day progresses.
 A small craft advisory also will be in effect.
 Authorities are urging caution after a recent spate of drownings. Over the Fourth of July weekend, three people died in separate water incidents in Northern Michigan. A teen died in Lake Michigan while swimming to a sandbar off the coast of Sleeping Bear Dunes, a man died while swimming after a jet ski that had come loose from a boat in Grand Traverse Bay, and another man died in an inland lake.
 So far in 2020, there have been at least 30 drownings on the Great Lakes. More than half of those have occurred in Lake Michigan, according to the Great Lakes Surf Rescue Project, a group that tracks drownings across the region and advocates for lifeguards.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice Department filed an emergency motion with a federal appeals court on Saturday seeking to move forward with the first federal execution in nearly two decades.Daniel Lee, 47, had been scheduled to die by lethal injection on Monday at a federal prison in Indiana. He was convicted in Arkansas of the 1996 killings of gun dealer William Mueller, his wife, Nancy, and her 8-year-old daughter, Sarah Powell.But Chief District Judge Jane Magnus-Stinson ruled Friday in Indiana that the execution would be put on hold because of concerns from the family of the victims about the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than 130,000 people and is ravaging prisons nationwide.The Justice Department is seeking to immediately overturn that ruling. In the emergency motion to the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, it argues that the judge's order "misconstrues both federal and state law and has no basis in equity" and asks the appeals court to permit the government to carry out the execution on Monday afternoon. "The capital sentence at issue here — imposed for the murder of an eight-year-old and her parents during a robbery to fund a white supremacist movement — has been repeatedly upheld by federal courts, and the inmate's own efforts to halt its implementation have very recently been rejected by this Court and the Supreme Court," prosecutors wrote in the filing. In response, lawyers for the victims' family said the relatives "need no reminder of the gruesome details of those crimes." The Justice Department also argues that while the Bureau of Prisons has taken measures to accommodate the family and implemented additional safety protocols because of the pandemic, the family's concerns "do not outweigh the public interest in finally carrying out the lawfully imposed sentence in this case." The relatives would be traveling thousands of miles and witnessing the execution in a small room where the social distancing recommended to prevent the virus' spread is virtually impossible. There are currently four confirmed coronavirus cases among inmates at the Terre Haute prison, according to federal statistics, and one inmate there has died. The family argues it isn't trying to overturn Lee's death sentence but instead they "seek to exercise their lawful rights to attend the execution of Lee, so that they can be together at that moment in time as they grieve their losses," according to the filing. The family hopes there won't be an execution, ever. They have asked the Justice Department and President Donald Trump not to move forward with the execution and have long asked that he be given a life sentence instead.The relatives, including Earlene Branch Peterson, who lost her daughter and granddaughter in the killing, have argued that their grief is compounded by the push to execute Lee in the middle of a pandemic. Peterson, who is 81 and has not left the county where she lives since February, was told by her doctor she should not travel and should avoid contact with others as much as possible to during the pandemic, the filing said. "Plaintiffs face the unacceptable choice between exercising their right to witness the execution and risking exposure to a deadly disease," the lawyers wrote. Attorney General William Barr told The Associated Press this week that he believes the Bureau of Prisons could "carry out these executions without being at risk." The agency has put a number of additional measures in place, including temperature checks and requiring witnesses to wear masks.The injunction that was imposed late Friday delays the execution until there is no longer such an emergency. The court order applies only to Lee's execution and does not halt two other executions that are scheduled for later next week.The decision to resume executions has been criticized as a dangerous and political move. Critics argue that the government is creating an unnecessary and manufactured urgency around a topic that isn't high on the list of American concerns right now.The federal prisons system has struggled in recent months to stem the exploding coronavirus pandemic behind bars. As of Friday, more than 7,000 federal inmates had tested positive; the Bureau of Prisons said 5,137 of them had recovered. There have also been nearly 100 inmate deaths since late March.Copyright 2020 Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Since then, zonal railways have uploaded their entries on the web portal.From September 2018 to December 2019, the portal received 2,645 entries.Of which, the Board has identified 20 for initial mass scale implementation across the railway network, according to an order issued by it on July 10.An official said that an order has been issued to all zonal general managers and production units to gear up for the implementation of these ideas.Most of the 20 innovations are aimed at technical improvements to boost safety.The North Central Railway has developed a vehicular system for ultrasonic flaw detection of rails, which is currently done manually. The Malda division of Eastern Railway has used pyrometers to monitor speed and temperature of tracks. The carriage and wagon department of Allahabad division of North Central Railway has developed a detector for hot axle box in running trains much before a possible derailment due to seizure.Some of the innovations are also directed at passenger comfort.The Western Railway has developed natural water coolers, with zero electric consumption, each at a cost of Rs 1.25 lakh and a lifespan of ten years. The system works on principle of heat transfer where water is passed through copper coils which are covered with cooling fabric active through a water dripping system. These coolers have been installed at Borivali, Dahanu Road, Nandurbar, Udhana and Bandra railway stations.A bell system -- developed by Allahabad division -- alerts passengers at platforms that the train is ready to depart within two minutes and they should occupy their seats. This is already in use on platform number one of Allahabad junction railway station.On the list is also a system to monitor real-time CCTV footage on board trains. While the coaches in Humsafar trains have CCTV surveillance, the footage is not monitored in real time. The NCR has developed a system for real-time monitoring inside trains and has installed it in all 18 coaches of Humsafar trains.The CCTV display unit is provided in the guard's compartment and the videos can be recorded and viewed later; it is aimed at quick resolution of crimes on board trains.Another innovation the Railways is looking at is air quality monitoring equipment developed by NCR and installed at Allahabad railway station.With the coronavirus pandemic encouraging people to go contact-less, the Northern Railway developed a system through which they issued unreserved tickets through mobile apps and bluetooth printers.This pilot project helped Railways to open online UTS ticketing counters at stations, platforms, tent cities and passenger holding areas without UTS connectivity and uninterrupted power supply as these devices work on lithium- ion batteries and SIM cards.The Railway Board has instructed the zones to furnish implementation reports of these 20 innovations within the next three months.

 As customers flocked in from Milan, where the coronavirus had already taken hold, “the big question for the French, who otherwise kiss constantly at trade shows, was whether to give la bise — the double kiss,” Ehrlich said.

A tuberculose é causada pela bactéria _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_. A vacina contra ela é feita, no entanto, a partir de outra espécie, a _Mycobacterium bovis_ , que, como o nome sugere, ataca bovinos.
 "Mas as suas cepas mais virulentas também podem infectar o ser humano", diz Oliveira. "Para fazer o imunizante, ela é atenuada, enfraquecida." Então, ela passa a se chamar bacilo Calmette-Guérin, daí o seu famoso nome, BCG.
 O projeto da vacina contra a covid-19 começou em março, baseado nas pesquisas que o grupo realizava anteriormente com a BCG.
 Oliveira diz que estudos recentes realizados em outros países demonstraram que indivíduos que foram imunizados contra a tuberculose e que vieram a contrair a covid-19 não desenvolveram a forma mais grave da doença. "Isso sugere que a BCG pode ser utilizada no combate à covid-19, por meio de uma vacina dupla como nós estamos pretendendo", explica.
 Um artigo publicado em maio na revista científica Nature Reviews Immunology aponta que "estudos ecológicos sugerem que países e regiões que obrigam a vacinação da BCG para sua população têm um número de infecções e uma mortalidade reduzida da covid-19. Embora isso possa sugerir um efeito protetor da vacinação da BCG, tais estudos não proveem prova definitiva de causalidade".
 O Brasil, por exemplo, tem uma alta cobertura de vacinação pela BCG, e ao mesmo tempo é o 2º país com o maior número de casos e mortes por covid-19 no mundo - mas isso, segundo especialistas, pode ter relação com a baixa taxa de isolamento social, com as desigualdades sociais do país e com a dissonância entre as recomendações de saúde feitas por diferentes entes de governo.
 Oliveira afirma que os pesquisadores irão clonar genes do novo coronavírus e irão introduzi-los no bacilo Calmette-Guérin, para que ele passe a produzir proteínas do agente causador da covid-19 e, assim, imunizar as pessoas quando elas forem vacinadas.
 De acordo com ele, essa abordagem apresenta várias vantagens, dentre as quais duas se destacam.
 "A primeira é que o imunizante usado hoje para controle da tuberculose é extremamente seguro", explica.
 "Ele já vem sendo utilizado há décadas em diversos países e bilhões de indivíduos já foram imunizados sem nenhum efeito colateral ou adverso. Então, a biossegurança dele é uma das grandes vantagens."
 Aliado a isso, Oliveira lembra que a BCG está dentro do programa de vacinação do Ministério da Saúde. "Isto é, nós, brasileiros, já a tomamos normalmente."
 ## Esperando verbas
 Embora o projeto tenha sido aprovado pelo Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (CNPq), a equipe ainda não recebeu os recursos.
 "Nós estamos tocando o trabalho com outras verbas, porque sabemos da importância dessa pesquisa", conta Oliveira.

Iran said that the misalignment of an air defence unit's radar system was the key "human error" that led to the accidental downing of a Ukrainian passenger plane in January.
 "A failure occurred due to a human error in following the procedure" for aligning the radar, causing a "107-degree error" in the system, the Iranian Civil Aviation Organisation (CAO) said in a report late Saturday.
 This error "initiated a hazard chain" that saw further mistakes committed in the minutes before the plane was shot down, said the CAO document, presented as a "factual report" and not as the final report on the accident investigation.
 Flight 752, a Ukraine International Airlines jetliner, was struck by two missiles and crashed shortly after taking off from Tehran's main airport on January 8, at a time of heightened US-Iranian tensions.
 The Islamic republic admitted several days later that its forces accidentally shot down the Kiev-bound plane, killing all 176 people on board.
 The majority of the passengers on the Boeing 737 were Iranians, with Canadians, Ukrainians, Afghans, Britons and Swedes also aboard.
 \- 'Wrong identification' -
 The CAO said that, despite the erroneous information available to the radar system operator on the aircraft's trajectory, he could have identified it as an airliner, but instead there was a "wrong identification".
 The report also noted that the first of the two missiles launched at the aircraft was fired by a defence unit operator who had acted "without receiving any response from the Coordination Center" on which he depended.
 The second missile was fired 30 seconds later, "by observing the continuity of (the) trajectory of the detected target," the report added.
 The CAO said there was a defect in the transmission to the defence units coordination centre of the data identified by the radar.
 An Iranian general had said in January that many communications had been jammed that night.
 Tehran's air defences had been on high alert at the time the jet was shot down in case the US retaliated against Iranian strikes hours earlier on American troops stationed in Iraq.
 Those strikes were carried out in response to the killing of a top Iranian general, Qasem Soleimani, in a US drone attack near Baghdad airport.

 The aircraft tragedy sparked fierce reprobation in Iran, especially after it took three days for the armed forces to admit having shot down the plane "by accident" after a missile operator mistook it for an enemy projectile.
 Ottowa and Kiev have demanded for months that Iran, which does not have the technical means to decode the black boxes, send them abroad so their contents can be analysed.
 In late June, France's Accident Investigation Bureau (BEA) said Iran had "officially requested technical assistance" to retrieve the black box data.
 Work on the Cockpit Voice Recorder and the Flight Data Recorder "should begin on July 20," according to the BEA.
 In early July, Canada announced that it had reached an agreement in principle with Iran to launch negotiations on compensation for the families of foreign victims of the accident.
