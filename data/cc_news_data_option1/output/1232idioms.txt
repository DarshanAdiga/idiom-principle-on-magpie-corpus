President Donald Trump offered a preview of his re-election campaign playbook last year when he visited the building site of a multi-billion-dollar cracking unit in western Pennsylvania, hailed as one of the largest construction projects in the country. At some U.S. hospitals, drugs, catheters, oxygen tanks run low
 It's not just protective facemasks that are in short supply: health workers in U.S. hospitals are reporting dwindling stocks of drugs, catheters and other medical miscellany vital for caring for a surge in patients stricken by the coronavirus outbreak. Marney Gruber, a doctor who works in emergency rooms around New York City, said a number of commonly used medications are in short supply, and at least one hospital had run out of central line kits, which are used to administer drugs to patients in intensive care. U.S. ventilator makers pull out all stops to fight coronavirus
 As U.S. demand for ventilators skyrockets during the coronavirus pandemic, smaller medical device makers are simplifying their designs and pushing other work aside to make more of the devices. The United States had equipment to help patients breathe when they can no longer do so on their own to about 160,000 people, according to research compiled by the Johns Hopkins Center for Health and Security. New Yorkers irked to feel unwelcome in states fearing coronavirus spread
 Many New Yorkers say they are miffed at being treated as the poster children of the U.S. coronavirus outbreak, unwelcome in some states even if they are symptom-free. This week, Rhode Island, Florida and West Virginia appeared to roll up the welcome mats to residents of the Empire State. As virus threatens, U.S. embraces big government, for now
 It may, as House Majority Leader and Maryland Democrat Steny Hoyer said on Friday, be out of love that the United States agreed to shut down much of its economy to stop a viral epidemic and save lives. It may, as Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said, be out of necessity that the federal government agreed to foot the bill. Coronavirus outbreak is stretching New York's ambulance service to breaking point
 By Scot Paltrow The coronavirus outbreak sweeping through New York City has pushed its ambulance service close to the breaking point, with hundreds of personnel out ill and emergency calls skyrocketing, supervisors and rank-and- file emergency medical technicians said on Friday. Pentagon eyes Chicago, Michigan, Florida, Louisiana as coronavirus spreads
 The U.S. military is watching coronavirus infection trends in Chicago, Michigan, Florida and Louisiana with concern as it weighs where else it may need to deploy, after boosting aid to New York, California and Washington, a top general said on Friday. Air Force General John Hyten, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the military was doing its own analysis as well as looking at data on infections compiled elsewhere in the government. America's civil rights leader Joseph Lowery dies, aged 98
 The Reverend Joseph Lowery, a key ally of Martin Luther King in the U.S. civil rights movement of the 1960s, died late on Friday at the age of 98, his family said in a statement. "Our beloved, Rev. Dr. Joseph Echols Lowery, made his transition peacefully at home at 10 p.m., Friday, March 27, at the age of 98. He was surrounded by his daughters," Lowery's family said. As U.S. virus cases exceed 100,000, doctors decry scarcity of drugs and equipment
 The sum of known coronavirus U.S. cases soared well past 100,000, with more than 1,600 dead, as weary doctors and nurses coping with shortages resorted to extremes ranging from hiding scarce medical supplies to buying them on the black market. American healthcare workers in the trenches of the pandemic appealed on Friday for more protective gear and equipment to treat a surge in patients that is already pushing hospitals to their limits in virus hot spots such as New York City, New Orleans and Detroit.

The head of UEFA said European football leagues were still looking at all options and not ruling out finishing this season -- if the coronavirus pandemic subsides. We could start again in mid-May, in June or even late June, Aleksander Ceferin told Italys La Repubblica daily.Any time after that and the season will probably be lost, he said. The idea of the entire season simply being cancelled stirs panic in fans of clubs such as Liverpool -- on the cusp of lifting their first title in 30 years.Ceferin did not say when UEFA will issue a final ruling and stressed that consultations with the main leagues and clubs were still underway. There is also a proposal to end this season at the beginning of the next one and then start the next one a little later, said Ceferin.The Slovenian added that he personally opposed the idea of holding big matches behind closed doors. Belarus remain the only European nation still playing football in the face of a pandemic that has officially claimed around 28,000 lives worldwide.Italy suspended its Serie A season on March 9. Its world-leading toll from the novel coronavirus officially stands at 9,134.

Bradley and the Blackfeet Stockgrowers Association have been holding meetings across the Rocky Mountain Front trying to convince ranchers focused on delisting to turn their attention to finding ways to reduce run-ins with bears. But tools to do that are expensive. A trained guard dog could run $5,000 or more and an electric fence around a calving lot can easily cost over $10,000 depending on the size. That price tag can be a huge turnoff to ranchers already having a hard time staying in the black.

West Ham has eight players in self-isolation after showing mild symptoms of the coronavirus, according to the clubs vice-chairwoman Karren Brady. The Hammers are the latest Premier League club to be hit by the pandemic.Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta, Chelsea winger Callum Hudson-Odoi both now recovered and several unnamed Leicester players tested positive for the virus. I am relieved to say they are all showing mild symptoms and, along with their families, seem to be well, Brady told The Sun newspaper on Saturday.But it is no more than a handshake, sneeze or cough away from any of us, so no one should be complacent. West Hams players are training at home and the club hopes to resume regular sessions at its base when Britains lockdown period ends on April 13. The Premier League season is suspended until at least April 30, with reports suggesting there will be a further delay or even cancellation of the remaining fixtures.But Brady hopes the domestic season can resume and reach a conclusion, even if games have to be played behind closed doors until July. When we - all Prem clubs - last spoke, we agreed to get going again as soon as possible, Brady said.And that games will run into July, if required, to get this campaign finished. This is the plan. This is what we want to deliver. It may be games have to be played behind closed doors, which no one wants - especially the players and fans.But we hope it might just be possible to go ahead once the sharp graph of it bottoms out..
