ABU DHABI, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News / WAM - 19th Nov, 2020) The UAE believes in the importance of dialogue and in shaping what this region could look like for many generations to come, said Reem bint Ibrahim Al Hashemy, Minister of State for International Cooperation, stressing that, ''We are committed to a two-state solution in a middle East that will fight extremism and that believes in plurality, multiculturalism, the right of minorities, and the opportunities that exist for young people by embracing technology, innovation, and economic empowerment.'' Al Hashemy was speaking on the impact of the historic Abraham Accords for the UAE and Israel during a high-level online roundtable discussion, exploring the advancement of UAE-Israel, regional, and Muslim-Jewish cooperation, hosted by the Emirates Society, the UK-based institution focused on strengthening ties between the UK and UAE on economic, political and cultural affairs.
 Representing the UAE at the event, she spoke alongside Ban Ki-moon, the 8th UN Secretary-General, and Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis, Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth.
 She continued by noting that the UAE feels that "the Middle East struggles with so many challenges, and youth here deserve to explore what a better future could look like."
 Ban Ki-moon’s remarks reflected on the role of multilateral organisations, the importance of religious tolerance, and how lessons from the Abraham Accords can be applied to other longstanding issues. According to Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, the Abraham Accords offer a "cooperative space not only for leaders but also for citizens of all the participating countries."
 He continued, "The architects of this important agreement must ensure that the Accords are not an agreement just for their countries, but for their people. The Abraham Accords should serve as a launchpad for the sustainable peace and prosperity in the region."
 Providing an important perspective on the importance of advancing Jewish- Muslim relations as part of a broader interfaith effort to secure peace in the Middle East and beyond, Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis commented, "The Abraham Accords have unlocked a range of exciting opportunities for closer political, economic, and diplomatic collaboration between the UAE and the State of Israel.
