Qué es lo que más te inquieta de todo lo que está pasando?   —La estupidez. Pero en términos generales. La estupidez de cometer errores que cuestan vidas. La estupidez de los necios que se distraen, como nos ha pasado en algún momento a todos, con estas teorías conspirativas sobre de dónde viene [el virus] y hacia dónde va o si es una guerra bacteriológica o económica. Lo cierto es que estamos metidos todos en la misma sopa y lo que tenemos que hacer es resolver el día a día. Me inquieta mucho que no detectemos exactamente qué es lo que está ocurriendo. Y también me inquieta muchísimo el no poder ayudar más. Hay una gran, profunda, desigualdad en el mundo y en este caso lo vamos a sentir de forma muy dolorosa. Hay mucha gente que no va a cambiar, la acumulación de la riqueza se va a seguir produciendo. En este momento, aunque no lo podamos creer, hay gente que se está haciendo multimillonaria por esto. Cuesta creerlo, pero es así.

Even though it has not been tested, it is obvious that the particular provision of CAMA 2020’s intendment is to curtail the massive looting, money laundering and manipulation by Nigerian pastors. They explore and exploit the hopelessness in the land brought about by equally wicked and selfish successive governments and use the twine of prosperity and blissful eternal life to empty the wallets of their congregants at Bible-point. If not, the sensationalist harangue of this provision of CAMA 2020 is needless, unless the church barons are admitting that they are running the churches fraudulently. Hyping the narrative that, by virtue of the law, the “Islamist government” wanted to appoint “unbelievers” to preside over the church will not hold water. This is because the provisions are not ambiguous at all. Only fraudulently-run churches need to be afraid.

 "And then we kind of let it go on, and then he just continued to do it and that was it. So that was probably the most defining moment, when he decided that we would all be a family.”

The iPhone SE may not have the same triple camera setup found on the iPhone 11 Pro, but its single camera can still take shots that belie its affordable price tag.

 Being the generous sort I am, I've put together my top tips here.

 To achieve its lower price tag, the iPhone SE ditched the multi-camera array of its pricier sibling. While that's easier on the wallet, it naturally limits the shooting options you'll have when you're out and about. You won't be able to switch to the ultrawide lens to capture everything in front of you, nor can you zoom in on specific details using the telephoto lens.

Converse arguments from the gap-toothed General that membership of the OIC does not necessarily transform a country into an Islamic nation did not hold water in the ecumenical din. With a combination of pastoral blackmail, peppered with apt verses of the Bible, massive power of mass communication of the pulpit and the gullibility of Christendom of the time, no one was interested in looking at the veracity of this ecumenical claim. It may not be an understatement that Nigerian Christian religionists shook the Babangida government to its foundation. Subsequently, Babangida was forced to publicly announce the withdrawal of Nigeria from the organization.

If you are like me, you are sick and tired of the COVID. For those who have had it and recovered, life is unsure as they deal with the aftereffects. For those who have actually lost a loved one, the devastation will last for a long time, and that loved one's passing will never be forgotten -- particularly because most of them died alone, no relatives hovering nearby, no comforting hugs, just a bed in a strange room with no familiar faces.
   
 In previous years, to have loved ones barred from being with a dying mother or father would have been considered elder abuse. One woman wrote on the internet that her mother was isolated in a nursing home. Daughter could NOT go visit; just talk on the phone. As her mother's voice grew weaker, she asked the nurse to have a doctor check her. To make a long story short, the doctor's visit was scheduled for Sunday morning, but the mother died Sunday morning. NOW the daughter was told she could come into the nursing home "to say her good-byes!"
   
 Of course, Mom couldn't say hers; she was gone. Now, why couldn't the family come in during that previous week? COVID scare? What happened to worrying about the COVID when they were admitted to see their dead mother? Like I said, ELDER ABUSE. Awful. Uncaring. Horrible! Unthinkable!
   
 I have on my desk a copy of a CDC report from July of this year. It has a graph on page 2 showing the COVID deaths from Feb. 1, 2020, through July 11, 2020. They peak very quickly in late April, then slide down to nearly nothing by July 11. The most interesting part of this report, however, is at the bottom of page 1. It says, and I quote "Table 1, Deaths involving coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia, and influenza reported to NCHS by sex and age group, United States, Week ending 2-1-2020 to 7-11-2020. Do you notice something that we have never been told? YES! ALL deaths from pneumonia AND influenza are included in the COVID-19 report. I looked up how many die from the flu each year. In the last 10 years, between 12,000 and 61,000 died annually. So, taking away an average of 37,000 deaths just from flu leaves the COVID number considerably lower. Not to mention that many deaths from other causes have been labeled as "COVID" deaths, bringing the actual count much lower. There is someone skewing the figures on purpose, I believe.
   
 I do not understand what is happening in our country. Too many are scared, timid, unsure and a lot of people are angry. I've noticed speeding drivers taking risks; waiters are tongue-lashed for no reason; policemen and women maligned for doing their job; you can't smile at fellow shoppers because you both have masks on. Life has become grim for too many.
   
 But there is GOOD NEWS! God already knew all about this virus and He still loves each one of us. "For God so loved the world, He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through Him." John 3:16, 17 In the chaos of national and world events -- God wants us to trust Him, with our businesses, our families, our lives. HE is trustworthy!
