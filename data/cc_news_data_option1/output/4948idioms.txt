For example, human rights law is useful in setting widely applicable minimum standards. Human rights law is both binding and universal, and offers a common vocabulary and set of principles that can be applied across borders and cultures to ensure AI is serving human interests and promoting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The international human rights regime also offers a set of mechanisms for accountability and enforcement, from working groups and special rapporteurs to the International Court of Justice, reducing the need to start from scratch in applying these principles to AI. But it can take time for human rights jurisprudence to develop the specificity necessary to regulate emerging technology. Moreover, states or companies may wish to elevate their ethical standards to an even higher level than that required by human rights law. In such cases, ethics can be very helpful.

Leaders in rural Southwestern Ontario communities are urging residents of COVID-19 red zones and lockdown regions to take precautions before heading to cottage country.
 Or better yet, just stay home.
 "There are currently no official restrictions on travel among regions. There are only the restrictions we place on ourselves as we consider the impact of our movement between and among regions of Ontario," Joyce Lock, Southwestern Public Health's medical officer of health, said in an email.
 "Please consider postponing any non-essential travel."
 Although indoor gatherings are still capped at 10 people, Lock said "the safest choice is to avoid close contact with people who don't live with you."
 Earlier in the week, Premier Doug Ford asked Ontarians to stay home for the holidays and celebrate only with those they live with.
 Lock isn't saying cottage owners must stay home, but they should keep within their household group.
 "If you have a vacation property, such as a home or cottage on Lake Erie, please go straight to your property, bringing your own groceries with you to limit time spent in local businesses," she said.
 Southwestern Public Health, which covers Oxford and Elgin counties, was in the orange-restrict tier of the province's COVID-19 restriction framework when Lock made her comments.
 Huron County Warden Jim Ginn said he's less worried about seasonal property owners travelling from lockdown areas to their Lake Huron cottages, and more about groups from different regions mixing for holiday gatherings.
 "We don't have concerns if they come and stay there, as long as they follow health protocols," he said. "Kids coming home from university . . . (and) young adults coming back for Christmas at their homes, that is certainly a concern."
 Ginn said any day-trippers coming to the area must follow public health protocols.
 "We had a lot of visitors from outside over the summertime and we remained fine. Our (COVID-19) numbers were quite acceptable," he said. "Now that we are in orange, there may not be as much of a pull as there was through the summer."
 Huron-Perth and Southwestern health regions have both seen increases in COVID cases, which is something Elgin County Warden Dave Mennill said potential visitors should consider.
 "I'm afraid that if we continue on this trend, we may be going from orange to red," he said.
 Ginn hopes people heed the message to hunker down at home for the holidays.
 "As much as you want to be with family, anytime there are outsiders coming into the area, it just puts everyone at risk," he said. "Stay home at Christmas. Keep within your own bubble. You might have to sacrifice until the next holiday, but it may be well worthwhile."

A spokesperson for Inhofe told Fox News on Tuesday that the senator is also frustrated by a lack of coronavirus relief and said he has supported passing an additional package.
 "May I suggest they try sharing their concerns with Speaker Pelosi or Sen. Schumer? They are the ones holding up relief - not Sen. Inhofe," the spokesperson told Fox News.
 Graham did not respond to Newsweek's request for comment about the body bags.
 The South Carolina lawmaker has previously suggested Congress should go "big and smart" on the next relief package, saying more money is needed than what other Republicans had supported but objecting to certain provisions proposed by House Democrats, The Hill reported.
 McConnell on Monday expressed support for passing another relief package.
 "The American people need more help now," he tweeted. "Congress should deliver more COVID relief this year."
 He also said there is "no reason" why lawmakers "should not deliver another major pandemic relief package to help the American people," according to Business Insider. Congress reconvened Monday, and McConnell told reporters Tuesday that if a deal is reached on a government funding bill, a COVID-19 relief package will likely be included.
 Meanwhile, a bipartisan congressional group that includes Collins, introduced their proposal for a $908 billion relief package on Tuesday, Politico reports.
 "This bipartisan, bicameral group worked night and day throughout the Thanksgiving recess because we recognize that families all across America are struggling, that businesses are closing, and that hospitals are overwhelmed," Collins said in a statement about the proposal.
 Lawmakers have been in a stalemate for months over another relief package -- unable to reach an agreement on the price tag and on certain key aspects to include.
 House Democrats in May passed the HEROES Act, a $3 trillion package that was never voted on in the Senate. Republicans in the Senate passed their own $1 trillion package, the HEALS Act in July.
 Negotiations have since been on again, off again. In November, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer sent McConnell a letter asking him to "join us at the negotiating table" after talks hit another dead end.

The Elliots marvel that while the pizza we eat today was invented in Naples in the late 1800s, other cultures have their own versions, from one with spiced ground meat in Lebanon to a baguette topped with mushrooms and cheese in Poland.
 “All these countries came up with this on their own. And that is the definition of a good idea, right?” James said. “It’s a bit like the way so many cultures created beer independently. Just great ideas make it through.”
 The brothers include sections on controversial ingredients — pineapple, that’s you — and which drinks to pair with a slice, as well as the various ways people can eat it, from rolling it into a cigar to a technique called the “snag and drag.”
 They present the info without judgment, refusing to weigh in on whether coal ovens are better than wood or if buffalo milk is better than cow milk for making mozzarella.
 “There’s that saying: There’s two kinds of people in the world — people that love ABBA and liars,” James said. “Not all music has to be high and mighty in the same way that not all pizza has to be high and mighty. You can love different songs and different pizzas for all kinds of different reasons.”
 The origins of the book began when the brothers ditched their regular jobs in 2012 to go to Naples and learn all about pizza. They traveled the length of Italy and the world and, once educated in all things delicious, came back to the United Kingdom to open a chain of pizzerias, Pizza Pilgrims.
 In Chicago, they encountered that city's famous, dense variation.

AJ Garcia, Managing Director of The Bleeding Heart, cited the reasons for creating a gin. Of course he mentioned the huge consumption of gin in this country (one of the biggest in the world), but there was more. “It’s a pretty simple, straightforward distillation process, but at the same time, aside from juniper, which is the key botanical, you have such an array of different options to be able to create new flavors and profiles.
