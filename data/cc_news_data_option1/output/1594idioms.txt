BLADEN COUNTY, N.C. (WECT) - An Elizabethtown store was fined by the N.C. Department of Agriculture &amp; Consumer Services for “excessive price-scanner errors.”The Family Dollar located at 304 S. Poplar St. has paid $1,035 in penalties.“The department conducts periodic, unannounced inspections of price-scanner systems in businesses to check for accuracy between the prices advertised and the prices that ring up at the register,” a news release states. “If a store has more than a 2-percent error rate on overcharges, inspectors discuss the findings with the store manager and conduct a more intensive follow-up inspection at a later date.”An initial inspection of the Elizabethtown Family Dollar last November found a 12-percent error rate based on six overcharges in a 50-item order. A followup inspection in December 2019 found a 3 percent error rate based on nine overcharges in a 300-item order.The store passed inspection in February.“The price on the shelf and the price at the register should match,” said Agriculture Commissioner Steve Troxler. “Stores have a responsibility to make sure their pricing is accurate, and most stores pass inspection. Ones with errors face fines until they come into compliance.”Copyright 2020 WECT. All rights reserved.

BERLIN -- One of the grimmest symbols of the coronavirus outbreak -- a morgue set up in a Madrid skating rink -- closed on Wednesday as stores and other businesses reopened in places across Europe, while the U.S. was beset with increasingly partisan disagreements over how and when to restart its economy.
   
 As some governors in the U.S. -- largely Republican ones -- moved to reopen an ever-wider variety of businesses, others took a more cautious approach and came under mounting pressure from protesters complaining that their livelihoods are being destroyed and their freedom of movement is being infringed on.
   
 With the crisis easing but far from over in Europe, small shops in Berlin reopened, and restrictions were also relaxed in Denmark and Austria. In France, long lines formed outside the few McDonald's drive-thrus that started serving customers again.
   
 Still, many employees and customers were uneasy, suggesting that a return to normal is a long way off.
   
 "Of course I'm happy that I can open again and we can keep our heads above water," said Galina Hooge, who opened her small Berlin toy store for the first time in over a month. But she worried that some Germans still aren't taking the outbreak seriously.
   
 "Relaxing the rules doesn't mean that everything is over. It's not over by a long stretch," she said.
   
 Across the Atlantic in Savannah, Georgia, where Gov. Brian Kemp announced that gyms and salons can reopen this week, gym owner Mark Lebos said it would be professional negligence to do so right now.
   
 "We are not going to be a vector of death and suffering," he said.
   
 The outbreak has infected over 2.5 million people and killed about 180,000 around the world, including more than 45,000 in the U.S., according to a tally compiled by Johns Hopkins University from official government figures, though the true numbers are believed to be far higher.
   
 Although some hot spots like Italy, Spain and New York have seen a drop in daily death tolls and new hospitalizations, other areas are facing a resurgence of the coronavirus.
   
 Singapore, once a model of virus tracking and prevention, saw an explosion of new cases and announced it would extend its lockdown into June.
   
 In California, health officials said two people with coronavirus died in the state weeks before the first reported U.S. death from the disease on Feb. 29 in Washington state. The finding shows that COVID-19 had been circulating in the U.S. earlier than was previously thought.
   
 The economic fallout from the crisis mounted as oil prices suffered an epic collapse and U.S. stocks registered their worst loss in weeks Tuesday on Wall Street. The U.S. Senate approved nearly $500 billion in coronavirus aid for businesses, hospitals and testing. The bill goes next to the House.
   
 In North Carolina, where Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper is keeping in place his stay-home order for at least another week, hundreds marched around the executive mansion on Tuesday. At the Missouri Capitol, several hundred with the same demands waved the American flag and chanted "USA! USA!"
   
 And in Wisconsin, GOP legislative leaders asked the state Supreme Court to block an extension of the Democratic governor's stay-home order.
   
 Spain, one of the world's worst-hit countries, planned to allow children out of their homes next week for the first time in nearly six weeks.
   
 "I am aware of the tremendous effort that the confinement has demanded of our smallest ones and their families," Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said.
   
 The country's death toll reached nearly 22,000, behind only the United States and Italy, after 435 more deaths were reported Wednesday. But the numbers reflected a plateauing of the outbreak.
   
 In another hopeful sign, a large makeshift morgue at an ice rink closed.
   
 India partially eased one of the world's strictest lockdowns this week, but health officials fear a surge in cases. Starting in May, the country is planning to use wristbands fitted with an app to track people's movements and body temperature.
   
 The technology is aimed at easing the vast manpower needed to track the virus among the country's 1.3 billion people.

Africa has registered a 43 percent jump in reported COVID-19 cases in the last week, highlighting a warning from the World Health Organization that the continent of 1.3 billion could become the next epicenter of the global outbreak.
 Africa also has a “very, very limited” and “very, very strained” testing capacity, John Nkengasong, director of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in his weekly briefing on Thursday.
 It means that the surge in infections on the continent is likely to be even higher in reality, he said.
 WHO’s recent report painted a grim picture for Africa. It warned the virus could kill more than 300,000 people and push 30 million into desperate poverty.
 Africa still has time to avert such a disaster, but testing people and tracing virus cases is critical, said Nkengasong.
 “It all depends on what we are discussing here,” Nkengasong said, “which is, are you testing? Are you finding the cases? Are you isolating and tracking the contacts? It is not a prediction that means it must happen.”
 By Nkengasong’s own criteria, Africa is struggling on the testing front.

WASHINGTON (AP) — More than 4.4 million laid-off workers applied for U.S. unemployment benefits last week as job cuts escalated across an economy that remains all but shut down, the government said Thursday.Roughly 26 million people have now filed for jobless aid in the five weeks since the coronavirus outbreak began forcing millions of employers to close their doors. About one in six American workers have now lost their jobs since mid-March, by far the worst string of layoffs on record. Economists have forecast that the unemployment rate for April could go as high as 20%.The enormous magnitude of job cuts has plunged the U.S. economy into the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Some economists say the nation's output could shrink by twice the amount that it did during the Great Recession, which ended in 2009.The painful economic consequences of the virus-related shutdowns have sparked angry protests in several state capitals from crowds demanding that businesses reopen. Some governors have begun easing restrictions despite warnings from health authorities that it may be too soon to do so without sparking new infections. In Georgia, gyms, hair salons and bowling alleys can reopen Friday. Texas has reopened its state parks.Yet those scattered re-openings won't lead to much rehiring, especially if Americans are too wary to leave their homes. Most people say they favor stay-at-home orders and believe it won't be safe to lift social distancing guidelines anytime soon. And there are likely more layoffs to come from many small businesses that have tried but failed to receive loans from a federal aid program.The total number of people who are receiving unemployment benefits has reached a record 16 million, surpassing a previous high of 12 million set in 2010, just after the 2008-2009 recession ended. This figure reflects people who have managed to navigate the online or telephone application systems in their states, have been approved for benefits and are actually receiving checks.In some states, many laid-off workers have run into obstacles in trying to file applications for benefits. Among them are millions of freelancers, contractors, gig workers and self-employed people — a category of workers who are now eligible for unemployment benefits for the first time."This has been a really devastating shock for a lot of families and small businesses," said Aaron Sojourner, a labor economist at the University of Minnesota. "It is beyond their control and no fault of their own."Just about every major industry has absorbed sudden and severe layoffs. Economists at the Federal Reserve estimate that hotels and restaurants have shed the most jobs -- 4 million since Feb. 15. That is nearly one-third of all the employees in that industry.Construction has shed more than 9% of its jobs. So has a category that includes retail, shipping and utilities, the Fed estimated. A category that is made up of data processing and online publishing has cut 4.7.When the government issues the April jobs report on May 8, economists expect it to show breathtaking losses. Economists at JPMorgan are predicting a loss of 25 million jobs. That would be nearly triple the total lost during the entire Great Recession period.A $2 trillion-plus federal relief package that was signed into law last month made millions of gig workers, contractors and self- employed people newly eligible for unemployment aid. But most states have yet to approve unemployment applications from those workers because they're still trying to reprogram their systems to do so. As a result, many people who have lost jobs aren't being counted as laid-off because their applications for unemployment aid are still pending.Among them is Sasha McVeigh, a musician in Nashville. Having grown up in England with a love of country music, she spent years flying to Nashville to play gigs until she managed to secure a green card and move permanently two years ago. McVeigh had been working steadily until the city shut down music clubs in mid-March.Since then, she's applied for unemployment benefits but so far has received nothing. To make ends meet, she's applied for some grants available to out-of-work musicians, held some live streaming concerts and pushed her merchandise sales.By cutting expenses to a bare minimum, McVeigh said, “I’ve managed to just about keep myself afloat.” But she worries about what will happen over the next few months.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

The chief executive of the Tokyo Olympics promised "transparency" with the Japanese public on Thursday regarding the cost of postponing the games until next year. Neither the Japanese organizers nor the International Olympic Committee has said what it will cost to delay the Tokyo Games for one year. Early estimates in Japan range between $2 billion and $6 billion. "It's highly likely that the expense will be higher than the originally planned budget," CEO Toshiro Muto said, speaking through an interpreter at a weekly teleconference.
 He said the exact amount was unclear, "but we will proceed with transparency and explain to the taxpayers about the costs." Although officials say the added costs are unknown, one thing is certain: Japanese taxpayers will pick up most of the bills. The Tokyo city government, the local organizers and the Japanese Olympic Committee are obligated under the "Host City Contract" signed in 2013 to cover most of the costs.
 The cost issue is sensitive in Japan, particularly for the government of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who has been a fervent backer of the Olympics. Japan, like many countries, could be deep in a recession next year, brought on the by the coronavirus pandemic. Japan is officially spending $12.6 billion to organize the Olympics, but a government audit report last year said it was at least twice that much.
 It's all public money except for $5.6 billion in a privately funded operating budget. The Switzerland-based IOC has contributed $1.3 billion to that private budget, but is not expected to pay much more. It's income over the latest four-year Olympic cycle was $5.7 billion.
 IOC member John Coates, who oversees planning for the Tokyo Olympics, said last week the IOC would need to pay "several hundred million dollars" to keep many international sports federations and national Olympic committees afloat. He did not indicate any of that money was going to Tokyo.
 Muto was asked point-blank if Japan was "prepared to pay all of the extra running costs -- or should it be shared?" He did not answer directly, referring instead to a nondescript statement put out last week by the IOC and local organizers.
 "The joint statement is all we have," Muto said. "We need to assess the impact of the postponement, and then we need to discuss how to address it."
 Muto was asked repeatedly if the pandemic would allow the delayed Olympics to open on July 23, 2021. Earlier this week, a Japanese scientist and an expert in infectious disease said it was unlikely the Olympics could be held.
 "How this coronavirus infection situation will develop and when this will end -- nobody can answer this question for sure," Muto said.
 He said postponing until July 2021 gave organizers and the IOC "enough time." He also discounted any chance of postponing until 2022. The Beijing Winter Olympics are scheduled for 2022 but are also under a cloud since it was in China where the virus was first discovered.
 "Prime Minster Abe said the nature of the Olympics would change if Tokyo 2020 were postponed for two years," Muto said.

(AP) - The latest Nation’s Report Card gives eighth-grade students unsatisfactory marks in U.S. history, geography and civics.The assessments, given for the first time digitally on tablets instead of paper, were administered from January to March 2018. History and geography scores on the assessments were lower than in the last round of tests in 2014 and civics scores didn't move, according to results of the National Assessment of Educational Progress released Thursday.Also troubling, administrators said, was that lower-performing students lost more ground than middle- and higher- performing students, mirroring a pattern seen in recent reading and math scores. The problem is likely to be made worse by the loss of class time caused by the coronavirus, which is expected to have a greater impact on lower-performing students.The pattern "should motivate us all to address the factors behind these declines for struggling students," said Lesley Muldoon, executive director of the National Assessment Governing Board, which sets policy for NAEP.Across all three subjects, a quarter or less of students scored at or above proficient, meaning they showed a solid understanding of challenging concepts. Another quarter or more failed to demonstrate a level of basic understanding, the results showed. The score gaps between white students and their black and Hispanic peers didn't significantly change."Our nation is experiencing a teachable moment with the current health crisis in terms of how important it is to understand historical forces, the role of our civic institutions, and the impact of geographical conditions of our interconnected world," said Peggy Carr, associate commissioner at the National Center for Education Statistics. "The results provided here indicate that many students are struggling to understand and explain the importance of civic participation, how American government functions, the historical significance of events, and the need to grasp and apply core geographic concepts."The tests were administered to a total of 42,700 eighth-grade students in 780 public and private schools across the nation.The average U.S. history score was 263 out of 500 in 2018, four points lower than in 2014. The results categorized 15% of eighth-graders as proficient when asked, for example, to explain the significance of certain documents and ideas in American history. History scores declined across the board for white, black and Hispanic students, the results showed.The average geography score was 258 on a 500-point scale, three points lower than in 2014, with scores for white and black students showing declines. In 2018, 25% of students scored at or above the proficient level. The 2018 civics score measuring students' knowledge of government was unchanged between 2014 and 2018. About 24% of students scored at or above proficient, and there was no significant change across ethnic groups.There has been improvement over time since the assessments were first administered in the 1990s. Civics and history scores have gone up overall and the score gap between white and Hispanic students in civics has narrowed by 10 points. Score differences also have narrowed between white students and black and Hispanic students in geography, but the gaps in history scores have remained about the same.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

BATON ROUGE, Louisiana -- Governors in 17 states have committed to regional coordination to reopen their economies during the coronavirus outbreak -- but none are in the South, where leaders are going it alone, just as they did in imposing restrictions.
   
 As questions about when and how to ease virus-control measures becomes increasingly politically charged, governors in the Deep South have resisted any appearance of synchronization, instead driving home their message that each state must make its own decision.
   
 Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp plans to have many of his state's businesses up and running again as soon as Friday. Fellow Republican Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee announced that most businesses will begin resuming operations as soon as next week.
   
 Some other Republican leaders were taking smaller steps, like reopening their beaches. In the virus hot spot of Louisiana, Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards was also taking a more cautious approach, announcing he'll first allow some non-emergency medical procedures to resume next week.
   
 But no one wants to coordinate. Edwards, for one, notes neighboring states have less expansive outbreaks. Even when several Republican governors held phone calls to talk about reopening plans, they insisted they weren't working in concert -- and left out their Democratic counterparts in the region.
   
 "We're trying to take, where we can, our destiny into our own hands," said Kemp.
   
 He's been one of the region's most aggressive so far, allowing gyms, bowling alleys, tattoo parlors and other businesses to reopen Friday, if owners follow social-distancing and hygiene requirements. Restaurants can bring back dine-in service and movie theaters can reopen by Monday.
   
 Such moves runs counter to the advice of many experts and have left many businesses wary.
   
 The lack of regional coordination also raises concerns that a loosening in one state -- especially with insufficient testing -- could lead to a spike in cases in another. But agreement would be difficult in a region with such disparate approaches.
   
 The strategy stands in stark contrast to coordination elsewhere. California, Oregon and Washington have agreed to synchronize how they will begin lifting their shelter-in-place restrictions. Seven states in the Northeast have done the same as have seven governors in the Midwest. In the latter two regions, governors from both parties are involved.
   
 In the South, it's ad hoc: Kemp said he's talked to other Southern governors, but he didn't coordinate with any of them, even though urban areas in Georgia lap over borders with several. Edwards and Republican Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves have also had conversations because of the travel and business shared between New Orleans and the Mississippi Gulf Coast. But Edwards said he did not believe further coordination was necessary.
   
 "I think if you look at those areas where this is happening, you have very similar situations in terms of the amount of COVID that they have in those various states and they have a much greater degree of inter-connectedness in terms of their economies," he said.
   
 Beyond easing the medical restrictions, Edwards says he's waiting to see if Louisiana's improving trajectory -- fewer hospitalizations, fewer people on ventilators -- remains on course, before deciding what steps he'll take when his stay-at-home order expires April 30. Louisiana still has more cases and far more deaths than any other state in the region.
   
 For most people, the highly contagious coronavirus causes symptoms such as high fever and a dry cough. But some people, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, become much sicker and even die.
   
 Elsewhere in the South, decision-making is varied.
   
 Even as neighboring Georgia pushed to reopen, Republican Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey decided to keep a stay-home order in place through the end of the month. Meanwhile, Arkansas' Republican governor, Asa Hutchinson, never issued such a mandate, though he's imposed other restrictions.
   
 Reeves in Mississippi and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, meanwhile, have allowed beaches to reopen. Reeves also has said that nonessential businesses can start offering curbside pickup or delivery.
   
 In South Carolina, barricades came off public boat ramps Friday. Closed retailers, like department stores and specialty shops, were next, but only, Republican Gov. Henry McMaster insisted, if strict social distancing was followed. He let local governments decide whether to reopen beaches. Most declined, for now.
   
 Still, it wasn't clear if the state's COVID-19 cases had peaked yet, since state health data shows the number of coronavirus tests have fallen. Georgia, too, is seeing a testing decline.
   
 Experts say that's the opposite of what's needed as restrictions ease. The leader of South Carolina's teaching hospital warned the state also needed robust tracing of the people who have had contact with the sick.
   
 "We need to have in place the pieces to keep a second wave from becoming crippling," said Dr. David Cole, president of the Medical University of South Carolina.
   
 The outbreak has hit different parts of the country in different ways -- and the response has been just as varied -- so there isn't one playbook, said Dr. Richard Oberhelman, an infectious disease specialist at Tulane University's School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine in New Orleans.
   
 "Coordination makes sense, but the flip side is different states are in different parts of the epidemic," Oberhelman said, adding that communication remained key.
   
 Some fear that if Southern states get too far out ahead of the rest of the country, they could attract visitors -- and possibly open the door to more infections.
   
 Myrtle Beach has suffered, but if it starts to ease restrictions on hotels and short-term rentals, it could see an influx of visitors looking for warm weather far from hot spots. Without extensive testing, that could spell disaster, infectious control nurse Debbie Borst told a meeting of the Myrtle Beach City Council.
   
 "The public hears one thing, but they don't realize we don't have testing available like other cities and states, so I'm worried that they have a false sense of security concerning our numbers," Borst said.
