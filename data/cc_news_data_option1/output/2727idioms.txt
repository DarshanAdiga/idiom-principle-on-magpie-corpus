According to their recommendations – made together with UNICEF – children should start breastfeeding within an hour of being born and be exclusively nursed for six months, going on to be breastfed on demand then, from six months onwards, should begin eating safe and adequate foods, while continuing to take their mum’s milk.
 Buoyed by her findings, Natasha became an advocate for natural stage weaning, saying: “There’s a saying in the community – ‘Don’t offer and don’t refuse.’
 “Putting that into practice with my girls meant that, while I wasn’t sitting them down like clockwork, offering them my milk, I wasn’t saying no if they asked.”
 Breastfeeding Ellie with no set deadline in mind of when to stop, when Grace arrived two years later, she nursed them – one at each breast – together.
 “I tandem fed for two years,” she said. “I was a little apprehensive at first about the practicalities of it all, but you find your own groove, and it gets easier the more you do it.

Credit where credit is due. The Scottish Government did succeed in protecting Scotland’s NHS during the first months of the pandemic, but at a real cost in the lives of the vulnerable residents of care homes. It is to this SNP Governments’ shame that 46% of all Covid-19 deaths occurred in a care home. It is easy to get lost in statistics and forget the real grief and loss in every case. The connections between the NHS and social care must be improved. We need to give social care staff the same levels of respect, training and remuneration as their NHS colleagues. That is all within our grasp while using the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament.

The World Zionist Organization (WZO) is devising a plan to bring to Israel the Jewish community of France.
 Deputy CEO of WZO, Yaakov Hagoel, handed a letter to Israel's Immigration and Absorption Minister, Pnina Tamano-Shata, detailing his plan to bring French Jews to Israel.
 Hagoel explains his reasoning behind the plan by explaining that he believes that French Jews are likely to leave France and move to other places across the world, and that Israel should make its best effort to bring them here. He further explained that the French Jewish community holds Zionism very closely and tends to bring financial benefits to Israel in various ways.
 "The situation in France is deteriorating every day," Hagoel said. "Between the worsening economic situation and rising antisemitism, and France is giving in to extreme Islamic Jihad."
 The plan spoke about the opportunity to quickly and efficiently bring about 50,000 members of the community, as well as another half a million over the next few years, citing the economic benefit they can bring to Israel, as well as citing Zionist and Jewish traditions as reasons to try and bring them to Israel.
 Hagoel suggested removing the various bureaucratic processes which can complicate the process of aliyah in order to maximize the country's ability to bring those people to Israel.
 "First of all, we need to have a list of businesses willing to employ the _olim_ in exchange for tax benefits or government subsidizing, putting the system in place in France first so as to allow new arrivals the ability to adjust to their new lives as quickly as possible."
 According to his statement, these steps are necessary as to bring back the number of new French olim, which has been in decline since 2015, due to the various difficulties the plan wishes to remedy.
 "All government ministries must mobilize for the issue and bring the Jews of France to Israel," Hagoel said, "This is our Zionism today."
 The coronavirus pandemic has caused a number of antisemitic conspiracy theories to take hold in a number of countries, France among them, claiming Jews either creating the disease or were profiting from it.
 One example is as a French caricature of the former minister of health Agnes Buzyn (portrayed with a large nose signifying she is Jewish) smiling as she pours poison into a well.

It’s been four years since Arsenal finished above their rivals in the league, with the balance of power in north London having undeniably shifted slightly towards Spurs in recent seasons.
 But should Arteta’s side beat their neighbours this weekend, they will move four points ahead of them in the table with just three games remaining. It would also put them firmly in the driving seat for a Europa League place.
 Arsenal have a real opportunity to lay down a marker against their rivals on Sunday. Victory would be another sign that the club chose wisely when turning to the young Spaniard in November, while defeat for Tottenham would only increase the belief held by many that Mourinho’s best years are firmly behind him.

The young English attacker has quickly worked his way into Mikel Arteta's plans and earned himself a unique nickname in the process.
 Arsenal's captain giving Saka the label of "Little Chilli" in a nod to the youngster's high-energy displays.
 "I call him this [Little Chilli] but in French so it is 'Petit Piment'," Aubameyang told _Sky Sports_. "It’s because he is like a little chilli, so much energy, so much power and is quite small so it’s funny."
 Despite the funny nickname, Aubameyang is very serious about just how good Saka can become in the years to come, noting that he's got the ideal mentality to be a success.
 "Oh for sure, he is one of the best, for sure. What I like about him is he is always listening to advice from us the experienced players," Aubameyang said.
 "I really like it and he is really humble, he always wants to go forwards and learn more and try to improve his game so definitely he is one of the best.
 "Of course, I think he’s 18 so he has a lot of time, but as I said to him the most important thing is to enjoy, because at this age to be at this club is really special and he just has to continue like this, to keep improving and I am sure he will go straight to the top."
 Arteta, meanwhile, wants Saka to enjoy his breakout season, warning football is a mix of good and bad moments.

“Mikel is amazing,” said Saka. "He manages to give so much detail while at the same time being so clear. It's just amazing to have such a great coach. The future looks bright and that's why I'm happy to be here.”
 Saka is just one of several youngsters now making their mark on the first- team. Academy products Ainsley Maitland-Niles, Joe Willock, Eddie Nketiah and Reiss Nelson are regulars – then there is Gabriel Martinelli, who has been a revelation since arriving as a 17-year-old from Brazil last summer.
 Kieran Tierney, now finally injury free, is showing why Arsenal were so determined to sign him from Celtic last summer and William Saliba will arrive soon, having been immediately loaned back to Saint Etienne after agreeing to move to the Emirates last summer.
 There is a youthful energy around Arsenal nowadays that has been harnessed by Arteta. There is still plenty of room for improvement, of course, and Pierre- Emerick Aubameyang leaving at the end of the season would be a major blow, but there is still a sense of optimism at the club now about what the future may hold.
 Conversely, a few miles down the road things seem to have gone a bit stale. Spurs may have reached the Champions League final just 12 months ago, but now they are facing up to their first season outside of Europe’s elite competition since the 2015-16 campaign.
 They have an ageing squad and very little money to reshape it, with the club having had to take a £175m ($198m) loan from the Bank of England to aid them during the coronavirus crisis. And for all that Mourinho has achieved since he arrived in England, he has not shown he can rebuild a squad on a limited budget.

The company has been at the center of tensions between China and Britain, as U.K. officials review how the latest U.S. sanctions — imposed over allegations of cyber spying and aimed at cutting off Huawei's access to advanced microchips made with American technology — will affect British telecom networks.
 Johnson decided in January that Huawei can be deployed in future 5G networks as long as its share of the market is limited, but officials have since hinted that that decision could be reversed in light of the U.S. sanctions. A new policy is expected within weeks.
 Huawei says it is merely caught in the middle of a U.S.-China battle over trade and technology. It has consistently denied allegations it could carry out cyber espionage or electronic sabotage at the behest of the Chinese Communist Party.
 “We’ve definitely been pushed into the geopolitical competition,” Vice President Victor Zhang said Wednesday. U.S. accusations about security risks are all politically motivated, he said.
 Nigel Inkster, senior adviser to the International Institute for Strategic Studies and former director of operations and intelligence at Britain’s MI6 intelligence service, said the issue with Huawei was not so much about immediate security threats. Rather, he said, the deeper worry lies in the geopolitical implications of China becoming the world's dominant player in 5G technology.
 “It’s less about cyber espionage than generally conceived because, after all, that’s happening in any place,” he said. “This was never something of which the U.K. was lacking awareness.”

However, denials swiftly emerged from the Emirates, with the club keen to distance themselves from any links to a man who clashed so many times with former manager Arsene Wenger.
 “We’d be selling our soul,” one source said. “Raul has not seen Jose in person for years,” another made clear.
 The mere suggestion of Mourinho taking over at Arsenal was enough to stir up a hornet's nest of emotions amongst fans.
 There were some who welcomed the link to a manager who was viewed as a ‘winner’, but others were appalled by the idea, given Mourinho’s past, his style of play and of course his countless ugly run-ins with Wenger.
 It was a conversation that quickly died down, however, as within three weeks, Mourinho had pitched up at the other end of the Seven Sisters Road in north London, replacing Mauricio Pochettino at Tottenham.
 Arsenal, meanwhile, turned to their former captain, bringing Mikel Arteta back to the club to take over from Emery, who was sacked nine days after Spurs had unveiled Mourinho.
 Two clubs, just four miles apart, had gone down very different routes in an attempt to revive themselves just six months after both had been beaten in European finals.
 For Arsenal, it was a step into the unknown. Arteta, a young head coach who had been schooled under the best in the business, Pep Guardiola, was tasked with rebuilding a club that had lost its way following the departure of Wenger two years earlier.
 But down the road at Tottenham it was a different story. Daniel Levy had opted for the tried-and-tested option.
 Whereas Arsenal had made an appointment with an eye on the future, Spurs had arguably turned to a man relying on past glories to achieve short-term success, whether that be trophies or staying in the top four.

As is the case with every human endeavor, the raising of a child is, never has been, and never will be done perfectly. Furthermore, every human being comes into the world bearing unique traits. Lessons from one’s own childhood as well as prior childrearing experience can be of assistance, but in the final analysis, one learns to be a proper parent to Billy or Susie by raising Billy or Susie. There are general commonsense principles, but there is no one-size- fits-all formula.
 Parenting is, in other words, a trial-and-error process. Everyone who attempts it, therefore, will commit error. The question becomes: Did the errors made by a certain parent or set of parents determine the trajectory of their child’s life from beginning to end?
 The notion that parenting is deterministic was proposed by Sigmund Freud (1856-1939), the so-called “Father of Modern Psychology.” It is because of Freud’s proposition that most therapists attempt to link an individual’s “issues” to features of his or her childhood. Supposedly, the fact that a person’s father was an alcoholic and abandoned the family explains said person’s chronic codependency, for example.

 While Ellie stopped wanting to breastfeed just before she turned five, Grace continues to suckle once in the morning and once in the evening. But Natasha still deals with negativity, which she blames on people’s miseducation, rather than on deliberate nastiness.
 “People see breastfeeding as fair game – something everyone is allowed to have an opinion on and criticise,” she said. “I never would, as it is every mum’s choice, but I know if I said something about bottle feeding, it would be unacceptable.
 “I have received some difficult comments over the years. When Grace was just eight months old, I had somebody say to me that I should be force-feeding her into weaning by that point. I just thought, ‘What would you say if you knew I’m also feeding her older sister?’”
 “I also get lots of people remarking that I’m ‘still’ feeding – with emphasis on the still,” she continued.
