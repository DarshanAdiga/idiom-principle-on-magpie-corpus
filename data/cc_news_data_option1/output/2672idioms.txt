INDIANAPOLIS — A recent study by the Indiana Public Defender Commission has found that lawyers doing public defense work make less than $6 per hour, after accounting for the expenses of doing the public defense work.
 Torrin Liddell, research and statistics analyst for the Indiana Public Defender Commission, conducted the statewide survey over the past year to investigate the costs required to support an attorney practicing public defense. The costs, known as overhead costs, include the attorney’s benefits, costs of maintaining an office and pay and benefits for non-attorney employees, which was the biggest overhead cost reported in the survey.
 Liddell said the commission looked into the issue after multiple attorneys told them that they were having to pay a lot of costs out of pocket. Some reported the costs were so expensive they weren’t bringing home enough money to live off of after getting paid for the contract.

"All the batsmen batted quite well especially Babar Azam, Asad Shafiq and Abid Ali seemed in total control, Shan Masood adapted well to the conditions and Mohammad Rizwan looked in good shape," he added.The team returned to training on June 30 after a gap of more than three months and captain Azhar Ali believes that experienced pacer Mohammad Abbas will guide and share his knowledge with young seamers."Mohammad Abbas is our experienced bowler and his presence is of advantage for us as he also keeps guiding the youngsters. He is someone who can be a very important member of the attack for us. Naseem Shah bowled very well in the scenario-based match. He will attain more control as he continues to bowl," Azhar said.The skipper admitted that it will be a challenge to play cricket at "full-strength" after the coronavirus enforced break but playing practice matches will serve the purpose."We are playing cricket after a long time and it is not going to be easy to start at full- strength. We have to go step-by-step and I am very happy that the boys utilised their practice time of four days well," Azhar said."No matter how much you practice, playing matches is always more beneficial. If you spend half of your practice's time in scenario-based matches, it gives you a lot more confidence. Playing this scenario-based match was very important for us," he added.To prevent the proliferation of COVID-19, the International Cricket Council (ICC) has introduced changes in its playing conditions that prohibit bowlers from shining the ball with saliva and handing their sweater, cap or hat to the umpires while bowling.Azhar said that adjusting to the new regulations was a little difficult, but the practice games will help in the adaptation."There are some areas where we have to adapt. In this weather, it was only the fast bowlers who sweated so it was a challenge for us to shine the ball. But, that's something which will change as the weather continues to get warm," he said."The most challenging thing, however, was that the bowlers had to put their sweaters and caps outside the boundary rope because of which managing the over rate was getting a bit difficult. Especially, in Yasir Shah's case, he fields in the circle but had to go all the way to the boundary to put his things. But, I am comfortable that we will adapt to these changes as we still have a two-day and two four-day matches to play and they will help us," Azhar added.The first match will be played at Old Trafford, Manchester on August 5. Pakistan is currently under a 14-day quarantine period, following which they will travel to Derbyshire on July 13",

At Ohio State, Drake also worked to lower the cost of attendance and increase financial aid — issues that loom large for UC students. He introduced a financial model that raises costs for tuition, mandatory fees, housing and dining once for incoming freshmen, then locks them in for four years. Under his tenure, Ohio State boosted financial aid to low- and moderate-income Ohioans by more than $200 million since 2015, twice his initial target, and increased grants and scholarships.
 He is also credited with helping Ohio State hit record highs in applications, graduation rates and sponsored research awards. Last year, he announced a $4.5-billion fundraising campaign, the largest goal in the school’s history.
 While some faculty at both Ohio State and UC Irvine said he was not the most visible or hands-on academic leader, he was popular with students. Alexis Gomes, an incoming fifth-year Ohio State student in neuroscience, said students appreciated his initiatives to cut fees, lower textbook costs and provide all students with an iPad, Apple pencil and a notetaking app.
 Drake steps into the top UC job at a time of financial distress. The COVID-19 pandemic has cost the university system $1.2 billion in increased costs and lost revenues from March to the end of April, and faces potential state budget cuts. At the same time, UC regents have pulled a proposal for now to raise tuition in light of pandemic-caused economic distress.

Eisenhower was personally sympathetic to a test ban. In fact, in 1958, he and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev agreed to a voluntary two-way moratorium just four days after Khrushchev came to power. The advent and improvement of underground testing methods had by then relieved some of the pressure to test above ground or in the atmosphere. The main question was whether underground tests could convey the same military-scientific advantages as above-ground ones. After President John F. Kennedy entered office and Moscow and Washington drifted further apart over the 1961 Berlin Crisis, the Soviet Union suddenly abandoned the moratorium and resumed testing, sparking fears that American reluctance to test too would lead to qualitative inferiority.

“I think it was just (an injury) from over the years,” Patterson said. “What I had was a cartilage defect in my left knee, so the cartilage just kind of wore down over time. It doesn’t happen on the spur of the moment, like an ACL or MCL where it just pops. It just wears away over time is how the doctor explained it, so it causes your knee to really swell up. Once that happens, any time you go to run or jump, it becomes like a balloon, so I had to go get that fixed.”
 That fix meant that not only did Patterson have to sit out her transfer season, she also spent a lot of time in rehab, making the integration process just a little more challenging.
 “It’s hard. You really have to come in every day with a positive mindset — that’s the most important thing,” Patterson said. “What the coaches and my other teammates have always told me when they’ve gone through injuries is you have to take one day at a time.
 “You’re looking at the long run — that’s where you want to get to — but I had to come in and try to get the little victories. If that meant lifting my leg, getting a 90-degree bend, whatever that meant for that day, I just had to try and go in and do it. Yeah, it was isolating, because I spent a lot of time in rehab when my teammates were on the court, but I knew it was something I had to do and I couldn’t have done it with better teammates and coaches, because they were always right there with me.”
 But two years at Notre Dame, playing under veterans on a team that won the 2018 national championship and finished as the 2019 national runner-up, prepared Patterson to do more than put up shots and do ballhandling drills during practices.
 “Above anything else, I learned how to be a better teammate,” she said. “We had six freshmen last year, so being on the sideline you don’t want to just stand there and not say anything, plus I had two years of experience previously at Notre Dame. I figured out ways to help them and encourage them, because I know how hard freshman year can be, how hard sophomore year can be.
 “… I know a lot of times when people mess up on the court, you have to approach each person differently. I think you learn that being around your teammates. Some people react to screaming and yelling and all that stuff, some people need you to pull them to the side and say, ‘Hey, you can do better.’ That comes with learning your teammates. I think I took that from Notre Dame, and I would want someone to do the same for me if I was in that position, telling me I’m not doing great or telling me what I can do better.”
 That approach is one reason why Patterson seems poised to help fill the leadership shoes of lone graduating senior Brenna Wise.
 “I do seeing Dani Patterson as being one of those kids who could slip into the role of being a leader,” IU coach Teri Moren told The Herald-Times this spring. “She had a great temperament and a great pulse on our team as individuals. Just watching her in practice, watching her walk around and talk and communicate with teammates was very special. She stayed very engaged.”
 Patterson also has an impressive basketball resume to draw on as top-30 player and McDonald’s All-American coming out of high school in 2017 before heading to one of the nation’s elite programs in South Bend.
 Growing up, however, basketball didn’t initially take root, even with her parents as coaches for a Catholic Youth Organization (CYO) team in Queens, New York.
 “At first I didn’t like it as much, I’ll be very honest,” Patterson said. “My mom asked, ‘Do you like playing basketball?’ I was like, ‘Ehh, it’s all right.’ I tried softball and stuff, but I didn’t like that a whole lot either. I came back to basketball around fourth or fifth grade and got really serious about it and realized how much I loved it.”

In the course of ongoing research, I came across declassified executive agency documents that explain why the White House pursued the Limited Test Ban Treaty of 1963 — the precursor the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty — despite high confidence that the Soviet Union would violate it and concerns that those violations could go undetected. The documents demonstrate that Kennedy administration officials recognized that a test ban would be advantageous for the United States _even if_ the Soviet Union found a way to cheat. In particular, they concluded that a test ban could freeze technological progress by U.S. adversaries in the most important classes of weapons. This, in their view, would be worth the risk of losing ground on other technological dimensions. In light of unsubstantiated protestations that China and Russia are now flaunting the norm against nuclear testing, Cold War-era debates are relevant to certain debates today.

 Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer and Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister were spotted Tuesday in a Toronto airport lounge not wearing mandatory masks to curb COVID-19.
 Two separate photos of the bare-faced leaders sitting comfortably in a waiting area circulated online.
 Scheer's office said he was wearing a mask for his trip. A spokesperson said the photos must have been taken after he doffed the covering to take a call but before he put it back on.
 Pallister was contrite.
 "I lifted my mask to join some friends in conversation at the Toronto airport this afternoon," he said in a statement.
 "It was an error on my part, it won't happen again."
 Toronto's Pearson airport currently has a policy that masks must be worn at all times to curb the spread of COVID-19, with limited exceptions that include being at a food or beverage service location.
 The photos shows Scheer in the lounge with Pallister and a couple of others, and while they are seated spaced apart, none is wearing a mask.
 In April, Scheer was criticized for bringing his family on a government flight back to Ottawa for a House of Commons sitting, reducing the ability for the other two MPs on board to keep a distance from the Scheers.
 He and other party leaders have been wearing masks around Parliament Hill. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also wears them during photo ops.
 Scheer is in the waning days of his leadership. The ballots to select his replacement go in the mail in the coming days and a new leader will be elected in late August.
 As for Pallister, Manitoba requires most people returning to the province from Ontario, Quebec or the Atlantic provinces to self-isolate for 14 days, but provides exceptions for truckers, health providers, politicians and some others if they do not have COVID-19 symptoms.

Answers should come soon. Experts say it can take three to four weeks after exposure to the virus for infected people to become sick enough to be hospitalized, and four to five weeks after exposure for some of the most vulnerable patients to die from the disease.

Yet the number of deaths declined, with 2,128 people dying in May and 1,915 in June.   Gov. Gavin Newsom said Monday that while a higher percentage of coronavirus tests are confirming infections, “we’re not seeing a commensurate increase yet in mortality.”
 More younger people are also testing positive for the virus, a trend that has become apparent as the economy has reopened and working-age adults returned to jobs and resumed social gatherings.

By sixth grade, Patterson had her first college offer and there was no looking back for a girl that was often literally head and shoulders above the rest.
 “When we were playing with co-ed teams, I was one of the tallest kids, always the tallest girl there,” said Patterson, who grew up emulating Scottie Pippen and Candace Parker. “A lot of times (I was) taller than the boys who were playing. I never felt out of place. If anything, I felt in place. I went to school, and I was always the tallest girl. Sometimes you can feel weird about that, but you feel right where you need to be on the basketball court.”
 For all the individual and team success that followed, Patterson didn’t feel like she was where she needed to be after two years at Notre Dame. On the court she was only playing 10-12 minutes per game for the Irish, while off the court Patterson was a sports management major. A sports media class had her starting to look in a different direction academically. All of those factors played into the decision to transfer, a second time through the recruiting process, albeit in speed-dating fashion, led Patterson to Indiana.
 “I think at that point you know what you want and don’t want,” she said. “When you’re doing it for the first time, there are a lot of things you don’t know, especially if you don’t have a brother or sister or someone do it before you. I’m an only child, so that was the first time for my parents doing it, the first time I was doing it.
 “I knew what I wanted in a school the second time around. I wanted a place that really cheered you on, where everyone had a common goal, that you had a very family atmosphere with teammates and coaches and someplace you go in every day and have an opportunity to get better, you have the opportunity to work with people who are going to get you where you need to be.”
 Patterson, who did some podcast work at Notre Dame, jumped at the chance to become a sports media major while minoring in management at IU, starting by hosting introductory interviews with the freshmen on social media last fall.
 Looking back, the affable Patterson now sees a moment in fourth grade that foreshadowed her future, one she was reminded of by her mother recently.
 “In fourth grade, I had won a speech contest with one of my other classmates, and we had to recite a poem or something, read a letter, and we got an award for it,” Patterson said, “so I knew I kind of had a gift when it came to speaking and asking people questions and connecting with people that way.
 “I had never really thought about it, but the more I thought about it and started to do it, you know you get to hold the mic and sit in front of the camera and all that in classes here, and I thought, ‘This is something I really think I can excel in and I enjoy doing it.’ I enjoy talking to people and hearing people’s stories, whether that’s athletes or just regular people. I get a lot of joy from it, so it’s something I switched to last minute, but I think I made the right choice.”
 Patterson has been one of the most vocal Hoosiers since the 2019-20 season ended, including videos with teammates discussing the recent racism issues and last month starting what she hopes will be a monthly podcast called Social at a Distance. The first guest was former IU standout Jori Davis.
 “It’s a conscious effort (to speak out), and I do think we have a responsibility being student-athletes,” said Patterson, who is doing an internship at WFHB. “We’re kind of put in a place at the forefront and we have a huge platform, from our fans to little girls and little boys always looking up to us. I think we have a responsibility to teach them right from wrong and when it comes to race issues and things like that, how important it is to love who you are and understand how important it is to respect others.”
 That opportunity was driven home by the team meet-and-greets after games at Simon Skjodt Assembly Hall.
 “It’s so awesome. When (the kids) come to the games afterward, they’re like sponges,” she said. “They’re looking at everything we’re doing, and that’s why it is so important to watch what we’re posting and what we’re saying to them, because if you look at it, we were in the position years ago, looking for someone to look up to, so if we can give them a positive image to say, ‘This is what I can grow up and be, a strong woman whether black, white, in between, whatever.’ We have that opportunity and can’t let it go to waste, because they are looking up to us.”
 That gives Patterson some pretty good footing for her IU career, on and off the court.

Dear Martha and family and friends, What an influence this man had on my life. I often hear him when I choose words and structure my thoughts to write a letter or response, more so these days it seems (maybe it's his doing that my Facebook posts are always so long ). He was one of the male role models that helped me be who I am.      I had no idea he was up north until I ran into him in Traverse City probably 10 or 15 years ago. He was rehearsing for a Benzie County Chorus concert in a basement room at the Park Place and my quartet was performing in the Dome. We both rounded a corner and came face to face. I said, "Mr Molema?" And he said, "Oh God. Call me Andy!" and hugged me. We bumped into each other a few times after that. On one such occasion, when I was with my wife, I indroduced him, "THIS... is Uncle Wally."

Dutch police said last week that their investigations, code-named 26Lemont, based on millions of messages from the EncroChat phones, had led to the arrest of more than 100 suspects and seizure of more than 8,000 kilograms (17,600 pounds) of cocaine and 1,200 kilograms (2,600 pounds) of crystal meth as well as the dismantling of 19 synthetic drugs labs and seizure of dozens of firearms.
 On June 22, Dutch national police force officers arrested six men on suspicion of crimes including preparing kidnappings and serious assault. Detectives also discovered the seven converted sea containers in a warehouse in Wouwse Plantage, a small village in the southwestern Netherlands, close to the border with Belgium, according to a statement released Tuesday.
 They were tipped off by messages from an EncroChat phone including photos of the container and dentist’s chair with belts attached to the arm and foot supports. The messages called the warehouse the “treatment room” and the “ebi,” a reference to a top security Dutch prison. The messages also reaveled identities of potential victims, who were warned and went into hiding, police said.
 Video released by the police showed a heavily armed arrest team blasting open a door at the warehouse and discovering the improvised prison. Another armed team detained a suspect in Rotterdam.

At UC, other top issues Drake will immediately face include managing campus fall reopenings during the pandemic, rising demands to defund campus police and calls to better support Black students triggered by the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer.
 The president-elect, who will take the helm by Aug. 15, will be paid a base annual salary of $890,000 — a significant boost from Napolitano’s $570,000 but slightly less than his Ohio State salary. He agreed to a 10% pay cut through next June, as other UC leaders have done in light of pandemic-related fiscal challenges.
 Drake was born in New York City and raised in New Jersey and Sacramento as the son of a doctor and a social worker. He attended Stanford University before moving to UC San Francisco for medical school. A music fan, he plays the guitar and is an avid cyclist. He is married to Brenda Drake, an attorney, and has two sons and four grandchildren.

To build organized tissues in the lab, scientists use scaffolds to provide a surface for cells to attach based on a predetermined rigid shape. For example, an artificial kidney needs a structure, or scaffold, of a certain shape for kidney cells to grow on. Indeed, this strategy helps the tissue to organize in the early stages but creates problems in the long run, such as eventual immune reactions to these synthetic scaffolds or inaccurate structures.

In a pandemic, “there has to be a middle road, another way,” Angus said. “We do not have the luxury of time. We must try to learn while doing.”
 The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center’s 40 hospitals in Pennsylvania, New York, Maryland and Ohio joined a study underway in the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand that randomly assigns patients to one of dozens of possible treatments and uses artificial intelligence to adapt treatments, based on the results. If a drug looks like a winner, the computer assigns more people to get it. Losers are quickly abandoned.
 The system “learns on the fly, so our physicians are always betting on the winning horse,” Angus said.
 A small number of patients given usual care serve as a comparison group for all of the treatments being tested, so more participants wind up getting a shot at trying something.

Notwithstanding Foch’s apparent endorsement of the “never mind maneuvers, always go straight at ‘em” approach so dear to Patrick O’Brian’s Jack Aubrey, Foch believed that strategy boiled down to maneuver. But the maneuvering had to be for the sake of setting up the decisive attack. This was an important distinction for him, given his condescending view of pre-1789 commanders, whom he compared to fencers who maneuvered to score points rather than kill. In contrast, Napoleon maneuvered to kill. Foch believed he could teach the art of maneuvering to kill by studying not formulae for victory but rather fundamental “principles of war” that he believed should guide commanders’ analysis of how to proceed. Foch’s catchphrase was said to have been “ _De quoi s’agit-il?”_ meaning “What’s it all about?” The idea is to think and adapt rather than do anything mechanically, an imperative that gave commanders full license, for example, to abandon the disastrous tactics of 1914 and try something else.

 Peskov remarked that Russian-Czech relations were "marred by certain events with some unfriendly steps taken by regional and central authorities." In early April, a district in Prague dismantled a monument to a Soviet marshal Ivan Konev and was planning to put it in a museum. The Kremlin then said it would prefer to see the monument restored in the Czech Republic or in Russia.

Jacob said that he does not believe that the counter-protesters think that Black lives don’t matter, but that those who set up on the east side of Indiana Street were opposed to what the Black Lives Matter organization believes — and not necessarily what it says.
 Officers with the Mooresville Metropolitan Police Department, Morgan County Sheriff’s Department and Brooklyn Police Department were all present Friday evening to help keep the peace.
 While both sides shouted at each other, there was no physical violence during the event.
 Often times, as one member of an opposing protest attempted to switch sides, a police officer asked that individual to return to their respective side of the street.
 At one point, an individual blew black exhaust from their truck onto the Black Lives Matter protesters.
 That individual was quickly stopped by police officers.
 Despite the shouting between the two groups, both Maurizio and Jacob felt things went well.
 “I’m just glad that no physical altercations have happened, nothing has happened” Maurizio said. “Honestly, the Mooresville Police Department has been very objective on the matter, and I really appreciate that. They have been telling both sides to stay back.
 Jacob, too, acknowledged that things remained mostly peaceful.
 “We have had people go and shake hands and things like that, opinions being expressed,” Jacob said. “I’m really happy that nothing has been destroyed and there has really been no violence yet, that is really, really good.”
 Friday night’s protest lasted several hours, and the March on the Suburbs continued in Plainfield on Saturday and will occur in Carmel on July 12, Avon on July 13 and Fishers on July 19.

Craving better information, a University of Minnesota doctor who had been turned down for federal funding spent $5,000 of his own money to buy hydroxychloroquine for a rigorous test using placebo pills as a comparison. In early June, Dr. David Boulware’s results showed hydroxychloroquine did not prevent COVID-19 in people closely exposed to someone with it.
 A UK study found the drug ineffective for treatment, as did other studies by the U.S. National Institutes of Health and the World Health Organization.
 Boulware’s colleague, Dr. Rahda Rajasingham, aimed to enroll 3,000 health workers  in a study to see if hydroxychloroquine could prevent infection, but recently decided to stop at 1,500.
 When the study started, “there was this belief that hydroxychloroquine was this wonder drug,” Rajasingham said. More than 1,200 people signed up in just two weeks, but that slowed to a trickle after some negative reports.

Wizz Air Abu Dhabi is now operational and flying out of Abu Dhabi International Airport.
 The low-cost carrier completed its maiden flight between the UAE capital and Budapest on July 1, making the flight available twice a week.
 Flights to Bucharest will also depart twice a week, with more European connections in the pipeline.
 From September, twice-weekly flights will also be added flying to Cluj-Napoca, Katowice and Sofia.
 Flights start from AED245 per passenger.
 Wizz Air chief commercial officer George Michalopoulos said: "I am delighted to celebrate the first scheduled Wizz Air flight to Abu Dhabi. Wizz Air is committed to growing the airline’s network to the capital of the United Arab Emirates.
 "Our new sanitising protocols will give our customers the confidence that they can safely rely on Wizz Air’s ultra-low fares to visit Abu Dhabi on board one of the world’s greenest fleet. Wizz Air’s ultra-low fares and route network will contribute to the further growth of Abu Dhabi’s tourism sector."
 At the end of June, the UAE designated Wizz Air Abu Dhabi as a national carrier, joining Etihad Airways.

Liddell said these reports led the commission to conduct the study. He said the commission cares about the clients who most often encounter public defense attorneys — those who can’t choose their attorneys because they can’t pay — and wants to see them receive quality defense.
 But because the attorneys currently have to take on multiple private cases on top of their full-time jobs as public defenders just to make enough money to survive after paying all the overhead costs, Liddell said that quality defense could be at risk.
 “That’s why we’re concerned about this,” Liddell said. “This sets up an incentive structure, such that the public defense that’s being provided to these clients can’t be good enough if these people are having to work two full-time jobs just to make ends meet.”

The Silicon Valley data-mining firm Palantir Technologies confidentially filed to go public, setting up what could be the biggest stock offering from a technology company since Uber’s debut last year.
 Founded in 2004 by investors including Peter Thiel, the company works with governments, law enforcement agencies and the defense establishment to organize and analyze huge volumes of data. The technology can be used to disrupt terrorist networks or battle human trafficking. Most recently, it was used by the White House to track coronavirus infections. Last year, Palantir won army contracts potentially worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
 The company has stirred controversy for upgrading Immigration and Customs Enforcement software that has been used in the Trump administration’s deportation crackdown, which led to on-campus campaigns to discourage recruitment and the picketing of CEO Alex Karp’s home.
 The Palo Alto company has attracted venture capital from investors including In-Q-Tel, the Central Intelligence Agency’s investment arm. It has been weighing going public for years, with reluctance coming from the added scrutiny to the secretive nature of much of its business.

Next week, while close to two-thirds of the country will be warmer than normal, about 40% of the Lower 48 has a moderate risk of extreme and dangerous heat, said Climate Prediction Center meteorologist Matthew Rosencrans.
 Next week, Wisconsin could be battling it out with the Southeast for the nation’s hottest feels-like temperature — which factors in humidity — with heat indices pushing past 100, Rosencrans said. And the worst prolonged heat looks to be around western Nebraska, Oklahoma and the Texas panhandle, with temperatures approaching 110, but without the sticky humidity.
 The weather maps are covered in blood red, dark brown and purple — colors signifying much hotter than normal temperatures. Rosencrans said he’s never seen temperature forecast maps like that at the hottest time of the year.
 A giant ridge of high pressure, parking hot air, is stuck in the Southwest and extends farther east that usual, blocking cold fronts from moving in, Rosencrans said. And the jet stream, a river of air that keeps weather moving, has retreated to Canada, so nothing is pushing the heat along. On top of that, dry weather feeds the heat in a “vicious feedback cycle,” he said.

Claire Lynne Kaczmarcyk died peacefully at her home in Easthampton, Massachusetts, on June 30, 2020, after a long battle with cancer. Claire was born in Torrington, Connecticut, on August 1, 1957, to Elizabeth (Amrich) and Edward J. Kaczmarcyk, Sr. She graduated from Torrington High School and received a B.S. in Landscape Architecture and Regional Planning from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. After graduation, she relocated permanently to western Massachusetts, settling first in Northampton and then spending the last 20 years of her life as a resident of Easthampton.      Claire worked as Project Coordinator for R.M. Hursh, a retail store construction contractor, for more than 20 years. Although the business closed in 2009, owner Bob Hursh and Claire remained life-long friends. Claire later held bookkeeping and administrative positions at various small local businesses, most recently at Summit Landscaping. Detail oriented and a problem solver, Claire always looked for ways to make whatever business she worked for better.      Claire was a talented seamstress with a flair for making any outfit memorable, but she was happiest when called upon to do a simple hem or make a new pair of curtains for a family member. She was an avid reader and loved cooking and baking, eagerly sharing recipes with family and friends. She gardened and looked forward each year to the arrival of the spring seed catalogs and to her summer outings at local farmers' markets and farm stands. Claire also nurtured many houseplants, including some that were decades old.      Claire traveled whenever she had the opportunity, enjoying 30 years of holiday gatherings in New York and Connecticut with her sisters, as well as trips to Washington, California, Mexico, and the Caribbean. Her favorite memories were of trips she made to Europe--especially Paris--with her partner, Peter Davies.      Claire had an in interest in Eastern medicine and herbal remedies, learning as much as possible to augment and support her Western medical treatment. She was a regular at Tai Chi classes led by her teacher, Makani, at the Northampton Athletic Club, where she made many lasting friendships. A swimmer from an early age, Claire enjoyed her daily summertime swim at the pool of her good friend Mick. She also had a world-class penguin collection.      Calm, patient, and loyal, Claire loved her family and was a good listener, happy to hear the details of whatever was on your mind. She was always ready to take on a challenge. To get a landscaping position, she learned how to run heavy equipment, and she convinced her father to give her a job pumping gas at his service station--the first and only woman he ever hired for that position. Whatever she did, Claire preferred to work behind the scenes--helping with the gravy at Thanksgiving, volunteering at the soup kitchen, pitching in to clean- up, or checking up on an elderly neighbor.      Claire is survived by her longtime partner Peter Davies, his daughter Kate Feld, and her husband Sean Feld of Lexington, Kentucky. She will also be sorely missed by her eight siblings and their partners: Edward Kaczmarcyk, Jr., Elizabeth Kaczmarcyk and Peter Avenia, Karen Kaczmarcyk and Alex Poletsky, Janet Buckley, Thomas Alexander, Diane Kaczmarcyk and Karl Stevens, Deborah Cronin, and Jennifer and Michael Parsons. Several aunts and cousins also survive Claire.      There will be no public service at this time. The family will plan a celebration of Claire's life sometime in the future. In lieu of flowers, memorial donations in honor of Claire Kaczmarcyk may be sent to Cooley Dickinson VNA and Hospice, P.O. Box 329, Northampton MA 01061-0329.The GRAHAM FUNERAL HOME & CREMATION SERVICES, 18 Adams Street in Easthampton was honorably and proudly entrusted with Claire's cremation.

(AP) - A two-year audit of Facebook’s civil rights record found “serious setbacks” that have marred the social network’s progress on matters such as hate speech, misinformation and bias.Facebook hired the audit’s leader, former American Civil Liberties Union executive Laura Murphy, in May 2018 to assess its performance on vital social issues. Its 100-page report released Wednesday outlines a “seesaw of progress and setbacks” at the company on everything from bias in Facebook’s algorithms to its content moderation, advertising practices and treatment of voter suppression.The audit recommends that Facebook build a “civil rights infrastructure” into every aspect of the company, as well as a “stronger interpretation” of existing voter suppression policies and more concrete action on algorithmic bias. Those suggestions are not binding, and there is no formal system in place to hold Facebook accountable for any of the audit’s findings.“While the audit process has been meaningful, and has led to some significant improvements in the platform, we have also watched the company make painful decisions over the last nine months with real world consequences that are serious setbacks for civil rights,” the audit report states.Those include Facebook's decision to exempt politicians from fact-checking, even when President Donald Trump posted false information about voting by mail. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has cited a commitment to free speech as a reason for allowing such posts to remain on the platform, even though the company has rules in place against voter suppression it could have used to take down — or at least add warning labels to — Trump's posts.Last month, Facebook announced it would begin&nbsp;labeling rule-breaking posts&nbsp;— even from politicians — going forward. But it is not clear if Trump's previous controversial posts would have gotten the alert. The problem, critics have long said, is not so much about Facebook's rules as how it enforces them.“When you elevate free expression as your highest value, other values take a back seat,” Murphy told The Associated Press. The politician exemption, she said, “elevates the speech of people who are already powerful and disadvantages people who are not.”More than 900 companies have joined an advertising boycott of Facebook to protest its handling of hate speech and misinformation.Civil rights leaders who met virtually with Zuckerberg and other Facebook leaders Tuesday expressed skepticism that recommendations from the audit would ever be implemented, noting that past suggestions in previous reports had gone overlooked.“What we get is recommendations that they end up not implementing,” said Rashad Robinson, the executive director of Color for Change, one of several civil rights nonprofits leading an organized boycott of Facebook advertising.Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer, said in a Facebook newsroom post that the company has a long way to go, but is making progress.“This audit has been a deep analysis of how we can strengthen and advance civil rights at every level of our company — but it is the beginning of the journey, not the end,” she wrote. “What has become increasingly clear is that we have a long way to go. As hard as it has been to have our shortcomings exposed by experts, it has undoubtedly been a really important process for our company.”__Associated Press Writer Amanda Seitz contributed to this story.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

The Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] is reiterating its demand for a comprehensive Central agency probe into the gold smuggling case for tracing the conduit and the destination to where the contraband was bound.
 The CPI(M) leadership is insisting on the probe considering the political dimension acquired by the case and the Opposition bid to target the State government.
 Polit Bureau member S. Ramachandran Pilllai told _The Hindu_ that the onus for conducting an inquiry vested with the Centre, but the party and the State government were too keen on instituting a credible probe to ensure that the key conspirators and the real beneficiaries of the smuggling process were brought to book.
 The airport, customs, immigration and all other agencies that wielded the authority to conduct an inquiry in the case were under the control of the Central government. The State government did not have even a vicarious responsibility in monitoring the functioning of the airport or the transactions there.
 ‘‘Still, the party is insisting on a dispassionate inquiry since the incident occurred in the State capital and in view of its serious ramifications that have a direct bearing on national security and diplomatic implications,” Mr. Pillai said.
 As Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had clarified, the party central and State leadership were of the view that the Centre could engage any agency and even seek the help of the Interpol for unearthing the links in the case.
 The Left Democratic Front (LDF) allies and the party were on the same page in this case. The government was committed to initiate action against the guilty irrespective of his rank or position and that had already been proved, he said.
 LDF convener A. Vijayaraghavan too shared Mr. Pillai’s views and clarified that the current controversy would not cast any slur on either the image of the government or the party.
 “No political leader or a person nominated by the party in any official position have been found to be involved in the case. The Chief Minister’s decision in the case of the bureaucrat, M. Sivasankar, on moral grounds, is the best example in this regard. The entire campaign being built up with an eye on the elections will tumble like a bunch of cards,” he said.
 The party would go into a campaign mode once the dust and heat subsides.

Au inceput inscrierile in primul program de tip Executive MBA destinat fermieri romani, sustinut de Raiffeisen Bank. Programul Master in Business of Agriculture (MBAg) va debuta cu o grupa de 30 fermieri selectati din sudul si sud-estul Romaniei, care, timp de 6 luni, vor participa gratuit la cursuri. Programul va incepe in luna septembrie la Slobozia, iar obiectivul sau este sa transforme fermele din Romania in afaceri profitabile si sustenabile. Inscrierile in program au loc in perioada 6 iulie – 2 august. Fermierii care doresc sa se inscrie o pot face direct pe site-ul programului (www.mbag.ro), unde pot consulta calendarul de desfasurare si criteriile de eligibilitate. “Avem toata increderea ca prin intermediul MBAg fermierii nostri vor avea ocazia sa isi completeze cunostintele tehnice, sa isi dezvolte noi abilitati si sa obtina raspunsuri pentru multe din problemele cu care se confrunta. Ne bucuram sa fim alaturi de partenerii nostri in acest proiect educational si asteptam cu nerabdare sa ne cunoastem studentii si sa le impartasim din cunostintele pe care fiecare dintre noi le-a pregatit special pentru sedintele de curs, sa trecem impreuma prin studii de caz ancorate in realitate si sa vizitam ferme care au facut trecerea la revolutia digitala”, a declarat Raluca Nicolescu, director aria IMM la Raiffeisen Bank. Curricula academica a programului de tip master-class va adresa patru nevoi specifice de business – agricultura, management si financiar, vanzari si trading si tehnologie, informatii care vor fi completate de sesiuni de networking, schimburi de experienta in ferme performante, vizite in cadrul centrelor de cercetare si reuniuni cu asociatiile din industrie. In plus, fermierii care vor fi cel mai bine clasati in cadrul programului de absolvire vor putea accesa o serie de beneficii utile fermelor pe care le reprezinta. “Suntem incantati ca, prin implicarea Raiffeisen Bank si a tuturor celorlalti parteneri din proiect, facem bine agriculturii. Ferma de astazi inseamna mult mai mult decat exploatarea unor culturi agricole. Credem ca prin accesul fermierilor romani la informatie de business de calitate contribuim atat la cresterea performantei sectorului agricol, cat si la cresterea calitatii hranei noastre, produsa sustenabil de fermieri profitabili”, a declarat Laurentiu Asimionesei, reprezentantul companiei AMAZAG. Programul MBAg este realizat la initiativa companiilor Syngenta Romania, Raiffeisen Bank Romania, Cargill Agricultura, Agrii Romania, we agri si AMAZAG, in parteneriat cu Universitatea de Stiinte Agronomice si Medicina Veterinara Bucuresti. AMAZAG este o platforma despre agricultura, cu ajutorul careia toti cei care produc sau pun in valoare mancarea, de la ferma la farfurie, pot performa mai bine si prin care consumatorii pot afla cu adevarat de unde provine mancarea. Post-ul Raiffeisen Bank sprijina primul program de tip Executive MBA destinat fermierilor romani apare prima dată în Transilvania Regional Business.
