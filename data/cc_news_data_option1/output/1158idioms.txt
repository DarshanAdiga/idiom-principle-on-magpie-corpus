The grandparents, from Clutton, Somerset, went into isolation on 10 March after realising they formed part of the high-risk category of Brits likely to catch coronavirus.

SYDNEY, MARCH 22: New Zealand abandoned their one-day cricket tour of Australia on Saturday after Wellington tightened border restrictions to combat the spread of coronavirus.       The Blacks Caps lost the opening game of the three-match series by 71 runs and were due to play the second in Sydney on Sunday.       But they will fly home immediately after New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced everyone entering the country from midnight Sunday would have to self-isolate for 14 days.       "In response to the New Zealand government's latest travel restrictions, Cricket Australia has been advised the New Zealand team will be returning home immediately," Cricket Australia said.       The two remaining matches, along with three upcoming Twenty20 clashes between the two countries in New Zealand, were postponed.       "Cricket Australia and New Zealand Cricket will work together to identify a future opportunity to play both series," it added.       Ardern said the self-quarantine order would be reviewed after 16 days.       New Zealand so far only has six confirmed cases of the virus and has recorded no fatalities.       The series in Australia was already being played without fans to curb the spread of coronavirus, which has forced a swathe of sporting events behind closed doors.       After the opening match on Friday, New Zealand fast bowler Lockie Ferguson was tested for the virus and placed in isolation after complaining of a sore throat.       The scare followed Australian paceman Kane Richardson being isolated and        tested for COVID-19 after suffering a sore throat on Thursday. He missed the        opening ODI, but was cleared of the virus late Friday.     -AFP

LOS ANGELES, MARCH 22: Tennis great Serena Williams says she is "on edge" as she practices social distancing recommended by health experts in a bid to slow the spread of coronavirus.       The 23-time Grand Slam champion posted a series of videos on TikTok describing her concerns for her 2-year-old daughter, Olympia.       "Now I've been social distancing for actually a really long time, for probably two weeks now, and every little thing makes me crazy," the 38-year-old superstar said. "And by anxiety I mean I'm just on edge. Any time anyone sneezes around me or coughs I get crazy. I don't hang out with anyone, and when I say anyone I mean my daughter.       "She coughed, I got angry and gave her a side-eye. I gave her that 'angry Serena' and then I got sad.       "I was like, 'Is she OK? Is there something wrong with my daughter? Is there anything I can do?' I just don't know what to do, so instead of being relaxed I'm really under a ton of stress."       Williams said that like many people she first thought the coronavirus wouldn't affect her.       "And then suddenly Indian Wells was cancelled and I was like, 'Oh, OK, that's weird but I have a little time off and I'm going to enjoy that time off,'" she said of her reaction when the prestigious ATP and WTA tournament in Indian Wells, California, was called off earlier this month.-AFP

It's also right in terms of promotion and relegation and Champions League places. These issues are so big for the clubs involved that I imagine there would be a lot of legal fights if the season was just abandoned. The fair thing is to finish 2019-20 - even if we have to lose next season in the process. It wouldn't surprise me if finishing the season takes until the end of 2020. Football, like every other industry, is in unknown territory and, just like every other industry, has to listen to the advice and take all necessary precautions. For me, that rules out finishing the season behind closed doors."

If they do go out, they are mandated to practice our new mantra, “social distancing,” keeping 6 feet between them and the next person.
          The same holds true next door in both New Jersey and Delaware. N.J. Gov. Phil Murphy went so far as to tell people from out of state who own homes at the Jersey shore not to cross the bridge. In Delaware, Gov. John Carney even closed the popular beaches in Rehoboth. Their stay-at-home order kicks in Tuesday.          All of this is being done in a last-ditch effort to get our arms around the ferocious coronavirus outbreak and the COVID-19 illness that comes with it.          On Sunday, Pennsylvania announced state health officials had recorded another 108 people infected with the virus, bringing the state total to 479. The state has recorded three deaths, including the first in Montgomery County, a 72-year-old Abington man.          Across the nation, the numbers are even more daunting. More than 35,000 cases of coronavirus infections have been recorded. The death toll is now approaching 500. Nearly a quarter of the country is now under “stay-at-home” restrictions.          That would include the City of Brotherly Love, but sans the handshake, hugs or high-five.          The city’s edict was fairly stark: Gone are any public or private gathering of any people outside a single household. You can go for a walk, but you can’t walk into a restaurant to place an order. You have to order online and pick it up.          Gov. Wolf, after causing something of a firestorm Thursday night with his edict closing all “non-life-sustaining” businesses, hinted he might soon be issuing similar stay-at-home order.          As it is, after a bit of a reprieve over the weekend – and after his office was inundated with complaints, questions and even a lawsuit or two – started enforcing his ban at 8 a.m. Monday. State police and other local and state agencies are empowered to issue citations and possible fines for businesses found to be in violation of Wolf’s order.          “I want to be honest with you, and what we face,” Wolf said Sunday nights. “What we are trying to do here is buy time ... We cannot overload our health system. If we aren’t successful, the consequences are going to be even more dire than the consequences that we are facing now.”
