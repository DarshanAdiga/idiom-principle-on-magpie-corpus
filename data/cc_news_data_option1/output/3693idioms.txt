Manchester [UK], September 16 (ANI): Australia head coach Justin Langer is not 'confident' over batsman Steve Smith's return in the series decider ODI against England following the blow to the head he suffered before the opening game.   Langer said Smith looked a 'bit rusty' in the net sessions before the third ODI.   "In terms of Smithy, he had a hit today. He still looks a bit rusty, to be honest. We'll give him until the last moment to play but I'm not as confident now as I was 24 hours ago," ESPNcricinfo quoted Langer as saying to SEN Breakfast with Pat and Heals.  
 Smith was struck on the side of the helmet by a throwdown during the practice session. The right-handed batsman had to miss the first two games of the ODI series.   Earlier, Langer was optimistic about Smith's inclusion in the playing XI for the series decider.   "Fingers crossed. We know what a great player he is, he got a blow to the head in training the day before the first game, so we've been going through all the concussion protocols, he's definitely tracking in the right direction," ESPNcricinfo had quoted Langer as saying.   "We're hopeful he'll be right for tomorrow, but if he doesn't come up again, then like always we'll keep him healthy in mind. He did all his running yesterday, did some high speed running, worked hard as part of the protocols, he has ticked every box at the moment, so he will 100 per cent have a bat this afternoon unless he's not feeling well this morning. He'll definitely have a hit this afternoon," he had added.   Aaron Finch-led Australia had won the first ODI against England by 19 runs. However, the visitors lost the second game by 24 runs owing to poor batting performance. The two teams will lock horns in the series decider on later in the day. (ANI)

Il report consiglia di promuovere i comportamenti domestici virtuosi incentivando, ad esempio, le buone pratiche riguardanti gli elettrodomestici piu diffusi (lavatrici e frigoriferi) e quelle legate alla gestione dei riscaldamenti. La ricerca evidenzia infatti che il riscaldamento domestico costituisce la principale voce di spesa energetica per i cittadini e che le ore di accensione invernali risultano, soprattutto nel Settentrione, sovradimensionate rispetto all'attuale situazione climatico-meteorologica. Inoltre, il dato urbano (assenza di minori consumi a fronte di temperature mediamente piu alte a causa delle isole di calore) lascia presupporre che la dimensione psicologica abbia un impatto particolarmente significativo in quest'ambito. È presente, inoltre, l'indicazione di investire sul target emergente delle famiglie mono-componente, che attualmente rappresentano un terzo dei nuclei residenti in Italia e sono caratterizzate da un maggior consumo energetico pro capite rispetto a tutte le altre tipologie familiari.

Owen Valley’s offense struggled after the touchdown drive, finishing with just 15 yards in the air and 117 on the ground.
 The Patriot defense held their own, allowing just 158 yards rushing and 60 yards passing.
 “Our defense played well most of the game… they did a really good job,” Coach Potts noted. “Our offense had one good opening drive and then just didn’t effectively move the ball after that. We did at times, but we didn’t hook enough positive plays together.”
 Junior Jerry McBee and sophomore Dilon Risk led the Patriots in tackles with 10 each, including two tackles for loss of yards of Risk. Senior Noah Roberts and freshman Cale Nickless each had a tackle for loss. Junior Bryer LeCocq intercepted an Edgewood pass in the game.
 “I love our kids… one of the best groups of guys I’ve been around and they’ll got to fight and battle for our community any day of the week, at the drop of a hat, but we didn’t finish tonight and that’s the bottom line,” Potts commented. “We have a lot of resolve though and we’ll be back next week.”
 The Patriots will host the Northview Knights this Friday for homecoming. The game is set to kickoff at 7 p.m.

The franchise then managed to name a good replacement in the form of Adam Zampa. The Australian spinner has been in good form and he has been spinning a web on the English batsmen in the ongoing ODI series.   The IPL 2020 will be played in the UAE so spinners are expected to have a field day on slow and low pitches. Yuzvendra Chahal, Zampa, Moeen Ali are the high-profile names in the spin department and they would be relied upon heavily to do the job. RCB also has Washington Sundar as an option so for the first time in the last five years, Kohli has a side that can possibly go all the way this year. The bowling attack looks the most settled this year and if batting manages to compliment the bowling, RCB can expect to have a solid season.

A personal trainer also occasionally comes by to work with the students on some exercises.
 While they enjoy the freedom between classes, the students also like the structure of having somewhere they have to be at a certain time, said Krisma Jackson, another of the housing authority's youth services coordinators.
 “Kids love structure, even if they may not say so,” she said.
 In their own homes, the internet service might be spotty, and their parents might be at work, or may work nights and sleep during the day, said Ann Ryan, director of family services for the authority.
 The centers provide a hub where the students can connect with their classes, get a snack, and the staff can follow up with them to make sure things are going smoothly, she said.
 The program is funded through contributions from a variety of organizations, as well as with federal money from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, said Kevin Lollar, the housing authority's executive director.
 Getting everything up and running smoothly for virtual learning has been an adventure. The program will continue to morph and evolve as distance learning does, Chapman said.
 But they'll continue to provide a place of consistency and support for kids who may need it in uncertain times.
 As he stood outside a room where first- and second-graders hunched over their Chromebooks, Lollar referred to the old aphorism that it takes a village to raise a child.
 “We're the village,” he said.
