There’s a lot of Zoom happy-hour things or Facebook groups or whatever it might be. We’re looking for more of these social engagements with people in the games industry, where you’re not even selling to them. You’re just making those connections, developing relationships, and that can lead to business down the road.

Mill Run (4-8) finished fourth and was scheduled to host the Fayette Raiders in the play-in game on Friday at 6 p.m. But, the game might be pushed up to Thursday due to weather concerns. The winner of the play-in game travels to Masontown on Sunday at a time to be determined.
 "We were going to play this like this game mattered," said Krause. "We have to get better. We had to play it to the hilt."
 The pitchers controlled the first three innings with the Copperheads' Nate Torbich allowing just one runner on an error in the third inning and Mill Run youngster Kole Koontz allowing singles to Brody Bonadio to start the game and John Przybylinski in the third inning. Bonadio was erased on an inning-ending double play.
 "I thought Kole threw a nice game," praised Ray Orndorff. "Kole gave us what we needed tonight."
 Carmichaels finally got to Koontz in the fourth inning.
 Brody Bonadio was safe on an infield error to start the rally. Joby Lapkowicz ripped a line drive to center field to score Bonadio. Chuck Gasti's single moved Lapkowicz to third.
