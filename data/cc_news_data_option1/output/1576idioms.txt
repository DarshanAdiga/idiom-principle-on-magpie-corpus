WASHINGTON (AP) — Congress is sprinting to approve the next coronavirus aid package, a $483 billion deal backed by the White House to replenish a small-business payroll fund and pump more money into hospitals and testing programs.President Donald Trump is urging swift passage this week. The Senate approved the bill Tuesday and the House planned a vote on Thursday.The bipartisan bill, Washington's fourth in response to the crisis, is not expected to be the last as lawmakers take unprecedented steps to confront the virus and prop up communities nationwide amid the health crisis.Most of the funding, $331 billion, would go to boost a small-business payroll loan program that ran out of money last week. There would be $100 billion for health care, with $75 billion to hospitals and $25 billion to boost testing for the virus, a key step in building the confidence required to reopen state economies. There is $60 billion for a small-business loans and grants.What started as a Trump administration effort with Republicans to bolster the government's small-business Paycheck Protection Program quickly doubled in size, second only to the nearly $2 trillion coronavirus rescue package that became law last month.As negotiations dragged on, Democratic demands for additional funds for hospitals and virus testing in the states became more pressing, and eventually gained support from Republicans.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said the bill was made "better and broader" by the effort from Democrats.Of the $25 billion for increased testing efforts, at least $11 billion goes to state and tribal governments to detect and track new infections. The rest will help fund federal research into new coronavirus testing options.Currently, the U.S. has tested roughly 4 million people for the virus, or just over 1% of its population, according to the Covid Tracking Project website.While the White House says the U.S. has enough testing to begin easing social distancing measures, most experts say capacity needs to increase at least threefold, if not more.As announced Tuesday, the centerpiece of the deal remains the small-business payroll program. It provides forgivable loans so shops can continue paying workers while businesses remain closed for social distancing and stay-at-home orders.Launched just weeks ago, the paycheck program quickly reached its lending limit after approving nearly 1.7 million loans. That left thousands of small businesses in limbo as they sought help.Controversies dogged its rocky roll-out and Democrats highlighted the number of smaller and minority-owned shops missing out on the aid. A number of publicly traded, big-name corporations also received loans, drawing complaints and Trump's vow that some will be asked to return the money.As part of the new agreement, $60 billion or so has been set aside for — and divided equally among — smaller banks and community lenders, a nod to neighborhoods and rural areas underserved by banks."This is a significant package," said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., ahead of Tuesday's vote.The Senate swiftly approved it by consent late Tuesday, despite opposition from key conservatives, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah.The House has asked lawmakers, who have been at home with Congress all but shuttered, to return Thursday for a roll-call vote.Missing from the package, however, was extra funding for state and local governments staring down budget holes and desperate to avert furloughs and layoffs of workers needed to keep communities running.Trump said he was open to including in a subsequent virus aid package fiscal relief for state and local government — Democrats had wanted such funding for the current bill — along with infrastructure projects.At the White House, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin outlined the contours of the next bill, which he said should include the president's long-promised effort to rebuild roads, bridges and, especially as Americans stay home, broadband.But facing Republican unease over the White House's deal-making with Democrats, McConnell indicated he is unwilling to engage in another round of negotiations on his own, without calling senators back for a full vote.He welcomed the White House plans to start reopening the economy, and signaled similar for Congress."Unless we get our economy up and running again, there's not any way we can spend enough to continue to prop up the country," McConnell said.The House planned to vote on a proposal to allow proxy voting during the pandemic, a first for Congress, which has required in-person business essentially since its founding."The House must show the American people that we continue to work hard on their behalf," Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., wrote to colleagues.Many lawmakers are wary of boarding airplanes to Washington and crowding back into cramped offices and meeting spaces. But the landmark rules change met with objections from conservative Republicans."Congress should be in session," said Rep. Clay Higgins, R-La.Congress is not scheduled to fully resume until May 4, but officials continue to watch virus projections and the District of Columbia remains under stay-at-home rules.___Associated Press writers Matthew Perrone, Mary Clare Jalonick and Matthew Daly contributed to this report.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

MUMBAI - Novak Djokovic has called on the tennis world to contribute to a relief fund for players struggling financially during the coronavirus shutdown and to show lower-ranked professionals that they have not been forgotten.          The men’s ATP Tour, the WTA, which runs the women’s circuit, along with the International Tennis Federation and organisers of the four Grand Slams, are creating a fund to help players affected by the shutdown.          The tennis season was suspended in March due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the shutdown will continue at least until mid-July, depriving lower-level players, who depend solely on tournament winnings, of the chance to earn a living.          ATP Player Council chief Djokovic had previously proposed a model for higher-ranked players to donate funds after holding discussions with fellow council members Roger Federer and Rafa Nadal.          “I am really privileged to be able to use my status of being a top player that can, in this times, raise the awareness of players that are struggling,” the world number one said during an Instagram chat with Italy’s Fabio Fognini on Tuesday.          “I personally have earned enough money to live for many more years without playing tennis.”          Djokovic did not want to disclose the size of the fund before an official announcement was made but said several million dollars would be raised.          “Players individually can help as much as they want,” said Djokovic. “It’s difficult to pressure players into giving money, whatever their ranking is.          “I understand that there are differences in opinions. So I invite anybody who likes tennis, who wants tennis to survive as a sport (to donate).”          While tennis is a lucrative sport for those at the top, those in the lower echelons often struggle to make ends meet.          Djokovic, a 17-times Grand Slam champion who has earned some $144 million in career prize money, said he had heard many players were contemplating giving up the sport.          “This is a significant issue for our sport,” the 32-year-old Serb said.          “The sport has to think how we will expand the base. We have to expand this number as much as we can.          “I feel that the players should show the solidarity and show the unity in this moment, show these lower-ranked players that we do not forget about them.”          Djokovic did not expect to see regular tournaments starting again soon as players would be unable to travel freely due to restrictions imposed to contain the spread of the new coronavirus.          “I think there will be more regional prize money tournaments. I think this is what’s going to happen very soon,” he said, adding that those events were unlikely to award ranking points.

India’s largest software services firm Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) will launch Israel’s first fully digital bank in what is being seen as a trans-formative initiative that can impact the business model of other sectors as well.           TCS was selected by Israel’s Ministry of Finance to transform its banking sector by building a banking service bureau that would serve as a shared, plug-and-play, digital banking operations platform — powered by the TCS BaNCS Global Banking Platform - to help start-up banks launch their operations very quickly, the company said in a press release.          “This initiative is seen as a bid to boost competition in the financial services sector, spark greater innovation and enhance customer experience by democratising access to banking in Israel by making financial services accessible to the consumer,” the release said.          “It will serve as an online financial superstore through which an ecosystem of providers of services and products, such as insurance and credit cards, can reach out to the new generation of digital natives,” it added.           The yet to be named digital bank is the first to receive a banking license in Israel in over 40 years and is to be launched in 2021. The fully digital bank will have no physical branches and will provide Israeli citizens with all the services that regular brick and mortar banks offer, including credit, deposits, loans, account management, securities trading and processing.           The new bank will also have access to all of Bank of Israel’s liquidity tools and various payment systems.           We have achieved a key milestone in the Israeli financial services industry by being onboarded on to TCS’ Banking Services Bureau. This approach will reduce the cost of banking for the average citizen and foster the development of innovative and differentiated services,” Shouky Oren, the Chairman of the new bank, was quoted as saying.           TCS is uniquely positioned to deliver these services due to its market ready and industry leading TCS BaNCS Global Banking Platform as well as its ecosystem integration, Oren noted.           Its API-enabled components support wealth management and retail, corporate and private banking, including digital banking for all segments. The platform has been installed successfully at 450 sites so far with around the clock availability.           The government of Israel is on a path to transform banking in the country with the services bureau transformation initiative. TCS is proud to be the preferred partner and play a vital part in the democratisation of the financial services industry in the country,” TCS Israel’s country head, Eyal Moskal, was quoted as saying.

There has been an online news spreading rumours that the Zimbabwean government is funnelling  millions of Corona virus dollars  to  a Mnangagwa-linked company. The article maintained that the Zimbabwe government is funnelling US$60 million to a company linked to President Emmerson Mnangagwa's son, Collins, in a murky coronavirus drugs deal, this was reported by an online tabloid ZimLive reported Monday.  The tabloid normally does not cook up stories and indeed they are told the stories by  some people claiming to be close reliable sources.  They claimed that a little-known company called Drax Consult SAGL, which is registered in international tax haven, Switzerland, and represented in Zimbabwe by Delish Nguwaya has been supplying drugs to the NatPharm, the government drugs firm, in a separate US$22.5 million arrangement since September last year.
 These allegations of corruption against the company were a "conspiracy" aimed at tarnishing the name of the president and Zimbabwe as a country. They hope to remove the president from the political scene by fielding lies and jeopardising Zimbabwe's chances of  getting assistance during this Corona virus.  The tabloid was misled by its sources that   Nguwaya, is a business partner of Mnangagwa's son, Collins And that Nguwaya has a colourful criminal past – including multiple arrests for armed robbery, cocaine possession and extortion.   Mr D Nguwaya on the contrary is a decorated  dedicated Zimbabwean business man whose interest is to help the country go through difficult times.
 The issue mentioned in the tabloid is misleading and indeed not correct. The medication which is supplied to Natpham was bought in October 2019. These drugs are now with Natpharm with bulk of it already distributed to government hospitals.
 These drugs could not have been for Corona virus since they were bought in October 2019. By this time there was no Corona virus or any pandemic in Zimbabwe.
 For the benefit of any doubt the funding was applied from the government as a loan  this application was only  approved in October 2019. Even by then there was no word about Corona. So saying that the funding was meant for Corona virus is mischievous unreasonable and highly provocative.
 The assertions of corruption were brought against NguVaya by the bogus business persons who wanted to venture on the same trade.  These are the ones fuelling gossip and intending to tarnish the image of his Excellency.
 The publishing of such lies is not only harmful to Nguwaya but to Zimbabwe as a whole.   Considering that we are in a pandemic period one wonders why would a patriot publish such lies. Is it out of the love for Zimbabwe it is it the lack of it. The government of Zimbabwe made an appeal for assistance following the pandemic. In a sign of nationalism Nguwaya at State House on 18 April 2020 appeared at the state house event and donated over 2000.000 US dollars in response to government appeals following the outbreak.
 Nguwaya represents a company which provided the drugs to Zimbabwe. The company is registered in Switzerland and it rose to the occasion.  The drugs are now coming with some  drugs now in Dubai and India waiting for the aeroplanes to resume flights.
 These drugs were sent on the strength of the 20 million dollars which was loaned to them by the ministry of finance on 2 October 2019.  The letter of approval is in our possession.
 It was only in 2020  March the company requested a top up of  40 million dollars which was approved on the  6th March 2020 but wit a wider supply of things like digital thermometers,oxygen,gauges,masks,ultra sound scanners, laboratory equipment among other things.   The facility only spread the needs to cover other areas. At no time was this funding for Corona virus and saying The president is milking the treasury is a malicious mischievous  and low aiming political chancing.
 Zimbabwe can not afford to have a bad name spread out there when we are facing a very formidable unseen enemy. The Corona virus.
 It is granted that Nguwaya has  strew of allegations which follows him everywhere but he was never convicted of any of the allegations. The allegations should not become reality in the absence of a conviction.  It's only business enemies of Nguwaya who are poking their spears in the future of others.   We are all folly we have the past and we have moved on. In the process of trying to injure Navaya these business haters are dragging the name of Zimbabwe and the president in the mud.
 Looking at the whole story the letter from the Perm sec Guvamatanga approved the funding in the best interest of Zimbabwe. This was not an issue of tender. Zimbabwe needs the drugs now and it is on this ground that funding is to be provided to sail through our health issues.
 This is a mater of national health and national priority.   Now to try to connect Nguwaya to Collin Mnangagwa is laughable. Someone must at least grow up.  The tabloid quoted Mr Guvamatanga. "The new dispensation is comprised of people with commercial experience" allowing "products or services to come into the country on certain terms." This explains why there was no need for tender in the desperate times.
 In trying to mislead the public the article tried to exploit the relationship between  Collins Mnangagwa and Nguwaya. This is a desperate attempt to tarnish the president. The drugs delivered by Nguwaya to Zimbabwe are helping our own people in the hospitals. Mr Nguwaya is delivering and even donating to the state. It is this kind of a person the enemies are trying to raise his past against him.
 In January this year, the finance ministry's permanent secretary George Guvamatanga said Drax had delivered drugs worth US$2.5 million, and they were in talks to supply more drugs and equipment to the tune of US$20 million. The lock down has grounded a number of airlines and cargos.  This has delayed delivery of consignments which is now in Dubai some in India. All this has nothing to do with Corona virus.
 The allegations against Mr Collins Mnangagwa focus on his relationship with the controversial Nguvaya which was accused of influencing cabinet appointments and winning lucrative state business  through corruption.   He has also been accused of taking bribes from logistics firms trusted to ferry the drugs.   Collins denied allegations of wrongdoing he is not in direct business with Nguwaya even though they know each other.
 "I have been vilified, alleged to be the king of corrupt people,   I have been given every other name and I have never responded to those issues,"  Nguwaya said in response to these frivolous allegations.   Nguwaya  on the 'conspiracy' against him He lashed out, in detail - and with fury - at what he said was a decades-long conspiracy against him.
 He implied that one independent MO and Business man have been - and still are - part of an elaborate plot to discredit him, and the president of Zimbabwe even as he tried to bring drugs to help Zimbabwe.   Their eyes are are not on the work done but on shaking the bee hive. They are self destructive and indeed they are totally lost and wondering in the jungle of confusion.
 Mr Nguwaya alleged that thise who gave damning evidence against him, are part of the plot to destabilise his business and tarnish the good name of Zimbabwe.   Mr Nguwaya said he found the Mnangagwa family very friendly and he wonders why the papers are trying to tarnish their image.
 "I never did anything with them unlawfully. They just remained friends, as they were friends to everybody else," Mr Nguwaya said.   He objected to allegations that he had been given the Corona virus contract to bring medication for COVID 19. He denies the allegations that Mnangagwa has allowed the state to be "captured" by the cartels and had auctioned the country.
 Nguwaya painted a picture of an alleged conspiracy dating back more than two decades to destroy him.   "I have been provoked," he said, as he threatened to name alleged people who are after his business and after the head of the first family.   People are trying to soil the president and are busy trying to label any one who is around his family.
 The truth is Mnangagwa the president of Zimbabwe has no Knowlledge of any money given to him by Collins or Nguwaya. The president does not need any monies for himself. Collins Mnangagwa is an adult and does not do his business riding on his father, uncle or grandfather. He stands for himself. It is an insult to him and what he stands for.
 Nguwaya might have a rotten past but those were allegations. In Zimbabwe we believe in the rule that you are not guilty until convicted.  Which means you are innocent until proven guilty.   As Zimbabweans we need to have responsible reporting. How will these lies make the country look. Very soon we will need help Corona virus is deadly. People are dying. If you start telling donors that their money is being stollen without any evidence what are you hoping for the nation.
 There is no Corona virus money dispatched to any company yet. Mnangagwa is not corrupt and can not create a whole  in his own pocket neither will he allow his son to act dubiously in any way.   We need to call upon God to save the nation from Corona virus. We do not need devils behind their computers to curse our country. God bless Zimbabwe.

As a rule, always invest in safer options like bank deposits and debt mutual funds to take care of your financial goals below five years. For long-term goals, you can start investing in equity mutual funds. It is extremely important to choose debt mutual funds based on your investment horizon and risk appetite. For example, you should invest in a liquid scheme if you are looking to park money for a few weeks. If you are investing for a year or two, you may go for short term mutual funds.

 Bilic's argument comes days after Robins owner Lansdown revealed that it could be autumn before crowds return - but that the season should be completed beforehand.
 "To be honest I can't imagine we'll be playing in front of crowds until the autumn," Lansdown said to talkSPORT.

Amaal Mallik who produced for the song also appreciated Young Zwann for his hard work and also mentioned how he immediately connected with his vibe and his lyrics. He says, "He has worked really hard given about 50 to 60 takes and I’m glad we have released a banging track." The duo met through one of Amaal’s childhood friends, Shiva Maheshwari who’s also the executive producer of Jung. After Amaal listened to Young Zwann’s lyrics and decided to get on board to produce for the song, Shiva was pleasantly surprised because there are very few established singers like Amaal who are open to giving independent artists a chance. He said, "Amaal and I go way back! But I honestly was surprised and super elated when he decided to produce for Jung! I know there’s also a trust factor that we share given we’ve known each other for so long, but it was really kind of him to do this!"

Bulawayo vendors have proposed government protection from service providers during lockdown when they are not able to generate any income because their operations are a bit suppressed.
 Bulawayo Vendors and Traders Association (BVTA) said it has been talking to our members to find out what they think and what they feel, should the lockdown be extended.
 "What we have gathered from them is that life will be very difficult since they live on hand to mouth and they have not been selling for the past 19 days which means they do not have any savings. It will be month-end soon and they will need to pay their rentals, hence they are saying it will be very difficult for the relationships between them and their landlords, relationships will be strained," said BVTA.
 "They are proposing that the government should come up with measures that will ensure that they are protected. They are now buying food in townships and the prices are very exorbitant so it is very difficult to survive. Vendors are calling on government to ensure that people can buy food from the CBD."
 The association said its members when they are buying mealie-meal in townships, there are different price regimes as in some shops it is sold in cash for 75 Bond whereas the government was saying mealie-meal can be bought either with cash, Ecocash or swipe.
 "In this case people are being told that they cannot buy using Ecocash or swipe. They say the other worrying factor is that COVID-19 cases are increasing in Bulawayo, so if the government suspends the lock down and people start gathering again it would pose a serious threat to their lives because the virus would be spread all over as people would be doing as they please," BVTA said.
 "BVTA members are calling on government that should the lock down be lifted, it should set up mechanisms which include setting up of testing facilities in shopping centres in the CBD, where people can be tested before getting into the shops. They pointed out that the government should try by all means to enforce the World Health Organisation's recommended social distancing and provide protective clothing for people selling in the markets e.g. the government of India gives vendors protective clothing and has been enforcing social distancing in the markets."
  The association said members are of the view that Zimbabwe was not in a lock down as people were gathering but was in a slowdown kind of strategy since people still queue in the shops, not observing the social distancing.
 "In their view, the government must play a critical role in ensuring that the lockdown concept is fully implemented.  Those are some of the ideas coming from our members and we are hoping that the government will come up with safety nets but the problem now is that the government has been promising them for the past 19 days that it was going to make some cash transfers for them to be able to be cushioned and buy food as they have not been working," the association said.
 "They have been waiting for the past two weeks and few days but nothing has materialised and they are calling on government to ensure that such schemes are expedited so that they are able to survive. BVTA members are saying should the lockdown be extended, government should ensure that it puts in place mechanisms that will ensure that they are taken care of so that they do not starve with their families since they are not working."
 The association said some are saying they were not given enough time to prepare and buy enough commodities for them to be able to survive in the lockdown and they did not even plan for their businesses to come up with alternative ideas on how they could survive and they are saying government could have given them some time to prepare for the lockdown.
 "We will continue encouraging our members to practise hygiene and maintain social distancing to minimise the spread of COVID19," the BVTA director Micheal Ndiweni said in an interview transcribed from Skyz Metro FM Radio.

Trading worth billions of dollars has shifted to kitchen tables or bedrooms as traders work through the coronavirus crisis from home, testing patchy fixes to make sure they stick to the rules.
 Far away from the strict confines of a dealing room, compliance officers find they can no longer eavesdrop on staff, leaving some banks and brokers worried that the activities of their traders under lockdown could come back to haunt them. "Compliance personnel can't walk the floors and look to see what's actually happening and hear some of the conversations," Rachel Sexton, head of EY's financial services forensic and integrity practice in London, said of the new arrangements.
 And after facing multi-billion dollar fines for trying to rig currency markets and Libor interest rates, financial firms are relying on their compliance teams as a key line of defence against malpractice and keeping regulators off their backs. "There are a number of questions in terms of how does a bank convey into the living room all the great work done in instilling cultural and ethical behaviour?" Martin Pluves, chief executive of Britain's FICC Markets Standards Board, said.
 This was set up to improve conduct in fixed income and commodity markets and Pluves is planning a series of "sprints" for participants to help them head off potential conduct traps. Meanwhile, banks have been asking regulators for reassurance they will not face sanctions once the pandemic has passed, a senior compliance official for a global broker dealer said.
 The biggest task has been making sure that traders do not use personal phones for work and that all transactions have an electronic trail that regulators can check for any market abuse. "For the most part regulators have been understanding about audit trail issues, but only the CFTC has given real relief on potential voice recording issues," the officer said, adding that there had been some difficulties with transactions such as doing so-called block trades from home.
 "Working from home was very rare before the pandemic, it would be just for the top trader that had a home in the Hamptons," said Tim Carmody, chief technology officer at IPC, a Jersey City based financial systems company. But the weekend retreat of wealthy New Yorkers has been joined by apartments from Auckland to London and Boston as banks and brokerages scrambled to keep business going during the crisis.
 To help banks meet compliance rules, Carmody said IPC installed 10,000 voice recording systems in traders' homes in the United States and Europe between the beginning of March and mid-April as national lockdowns were rolled out. "We have seen which customers were prepared for this and which ones scrambled a bit," he said, adding that while deep pocketed big banks installed hundreds if not thousands of kits in traders' homes, smaller institutions have struggled.
 RUN TO CATCH UP As the coronavirus crisis has unfolded, regulators around the globe have rapidly had to adapt their rules to keep the wheels of finance whirring.
 That has led to some unorthodox fixes such as the European Union's securities watchdog simply telling traders to take notes of calls if they get stuck. "Compliance have had to run to catch up to understand what processes have changed," EY's Sexton said.
 Some banks have redeployed compliance staff into customer services roles to help deal with the wave of requests for help from their clients, piling pressure on those trying to stay on top of not only trading floors but areas such as accounting. "It's a difficult time and many companies will be struggling, so there is the incentive to cook the books here more than there might have been," said Sexton, adding that EY is seconding some of its own staff to banks.
 Banks in Britain have had to move some compliance staff to the front line to help answer calls from millions of customers wanting a repayment holiday for their mortgage or a loan. The Financial Conduct Authority has warned lenders they must treat customers fairly in the pandemic and not repeat the shoddy treatment of clients seen in the last crisis a decade ago.
 Some compliance cannot be done during the pandemic, however, such as full reviews of trading practices. "It's hard to do that when you are not sitting at the desk and watching what's going on. Some parts of it you really can't do," the senior compliance officer said.
 As banks look to life beyond the coronavirus crisis, some such as IPC's Carmody see signs that working patterns will change now that the rubicon has been crossed. "You could see traders work from home on a Friday."

A prequel to The Hunger Games movie franchise is in the works.            Suzanne Collins's popular young adult novel trilogy was adapted into four hugely successful films starring Jennifer Lawrence, Liam Hemsworth, and Josh Hutcherson between 2012 and 2015.             Officials at Lionsgate, the studio behind the franchise, announced on Tuesday that they would also be making a movie adaptation of Collins's upcoming prequel novel, The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, which is due to be released on 19 May.            "Suzanne's new book has been worth the wait. It offers everything fans could hope for and expect from The Hunger Games while also breaking new ground and introducing an entirely new canvas of characters," said Joe Drake, chairman of the Lionsgate Motion Picture Group, in a statement.             The new novel follows an 18-year-old Coriolanus Snow, who would eventually rise to become the tyrannical ruler of the dystopian nation of Panem, and the central villain of the original Hunger Games series.           Snow, who was portrayed by Donald Sutherland in the franchise, is chosen to be a mentor for 10th annual Hunger Games, for a young girl from District 12, the future home of Lawrence's heroine Katniss Everdeen.            Collins, who will also serve as an executive producer of the new film, added, "Lionsgate has always been the cinematic home of The Hunger Games, and I'm delighted to be returning to them with this new book."             The prequel adaptation will serve a reunion for some behind-the-scenes crew. Francis Lawrence - no relation to Jennifer Lawrence - will return to the director's chair after helming Catching Fire, Mockingjay - Part 1, and Mockingjay - Part 2, while Nina Jacobson, who produced all of the films in the franchise, will produce the latest film, along with her partner Brad Simpson.             Collins will write the film's treatment and Michael Arndt, who previously helped write Catching Fire, will adapt the screenplay.

If there are signs of containment of the virus around the Q1 earnings announcement, there is a possibility of a healthy upside for the stock.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Congress is sprinting to approve the next coronavirus aid package, a $483 billion deal backed by the White House to replenish a small-business payroll fund and pump more money into hospitals and testing programs.President Donald Trump is urging swift passage this week. The Senate approved the bill Tuesday and the House planned a vote on Thursday.The bipartisan bill, Washington's fourth in response to the crisis, is not expected to be the last as lawmakers take unprecedented steps to confront the virus and prop up communities nationwide amid the health crisis.Most of the funding, $331 billion, would go to boost a small-business payroll loan program that ran out of money last week. There would be $100 billion for health care, with $75 billion to hospitals and $25 billion to boost testing for the virus, a key step in building the confidence required to reopen state economies. There is $60 billion for a small-business loans and grants.What started as a Trump administration effort with Republicans to bolster the government's small-business Paycheck Protection Program quickly doubled in size, second only to the nearly $2 trillion coronavirus rescue package that became law last month.As negotiations dragged on, Democratic demands for additional funds for hospitals and virus testing in the states became more pressing, and eventually gained support from Republicans.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said the bill was made "better and broader" by the effort from Democrats.Of the $25 billion for increased testing efforts, at least $11 billion goes to state and tribal governments to detect and track new infections. The rest will help fund federal research into new coronavirus testing options.Currently, the U.S. has tested roughly 4 million people for the virus, or just over 1% of its population, according to the Covid Tracking Project website.While the White House says the U.S. has enough testing to begin easing social distancing measures, most experts say capacity needs to increase at least threefold, if not more.As announced Tuesday, the centerpiece of the deal remains the small- business payroll program. It provides forgivable loans so shops can continue paying workers while businesses remain closed for social distancing and stay- at-home orders.Launched just weeks ago, the paycheck program quickly reached its lending limit after approving nearly 1.7 million loans. That left thousands of small businesses in limbo as they sought help.Controversies dogged its rocky roll-out and Democrats highlighted the number of smaller and minority-owned shops missing out on the aid. A number of publicly traded, big- name corporations also received loans, drawing complaints and Trump's vow that some will be asked to return the money.As part of the new agreement, $60 billion or so has been set aside for — and divided equally among — smaller banks and community lenders, a nod to neighborhoods and rural areas underserved by banks."This is a significant package," said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., ahead of Tuesday's vote.The Senate swiftly approved it by consent late Tuesday, despite opposition from key conservatives, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah.The House has asked lawmakers, who have been at home with Congress all but shuttered, to return Thursday for a roll-call vote.Missing from the package, however, was extra funding for state and local governments staring down budget holes and desperate to avert furloughs and layoffs of workers needed to keep communities running.Trump said he was open to including in a subsequent virus aid package fiscal relief for state and local government — Democrats had wanted such funding for the current bill — along with infrastructure projects.At the White House, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin outlined the contours of the next bill, which he said should include the president's long-promised effort to rebuild roads, bridges and, especially as Americans stay home, broadband.But facing Republican unease over the White House's deal-making with Democrats, McConnell indicated he is unwilling to engage in another round of negotiations on his own, without calling senators back for a full vote.He welcomed the White House plans to start reopening the economy, and signaled similar for Congress."Unless we get our economy up and running again, there's not any way we can spend enough to continue to prop up the country," McConnell said.The House planned to vote on a proposal to allow proxy voting during the pandemic, a first for Congress, which has required in-person business essentially since its founding."The House must show the American people that we continue to work hard on their behalf," Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., wrote to colleagues.Many lawmakers are wary of boarding airplanes to Washington and crowding back into cramped offices and meeting spaces. But the landmark rules change met with objections from conservative Republicans."Congress should be in session," said Rep. Clay Higgins, R-La.Congress is not scheduled to fully resume until May 4, but officials continue to watch virus projections and the District of Columbia remains under stay-at-home rules.___Associated Press writers Matthew Perrone, Mary Clare Jalonick and Matthew Daly contributed to this report.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.
