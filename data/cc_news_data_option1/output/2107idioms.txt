And now, the darkness of night melts away into vivid dreams of the aforementioned pig-fuckers. Goofy, stammering, eugenicist Gates with his vision of vaccinating the entire planet. Fauci and Birx listening in horror as Pompeo announces loudly and clearly that we're in a live exercise…meaning what? Fauci's eyes grow big as saucers while an uncontrollable shiver goes down Birx's spine as she shudders and strokes her arm. They use a live military exercise to launch this War on the Carnauba Virus, and Trump angrily complains that somebody should have told him. This is indeed a war, for the first casualty has become the truth. Biden, now seldom seen maskless, leading the aimless minions of low-expectation Democrats in a mass-death-leap off the cliffs of desperation. WHO admitting to the development of sterility vaccines, amid accusations of live use in Kenya, Tanzania, Nicaragua, Mexico, and The Philippines. Bug-eyed Schiff demanding censorship of any information outside the official WHO/CDC song and dance from the likes of Facebook, Google, YouTube, Twitter, Amazon, and EVERYWHERE!…effectively eliminating any chance of the truth leaking into the national conversation. Nobody bothers censoring lies. So if you have any complaints about the content of this little article, chill out. You're likely the only one reading it anyway. What's happening here, Mr. Jones, is so heinously convoluted that nearly the entire country is marching in masked, socially distanced lockstep. Even many people who I thought would see through the information fog. Fear and distrust so thick, I need a machete to cut through it. And all for a virus so puny that the media can't even conjure up decent footage of all this make believe death and suffering.

The hospice movement had some thought-provoking beginnings, at least the modern version. Of course, the good offices of monks and nuns had cared for the dying in medieval times and before. In the modern version, Dame Cicely Saunders is credited with beginning the movement with her London hospice in 1967. She was nurse, social worker and doctor, and dedicated her (much- decorated) life to helping the terminally ill. Saunders brought compassionate (“palliative”) care to patients’ last days, advocating they die in their own time, and “naturally.” She _did_ , however, introduce the use of morphine to ease pain. Her philosophy was somewhat different from America’s hospice pioneer, Florence Wald, dean of Yale nursing. Wald, in 1974, brought “assisted suicide” and “euthanasia” to her Connecticut hospice. What has evolved in the American hospice industry seems to be a very successful melding of the image of Dame Saunders’ “compassionate” care with the use and apparent abuse of assisted suicide and what author and former hospice nurse Roger Gantz calls “stealth euthanasia.”

The more I think about it, the more likely it seems that we have no other choice than to get in lockstep, don masks, do what we're told, and get ready for our new digital lives. Zoom is so very much more satisfying than a sweaty, nasty, human hug and face to face conversation. An added benefit being you can cut it off at any time, and claim you lost your internet connection. At the rate humans have been reproducing, we're doomed. This dream of democracy has turned out to be quite a nightmare too. The difference between the two parties can be measured in millimeters, and it's long been recognized that voting is an act of futility, so let's let the well intentioned billionaires who are staging this Corrosive Virus Plandemic run the show from now on. They've been doing a fine job behind our backs for quite some time now, and let's just hand over to them the keys to the kingdom. All kingdoms. Heaven included, I would guess. Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose, and it looks more and more like we'll all be free, in one way or another, very soon.

TVCA chief executive Julie Gilhespie, who said the report was “pretty comprehensive”, will lead the restructuring with a view to having the new arrangements in place by next April.
 Neither the former chief executive of the South Tees Development Corporation (STDC), David Allison, or the ex-managing director of Teesside International Airport Limited, David Grant, who departed in April this year and September last year respectively, will be replaced and day to day operational management of these organisations will be undertaken by the respective director groups already in place.
 Meanwhile, the new executive team, which will comprise Ms Gilhespie, group finance director Gary MacDonald and group commercial director Alison Fellows, are intended to provide strategic management and oversight and be responsible for TVCA’s investment plan.
 Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen recently faced criticism over the expansion of his senior management team from police commissioner Barry Coppinger, with the overall cost of staff salaries in this category rising from £1.55m in 2016/17 to £3.9m this financial year.
 The report states that given the significant changes in structure and individual responsibilities, a team from the Local Government Association has been commissioned to undertake a review of relevant salaries and make recommendations as to any appropriate changes.

There is a certain type of student who enters the field of culinary arts with a clear vision of becoming a chef. Taylor Ponte was such a student. In UH Maui College’s Culinary Arts Program, he was always eager to volunteer, came early to class, stayed late, and learned outside the classroom. He read cookbooks avidly and followed the careers of notable chefs. He was not afraid of challenges. He dove into the prestigious Chaine de Rotisseurs Young Chef Competition, seizing the opportunity to transform the contents of a mystery basket into a three-course menu in just three-and-a-half hours. He was inspired by his peers and became a protégé of Jonathan Mizukami, another UH Maui culinary school graduate who had gone on to become a sous chef at The French Laundry and executive chef of Vintage Cave Restaurant, then touted as O‘ahu’s top culinary venue. Ponte spent a summer with Mizukami, staging at Vintage Cave.
