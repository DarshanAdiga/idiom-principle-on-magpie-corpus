Who Biden chooses as his running mate -- reconciling their views with his campaign -- may prove the ultimate deciding factor. Senators Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren were both tapped as potential vice president candidates by Biden's camp. Both have endorsed multiple pieces of cannabis legislation in the U.S. Congress and were also vocal supporters of cannabis legalization during the primaries.
 Brookings Institution senior fellow John Hudak recently noted that cannabis legalization may be popular among U.S. voters, but it isn't salient. Many already have access to marijuana products through legal and illicit markets.
 But conversations around policing and criminal justice reform could shift how the voting public views cannabis as a political issue. "If cannabis reform gets folded into the larger conversation around racial justice and policing, that could create that policy window," Hudak suggested. "Where everything comes together at the right time and (then) something can get done. That makes it more salient to Americans. Because then Americans stop thinking about it as, 'Can you buy cannabis legally or not.' You're thinking about it as something systemic, something institutional, something that touches a lot of issues."
