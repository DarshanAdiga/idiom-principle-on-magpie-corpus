ECU: The good news was the Pirates made it to gameday for the first time this season. They were originally scheduled to host Marshall for their opener on Aug. 29, but that game was pushed back to Sept. 12 -- and then postponed again to a to-be-determined date after the Pirates had to pause football activities in August due to a coronavirus cluster. Beyond that, it was a rough start to Mike Houston's second season.

Barrett, 48, currently serves as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, which covers Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin, and is based in Chicago. President Trump nominated her to the bench in May 2017 and the Senate confirmed her on Oct. 31, 2017.


  She graduated from Notre Dame Law School in 1997, and clerked for Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia from 1998 to 1999. Like Scalia, Barrett has described her legal philosophy as originalist, meaning that she believes laws should be interpreted based on the perspectives of the people who wrote them at the time. Barrett has taught law at Notre Dame Law School since 2002.


  “A judge must apply the law as written,” Barrett said on Saturday. “Judges are not policy makers and they must be resolute in setting aside any policy views they might hold.”


  Barrett’s past legal opinions on business-related questions are few, but giving the Supreme Court a larger conservative majority would suggest a more business-friendly and anti-regulation tilt. Cases coming before the court in the term that begins Oct. 5 include a challenge to the Affordable Care Act’s “individual mandate” requiring all Americans to have health insurance.

PLYMOUTH - Two majors, two minors, two trips across the ocean, four years as a defensive stalwart on the women's hockey team and a cumulative grade point average of 3.84. When you add up all the numbers, you have to wonder how Torrie Gray did what she did in her four years at St. Michael's College.


  "I looked at it like I didn't want to miss anything about the entire college experience and wonder 'what if …'" later on down the line, the 22-year-old recent college graduate said. "I had to be really structured with my time and I got lots of help with my coaches and teachers to get all of it done. I knew I always had a mental health day in my back pocket if I needed some time to step away if I need it.


  "Nothing ever got to the point where I felt like I was over my head."


  Gray graduated from St. Michael's College with a double major in Business Administration and Global Studies and a minor in Philosophy as well as Peace and Justice. The heavy course load and playing a varsity sport did not stop her from starring in the classroom. She is a member of the Sigma Beta Delta International Honor Society as well as the Chi Alpha Sigma student-athlete honor society.


  Gray has jumped right into the working world after graduation as the media coordinator for the Joint Committee of Children's Healthcare in Everett.


  Hockey's been a part of Gray's life for as long as she can remember. She was around the rink taking skating lessons as a first-grader when her younger brother, Montgomery, was starting out with Plymouth Youth Hockey program. Soon enough she was lacing up her skates and on the ice playing hockey as well.


  "I think it's cool to be part of that first group of the girls hockey players in town," said Gray. "We were able to get the ball rolling for the girls hockey program in town, and I'm really glad to see there they have taken it so far."


  At St. Michael's College she was a captain of the team her senior year. The ultimate defensive defenseman, she had no goals and four assists in 86 career games, and she made her mark as a leader of the program.


  "The coach usually paired me with more of an offensive defenseman, so I knew my role was to make sure things were good on the back end," Gray said. "I miss being part of a hockey program every day. I loved the structure of having hockey there at the end of the day, no matter what else was going on."


  Gray was named an All-American Scholar by the American Hockey Coaches Association in three of her seasons at St. Michael's. The group honors more than 1,200 male and female Division I, II and III college hockey players each year. To make the list student-athletes needed to hold a minimum of a 3.75 GPA and have competed in at least 40 percent of their team's games.


  But college was much more than trips between the classroom and the hockey rink for Gray. She spent the summer after her sophomore year working in Guyana, and the summer between her junior and senior years Gray did an internship in Hong Kong.


  "Living in Guyana was eye-opening. The people there were so joyful," Gray said. "Everyone I met there had such a great view on life. People may not have had much, but they are incredibly appreciative of what they do have in their lives."


  A year after that trip Gray was on the road again, this time working to help create an investor deck for a company in Hong Kong.


  "There were some protests going on in the city at the time, but they were never really where I was staying," said Gray, who returned home about a week before the airport was closed because of the growing coronavirus pandemic. "I remember spending some free time watching pick-up soccer games, and the horse races were also popular in the city."


  The Far East made a lasting impact.


  "Hong Kong is a beautiful city. It's surrounded by mountains so it almost feels like you are in a bowl," Gray said. "I lived in a hotel in the city and the people that I met were all very friendly. I remember one time I was out getting some dumplings and it started pouring rain. Out of nowhere this lady I didn't know comes running over to share her umbrella with me."

Once they’ve committed, election judges go through between two to four hours of training on how the equipment works, how to register a new voter, along with different ways people can verify their identities and addresses.


  “The training was actually really helpful; they’ve done a pretty good job of making things as error proof as possible from an operations standpoint, and setting up the equipment,” Downey said.


  Head judges, or election judges with past experience, are responsible for the operations of each individual polling place and are also on hand to guide new volunteers.


  “Election judges each have roles,” said Jaci Kopet, public services manager for Nicollet County. “Somebody is checking them in on their roster, somebody is registering new voters, somebody is handing them their ballots and then somebody is at the end when they put their ballot in the ballot counter.”


  Kopet said four Nicollet County townships that had polling places in previous elections have chosen to send mail-in ballots to residents in response to the pandemic. Nicollet and Courtland have one polling place each.


  Barbara Luker, an elections official for the city of St. Peter, said there are about 1,800 registered voters for the city’s four precincts. She said the city has reached its goal of 72 election judges, and of those, 45 of those are volunteering in St. Peter for the first time.


  They will replace the roughly 50% of election judges who volunteered in March during the primaries but have since chosen not to volunteer in the August primaries or the general election.


  “We’ve actually stopped taking applications; and on Monday night, the remainder of them, about 40, will be appointed,” Luker said. “We’re good to go. In fact, we might have a bit more than we need.”


  The surplus of alternate judges will provide a buffer in case anyone has to pull out due to illness or if people get cold feet if the pandemic takes a turn for the worse this fall. She said the interest among volunteering stems by the number of younger people signing up.


  “During the presidential election year, we always have younger people who want to get involved,” Luker said. “We’re lucky because we have Gustavus and students are every active politically, so we have a source of election judges that a lot of communities don’t have.”


  Despite the overwhelming response, Stalberger is still encouraging anyone interested in volunteering in Mankato to apply. If only half of the 160 people who have signed up don’t complete their training, they will barely meet their goals for staffing those polling places.


  He’s encouraging potential judges who lean Republican or who are unaffiliated with a particular party to sign up to balance party affiliations in the polling places.


  “If we can add more judges in these categories, plus get our already-applied judges trained, we will be able to ensure a safe, fair, and efficient voting experience on Election Day,” he said.

I have consoled myself with the idea that I had hoped for a column of color, and I got it. The color is green.


  Speaking of green, my first season of using my greenhouse held a few surprises and provided a learning curve.


  I spread out the rug we had purchased when we bought our camper. Turns out those rugs kill grass in campgrounds, and therefore, are not allowed in most.


  Since the problem in campgrounds is grass killing, I thought it would be a good weed barrier in my greenhouse, and just about the right size, too. I thought I was pretty smart to have thought of it.


  During one of our torrential rains last summer, my greenhouse flooded. The rug got wet. The plants got moldy.


  Mostly just the fruits of the tomatoes molded, not the foliage. That cleanup job is a disgusting one. The rug came out as soon as I could get it out. It was not moldy. I guess it’s treated with something that I probably didn’t want in my greenhouse, anyway.


  I did have a few grass seeds germinate in the greenhouse that were easily pulled out. The only other volunteer I had growing in there was something that, after I pulled out, I realized was a beautiful celosia plant — also known as cockscomb.


  The very second I saw it, I grabbed it and yanked it out. After, as I looked at it and realized what it was, I felt almost immediate regret. The plant and its flower are beautiful. Still, I didn’t want it growing in the ground in my greenhouse.


  I have no idea where that seed came from. I haven’t grown celosia for years, so I haven’t had any known source of seeds.


  Because it was so pretty, I’m inspired to grow some on purpose next year. I’ll need to do some research to see if they like fertilizer before I do.

Forestry management practices like fire suppression have also reduced areas where whitebark pine can find an advantage over competing species. After a wildfire, whitebark pine is one of the first trees to take root. The open spaces created by natural fires in the subalpine are ideal for the sun- worshipping tree. Preventing or limiting natural fire events means there are fewer places where the tree is able to repopulate the landscape.

FREDERICKSBURG, VA. (AP) — A Virginia man accused of spray-painting property with graffiti while he was supposed to be performing community service for a vandalism conviction has been sentenced to three years in jail. The Free Lance-Star reports that 21-year-old Robert Singhass bragged on social media about spray-painting the word “Robbo” on properties in Fredericksburg earlier this year and drinking liquor when he was supposed to be picking up trash. Fredericksburg Circuit Court Judge Gordon Willis sentenced him on Friday to a total of 55 years in jail but suspended all but two of those years. He sentenced Singhass to a third year in jail for violating his probation for earlier vandalism convictions.
