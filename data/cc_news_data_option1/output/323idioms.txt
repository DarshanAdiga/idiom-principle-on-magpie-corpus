“Spags has done a great job with that group,” Reid said. “He has guys with him on the defensive side that he was familiar with. He'll be the first to tell you, that is such a big part of it. He didn't have to teach the coaches — the coaches just hit the ground running and already knew what was expected of them. So the players go, ‘Man, all these guys believe this, they can teach it, they’re all tied in.' With that, there was a confidence that was built in. Even when things start off slow, the guys are going, ‘We’re this close to turning things around again to the way we want it.' And they just keep at it.”

Oostzaan is a curious blend of true Amsterdammers, usually former dock workers and shipbuilders, and the 'locals' who are traditionally Zaanlanders (much like in Zaandam) – they have a, somewhat undeserved, reputation as being 'anti-social' and 'poor', but I'd argue they're more 'set in their ways' and 'hard-working labourers' if anything.
 Oostzaan is crowded and tiny, this goes for the majority of houses too, and there's literally no way to tell you're now in Oostzaan and then in Amsterdam- Noord – there's no border of any kind and the people freely move back and forth between both areas without any kind of reservations. The main difference is that Oostzaan is very 'tight' – you're part of their group or you aren't, joining them is not too hard as long as you adapt and are willing to look the other way here and there (the same goes for Amsterdam-Noord, I might add!) you will soon find yourself as being 'one of us' and it might bring you into the happiest times in your life. But mind you, this – is – a 'labourers' town, don't expect much cultural interest, much sympathy when going against the grain or any kind of luxuries – it is what it is and you're welcome to join but just accept them and the town as they are.

Eli and the Giants had a late kick against Atlanta, while Peyton and the Indianapolis Colts lashed the Chicago Bears in an early game. When Colts coach Tony Dungy dropped his front with a big lead in the fourth quarter, Peyton was frustrated to get out of the court and onto a television. He tried to order a car service from the sideline - while the Colts were still playing. He pulled a staff member aside and said, "I need to get to a TV restaurant." The staff could not find his car, so after the clock expired, while Dungy was still in the shower, Peyton occupied the police escort for the group bus.
