It's a two-horse race for the top spot in most mock drafts, with Martin and Spencer Torkelson each bringing something different to the table. We're giving Martin the edge based on his athleticism and the likelihood he winds up playing a premium position, inherently boosting his overall value down the road.

Most notably, some of the sport's biggest stars — like Dale Earnhardt Jr., Kyle Busch, Kevin Harvick and Jimmie Johnson — helped make a scripted video condemning racial inequality and encouraging people to listen and better educate themselves as the first step to help end injustice. In the generalized call to action, they said "the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery and countless others in the black community are heartbreaking and can no longer be ignored." Drivers shared the video on social media Sunday, and FOX included it in its pre-race broadcast, along with a statement from NASCAR president Steve Phelps.

Sometimes I feel like the word “bravery” is too strong a word to describe the act of writing memoir. After all, isn’t memoir just remembering how things happened, and then writing those things, and your interpretation of them, down on paper or on your laptop? It’s not like you’re going to get a writing medal for your bravery, or a commendation for courage. It’s not like you ran the rapids or scaled the sheer face of a cliff.

After his retirement from the Navy, Lally was hired as an assistant coach at San Diego State University. In his six seasons with the program, the Aztecs have qualified for the NCAA Tournament three times. Unfortunately, this season was cut short due to the coronavirus pandemic.
 “My path to San Diego State or Division I baseball is not how you do it,” Lally said. “It’s unbelievable. I tell my friends all the time how grateful I am every day to do this.”
 Lally began with San Diego State in 2015, but the job was first offered when Tony Gwynn was the head coach of the Aztecs.
 “I was coming up on my 20-year mark and getting ready — so I thought — to retire from the Navy,” Lally said. “Tony and Mark and all of those guys on staff asked if I would be interested to coach at San Diego State. That was a no-brainer for me. I put in my retirement from the Navy, and they said, no, we need you for a little while longer. I ended up staying in the Navy a couple of more years before they finally let me retire.”
 Lally assumed the job offer from San Diego State was gone after he left the Navy.
 “I had no big aspirations of San Diego State anymore because that was a couple of years ago,” Lally said. “I had an indoor facility that I’m part owner of in San Marcos, Calif. I was just going to do camps and help with travel teams there. My son was still young, 11-years old, when I retired. I was just going to do that.”
 That wasn’t the case. San Diego State asked Lally again almost immediately after he finished with the Navy if he would consider taking a coaching position with the Aztecs.
 “Mark (Martinez) got a hold of me and asked if I still wanted the job,” Lally said. “I just said, ‘Wow! Are you kidding?’ The rest is history after that. They welcomed me with open arms, giving me that opportunity. Coach Gwynn passed away that year, and Mark was named the head coach.”
 Martinez was aware of Lally from his work with the all-Navy and Military All- Star teams, but the two got to know each other once Martinez was hired in 2006 at San Diego State.
 “When Tony hired Mark, both of our sons — my son Nicholas and his son Cade — were the same age,” Lally said. “They were like 3 at the time and playing baseball together. He and I talked. I was telling him my baseball stories, and he was a Division I baseball coach, so I had my ears wide open listening to him. Our boys grew up and played everything — basketball, golf, soccer and obviously baseball. Our wives met and became great friends. We both have daughters. His daughter is older. She just graduated from St. Mary’s at Notre Dame. My daughter is turning 13 this month. We just turned into great family friends.”
 Lally serves as the director of player development and camp coordinator, but the job offers more than the title suggests.
 “Anything coach Martinez needs me to do, I do it,” Lally said. “If you know about how much it takes to make a winning baseball team, you just do whatever you need to do.”

For Ivan Hirst, this was the icing on the cake for his successful tenure. On October 8, 1949, the British Military Government transferred the trusteeship of Volkswagenwerk GmbH to the German government.

If nothing else, there's a good chance he'll become a solid regular with decent tools across the board.

OCEAN CITY -- With the resort's season now in full swing, the local area's representatives in Annapolis and state restaurant and hospitality leaders will gather on the Eastern Shore on Monday afternoon to make an impassioned plea to Governor Larry Hogan to ease restrictions and allow businesses to open more fully.
 Hogan last week announced the state was entering stage two of his Maryland Strong: Roadmap to Recovery plan, which allows for the reopening of most retail businesses, personal services businesses and many other industries. Conspicuously absent from Hogan's state two announcement was any mention of easing restrictions still in place for restaurants, amusements and other hospitality industries.
 As a result, most resort-area restaurants are still operating with outdoor seating where possible, modified outdoor seating arrangements and a carryout model, while others remain shuttered as the summer season approaches mid-June. Most are making it work the best they can, while others continue to see all- important summer revenue slipping away.
 As a result, the Restaurant Association of Maryland (RAM), along with a slew of Eastern Shore state senators and delegates and representatives of the regional hospitality industry will hold a press conference at the Fisherman's Inn in Grasonville on Monday afternoon to implore Hogan to ease the restrictions and allow restaurants to reopen and stop the fiscal bleeding.

Wearable tech isn't all about smartwatches and fitness bands. Let's not forget about our feet. The Smart Insole can help you avoid injury and even, in some cases, surgery.  
 It's made by UK-based bio-engineering firm HCi Viocare Technologies. Pop it inside your standard shoe or trainer, and its network of tiny electronic sensors will record data and send it to your smartphone or tablet, where it can be analysed. Don't fancy having it as a standalone device? It can also be built into your footwear.      It's aimed at those who want to keep tabs on the condition of their feet, such as diabetic patients or athletes.      As it monitors the pressures and strains on your feet, it can send warnings to your smartphone to take remedial action when required. For diabetes sufferers, it could even mean saving their feet. They often suffer from neuropathy, which causes a loss of sensation in the feet. This makes them more prone to foot ulcers, which could ultimately lead to amputation.      Runners will also benefit, as they can see how their running style impacts on their joints. Your gait causing you trouble? It will help you adapt for pain- free running. And you won't have to wait months for expensive analysis – just fire up your phone and have a look at the results.      Like other wearable devices, it can also determine your weight, balance, calories expended, cadence and distance traveled. Not only that, it can be used to select corrective insoles for problems like over-pronation, and tell you when your running shoes don't give you enough support anymore.      HCi Viocare Technologies is in talks concerning potential licensing agreements at the moment, so it might be a while before the Smart Insole goes on sale. It's expected to cost less than £200 and may be prescribed or reimbursed by healthcare providers to diabetic patients at risk of foot ulcers.

In its second season the Showtime program explores the excesses and greed of Wall Street in the wake of the Black Monday crash of 1987. Set in the 1980s, it allows the show to take comedic swings at social issues in a way that allows reflection on how far we have (or haven’t) come. Rannells explains, “In the first season we did this over the top sexual harassment seminar. As we read it, it was so funny and over the top. But when we were filming it, at the beginning of what would become the #metoo movement, we realized we have not come that far. A lot of people still don’t know how to behave in the workplace. This season they explore sexism with Regina Hall’s character specifically. We are not talking about that long ago. As those storylines come up, you wish we were further ahead.”
