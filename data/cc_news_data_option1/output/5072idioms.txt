Still, Miami's got plenty on the line starting with a potential home-town bowl game at the Orange Bowl to finish the season. Should Clemson win the rematch with Notre Dame in the ACC title game on Dec. 19, it would likely mean two ACC schools in College Football Playoff -- and clear the way for Miami to take the league's slot in the Orange Bowl, a lucrative and prestigious New Year's Six game.

India&amp;rsquo;s 2020 festive season has brought a cheer to the real estate industry with a much-needed boost for home sales, for products cutting across categories. Amidst all the positivity, there was a sobering reality of the downturn in the Indian economy, which had witnessed a steep fall and a liquidity crunch among consumers with a caution to spend. Although there are challenges of the pandemic that the country continues to face today and its impact on overall consumer sentiment, the festive season has restored the faith that real estate continues to be a preferred choice of long-term investment.With a substantial revival in consumer sentiment, the industry has witnessed an upward trend in sales across all cities. With an improved attractiveness for real estate as a preferred asset class, against other traditional alternatives, home buyers are looking at safeguarding their accumulated savings by investing in a more long-term asset.The festive season saw more than just green shootsThough the first quarter was owing to the lockdown and the economic slowdown, the third quarter led to a tremendous rebounding of sentiment among buyers that was held back in speculative times. Amid the onslaught of COVID-19, experts had speculated that this festive season would witnesses cautious and smarter buying than before. Nevertheless, real estate has bounced back in this festive season.According to the Confederation of Real Estate Developers' Association of India (CREDAI), there was an increase of 20-25 percent in sales this Diwali compared to the previous year. As a result, NCR witnessed an increase in sales by 38 percent QoQ, as compared to Q2 2020. &amp;nbsp;According to a report by JLL, in Gurugram alone, the housing sales saw a spur of Rs 1,371 crore in the third quarter of 2020 in comparison to the second quarter that saw sales worth Rs 467 crore.Festive offers are out there &amp;mdash; even if not all consumers are readyThe series of economic incentives provided by the government such as the slashing of repo rate and the reverse repo rate, an extension of the deadline for the completion of real estate projects, increase in allocation to Prime Minister Awaas Yojana, and income tax relief played a vital role in boosting consumer sentiment. These measures, coupled with low-interest rates and high- value proportions in the form of flexible or staggered payment options, construction allowance, and enticing value-added offers attracted buyers. &amp;nbsp;As the festive season began in the thick of the pandemic, consumers lapped up the opportunity to invest in projects available with a range of offers and incentives by developers.The economic uncertainty, coupled with diminishing prospects in alternative asset classes, has given a fillip to the trend of real estate investment. &amp;nbsp;The COVID-19 has also led to NRIs eyeing investment in the homeland amid a sense of security. Real estate has emerged as a viable option owing to its relative safety and an assurance of stable and regular returns.What&amp;rsquo;s next for the sector?The consolidation of the market is expected in favour of organised players. The COVID-19 pandemic has invariably renewed focus on developers with sound financial credentials that are expected to percolate further. The extensive leveraging of emerging technologies such as Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality will be the norm. This trend has begun to take shape since the lockdown. The 'walk to work concept,' preference for gated townships, and an opulent lifestyle will fuel the growth of luxury housing.A moderate price increase of around 2 percent is expected in the prime residential market in 2021. The concept of 'staycation' and workcation' will fuel the demand for weekend homes. Amid health, hygiene and wellness concerns, there would be an increased emphasis on robust facility management in residential and commercial offerings. As consumers evaluate purchases from a much more realistic angle, consumer-centricity and best-in-class services will be the key to a widening consumer base.Riding on the wave of infrastructural developments, conducive policy landscape and initiatives by developers, real estate is poised to emerge strongly in the post-COVID-19 scenario.&amp;mdash;The author Karan Kumar is Chief Marketing Officer, DLF Ltd.

But Joe’s willingness to go against the grain and ask tough questions was invaluable — and it would continue to be a trait I relied on throughout my eight years. Because one of the risks of soliciting views from a large group is that a current of thinking can quickly take shape and move everybody in the same direction. Having at least one contrarian in the room pushed us all to think harder — and, frankly, everyone was a bit freer with their opinions when that contrarian wasn’t me.

This means that any investor that wants to get out, absolutely can for 100% of NAV, whatever NAV might be at that time. At the termination date, there is a good chance that the fund will trade close or at NAV anyway. This happens because shareholders bid it up to participate in the tender offer, and for 100%, that is the best tender offer you can get.
 The only stipulation for the fund to continue to exist is that after the tender there is still a minimum of $200 million in assets to manage. In my mind, that won't be too hard to achieve either since they launched with $1.25 billion. They will either have to do a terrible job and see the value of the fund drop massively or shareholders will have to be awake during tender offer time.
 As we know, that isn't always the case. Western Asset Global High Income Fund (EHI) and Western Asset High Income Fund II Inc (HIX) recently finished off tender offers where the funds accepted 100% of shares tendered. Even though EHI's offer was for 50% of shares and HIX's offer was for 35%. This happened because fewer shares were offered for tender than up to their maximum.
 ## What Exactly Will They Invest In?
 They mention that "under normal conditions, the Fund invests at least 80% of its managed assets in a portfolio of preferred and other income securities issued by U.S. and non-U.S. companies, which may be either exchange-traded or available OTC."
 This does mean that they are quite free to invest how they seem fit, wherever they see the best opportunity. The securities types also allow them to be quite flexible. They list "Traditional preferred securities, hybrid preferred securities that have investment and economic characteristics of both preferred stock and debt securities, floating rate and fixed to floating rate preferred, fixed and floating rate corporate debt, CoCos, convertible securities and securities of other CEFs, OEFs or ETFs that invest primarily in preferred and/or income securities"
 A "CoCo" is a contingent convertible bond. This basically means that the convertible bond has a certain trigger and then will convert. However, instead of just a certain price the common equity has to hit, there can be greater stipulations. The other investments are pretty standard that most investors will understand and have a grasp on the basic ideas of the security being invested in. As mentioned above, they aren't blazing any new trails with this fund - just your standard preferred and income fund.

Scientists may have solved one of paleontology's enduring mysteries - the evolutionary origins of the flying reptiles called pterosaurs that ruled the skies at the same time that dinosaurs dominated the land.Researchers said on Wednesday a poorly understood Triassic Period reptile group called lagerpetids, known from a few partial skeletons from the United States, Argentina, Brazil and Madagascar, appears to have been the evolutionary precursor to pterosaurs. Lagerpetids, first appearing about 237 million years ago, were generally small and may have been bipedal insect- eaters. They could not fly. Pterosaurs became Earth's first flying vertebrates, with birds and then bats appearing much later. "The origin of pterosaurs has been one of the most enigmatic issues of paleontology since the first discovery of pterosaurs in the late 18th century," said paleontologist Martin Ezcurra of the Argentine Museum of Natural Sciences in Buenos Aires, lead author of the study published in the journal Nature.The oldest-known pterosaurs appear in the fossil record about 220 million years ago, with anatomies fully developed for flight including wings formed by a membrane extending from the ankles to an exceptionally elongated fourth finger. Studying previously discovered and newly unearthed fossils using sophisticated scanning technology and three-dimensional modeling, the researchers identified at least 33 skeletal traits suggesting an evolutionary link between lagerpetids and pterosaurs. These included the shape of the inner ear, braincase and teeth, as well as similarities in hand, leg, ankle and pelvic bones."We show that lagerpetids are the closest-known relatives to pterosaurs and bridge the anatomical gap between pterosaurs and other reptiles," Ezcurra added.Lagerpetids also appear to be closely related to dinosaurs, the researchers said. The oldest-known dinosaur dates to about 233 million years ago. Pterosaurs disappeared 66 million years ago in the asteroid collision that also doomed the dinosaurs.While starting relatively small, pterosaurs eventually achieved huge dimensions, with wingspans reaching 35 feet (10.7 meters). "We have been studying how birds transformed their bodies for flight for the last 50 years and most of this was driven by extraordinary fossils of dinosaurs and early birds," Virginia Tech paleontologist and study co-author Sterling Nesbitt said. "Pterosaurs have not experienced this renaissance of understanding yet because we didn't have the fossils."(This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.)Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter

A green light for a Covid-19 vaccine could come any day now in the US, but leading health experts warn the nation is only at the start of a winter that's projected to be one of the most difficult in the nation's history.
 "We are in a totally unprecedented health crisis in this country. The disease is everywhere -- Midwest, West Coast, East Coast, North, South. Health care workers are exhausted, hospitals are totally full," former Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told CNN Wednesday night.
 December has already proved devastating. Wednesday recorded more than 3,100 Covid-19 deaths -- the highest daily death toll ever since the pandemic's start, beating a record set just days ago. There are now more than 106,600 Covid-19 patients nationwide, the most ever, according to the COVID Tracking Project. And the country's average of daily new cases is now more than 200,000 -- and that's as experts are soon expecting another surge to kick off, one fueled by the Thanksgiving travel and gatherings that took place last month.

Personal tuition has proved invaluable in this last year. For those able to afford private tuition at home, or tuition in tandem with online teaching, it has been a crucial constant in the ever-changing and highly disrupted form of mainstream schooling. The NTP was developed as an initiative that would help pupils who wouldn't ordinarily be able to access personal tuition, to do so. The quality of that tuition and its methods for implementing it remains to be seen, but overextending the funding and rushing out a relatively unregulated programme, seems like a sure-fire way to deliver a subpar service - particularly one that hasn't even been comprehensively outlined, verified, or rigorously tested.

"Grey's Anatomy" season 17 is not the final run of the long-running ABC show according to Chandra Wilson, who said they want to end the series with good and happy memories instead of it being about COVID-19.
 Wilson, who plays Dr. Miranda Bailey, believes that it is not a good way to end the series with the central hero, Meredith Gray, in a hospital bed in and out of consciousness as she fights for her life against the disease. It would only leave a dark imprint on the show.
 "Especially in light of what's happening right now, it's like, do we want the last season to be about COVID? Or do we want us to be able to put some nice ribbons around it with rainbows and balloons and things?" she said in an interview with ET correspondent Katie Krause.
 Wilson acknowledged that there have been questions on whether "Grey's Anatomy" season 17 is the final run. Patrick Dempsey reprised his long-dead character Derek Shepherd to reunite with his on-screen wife, Meredith while she was in a dreamlike state.
 The appearance of another dead character made Meredith think that she will soon head over to the Silver City to reunite with Derek. She met T.R. Knight's George O'Malley, who died in season 5, during another COVID-19- induced unconscious state.
 Wilson said she knows "from a creative standpoint" that there have been questions on how the season will end. But she pointed out that these conversations do not end up happening at all because of several reasons.
 "Because the network's not ready, the studio's not ready, the fanbase isn't ready, the numbers are too good, all of those things," she explained adding, "Collectively, they've decided we're not going to put an end on it. We're just going to wait and see."
 Why advertise with us
 Wilson said that on the creative end, conversations have come up. But for the cast of "Grey's Anatomy" season 17, they are ready for whatever needs to be done for the story. They are ready to bring to life "whatever life you see for these characters." They are willing to move on to another chapter that does not involve COVID-19.

The UK-based Cotton Outlook has further cut its estimate for global output in 2020-21 (Aug-Jul) to 24.2 mln tn from 24.4 mln tn projected in October, the agency said in its November report. Indian traders have signed deals to export around 100,000 tn of maize to Bangladesh, market participants said. The traders are likely to export the maize at $190-$200 per tn, free on board, they said. Farmers' unions have turned down the government's 20-page draft proposal focusing on amendment of the new farm laws, insisting on their rollback. Madhya Pradesh has so far procured 727,115 tn of key kharif crops--- jowar, bajra, and paddy--harvested in 2020-21 (Jul-Jun) under the price support scheme, an official with the state department said. Adamant on their demand for rollback of the three new farm laws, farmers refused to consider a proposal of amendment offered by Home Minister Amit Shah at a late night meeting on Tuesday. India's soymeal exports in November jumped nearly 144% on year to 200,000 tn, data from The Soybean Processors Association of India showed. With the government reluctant to withdraw the new three farm laws, farmers have decided to intensify their protests across the country and have called for a nationwide 'dharna' on Monday. government has so far bought 35.6 mln tn of paddy from farmers in the 2020-21 (Oct-Sep) kharif marketing season, up 20.4% on year, according to an official release. Paddy is the largest grown crop in the kharif season.

Apart from the likes of the Ford Mustang, the Raptor has long been a long- standing flagship of the brand. It’s ability to be driven as the crow flies is central to its appeal, as is its impressive towing capacity and impressive torque figures. It’s this heady concoction of utility mixed with desirability and unbridled machismo, that can make the Ranger Raptor.
 Mind you, the Ranger Raptor is different from the even more red blooded F-150 Raptor. But that doesn’t make it a featherweight.
 The India-bound Ranger Raptor (the Raptor suffix is added to Ford’s performance-enhanced SUVs,) which shares its underpinnings with the Ford Endeavour may be powered by the same agricultural 2.0-litre turbo-petrol putting out 213bhp and 500Nm of torque, but it’s got the ground clearance and the mechanical chops to be the Baja-style buggy from hell, that you’ve always wanted and needed to waft over Indian terrain.

Right from the blow of the whistle, Brandon Fernandes started pulling the strings in the midfield for the Gaurs. Within the first 10 minutes, a beautifully-threaded pass found its way to Jorge Ortiz, who hit the cross-bar. The second was another superb through-ball to Igor Angulo, who struck the left side of the post. Brandon was already having an impact on the game.
 The 26-year-old got yet another assist to his name later. His aerial pass found Jorge Ortiz, who calmly slotted the ball into the net to give FC Goa a 2-0 advantage. This was Brandon's final contribution to the game as he was replaced by Princeton Rebello.
 After that game, Brandon Fernandes started getting comparisons with Manchester United's Bruno Fernandes. While both players have the same initials, the extra dimension they bring to their respective teams is unparalleled. Bruno Fernandes is the heartbeat of the Manchester United attack, and Brandon is now beginning to strike a dangerous partnership with Igor Angulo and Jorge Ortiz.
 It might seem presumptuous at the moment, but the way FC Goa are playing, they might very well be contenders for the title alongside the likes of ATK Mohun Bagan and Bengaluru FC. And the way things are going, Brandon Fernandes is expected to leapfrog Hugo Boumous as the assists leader in the games to come.

First, he headed off to Liverpool University to study biochemistry and could be found in the labs once again, tinkering around. “I was lucky because there were lecturers there who let you go in and experiment, just try things out.” He recalls trying to find a solution to the fact most people hadn’t finished all their practical work. “We thought if we could just scale up our experiments, I could share some of my sample, and they could share some of theirs.” It didn’t go entirely to plan. “You find out with some of the more reactive elements, it’s not a good idea to scale them up! We certainly had a number of pieces of equipment that didn’t survive.” Behind what can seem a serious face at first, Phoenix’s eyes are definitely twinkling.

"While the earlier plan was to hit this target by March, COVID has disrupted the plan and it should happen towards the second half of 2021," one of the sources said.
 The move comes amid the government's push for electric vehicles (EVs), growth of support infrastructure and the expected cost benefits in the long run.
 Two-wheelers account for 70 percent of the 253 million vehicles on India’s roads, according to JMK Research, a consulting firm with a focus on renewable energy and EVs. There is no data on how many of these are used for commercial purposes but it is known that two-wheelers account for more than 20 percent of the total carbon dioxide emissions in urban areas.

To get everybody on the same page, I called a meeting with my economic team. We spent a long, exhausting day hearing from Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner about how the stress tests were going, hashing out various alternatives, and pushing every idea to its logical conclusion to see if it might work. By evening, I left the meeting to have dinner and get a haircut and told my team that I expected a consensus upon my return. But the truth was that, through that grueling process, I had already reached my decision to let the stress tests bear out. Within six months, the economy would start growing again. And by the next year, the biggest banks had paid back every dime of taxpayer money — plus interest.

How this happened was more circumstantial because I was not getting to make my desired first film and I adapted myself. I think in that process what did happen, was it took me back to where I came from, the gullies I came from,&quot; he added.

Bloomberg) -- BASF SE is exploring the sale of some U.S. chemicals assets that could fetch around $400 million, as Chief Executive Officer Martin Brudermueller seeks to streamline the company’s portfolio, people familiar with the matter said.
 The world’s largest chemical producer is considering the divestment of a surfactants plant in Kankakee, Illinois, that could be valued at about $250 million, according to the people, who asked not to be identified as the plans are private.
 BASF is also working with an adviser to gauge interest in a kaolin business in the southern U.S. state of Georgia, the people said. Those operations could fetch at least $150 million, the people said.
 Deliberations are ongoing, and no final decisions have been made on the potential disposals, according to the people. A representative for BASF declined to comment.
 Under Brudermueller, BASF has been streamlining its operations. In late 2019, it agreed to sell its construction chemicals business to private equity firm Lone Star Funds for 3.2 billion euros.
 BASF has also been preparing a potential stock market listing for Wintershall Dea GmbH, its oil and gas venture with billionaire Mikhail Fridman. Brudermueller said on an Oct. 28 conference call that only some smaller units are left to be divested under its current plan, and BASF has “no urgent need” to rush ahead.
 Any proceeds from asset sales in the U.S. would raise funds for BASF at a time when the coronavirus pandemic is hurting demand. BASF reported a net loss of 2.1 billion euros ($2.6 billion) in the third quarter due to heavy writedowns linked to the aviation and automobile industries.
 The company’s shares have fallen about 5% this year, giving it a market value of 58.7 billion euros.
