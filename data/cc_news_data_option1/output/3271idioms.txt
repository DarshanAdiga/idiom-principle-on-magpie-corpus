During his second season, Baker noticed a lump on his shoulder during preseason, but he didn’t have it checked, for fear of being cut from the team.
 Later that year, Baker took a hit from Jacksonville’s Justin Durant in a game against the Jaguars that put him out for a while.
 He came back after four weeks, but wasn’t the same as the Steelers earned a Super Bowl title.
 Following the Super Bowl win, Baker went to get an MRI for his injured shoulder.
 He went in expecting to hear he’d have to have surgery.
 What he heard was far more scary.
 “I go in thinking I was going to have to have surgery, but that’s when the doctor told me, ‘We ran tests and we’re 97 percent sure you have cancer.’”
 Thinking his life would change drastically and his football career was over, Baker consulted with others on what to expect with the potential cancer diagnosis, and doctors told him to return two weeks before surgery for more tests.
 Instead, the tests revealed that Baker’s prayers had been answered.
 “The doctor said, ‘Boy, are you lucky. That 3 percent was stronger than that 97 percent,’” Baker said. “I remember just smiling and saying, ‘I’m not lucky. I’m blessed.’”
 Baker is using that situation as a testimony for Broc and Cade Thompson to stay positive and keep the faith.
 With the help of Scarcelle, they are letting the Thompson family know one important message that Baker has also expanded into a Twitter hashtag for all who are struggling mentally.
 That message? #YouAreNotAlone.

HUNTINGTON — Marshall’s wide receiver group is led by Dallas Baker, a coach who preaches family within his room.
 Recently, that family was shaken to its core when Marshall sophomore wide receiver Broc Thompson found out his 15-year-old brother, Cade, was diagnosed with cancer.
 As Baker pointed out to his players, being part of the Marshall family means players go through battles together.
 So when word came that Cade Thompson was starting to lose his hair during chemotherapy, Baker wanted to do something to show that his thoughts were with the Thompson family during the difficult time.
 For Baker and Marshall junior wide receiver Stone Scarcelle, Cade Thompson’s diagnosis hit on a real level, so they decided to shave their heads in solidarity with Cade’s battle.
 “It was very important, but it wasn’t hard,” Baker said of the gesture. “From the moment I got the job here, I always told my receivers that it’s bigger than football.”
 For Scarcelle, the bond with Broc Thompson was built quickly with Scarcelle being one of the older players who took Thompson under his wing upon arrival in Huntington, so he wanted to support his teammate.
 However, Cade Thompson’s diagnosis also hit Scarcelle on another level.
 “From day one, I’ve seen a lot of similarities between me and (Broc) — our energy, our work ethic, his personality is the same, we both have younger brothers that are around the same age,” Scarcelle said. “When I heard about it, it really hit home and I just put myself in his shoes.
 “I started thinking about how upset I would be and what I would do. I just felt we need to support him in every way possible — especially him being my teammate and brother.”
 Baker choked up and had to pause a minute when speaking about Scarcelle and the leadership that he has shown within the wide receivers room — both from a football and personal standpoint.
 “From the first day, just his attitude in the room — paying attention when I was talking and I could see he was taking down notes,” Baker said. “From that moment, we were just drawn to each other, and I tell him all the time, ‘Look, Stone, it’s me and you. I don’t care what else happens, I’ll have your back all the time.’”
 For Baker, Cade Thompson’s situation also hit on a personal level. Not only is Baker a father, but he also went through a similar situation while playing in the NFL for the Pittsburgh Steelers.

It said the EC, as a matter of urgency, should validate the voters’ register and expunge names of unqualified persons including foreign nationals and minors to ensure the integrity of the Register.      The statement said once the Voters’ Register was completed all stakeholders, particularly the political parties, were encouraged to put the past behind them and collaborate with the EC to conduct a transparent and fair elections.      It urged the Commission to sustain the “Let the Citizen Know” briefings to increase citizen’s access to information on the processes leading to the polls to ensure transparency.

Saxe will meet with the board again at 5 p.m. Aug. 25 to discuss and potentially approve a changed plan.
 The district will also work in the days leading up to the meeting to ensure the new guidelines are in line with guidance from the local health department.
 “We have the flexibility at our school district to be able to make some changes, so I would like to be able to further vet that and bring that information back to the board,” Saxe said.
 People stood outside the county’s central office during the meeting in protest of the color-coded system, and concerned parents and staff voiced their concerns during the delegations portion of the evening.
 “We used to have a Phase 2, and it’s gone,” Grace Gooding, a Cabell County substitute teacher, said. “There are too many bodies in the classroom. When you add in airborne spread, it’s just getting worse and worse. Everyone thought we wouldn’t go back until it’s safe because we had this Phase 2, then Friday happened.”
 Vera Miller, president of the Cabell County Education Association, said the district has the opportunity to make the safest decision for the county’s teachers and students despite the release of state guidelines.
 “Everyone in here has worked tirelessly, and their heart is in the right place, but when you make projection, you’re really just making a hypothesis,” Miller said. “Let them play politics. Let’s do the right thing here. Let’s take care of our children, and let’s do the right thing.”

Indian industry, if encouraged to grow, will generate larger turnovers that will enable higher taxes to go into the government’s coffers. This new commercial cadre would ensure this and also look after our external commercial interests, realising fully well that our foreign policy and our military posture are dictated by our internal economic base and also our overseas economic interests. As one example, it is not out of place to say, the fiasco at Chabahar was certainly avoidable if we had had a commercial service dedicated to looking after India’s economic interests. The Chabahar issue shows that diplomacy has its limitations as it is not geared to look into the economic angle. Our diplomats had done their job by balancing our international relations with Iran, inspite of the protestations of the United States, especially since the Iranian partner in the railway project was a company owned by the Republican Guards. But, at the end of the day, the Chabahar project was also a matter of money given the example of Sri Lanka and other African countries that have buckled in the face of massive Chinese lucre.

Joe Biden reminded the world what grace looks like.
 Robert Trump, President Trump’s younger brother, died Saturday. In response, Biden tweeted:“Mr. President, Jill and I are sad to learn of your younger brother Robert’s passing. I know the tremendous pain of losing a loved one – and I know how important family is in moments like these. I hope you know that our prayers are with you all.”
 Biden’s grace reminds us that despite how heated political rhetoric can be, we’re all human in the end – and when tragedy and death occur, we must set our differences aside and celebrate our common humanity. We must demonstrate our empathy.
 Regrettably, empathy is on the decline for many.
 Just minutes after Robert Trump’s death, some Donald Trump opponents showed the opposite of compassion by tweeting that “the wrong Trump died.”
 “Almost immediately after news of his death was released, tweets calling for the U.S. President’s death were posted using the hashtag #wrongtrump, which quickly became the number four trending topic on Twitter,” according to newspaper reports.
 Such class.
 Politics tends to bring out the worst in us. President Trump, no stranger to vitriolic tweets, brings out the worst in a lot of people.
 But empathy’s decline preceded Trump’s presidency. It’s been declining for years.
 Helen Riess, author of “The Empathy Effect,” says empathy’s decline has to do with social media.
 A Street Roots report on her book says “many of the neurological keys to feeling empathy are missing from the exchange” when we communicate through texts, email and social media posts. Communicating electronically, not face to face, there’s no eye contact, and no paying attention to body language and facial expressions.
 Without such visual emotional cues, Riess says, we’re left with words on a screen, leading to detachment, emotional indifference – and, we are all noticing more, some very nasty tweets.“Interviews with internet trolls are shocking in that they reveal these online agitators don’t tend to view their victims as real people,” she writes.
 An increasing number of people treat those they disagree with this way – which contributes to the decline of the civil discourse our country needs to address sizable problems.
 Luckily, I live in Pittsburgh, where empathy is common. We hold doors open for strangers, wave other motorists in front of us, and stop our cars to help with roadside breakdowns.
 But even in Pittsburgh, like the rest of the country, some people are getting ruder and meaner as online empathy wanes.
 Viewing political opponents as inhuman, even evil, you may feel you have license to shout at – or even assault – them.
 Aren’t we seeing more news stories about people assaulted for wearing the “wrong” baseball cap or supporting the “wrong” political idea?
 Though Riess says empathy is being blunted, she emphasizes to that it can be learned. That takes a conscious effort. We need to get out from behind our electronic devices and engage in person (harder in the covid-19 era, but important). We need to set politics aside now and then to celebrate our common humanity.
 Just as Joe Biden did with his classy tweet to President Trump.

Reggie Whibley A fisherman, surveyor, hunter, businessman and master craftsman , Reggie Whibley was born in 1944 in Ventura to Morris and Opel Whibley. Reg was blessed with many talents and exceptional charisma that allowed him to live life on his own terms. As a result he lived large and truly free. Reg was introduced to our beautiful Central Coast when his father brought him fishing to Morro Bay in the fifties. After graduating from Ventura College and serving two years in an Army MASH unit, he attended Cal Poly and majored in Industrial Arts. After graduating in 1970, he then became a teacher at Morro Bay high school, sharing his talent of wood shop and art. While living on the Embarcadero he, along with two partners, started a marine salvage and construction business called Associated Divers which later became Associated Pacific. Reggie was very successful in developing the business and constructing major projects up and down the Pacific Coast. He dropped the first moorings in Morro Bay harbor and was instrumental in the overall development of the marina, including the start of the Bayside Cafe. He and his partners constructed the headquarters and office of Associated Pacific on the Embarcadero in 1972 and later became the sole owner of the business. After a very rewarding career, he sold the business and retired in 2005. While he enjoyed building a successful business from scratch, he was a true craftsman when it came to woodworking. He could reclaim, repurpose, and revive anything. But his real skill was living life to the fullest. It was in retirement that Reggie got his money's worth. He loved the land and the ocean and was an advocate for both. He loved fishing on his boat or hunting on his property in Monterey County. He was a major sponsor of the Black Brandt Group and was selected as their "Sportsman of the Year". He collected vintage automobiles from the fifties and regularly met with the "Rock car group" on Saturday mornings. He built beautiful tables, cabinets and furniture for his many friends and carved elaborate gunstocks for his beautiful side by sides. But his masterpiece was the "treehouse" in the Lopez Lake area that he designed and furnished with his wife Judy. Reggie passed away on Sunday, August 9th. He was a fixture on the Embarcadero. With a glass of Jim Beam in hand, his loving wife Judy and cat Tony by his side, he always had a tale to tell about his many adventures throughout the world, and his escapades in Morro Bay. Reggie was a true "renaissance man" and "man's man" with some appeal to the ladies as well. A craftsman, designer, diver, instigator and true original, he will be sorely missed by those who were fortunate enough to have crossed his path.

George Scott Yeargin, Jr. of Pasadena, Texas died at age 63, a few days short of his 64th birthday. He was a gentle soul, an artist who received a fine art degree from Texas A & M University in Commerce, Texas. His art appeared on the cover of several magazines during the 1980's. He was also a truck driver for several years and received additional education from the American highway, an eye opening and white knuckled experience for him while making deliveries to various cities during the cold winters up north. He received a drafting degree from San Jacinto College and worked for various companies throughout the ship channel for a while. He received peace from cooking for his many friends and family. He was a lifelong gardener, who if he had it to do over again would most likely have pursued the title of Master Gardener. He was elated to serve as a Deacon at the First Presbyterian Church in Pasadena, Texas, having attended the same church since he was 4 years old. Other notable events throughout his life include that he learned to walk at the age of 8 months, much to the surprise of his family, who lived in Memphis Tennessee at this time. He hit the road walking and searching at the age of 3 or 4, outside of Crossett Arkansas, but was apprehended by a concerned citizen and thankfully returned to his mother. He attended Bailey Elementary, Park View Intermediate, and Sam Rayburn High School, graduating in 1974. He was a rabid baseball fan, with a card collection that spanned the decades. He joined the United States Navy and served aboard the USS Turner Joy, and was honorably discharged. He leaves behind the love of his life, Cindy Lamb. He leaves behind one sister and a brother in law, a niece and her family and two nephews and their families, and numerous cousins and kin folk who he loved beyond measure. He is preceded in death by his mother, Frances Laura Yeargin, and his father, George Scott Yeargin. A memorial service will take place on Saturday, August 22, 2020 at 2:00pm at Grand View Funeral Home

Stores would then need to train all of their cashiers to accept these expired coupons each time one of them beeped and was disallowed by the register. This, too, would be a Herculean task. I am reminded of a policy at one of my local supermarkets, which accepts two manufacturer coupons on a “Buy One, Get One Free” sale. Even though this has been the chain’s policy for over a decade, I still encounter cashiers who refuse to allow a second coupon when two items are being purchased! I end up pulling up the store’s website on my phone and showing the cashier the portion of the store’s coupon policy before he or she will allow the second coupon.
 Can you imagine the confusion and delays that would ensue at stores all over the country if shoppers all suddenly began insisting the stores accept expired coupons, while the cashiers pushed back, insisting that because the register rejects the expired coupon, the shoppers are wrong?
 I believe that most of us missed out on using many coupons during the peak of the pandemic, but as things continue to relax and inch toward returning to normal, we’ll be able to resume our in-person paper couponing habits.
 Another upside: Manufacturers’ advertising budgets include their coupon promotions. With far fewer redemptions during the COVID-19 pandemic than we would have seen in an average year, I suspect that we can look forward to additional coupon promotions from our favorite brands as shopping habits normalize. For example, if a brand did not have to redeem anywhere near the number of coupons that it anticipated for a campaign, it might use that money to fund a future campaign — perhaps with even higher-value coupons.
 With more people returning to stores to shop in person, brands will once again be competing with each other to increase the likelihood that their products end up in your shopping cart — and coupons are an important part of their strategies.

HUNTINGTON — An Ona man who admitted he took nearly $500,000 from a church where he had volunteered was sentenced Monday to serve federal prison time.
 Robert Dale Adkins, 76, of Ona, was sentenced to serve two years and nine months in federal prison after previously having pleaded guilty to mail fraud. He was also ordered to pay restitution of $487,488.92.
 Adkins admitted he had embezzled approximately $487,488.92 from Antioch Baptist Church in Ona.
 According to the charge against him, from 2012 to the end of 2018, Adkins wrote checks from a City National Bank checking account belonging to the church to his personal creditors without the church congregation’s knowledge. Adkins worked as a volunteer treasurer for the church and was not entitled to a salary or payment for his services to the church at the time. He did, however, have access to the church’s checkbook and financial records through his position, according to federal prosecutors.
 Specifically, the mail fraud charge stems from the defendant allegedly mailing a church check in December 2018 to a Texas creditor to pay his monthly vehicle payment on a 2016 Ford Escape.
 Adkins’ plea was delayed several times due to COVID-19 and for him to get his affairs in order. Court documents showed Adkins had been involved in a bankruptcy case and another case in the court. He had been working with probation officers to provide the court with a clear understanding of his financial situation, which had been complicated with the bankruptcy case.
 Part of that financial situation involves changing the beneficiary on at least one life insurance policy to the victim in the case to help pay restitution.
 The West Virginia State Police and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service conducted the investigation. U.S. District Judge Robert C. Chambers imposed the sentence. Assistant U.S. Attorney Greg McVey handled the prosecution, and Conner Robertson represented Adkins.

While living on the Embarcadero he, along with two partners, started a marine salvage and construction business called Associated Divers which later became Associated Pacific. Reggie was very successful in developing the business and constructing major projects up and down the Pacific Coast. He dropped the first moorings in Morro Bay harbor and was instrumental in the overall development of the marina, including the start of the Bayside Cafe. He and his partners constructed the headquarters and office of Associated Pacific on the Embarcadero in 1972 and later became the sole owner of the business. After a very rewarding career, he sold the business and retired in 2005. While he enjoyed building a successful business from scratch, he was a true craftsman when it came to woodworking. He could reclaim, repurpose, and revive anything. But his real skill was living life to the fullest. It was in retirement that Reggie got his money's worth. He loved the land and the ocean and was an advocate for both. He loved fishing on his boat or hunting on his property in Monterey County. He was a major sponsor of the Black Brandt Group and was selected as their "Sportsman of the Year". He collected vintage automobiles from the fifties and regularly met with the "Rock car group" on Saturday mornings. He built beautiful tables, cabinets and furniture for his many friends and carved elaborate gunstocks for his beautiful side by sides. But his masterpiece was the "treehouse" in the Lopez Lake area that he designed and furnished with his wife Judy. Reggie passed away on Sunday, August 9th. He was a fixture on the Embarcadero. With a glass of Jim Beam in hand, his loving wife Judy and cat Tony by his side, he always had a tale to tell about his many adventures throughout the world, and his escapades in Morro Bay. Reggie was a true "renaissance man" and "man's man" with some appeal to the ladies as well. A craftsman, designer, diver, instigator and true original, he will be sorely missed by those who were fortunate enough to have crossed his path.

Mary Ann Vaughn  
 QUITMAN — Mary Ann Vaughn was born in Myrtle Springs, Texas on August 28, 1944 to Glen Worth Sr. and Reba Arlou (Burns) Stovall and passed from this life the morning of August 14, 2020 at her home in Quitman, Texas from the complications of Alzheimer’s disease. Mary Ann lived in several areas of East Texas since her father was a Baptist minister. She started to school in Myrtle Springs and then attended school in Jacksonville twice, New Salem, and Judson Grove near Longview. She finished as Valedictorian of the 1962 graduating class of New Summerfield High school in New Summerfield, Texas. She then attended Tyler Junior College and graduated with an Associate’s degree in business. She went to work for Massey and Brown Sporting Goods in Tyler in 1964 and worked there for seven years. At the onset of Tyler State College, now University of Texas at Tyler, she became the secretary of the Dean of Admissions and Records. March 12, 1971 she was married to Donald Vaughn and a readymade family of two children at First Baptist Church in Grand Saline where her father was Pastor. She would not attend Jacksonville College because she did not want to marry a preacher and she did not marry a preacher but, to show that God has a sense of humor, her husband surrendered to the ministry in 1973 and accepted the Pastorate of Calvary Baptist Church in Golden, Texas where they moved in 1974. Mary Ann worked as a substitute teacher for Quitman schools for awhile and then started her own day care where she kept many kids that she considered her own. When her youngest child started to school, she went to work for Wood County in the Tax Assessor-Collector’s office where she made many lifelong friends and retired as Supervisor of the Automobile registration section after nineteen years service. She enjoyed her family, friends, reading, cooking, RVing and traveling. She was a very faithful pastor’s wife and was a member of Mt. Pisgah Baptist Church of Mineola, Texas at the time of her death.   She was preceded in death by her parents; Rev. Glen and Reba Stovall, an infant sister Gail Stovall, and older brother Glen Worth   Stovall Jr.   She is survived by her husband Donald Roy “Don” Vaughn of Quitman, TX, daughter Traci Dawn Thompson of Daingerfield, TX, sons, Randall Lyn Vaughn I (Dawn) of Bivins, TX, Glen Ervin Vaughn (Karen) of Buena Vista, Colorado, sister DeAnn Sellers of West Plains, Missouri, sister-in-law Mary Stovall of Whitehouse, TX.

Sao Paulo, Brazil, August 01, 2020 --(PR.com)-- B2Brazil Serviços Interativos Ltda. (B2Brazil) and Confederaçao da Agricultura e Pecuaria do Brasil - CNA (translated to the Confederation of Agriculture and Livestock of Brazil) signed an agreement for the development of the Marketplace CNA, an online platform that aims to bring Brazilian rural producers closer to their buyers and to integrate suppliers of agricultural inputs and carriers as a second step.      B2Brazil, the main B2B international business portal in the Americas with over 160,000 registered companies, and CNA, the main national representative of the Brazilian agricultural sector, will offer digital solutions so that small farmers can sell their products directly to final buyers, creating new channels for direct sales. The partnership has the strategic objective of offering a complete solution to rural producers, enabling the offer of agricultural inputs with competitive prices, and integrating with logistics companies to facilitate delivery, in addition to the active participation of buyers looking for their products directly from the farm.      "B2Brazil aims to facilitate trade for micro, small and medium-sized companies, connecting buyers and sellers worldwide. We believe that all the customization made for Mercado CNA will greatly help small Brazilian rural producers to create new sales channels through the digital world," said Alexandre Ferreira Martins, a partner and director of B2Brazil. "The strength and recognition of CNA, the legal and principal representative of rural producers in Brazil, brings a lot of credibility to the project and enables the massive participation of multiple companies linked to the agricultural sector that seek to bring solutions to producers in this moment of crisis."      "We are very excited about the launch of Mercado CNA," said Wilson Brandao, CNA's Business Manager. "This pandemic has considerably accelerated the digitization process and small rural producers could not be left out of this market. As the sector's legal and principal representative entity, we needed to bring a solution so that our member companies could promote and market their products online directly to final buyers. More importantly, we are helping rural producers to structure themselves at this moment for a process of selling rural products online that will consolidate even after the end of the pandemic."      With the launch of Mercado CNA, rural producers can now create their online profiles and promote their products directly to final buyers. The next stages of the project involve the integration with logistics companies and autonomous carriers, the offer of agricultural inputs with different conditions for the audience and the possibility of carrying out online transactions on the platform as a major rural e-commerce channel.      About B2Brazil   B2Brazil is the leading B2B trading platform in the Americas, focused on generating business-to-business contacts and transactions between Brazilian and international companies.

Wynnewood, PA, August 05, 2020 --(PR.com)-- This summer AFTHtv is dedicating its entire sixth season to serve as a program giving Black voices within the adoption triad (adoptive parents, birth parents, adoptees) the platform to discuss racial matters and adoption in today's society. New episodes air on the nonprofit's official Facebook page and YouTube channel every Tuesday. Social workers and adoption counselors in the domestic adoption world have a critical responsibility to educate prospective adoptive parents on everything to know about adopting a child transracially. It is important for social workers to offer black birth parents and black adoptive parents the chance to be mentors to transracial adoptive parents about black history and culture.      A few of the episode that have aired thus far are "Being Colorblind is NOT the answer," "Talking About Race with Our Children," and "Stereotypes About Adoption in the Black Community." The first three episodes aired include a group of three Black birth parents who welcomed the opportunity to meet with three white adoptive parents who have adopted transracially and are raising Black children.      Kristy Hartley-Galbraith, AFTH's Director of Marketing and Communications and AFTHtv Director & Producer explains why this is such an important season.      "As the Director and Producer of AFTHtv and more importantly as a parent through transracial adoption, with the current climate of racial justice in the U.S. it was important that we switch gears from our initial plans for this season and instead focus on highlighting Black voices in adoption. From its inception, AFTHtv has been a platform to lift often unheard voices in the world of adoption. This season we are honored to have Black birth parents, adoptive parents, and adoptees speak on a variety of topics related to race and adoption. There is so much more discussion to be had than can be covered in just one season however our hope is that the episodes will lead to larger discussions continuing to be had long after this season wraps," said Hartley- Galbraith.      Samai Nalley is a Black birth father who placed his newborn son for adoption with AFTH in 2014. Nalley recently expressed his appreciation to take part in a healthy dialogue where all parties were straightforward with their thoughts and questions regarding racial matters in today's social climate.      "I'm very appreciative to have had the opportunity to speak with each and everyone. I thank you all for your open mindedness and willingness to hear us out and even seek out the information. I hope to speak with you all soon," said Nalley.      SeAyra Greene is a mother of two, a daughter whom she is parenting, and a son she placed for adoption as a newborn in 2016. Through open adoption Greene has a relationship with her son and maintain the conversation with his adoptive parents about their racial culture and family history. Greene immediately welcomed the opportunity to talk about her experience growing up and living as a black woman in America to a larger audience through the AFTHtv program.      "I loved that I had a place to speak and I was actually being listened to. Some tough questions were asked and the answers that were given were so wonderfully received. I am so glad that we were given this opportunity to speak and I hope that this starts the spark needed to have these conversations," said Greene.      On future episodes this season, AFTHtv will feature the voices of Black adoptees and adoptive parents as well as birth parents and birth grandparents to continue highlighting different perspectives of Black voices in adoption.      About Adoptions From The Heart:   Adoptions From The Heart (AFTH) was founded in 1985 by Maxine Chalker, social worker and fellow adoptee. Like many children born and placed for adoption during the 1950s, Maxine grew up with little information about her birth parents. It was Maxine's dream to give adoption a new face by breaking down the barriers and taking some of the mystery out of the adoption process. AFTH is a nonprofit organization whose mission is to provide a safe, loving home for children and offer comprehensive, high-quality services to adoptive families, birth parents, and children. The agency is licensed in PA, NJ, DE, CT, VA, and NY.

It helps that the filmmakers found a group of compelling, complex subjects to follow for the week. They had many cameras operating simultaneously to manage this verité coup. There's the son of an immigrant who considers himself a progressive and believes that people truly yearn for bipartisanship. There's the bilateral amputee who only ever wanted to serve in the military, but now has decided that policy is the way to go. And there's the floppy-haired jock who runs on an anti-abortion, pro-gun platform and who isn't as stereotypical as you might assume at the beginning.
 They are divided, randomly, into Federalists and Nationalists and both groups can invent their own set of beliefs before putting forth their gubernatorial candidate. Naturally, the parties do start to resemble Democrats and Republicans, but it's at least something that they have the opportunity to create their own party lines.
 It's no wonder why "Boys State" swept the Sundance Film Festival earlier this year, where it won the grand jury prize. In this little microcosm you see not only a portrait of some serious-minded youths, but how their world views, morals and political beliefs have been molded by what's happening in the country. And it manages to be both hopeful and bleak about our political present and future.
 Weirdly, one of the most moving scenes is totally disconnected from the point of the camp: A talent show, in which a united crowd rallies behind a tap dancer, a kid with an acoustic guitar and a heartfelt rendition of "Hallelujah" and another solving a Rubik's Cube while Europe's "The Final Countdown" blares over the speakers.
 It's worth keeping in mind that these are, of course, minds that are still developing and on camera. Some are probably just out to win and entertain. And some are showing us their true selves. Like in the grown-up political world, it's sometimes hard to differentiate between the two.

Yes. Sure, David. Look, not really. So yes, we get some shorter term benefits from accelerating the decline to the lower levels of the current inventory, absolutely; that actually helps get us closer to the -- potentially the final depths of the shaft as well; so there is some give and take in that. Remembering the shaft expansion is not so much about the current reserve mining inventory, but it's more about the inferred and indicated resource that sits below the current mining inventory; so there is some swings and roundabouts in this. This project, the expansion of 4 million to 5 million tonnes per annum at Prominent Hill gives us shorter term benefits from a cash flow perspective and helps us reduce operating costs and it maintains critical path and access for the shaft expansion. So, look, in essence, it doesn't really cannibalize the shaft expansion and we're in parallel pushing pretty hard on that project. So we'll be able to give you a steady update on that a little bit later on this year.

Burlington, Canada, August 01, 2020 --(PR.com)-- This is the first service launched since COVID-19 in Canada when the team worked with many organizations and discovered their business challenges to maintain business continuity and attain business productivity & efficiency goals.      Robotic process automation is the revolutionary technology or automation form which has the ultimate potential to transform the business landscape. It helps businesses put repetitive and time-consuming tasks on auto-pilot, resulting in fewer errors and high productivity. Most importantly, it reduces the dependency on the dynamic and unskilled workforce.      Grand View Research reveals that the RPA market will reach $25.56 billion by 2027 from $358 million in 2017. According to Deloitte's third annual RPA survey, 78% of businesses who have already implemented RPA are planning to invest more in RPA. Based on this survey, Deloitte believes that RPA will achieve "near-universal adoption" in the next 5 years.      To leverage RPA, SyS Creations has mastered the less-explored part of the RPA - Cognitive RPA. The Cognitive RPA takes the capabilities of the RPA to the next level by utilizing cutting edge technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning and natural language processing.      The CEO of the SyS Creations strongly believes that RPA will help massively to the industries contributing most to the global GDP such as banking, healthcare, manufacturing.

Hi, Rob. I'll ask Warrick to answer the CapEx number piece. But just in concept, as you know at Prominent Hill, we've been working to get the underground ore extraction rate up to that 4 million tonne per annum run rate for a couple of years now. The team has demonstrated that it can sustainably hold that right over the last few months. And in action, some time has exceeded. As a result of us getting that confidence, we've now advanced them sufficient money to accelerate some of the future decline development. So what that means is that they will ramp down into the Malu ore body faster than we had originally planned and opened up a new mining front. That new mining front effectively derisk the mining sequence and derisks the criticality of backfill to allow us to step-up the mining rights. And as we flagged, we believe we'll get it upto between 4 million and 5 million tonnes per year from 2022 onwards, and we'll hold it at that rate.

The announcements made by the finance minister, when coupled with all the subsidies given to various sections of the Indian populace has made the coffers of the Indian Government touch rock bottom. It is abundantly clear, that whatever we do or plan to do, it requires generous dollops of money. This is not just a simple matter. We have to ensure that, from now, on the Indian Government gets larger financial resources and money from commercial activity within our own country. The recent shocks on our northern border have made us finally realise the importance of self-reliance. The irony is that the Chinese have shown us the writing on the wall. China has already built a vast industry which has generated massive surpluses for the Chinese economy, and it is that money which has enabled them to build a military machine to back up their huge financial muscle. This they now use to dictate terms not only to their neighbours but to the whole world at large. China has used its finances more than its military, and with resounding success. If we are to retaliate to such threats, then our nation also has to also build large financial resources. That, in black and white, is the key.

In the midst of this disarray was also a pitched battle tug-of-war between City Hall and the radical left over just how much officials wanted to neuter police in Seattle, none of which actually took into account what Seattle police might actually need to do their job. This ended up with Seattle Police Chief Carmen Best resigning and with cuts that didn't end up satisfying the radical left, who still want to recall Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan.

On aspirations; we introduced this slide at our Strategy Day in June to share our strategic aspirations with you. These provide a guiding light for us and will help shape the future of OZ Minerals. These are not easy aspirations but they are exciting, and they are necessary for us to continue our journey to becoming a modern mining company. Many people have asked us about what's next at OZ Minerals, especially in light of COVID-19? As a company, when we think about risk, we take both, an opportunity and a threat perspective. We saw that while COVID-19 brought with it a lot of uncertainty, we also identified that it brings opportunity. As a result, and instead of initiating across this recovery process, we launched a project beyond; a project to help accelerate us towards our strategy, leveraging the situation we'll find ourselves in.

Last week, Justice not only awarded matching grants for more than 320 fairs and festivals funded in the budget bill, but increased funding for the State Fair of West Virginia from $31,000 in the budget bill to $300,000, increasing total funding for fairs and festivals to nearly $1.7 million.
 Justice reiterated Tuesday that, because virtually all fairs and festivals around the state were canceled this year, as many as half would not survive financially without the cash infusions.
 “It was reported to me that many of our fairs and festivals are on the ropes,” he said, adding, “They’re not flush with cash, that’s for sure.”
 As he did last week, Justice had several recipients of the grants personally thank him for the funding via a Zoom teleconference.
 Although intended to provide a source of immediate funding in emergencies, state law authorizes the governor to make appropriations out of the civil contingency fund as he “may deem necessary and proper.”
 While running for re-election in 2000, then-Gov. Cecil Underwood handed out a total of nearly $16 million in grants and awards from the civil contingency fund from July 1 to Election Day. The move drew criticism from challenger Bob Wise, among others, who accused Underwood of using taxpayer dollars for “one of the largest publicly funded campaigns” in the country.
 Justice on Tuesday closed out the grants presentation by saying he was acting out of a true belief in the economic and societal benefits of state culture and arts.
 “I’m not a politician and I don’t blow smoke at anyone,” he said. “When I tell you something, I mean it, and I mean it from the bottom of my heart.”

One of those backs, All-Area linebacker/fullback Jansen Moreland (6-3, 225) — who his coach believes could be a contender for All-State in 2020 — has emerged as a senior leader for the inexperienced Falcon squad that returns just three contributors each on offense and defense.
 Despite having a wealth of relative unknowns, Whiteman is confident with what he's seen so far from his unproven players.
 "We have a lot of good kids coming back. Not with a lot of experience, but I still feel good," he said. "Frankfort always has big expectations, and we’re looking for some good things. We’ve have some kids that have really worked hard during the offseason, even when we were not able to be in the school because of the virus. The kids were working out on their own and doing stuff at home. Looking for some big things from some of the seniors."
 Despite Whiteman's optimism about his players' potential, he's understandably apprehensive about how far along his team is at this point with the first game just weeks away. In a normal season, Frankfort would've started xxxx
 He's still confident the Falcons will be ready come kickoff time against Hampshire the first week of September.
 "No, my lord no,” Whiteman said when asked if the Falcons were where he'd like them to be at this stage. “It’s going to be difficult, with today being the first official day of being able to have a practice. Next Friday night we’re gonna be in Moorefield for a scrimmage, so we’re behind the eight ball already.
 "I’m confident we’re gonna have things prepared pretty well by the time the first game rolls around. But starting today the way we are, we’re definitely behind schedule."
 For the season to stay afloat and even get to that opening contest, the student-athletes, coaches and people of Mineral County will need to continue to take precautions to prevent an outbreak.
 Governor Jim Justice unveiled a color-coded system for how many cases per 100,000 people would result in a suspended season. Mineral County has maintained a green level, meaning it can go ahead with extracurricular activities as scheduled, but if people don't do their best to follow the safety precautions, even a small outbreak could be the nail in the coffin for the year.
 “I told them up there before we came down, ‘We can only control what we can control: ourselves,'" Whiteman said. "There are a lot of factors outside. That’s why I wish everyone would embrace what they’re trying to do, but everyone’s not going to do that. So it’s definitely an issue, and it’s probably gonna be a problem here sooner than later."
 As for their part, the Frankfort football team looked to be doing well following the state of West Virginia's guidelines to limit any potential spread. And though Whiteman, like many people, would rather not be wearing a mask — especially not with the sun beating down on him during football practice — he knows it's necessary if there's going to be a football season.
 “It’s very awkward wearing a mask. Last week it was 96 degrees on two different days, and it was pretty miserable," he said. "Staying after the kids to stay socially distanced and have their masks on, it’s a challenge but we’ll do whatever we have to do to have a season."

Uber and Lyft are hoping a courtroom reprieve will spare them from shutting down their rival smartphone-summoned ride services in California on Friday.
 The companies are awaiting word from an appeals court whether they will be able to delay having to abide by a new state law that officials argue requires them to reclassify drivers as employees entitled to worker benefits.
 A judge gave them until the end of Thursday to make the change, which both companies argue is too complex and costly to do quickly.
 Uber and Lyft have said they will suspend ride services in their home state, most likely until after voters in November determine the fate of a proposition they are sponsoring.
 The proposition, which would become law if approved, would keep drivers classified as contractors but provide benefits such as health care.
 "California is trying to do the right thing, but this is the wrong time for it," said technology analyst Rob Enderle of Enderle Group, referring to a job market crippled by the pandemic.
 "This is not a time when you want to knock a whole lot of people out of work, which is the danger here."
 A judge last week granted a restraining order in a lawsuit filed by California attorney general Xavier Becerra and three cities including San Francisco, where Lyft and Uber are based.
 The suit calls on the two rideshare companies to comply with a new state law that requires "gig workers" to be classified as employees, eligible for unemployment, medical and other benefits.
 \- Driverless future? -
 A judge ordered Uber and Lyft to reclassify drivers as employees and has refused pleas to extend his deadline past Thursday, according to an appeal filed by Lyft.
 "Because Lyft cannot make the changes the injunction requires at the flip of a switch, absent immediate action by this court, Lyft will be forced to suspend its rideshare operations in California," the company argued in its appeal.
 This would cause "widespread disruption to hundreds of thousands of drivers, millions of riders and the state's transportation infrastructure," according to the appeal.
 Uber's chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi has said the company will "have to essentially shut down Uber until November when the voters decide."
 Uber and Lyft back a referendum to overturn the law, while pledging to provide benefits for a social safety net that would keep gig workers independent.
 The rideshare rivals maintain that most of their drivers want to remain independent even if they also are looking for benefits.
 "We don't even know if we are going to keep driving, because of this situation," said Alexander Palacios, a 43-year-old Uber driver in Los Angeles.
 "Honestly, I don't mind, because I think Uber and Lyft deserve it because they've been doing really bad to drivers for a long time."
 A backup plan for Uber would be to pause operations in California, eventually restarting with "a much smaller service, much higher prices" according to Khosrowshahi.
 The threat to its business model puts pressure on Uber to move faster toward its vision of dispatching self-driving cars to provide rides on demand, Enderle said.
 "Uber is pivoting to autonomous cars, so something was going to happen to the drivers anyway," Enderle said.
 "You were either going to be an employee or you were going to be unemployed; there was a sword of Damocles hanging over this anyway."

SHORT GAP, W.Va — With whistles chirping, kickoffs being booted and passes soaring through the warm August air, all finally felt right with the world: football season is finally upon us.
 But at the first official practice at Frankfort High School on Monday, much like every other secondary school in the state there were other identifiable features of this novel coronavirus era of sports. Coaches wearing masks, social distancing and a noticeable lack of high-fives.
 And though the hopes of a football season could be dashed as quickly as it's started, it's been restored for now. For Falcon head coach Kevin Whiteman, seeing the opening afternoon of practice was an almost surreal experience.

“One senior White House official has even told us that the 15-billion-gallon conventional level for the RFS was ‘biblical’ to you,” the four wrote. “Yet, the fact of the matter is that the RFS has not actually been enforced at the statutory levels during the four years of your presidency.”
 They charge the EPA has undermined the fuel rule by granting dozens and dozens of “illegal” refinery exemptions — destroying demand for more than 4 billion gallons of biofuels — and now is considering a plan to grant retroactive “hardship” exemptions for oil companies dating back as far as 2011.
 “Mr. President, you have the power to immediately end the frustration of farmers related to biofuels and to remove all doubt of your commitment to the RFS,” according to the letter, which is similar to one issued last week when Vice President Mike Pence visited Iowa.
