 # Former Liberty DPW supervisor pleads guilty to theft
 Heather Yakin
 Times Herald-Record
 MONTICELLO - A former working supervisor for the Village of Liberty Department of Public Works pleaded guilty on Monday to stealing more than $17,000 by using village funds to pay DPW employees to do work for his private construction business, said Sullivan County’s Acting District Attorney, Meagan Galligan.
 Peter Parks, 62, of Liberty pleaded guilty in Sullivan County Court to third- degree grand larceny, a felony. Galligan said Parks admitted in court that the conduct took place between 2014 and 2019. Parks would have the two DPW employees work on construction jobs for his private business, Peter Parks Construction, and would approve payroll documentation that falsely stated the employees had been working for the village at those times, Galligan said. The total amount taken was $17,718.18, Galligan said.
 “Village of Liberty taxpayers trusted Peter Parks to be honest,” Galligan said in a statement. “He violated and abused the public’s confidence in him to his own benefit. There is no justification for having hardworking Village taxpayers pay people who were working at his private business.”
 If Parks abides by all of his release conditions and pays $6,000 in restitution by his scheduled Jan. 14 sentencing, Galligan said, Acting Sullivan County Court Judge Stephan Schick agreed to a sentence of five years of probation, with repayment of the balance of the money as a condition of probation. The charge carries a maximum sentence of two and a half to seven years in prison.

 # Revised management plan for Columbia River Gorge approved
 Associated Press
 SALEM — A new management plan that will guide future decisions and address urgent issues like climate change has been approved for the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area.
 Oregon Public Broadcasting reports the Columbia River Gorge Commission approved a revised Management Plan Tuesday, marking just the second time it’s been updated in 29 years.
 The 292,000-acre Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area is shared by Oregon and Washington. It supports endangered salmon runs, has five major ecosystems supporting 800 species of flowering plants and hosts a diversity of wildlife.
 The revised management plan includes new policies like doubling the size of protective steam buffers for salmon habitat, requiring an analysis if any of the 13 urban areas within the designated scenic area wants to expand and placing limits on the amount of land that can be used for urban development. It also adds greater restrictions on new construction in forest zones to reduce fire risks.
 For the first time, the management plan requires a climate action strategy to continue to protect the region and adapt to changing climate. It also requires the development of diversity, equity and inclusion policies to help diversify the commissions, its staff, and develop an equity lens to make sure all voices are heard in the decision making process.

 # Local ski areas to reopen with 75% capacity outdoors, 50% capacity indoors
 Daniel Axelrod
 Times Herald-Record
 Ski area representatives are hailing Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s Sunday announcement that the industry can soon open at 75% capacity outdoors and 50% indoors, while bracing to weather accompanying financial challenges.
 Beginning Nov. 6, ski areas can reopen with masks required at all times, except when visitors are eating, drinking or skiing; social distancing; plus gondolas and lifts restricted to members of the same party; ski lessons limited to 10 people; and thorough cleaning of shared and rented equipment, Cuomo’s office said.
 Beyond the governor’s Sunday announcement, local ski area operators are awaiting formal state guidance on reopening during the coronavirus.
 But the businesses' owners worked closely with the governor, and they’re largely pleased with, and unsurprised by, the restrictions announced so far, said Scott Brandi, president of iSkiNY, New York’s skiing trade association.
 Operators will “do the math to make sure we can get enough customers to make money,” said Craig Passante, owner of Holiday Mountain, which includes seven runs, three lifts and a tubing area in the Town of Thompson. “Just being allowed to open is a plus.
 “But if there are too many restrictions, we’re hamstrung,” Passante added. “It’s like New York City restaurants. They can’t survive on 50%” of their normal business.
 Skiing is especially critical to the Hudson Valley and the Catskills, which boast 98 peaks over 3,000 feet, larger ski areas like Hunter, Belleayre and Windham mountains and a number of smaller operators.
 Yet, ski areas aren’t just for skiing. Some sites include golf and ropes courses, zip lines, action sports, concerts, camps and other attractions and events.
 And local site operators say they’ve been hit hard in 2020 by a coronavirus pandemic that’s prevented off-season events from running, while halving the capacity for whatever the state has permitted.
 Holiday Mountain, a 153-acre site in Sullivan County, has struggled to make mortgage payments and even missed a few because of the pandemic, Passante said.
 From bowling alleys to the amusement parks like the Castle Fun Center in Chester, some recreational and leisure businesses could close or be sold because of the pandemic, Passante said.
 And locals should realize that the sales of such businesses can be tragic, too, because owners can “get pennies on the dollar and lose the dreams they've spent years working for,” Passante added.
 Nonetheless, the operators of New York’s 50 ski areas, which generate $1 billion in economic activity each winter alone, “are used to dealing with uncontrollable variables like the weather, and the pandemic is another uncontrollable variable,” Brandi said.
 “We’ll survive” the pandemic, Brandi added. This year, “We don’t want record ski days. We just want to be able to manage our crowds and keep our customers and staffs safe.”
