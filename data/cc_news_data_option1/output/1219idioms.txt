NASCAR had promised a shakeup of its staid schedule in 2021, but the crisis may force the stock car series to offer a sneak peak the rest of the summer. Mid-week races, night races, doubleheaders, nothing is off the starting grid when it comes to potential scenarios to squeeze in the remaining 32 Cup races. NASCAR offered a break with tradition in June with Pocono Raceway set to hold a NASCAR Cup Series twin bill, with one race on Saturday, one on Sunday. The test run for '21 could now be forced on at least another track -- with Dover the top target -- before this season is over.

 As the new coronavirus spreads, it has exposed a variety of societal vulnerabilities. For example, giant cities have seen how their long-touted lifestyle -- packing more and more people into less and less space -- can endanger public health.
   
 Those in more rural settings shouldn't feel smug, however. Those sprinkled among the countryside of Kansas are in some ways even less prepared than those in urban areas. The lack of hospital facilities and emergency services is the first gap that comes to mind.
   
 But there's another shortcoming, one that has been highlighted for years and will only make this experience more difficult. That's the lack of broadband internet access.
   
 How might that make this current crisis worse? There are several ways. First, with schools across the state closed, educators are moving their classes online. Students in rural areas were already disadvantaged without broadband, but if education itself is primarily dispensed online, where does this leave them?
   
 That's not all. Routine doctor's visits are shifting toward telemedicine, which is perhaps ill-named. It's more accurately described as video- conferencing medicine. Again, without the support of broadband internet, online meetings with your doctor will be all but impossible for rural folks. And with rural hospitals dwindling, that access was already precarious to begin with.
   
 Finally, this is a rapidly changing, historical event. Yet because of social distancing requirements, we are largely experiencing it alone. Social media and other online tools can bring us closer together, if only virtually. Again, lack of broadband makes that challenging.
   
 So what's the answer? The Legislature has repeatedly talked about this problem, but we haven't seen decisive action yet.
   
 Internet providers, which are interested in making a profit, don't see a sustainable business in the miles upon miles of fields and tiny towns of rural Kansas.
   
 Once this crisis passes -- and it will pass -- lawmakers will need to solve this problem once and for all. Do providers need incentives? Will some sort of public-private partnership need to be created? Surely the problem has solutions, if all sides work toward them in good faith.
   
 What's unacceptable is seeing rural areas once again being left behind during a time of great social change. These communities, and these residents, are no more or less Kansans than the rest of us.
   
 They deserve access to the same utility services -- and that's what broadband internet is, make no mistake -- as the rest of us.

It can change if people can sit at the table. But going back to the financial crisis, many of the key G20 leaders at that time - people like Gordon Brown, Barack Obama, Kevin Rudd and Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva - these people have disappeared from our ranks, along with their experience. They acted together. What we're seeing now is a kind of retreat, which might be understandable emotionally, but it's not going to help us. Solidarity and sharing and deciding on how you protect people – both within nations and globally - is absolutely critical at the moment. We are trying desperately with some of the business community to rebuild that social dialogue with labour organizations, businesses and governments. But while it works tremendously well in some democratic countries, by and large it's not working in the majority of the world's countries and it's not working globally.

On top of genetics and underlying health conditions, there are a few external factors that can cause darkening in the area. Deodorants and antiperspirants have ingredients that can irritate the skin, and any inflammation can lead to a thickening -- and darkening -- of the skin over time. "Many antiperspirants use aluminum as an active ingredient," says Dr. Solomon. "It clogs up sweat ducts and, in the process, irritates the skin." Other ingredients to look out for are fragrance and alcohol, both of which can be harsh on sensitive skin types. Another source of irritation: your razor. Shaving, especially on dry skin or with a dull blade, can cause the skin to darken and thicken over time.

Rails – a Café at the Depot
 Owners Melissa Southern and John Hagerla have been serving “contemporary American cuisine” at Rails for 16 years in the renovated train depot with two historic markers.
 They recently added a guesthouse on their grounds in addition to the Event Hall that was already hosting group events, and their bakery/candy store.
 But like most food service locations across Kerr County, that daily operation plan has been superseded by new rules to limit “community spread” of the COVID-19 virus.
 Even before the governor’s announcements, Southern said her guesthouse customers were calling to cancel their reservations.
 The local cost to the Kerrville community is interrupted income to the owners and staff, possible staff layoffs and scrambling to offer alternative services such as take-out, and delivery by Grub Runners and others.
 At first Southern thought they could continue dine-in service by seating patrons farther apart, and keep their 25 servers employed. But new rules from Texas Gov. Greg Abbott took that option away from the already-fluid situation last week.
 “We prepare everything ‘organic’ when we can; and we don’t fry anything,” Southern said. “We only use olive oil, and the food is yummy but still healthy.”
 She said before changes required by COVID-19, Rails was open Monday through Saturday from 11 a.m.-9 p.m. with continuous service, and a staff that included some who have worked for her more than 15 years.
 But she was speaking from a nearly empty dining room by mid-week last week, even before Abbott called for such public gathering spaces to be closed.
 “Normally Spring Break would be very busy for us. We have wonderful local regular customers and great visitors who come here.”
 She said capacity for their restaurant is 45 people inside and 50 on their patio. “We were taking reservations but they weren’t required,” she said. “And we can offer beer and wine.”
 The new rules draw firm lines between “essential businesses” such as grocery stores, hospitals, doctors’ offices, and gas stations; compared to restaurants, movie theaters and other social events.
 “We’ve had other interruptions over the years, including ice storms and Hurricane Harvey. But even in the case of Harvey, we helped cook the food the American Red Cross served to people including the refugees from the coast,” Southern said.
 She said under the new rules to close, they can fill take-out orders; and people can order wine to go with their orders of food. She said they carry some unusual wines, and have had some consistently favorite dishes stay on their menu, even though they changed other things on the menu every six months.
 Southern said Rail’s staff have always had “an extensive sanitizing protocol” while making customers feel at ease being out.
 “We’re still a small town, after all,” she said.
 But even the early stages of COVID-19, their staff/servers were cleaning high- touch surfaces every hour and using single-use sanitizing wipes on tables and chairs; while removing all reusable items such as salt and pepper shakers from tables. She said they also were offering single-use tableware.
 “We’re going through a lot of gloves for serving,” Southern said last week, “and practicing social distancing. But customers have their favorite tables and some don’t want to move. And they’re not hugging us hard. I miss that.”
 She said their patio as popular, as a very pleasant place where people could even take their pets. (Their menu included items on a dog menu.)
 Last week she said she knew some places were shutting down to providing only take-out. But she didn’t want to do that because it would affect her staff. “We made promises to our staff to keep them on board.”
 “I think about our local businesses and customers telling me they came in to try to support the restaurants. We have a nice community and that’s what makes Kerrville special,” Southern said.
 Her agreement as of late last week was to work with Grub Runners Delivery Service, to provide Rails food to customers, via online and paper menus as needed.
 Grub Runners
 Rebekah and Michael Haynes and Rachel Quillen are partners in this two-year- old delivery service, Rebekah Haynes said.
 They offer delivery from area restaurants to residents in Kerr residents as far away as Center Point, Hunt and Ingram.
 In this service, the customer can request or use an online menu or app on a computer or smart phone to order food from a local restaurant, and pay for the food with a credit or debit card. Such delivery services usually add a fee for their service on top of food cost.
 Haynes said they already offer free delivery (no added fee) to customers 55 and over.
 In this emergency period, they are partnering with Rails for free delivery, while continuing free delivery to the elderly.
 She said their employees are all “food-service handler-certified” and have sanitizers in their cars. They usually deliver within 45 minutes or less, and also can leave the food in boxes on customers’ porches, “contact-less,” by previous agreement when ordering, she said, if customers don’t want physical contact with the delivery person.
 Haynie said she used to live in San Antonio; and used a like service there, after getting home from work late and not wanting to go out again.
 The Grub Runners are familiar with the area restaurants, and she said when customers call, they can discuss what food the caller likes, or doesn’t, and where to get the best XX or YY.
 Some customers are calling them twice a day now. And she knows of one customer who called their number when she was having a stroke at home because that was the only phone number she could remember.

The manufacture of craft vodka has emerged as an art form in several regions. Moreover, craft vodka has gained popularity at a stellar rate across the globe, and people have welcomed this form of liquor with open arms. Hence, there is little doubt the fact that the global craft vodka market would accumulate voluminous revenues in the years to follow.

IT IS time to think outside the box and look at the solution staring us in the face to help limit the COVID-19 pandemic in New South Wales.


  Twelve kilometres southeast of Grafton, NSW, the Clarence Correctional Centre is sitting empty, a ready-made quarantine facility if ever there was one.


  There quite possibly might not be another location on earth so well equipped to deal with an influx of patients required to be isolated from the general population, and the timing is perfect.


  As if by fate, just this week many of the contractors finished packing up their tools after three years of construction to hand the finished product over to Serco. Job done, leaving behind a highly secure, state-of-the art facility with unused medical, catering and general community services available at the ready, and, by the sounds of things, an enviable amount of comfort afforded to the criminals who will one day call the 1700-bed facility home.


  Clarence Correctional Centre could house all COVID-19 patients from the Northern NSW Local Health District at the peak of this outbreak, and possibly further afield – and such measures are well overdue.


  Our nation is now paying for the disastrous decision to let people pour freely through the airport gates, sending those who test positive home in the trust that they will have the common sense to self-isolate and to do it properly.


  The effects of this pandemic have already been catastrophic to our economy and will be long-lasting, but the longer it goes the more damaging that impact will be.


  Our nation is sophisticated enough for most sectors to have a safety net of welfare and employee entitlements to fall back on for a period. But like the brain eventually shuts down when oxygen is cut off for long enough, our society as we know it can only survive on life support and no genuine cashflow for so long. It won’t take long for the cash splash pool to dry up.


  So let’s flatten that damn curve and quarantine victims properly – short term pain for long term gain.


  The only downside is that the prospect of being sent to a facility like this might make some people hesitant to be tested, and the dangerous ones are not those who are very sick and dying under strict supervision in hospitals – it’s those with mild symptoms told to go home and are trusted to do the right thing, or worse still, that don’t get tested at all.


  Grafton will soon become home to the largest jail population in the southern hemisphere when it opens to 1700 inmates later in the year – or whenever the time is right.


  But in the meantime, why not gain the more palatable notoriety of being home to the largest and best quarantine facility in the world in the fight against a global pandemic? The time IS right for that.


  And what a story to tell on the other side for all the sick law-abiding folk who would otherwise never have set afoot inside a jail in their lives.


  We’re all having to make a few adjustments. So if we’re truly a global community in this fight together, then surely Serco can come to the party.


  I think we can safely assume the grip of this pandemic will remain tight when the prisoners are scheduled to arrive at a date yet to be announced between June and August, and surely under these conditions it’s not the time to be working out the logistics of transporting 1700 new inmates to this brand new facility.


  For Serco it’s a never-before opportunity to test run their systems before the real deal - to make sure they get THIS jail right.


  In truth, Serco’s done a fantastic job thus far bringing employment to the Clarence Valley, and developing and supporting several community engagement projects. But hell, outside this forgotten enclave on the North Coast, they could do with a good news story, right?


  Desperate times call for desperate measures.

Sure, different human populations living in distinct places may statistically have different genetic traits—such as sickle cell trait (discussed below)—but such variation is about local populations (people in a specific region), not race.

Manchester United will refund supporters if they have to play their remaining home games of the season behind closed doors or if they are scrapped due to the coronavirus pandemic.
 The deadline for season ticket renewals for next season has also been suspended, with no indication as to when the current campaign can re-start.
 English football has been suspended until April 30, but a meeting of Premier League clubs next week is expected to push that date further back.
 United would be one of the clubs worst affected should the 2019-’20 season fail to be completed as they sit fifth in the Premier League, outside the Champions League places, and are still involved in the latter stages of the Europa League and FA Cup.
 However, Manchester City’s two-season ban from European competition could allow their city rivals to qualify for the Champions League if it is upheld for next season.
 “The club fully supports the collective intent to complete the Premier League, FA Cup and the Uefa club competitions,” United said in a statement on Friday.
 “However, if it were decided that games cannot be played, or needed to be played behind closed doors, Manchester United confirms it will offer season ticket holders either a pro-rata rebate against their season tickets for next year, or a pro-rata cash refund based on the number of games still to be played.
 “The season ticket renewal deadline, initially 1 May, has been suspended.”
 United have also committed to paying 3,000 casual staff for their remaining five home Premier League games even if they are cancelled or played behind closed doors.
 Earlier this month, the Red Devils paid travelling fans £350 ($429) towards travel and accommodation costs when their Europa League last-16, first-leg match against LASK in Austria was forced behind closed doors at short notice.
 “By pushing the season ticket renewal deadline back and confirming our policy if games were to be cancelled or played behind closed doors, we want to ease any concerns our loyal fans may have in the current circumstances,” said Richard Arnold, United’s Group Managing Director.
 “They give Manchester United their support year after year, and at this time, we are committed to supporting them. Our message to them is clear – we are all in this together.”

The England and Wales Cricket Board is planning to install coronavirus checkpoints and isolation units at grounds in its bid to resume international cricket without any spectator.
 The ECB had suspended all professional cricket till May 28, delaying the start of the new season, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, which has killed nearly 22,000 people globally.
 However, ECB director of events Steve Elworthy said they are looking at ways to resume play inside closed doors and that it would need a sterile “bubble” to ensure the identification of anyone in the vicinity who was carrying the virus.
 “We’re mapping out what international matches would look like behind closed doors,” Elworthy told the _Guardian_.
 The UK government had banned mass gathering of more than 500 prior to current under lockdown to contain the virus.
 Alluding to the initial government advice, Elworthy said: “The advice around mass gatherings was 500 people or fewer.
 “That was guided by the potential impact on critical services like paramedics and doctors.
 “You would likely have to work within that number (which would be made up of essential matchday staff)... then you have to think about medical provisions, creating a safe and sterile environment around that venue, so that everyone who comes in is clear.
 “So it’s how you test them at the gate, the isolation units that you have to put in. These are considerations we are thinking about.”
 England are set to host four teams – West Indies, Australia, Pakistan and Ireland this year, while England’s women are due to host South Africa and India.
 “We’re now thinking of all these things, the risks posed, and it just gets bigger and wider,” Elworthy said.
 “But if that is the situation we are faced with then we will deliver on absolutely every single one of those to make sure it does happen.”
 Elworthy, however, insisted everyone’s safety is the priority and the decision to conduct matches will not be decided by the economic need.
 “One thing you have to consider is the national mood. You might be able to deliver a match but would it be the right thing? Operationally, we believe we can deliver anything but we have to have an eye on that. You don’t just operate in a bubble, you need peripheral vision.
 “(And) making sure everyone is in a safe environment is front and centre of the discussions.

The attorney for a Columbia man serving an indeterminate sentence for contempt of court wants a judge to suspend the sentence during the COVID-19 pandemic.


   


  Seth Reynolds has been reporting to the Boone County Jail every night. Boone County Sheriff Dwayne Carey has set new rules, restricting civilians from entering the jail and canceling visits for detainees.


   


  And the number of people being booked into the jail has fallen dramatically. Over the past week, an average of seven people per day have been processed, down from an average of 14 per day in the previous week.


   


  Reynolds is serving an indefinite term ordered by Circuit Judge Jodie Asel, who found him to be in violation of local zoning code in May 2017 and ordered a garage and other structures removed. After an appellate court sided with her in May 2019 -- and the garage was still in place -- she ordered him to indefinite overnight jail stays until he complies.


   


  Reynolds arrives every evening at 6:30 p.m. and leave every morning at 6 a.m.


   


  Reynolds is concerned about possibly catching or spreading the coronavirus while in the jail.


   


  Information on the spread of the virus is not fully known and there have been cases of community transmission in recent days, he said.


   


  "I am normally held in the holding area and those cells could have more than 10 people held in them temporarily during the day, depending on the arrests made," Reynolds said. "The virus can live on steel, concrete and glass up to nine days. If the jail gets exposed, it's little more than a COVID-19 petri dish. It will spread like wildfire."


   


  Reynolds' attorney, Steve Wyse, filed a motion Tuesday asking Asel to alter her order until the outbreak subsides. In his motion, he cites actions taken by correctional facilities around the nation to reduce the spread of the virus, including the release of many non-violent, low-level offenders.


   


  The courts have halted all but the most pressing matters, so it is unknown if or when she will consider the motion. The motion requests that Reynolds serve his commitment on house arrest due to the pandemic.


   


  "There is a heightened risk for the jail population," Wyse said. "Having Seth coming in and out puts him at heightened risk and puts people in jail at heightened risk that Seth might be a carrier. The county is taking a very hard-line stance, saying that they don't want to see any modifications."


   


  Boone County is under a stay-at-home order announced Tuesday.


   


  Former judge and local attorney Gary Oxenhandler and attorney Rusty Antel expressed the same concerns as Reynolds and Wyse to county officials in a March 19 email.


   


  "... though Rusty and I are not epidemiologists, it would appear obvious that Mr. Reynolds poses a significant risk to the jail population as he is daily- released, mingles with the public and is returned to the jail," Oxenhandler and Antel wrote. "It's time to set aside our county pride. Release him, put him on house arrest, put him on home detention -- God forbid an outbreak occurs at the jail."


   


  Correctional facilities around the nation have been taking drastic measures to halt or reduce the spread of the virus. Some in the areas hardest hit, such as New York and New Jersey, are freeing low-level, high-risk detainees en masse, citing outbreak concerns.


   


  Peggy Placier, a volunteer for the Race Matters, Friends, wrote to Carey that the nonprofit is concerned with a lack of information on what is being done to protect health at the facility.


   


  "COVID-19 poses severe infection risks whenever people are in close physical proximity with others, regardless of whether an individual shows symptoms," Placier wrote. "In response to the potential humanitarian crisis in jails in our city, we ask that you advocate for a large release."


   


  Law enforcement agencies should also, when possible, issue a summons instead of detaining the person in the county jail, Placier writes.


   


  "Additionally, please ask that officers in county and municipal departments stop making arrests when possible or cite and release people instead of bringing them into custody," Placier writes. "Do not add to the jail population if at all avoidable."


   


  Presiding Judge Kevin Crane, in an order Tuesday, advised agencies they will have discretion in making arrests on failure to appear warrants.


   


  Columbia police will consider arrests on a case-by-case basis in light of Crane's order, while keeping public safety a priority, city spokesman Steve Sapp wrote in an email.


   


  "Judge Crane's order allows discretion in an effort to reduce contacts and slow the spread of COVID-19," Sapp wrote. "The safety of the public will remain our number one focus."


   


  Boone County appears to be taking some steps to screen and limit the jail population .


   


  Jailers are taking the temperatures of everyone entering and exiting the facility and logging symptoms, Reynolds said.


   


  As of Wednesday morning, there were 219 people in custody at the jail, down from more than 280 at the beginning of the month


   


  "Things seem a little tense," Reynolds said. "The staff seem to understand the dangers."

The number of reported drug and medicine thefts has increased consistently over the last few years. An increase in prescription drug abuse is the primary reason for rising drug burglaries. Many of such burglary cases involve medical professionals who intend to sell the drugs in the black market. To avoid such thefts, drugs are stored in secure safes and vaults that are accessible only by authorized personnel. Governing bodies are also promoting safe drug storage and supply to avoid the illegal use of opioids. Thus, the demand for safes and vaults from healthcare industry is expected to increase substantially, which will drive the growth of the market during the forecast period.

“Over the last 12 months, our surface exploration drilling at Lamaque has focused on better defining the resource potential in the less-explored lower portion of the Triangle Deposit, with a view to expanding mineral resources in 2020,” said Burns in a press release in September, 2019. “At the same time, our underground drilling continues to focus on conversion of existing resources to reserves in the C5 and lower C4 mineralized zones,” he said.

Oil drillers are facing major headwinds today because of low commodity prices. But there's a big difference between a tiny onshore U.S. oil driller with weak finances and a diversified global energy giant like Chevron. In fact, the company just came out and announced plans to cut its capital spending by 20% to preserve its financial strength and protect its dividend. That's par for the course here, noting that Chevron has increased its dividend annually for 32 consecutive years.

While a 13.8% profit margin may not sound too shabby to you and me, the company realizes an effective profit margin of _97.5%_ from producing its own gas. Stepping up production to fulfill its contracts without needing to buy outside gas -- and eliminating this cost -- helped to boost Cabot's earnings.

After the inescapable ubiquity of millennial pink, the loud entry of Gen-Z yellow and popularity of slime green, brown as an It colour might feel like an especially dull downgrade. But its rising popularity in fashion is undeniable. Global trend forecaster WGSN reported that brown is the fastest-growing colour in womenswear, with a 24 per cent year-over-year increase in the United States. On the runways, brown was a staple at established brands like Acne Studios and Fendi, and at cool, trendsetting upstarts like London's Rejina Pyo. To be clear, we're not talking about camel (a shade about as classic as black), but a warmer, darker hue reminiscent of molten chocolate or ground cinnamon.

Come preparare in casa il pane senza lievito. E' facile basta seguire alcune regole semplici per la preparazione. Si tratta di un'antica ricetta della nonna che puo tornare utile oggi ai tempi del coronavirus ovvero quando non si deve uscire di casa e quando il lievito di birra diventa introvabile anche nei supermercati. Questo e un pane adatto a tutte quelle persone che hanno intolleranze ai lieviti. Preparate un'autolisi: versare in una ciotola 190 g di acqua (prelevati dal totale) e tutta la farina, miscelate giusto il tempo di far idratare la farina, lasciate riposare per 40 minuti circa.Trascorso il tempo, inserite nella stessa ciotola dove ha riposato l'autolisi, l'acqua rimanente, il sale e lavorate fino a rendere l'impasto liscio ed omogeneo. Riponetelo a lievitare per circa 20 ore. Realizzate una piega a tre e fatelo lievitare per altri 45-60 minuti. Ribaltatelo sul piano di lavoro e fate la formatura a filone, schiacciate un po' il panetto formando un rettangolo, prendete la parte superiore e portandola verso la parte centrale del panetto, cominciate ad arrotolare sigillando la chiusura. Fatelo lievitare in uno stampo da plumcake per 60 minuti, deve appena raddoppiare. Preriscaldate il forno a 220°C , infornate il pane e cuocetelo per 45-50 minuti.

Gobernador mexicano dice que los “pobres” son inmunes al coronavirus

Big 12 commissioner Bob Bowlsby fielded questions for nearly an hour Thursday, but from the outset he didn't profess to have all the answers.
   
 Speaking at a news teleconference that covered a litany of topics yet centered around the dark cloud the coronavirus has cast over a conference that houses Kansas, Kansas State and eight other high-profile universities, Bowlsby emphasized the cautious approach the Big 12 has taken amid these uncertain times.
   
 "I guess we have the same questions that all of you have," Bowlsby said in his opening statement. "When do we return to normalcy, or some semblance of normalcy? Is it going to be May? Is it going to be June? Could it be July? Will we see a second cycle (of the virus) sometime down the road?"
   
 The Big 12 shut down its men's and women's basketball tournaments March 12 in Kansas City, Mo., and just a day later, the conference canceled its spring sport seasons. Bowlsby labeled the current "unprecedented times" as "extraordinary" but made sure to put his role and the role of sports in general into context.
   
 "The reach of this goes way beyond athletics," Bowlsby said, "and in some ways athletics gets rendered to an appropriate second-class citizenship as a result of all that's going on in our world."
   
 Bowlsby's own world has looked much different of late.
   
 The Dallas-based commissioner has been working from home, 12-hour, teleconference-packed days full of daily meetings with other major conference commissioners, twice-weekly meetings with Big 12 athletic directors, and frequent calls with NCAA officials.
   
 Bowlsby's time hasn't simply been consumed by coronavirus discussions.
   
 "It might surprise you to hear that the name, image and likeness components that I've been involved with throughout (the) NCAA working group are continuing to move forward," said Bowlsby, who still expects to be part of a report on that subject matter to the NCAA board of governors by the end of April -- by telephone, of course.
   
 Bowlsby also outlined the financial impact of the virus-related cancellations. The axed men's and women's basketball tournaments will cost the conference about $6.6 million. The NCAA's decision to significantly lessen its distribution to conferences -- down to $225 million from a previous total of approximately $600 million -- has trimmed the Big 12's expected cut of the pie to $10 million, down from the typical $24 million.
   
 "We're going to take some hits there," acknowledged Bowlsby, who added the conference is still determining the financial impact of reductions in TV and sponsorship payments for spring sports.
   
 The picture isn't entirely bleak -- Bowlsby cited Oklahoma's appearance in the College Football Playoff, an approximate $3.5 million savings in membership participation subsidies and somewhere between $2.5 to $5 million in budget variants from not hosting conference championships as funds that could help offset the losses.
   
 Those factors, in addition to substantial cash saved in an operating reserve, gives Bowlsby certainty that the Big 12 will be able to honor its upcoming payments to member institutions. That said, the hypothetical of a delayed or lost fall football season would bring about "major changes" that could send shockwaves throughout the entire Power Five landscape.
   
 Bowlsby said no consideration has been given at this time to contingency plans that would be enacted if the cash cow of football is indeed wiped away by a second surge in the coronavirus, though he said the next 60 to 90 days should provide clarity. That statement rings true whether football runs as scheduled, is delayed or canceled, or returns with a much different look -- Bowlsby threw out the possibility of fans sitting six feet apart, or crowds banned altogether.
   
 "I think there probably will be lots of people that give consideration to what kind of public assembly they want to do," Bowlsby said. "… I do think it will cause people to take pause and wonder what kinds of things they're sharing other than enthusiasm for a game and enthusiasm for a school or a team when they go into a stadium."
   
 Echoing remarks made last week by KU athletic director Jeff Long, Bowlsby called the uncertainty of what lies ahead "unnerving."
   
 "I remember the time period after 9/11. That one was awfully difficult on our nation and yet you little by little saw returns to normalcy after three or four days and then after 10 days and then after a month," Bowlsby said. "This just has a much longer tail. It has a great deal more uncertainty. It's an invisible enemy that we really don't know fully how to fight it.
   
 "I just think it's very presumptuous to try and force athletics decisions into an environment that's so uncertain and so universal in its impact in our society. I just think we all have to stand back and recognize that we're managing important games, but they're just games. It's that context I think that's kind of helped me to stay focused and think about these things in ways that are perhaps a little different than we might have in the past."
   
 Bowlsby indicated opinions from Big 12 athletic directors and CEOs on an extra year of eligibility for winter and spring athletes remains mixed, though the former college wrestler stressed it is a "heartbreaking" situation for the those individuals whose final seasons and postseasons were wiped away. The same is true for Olympic athletes who, after taking a gap year away from collegiate competition, face their own period of limbo.
   
 "This probably should cause us all to ponder what's really important in college athletics and perhaps indeed in our life beyond college athletics," Bowlsby said. "When you're up against an opponent like we are, I think you begin to treasure some of the things you take for granted."
   
 Bowlsby classified this time period as "intellectually fascinating and challenging."
   
 "This is a new day, and I think it's going to have to be almost entirely dictated by the circumstances once those circumstances are known," Bowlsby said, "because right now I don't think there's a crystal ball on the planet that can tell us what's going to happen in the coming months."

University of Missouri System President Mun Choi assumed the duties of chancellor of the Columbia campus Thursday after Alexander Cartwright resigned to be president of the University of Central Florida.


   


  The Board of Curators voted unanimously in a closed session Wednesday to combine the duties of the two offices -- at least on an interim basis -- a news release from the university stated.


   


  Cartwright's last day at the university was Wednesday.


   


  There will be no immediate search for a replacement, the release said. Instead, the curators will consider whether to make the arrangement permanent.


   


  "We are taking this action to maintain critical leadership at Mizzou and its continued excellence among the nation's leading research institutions," Julia Brncic, board chair, said in the release. "During this time of unprecedented challenges, it is important that our continuity of proven leadership is enabled for swift and efficient actions that benefit our students, faculty, staff and communities."


   


  The curators believe Choi has led the system and its four universities through several transformative projects, the release said, citing the NextGen Precision Health Initiative, an expansion of online learning, and finding efficiencies across the system.


   


  "I am committed to ensuring continuity of leadership at Mizzou at a time when partnership and collaboration among all four of our universities is more essential than ever -- not only for our institutions, but also for our state," Choi said in the release.


   


  How long Choi will have the combined roles depends on whether it seems to be the correct way to organize the university, Brncic and Choi said during an online conversation with reporters.


   


  Choi will delegate some of the responsibilities of each job to others and concentrate on priorities, he said.


   


  "The board will tell me how I am doing in that regard," he said.


   


  State Rep. Kip Kendrick, D-Columbia, said he sees the move as a reaction to the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 outbreak.


   


  "It makes a lot of sense, especially in this time of uncertainty, to consolidate the two positions and then re-evaluate them down the road once we return to more normal times," he said.


   


  The appointment is effective immediately. Choi's salary will not change as a result of the new appointment, the release stated.


   


  Choi, who has been president of the UM System since March 2017, will be the first president to also have direct authority over the Columbia campus since the creation of the university system in 1963.


   


  At UCF, Cartwright will be paid a salary of $600,000 a year, with a total compensation package worth about $1 million annually for five years, the Orlando Sentinel reported.


   


  At MU, Cartwright was paid $485,000 a year and gave up deferred compensation potentially worth $125,000 by leaving before he had been chancellor for five years.


   


  Choi is paid $530,000 a year as UM System president.


   


  The move by Cartwright was a surprise, Brncic said. The chancellor had been on campus since August 2017 and had a seemingly good relationship with Choi.


   


  There has often been tension between past presidents, who work out of University Hall off Stadium Boulevard, and Columbia campus chancellors, who work in Jesse Hall. The tension was on very public display in November 2015, when Chancellor R. Bowen Loftin and President Tim Wolfe both lost their jobs in the same day.


   


  Choi, 56, was provost at the University of Connecticut when he was selected in the fall of 2016. In an interview in August 2017, Choi said he wanted to remain in Columbia for 10 years or longer, which would also be a first since the system was formed.


   


  He said a similar thing about the need for stability in the chancellor's office when Cartwright was hired.


   


  While he and Cartwright had professional differences, Choi said, they got along personally, he said.


   


  "Our public persona is one of collaboration," Choi said. "In any organization that has two top leaders, there are going to be professional disagreements."


   


  Those disagreements did not take place in public, Brncic said.


   


  "There was never any visible tension between the two in front of the board," she said.


   


  During a Board of Curators discussion in 2018, a consultant told members that the University of Missouri has a hybrid system that calls the Columbia campus a flagship but does not follow a pure flagship model.


   


  Terry McTaggart of the Association of Governing Boards of Universities and Colleges, said that in a system defined as a flagship model, the job of overall university leadership and leadership of the main campus are combined.


   


  Defining the role and relationship of the MU chancellor and the system president was an important part of the work done during the search that selected Choi, Curator Jon Sundvold said during that meeting.


   


  "I will send out a warning," he said. "Since I have been there since 1979, there has always been some issue between that campus chancellor and the president."


   


  The Columbia campus, along with colleges and universities nationwide, has sent students home to help control spread of the novel coronavirus that emerged last year. The university is attempting to maintain education via online instruction, which will resume when spring break ends Monday.


   


  At the same time, the university has made major financial commitments that of a type it has not made in the past.


   


  The university is building its first research building in nearly two decades and doing so by issuing revenue bonds pledging the revenues of both the university and MU Health Care. In the past, the university used revenue bonds to build facilities such as residence halls.


   


  The NextGen Precision Health Institute is currently under construction at an estimated cost of $221 million.


   


  In coming months, if the pandemic eases, it will leave in its wake an economy in need of rebuilding.


   


  The plunge in the value of stocks and other securities, which produce income that supports scholarships, professorships and research, could result in a substantial shortfall. It could also hamper the university's ability to keep up with its retirement promises, requiring a larger share of payroll to maintain investments.


   


  Higher education, which is funded from state general revenue and proceeds from casinos and the lottery, could also face significant state budget cuts as income taxes and sales tax revenue plunges.


   


  Kendrick, the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee, said the uncertainty of when federal aid will arrive and the decision to delay tax filing means the state is facing a large shortfall by June 30. Higher education often takes some of the biggest cuts when withholdings occur, he noted.


   


  "In the short term, one of my biggest concerns is how the state of Missouri handles the obvious cash-flow issue we will have for the remainder of Fiscal Year 20," he said.


   


  The economic destruction wrought by the need to control the contagion is also likely to impact the ability of students to pay for tuition and housing, leading to a likely drop in enrollment just as the campus was recovering from a crash in 2016 and 2017 related to protests in 2015.


   


  The NextGen building will be completed on time and staff with top researchers, Choi promised.


   


  The university must prepare for the coming months of stress, he said.


   


  "The next few months are going to reveal some very significant financial challenges for this university and other universities," he said. "The new normal will be here, but we don't know what that new normal looks like."

The two companies have also filed for FDA approval of Reblozyl as a treatment for patients with very low-to-intermediate risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) with ring sideroblasts who require regular red blood cell transfusions. A disease of the bone marrow, MDS causes the body to create poorly formed or non-functioning red blood cells. The FDA's Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) decision deadline is quickly approaching on April 4. In December, the FDA informed Acceleron that a previously scheduled advisory meeting to discuss the drug would not be necessary. Stay tuned to see if the FDA weighs in on this or pushes out the deadline in light of the current coronavirus pandemic.

“Bisogna intervenire tempestivamente – conclude il senatore – per evitare le speculazioni, la contrazione della produzione e quindi il tracollo dell’intero settore zootecnico italiano. E’ necessario che vengano rispettati i tempi di pagamento, in modo da essere davvero di aiuto a tutti i produttori. E’ inoltre opportuno che nei Decreti legge vengano inserite misure ad hoc nei confronti delle aziende agricole ed in via prioritaria per tutte le partite iva italiane che soffrono. Molte delle nostre aziende infatti sono a conduzione familiare e in questo momento hanno ancora più difficoltà con le banche: evitiamo di destinare risorse per le imprese estere in Tunisia o altrove. Dobbiamo agire al più presto per fermare questa ingiustizia verso un settore che oggi è più che mai vitale per tutti noi e per la nostra economia”.

Jailed every night over a zoning infraction, Seth Reynolds this week asked the court to let him serve home detention temporarily because of the coronavirus.


   


  In response, Boone County attorney C.J. Dykhouse wants to have him jailed 24/7.


   


  Reynolds is incarcerated overnight daily in defiance of an order to demolish his fence and shed, which Circuit Judge Jodie Asel found violated local zoning laws.


   


  Reynolds has already served more than 300 days for the non-criminal offense. He is concerned with spreading the virus to other detainees and jail staff, as well as contracting it himself.


   


  Others in the community are concerned over the county's actions in forcing him to travel in and out of the facility. A former circuit judge and a local attorney have asked the county to release Reynolds until the pandemic subsides.


   


  Dykhouse is adamant Reynolds be jailed over the non-criminal offense of defying Asel's shed and fence removal order. He did not respond to a phone call to his office or an email seeking comment.


   


  In a motion filed Thursday, he asked Asel to consider jailing Reynolds around the clock until the stay-at-home order is rescinded.


   


  "Defendant has testified in this matter that he is self-employed at his Eye Candy shop, a smoke shop in downtown Columbia," Dykhouse wrote in the motion. "This shop is not an essential business and, therefore, must be closed for the duration of the stay-at-home order."


   


  Reynolds' attorney, Steve Wyse, alleged the matter is a personal vendetta on the part of Dykhouse. In the past, the county attorney has said jailing Reynolds would send a message to residents not to test zoning enforcement.


   


  "This is probably the most outrageous and vindictive government action I have ever seen," Wyse said.


   


  Wyse filed a motion seeking temporary home detention in the matter on Wednesday and cited how corrections facilities across the country are releasing low-level offenders in response to the pandemic.


   


  The jail has halted visitations and all civilian entry, with the exception of essential personnel.


   


  Presiding county commissioner Dan Atwill has not returned calls or emails seeking comment.


   


  The courts are operating on restrictions in an effort not to endanger the public or staff, so there is no timeline for Asel to issue a ruling on the opposing motions.

  Columbia and Boone County are under a stay-at-home order that took effect at 8 a.m. Wednesday and Gov. Mike Parson is seeking a declaration from President Donald Trump that the state is a major disaster area.


   


  The number of coronavirus infections continued to climb dramatically on Wednesday, up 101 statewide to 356 people. There is at least one confirmed infection in 40 of the 116 local health department jurisdictions around the state.


   


  Boone County, which had the state's first death, discovered community spread of the disease on Monday. The county's count of confirmed cases climbed to 24 on Wednesday.


   


  Working in an occupation exempted from the Boone County stay-at-home order, Brown is also trying to limit his contacts.


   


  With online shopping the only kind available, he expects to get busier.


   


  "In a sense it is job security, but at the same time it is kind of crazy," Brown said. "Everywhere I go, they are checking my temperature."


   


  Parson filed for the federal disaster declaration to provide help to individuals, government agencies, businesses and not-for-profit groups struggling to cope with the pandemic.


   


  "The COVID-19 pandemic has already had a devastating effect on the state of Missouri, straining hospitals, healthcare facilities and nursing homes, businesses large and small, schools, and tens of thousands of Missourians who have been forced out of their jobs," Parson said in a news release.


   


  At his daily briefing Wednesday, Parson didn't address the increase, but again defended his decision to hold off on issuing a stay-at-home order.


   


  Parson's current emergency order limits gatherings to 10 people and encourages everyone who can stay home to do so. He acknowledged that he has critics, but said the goal is to protect people.


   


  "Everybody has a different idea of how that is to be done," he said. "I will say this, at the end of the day, there will be plenty of time to second-guess who done what, and why they done it.


   


  "But right now there is no doubt in my mind, that people in this country, the industrial might of our country, our leadership, are all trying to do one thing right now, and that is to take care of the citizens in every state," Parson said.


   


  Part of his daily briefing is an update on efforts by the Department of Public Safety to obtain the protective gear under extreme demand.


   


  Director Sandy Karsten said Parson freed another $10 million from other state accounts to cover new orders.


   


  In the vital farming sector, Agriculture Department Director Chris Chinn said every step in bringing food to depleted stores is essential. With planting season approaching, it is vital that farmers have the supplies of seed and feed they need.


   


  "We in agriculture are working around the clock to make sure those shelves get restocked," she said.


   


  The veteran from Pulaski County admitted to Truman Memorial Veterans Hospital is still being treated there, spokesman Jeffrey Hoelscher wrote in an email. No employees have tested positive.


   


  At Boone Hospital Center, which has tested 395 people through early Wednesday, hospital spokeswoman Madison Loethen declined to say whether any patients are being treated there.


   


  At University of Missouri Health Care, where almost 1,100 people have been tested since drive-through testing began, spokesman Eric Maze wrote that a special area has been prepared.


   


  "We have a designated unit to care for patients who need to be hospitalized for COVID-19 operated by staff trained to handle these cases," he wrote.


   


  Counties added Wednesday to the state's list where infections have been found include Cape Girardeau in southeast Missouri and Newton in southwest Missouri.


   


  The most cases are in St. Louis County, with 119 confirmed infections, followed by St. Louis with 44 and Kansas City with 43.


   


  One of the new cases is a youth at the Hogan Street Regional Youth Center in St. Louis, the state Division of Youth Services said Tuesday evening.


   


  The division learned of the positive test Monday evening, according to a news release. A local hospital evaluated the male youth and said the resident could recover at the center.


   


  Division of Youth Services "staff immediately quarantined and isolated the youth upon his return to safeguard the health of all other youth in care at Hogan Street," the release said.


   


  The division did not disclose the patient's name and age. It said staff were contacting parents of other residents "to advise them of the situation and what steps DYS is taking to protect the safety and health of their child."


   


  Approximately 45 percent of the state's population lives in locations that have issued stay-at-home orders. Along with Boone County, areas under those orders are Randolph County in central Missouri and Clay, Jackson, Greene and St. Louis counties and the city of St. Louis.


   


  All school districts in the state are closed and will not reopen until at least early April under state orders for social distancing issued by Parson.


   


  Nationally, there are 20 states that have issued stay-at-home orders. The number of known infections in the United States grew more than 20 percent Wednesday, to 65,778, with 926 deaths.


   


  Worldwide, the novel coronavirus that emerged late last year has infected 467,594 people, with 21,162 deaths blamed on the disease.


   


  The death rate, 3.4 percent early in the pandemic, has climbed to 4.5 percent.


   


  In the request to declare Missouri a major disaster, Parson is seeking Disaster Unemployment Assistance and Crisis Counseling, under the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Individual Assistance Program, which provides assistance to individuals and families.


   


  Families need both financial and emotional support during the pandemic, the release stated.


   


  Parson also requested FEMA's Public Assistance Program for local governments and qualifying not-for-profit agencies with emergency response expenses, including those of first responders. He also requested that FEMA assist with debris removal expenses if needed for the removal and disposal of bio-hazard and other contaminated materials as a result of the pandemic response.

By becoming an investor in a business, an individual has engaged in an entrepreneurial activity. He has committed his capital with a view to supply the most urgent needs of consumers. For an entrepreneur, the ultimate criteria for investing his capital is to employ it in those activities which will produce goods and services that are on the highest priority list of consumers. It is this striving to satisfy the most urgent needs of consumers that produce profits, and it is this alone that guides entrepreneurs.4
 Is it valid to argue that past information is completely embedded in prices and therefore of no consequence? It is questionable whether the market participants can discount the duration and the strength of effects of various causes.
 For instance, a market-anticipated lowering of interest rates by the central bank, while being regarded as old news and therefore not supposed to have real effects, will in fact set in motion the process of the boom-bust cycle. In addition, various causes once set in motion, initially only affect some individuals' real income. As time goes by however, the effect of these causes spreads across a wider spectrum of individuals.
 Obviously, these changes in the real incomes of individuals will lead to changes in the relative prices of assets. To suggest, then, that somehow the market will quickly incorporate all future changes of various present causes without telling us how it is done is questionable.
 It has to be realized that markets are comprised of individual investors who require time to understand the implications of various causes and their implications for the prices of financial assets.
 Even if a particular cause was anticipated by the market that does not mean it was understood correctly and therefore discounted. It is hard to imagine that the effect of a particular cause, which begins with a few individuals and then spreads over time across many individuals, can be assessed and understood instantaneously.
 For this to be so, it would mean that market participants could immediately assess future consumers' responses and counter responses to a given cause. This, of course, must mean that market participants not only must know consumers' preferences but also how these preferences are going to change. Note though, consumer preferences cannot be revealed before consumers have acted.

PORTSMOUTH With travel restrictions and advisories recently outlined in an emergency ordinance for Block Island, will travel to and from Prudence Island undergo similar changes in light of COVID-19 concerns?
   
 Other than a request that all out-of-state visitors and seasonal residents self-quarantine for two weeks upon arrival to Portsmouth, "[w]e are not taking any other specific action [with] Prudence," Town Administrator Richard Rainer said in an email to The Daily News on Thursday.
   
 With Block Island, "there's a commercial component out there," Town Council President Kevin Aguiar told The Daily News on Thursday, when asked if similar restrictions would be placed on Prudence Island.
   
 Rainer reiterated Aguiar's point in an email: "Other than a small store, there is no commercial activity on [Prudence Island] almost everyone visiting are either [full-time] or [part-time] residents."
   
 "They're property owners [and] it' hard to restrict them," Aguiar added. "If you're going [to Prudence Island, we ask that you] be safe."
   
 The population on Prudence Island is seasonally variable; between 100 and 150 people live there in the winter. The maximum summer population is approximately 800 people, The Daily News reported previously.
   
 "I'd say it's pretty much business as usual," Ed Aldrich, a Prudence Island resident, told The Daily News on Wednesday when asked his observations on the general mood of the island. "We tend to keep to ourselves."
   
 The Prudence Island Ferry remains in service, according to the Prudence & Bay Islands Transport website on Thursday.
   
 "Prudence & Bay Islands Transport will continue to operate our normal schedule as the lifeline service between Bristol and Prudence Island unless directed to cancel or modify service by state or federal authorities," the website says. According to a March 25 newsletter posted by the ferry company, certain changes like a 10-person per cabin limit have been enacted in light of COVID-19 concerns.

The special teams formed in Thanjavur district to identify and monitor the health condition and movement of the persons who had returned from foreign countries have expedited the exercise since Thanjavur district topped the list with most number of foreign returnees among the eight districts of Central Tamil Nadu


  As per the list provided by the Immigration Department, a total of 4961 persons have landed at the airports in the country on March 1 and on later dates and reached their native places in Thanjavur district.


  The list was provided to the 1,183 teams formed based on the number of public distribution shops in the district, in order to ensure that all those living in the jurisdiction of the respective PDS outlets were covered without fail, have intensified their efforts.


  These teams have started calling on the families of such persons to enquire about the health condition of the foreign returnees and as well as those residing in those houses, official sources said.


  As part of the exercise, the foreign returnees have been stamped for self- quarantine even though they do not suffer from COVID-19 symptoms.


  ## Stamping objected


  While officials justified their action of stamping foreign returnees by claiming that it would help monitor their movement, relatives of some of the foreign returnees such as Balan of Salai Street, Kumbakonam, opposed the action by stating that such a measure causes mental agony not only for the person but also for the individual’s family members. Stamping a healthy person was unwarranted, he said.


  Meanwhile, a woman who returned from Singapore was spotted along with her mother at Melavasal near Mannargudi in Tiruvarur district on Thursday.


  According to sources, the 44-year old woman hailing from a hamlet near Vaduvur had returned from Singapore on March 13 against the advice of her husband. She went to her relative’s house at Alakudi in Thanjavur taluk instead of going to her house and stayed at Alakudi till March 25.


  She left Alakudi on March 26 after her relatives had asked her to return to her house in view of the COVID-19 virus scare. But instead of proceeding to her house, she called up her mother, and started searching for a house at Melavasal hamlet.


  As their replies were not convincing, the residents who the women approached for rental accommodation grew suspicious and informed the Mannargudi police.


  On interrogation, the woman admitted that she had returned from Singapore and she was stamped for self-quarantine. She was sent home by the officials.

The Tiruchi Railway Division has been moving essential commodities especially paddy and rice by rail despite the lock down enforced to contain the COVID-19 pandemic.


  In the last four days from March 23, the division loaded 9,480 metric tonnes of rice and 6,766 metric tonnes of paddy.


  Besides essential commodities, it had also loaded 62,577 metric tonnes of coal to various power houses which include the Mettur thermal power plant and the ILFS power plant at Pudhuchathiram from Karaikal Port.


  The division had also loaded 28,980 metric tonnes of lignite from Vadalur to Uthangalmangalam where the TAQA power company is situated.


  Railway sources said the Tiruchi division would be taking all steps to ensure uninterrupted movement of all essential commodities.


  Meanwhile, the Tiruchi Railway Division has fully closed six broad gauge sections falling under its jurisdiction till April 14 as a temporary measure.


  The divisional railway administration had sent a communication in this regard on Wednesday to the field-level railway personnel working in those sections. The broad gauge sections which have been fully closed were: Tiruvarur - Karaikudi, Karaikal - Nagore, Nagapattinam -Velankanni, Nidamangalam - Mannargudi, Kurinjipadi - Cuddalore Port and Villupuram - Puducherry.


  A senior railway official said the sections were closed since no freight operations by rail were taking places on these stretches. Whenever there was a requirement, the sections would be opened at a short notice, the official added.


  However, the station masters have been asked to visit the respective station/ traffic level crossings every day to ensure that all railway assets were in proper order.


  In the Tiruvarur - Karaikudi section via Pattukottai, Peravurani and Aranthangi only one DEMU (Diesel Electric Multiple Unit) train was being operated until recently with mobile gatekeepers on board ever since the stretch was converted from metre gauge to broad gauge.


  Although the railway administration had completely stopped operation of passenger trains in all sections, it was operating freight trains for movement of essential commodities.


  The Tiruchi Railway Division has also communicated that there would be restricted operations in the Villupuram - Katpadi, Villupuram - Cuddalore - Alapakkam and Thanjavur - Mayiladuthurai broad gauge sections with single shift from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. The chord line section from Tiruchi Junction to Villupuram via Ariyalur and Vriddhachalam continued to remain open round-the- clock for operation of freight trains.


  Southern Railway administration has also instructed that the freight trains should run at a maximum speed not exceeding 50 kilometre per hour in all sections in its jurisdiction.


  Further, only a minimum number of personnel should be called for freight trains operations to move essential commodities. A senior official said the railways were ready to transport essential commodities whenever required at short notice.


  Railway sources said all traffic staff were asked to be readily available on mobile phone at all times to attend to any emergency duty. Railway personnel have also been asked to maintain personal hygiene.

Notice that, although Virginia’s statute defines a class of “unorganized militia”, it does _not_ describe this class as being “unarmed”, “disarmed”, or in any other manner prohibited, prevented, or otherwise precluded—or capable of being prohibited, prevented, or otherwise precluded—from “keep[ing] and bear[ing] arms” suitable for service in the Militia. As the Constitution of the United States plainly shows in the power of Congress “[t]o provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the Militia” (Article I, Section 8, Clause 16), “organizing”, “arming”, and “disciplining” are distinct categories of authority and action. Therefore, a statute which declares some class of the Militia to be “unorganized” does not thereby imply that the members of that class are to remain “unarmed”, let alone that they are to be disarmed of whatever arms, whether of all types or only of certain types, they already possess, or to be prohibited from acquiring such arms in the free market. This, of course, makes perfect logistical sense, because it would self- evidently be far easier to organize into various units citizens who were already armed than to provide actual arms to citizens who happened merely to be already assigned on paper to such units.

No one knew it then, but it was the last time the Bulls were a respected force in the competition. It was the Brumbies that delivered the death knell to a crumbling Bulls empire. Ironically, seven years on, it will be White who has to pick up the pieces of the once great franchise in his new role as Director of Rugby.

 As the new coronavirus spreads, it has exposed a variety of societal vulnerabilities. For example, giant cities have seen how their long-touted lifestyle -- packing more and more people into less and less space -- can endanger public health.
 Those in more rural settings shouldn't feel smug, however. Those sprinkled among the countryside of Kansas are in some ways even less prepared than those in urban areas. The lack of hospital facilities and emergency services is the first gap that comes to mind.
 But there's another shortcoming, one that has been highlighted for years and will only make this experience more difficult. That's the lack of broadband internet access.
 How might that make this current crisis worse? There are several ways. First, with schools across the state closed, educators are moving their classes online. Students in rural areas were already disadvantaged without broadband, but if education itself is primarily dispensed online, where does this leave them?
 That's not all. Routine doctor's visits are shifting toward telemedicine, which is perhaps ill-named. It's more accurately described as video- conferencing medicine. Again, without the support of broadband internet, online meetings with your doctor will be all but impossible for rural folks. And with rural hospitals dwindling, that access was already precarious to begin with.
 Finally, this is a rapidly changing, historical event. Yet because of social distancing requirements, we are largely experiencing it alone. Social media and other online tools can bring us closer together, if only virtually. Again, lack of broadband makes that challenging.
 So what's the answer? The Legislature has repeatedly talked about this problem, but we haven't seen decisive action yet.
 Internet providers, which are interested in making a profit, don't see a sustainable business in the miles upon miles of fields and tiny towns of rural Kansas.
 Once this crisis passes -- and it will pass -- lawmakers will need to solve this problem once and for all. Do providers need incentives? Will some sort of public-private partnership need to be created? Surely the problem has solutions, if all sides work toward them in good faith.
 What's unacceptable is seeing rural areas once again being left behind during a time of great social change. These communities, and these residents, are no more or less Kansans than the rest of us.
 They deserve access to the same utility services -- and that's what broadband internet is, make no mistake -- as the rest of us.

MS Dhoni's much-anticipated comeback with the IPL may not happen anytime soon in light of the fast-spreading COVID-19 pandemic but his childhood coach Keshav Ranjan Banerjee remains hopeful that the ageing cricketing hero will find a place in India's T20 World Cup.The lucrative T20 tournament's 2020 edition, which had already been postponed to April 15, is on the verge of cancellation with the country in a 21-day national lockdown beginning Wednesday to combat the spread of coronavirus.
 Dhoni has been out of action since India's semifinal exit in the World Cup in July last year.
 "In the current scenario, IPL looks unlikely and we will have to wait for BCCI's call. His (Dhoni's) position will become tough obviously. But my sixth sense says he will get a chance in the T20 World Cup, which will be his last," Banerjee told PTI from Ranchi.
 The Chennai Super Kings captain trained in Ranchi in the lead up to IPL 2020 and also led their training camp in Chennai before the league was postponed due to the outbreak of coronavirus.
 "I spoke to him last after he returned from Chennai and I'm in constant touch with his parents. He's doing his fitness training and is fully fit.
 "Now let's wait for the BCCI's decision. There's no tournament. ICC tournaments are off till June. So we will have to wait and see."
 Head coach Ravi Shastri had earlier said the IPL would decide the fate of Dhoni, who will turn 39 in July.
 But with IPL about to get shelved this year, the Indian greats including that of Sunil Gavaskar and Virender Sehwag, had raised a question mark on the return of the 2011 World Cup winning skipper.
 "True that he has not played a tournament (since July 2019) but for someone with 538 International matches, I don't think it would take much time to adjust."
 "It would have been a different scenario for a beginner. But it's not the case with Dhoni he has got a wealth of experience. I think he will get a last chance," maintained Banerjee.
 "He is fully fit and trained in Chennai for a week or so. Now everything is closed in Ranchi, earlier he would train at the JSCA. But now he's confined at home and making use of the facilities at home. He has a gym, a badminton court, and a running corridor."
 "I'm sure BCCI (presient, selectors, captain) are aware of the scenario. They will make the announcement when it's the right time," Banerjee added.

Manufacturing of nitrogen fertilizers involves use of magnesium nitrate hexahydrate, as the compound is a rich source of nitrogen. Growing requirement for nitrogen fertilizers in tandem with the steadily growing agricultural sector will continue to fuel growth of the magnesium nitrate hexahydrate market. The Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) states that demand for nitrogen fertilizers across the globe has remained significant in recent years, with sales estimated to close in on 119,418,000 tons by 2018-end. Given such robust sales of nitrogen fertilizers, growth of the magnesium nitrate hexahydrate market will continue to surge in the foreseeable future.

El seleccionador español, Luis Enrique Martínez, se ha mostrado ambicioso y convencido de poder llevar a cabo el reto de hacer ganadora a España de otra Eurocopa o de otro Mundial, si bien cree que están en «otra situación» respecto a la de 2010 en Sudáfrica, donde se agrupó la «mejor generación» del fútbol nacional.


  «¿Ganar dos o tres títulos? Lo que hemos vivido es claramente la mejor generación de jugadores de la historia del fútbol español. Todos tenían un nivel 'top' y en sus mejores edades. Nos toca coger el relevo, otra situación», comentó en una rueda de prensa con aficionados a través de una red social.


  No obstante, aseguró que ve a la selección «capacitada para ganar». «Me lo he planteado como reto y no lo he escondido nunca, pero es evidente que estamos dentro de un proceso en el que hay selecciones más hechas, como Francia, y otras con un potencial tremendo. Pero formamos parte del grupo de selecciones que pueden optar a ello», celebró.


  Además, aseguró que está todavía desarrollando el modelo que les debe llevar a conquistar esos títulos. «He tenido una evolución muy grande. He ido evolucionando, desarrollando mi modelo de juego a lo largo de estos años buscando lo que me hacía sentir mejor como entrenador y consideraba que era mejor para llegar al éxito. Me siento muy orgulloso de lo conseguido hasta ahora pero soy muy ambicioso y espero conseguir muchas más cosas», auguró.


  Preguntado sobre esa Euro que se debía disputar este año y que finalmente, por el coronavirus, tendrá lugar en 2021, aseguró que ve «bien» al grupo, en el que podría haber novedades. «Veo bien al equipo. Se ha pospuesto todo hasta 2021 pero ser seleccionador tiene cosas muy positivas, porque los jugadores vienen contentos, todos, y con ganas de ayudar y de participar», aseguró.


  Además, jugarán como locales en San Mamés. «Cada vez que he ido al nuevo San Mamés y antes al de toda la vida el ambiente siempre ha sido bestial. Estoy seguro de que será un ambiente muy potente, en uno de los estadios más bonitos de Europa y la afición seguro que va a estar con nosotros. Vamos a intentar que sea como cuando juegue el Athletic, y que nos lleven en volandas», comentó sobre el ambiente que espera y desea.


  De sus inicios en la selección, en la primera etapa antes del 'parón' que provocó la enfermedad y fallecimiento de su hija, recuerda la alegría que se llevó cuando le ofrecieron el cargo. «Cuando me llamaron fue una alegría muy bestia», reconoció.


  «Fue justo después del Mundial de Rusia, estaba sin trabajar en ese momento y me dijeron que querían entrevistarse conmigo y llegamos a un acuerdo muy rápido. Es una cosa que me había hecho siempre mucha ilusión. Lo tenía claro, me apetecía, me apetece y espero estar muchos años aquí», auguró.


  Poco amante de dar pistas sobre sus seleccionados, sí respondió, a pregunta directa, sobre la posibilidad de ver al 'león' Iñaki Williams de rojo. «Es un gran delantero, joven, y puede venir. Estoy encantado de que haya cada vez más jugadores que se puedan incorporar», manifestó.


  Williams no encaja demasiado en el estilo de juego actual, aunque iría bien para tener un 'plan B' de correr al contraataque. «No hay ningún motivo que evite que podamos hacer un gol de contragolpe. En algún momento espero que lo podamos hacer. Pero nuestro estilo no es el de dar el balón al rival y esperar. Somos un equipo más técnico. Seguiremos jugando bien al fútbol a través del balón, creemos que es la clave», aportó el técnico.


  ## PUERTA ABIERTA A VOLVER AL BARÇA


  Por otro lado, reconoció que ha tenido la suerte de no cerrar ninguna puerta de vuelta en los clubes en los que ha estado y, preguntado por si volvería a entrenar a alguno de ellos, dejó entrever que sus mejores momentos los vivió entre el ya derruido Miniestadi y el Camp Nou.


  «He tenido siempre suerte en todos los equipos en que he estado, he dejado las puertas abiertas y podría volver a entrenar a cualquiera de ellos. Pero mi etapa en el Barça B y en el Barça fue maravillosa y siempre les voy a estar agradecido», se sinceró.


  En el Barça, además, entrenó al jugador que más le ha impresionado. «El jugador que más me ha impresionado es sin ninguna duda Leo Messi. Podría decir que Andrés Iniesta está muy cerca de algo parecido a Messi, pero Messi tiene una gran diferencia respecto a los demás», aportó.

Former Missouri football star Brock Olivo paints an eerie picture of what the coronavirus looks like in one of the countries most afflicted by the pandemic.


   


  Olivo, who for two weeks has been quarantined in Italy after recently moving there, has loved ones there, including his girlfriend and 10-year-old daughter, and they are all healthy. Yet the country is on lockdown to prevent the further spread of COVID-19.


   


  According to the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention, Italy has suffered the most coronavirus-related deaths of any nation in the world (8,165 as of Thursday morning), nearly doubling Spain, the country with the second- most. Italy is second to China in total cases but is expected to surpass China within days.


   


  Only San Marino, a tiny sovereign nation which Italy completely surrounds, has more deaths per its population than the country where Olivo currently resides.


   


  The 43-year-old Olivo has been in Italy since Feb. 14, according to Brad Biggs of the Chicago Tribune. Four days later, the country's first case of the virus was confirmed. Despite the growing pandemic, Olivo said he is healthy and has not required testing.


   


  Olivo described what he's seen in recent weeks as "unreal."


   


  "Little by little, the Italian government has been putting restrictions on social movement and now they are to the point where the entire country is under quarantine," Olivo said in an interview with the Chicago Tribune. "The only retail that is open are pharmacies and grocery stores, but they are open with only limited hours. You can leave the house only for an emergency or to go grocery shopping, and only one person per household can go grocery shopping and it's limited to once a week. You can walk your dog, but you have to have a written permit on you at all times."


   


  "The government is considering passing a bill that will allow authorities to slap you a ticket for 4,000 Euros ($4,415) if you don't have a legitimate written permit on you," he continued, "because they have been way too lenient and there hasn't been enough enforcement and people just take advantage of it."


   


  Olivo said Italians are social and desire to be outdoors, making this period even more difficult. The restrictions may be in place until the end of July, he added.


   


  Olivo is a Hermann native and graduated from Missouri as the program's all- time leading rusher in 1997 with 3,026 yards. He's third on that list now, with Brad Smith and Zack Abron passing him after the turn of the millennium.


   


  Olivo was most recently an assistant special teams coach for the Chicago Bears, but he was not retained at the end of the 2019 season by Bears head coach Matt Nagy.


   


  Olivo previously coached alongside former Missouri assistant coach Dave Toub with the Kansas City Chiefs as an assistant special teams coach from 2014-16. Olivo also spent a season as the Denver Broncos' special teams coordinator in 2017.


   


  After graduating from MU, Olivo spent four seasons with the Detroit Lions as one of their top special teams players and a backup running back and fullback.


   


  Olivo recently joined the coaching staff of the Lazio Ducks, an American football team in Rome, the capital of Italy. The Ducks play in the country's highest classification of the sport. He serves as the special teams and secondary coach.


   


  Olivo told the Chicago Tribune over the phone that he doesn't regret staying in Italy after the virus began spreading.


   


  "I am going to be honest, no. My daughter is here, my girlfriend is here and I want to coach football and stay active in the game," Olivo said. "My only chance this year was here. I had exhausted all my opportunities in the States and I was going to kill two birds with one stone: be closer to my daughter and stay in the game of football that I love.


   


  "I really do not have any regrets at all. Being over here where it exploded so quickly, you understood the path of the thing. ... I will stay here where I am close to loved ones and wait it out and see what happens."
