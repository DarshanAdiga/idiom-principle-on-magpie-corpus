Wetherspoons has spent £15million kitting out its sites with safety measures, has an established way of putting in online orders – and has clearly seen a lot of people pass through its doors.
 But shares fell yesterday, by as much as 5 per cent, as Wetherspoons’ own figures on the coronavirus dovetailed with the start of new Covid-19 restrictions that cap the number of people who can socialise together in a group at six.
 The FTSE 250-listed group’s stock eventually pared back losses, closing down 1.4 per cent, or 12.5p, at 914p.
 Fellow watering-hole owner Brighton Pier Group had a very different start to the week.
 The small-cap company – which runs Brighton Palace Pier and a number of high- end bars – rose 9.8 per cent, or 3p, to 33.5p after it said trading had been much better than expected over the last 10 weeks. At its sites that have reopened, turnover is running at about 77 per cent of last year.
 And it is going to trial a format without live music at some of its usually DJ-led late-night venues – but said it still needs the Government to make it clear when it can properly restart the party.
 It was a mixed day on the wider market, with the FTSE 100 falling by 0.1 per cent, or 5.84 points, to 6026.25, as tensions ratcheted up over Brexit negotiations. The FTSE 250, in contrast, rose 0.7 per cent, or 121.39 points, to 17677.26.
 Footsie-listed Aviva was little moved by new chief executive Amanda Blanc putting her money where her mouth is and ploughing £1million into buying shares in the insurance provider.
 Blanc, who has been at Aviva’s helm since July, hoovered up 324,887 shares at around 300p each. She is attempting to restructure the group and revive its stock – a plan that has so far included offloading its Singapore business for £1.5billion.
 Despite the big gesture, shares fell 0.4 per cent, or 1.2p, to 302p.
 Landlord CLS climbed 0.7 per cent, or 1.5p, to 208.5p after it spent almost £60million buying three office sites in Greater London and the South East.
 But elsewhere in the property sector, housebuilder MJ Gleeson said profits had slumped by 86 per cent to just £5.6million as turnover fell 41 per cent to £147million.
 The swift closure of sites in the spring resulted in a sharp drop in sales in the year to June 30. Shares fell 2.3 per cent, or 14p, to 600p.
 And litigation funder Burford Capital rose 2.1 per cent, or 11.6p, to 576p after it got the green light to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange, in addition to its London listing.

The Philadelphia Eagles entered their Week 1 game against the Washington Football Team beset by injuries. They had already lost offensive line starters Brandon Brooks (torn Achilles) and Andre Dillard (torn pectoral) for the season, then had to play the opener without both right tackle Lane Johnson (ankle), starting running back Miles Sanders (hamstring), and edge rusher Derek Barnett (also hamstring).
 Those injuries up front decimated the Philadelphia offensive line, which was a recipe for disaster against the explosive Washington front. Chase Young, Montez Sweat, Jonathan Allen, Da'Ron Payne, Ryan Kerrigan, Matt Ioannidis, and Jon Bostic all hit home against Wentz, with Washington racking up eight sacks in the game, to go along with 13 tackles for loss and 15 quarterback hits. The Eagles ended up averaging just 4.2 yards per dropbacks.
 As if that weren't bad enough, the Eagles' own pass rush only hit home against Dwayne Haskins three times, and it also saw another important contributor go down. Edge rusher Vinny Curry suffered a hamstring injury during the loss, and according to a report from NFL.com, he will miss about four weeks. Brandon Graham also entered the concussion protocol, which means his status will be up in the air until he can pass an independent evaluation.
 Making matters worse, per Eagles beat writer Eliot Shorr-Parks, it sounds like no sure thing that either Johnson or Sanders will definitely be ready to go for Sunday's Week 2 matchup against the Rams, who just beat the Cowboys on Sunday Night Football. John Clark of NBC Sports adds that there is "decent hope" the pair will play, but that it will likely come down to a decision made toward the end of the week once again.

 # Amazon to hire 3,600 for new jobs in Michigan
 Candice Williams
 The Detroit News
 View Comments
 Amazon.com Inc. said Monday it is looking to hire 3,600 people to fill new jobs in its warehouses and delivery stations across Michigan, part of 100,000 positions the company is seeking to fill across the United States and Canada.
 The online retail giant's need for permanent full and part-time hires is a result of company growth, said Ofori Agboka, vice president of human resources for Global Customer Fulfillment at Amazon. There are currently 13,500 Amazon jobs in Michigan.
 “Our business model is predicated on customer demand and our customers want their product," he said. "And we’re fortunate and blessed to have this opportunity to be a job creator to employ people who are furloughed, laid off, military vets. Anybody that’s looking to do something different."
 The promise of new jobs comes as Michigan is struggling with the continuing aftershocks of the COVID-19 pandemic that has totaled more than 111,500 cases across the state and claimed nearly 6,600 lives. Michigan's jobless rate peaked in April at 22.7 percent, but has been receding in recent months as Gov. Gretchen Whitmer reopens more sectors of the state economy.
 Amazon's hiring announcement is good news for the Michigan economy, said Robert Dye, chief economist at Comerica Bank: "Amazon’s growth in these difficult times shows what economists mean by 'creative destruction.'
 "Recessions, including the one we are in now, are periods of rapid change in the economy. Amazon is clearly on the favorable side of the accelerated creative destruction that we are now seeing in the economy. Amazon’s expansion in Michigan will provide jobs to thousands of workers who will spend their paychecks in Michigan, supporting their local and regional economies and their local and state tax bases."
 The starting wage is $15 per hour and Amazon is offering sign-on bonuses for some positions ranging from $250 to $1,000, company officials said. Other benefits include health, vision and dental insurance from the first day, 401(k) with 50 percent company match, up to 20 weeks paid parental leave and the prepayment of 95% of tuition for courses in high-demand fields through Amazon’s innovative Career Choice program.
 Amazon's job expansion comes as it grows its company presence in southeast Michigan. Amazon has fulfillment and sortation centers in Livonia, Shelby Charter Township, Romulus and Brownstown Township. There are also delivery stations in Romulus, Wixom, Hazel Park and one that opened its doors in Sterling Heights last week.
 Last month, Amazon announced that it plans to acquire more than 25,000 square feet of office space in Detroit for 100 new high-tech positions. Among the jobs posted Monday were for warehouse team members in Troy, Romulus, Livonia and Shelby Township and delivery station liaisons in Hazel Park and Romulus.
 "Some of the positions that immediately come to mind are stock, packers, but beyond those type of roles we have many opportunities in training, quality engineering, HR-related so these opportunities can be expansive," Agboka said. "We want people that are committed."

 # Former Michigan Catholic school teacher charged with sexual misconduct
 Ariana Taylor
 The Detroit News
 View Comments
 A man who formerly worked as a teacher at a Catholic school in Jackson has been charged with multiple felonies for sexual misconduct and could spend the rest of his life in prison if convicted, according to the Michigan attorney general's office.
 Joseph – or Josef – Comperchio, 66, was arrested in his Fort Meyers, Florida home Monday on two counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct and four counts of second-degree criminal sexual conduct.
 Comperchio could be facing 15 years to life in prison, the attorney general's office said in a release.
 Two individuals reported abuse by Comperchio when they were ages nine and 11 between 1974 and 1977 while Comperchio was employed as the drama and music teacher at St. John Catholic School in Jackson.
 Comperchio will be arraigned at 9 a.m. Tuesday and is being held without bond.
 “My office has received hundreds of reports from people about clergy abuse and I am committed to ensuring each of those tips is thoroughly vetted and reviewed and that credible offenses are prosecuted,” Attorney General Dana Nessel said in the release.
 “My team will continue to follow every lead and turn over every rock to expose the criminal and immoral behavior sexual predators have concealed in our pursuit for justice.”
 In October of 2018, Nessel started a department wide investigation of clergy abuse. Since then, Nessel has seized 1.5 million paper documents and 3.5 million electronic documents through search warrants that has resulted in criminal charges being filed against 10 individuals connected to the Catholic Church.

SAVANNAH, Ga. (WTOC) - The Chatham County Health Department has a new leader. He’s stepping into the role in the midst of a pandemic, but it’s nothing new for him.Dr. Chris Rustin is just two weeks into his new job with the Chatham County Health Department. Though he’s new to the title of administrator, he has a long history in public health. Just before taking this job, he worked for State Department of Public Health in Atlanta as the leader of the largest division and oversaw the operational response to the COVID-19 pandemic for the state.“I think what I bring to the table is an awareness of what other counties are doing, which I think we learn from each other. So, I can take that knowledge and use that to improve the operations here at the health department,” Dr. Rustin said.While he is still getting settled in, he says he’s watched Chatham County’s response to COVID-19 and been impressed with the dedicated staff and community efforts to slow the spread.“The awareness that this health department and this district has made to the public that wearing a mask protects you and your family has certainly contributed to what we’re seeing now, we’re not out of the woods yet, there’s still a lot of work to do, but I think we’re certainly trending in the right direction,” Dr. Rustin said.Though Dr. Rustin is leaving a high-profile job in Atlanta, he says coming back home to the coast was his dream.“I loved the opportunity that I was given, the work that I was doing at the department, but I was always looking for a reason or an opportunity to return to the coast. But it had to be the right position and for me this was the right position, this is what I consider my dream job and I’m excited to be here,” Dr. Rustin said.Dr. Rustin grew up in the area, graduated from Armstrong and Georgia Southern and says this is home. He will work alongside Dr. Lawton Davis and says he’s quickly working to learn all the health department programs.“Every day is a day to reflect on how we can improve for the future and so that’s my goal here at the health department, to continue that improvement process and ensure that the citizens and visitors public health is protected,” Dr. Rustin said.He has hit the ground running and says there will be a time to slow down, but during the pandemic public health must persist for our community.Copyright 2020 WTOC.

I'm just like, look, they're offering children the option that once they get exposed they can switch to virtual. Okay, if you're giving the option to a child, why don't we teachers also have that option if we were to be exposed? We should have the choice on whether or not we want to do hybrid. To them that one is a non-negotiable, it doesn't matter what my opinion is. It's really like, you either work or you go. That's what you've got to be telling us—that we're expendable. But not children. And don't get me wrong, I'm not saying children are expendable. Nobody should be. We all matter. We should all have the options to still function and make money. You're asking teachers to not only take that risk but to potentially be in the hospital—accruing that much money in debt. It's like, you want me to risk my life, for nothing, like you're not even going to pay me nothing. But a child gets to have that option. To me, it's not entirely fair. I love children. I wouldn't be a teacher if I didn't. But I should not be a pawn in a game, just for them to have money coming in based on the head of a child and not an employee. At the end of the day, it all boils down to funding. The more children they can have to come to the school, the more money they get. So an employee is expendable. You know, that's basically what you're telling me.

Rural South Carolina Election/ Voter Registration Agency Under Fire

The sign Ben Whitmire carried into his local school board meeting displayed a simple message: Bring Kids Back.
   
 These three words encapsulated the views of a dozen parents and teachers who stepped to the podium at the Buncombe County Schools board meeting last week and implored district leaders return students to in-person instruction.
   
 "These kids need the interaction with their teachers, mentors, friends and other classmates," said Whitmire, whose daughter is in 12th grade and whose wife teaches in the district.
   
 Whitmire may have opened the meeting's public comment section, but his views weren't the first time Buncombe board members have heard parents demand classroom lessons following weeks of distance lessons.
   
 "We've been bombarded with phone calls and emails," said Donna Pate, a BCS board member. "Hundreds, hundreds of emails."
   
 In a 5 to 2 vote, BCS voted to resume classroom instruction, under a hybrid Plan B model.
   
 Having now experienced virtual learning for a month, many North Carolina parents argue the risks of keeping children away from schools outweigh the risks of bring them back during the COVID-19 pandemic.
   
 Parents have complained about technology glitches, the challenge of juggling work and childcare, and the mental health damages students can experience during isolated school days.
   
 "They have no socialization," said Amber Puckett, a parent of two students in Buncombe middle schools. "They have no reassurance from their teachers. There's no interaction with other children. Kids were not made to get an education in front of a computer screen."
   
 On Sept. 8, a group of parents in the Charlotte sued Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools to bring students into school buildings.
   
 Across the state, district boards are listening, with several voting in recent weeks to cease their all-distance lesson plans. With numerous school boards still set to convene this month, the handful of recent district decisions suggests more North Carolina students will soon have the option to enter classrooms.
   
 Changing course
   
 On July 14, Gov. Roy Cooper announced every district and charter school would have a choice in how it started the 2020-21 school year. Schools could begin under Plan C and have no classroom instruction, or they could teach under a Plan B and split students' time between classroom and remote lessons.
   
 By the first day of school, Aug. 17, most North Carolina students were at home, as districts opted for Plan C amid spikes in COVID-19 case reports. Thousands of students enrolled in their districts' virtual academies for at least the first semester.
   
 Yet a combination of improving case numbers and a disdain for virtual learning has driven more schools to plan for some physical learning.
   
 "It does appear that several districts are moving forward with changing to Plan B," said Leanne Winner, director of governmental relations at the N.C. School Board Association, which has been tracking the re-entry decisions of all 115 school districts in the state.
   
 In Western North Carolina, Henderson County, Jackson County and Madison County are joining Buncombe in bringing back students on alternating "A" and "B" day models that will see students in classrooms for a few days each week. School boards in Sampson, Stokes, Surry, and Wilkes made similar decisions in the past two weeks.
   
 "You know we can't keep schools closed forever," said Henderson County Public Schools board member Michael Absher, whose board voted unanimously to begin Plan B. "The health department's (COVID-19 case) numbers are much lower now than they were in July. That was one of the key things I looked at."
   
 Since late July, the 7-day rolling average of daily COVID-19 cases has dropped from around 1,800 to 1,200.
   
 Dr. Ibukun Akinboyo is an assistant professor of pediatrics at the Duke University School of Medicine who has consulted with North Carolina school districts about their reentry plans. She said she would more enthusiastically encourage districts to bring back students if case totals were decreasing more uniformly statewide.
   
 "The data has suggested that we're still seeing spread," Akinboyo said. "It's hard to tell if we've been decreasing (cases) long enough that we can be sure we're decreasing community spread. But we're heading in the right direction overall."
   
 As other sectors of society have become to reopen in phases - like restaurants, playgrounds, and gyms -- Dr. Akinboyo suggested parents are asking their school leaders why their children can't also congregate safely in schools. Compared to last spring, she said health experts now have a better handle on how to mitigate COVID-19 spread.
   
 'Wreaking havoc'
   
 This week, Craven County Superintendent Meghan Doyle will make a re-entry recommendation to her district's school board, but she wants board members to be the first ones to hear it. She is willing to share the frustrations parents in her district have shared.
   
 "It's wreaking havoc on the lives of our community," Doyle said.
   
 The superintendent listed a litany of remote learning pitfalls. Many students lack the internet connectivity needed to access virtual assignments. More students who are food insecure aren't getting free meals at school. And Doyle said incidents of domestic violence seem to be up as families remain home.
   
 "The pandemic risks doing some of the same damage to students as the hurricanes," she said of her district along the North Carolina coast. "School is the only normalcy that many of our kids have."
   
 As Doyle hears parents' concerns via email, phone and social media, she acknowledges the situation lacks many good answers. Talking with her local health department, she knows coronavirus outbreaks are tied to congregate living facilities. Ask more students to come into classrooms, and the risk increases.
   
 "Health and safety are our first priorities," Doyle said. "We contemplate the impact of losing education on the long-term health and safety of our students and the current safety and health of our students."
   
 Needing clarity
   
 Not every district that started out under Plan C is shifting back towards having students in classrooms. A few, like Nash County Schools and Johnston County Schools, will first phase in preschool students and students with special needs to return. Still others have extended their all-remote plans at least into October.
   
 However, many districts that are exclusively remote still haven't decided when they'll bring students back this school year.
   
 Cumberland County Schools spokesperson Lindsay Whitley said the district hasn't finalized the date for when the CCS board will vote on reentry. Alamance-Burlington School System spokesperson Jenny Faulkner anticipated her district's board will take up the matter of Plan C and Plan B on their work session on Oct. 13.
   
 Parents in New Hanover County Schools will gain more clarity on re-entry sooner. The district board will meet Tuesday night to discuss transitioning from Plan C to Plan B. While some parents will certainly be eager for a shift to some in-person learning, some New Hanover teachers fear the district is no yet prepared to welcome children back.
   
 Amanda White, who teaches chemistry in New Hanover, said the safety protocols and added teaching requirements of teaching both in-person and remote lessons would keep teachers from focusing on the students in front of them.
   
 "There should be some advantage to having the kids in school, and right now there is zero advantage to having the kids in school," said White, who also serves as president of the New Hanover County Association of Educators. "In fact, it's more stressful to have the students in school for students and for teachers and staff."
   
 She recommends her district's board members vote against transitioning to Plan B at Tuesday's board meeting until the district develops a safe re-entry plan that doesn't stretch teachers too thin.

VANCOUVER - More than 50 people called police trying to claim a misplaced envelope of cash that was turned in last week by a Good Samaritan.


  The RCMP say officers identified the rightful owner of $2,600 after sifting through calls from "cash-hungry contestants" all weekend.


  The owner was able to describe the amount and denominations of the cash in the envelope and provided a reasonable explanation of when, where and how it was lost.

"In 1913, W. Gray and P. Long went in ahead of the camp to blaze a trail for pack horses," writes Kate Bell in her detailed 1984 paper called the Cultural History Themes of Garibaldi Provincial Park, Black Tusk and Diamond Head. "Now that access into the meadows .125above Stony Creek at elevation of more than 3,000 feet.375 was much improved with a pack horse route, the climbers sought ways to cross Garibaldi Lake, although boating did not originally start out as recreational pursuit but rather a fast and convenient means of getting to Sentinel Bay."

Horse lovers can take heart to know their equine friends were not forgotten by those who made up star patterns, and chose which would be on the official constellation list. We have two celestial horses, and both are well in view on late summer and autumn evenings.      They include Pegasus, the Flying Horse, and Equuleus, the Colt or Little Horse. That's only two out of the 88 constellations. You can stretch things by adding Centaurus the Centaur, but in Greek mythology, the centaur is half horse and half man.      Pegasus is very large and prominent in the night sky. Since all constellations appear to pass over the sky as the Earth takes its daily spin, it may seem obvious that Pegasus is indeed a "flying" horse. Of course like the other ancient constellations, they were based on mythological stories and immortalized among the stars for future generations to remember.      The most well-known feature of this constellation is the "Great Square" asterism, a pattern within the constellation formed by four stars marking the corners. This is a stellar landmark.      Interestingly, the Great Square is not entirely in Pegasus. One of the stars is in the neighboring constellation Andromeda. Astronomers have plotted the constellations with defined boundaries marked on star atlases. In any case, Pegasus and Andromeda appear forever linked due to the Great Square.      Most constellation patterns hardly resemble what they are supposed to represent. The brighter stars of Andromeda and Pegasus, however, happen to be placed so that, together, it is not hard to picture more or less a complete horse, with the Great Square as the body. One problem: this extended "horse" pattern, as viewed from the Northern Hemisphere, is upside down in the sky!      Andromeda, the Maiden, is mainly seen as two strands of conspicuous stars. Imagined as part of this "horse," they become the equine's back legs.      Andromeda is on the eastern side of the Great Square (to the left as seen from northern latitudes). To the west (right) of the square are the stars we may imagine as the horse's front legs, neck and head.      As it is seen rising in the east, the Great Square appears standing like a great "baseball diamond" of sorts. There are only two stars easily seen with unaided eyes on a fairly dark night inside the Great Square; these might be thought of as "home plate."      Here are the names of the stars marking the corners of the Great Square. The star within the Andromeda constellation is Alpheratz. Going clockwise, the next corner star is Scheat, then Markab and finally Algenib.      Using Scheat and Markab as pointers, extend a line far down to the southeast to find the bright bluish star Fomalhaut.      The leading star in Pegasus, the one furthest to the west (right) can be imagined as the animal's snout. The star's name is Enif (or Epsilon Pegasi).      Enif is an orange supergiant star, about 690 light-years away. It shines at magnitude +2.4.      Going a bit deeper in the hobby of amateur astronomy, telescope users enjoy exploring Pegasus to track down several dim galaxies. Double stars are colored stars are also worthy prizes in any part of the sky.      A small telescope will also locate a fine globular star cluster, M15, just west of the star Enif. It appears as a small, dim, hazy patch in binoculars. Depending on the size of the telescope and magnification, you may easily resolve this hazy patch into a concentrated ball of faint stars.      Equuleus, the Little Horse, is a small constellation of dim stars, right next to Pegasus - to the west (right) of Enif and below M15.      While talking about starry horses, check out the handle of the Big Dipper, in the northwest on September evenings, The middle star, Mizar, is a fine double star, which you may be able to resolve with just your eyes. A faint star right next to it called Alcor. These have been nicknamed as the "Horse and Rider" (Mizar is the horse).   Then there's the Horsehead Nebula in the constellation Orion. Nebulae are vast interstellar clouds of dust and gas. The Horsehead appears very much like its name, a black silhouette superimposed on a more distant nebula that shines by reflected starlight. The Horsehead is very difficult to detect in a telescope, without taking a long-exposure photograph.      Be sure to see the red planet Mars, which this month (Sept. 2020) is very bright leading up to closest approach in October. Mars is dominating the eastern sky on September evenings, well below the Great Square.      Meanwhile brilliant Jupiter shines in the south in the evening, with Saturn about 10 degrees to the east (left). Look about an hour before sunrise for brilliant Venus in the twilight glow of the eastern sky.      New moon is on Sept. 17.   Keep looking up at the sky!
