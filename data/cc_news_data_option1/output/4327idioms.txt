It's possible, if unlikely, that a small economic-relief package will be approved in a post-election "lame duck" session of Congress. More likely, a broad rescue measure could be enacted early next year, particularly if Joe Biden wins the presidency and his fellow Democrats capture the Senate. Even if President Donald Trump were to win re-election, most analysts foresee at least a modest stimulus next year.

 # Winter lands with a wallop: Marquette sets two snowfall records
 Ariana Taylor
 The Detroit News
 View Comments
 Fans of HBO's show "Game of Thrones" will note that winter is coming to Michigan — and, in fact, has arrived in some areas.
 The Upper Peninsula has already broken snowfall records. On Sunday, Marquette had a snowfall that topped two records, the National Weather Service reported.
 Marquette had 8.3 inches of snow on Sunday, breaking the previous day record of 3.1 inches in 1976. The heavy snowfall also pushed Marquette above the record of total snowfall for the month of October with 19.2 inches. The previous record for October was 18.6 inches of snow in 1979.
 "We just happened to have a pretty good lake effect snow event yesterday and that's what put us over the top. We just had the right set up for unusually cold air for this time of the year and the right wind direction off the lake to get the snow here at this location," said NWS meteorologist Don Rolsson.
 Marquette and surrounding areas can expect from two to five inches of more snow on Monday, Rolsson said. The weather service advises of slippery road conditions.
 Rolsson said most of the record breaking snowfall will be melted by Halloween weekend as temperatures remain moderate in the area.
 Gaylord also received a little under a inch of snow on Sunday as well.

The contrarian would say that Belichick is turning to some other master plan of not worrying too much about this season with Newton and being fine with positioning the Patriots to tap into one of the three franchise passers in the first round of the 2021 draft, Trevor Lawrence, Justin Fields and Trey Lance. Or at this point, Kyle Trask and Mac Jones are starting to have appeal in the 10-20 range, too. It's hard to believe, however, given Belichick's competitive nature, that he is willing to tolerate this kind of effort.
 There definitely was a power struggle of egos between Brady and Belichick. Brady found his ideal outlet but Belichick suddenly doesn't have solutions without Brady masking many of the Patriots' problems with his steady play and on-field leadership.
 While Brady made the Buccaneers buy in and go all in every which way, the Patriots didn't see the need to budge for him. No one expected Belichick's mojo to go out the door with Brady like this, but it has, along with Brady still being much better than what Belichick is left with at quarterback.

"gtmStoryTitle" : "Asian Markets Take A Dive As China Further Devalues Its Currency",


--DocBreak--
A decade ago, Facebook was at the heart of a new breed of "social" games. Titles like Zynga's FarmVille became cultural phenomena, in part because they were free to start playing and were built into Facebook. If you needed to do something in the game, it would alert you on Facebook. You could also invite Facebook friends to play with you.
 As smartphones became more powerful, though, many games migrated to Apple's App Store and Google Play. That's not to say Facebook's gaming is unpopular; the company said 380 million people play games through its service each month.
 Nowadays, mobile games can take up a lot of space on your smartphone. Fortnite can reach nearly 3 gigabytes in size, a hefty ask if someone wants to download the game to play while on the go. 5G wireless technology and smart download tricks by developers are expected to help, but Facebook says its newest gaming feature will help too.
 By effectively making it easier to play mobile games by removing the need to download and install them on a phone, Facebook could take back its mantel as a key destination for gaming.
 Facebook signaled it has bigger hopes for its cloud gaming efforts but wants to focus on mobile games for now in part because its executives believe game streaming technology isn't broadly ready yet for graphically intense console and PC games.
 "Cloud game streaming for the masses still has a way to go," Rubin wrote, "and it's important to embrace both the advantages and the reality of the technology rather than try to oversell where it'll be in the future."

Oh heavens, I thought, did they not know of the Gingham Dog and the Calico Cat who side by side on the table sat? Where did I go wrong? Did I not read this poem to them when they were little? It’s possible. I read it to mine, so I guess I figured I read it to this batch of young’uns too. Apparently not.
 If some of you have not read it, it was written by Eugene Field of St. Louis and was actually entitled “the Duel.” The point of this lovely poetry of my childhood, is the fact that the Gingham Dog and Calico Cat sat upon a table, until one night there occurred a terrible spat. The short poem ends with some believing they were stolen, but the truth about the cat and pup, is this: they ate each other up.
 A lesson in not fighting I suppose, but as my siblings and I fought even after being read this warning numerous times, the message doesn’t always get through.
 The fact is, that poem stirred the memory of “A Tall Book of Fairy Tales” that mom sent down here to me some decades ago when I had little ones. She sent the one we had; it had a few ink marks, and a few pages were taped together, but it was still the same as I remembered.
 Along with that old dog and cat fight, there was one of my favorite poems from this book, “One Day When We Went Walking.” This one was written by a Valine Hobbs in the early 1900’s. Apparently poets actually wrote down their work on paper in those days and got it published, instead of splashing it on a social media page, only to be drowned out by critics, etc., until it is deleted or forgotten. Or maybe people just felt more like writing, in prose, in rhyme, whatever struck their fancy at the time.
 I have used this poem in my mind more times than I care to count; probably several times a day. I don’t want to ruin it for those who haven’t read it, but one verse is “One day when we went walking, I found a brownies shoe, a brownies’ button shoe. “ A dry pea pod,” said Sue. And the end is “next time that I go walking, unless I meet an elf, a funny friendly elf, I’m going by myself.” You can imagine the other verses, similar to the brownie shoe. A mermaid’s fan, a dragon’s tooth, a fairy’s dress, and all the rest. All knocked down with logical explanations by others. But I preferred the magical explanations.

I could imagine a dragon’s tooth, I have imagined dinosaur bones and meteorites in our old woods in back of the house as a kid, so a dragon’s tooth isn’t all that far off my imagination’s trail. Alone I could imagine everything being anything, and there was no one to correct me, or give me a rational explanation. I really wasn’t looking for that. How much more interesting to just let my imagination tell me what things could be, rather than what they actually are.
 Did I really believe some of those things I imagined? I like to think I did. I like to think I still do. Poetry, particularly poetry for children, had no limits. There didn’t have to be a lesson in them, although, in the case of the Dog and the Cat there was definitely a moral to the story, but mostly they were entertaining. Short, usually rhyming to have the sing-song effect children (and me) seem to cling to, the rhyme made them easy to remember, and lovely to read.
 Of course, I have read to this new generation of kiddos, many times, many books, but I apparently goofed and left out the old ones, my favorites growing up; the well-loved condition of The Tall Book was proof that the book and the writings inside were indeed, well-loved. There was nothing “special” about the book. I’ve seen kids books that are full of glitter, that have a squeaky toy inside, books that mimic movies (or is it the other way around), books with secrets that can only be read under a black light, and now, books that have a “scan me” notice, or a webpage attached for more information, pictures, or endings.
 I’d rather not. I’d rather have the simple book. The book with one illustration for the poem or story, then let the words do the rest. Words without additional glitter, because we can imagine glitter if we want, if the words feel that way to us. We can picture what the dog and cat looked like during their spat, if the words lead us there and then let us fill in the illustration. “A brownie’s button shoe” can be conjured up by words alone, but if we each drew it out would they all look the same? Or would they look the way we imagined them looking, simply by reading those four words, and then reaching out to walking in the woods and stumbling upon a brownie’s shoe.
 Back when these were written, words had to work harder to get little minds to work harder, to imagine even greater than the author’s original thought. Words. So much more than scribbles on paper.
 Every Christmas, mom would light a candle by her chair, and during the days leading up to Christmas Day, would read a chapter or two of “ A Christmas Carol.” The book she read from had no pictures. Yet I saw Marley just as clear as day, there beside mom and the candle light. I heard his chains clank up the stairs, and saw the weight of what he dragged with him after death. And there wasn’t picture number one that mom held up for us to see. The pictures were drawn by the written word, and embellished with our thoughts. The way words should work.
 With that thought, I think I’ll comb through the bookshelves and find that “Tall Book of Fairy Tales,” before this generation is completely grown. There are poems and stories I think they should know. And to tell you the truth, I think I’d like to read “Wynken, Blynken and Nod” again, just to see if it still can make me think of sleep and dreams.
 Stay safe. Stay well. Never give up on fairy tales, you truly are never too old.

The injury bug bit hard last week, and more than a few fantasy football owners are likely in search of fill-ins. Generally, you should be always be planning ahead and thinking about your best path to a championship, but if you're 3-4 or worse, you might need to do whatever you can to win the matchups in front of you and worry about the playoffs when (or "if") you get there. That might mean making a deal that primarily only helps you in the short-term. On the flip side, if you're already checking fantasy playoff schedules, you can try to take advantage of desperate owners. Either way, it's all about finding the right buy-low, sell-high targets, and Fantasy Pros' Mike Tagliere is here to help with trade advice in his Week 8 Stock Watch that includes Tom Brady, Ryan Tannehill, Mark Andrews, Ezekiel Elliott, and more.
 This is definitely the time of year when the vultures should be circling around bad teams in your leagues. They might not be completely out of the playoff picture yet, so you shouldn't feel guiltyt about trying to take to fleece them. If someone just needs live bodies for the week or is desperate at a particular position in which you have depth, go ahead and make a move, even if it looks like a short-term loss for you. Targeting guys who have already had their bye weeks in exchange for guys who have yet to take a week off can really pay off down the road as you jockey for playoff position.
