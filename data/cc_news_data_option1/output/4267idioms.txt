Look for Trump to continue promoting his “America First” policies, which have pulled the U.S. out of multilateral agreements that he maintains were not in the country's interests. He's also likely to highlight construction of more than 200 miles (320 kilometers) of his promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and recently brokered deals normalizing relations between Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates and Israel.

Screening for the disease includes colonoscopies, which are used to identify and, when possible, remove polyps and other growths. Fecal tests can be useful in identifying blood in the stool. Each of these can be indicators of cancer or a pre-cancerous condition. A study published last year found the updated age guidelines for colorectal cancer screenings can prevent about 30,000 potential cases each year and save 11,000 lives. Not all insurance companies are on board with the new guidelines, though, and some patients would have to pay for earlier screenings themselves.
 As for why the disease is striking an ever-younger population, researchers still aren't sure. Some suspect changes to behavior, as well as environmental factors, and have launched studies to learn more. Others worry that younger adults are ignoring the physical symptoms that may indicate the presence of colorectal cancer. These include visible blood in the stool, particularly when it's bright red in color; rectal bleeding; persistent sensations of pressure within the bowel and abdomen that are not relieved by a bowel movement; ongoing abdominal pain and cramping; weakness or fatigue and unexplained weight loss. Another indicator is changes to bowel habits that last more than a few days, such as constipation, diarrhea or a change to the shape of the stool.

And a problem it is, there's no question. Although the vast majority of homeless people are not criminals – unless you count loitering – some local residents feel they're being harassed. And it's true that a few do have drug or alcohol problems. But they need help, not condemnation – and that's why King and others should be commended for their efforts. One of those others is Mayor Sue Catron, who has made helping the homeless one of her priorities.
 King's officers will be reaching out to the homeless population to determine their needs. He'd especially like to find them shelter – or get them back to their actual homes – during the holiday season. He and others working on this issue know that while there are shelters, as mentioned earlier, they don't scratch the surface when it comes to sheer numbers. More space is needed.
 King is a pastor himself, so part of his desire to help others stems from his innate Christian charity. Cornerstone Fellowship, another local church is also involved. As King explained it, they are working with CREOKS, Cherokee Nation, and the Veterans Affairs hospital to help connect homeless people with resources – including but not limited to hygiene, mental health services, substance abuse services, employment, education and transportation.
 They can use the community's help in their efforts. This a chance for many area residents who pay lip service to charity to put their money and time where their mouths are. It's an important project, and the timing is critical.

NEW YORK (AP) — A New York court on Thursday upheld a decision dismissing state mortgage fraud charges against Paul Manafort on double jeopardy grounds, affirming a lower court judge's finding that they mirrored the federal charges that landed President Donald Trump’s former campaign chairman behind bars.
 A four-judge panel in the state's intermediate appeals court ruled that Manhattan prosecutors failed to show that the state charges they brought against Manafort last year warranted an exception to state double jeopardy protections.
 Manhattan Judge Maxwell Wiley had reached the same conclusion in December, explaining at the time that "the law of double jeopardy in New York state provides a very narrow window for prosecution."
 Prosecutors contended that the state charges qualified for an exception because they were meant to prevent “very different kinds” of harm than the federal charges that landed Manafort behind bars and that Wiley had taken an “exceedingly broad view” in reaching his decision.
 The appellate judges, in their ruling, found that the statutory differences prosecutors cited in their April appeal paperwork and during oral arguments this month “fall far short” of satisfying the “very different kinds” of harm exception.
 The ruling is yet another blow to what had widely been seen as an attempt by Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr., a Democrat, to hedge against the possibility Trump would pardon Manafort for federal crimes.

 The headline data point is that unemployment rate in September fell statewide to 4.2% from August’s 4.8% but this shrouds the true nature of the state’s economic condition. State officials say the shrinking labor force and the number of people still seeking unemployment benefits as a result of the pandemic paint a truer picture of the slow economic recovery from the depths of the employment crisis when the majority of the economy was shutdown in late March and April due to the pandemic.

 Why is it important for women to get into electoral politics?
 I come from a family of privilege. Despite that, when my husband died, I had to face several accusations as a woman. I often think about the hardships that women who are not as well placed have to face. Politics is a space where we can reach out to people and it is important for women to take the plunge.
 What will be your priorities for the constituency if elected to power?
 My priority is to improve affordable healthcare, in the midst of a pandemic. There is economic slowdown and people have lost jobs or seen steep cuts in salaries, which needs to be addressed. I also want to focus on education and environment, issues close to my heart.
 Is this your one off attempt in politics or are you are here to stay?
 I am here to stay. Winning or losing the elections will not change my motive of wanting to help people.
 How do you perceive your chances of winning against BJP candidate Munirathna Naidu, who has won twice from here?

Tahlequah Police Chief Nate King's new push to help the homeless during the holiday season is both altruistic and pragmatic – and that dual purpose comes from a position that is somewhat uniquely his.
 King has been expressing concern over not just the homeless population in this area, but its seemingly explosive growth over the past few years. He has spoken about it in numerous public forums, both from his own observations and those of his officers and community members who deal with them.
 The chief has seen evidence that other communities are dropping many of their homeless folks off in Tahlequah, at least temporarily. That would come as no surprise, since Cherokee County residents are far more generous than most – and Tahlequah already has an abundance of services for people who find themselves down and out. The Tahlequah Day Center, Tahlequah Men's Shelter, Hope House, Help In Crisis shelter – all offer lifelines of one sort are another to niche groups of people.
 Tom Lewis, a founder of the men's shelter, pointed out in a guest editorial in the Oct. 22 edition that many services like that facility were already in place here. He and others worked tirelessly to care for the less fortunate many years ago. And that was when area homelessness wasn't as acute a problem as it is today.

The Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association Tournament Management Committee, as its name implies, is charged with managing tournaments for high school sports across the state.
 But on Wednesday morning the TMC voted, 15-0, to recommend to the Board of Governors that MIAA-sponsored tournaments be canceled for the winter season, which is scheduled to run from Nov. 30 to Feb. 22.
 That comes on the heels of the entire spring season being canceled in April and regional and state tournaments for the fall season being canceled in August, all due to the coronavirus pandemic.
 "No one supports tournaments more than Tournament Management does," TMC chair Jim O'Leary said. "So I think it's important that we're looking out -- and we expressed in the springtime that the regular season was for, first and foremost, getting the most experience for our student-athletes in the state, and we're continuing along that line with some clarity."
 The decision is, as noted, a recommendation, one the Board of Directors will most certainly not address until after various state agencies, most prominently the Executive Office of Environmental Affairs, release guidelines for winter sports. That's expected to occur in early November.
 Direction from the COVID-19 Task Force will also play a major role in the Board of Governor's decision.
 Each of the MIAA's nine districts were tasked earlier this fall with seeking input from their member schools about what direction to take with regard to the winter season.
 Support was overwhelmingly in favor of canceling MIAA-sponsored postseason tournaments while attempting to replicate a locally controlled format that has worked well thus far this fall, that is shortened schedules with schools placed in geographic pods to reduce travel.
 "I do believe that those of us who are able to compete in the fall are managing it, and I think we're all pretty proud of what's going on right now," said Westboro High athletic director Johanna DiCarlo, one of four Central Mass. representatives on the TMC.
 "I personally also feel that sort of creating the same kind of system for the wintertime that we've had in the fall would be reassuring for our districts, our kids, our parents, everyone. They sort of know what to expect now that they know what we're doing in the fall."
 Monty Tech AD Dave Reid strongly feels the same way.
 "I think most schools in Central Mass. would just like to be able to get 10 to 14 games within their pods, which worked well in the fall," said Reid, noting Monty Tech moved all fall sports to the fall II season. "So I think that's where most of them are, including our league (Colonial Athletic). We don't think getting to a tournament is a realistic thing this year."
 That said, the recommendation does not preclude leagues or districts from holding their own postseason tournaments.
 District 2 is comprised of the CAL, Dual Valley Conference, Inter-High, Southern Worcester County League, and Notre Dame Academy and St. Paul in Worcester. The Mid-Wach League and Worcester County Athletic Conference make up District 3.
 So the option is there to have championships in Central Mass. this winter, whether they be by district, North County and South County, or the entire region.
 "This is not much different than what we do already," DiCarlo said. "I mean, we have some tournaments, especially at the end of basketball season -- the Clark Tournament, some other things -- that are locally run tournaments with whatever schools they chose to invite or qualify."
 DiCarlo also pointed out that leagues, districts or regions will be able to hold their own tournaments at the end of the regular season when the statewide tournament format is adopted beginning with the 2021-22 school year. So it just could happen sooner rather than later.
 "Other than having those tournaments in the future sanctioned by the MIAA -- they're going to have to file that paperwork -- people can do whatever they want to do, at least during the regular season, in terms of having competitions," DiCarlo said.
 While the start and end dates to the winter season have been approved, eliminating MIAA-sponsored postseason tournaments will provide flexibility in terms of allowing districts to start later or finish earlier.
 It will also provide flexibility when it comes to making decisions on rescheduling or canceling contests, taking pressure off administrators and ADs to squeeze in games for so-called playoff pushes.
 Here and There
 After much discussion, the TMC voted, 14-1-1, to continue with the current regional format of North, South and Central/West for swimming and diving. That runs counter to the statewide format that will go into effect for all other sports beginning in September, but the longstanding issue of facility availability was a factor that couldn't be overlooked. … The Track and Cross- Country Committee voted to give leagues the option of moving indoor track to fall II and allow those meets to be held outside if indoor venues aren't available.

Violent attacks against the Indigenous fishery by some non-Indigenous fishers and their supporters have resulted in the destruction of some Mi’kmaq-caught lobster. People who buy lobster or do business with the Indigenous fishers have also been subjected to intimidation and harassment.
 Sack said the recent vandalism and loss of potential sales have cost the band more than $1.5 million.
 It's a situation being watched closely by Membertou First Nation near Sydney, N.S., which is also planning to launch a self-regulated lobster fishery.
 Chief Terry Paul said the community plans on adopting the livelihood fishery plan currently being used by Potlotek First Nation in southern Cape Breton, which was launched earlier this month.
 He said the plan was developed by the Assembly of Nova Scotia Mi'kmaw Chiefs so "we all have a part to play in that plan."
 "There may be some minor changes, that depends on the discussions we have with the fishers and community members," Paul said, adding that safety and conservation will be top of mind.
 Meanwhile, Sipekne'katik First Nation is also developing its own seafood marketing materials.
 Once the band finds a market for its lobster, Sack said the community is considering having a special barcode on the packaging.
 "You would scan it and it would say, 'This lobster was caught by Mi’kmaq lobster fishermen fishing off St. Mary's Bay,'" he said. "We could even have pictures of the boat and the crew."
 But while band councils work on developing community-wide plans for buying and selling lobster, some individual treaty-holders are taking a different approach.
 In a bid to challenge provincial regulations, Maloney said she is now planning on selling Mi'kmaq "treaty lobster" more regularly.
 She said she's considering selling at an undisclosed roadside location near Halifax — a common practice in a province with an abundance of fresh seafood.
 "If there's anybody that is going to be selling it or buying it, it will be considered illegal and it would be the black market," she said. "Maybe if I'm arrested we could challenge this and figure it out once and for all."

NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — The Tennessee Titans have been through so much dealing with the NFL's first COVID-19 outbreak during the season resulting in one game postponed and rescheduled to a second game pushed to a rare Tuesday night kickoff.
 They've come through still undefeated.
 Now they host one of the NFL's two other remaining undefeated teams with the Pittsburgh Steelers (5-0) finally coming to town Sunday to play that first game postponed by the coronavirus pandemic. The Titans (5-0) also heard the talk they should be punished, even Steelers tight end Eric Ebron's call to make them forfeit.
 “This is something that you look forward to, regardless of all the stuff that’s going on with the pandemic and … being worried about forfeiting a game man," Titans linebacker Rashaan Evans. “And these are the type of games you look forward to.”
 The delay simply made this game bigger.
 This is only the fifth time in NFL history that two undefeated teams have played in Week 7 or later, not counting strike seasons. The winner of the first four all made the Super Bowl that season with now-Titans coach Mike Vrabel playing and winning two such games with the Patriots.
 The Titans went 16 days between games, routed Buffalo and then needed overtime to beat Houston 42-36 last weekend for two wins in six days. Pittsburgh thumped Cleveland 38-7.
 Pittsburgh coach Mike Tomlin said his Steelers have talked about dealing with the uncertainty since training camp. His Steelers were forced to take their bye on Oct. 4, erasing their scheduled bye with now three straight road games starting with a showdown for the top of the AFC.

In court on Thursday, Goldman Sachs’ general counsel, Karen Seymour, said that agents and employees of Goldman Sachs Malaysia had violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by “corruptly promising and paying bribes to foreign officials in order to obtain and retain business for Goldman Sachs.”
 The fund, 1Malaysia Development Berhad, was set up in 2009 by Najib to promote economic development. It relied primarily on debt to fund investment and economic development projects and was overseen by senior Malaysian government officials, according to court records.
 Najib set up 1MDB when he took office in 2009, but it accumulated billions in debts, and U.S. investigators allege at least $4.5 billion was stolen from the fund and laundered by his associates.
 Public anger over the corruption allegations contributed to the shocking election defeat of Najib’s long-ruling coalition in May 2018.
 Two Goldman Sachs executives have also been personally charged for fraud. Tim Leissner, who was the chairman of Goldman's Southeast Asia division, pleaded guilty to money laundering and violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Another Goldman executive, Ng Chong Hwa also known as “Roger Ng,” will stand trial for money laundering and violating the FCPA in March 2021.
 The Department of Justice also indicted Low Taek Jho, a Malaysian national with close relations to the then Malaysian ruling party and was the centre player of the 1MDB fund, with similar charges to the Goldman executives. Low lived a lavish lifestyle in New York, buying luxury goods and even a yacht. Jho's whereabouts are unknown, although he's believed to be somewhere in China and out of the reach of international authorities.

Karen Creason   Dec. 22, 1943 - Oct. 20, 2020   Karen Creason passed away in Sequim, Wash., Oct. 20, 2020, at the age of 76 after a seven year battle with Alzheimer's Disease. While very sad at her passing, we are, as her friend Peter put it, glad "she is released from being someone she never was." Alzheimer's is a most cruel and unjust master. She outlived her husband Gerald "Jerry" Creason by almost a year. She is survived by her daughter, Colleen Bittner; grandson, Kyle Bittner; and her siblings, Wayne Harms and Patricia Lewis.   Karen was not just smart but BRILLIANT. She grew up humbly in the Midwest and was told she could aspire to be a secretary one day. But Karen always took the road less traveled. She went to Loma Linda to study Medical Records management. She was one of only four non-Seventh Day Adventists at the school. She made three lifelong friends there. She then took a job at the Oregon Health Sciences Hospital as director of Medical Records. But her sights were higher. She wanted to become an attorney. She went to night law school at Lewis & Clark in Portland while working a full time at OHSU. She graduated summa cum laude. She became an attorney when only a handful of women were litigators. As a sign of the times, she was sent home her first day in court for wearing a pant suit and told to return wearing a dress. At Stoel Rives LLP, she became the managing partner for Health law. There she mentored numerous women over the years and broke down many barriers for all. She was a highly respected attorney in the Pacific Northwest for over 30 years.   She had an amazing intellect, always three steps ahead of the rest of us. Yet she could interact as easily with a judge as any blue-collar worker, drawing from her humble beginnings. She read 800 page James Michener books in two nights and loved discussing the quantum universe with her equally nerdy grandson. Karen loved to entertain. She organized block parties and unforgettable firm parties. Christmas and Thanksgiving were always raucous affairs with "orphaned" friends always welcome and in attendance. She and Jerry loved to travel and experience other cultures. She would research and practically write her own tour book before each trip. Life was always about learning for her.   Karen was ever the philanthropist, supporting the Arts throughout Portland, working with Death with Dignity and PEO, and serving on many non-profit boards such as the Johnson Foundation, and Lil Lifesavers. She was well known for "being there" for any friend in need with a helping hand, whether it was being a Chemo Buddy, making food if you were sick, or helping you with your legal woes. Our family greatly appreciated all the friends that reciprocated this kindness in her later years. Especially her friends in retirement that formed a group called the Wonderful Wacky Women. She treasured all of these relationships.   Her devotion to family was as fierce as her business acumen. She was a terrific mother, daughter, sister, aunt, wife and grandma. She encouraged all of us, down to the grandnieces and nephews, to be our best and pursue whatever made us happy. She was always there with financial and emotional support when needed.   The world will sorely miss Karen Creason.   At her request and per COVID restrictions there will be no memorial.   We request that in lieu of flowers a donation be made to Compassion and Choices (her favorite right to die organization), or to the Alzheimer's Association.

We were able to get a July 4 celebration in, but we were all outside, it was hot, and the majority of the time was spent in the pool. This recent cold snap reminded everyone winter is coming and outdoor gatherings are quickly coming to an end, unless the family wants to gather around the burn pile.
 I will probably be able to get one more mowing in, the garden is done, and then what? Being cooped up in the winter is hard enough, and now you’re telling me I can’t have family functions to look forward to? The last thing I want to do is cause my family to get sick, but at the same time, I’m not sure I can do the right thing and cancel our family traditions.
 They will all go along with whatever we want to do. I mean, we are the oldest, and probably the most vulnerable. The bottom line is, it’s stressing me out, along with everything else going on in this country. I got so tired of listening to political commercials I started watching reruns of "Andy Griffith."

So I just love the image, and right away, I could see myself happily sitting at home, minding my own business, and hear a knock at the door. So I get up, and I open it up, and there’s fear. There’s shame. There’s jealousy. And I either fling open the door and say, “Welcome home. It’s all yours,” totally forgetting who actually lives here, or, as we often do, I try to shut the door and desperately pretend I never heard the knock, and somehow, the force comes in the window or down the chimney. It appears. And so I often think of almost the skill one learns in meditation practice as, what do you do when you open the door? And can you remember who lives there? Can you recognize, “OK, this is what’s visiting”? “It is a visitor”? If I get lost in it or overcome by it, it will cause suffering — doesn’t make me bad; it will cause suffering. How am I gonna relate to it?
