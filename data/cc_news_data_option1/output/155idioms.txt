The patient she was about to meet now was no different. On December 4, 1980, she approached the house of Raymond Patriarca Sr., the brutal head of the Patriarca crime family, which dominated organized crime in New England. She told herself that no matter what crimes he’d committed, he was entitled to medical care. “His tentacles reached into every nook and cranny of the six New England states,” Roberts writes in her memoir _The Doctor Broad_. By the age of 25, Patriarca had been indicted as an accessory to murder. Known as Public Enemy No. 1 in Providence, the crime boss had allegedly ordered his own brother to be killed and had served 10 years for murder and conspiracy.

LAKE CITY — She’s not crying “danger, danger" yet.
 But in the name of transparency, Missaukee County Treasurer Lori Cox warned county commissioners that she may need to draw more money than ever before from the tax revolving fund in March. It won’t affect the general fund and she doesn’t need their permission, but she does like to keep them in the loop, she said.
 Summer 2019 taxes are still coming in, and while the vast majority of the bills have been paid — Cox said township treasurers have turned over to the county 90% of the total due — the rate at which the taxes are being paid is down slightly, about 2.77%. If the trend continues, then when settlement time comes around in March, Cox might have to take $100,000 more than she has before from the tax revolving fund to settle up with the townships. There’s enough money in the accounts to do that, but it’s a bigger withdrawal than commissioners are used to Cox making.

The 25% tariff on steel imports, which the Trump administration levied last year, drove up production capacity of U.S. steel producers. Improved capacity also provided a boost to domestic steel production. However, higher production, partly driven by restarted mills, contributed to the sharp decline in U.S. steel prices last year. In fact, after rallying to multi-year highs in 2018 on the back of Trump-imposed tariffs, U.S. steel prices fell back to the pre-tariff levels in 2019. Sliding steel prices, softening demand across major domestic end-markets and trade tensions weighed on U.S. steel producers last year. Driven by consecutive price hike actions by major U.S. steel mills and supply-side actions, U.S. steel prices have lately gained some traction. However, a significant recovery in prices is not expected over the near term given the oversupply in the market and weak domestic steel demand.

Una estrella brillante, en la constelacion de Indus, visible desde el hemisferio sur, ha revelado nuevos detalles de una antigua colision que la Via Lactea sufrio con otra galaxia mas pequeña, Gaia-Enceladus.
 Un equipo de cientificos con participacion del Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC) ha logrado datar esta colision, la cual se produjo en la historia mas temprana de la Via Lactea.
 Los resultados, publicados en el ultimo numero de la revista 'Nature Astronomy', se han obtenido combinando datos de las misiones Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) de la NASA y Gaia de la Agencia Espacial Europea (ESA).
 A lo largo de su historia, la Via Lactea ha absorbido multiples galaxias mas pequeñas. Aunque estas poblaciones estelares pueden ser identificadas como "estructuras cinematicamente diferenciadas" dentro de la galaxia, en general es complicado datar con precision cuando ocurrieron estas fusiones.
 Los cientificos se han basado en oscilaciones naturales detectadas en la estrella para determinar que esta, denominada Épsilon Indi, nacio hace unos 11.500 millones de años. Posteriormente, la colision con Gaia-Enceladus altero su movimiento a traves de la Via Lactea.
 Asi, la edad de esta estrella implica que la colision se habria producido como pronto entre hace 11.600 y 13.200 millones de años.
 "El trabajo se basa en la caracterizacion de una unica estrella brillante llamada Épsilon Indi para estudiar la historia de la Via Lactea. Las estrellas contienen registros fosilizados de sus historias y, por lo tanto, del medio en que se formaron. El equipo de trabajo ha utilizado datos de satelites y de observatorios terrestres para extraer esta informacion de Épsilon Indi", explica Aldo Serenelli, investigador del CSIC en el Instituto de Ciencias del Espacio.
 Utilizando astrosismologia, tecnica que estudia la estructura interna de las estrellas pulsantes, ha sido posible establecer nuevos limites al momento en que ocurrio el evento con Gaia-Enceladus, segun comenta Serenelli.
 La existencia en la Via Lactea de muchas estrellas procedentes de Gaia- Enceladus indica que la colision tuvo un gran impacto en la evolucion de la Via Lactea.
 "Comprender esto es hoy dia de gran importancia en astronomia, y este estudio representa un paso importante en determinar con exactitud cuando tuvo lugar esta colision", resalta Serenelli.
 Asimismo, el trabajo demuestra el potencial de la astrosismologia basada en datos obtenidos por TESS y las posibilidades que existen cuando pueden combinarse observaciones en una unica estrella brillante con instrumentos de ultima generacion.

“So to have either reduced is problematic, to say the least. Over the last several years the real estate market crash was hard on all of these entities so to add to that by the state legislature removing (according to the report) an additional almost $11 million from the governing units in Wexford County has caused budget issues for all,‘ he said. “This has caused many of those entities to ask for additional millage from their taxpayers to pay for critical services they were able to cover prior to these reductions.‘
 Porterfield said the report does not even touch on the revenue sharing reduction at the county level. It is Porterfield’s opinion that the state legislators must look at fully funding its obligations to all local units of government. He also said the taxpayers of this state cannot receive a bill and tell the people to whom they owe that debt that because of financial issues they are only going to pay a portion of those bills until things get better.
 “We would all be sitting in the dark. Our legislators in Lansing should be held to the same standards as everyone else,‘ he said.
 Wexford County Administrator Janet Koch said strained budgets in the public sector are due to several factors including revenue sharing from the State of Michigan. Other factors are the recession combined with the 1994 adoption of Proposal A and 1978’s enaction of the Headlee Amendment.
 “Every year, Wexford County and its townships, cities, and villages, are finding themselves stretched thinner and thinner,‘ she said. “We continue to do our best to provide quality services to our county’s residents and hope the State of Michigan will consider changes in funding sooner rather than later.‘
