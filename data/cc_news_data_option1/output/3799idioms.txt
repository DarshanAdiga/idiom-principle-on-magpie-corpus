 A 43-year-old woman sustained injuries that weren't considered life- threatening when she was shot late Monday in southeast Topeka, police said.
 The case remained under investigation Tuesday morning. No arrests had been made. The victim's name hadn't been made public.
 Gretchen Spiker, public relations specialist for the Topeka Police Department, said officers were called about 9:30 p.m. to an apartment complex in the 2000 block of S.E. Massachusetts, where they found the woman. Massachusetts runs north and south and is one block east of S.E. Adams Street.
 The woman was taken by American Medical Response ambulance to a Topeka hospital, Spiker said.
 She asked anyone with information about the case to contact police by emailing telltpd@topeka.org. Anonymous tips can be made by calling Crime Stoppers at 785-234-0007 or by going online to www.shawneecountycrimestoppers.com.

Milton Major Martin, Sr.   Died September 14, 2020   Milton Major Martin, Sr., 91, of Gainesville, Georgia, went home to meet his Savior on Monday, September 14, 2020. A lifelong resident of Hall County, Milton, Sr. was the son of sharecroppers and was born on March 7, 1929 to Utah and Ola Martin. He was the third oldest of six children whose first names all began with the letter M, and who was fondly referred to by their mother, Ola, as the original M and Ms. Working and living as a young boy with his family on farms during the Great Depression instilled in Milton, Sr. a tremendous work ethic, determination and generosity that were only rivaled by his sense of humor. His first entrepreneurial ventures consisted of selling produce, vegetables or rabbits at roadside stands as a young boy or cutting yards with his tractor on his way home from school. After graduating from Sardis High School, he enrolled in the summer program at Young Harris College in 1947, but quickly realized he was not destined for academics. During study hall, while he should have been studying French and Algebra, he threw his books up in the air and said, "That's it boys, I'm going home!" So he left and enrolled at Southern Business School in Atlanta, GA where he studied a few classes that made more sense to him. Milton, Sr. joined the Navy in the fall of 1948 and spent most of his time managing the ship's store as a bookkeeper. He was discharged from New Port, RI in January 1950.   Milton, Sr. loved to tell his grandchildren stories and his most favorite one of all was how he met their grandmother, Damaris. After returning home from the Navy he asked his younger brother, Merritt, who the prettiest girl was in the senior class. Merritt responded by naming "Damaris Evans" and thus began a courtship that resulted in a wedding held on December 24, 1950. Damaris was Milton, Sr.'s faithful wife for almost 7 decades and raised their 6 children while he built his business.   Milton, Sr. began working as a bookkeeper for C.V. Nalley, a local car dealer, in October 1950 who would pass along to him a passion for the car business. In 1961, he hired his brother Merritt as his first employee and established Milton Martin Autos where he would develop his basic customer service philosophy over the next 9 years: "Satisfaction Guaranteed." In 1970, he became the 3rd Toyota dealer in the state when he opened Milton Martin Toyota, which is now the oldest Toyota dealership in Georgia. Then, in 1989, he opened Milton Martin Honda. While the businesses evolved, Milton, Sr. never lost sight of his customers and employees - he treated both groups like family. He was always closed on Sundays and many of his employees still work for the companies he built to this day. And he was rewarded for his continued efforts. He received the coveted Toyota's Touch Presidential Award 4 times in his career and was featured in the August 1991 edition of People magazine.   Milton, Sr. became known for his visionary and generous spirit outside of his business reputation. He was always looking for ways to invest and partner with developers to improve the landscape of Gainesville-Hall County. Projects such as Royal Lakes Golf & Country Club, the Medical Arts Complex, and others now exist because he helped support them. Simple philanthropic acts were modeled for him by his parents such as donating food or livestock, lending a hand on a farm, or setting extra places at the table for passing travelers. He in turn paid his success forward by donating funds to various charities, giving vans to homeless organizations, hiring people who needed jobs, slipping money or items into the hands of single mothers, as well as countless other ways we are not supposed to celebrate or even mention. He always preferred to do as many good deeds as he could anonymously and without fanfare.   Milton, Sr. was a charter member and lifelong deacon of Lakewood Baptist Church and is credited with naming the church when it was first organized in 1956. He also led Sunday school classes, served on the finance committee and Board of Trustees. Milton, Sr. also served on numerous boards and avidly supported the Boy Scouts, Eagle Ranch, Choices Pregnancy, Little League, American Legion, United Way and Hall County's homeless organization.   Milton, Sr. retired in the early '90s and enjoyed playing golf at Chattahoochee Golf Course, living in Florida for part of the year, traveling to Hawaii, tending to his garden and spending time with his family. You could always find him on Sundays at Lakewood Baptist Church in the middle pew, swinging his fist to a good song or belting out the lyrics with his off-key voice. Or planting trees at his childrens' homes, barking at his grandkids and pretending it was a dog, eating ice cream or popcorn, and watching football or golf on tv. Milton, Sr. was a very simple man at heart. He never cared about the clothes he wore, the food he ate, or even the car he drove in his later years. God, family, business, philanthropy and serving others - these were the most important things to him and the ones he took the most seriously. Most anything else would be met with his full body chuckle or one of his silly jokes. Milton Sr.'s personal philosophy in life was LOVE GOD, LOVE PEOPLE.   Milton, Sr. leaves behind his devoted wife and caretaker of 69 years, Damaris Martin; son & daughter-in-law, Milton Martin, Jr., & Lynn; son & daughter-in- law, Mike & Lisa Martin; son & daughter-in-law, Alan & Pia Martin; son & daughter-in-law, Ricky & Cindy Martin; daughter-in-law Wendy Martin; daughter & son-in-law, Malinda & Jim Foote; bonus daughter Judy Martin; 24 grandchildren & 27 great-grandchildren; sister, Mildred Martin; sister, Mattie Jane Talley; sister and brother-in-law Montene and Jimmy Lewis; and countless nieces and nephews. Milton, Sr. was preceded in death by his parents, Utah and Ola Martin, brother and sister-in law Marcus & Bobbie Martin, brother & sister-in-law Merritt & Mildred Martin, brothers-in-law Walt Talley and Heyward Martin, and his youngest son, Pastor Robin Martin. Blessedly, Alzheimer's had completely claimed Milton's mind when Robin died so he never had to experience the pain of losing his beloved son.   Visitation is scheduled for 11am - 1pm, followed by a 2pm Celebration of Life service, on Saturday, October 3, 2020 at Lakewood Baptist Church. The family requests all visitors to follow face mask requirements, social distancing and COVID-19 seating capacity guidelines.   In lieu of flowers, please forward all donations to Lakewood Baptist Church to provide for its local, national and global ministries at 2235 Thompson Bridge Rd., NW, Gainesville, GA 30501.   Memorial Park Funeral Home, 2030 Memorial Park Road, Gainesville, GA 30504 is in charge of arrangements.   Send online condolences to www.memorialparkfuneralhomes.com

USD 450 to 'stay the course' on hybrid learning, citing teacher concerns and need to ensure COVID-19 spread stays low - News - The Topeka Capital-Journal - Topeka, KS


--DocBreak--
Students in Shawnee Heights Unified School District will stay in two-day-a- week hybrid learning mode after the Shawnee Heights Board of Education voted Monday evening to "stay the course," citing teacher concerns and a need to ensure any change could be sustainable.
   
 The board voted 4-2 to approve the district administration's recommendation to remain in hybrid mode for the foreseeable future. Board members Rosa Cavazos and Rocky Busenitz voted against the recommendation, saying they preferred a more immediate return to full-time, in-person learning.
   
 Barring a special meeting, the board's next decision point on the district's learning model won't come until Oct. 5, and since superintendent Matt Hirsch said the district would need at least two weeks to prepare to change models, Shawnee Heights students wouldn't return for five-day-a-week in-person learning until Oct. 19 at the earliest.
   
 Several parents "spoke" at the Shawnee Heights Unified School District 501 meeting Monday evening. The board, anticipating a large in-person turnout that never materialized, moved the meeting from the usual meeting space to the high school's auditorium, but only a couple of parents came to speak in person.
   
 Instead, dozens of parents submitted written comments, read by board clerk Sara Hoyer and interim superintendent Matt Hirsch, that mostly pleaded with the board to open schools for full-time, in-person learning. Hoyer and Hirsch spent about an hour reading through the comments at the beginning of the meeting, although some comments weren't read aloud because the district had concerns about student privacy. In any case, board president Lauren Tice Miller assured people watching on the livestream that the comments had been delivered to the board.
   
 Beyond a requirement that comments be kept to fewer than 500 words, the board only asked that comments remain respectful. Virtually all of the comments were, and most even thanked the board members for their work and service to the community, but they largely came to the same conclusion -- online and hybrid learning models aren't working, and the board shouldn't delay in bringing students back.
   
 Some parents pointed to internet troubles in connecting to online classes in the comparatively rural district. Others said their children, particularly younger ones, have been frustrated by a lack of teacher access, and parents said they have been clueless as to how to help their students learn. For as stressed as they were, the parents also said they couldn't imagine how stressed teachers have been.
   
 A handful of parents and teachers said they continue to support hybrid learning, and that they were wary of returning to school, but that they understood the challenges other teachers and students might face.
   
 But Hirsch and other district administrators said they were hesitant to rush back into five-day-a-week in-person learning. Although the most recent Shawnee County Health Department data shows a significant drop in COVID-19 transmission rates locally, Hirsch said the district needs to wait to make sure that drop isn't an anomaly and rather part of a longer trend of decreasing virus transmission.
   
 And while other districts like Seaman USD 345 and Topeka USD 501 have at least announced plans to phase students back in for five-day-a-week learning, Hirsch said the district still needs to plan exactly how to bring students back safely. In any case, the district will look at any successes or challenges those districts see in crafting Shawnee Height's future plan to return.
   
 Continuing concerns for Shawnee Heights include ensuring there are at least 3 feet of social distancing between students in a single classroom, and 6 feet between students from different classes. Additionally, buses cannot handle a full schedule of all students while keeping to the county's restrictions of one student per seat, and even when the district does return to full-time, in- person learning, Hirsch said he will urge parents to drive their children to school whenever possible.
   
 In making their recommendation, district administrators also pointed to a recent survey of the district's elementary teachers that showed most teachers are still either moderately uncomfortable or very uncomfortable with a return to full-time, in-person teaching, especially at the higher grade levels.
   
 "If we want to make a change, one of the things we talked about administratively is that we want to make that change is sustainable," Hirsch said. "We don't want to go to change with the idea that, hey, we're going to give this a try and hopefully it will work, but if it doesn't, in two or three weeks we'll switch back. That's not a great model for our staff for sure, and that's what we're hearing from them."
   
 Although the district will not yet set a timetable for a return to in-person learning, Hirsch said the district's general plan will be to bring students back in phases, with preschool through third grade making that initial move and fourth through sixth grades following. Middle and high school students would still remain in hybrid learning.
   
 The district will this week send out another survey to elementary school families to gauge their opinions on returning to full-time, in-person learning.
   
 In other business, the board approved a timeline to hire a new superintendent to replace Martin Stessman, who retired in March after an April 2019 arrest in connection with driving under the influence. Under the timeline, the Kansas Association of School Boards will meet with groups of school stakeholders over the coming months and develop a list of desired characteristics in a candidate.
   
 The district will formally announce the opening in November, with KASB presenting recommended candidates to the board in an executive session in early January and interviews taking place in late January. The board would formally announce the district's new superintendent in February.

Its approval in Parliament was relatively easier than the two farm bills that remove all restrictions on where farmers can sell their produce and enter into agreements with large buyers such as retailers and exporters to share risks and get good returns. The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill is aimed at removing fears of private investors of excessive regulatory interference in business operations. ‚ÄúThe freedom to produce, hold, move, distribute and supply will lead to harnessing of economies of scale and attract private sector and foreign direct investment into agriculture,‚Äù said Danve Raosaheb Dadarao, minister of state for consumer affairs, food and public distribution, while replying to the debate in the House. He said the amendment was in favour of both farmers and consumers while bringing in price stability.

JOHNSON CITY ‚Äî Opening its doors in November 2019, the Langston Centre hit the ground running with its focus on multicultural arts, education and community leadership.
 Supervisor Adam Dickson says the center now has an after-school program for grades 3-8 set to begin Oct. 5, and staff are currently working with the Tennessee College of Applied Technology and the First Tennessee Development District to begin a science, technology, engineering and math, or STEM, camp in October.
 The center also recently launched its Ralph E. Davis Leadership Academy in honor of former Johnson City/Washington County NAACP President Ralph Davis, who died in July 2019. The program is intended to encourage students to learn how to become effective community leaders and voices for social change.
 ‚ÄúWe have a very healthy relationship with East Tennessee State University and the College of Education because individuals through the college are administering the Ralph E. Davis Academy, and they‚Äôre working with our after- school program,‚Äù Dickson said.
 ‚ÄúWe also have our virtual academy, which is through students at Milligan University ‚Ä¶ So in the education realm, there‚Äôs a lot that we‚Äôre very proud of doing in a very short amount of time.‚Äù
 Now, a new scholarship created through a partnership between ETSU and the Langston Education and Arts Development organization could offer more opportunities to students active with the center, which was created through a partnership between LEAD and the city of Johnson City.
 The new scholarship is named in memory of Michael Young, a member of the Langston High School Class of 1965. He was the last student to graduate from the school, which was Johnson City‚Äôs school for African American students until 1965.
 Young, the former chairman of LEAD who played an influential role in the founding of the Langston Centre, died in April.
 In a Tuesday ETSU announcement, Dickson said the Michael Young Scholarship ‚Äúrecognizes a really good man who loved his high school.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúThis initiative furthers Langston‚Äôs motto to ‚ÄòEnter to Learn, Depart to Serve‚Äô and will open the door for more young people to learn, grow and ultimately become trailblazers and agents of change,‚Äù Dickson said.
 Dickson said the annual scholarship was funded with the help of individual donors, LEAD and ETSU, which pulled together roughly $50,000 for the initiative.
 The program will award five $1,000 scholarships to current-year high school graduates to pursue higher education or a trade career.
 Students must be accepted full-time to a four-year university, two-year college or accredited trade school to be eligible. Students must also have a cumulative grade point average of 2.75 or higher.
 LEAD Board Member Carla Forney said students don‚Äôt need to be directly involved with the Langston Centre to receive the scholarship, but Dickson said the initiative could be helpful to young people involved with the Langston Centre.
 ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll certainly open up opportunities for young men and women who are involved in programs at the Langston Centre,‚Äù Dickson said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll open up opportunities for them to grow and thrive.‚Äù
 Dickson said the center‚Äôs relationship with LEAD has remained close since its founding.
 ‚ÄúWe move down a parallel path, meaning that the Langston Centre wants to respect the history of Langston High School. That coincides with the mission of LEAD,‚Äù he said.

SAN DIEGO (AP) ‚Äî Max Stassi, Griffin Canning and the Los Angeles Angels cooled off the playoff-bound San Diego Padres two days after they clinched their first playoff spot in 14 seasons. Stassi had two impressive home runs among his four hits and Canning struck out 10 in six crafty innings to lead the Angels to a 4-2 victory Tuesday night. The loss, plus St. Louis‚Äô 5-0 win at Kansas City, kept the Padres from clinching the NL‚Äôs No. 4 seed in the playoffs and homefield advantage in the wild-card round next week. On Sunday, the Padres clinched their first playoff spot since 2006 by beating Seattle 7-4 in 11 innings. The Padres have the NL‚Äôs second-best record behind the NL West rival Los Angeles Dodgers. The Padres struck out 13 times and got just four hits. Rookie manager Jayce Tingler said the Padres have been pressing a bit offensively recently, and it definitely showed Tuesday night. ‚ÄúI was hoping tonight we would relax a little bit and kind of settle in to some more at-bats,‚Äù Tingler said. ‚ÄúWe did that certainly early; at end of day, Canning just did a really good job of mixing his pitches. The strikeouts stacked up on us. Some of that was he had a really good pitch arsenal tonight that got us a little bit out of whack.‚Äù The Angels remain mathematically in the race for the second wild card and for second place in the AL West. Both of Stassi‚Äôs homers were off Zach Davies (7-4). In the first inning, he hit a two- out shot an estimated 436 feet out to the bullpens in left-center. In the sixth, he hit a two-run moonshot to what is normally a beer deck in right- center for a 3-1 lead. He has seven this season. It was the first career multi-homer game for the catcher. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve known I‚Äôve had it in the tank. Happy to contribute to a win and focused on...

Since the advent of the APC in 2013 and its triumph in the 2015 general elections, elections have become a tough duel between the two dominant parties, the ruling APC at the centre and the Peoples' Democratic Party (PDP). Though 14 parties are on the ballot in last Saturday's governorship election, according to the list published by INEC prior to the election, it was essentially a duel between the two dominant parties, which are equally dominated by strong personalities, rather than strong institutions.

HORNELL -- It won't be long now.
   
 The City of Hornell Department of Public Works is hoping to have a ribbon cutting ceremony this week as the Seneca Street bridge reopens to traffic, DPW Superintendent Mitch Cornish said at Thursday's Board of Public Works meeting.
   
 Next up, East Main Street.
   
 Crews were pouring the sidewalls for that bridge late last week as the city aims to wrap up both bridge replacement projects this construction season.
   
 "They're going gung-ho on East Main Street right now," Cornish said, adding that the bridge's 25 degree skew makes it look smaller than it actually is. "There's a couple hundred yards of concrete going into that bridge, so it's not for the faint of heart. People are asking what's taking so long, but there's a lot of work that goes into it. On the surface it looks like a much smaller bridge."
   
 The large amount of concrete has stretched out the construction process due to minimum requirements on how long the concrete requires to harden.
   
 "When you peel back the layers of the onion and look down in there, the rebar and concrete work is extensive and it's deep," said Mayor John Buckley. "It creates a lot more work. We've also had hangups with utilities which have delayed that. I understand the perception when you look at one bridge compared to the other, but it's not really apples to apples."
   
 The city is working on right-of-ways for the future Canisteo Street bridge project.
   
 Paving work, CHIPs reduction
   
 DPW took a hit in the budget due to COVID-19, and it just lost some more funding with the state cutting 20% of CHIPs funding across the board.
   
 "That definitely hurt us. In any given year, CHIPs money is not enough to cover our paving needs," Buckley said.
   
 The city was able to wrap up most of its 2020 street paving before the news hit, with Webster, Upper Hill, Sherwood and Alley Avenue addressed last week.
   
 "A lady came out to us yesterday and said 'Thank you, it hasn't been paved since 1972!' So I guess we got our money out of Sherwood Avenue," Cornish said. "It looks really nice over there now."
   
 The city maintains 205 streets and 82 lane miles. Buckley is worried this year's cuts from the state may be extended into the future.
   
 "We have some streets that need a lot of attention to various degrees. Cutting CHIPs, cutting PAVE NY, cutting winter recovery money sets us back even further from where we want to be," Buckley said. "My fear is, what does it look like next year and the year after? Are these cuts just a one-off, or will they be in perpetuity? My sense is, because of the economics, I fear is these cuts aren't going to be restored next year and the next thing will be AIM funding.
   
 "We're in for a rough ride right now."
   
 Miscellaneous
   
 DPW will finish trenches and do some pothole patches next month as the road work season winds down. DPW will not be flushing hydrants this fall. The street sweeping season will end around Halloween.
   
 With leaves starting to drop, DPW encourages residents not to rake leaves into roads. Bag them and DPW will pick them up.

Memorial services for Benjamin "Ben" McDowell, 59 of Sidney are at 2 p.m., Wednesday, September 23, 2020, at the Event Center at the Richland County Fairgrounds with Pastor David Huskamp officiating. Cremation has taken place under the care of the Fulkerson-Stevenson Funeral Home of Sidney. Remembrances, condolences and pictures may be shared with the family at www.fulkersons.com.
 For those of you who don‚Äôt know where Ben McDowell came from, have you ever been to Ekalaka, MT? It is nowhere near there.
 Ben sauntered into this world on May 23, 1961 with a unique sense of humor and a heart of gold. He met many people along his journey, bringing them together to form his family. Ben attended school in Sacramento, CA, where he graduated in 1979. He then went on to receive his Diesel Engines degree from UTI in 1980. The moment he finished, he headed straight to Plentywood, MT to join his friends in the oil field.
 In 1984, Ben met Peggy Fjelstad. They married in 1985 and soon welcomed their boys Brady Jon and Bryan Joseph. Ben loved his boys and everything they were involved in. When Ben got involved, he was all in! In 1986, Ben started McDowell‚Äôs Carpet Cleaning in Plentywood and joined the RestorX family in 1988. Ben was very proud of all the work he had done and all of the places he worked with his CAT team. Ben was a restoration specialist and if he didn‚Äôt have the answer you needed, he always ‚Äúknew a guy.‚Äù
 In 1992, Ben and Peggy moved to Sidney and put their boys in hockey; Ben instantly became the king of the microphone at the games. He loved running the penalty box, enforcing the rule that allowed him to hand out his own penalties to players, and giving his opinion on any penalty given to a Richland Ranger. Ben could often be heard saying, ‚ÄúI talked to him, he says he didn‚Äôt do it. And I believe him.‚Äù When the boys got motorcycles, Ben decided it was time to build a motocross track. He quickly learned everything he could about racing, going so far as to become a mechanic for Team Green Factory Kawasaki, working for Ryan Villopoto.
 Ben enjoyed hunting with his boys and never missed an opening day of pheasant season with them and his dogs. He taught them everything he knew and then some. Though Ben had a rough exterior, he still let his soft side show. From the little things he saved and held onto, to the pictures he took when no one even knew. His family always waited to see what photos made the fridge and more importantly, which ones he enlarged and hung in his hall of fame. Every gift Ben gave had a purpose and a story behind it, often with a little note attached. He loved to watch the reaction of the recipient. Ben would do anything for his family and never hesitated to let them know that he was there for them. The bonds he built with his friends were unwavering. He and Kim Fike Leland were very close, never forgetting to comfort one another every December 13th. Yet, we all know, Ben was always up for a good prank. Even though he didn‚Äôt like to admit it, he even laughed when they were pulled on him. He could often be heard quoting lines to his favorite movies, even if you had no clue what they were. Ben will be remembered for all the things he has done for each and every person he met.
 Ben always had a love for horses. In the beginning, his only plan was to build a wall with a door in it. That way his horse could stick his head through, and he could feed it oats all day. Luckily, Park and Rayna convinced him that was not a feasible plan. Then Brady decided to buy a horse. This was all it took for Ben, he traded in his Harley for wranglers and a vest. He was hooked and began to build lifelong friendships all over the United States. Ben proudly supported many kids in rodeo throughout the years. In 2008, McKenzy Averett entered the picture, and he finally found his favorite rodeo partner/laborer. Though he did everything in his power to get rid of her, she hung out and proved to him that she was in it for the long haul. Ben took McKenzy, and eventually her sister Avery, to every rodeo possible, but only after they picked up their Cheetos first.
 Ben‚Äôs world was complete with the birth of his grandkids. There was nothing he was more proud of. Ben loved spending time with all of them on the land and did not know how to use the word no. He spoiled them every chance he got, making sure they had everything they desired, including delivering their first guns to the hospital the day they were born.
 Ben‚Äôs journey on this earth ended on Thursday, September 10th, 2020 at his home in Sidney, MT. He is survived by his sons Brady (Avis) McDowell and Bryan (McKenzie) McDowell; his grandkids Kennet and Lane McDowell, and Bennett and Bexley McDowell; his sidekick Josie, and his large family of friends.
 ‚ÄúWhile the last goodbye is the hardest one to say, this is where the cowboy rides away.‚Äù

Disgraced former police officer Roger Rogerson's murder conviction is unreasonable as shown by how he acted before and after the killing, an appeal court has heard.
 Rogerson, 79, and fellow former detective Glen McNamara, 60, were jailed for life in 2016 for the cold-blooded execution of drug dealer Jamie Gao in a south Sydney storage locker in May 2014.
 At trial, Rogerson argued his innocence by saying he was unaware of McNamara's murder plans.
 "He (Rogerson) brought his own car to the scene of the crime," Rogerson's barrister John Stratton SC told the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal on Wednesday.
 "It would not make sense for him to do it in his own car if it was planned to either rob or kill the deceased."
 One of the three judges hearing the appeal this week said the theory was interesting.
 "But it's been my experience that not each premeditated crime involves skilfully and intelligently thought-through plans," Justice Robert Allan Hulme said.
 "Sometimes, people of reasonable intelligence do some pretty stupid things."
 Mr Stratton conceded that but pointed out the crown case at the four-month- long trial had been that Mr Gao's death was a planned crime.
 "It's not conceivable that this man Rogerson would not have thought through that very basic flaw that, in my submission, even the most simple armed robber would have thought of," he said.
 Describing its case as "compelling", the Crown said Rogerson's reaction as captured on CCTV wasn't consistent with finding Mr Gao's body and McNamara "in a distressed condition".
 "Instead, (Rogerson) and McNamara appear to be acting according to plan," crown prosecutors Eric Balodis and Karl Prince say in written submissions.
 Another prong of Rogerson's conviction appeal calls for a new trial after the emergence of what has been called new evidence.
 If successful on any ground, Rogerson wants the court to reduce his nine-year jail term for robbing Mr Gao of 2.78 kilograms of methamphetamine.
 The Crown submitted the court should dismiss all appeals.
 McNamara's legal team began outlining its appeal on Wednesday afternoon, alleging the trial judge erred by not allowing their client to detail his prior belief that Rogerson had murdered before and that McNamara therefore acted under duress.
 The pair were found guilty in June 2016 after a four-month trial that heard Mr Gao was lured to a darkened storage shed in Padstow and shot dead, before Rogerson and McNamara attempted to cover their tracks by dumping his body at sea.
 They used the skills and knowledge honed over their years as sworn NSW police officers to gain Mr Gao's trust, the sentencing judge found.
