The project for this car has been undertaken by GS Customs in Pune. This particular vinyl showcases shades of colours ranging from Silver, Blue, Magenta, Gold and even Orange. Surprisingly, the wrap-job was done in under Rs 20,000, which is very much bang for the buck. However, like other wrap-jobs this one comes with its set of woes too. For instance, in a hot and humid country like India, these colours are bound to peel off soon. And a patchy wrap around the car looks nothing less than shabby. Also, one is required to visit the customs shop every couple of months to maintain the wrap.

This is a sweet reminder about the need to be kind and understanding with a bit of a gender and cultural diversity thrown in the mix.

The usage of artificial substances to polish the cricket ball, which effectively means ball tampering, could be considered for legalisation when the game resumes after the COVID-19 pandemic that has made bowlers wary of applying saliva on the red cherry.
 'ESPNCricinfo' reported that administrators are "open to the option of allowing for the use of an agreed artificial substance to polish the ball under the supervision of the umpires", which amounts to ball-tampering as per the current rules governing the sport.
 The matter of saliva being unsafe was raised by the ICC's medical committee and it would be addressed before cricket resumes. All sports activities have come to a halt after the coronavirus outbreak.
 Shining the ball is an integral part of Test cricket as it helps the bowlers swing the ball, both conventional and reverse.
 If the move gets the go ahead, it would be quite ironic for the game's administrators after the 2018 ball-tampering controversy which led to one-year bans on Steve Smith and David Warner for conspiring to use sandpaper to alter the ball.
 Following the chief executives meeting of the ICC on Thursday, its medical committee, headed by Peter Harcourt, had issued an update.
 "Our next step is to create a roadmap for the resumption of international cricket which will include a criteria for decision making and a checklist for what needs to happen.
 "This will consider everything from player preparation to government restrictions and advisories and bio-bubbles. The scale and complexity of getting cricket started again cannot be underestimated particularly with respect to a global event," Harcourt said.
 Australian pacer Josh Hazlewood recently said that Test cricket will become harder if the bowlers did not have enough means to move the ball.
 "I think the white ball would be fine, (but) Test cricket would be very hard. Bowlers rely on any sort of sideways movement in the air," said Hazlewood.
 "If you didn't maintain the ball at all for 80 overs it would be quite easy to bat after that initial shine has gone. Whether you use saliva or sweat, maybe one person can do it.
 Former India pacer Venkatesh Prasad supports the idea of not using saliva on the ball.
 "When the action resumes, they should use only sweat for some time as safety of the players is paramount," former pacer Prasad, who played 33 Tests and 161 ODIs for India, told PTI.
 However, he reckons it will be tough for the bowlers to stop all of a sudden.
 "When you are in the thick of things, you tend to forget it. You have to get the upper hand over the batsmen as you can't use anything else besides sweat and saliva.
 "The question is what do you do when the batsman is pulping you? You need to swing the ball and what helps swing the ball is the aerodynamics," the 50-year-old explained.

A blistering 143 scored against Australia in 1998 was voted Sachin Tendulkar's greatest one-day innings in an International Cricket Council poll released for his 47th birthday.
 The 131-ball knock, with nine fours and five sixes, became known as the 'Desert Storm' after a sand storm in Sharjah interrupted India's chase. Tendulkar took on the likes of Shane Warne, Damien Fleming and Michael Kasprowicz but his side lost.
 Tendulkar's blitz narrowly edged out his match-winning 98 against arch-rivals Pakistan in the 2003 World Cup group match.
 "It was neck and neck" until the end, the ICC said in releasing the results of its poll.
 Tendulkar, who played 200 Test matches and is now India's biggest cricket legend in retirement, used his birthday to urge fans to stay indoors during the nationwide coronavirus lockdown.
 "They encouraged me and they prayed for me. What did they pray for? That Sachin shouldn't get out and I should be at the crease," he told Indian broadcaster Star Sports.
 "My wish for them is that they should also not get out. They should also stay inside the crease which means that they should stay at home, safe and healthy."
 Meanwhile the Board of Control for Cricket in India relived the master blaster's unbeaten century against England in the Chennai Test in 2008 in excerpts released on its Twitter feed.
 Tendulkar smashed 103 in the second innings to guide India to a six-wicket win.
 BCCI president Sourav Ganguly, a former India teammate, and other past and present cricketers paid tribute to Tendulkar.
 Current India skipper Virat Kohli said: "Happy birthday to the man whose passion for the game of cricket has inspired many."
 The right-handed Tendulkar made his debut for India aged just 16 in 1989 and broke almost every batting record before retiring in 2013.
 The former India captain is the only cricketer to have scored 100 international centuries and is the highest run scorer with 34,357 runs across formats.

Sachin Tendulkar and Saqlain Mushtaq were involved in umpteen intense battles in the '90s but one such duel left the star Pakistan off-spinner deeply embarrassed.
 In one of his early battles with Tendulkar during the Sahara Cup in Canada, Saqlain thought it would be a good idea to sledge the champion batsman. As it panned out, the wily off-spinner sledged to never sledge the then Indian captain again.
 "I was new when I sledged him for the first time. If I recall correctly, it was the 1997 edition. Sachin quietly came up to me and said 'I never misbehaved with you, why are you misbehaving with me'? I got so embarrassed that I did not know what to say to him," Saqlain told PTI over phone on Tendulkar's 47th birthday.
 "He said to me 'I rate you high as a person and player'. I was so embarrassed that I never sledged him again. I can't tell you what I said to him but I apologised to him after the game.
 "Thereafter, even when he was smashing me all over, I never thought of sledging him," recalled the 43-year-old, describing Tendulkar as one of the most humble human beings he met.
 After the Sahara Cup, which ran from 1996-98, both were in the middle of arguably their most memorable battle during the Chennai Test of 1999, when Pakistan eked out a 12-run win despite an "unbelievable" 136 from Tendulkar.
 Saqlain got the better of Tendulkar in both the innings and his match haul of 10 wickets made all the difference.
 Tempers were running high in that high stakes game but even then Saqlain said he never tried to engage Tendulkar verbally.
 "In that 1999 Test, no words were exchanged. We both were determined and focused to win the game for our countries. We put our heart and soul in it (on day four).
 "I consider myself lucky that my name was attached to Sachin's cricketing career with that match. The only difference that day was that god was on my side.
 "Otherwise, the way he was playing, it was unbelievable. The ball was reversing but he played Wasim Akram with such confidence," said the inventor of 'Doosra'.
 Saqlain was expected to play a lot more than the 49 Tests and 169 ODIs he eventually did.
 Asked how he would rate his rivalry with Tendulkar, the Saqlain said: "I would say it was 50-50. I dismissed him multiple times but he also took me to the cleaners. Even on that day four in Chennai, he scored a hundred in a difficult situation. It was like a dangal going on between us."
 Many failed to read Saqlain's 'Doosra' but he feels Tendulkar was probably the best when it came to reading from hands.
 "The eye is god gifted. Every batsman sees things differently, some pick faster than others. Sachin's eye was razor sharp.
 "Many times, even before I took my stride, he knew what I was going to ball, whether it was a Doosra, top spin or conventional off-spin, his foot positioning was just flawless. Rahul (Dravid) too was very good, Azhar paaji also."
 Wishing the very best to Tendulkar on his birthday, Saqlain fondly recalled the times spent with the maestro off the field.
 "We have had so many fond memories off the field. Had gone out many times, spent a lot of time in Mushy's house (Mushtaq Ahmed) in the UK. He is such a decent and humble human being, that is what stands out in his personality.
 "He was not among the ones who would pull someone's leg. Just by spending time with him, you could learn so much," added Saqlain.

“I think it’s going to help us as a state get a better handle on how much coronavirus is really in our state,” Adler said. “What is the true incidents of this infection in our state?”
 Broadening the metrics for what is considered a COVID-19 case might also create an appearance of a spike in cases, Adler said when asked about it during the briefing. However, the presumptive cases will be listed separately from the confirmed cases.
 “My understanding they will be reported separately,” he said of the daily publishing of statewide COVID-19 data. “… You’ll see both the confirmed COVID-19 cases and then the clinically diagnosed cases listed separately.”
 Whether confirmed or clinically diagnosed, the peak of coronavirus expected in early May, Adler urged Tippecanoe County residents to continue to be vigilant against this virus, which as of Wednesday, had killed 661 Hoosiers.
 “With this (expected surge), it is very important for all of us to stay the course,” Adler said, urging people to continue social distancing, staying at home except for essential errands and practicing frequent hand washing or sanitizing.
 “These are measures that are going to help prevent our surge from being a large or massive surge.
 “I know these measures are not easy. They are challenging for everybody, but these are the best weapons we have right now for protecting everybody in our community.”

Now, this is the point where someone will bring up Target, Walmart or the grocery store and talk about their lack of social distancing as a counterpoint. They apparently haven’t been in one of those places lately, because you see signs clearly posted regarding social distancing. And in some stores, “Xs” are marked on the floor near the checkout registers, so folks know where six feet is, and some stores have gone so far as to put up plastic shields between the customer and cashiers. Some even have a person at the front door keeping count of how many people enter the store and halt entry when it reaches a certain number. There was none of that at Saturday’s rally.
 And to make life even more interesting was a quote from one of the organizers to my colleague Lindsey Erdody at the _Indianapolis Business Journal_. Andy Lyons told the IBJ that if any protesters got sick from the event, it was their decision to attend, so they could handle the consequences.
 He even went so far as to say, “If I get sick and die, that was my choice, and that’s the way it should be. Anybody else here that gets sick because they wanted to exercise their First Amendment rights, they live with the consequences.”
 To a degree, he’s right. If you want to take personal, and to be frank, unnecessary risks with your own health and safety, I will not deny you the right to remove yourself from the human gene pool. The problem kicks in when your behavior has the potential to take the rest of us with you. I have to wonder if Lyons will self-quarantine for two weeks to make sure he did not contract COVID-19 and inadvertently expose his friends, families, co-workers or anyone else where he lives? They obviously didn’t attend, so should they have to live with the consequences of his actions.
 And if none of this has you shaking your head in disbelief, here’s the kicker. The governor wasn’t even there for the protests. From what I was able to gather, Holcomb was at the Statehouse, along with members of his administration. You want to know what one of the things they were working on? Here you go; how to reopen the state of Indiana in a responsible way that gets Hoosiers back to work, the economy back up and running, but doesn’t increase the risk of a COVID-19 spread.
 I’ll let you draw your own conclusions about the protesters, but I’m sure there was a better way for these folks to have their voices heard without putting a lot of other people at risk. But that’s what happens when you spend more time thinking about protesting rather than actually thinking.

CLEVELAND, Ohio (WOIO) - Sales of new homes in the United States plunged 15.4% in March, according to the Associated Press.That's when many states started issuing stay-at-home orders as the coronavirus spread nationwide.So is now a good or bad time to buy or sell a house?19 News spoke with Hoby Hanna, president of Howard Hanna Real Estate Services.He said the impact of the pandemic varies state by state.“I think that close numbers across the country will probably be off by maybe 20% forecasted just because of some fall throughs from mortgage lending and layoffs,” Hanna said,Here in Northeast Ohio, Hanna predicts written business will be off 35 to 40% for the month of April.Now to the big question--is it a good time to buy?He said yes.“And I think what we’re going to see is as the market opens up and people come back. We’re going to see more inventory hit the market. And we’re also going to see potentially interest rates go back up a little bit,” Hanna said.He said low interest rates are good for buyers, and more sellers might be motivated to sell quickly because they already moved.What if you're thinking of putting up the "for sale" sign?“So I think if you're selling your house, now's a great time to get your house on the market. There's not as much inventory you're competing with, you want to put that inventory on. Even if it's internet showings, virtual showings and creates activity, because you'll have, I think you'll have some additional competition coming through,” Hanna said.Hanna thinks virtual showings are a trend that will last, even when the crisis ends.“I think while a buyer might look at 10, 12 homes online with an agent, screen sharing, using Zoom. Looking at a 360 view of the house from the comfort of their own home. And then narrow that search down and then look at the agent and say let's see these two or three that I'm really interested in and fine tune their process,” Hanna said.He said local home showings are down about half of what they normally are, but things are already looking up.“So we're seeing people coming back, activity on the showing side, which means a pretty good demand that we think will continue through May,” Hanna said.Hanna thinks things are tough right now, but as states start opening up and jobs come back, real estate will pick up.“I do think as we get to the third and fourth quarter, end of the third quarter beginning of the fourth quarter, we'll start to see a nice recovery in housing. And I'm a believer that housing will be a way out of this recession,” Hanna said.Real estate is considered essential under Ohio's stay-at-home order, and realtors have been taking extra safety precautions when interacting with customers.Hanna said they just ordered 10,000 face masks and more shoe ‘fitties’ for people going into homes.And he said the coronavirus pandemic has really affected home showings.“I think as homes open up you won't touch as much, you won't open many cupboards and closets, We'll ask sellers to open doors and turn all the lights on prior to coming to a house, but I think they'll be many precautions and social distancing. I think we'll have an obligation to not have as many people in the house, maybe opening the door for people and allowing them to go in, and then coming back out and asking the specific questions and discuss,” Hanna said.Right now Howard Hanna is offering forgivable, interest-free loans for realtors who need some help, since their employees are considered self- employed with no monthly salary.They get a set amount depending on their sales history, which will be taken against future commissions.Copyright 2020 WOIO.

BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (WBRC) - A Birmingham couple faced and conquered the coronavirus as newlyweds.Laquita and Jason Coleman had only been married about 5 months when they were diagnosed in early April.Jason first had mild symptoms. Days later, LaQuita tested positive with more serious symptoms.“Like, you’re getting filled up with fluid or water. Feels like you’re drowning in your lungs and chest,” said LaQuita.She also experienced of extreme fatigue and headaches.The couple was even more on edge because LaQuita is considered high risk because of an underlying health condition."We prayed for each other. That's one thing that kept us," said LaQuita Coleman, "And our hope that we were going to get through it."They have both recovered, but they also warn people to take the virus seriously especially with plans on the table to reopen the state.“The virus is real. I didn’t think it was going to come my way and it did,” said LaQuita, “Make sure you wear your protective gear. Your masks. Your gloves.”Even though LaQuita has recovered and tests show she doesn’t have the coronavirus, she says she still feels like she’s operating at about 85 percent and expects to have to do follow up tests on her lungs soon.Copyright 2020 WBRC.

PORT GIBSON, Miss. (WJTV)-- Flooding has left a Port Gibson family leaving with no place to go. ​​Water rose on MLK Thursday morning leaving neighbors moving cars and personal belongings to higher ​ground. ​​​​​Michelle Banks' home flooded. It's a close call for the others. ​​​"My kids and I, we woke up to water rushing into the house," said Banks. "We had to just gather up ourselves. We left. We couldn't ​gather up any personal items. We just left with what we had, the clothes on our backs and that's it. ​​She says the water was well above her ankles. ​She can't get back to her home, and for now she is living in her SUV with her three children, ranging in age from ​10-20 because they have nowhere to go. ​​"It sounds embarrassing, but it's not a time to be embarrassed," said Banks.​​The moment I reached out to the mayor of Port Gibson he was out in the neighborhood. ​​"For years it has always flooded in this area down by the bottom of this road," said Mayor Willie A. White. "We have a young lady who normally gets flooded on a regular basis when it rains over​ a period of time. It's located just outside the city limits, but we've been moving around all day with first responders and we're going to get in​ contact with our emergency management person who is going to reach out to her and the supervisor whose been doing a great job identifying needs in the county." ​​Banks says she is asking for help to get back on her feet. You can reach out to her by calling (601) 702-9103.
