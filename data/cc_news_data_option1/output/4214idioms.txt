“If the Canadian side really cares about the stability and the prosperity in Hong Kong, and really cares about the good health and safety of those 300,000 Canadian passport-holders in Hong Kong, and the large number of Canadian companies operating in Hong Kong SAR, you should support those efforts to fight violent crimes,” Cong said in a video news conference from the Chinese Embassy in Ottawa.
 Asked if his remarks amounted to a threat, Cong replied, “That is your interpretation.”
 Canada's deputy prime minister, Chrystia Freeland said in Parliament on Monday that the ambassador's comments “are not in any way in keeping with the spirit of appropriate diplomatic countries between two countries.”
 Freeland said Canada will speak out for human rights in China and said Canada will support its citizens living in Hong Kong. "Let me also reassure the 300,000 Canadians in Hong Kong that a Canadian is a Canadian and we will stand with them.” Freeland said.
 Her statements came hours after Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian told reporters that his government had complained to Canada over press criticism of Cong's remarks. He said Canadian leaders “did not verify, but also condoned the anti-China comments spreading across the nation and made groundless accusations against China.”

The working class in England has always been despised by the elites of the left and the right. The Fabianists and Bloomsbury socialists applauded Stalin's 'heroic' efforts to make socialism work and turned a blind eye to the millions who were enslaved and murdered in his name. Up until 1940, they had to embrace the Nazis too due to the Ribbentrop/Molotov treaty and even admired their 'social advances' in eugenics. At least you knew where you stood with Tories - or you did - and even Attlee's old Labour - before 'educated' Marxists took over - who at least declared love for their country and were prepared to die for it. All that ended in 1945 of course.

Not a fan of any of the current seven 2021 Ford Bronco trims? There's probably at least one more in the pipeline, judging by this latest spy video from _The Fast Lane Car_. It shows two Bronco test mules cruising on the road, both equipped with some exceedingly wide fenders, with engorged tires to match.
 These two Broncos share much of their design with the wide-body four-door Bronco mule we spotted testing in Michigan in early September. That means a wider body and track than any other Bronco. Back then, we thought this trim might be called the Bronco Raptor, but more recent rumors suggest Ford could call it the Warthog instead--though nothing's been confirmed.

In March and April, we decided to switch to appointment-only for the store and initially feared that decision causing a slowdown in business. We geared up for a slow year, and instead what happened was the exact opposite. I’m assuming that lack of ability to travel and people being at home noticing the appliance that needed repair or replacement resulted in the uptick in business. We reopened fully at the end of April. As a small-business owner, it definitely caused some sleepless nights at first because of fear of lack of business and then due to potential lack of inventory because of the increased volume in business. In retrospect, it all makes sense that we’d be busy, but in the moment we had no idea how business would go.

PITTSBURG -- When Dr. Sang-Heui Lee arrived at Africa University near Mutare, Zimbabwe for a sabbatical leave from Pittsburg State University in the fall of 2018, he found a surprisingly impressive library building that had been built with funding from American organizations.
   
 "It's very unusual, that kind of nice building as a library at a university in Africa," Lee said. "But, you know, when I was looking for some materials for my class that I taught, I couldn't find any good materials. The most recent I could find was from 1984."
   
 That gave Lee, who teaches in PSU's Kelce College of Business, the idea to start a book drive to collect more up-to-date books for Africa University's library. When he returned from Zimbabwe he shared that idea with Dr. Paul Grimes, the dean of the college, who liked the plan and gave Lee some tips on who he might contact to get book donations.
   
 "You never know how many lives the books will touch when they get used over there in their institution," Grimes said, "and we just think this is a great opportunity for cooperation."
   
 Dr. Lee sent out flyers, announced the book drive at the PSU Faculty Senate, and ended up collecting 18 boxes of books from various departments at the university as well as the Leonard H. Axe Library. On Monday he was preparing to ship the boxes -- which weighed a total of about 400 pounds, Lee knew from calculating shipping costs, though he didn't have an exact count of the number of books -- to Africa.
   
 "I really appreciate my colleagues in the university who really, you know, helped me by sending books," Lee said. "So this is kind of a collaborative work across the university."
   
 The cost of shipping the books to Zimbabwe is being covered by the two journals published by the Kelce College of Business, and the books are expected to arrive at Africa University by the end of the month.

Much as he and his staff have tried to shield themselves and their players from the spread of COVID-19, Kansas State head coach Chris Klieman is finding what he suspected all along, that the virus is nothing if not persistent.
   
 When asked during Monday morning's Big 12 coaches teleconference whether he had any advice for Big Ten coaches just starting their seasons this week, Klieman revealed that the Wildcats still are dealing with new cases of the virus on a weekly basis.
   
 "We still have a number of guys that either are positive, in close contact or are still working their way back from positive," said Klieman, whose No. 20-ranked Wildcats are coming off a bye week before playing host to Kansas at 11 a.m. Saturday at Bill Snyder Family Stadium. "I couldn't tell you an exact number, but we still have several."
   
 Still, K-State is 3-1 overall and has won three straight games to tie for the Big 12 lead at 3-0.
   
 It may be difficult to quantify whether teams are more susceptible to the virus during bye weeks, when they presumably have more time off, but no doubt it adds to the challenge.
   
 "I don't know. We have a few from (Sunday), and who knows when those kids truly got infected or when they were around people," Klieman said. "I think Wednesday when we have our PCR test will be another indication."
   
 Klieman said the players stayed in Manhattan over the weekend as a precautionary measure, practicing Saturday, with Friday and Sunday off.
   
 "It's not slowing down, I know that," Klieman said of the coronavirus. "And whether they stay here, whether they're on campus, off campus, we still feel this is the safest environment.
   
 "But by the same respect, nothing shocks me, whether it's a coach that could get it, an administrator, a player. Nothing shocks me because nobody really understands this virus, other than the fact that it's so rampant."
   
 Youngblood's departure
   
 Klieman did not offer any details Monday on what might have led to wide receiver and All-America kick returner Josh Youngblood's decision last week to enter the NCAA transfer portal.
   
 "He decided to leave the program, and wish him well," Klieman said.
   
 Youngblood, a 5-foot-10, 181-pound sophomore from Tampa, Fla., averaged 35.9 yards on 14 kickoff returns last year as a true freshman, including three touchdowns, and was named to the all-Big 12 first team as well as several All- America teams. He also caught nine passes for 73 yards and rushed 11 times for 55 yards and a touchdown.
   
 But Youngblood only appeared briefly in two games this season, running the ball once for 3 yards with no receptions. He averaged 18 yards on three kickoff returns.
   
 "People leave programs at different times for different reasons, and I'm not going to get into somebody's personal issues or concerns," Klieman said of Youngblood's departure. "I support Josh. Josh knows how I feel about him, and I wish him well."
   
 Youth movement
   
 K-State spent much of the off week on player development, primarily in order to add depth during a season where COVID-19 can ravage a position group in a hurry.
   
 "You don't know when your number is going to be called, but more than likely it's going to be called this year to come in and contribute," Klieman said. "So we've really focused on the guys, either young that haven't played a whole lot, or the guys that have missed anywhere from two to four weeks due to different circumstances.
   
 "So we kind of focused on those guys that haven't practiced and played in all the games."
   
 That certainly is the case at quarterback, where true freshman Will Howard will make his second start against KU after stepping in for the injured Skylar Thompson against Texas Tech on Oct. 3, then going the whole way last week in a 21-14 victory at TCU.
   
 "It's a chance to sit back, probably, and watch his body of work and what he's done," Klieman said of Howard, who completed 8 of 19 passes for 117 yards and also rushed for 86 yards and a touchdown at TCU. "A chance to go against the defense and see more pictures. He just needs repetition.
   
 "We also gave (backups) Nick Ast and Jaren Lewis as many reps, just because I think it's important that those kids are continuing to progress as well. So we're just continuing to develop depth at the quarterback spot, and continuing to try and improve those three guys that have a chance to make an impact for us this year."

Mrs. L. Boyce Caudle, 88, formerly Frances Perlene Hartsell, of Salisbury passed away peacefully in her home on Friday, October 16, 2020.   Mrs. Caudle grew up in Stanly County and graduated from Albemarle High School, where she was a standout basketball player, earning All-Tournament, All South Piedmont Conference and All State recognition for two consecutive years. Her record still stands.   She attended Pfeiffer College where she played basketball and was elected co- captain of the team.   She later attended and graduated from Appalachian State University with a BS in business.   Mrs. Caudle taught personal development at Stanly Community College as an adjunct professor for 18 years.   During that time she also became an Executive Director of BeautiControl Cosmetics in Dallas, Texas. Mrs. Caudle previously served as the Executive Assistant for Fred L. Wilson, Vice President of Cannon Mills in Kannapolis, and later as the Executive Assistant for Merrill Hamilton, President of Rowan Community College, and then as the Executive Assistant for Richard Brownell, President of Rowan Community College.   She later worked for the NC Extension Agency in Rowan County for Harold Caudill.   She served as church organist for Kendall's Baptist Church in New London, Kerr Street Baptist Church in Concord, and Dunn's Mountain Baptist Church in Salisbury for a total of 30 years. Later, Mrs. Caudle, a member of First Baptist Church in Salisbury, served as teacher for the King's Daughters Women's Sunday School Class for 14 years.   Mr. and Mrs. Caudle coached young girls in the Upward Basketball program at First Baptist Church for several years.   Mrs. Caudle was preceded in death by her husband, L. Boyce Caudle, in 2017. They were married for 66 years. Also preceding her in death were her father, A. Dock Hartsell, and her mother, Edna Barbee Hartsell.   She is survived by her son and daughter-in-law, Terry and Julia Caudle of Richfield, and her grandson and wife, Kris and Danielle Caudle of Asheville. Mrs. Caudle is also survived by her daughter and son-in-law, Lynne and David Joyce of Brevard, granddaughter and husband, Anna and Nicolas Bracco, and great-grandsons Lucas and William of Davidson.   Mrs. Caudle is also survived by her sister, Lynette Hartsell and spouse Laurie Fuchs of Cedar Grove, and her brother James G. Hartsell and his wife Barbara of Albemarle.   Mrs. Caudle was an avid North Carolina Tarheel basketball fan and New York Yankees fan.   Mr. and Mrs. Caudle counted their 2009 trip to Detroit to watch their beloved UNC Tarheels win the NCAA Final Four National Basketball Championship as one of their greatest adventures.   The family would like to extend their sincere gratitude to Mrs. Caudle's caregivers, Amanda, Amber, April, Candice, Catrina, Jennifer, Nancy and Markey for their years of love, support and care.   A graveside memorial celebration will be held at Kendall's Baptist Church in New London on Wednesday, October 21, at 2 p.m. The family requests that attendees wear protective masks and practice social distancing for the health and safety of everyone.   In lieu of flowers, memorials may be sent to the L. Boyce and Frances H. Caudle Scholarship at Pfeiffer University in Misenheimer, N.C.   Online condolences may be made at www.powlesfuneralhome.com

Stocks gave up some of their recent gains Monday as Wall Street's hopes that Washington will come through with badly needed aid for the economy before Election Day faded.
 The S&P 500 dropped 1.6 percent, its worst day in more than three weeks.
 The benchmark index had been up 0.5 percent in the early going following a report that China's economy grew at a 5 percent annual rate in the last quarter. The market's slide was broad, though technology, health care and communication stocks bore the brunt of the selling. Treasury yields were mixed.
 The early gains evaporated by midafternoon ahead of another round of talks between Democratic and Republican leadership over a long-sought economic stimulus bill. Wall Street is expecting that lawmakers will agree on new stimulus measures for the economy, but the odds of that happening before the Nov. 3 election have dimmed. Over the weekend, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said a deal would have to come within 48 hours — or by Tuesday — for a stimulus package to be enacted by Election Day.
 Uncertainty over when more aid for the economy may arrive, signs new coronavirus infections are surging and the upcoming election will likely make for a volatile few weeks, analysts say.
 "We're in a period here in the the next couple of weeks where the market goes sideways through the election," Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.
 Stocks have been mostly pushing higher this month after giving back some of their big gains this year in a sudden September swoon. The benchmark S&P 500 has notched a gain in each of the past three weeks. Even so, trading often has been choppy from one day to the next, reflecting uncertainty over the timing of more stimulus for the economy, something investors have been hoping for since July, when a supplemental $600-a-week unemployment benefit package ran out.
 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is expected to bring a his version of a stimulus bill to the floor of the Senate for a vote on Wednesday. However that bill is likely to get zero traction with the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives. So far, McConnell, Pelosi and President Donald Trump have not been on the same page.
 Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin spoke Monday and are due to resume talks Tuesday, Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill tweeted after the end of regular trading.
 Investors were also looking ahead to another busy week of corporate earnings reports. Procter & Gamble, Netflix and American Express are a few of the companies that will reveal the extent of the virus pandemic's impact during the most recent quarter.
 Across the S&P 500, analysts are expecting companies to report another drop in profits for the summer from year-ago levels. But they're forecasting the decline to moderate from the nearly 32 percent plunge from the spring as the economy has shown signs of improvement.
 AMC Entertainment was among the few gainers Monday. Its shares jumped 16.4 percent after the movie theater chain said it plans to resume operations in theaters in New York State later this week.
 Several airlines also rose after the Transport Security Administration said the number of passengers screened in a single day for flights in the U.S. topped one million on Sunday for the first time since the coronavirus cases began to spike in March.

Its business model is controversial – it lends money to people with poor credit scores, charging them interest rates of up to 49.9 per cent, as long as they have a friend or family member willing to pick up the bill if they fail to meet repayments.
 The company has been bombarded by problems this year, including an FCA investigation into whether it had properly assessed whether customers could afford its loans.
 Just last week, new chief executive Gary Jennison wrote a letter to shareholders, assuring them that he would get the business 'back on track' and build relationships with the regulator.
 But investors were dismayed by the company's latest run-in with watchdogs, sending shares down 10.6 per cent, or 1.11p, to 9.33p by the close.
 The FTSE 100 started the week in the red after it was held back by a strong pound, which rose to almost $1.30 on hopes that a Brexit deal could still be agreed.
 When the pound grows stronger it weighs on the dollar-denominated earnings of overseas multinational companies that are listed on the Footsie.
 London's premier index dropped 0.59 per cent, or 34.93 points, to 5884.65, while the more domestically focused FTSE 250 inched 0.24 per cent higher, up 43.17 points, to 17866.08.
 Japan-inspired retailer Superdry also reported a director deal, after co- founder and executive director Julian Dunkerton scooped up 91,817 shares for almost £140,000.
 He spent about 150p apiece on the new stock. But it did little to boost shares, with Superdry closing down 1.6 per cent, or 2.4p, to 149p.
 Mike Ashley's conglomerate Frasers Group – which owns the likes of House of Fraser, Sports Direct and Evans Cycles – had a better day following weekend reports the entrepreneur has made another attempt to buy the ailing department store chain Debenhams.
 Ashley submitted an improved offer this month, according to weekend media reports.
 Frasers shares rose 0.7 per cent, or 2.6p, to 357.4p by the close.
 Elsewhere in retail news, software minnow Checkit clinched a three-year contract to provide services to the John Lewis Partnership, which will allow the Waitrose-owner to automate lots of paper processes and documents.
 The move means Checkit – which surged 5.7 per cent, or 2.5p, to 46.5p – can cash in on a digital push under new boss Sharon White.
 Holiday giant Tui got a cheer from investors, rising 6 per cent, or 16.5p, to 291.8p, after it appointed four employee representatives to the company's supervisory board.

Rove and a connected dark money group are raising money for a GOP candidate for the Ohio Supreme Court, with a focus on yielding power over redistricting efforts in the battleground state. A letter obtained by The Associated Press shows Rove pleading for wealthy donors and law firms in Ohio to donate to Justice Judi French's reelection campaign as the court's conservative majority is up for grabs on Nov. 3, 2020. less

For collectors of Santa themed snow globes, this pretty piece is a definite must-have. Santa in his sleigh flies over the top of a wintery village, while a tiny train moves around the outskirts. This musical snow globe plays Jingle Bell Rock while the train rotates. The globe's base features a lovely little scene of a horse-drawn sleigh driving down a wintery country road. At 6.5 inches high, it's still small enough for little hands to shake and enjoy - carefully, of course, but the details make it equally appealing for grown-ups.
 Another cute Santa snow globe features the jolly old elf in his sleigh outside a quaint cottage. The base features an adorable gift-filled holiday train which rotates as the music box plays Here Comes Santa Claus.
