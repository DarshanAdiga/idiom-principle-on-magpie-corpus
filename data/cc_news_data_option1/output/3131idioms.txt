The structure of "Muppets Now," he said, was also suggested by going back to the early days and taking a cue from the original "Muppet Show," which was in part a send-up of comedy-variety programs of the 1960s and 70s.

He sank a fallaway jumper for a 123-all tie and then beat the shot clock with a go-ahead 3-pointer. Murray had 12 rebounds and eight assists, just missing a triple- double in his first game since March 11. He missed the Nuggets’ first four games of the restart due to a tight hamstring.

Symbols are powerful. Take the bald eagle. When most Americans see an eagle prominently displayed on the back of a quarter or on the presidential seal, they see it as a symbol of pride and strength. The eagle, declared the national bird in 1782, has long been part of the iconography of the United States.
   
 Never mind that Ben Franklin allegedly preferred the turkey over the bald eagle as a national symbol. When the eagle flies, on currency or in the emblem of the United States Marine Corps, we wrap ourselves in the imagery of majestic freedom, and we seek to embody the spirit of the eagle in our national mythology.
   
 Yet, the United States didn't invent the eagle as a powerful symbol. Long before the American Revolution, long before the first Europeans landed on this continent, the eagle was already a revered symbol of courage, wisdom and strength. Native Americans considered the bald eagle a sacred animal and eagle feathers were said to hold a connection to the Great Spirit.
   
 In the Bible, eagles are symbols of spiritual strength. The prophet Isaiah writes that "those who wait for the Lord shall renew their strength, they shall mount up with wings like eagles." If you've ever been to a funeral at a Roman Catholic church, you've surely heard a soloist sing "On Eagle's Wings."
   
 All of which is to say that no one has a monopoly on symbolism. The same symbol may mean different things to different people in different circumstances. Symbols change and evolve, just as situations change and evolve.
   
 In the 1920s, the Nazi party created a new symbol known as the Nazi Eagle. Depicting an eagle with open wings above a swastika, the Nazi Eagle has since been appropriated by neo-Nazi groups and continues as a popular symbol among white supremacists. Like the swastika, it is used as a cudgel to intimidate and strike fear into the hearts of non-Aryans and those opposed to an ideology of hate and bigotry.
   
 This has been a tough week here in Hingham, Massachusetts, on Boston's South Shore. Symbols have been twisted and misconstrued and misrepresented, leading to much division and hurt. The so-called "Thin Blue Line" flag stirred controversy when town officials sought to remove it from firetrucks and firefighters refused to take it down. Back the Blue rallies were hastily scheduled, resulting in counter protests and calls for unity.
   
 Emotions have run hot, engendered with much passion, and complicated by the two-year anniversary of the death of a police officer shot in the line of duty in neighboring Weymouth. And while justice must always override feelings, it's hard when neighbor opposes neighbor in the midst of an ongoing global pandemic.
   
 Proponents of the flag view it as a symbol of solidarity with the police; opponents see it as a racist symbol used to counter the Black Lives Matter movement. And there is very little middle ground, indicative of the divided and highly polarized and politicized times in which we live.
   
 Unfortunately, the Thin Blue Line flag has been co-opted by white supremacists in the same way that the Confederate flag has been co-opted. That's not an editorial statement, but a fact. This doesn't mean that everyone who flies it is a white supremacist, or that those who care deeply for and support the hard work of police officers shouldn't be passionate about standing up for them. I know the vast majority of people participating in Back the Blue rallies have good intentions in their hearts.
   
 But it does mean that some white supremacists fly this flag. And when we listen to people of color say that this flag is a cause of deep pain, fear and oppression, it's time to take the symbol down. Anything we can do to remove barriers to healthy, honest and open conversation is worth doing. Especially when so much is at stake.
   
 Symbols are powerful. We all must use them wisely and be aware of their ever- evolving meanings.

Bloomberg) -- Colleges are scrambling to figure out how many fans can experience the thrills and pageantry of NCAA football in person this season.
 Texas A&M University Athletic Director Ross Bjork said he expects the school to allow about half of its 110,000-seat stadium, Kyle Field, to be filled for games. Florida State University announced that Doak Campbell Stadium in Tallahassee would be limited to 20,000 fans this fall, just 25% of its capacity.
 Virginia Tech sent a letter to fans saying it doesn’t expect to welcome capacity crowds to Blacksburg’s Lane Stadium, but wouldn’t specify an exact percentage because “if we pick a number today, it could likely change over the next few weeks.”
 Then, in a bombshell announcement on Thursday, Penn State said it would play its games at Beaver Stadium without fans for the time being.
 Despite public health officials’ desires to limit public gatherings, college football’s rabid fan bases are still hungry for any chance to experience the action, which is due to start at the end of August.
 On Twitter and Reddit, fans are scouring the internet for answers to questions that have flummoxed athletic departments for months: is having any fans at games in the midst of a pandemic in hot spots like Florida and Texas wise? And if so, who will get the few seats that are being made available?
 It’s a no-win situation for schools. If they pick students, it may cost them millions of dollars in revenue from season ticket holders that pay full price. Side with big-ticket donors and students could claim that they’re being denied an experience that’s considered a rite of passage at many schools.
 Penn State’s hand was forced by an order from the state’s health department, which said the school is subject to a 250-person limit on outdoor gatherings -- even at its 106,572-capacity stadium.
 “The Pennsylvania Department of Health has provided guidance to colleges and universities that they must follow the 250 or less outdoor gathering limit,” said a spokesperson for the department. “For a football game, this would mean that the attendees of a game would be the players, coaching staff, officials and athletic staff. Fans would not be allowed at this time.”
 Penn State isn’t conceding that fans won’t be able to attend, as long as they can pay for a luxury suite. Sandy Barbour, the school’s vice president for intercollegiate athletics, said only that there won’t be fans in “general seating areas,” according to a statement.
 The school can’t be blamed for trying to find any path that will allow it to recoup what Barbour’s statement said would amount to revenue losses in the “high eight figures” and allow it to get big-ticket donors on campus this year, sports economists and researchers said.
 “Universities are smart, and there is probably a reason why they wrote ‘general seating areas’ there,” said Jon Solomon, editorial director at the Aspen Institute’s Sports and Society Program. “A big part of this is the relationship between major donors and athletic departments. They’re the lifeblood of an athletic department, and their donations are critical for infrastructure and other projects.”
 A Penn State spokeswoman said the school is “continuing to work with the governor’s office to understand all aspects of the guidance. This includes press box and suites access.”
 All the fretting over the decision may be for naught if the season falls apart, should there be Covid-19 outbreaks on college campuses.
 “Assuming people will still want to go to the suite, it seems like a good way to maximize revenue assuming they will play anyway,” said Andy Schwarz, an antitrust economist who is a co-founder of the Professional Collegiate League, a new paid college sports league launching in 2021. “As it is, as I understand the Big Ten protocols, it’s hard to imagine the season making it to its second month unless suddenly college kids act more like hermits, and that seems unlikely.”

Other than Facebook’s non-neutrality, which takes the form of Facebook manipulating which content you see first, if at all, the company seems content to turn a blind eye to bogus advertisers that use the platform to reach huge numbers of people with phony, and even malware-laden ads. I have personally seen products advertised that I know with absolute certainty cannot be for sale, because they do not exist – at least not yet. Scammers find a cool gizmo in a Kickstarter campaign, and swipe all its pictures and videos, and re- package them to look like an item being advertised for sale. They rope-in thousands of people, each of whom pays out money, many of whom provide credit card information. Then they innocently wait for their order to arrive. By the time these buyers get frustrated and start to look into where their package is, the scammer has long-since closed up shop and moved on to the next scam. Reporting it to Facebook does not help. It’s gotten bad enough, I don’t even bother to open Facebook ads anymore.

LAXMIPUR, Aug 5: Anyone not familiar with the area will surely hesitate to decide whether it is a highway or a cropland.   The Bhola-Barishal highway at a number of points would give rise to such confusion, with its dilapidated state causing huge sufferings to thousands of commuters and hiking risk of road accidents.   Carpeting got heavily damaged and countless potholes developed on the road that is regularly used by people of 16 south-western districts, including Bhola, Barishal, Satkhira, Barguna, Jashore, Pirojpur, Khulna, Bagerhat.   Specially, 10.5 km portion from Laxmipur to Maju Chowdhury Hat of the highway is now in horrible condition.   Although the Road Transport and Highways Division has done minor repair works on the highway at different times, it didn't sustain due to the excessive pressure of heavy vehicles.   Thousands of sand and stone laden lorries now use the highway to carry construction materials to the Noakhali-Cumilla highway that is being upgraded into a four-lane one.   The Maju Chowdhury Hat is nothing less than an industrial zone as a total of ten sand and stone fields were set up there. Besides, there are ghats for docking launches, cargo vessels and ferries.   Consignments of rods, cement and other construction materials reach here through water-route and later enter the adjacent districts using the Bhola- Barishal highway.   Aside from lack of repair work, excessive pressure of heavy vehicles is also greatly responsible for the poor state of the highway.   When it is the dry season, commuters struggle to breathe as thick fog filled with dust overlays the highway and adjacent areas.   During the rainy season, the commuters can breathe in fresh air but struggle to commute due to the muddy condition of the road.   Now, road accidents have been a common scenario of the highway thanks to the dilapidated condition of carpeting and frequent potholes.   While visiting the highway recently, the passenger buses, lorries were seen to move slowly on the highway.   But light vehicles like four-wheelers, CNG-run auto-rickshaws were frequently being stuck in muddy pits created on the road.   Sometimes, it took several hours to get the wheels out of the pits.   Locals said the road has long been in dilapidated condition despite being an important route of the country.   Hundreds of goods laden vehicles and passenger buses in addition to light vehicles regularly ply on the highway.   Using the highway becomes riskier after the sunset as there is no streetlamp.   Taslim Uddin, a truck driver, said the road has been in such a sorry state for the last three years.   "There are thousands of water-filled potholes that turned the road into a death-trap. Vehicles frequently get stuck in these pits and go out of order and create long queues of vehicles on both ends," he added.   According to Laxmipur Road Transport and Highways Department, the tender process to upgrade the 10.5 km portion into a four-lane one was completed last year.   But the contractor is yet to get the work order as the comparative statement (CS) has not been passed in the ministry.   Md Mojammel Haque, sub-divisional engineer of Laxmipur RTHD, said the road can't be repaired as all formalities of a tender to widen the highway were completed on December 19 last year.   Although the upgradation work was not done due to some difficulties, no other tender was floated to repair the road, he added.    -UNB

Bloomberg) -- What exactly does the Mall of America, with enough space for nine Yankee Stadiums, look like without throngs of Midwestern shoppers? Or Bourbon Street in New Orleans free of revelers? Or breadlines in the teeth of an economic meltdown?
 These are the kinds of questions the 2020 pandemic raises about hubs of tourism and consumer spending, particularly those built on models that need big crowds.
 So Bloomberg News teamed up with Orbital Insight, a California-based company that uses satellites, drones, balloons and mobile-phone geolocation data to track what’s happening on the ground. (Orbital has received funding in the past from Bloomberg Beta, a venture-capital unit of Bloomberg LP.)
 By counting phone signals in 15 designated areas each day for the past three months, the data offer a way to see how many people are returning to where they eat, play and spend money — at mega malls, upscale retail streets and nightlife hotspots. Golf courses are humming again, but so are the nation’s non-profit food banks, underscoring the gap between the haves and the have- nots.
 The picture that emerges is not of a V-shaped recovery, but of an economy that’s being reshaped, taking its time to heal and threatening to leave permanent scars.
 Like a Hurricane
 Months of home confinement have left many Americans itching for a night out at the bars, or maybe a getaway to one of those cities where whatever happens there stays there.
 Such is the allure of Las Vegas, Nashville and New Orleans. But pedestrian traffic in the main nightlife districts in the three cities ranges from just 15% to 44% of year-earlier levels, according to Orbital’s phone tracking data. Along Bourbon Street in New Orleans, restrictions have induced a relative calm along the touristy strip of the French Quarter notorious for crowds with to-go cups of red slushy drinks.
 “It feels like there’s a hurricane that’s supposed to land today or tomorrow,” said Brittany Mulla McGovern, executive director of the French Quarter Business Association. “We just don’t have anybody and people are just prepping to not be here for a while.”
 Local businesses are trying to adapt, with more social-media promotions and online shopping options, she said. But the current dearth of tourists might be the eye of a harsher storm. A pressing question is whether conventions will descend on New Orleans like usual this autumn. That’s when many shops and restaurants will have to decide whether to continue or to close, given the looming expiration of government aid and rent-abatement periods. The Big Easy, meanwhile, waits for the pungent air of the party to return to its most famous street. “Normally at 8 a.m. people are drinking Bloody Marys,” McGovern said, noting that some locals see the upside of Bourbon without the constant commotion. “It’s the cleanest it’s ever been.”
 The Drive to Tee Off
 The pandemic hit U.S. golf courses in the northern half of the country at the least bad time — the winter off-season. So when lockdowns started to end as spring arrived, the links were among the first tests to see if people would return to public places.
 According to the data monitored at three prestigious courses, two of them — private clubs at Cypress Point in Pebble Beach, California, and Pine Valley in southern New Jersey — look to have returned to year-ago levels, according to Orbital’s data.
 Back to normal isn’t yet the reality for Mike O’Reilly, golf operations manager at Kohler Co.’s Whistling Straits, just outside Sheboygan, Wisconsin. This was supposed to be the year he welcomed one of the sport’s biggest international spectacles. Instead of helping oversee operations for the 2020 Ryder Cup, which was postponed until September 2021, he’s focused more on bringing in local clientele because of the air-travel downturn.
 O’Reilly said Whistling Straits is running about 75% of normal for this time of year, buoyed by marketing aimed at players within a day’s drive rather than jet-setting corporate types and the bucket-list crowd. That’s possible because it’s part of a resort that’s open to the public.
 Golf is a natural fit for social distancing so O’Reilly is optimistic. Plenty of duffers are taking up the sport, buying equipment and heading to public courses. “Play may be down a little bit at some facilities but play is really up overall at a lot of facilities,” he said.
 Frenzies at Food Banks
 At the other end of America’s economic strata are those who find themselves without enough money to eat. In March, nearly 200 U.S. food banks suddenly became lifelines to the thousands who never needed such assistance.
 According to Lee Lauren Truesdale, chief development officer at The Foodbank Inc. near Dayton, Ohio, February was fairly normal with almost 2,350 people served. In March, that number doubled and the National Guard arrived late in the month to help with distribution. In April, nearly 8,700 people received its emergency food assistance with the help of two off-site distributions in a university parking lot nearby.
 An even bigger influx occurred at the Weld Food Bank in Greeley, Colorado, where strong demand appeared to be sustained through July, according to the mobile-phone data.
 At the Food Bank of Siouxland in Iowa, Orbital’s data didn’t capture the jump in demand, but only because it doesn’t have a distribution pantry at its address where phone activity was measured and staff started working from home, according to Valerie Petersen, the depot's development director. Siouxland gave away more than 300,000 pounds of food per month from March through June, breaking earlier records, and 46% more in July than a year earlier.
 “We do foresee the increased need continuing into the fall and are planning to feel the effect of the pandemic through at least the end of 2020,” Petersen said by email.
 Mauled at the Malls
 As many as 25,000 stores are expected to close in the U.S. in this year, mostly in shopping malls, according to Coresight Research. Bankruptcies are piling up, leaving landlords and their retail tenants to worry about the future.
 At South Coast Plaza in Southern California, the Mall of America near Minneapolis and King of Prussia mall northwest of Philadelphia, activity is returning slowly but still looks down 44% to 76% from a year ago, Orbital’s phone data show. That matches up with what mall tenants are seeing.
 “In the larger indoor shopping malls, we are seeing traffic gradually increase,” said Craig Migawa, the owner of Pepper Palace Inc., a chain of hot- sauce and spice stores with more than 80 locations, including one in the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, and in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania.
 He said shopping centers are doing a good job of offering hand-sanitizing stations, masks and social-distancing signage. His stores are now providing “sampling gloves” for taste-testing customers and requiring a new spoon for each sample. A new “Sauce Finder” will help customers browse on iPads throughout the sales floor.
 Migawa said he suspects traffic will return to pre-pandemic levels for retailers that offer an experience so it’s more of a “fun thing to do and less of a gathering of essentials that can be done online.”
 ‘Kind of Creepy’
 In upscale urban shopping districts from Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills to Chicago’s Michigan Avenue, the summer flocks of tourists aren’t materializing like usual and activity looks to be 25% to 36% of last year’s level.
 Along Boston’s Newbury Street, a corridor of cafes, spas, museums and boutiques, mobile-phone activity looks to be about 32% of levels a year ago. Stores that are able to reopen are making adjustments like those at Winston Flowers, a 75-year-old family business.
 Co-owner David Winston said the city’s Back Bay area has been eerily quiet since mid-March. The pandemic struck florists during one of their busiest stretches of the year — Easter, Mother’s Day, Secretary’s Day and graduations. Winston reopened the Newbury shop on Thursday, hoping for a return of residents nearby who fled the city and workers trickling back to the office.
 Winston said he’s reorienting the Newbury location to focus more on household plants, pots and accessories and less on labor-intensive floral arrangements. Going forward, the New England flower shop will scale back from seven to four locations including the one on Newbury, where only Brooks Brothers has been in business longer, he said.
 “I know the pulse of the street pretty well and it’s been kind of creepy the past four months,” Winston said. “It’s really different. There’s a lot of vacancies, the traffic is lighter, I feel bad for the restaurants — I don’t know how they do it. It’s a really interesting and kind of a sad time.”

Bloomberg) -- Warren Buffett’s dire airline predictions have hit close to home.
 After dumping his stakes in airlines earlier this year with a warning that the pandemic had unleashed fundamental change on that business, Buffett’s own Berkshire Hathaway Inc. took a roughly $10 billion impairment charge tied to Precision Castparts, its massive maker of plane parts. A vaccine may be the only remedy for the pandemic’s “particularly severe” impact on the aerospace market, Berkshire said.
 “The Covid-19 pandemic produced material declines in commercial air travel during the second quarter,” Berkshire said Saturday in a regulatory filing discussing second-quarter results. “Airlines responded by reducing and/or cancelling aircraft orders, which is resulting in significant reductions in build rates by aircraft manufacturers and significant inventory reduction initiatives being implemented by PCC’s customers.”
 At Berkshire’s annual meeting in May, Buffett announced a full reversal on his airline bet, with his conglomerate going from one of the biggest shareholders in all four major U.S. carriers to owning none. A rally in airline shares over the next month had critics including President Donald Trump saying Buffett had erred, but the S&P 500 Airlines index is down 26% since that early June high.
 Despite those stock sales, the Omaha, Nebraska-based company still had a significant exposure to the air travel slump through Precision, a business it bought more than four years ago in a deal valued at $37.2 billion.
 Now, Precision has had to restructure, including by cutting 10,000 employees in the first half of this year. The business reported a pretax loss of $78 million in the second quarter, compared to a profit of $481 million in the same period a year earlier.
 Berkshire expressed caution about when this pain might end.
 “In our judgment, the timing and extent of the recovery in the commercial airline and aerospace industries may be dependent on the development and wide- scale distribution of medicines or vaccines that effectively treat the virus,” Berkshire said in the filing.

Carlton coach David Teague says he and his players are still confused about the new holding-the-ball interpretation after a series of baffling decisions during Sunday's 22-point loss to West Coast in Perth.
 The Blues led by 19 points early in the third quarter, but West Coast went on a scoring blitz to secure the 11.6 (72) to 7.8 (50) win in front of 19,092 fans.
 The most controversial moment of the match came in the second quarter when Carlton defender Sam Petrevski-Seton got pinged for holding the ball.
 Petrevski-Seton was powerless to get a disposal away after having his arms pinned in a bear-hug tackle from Jack Darling as soon as he got the ball.
 The 22-year-old expressed his disbelief when the free kick was paid, with the subsequent 50m penalty gifting the Eagles a lucky goal.
 There were a number of other decisions - or non decisions - during the game that also left fans scratching their head.
 "Our players are seeking a fair bit of clarity around it at the moment," Teague said.
 "It's a hard one. Any time you change an interpretation through the season, it's quite hard - as much for the umpires - to adjudicate.
 "Whether the umpires felt that was right or wrong that call, I don't know because they're going to make mistakes as well.
 "So it's hard for us as coaches and players to understand which one was an error and which one wasn't to get a pattern going forward."
 Teague says he will continue to implore his players to win the ball, despite the risk of being pinged for holding the ball.
 West Coast set up the win with a four-goal blitz inside the final four minutes of the third quarter.
 Eagles midfielder Dom Sheed was best afield with 26 disposals, nine clearances and two goals, while Nic Naitanui (41 hitouts, seven clearances) was a dominant force in the ruck.
 The Blues lost Jack Martin to a calf injury in the second quarter, while ruckman Marc Pittonet spent about 30 minutes off the field with a finger injury.
 Fisher finished with 4.0 from 12 disposals in a career-best display, while star midfielder Patrick Cripps tallied 19 disposals and eight clearances despite spending long stints up forward.
 West Coast's sixth straight win improved their season record to 7-3, while Carlton (4-6) now face an uphill battle to make the top eight.
 The Eagles have come from behind against Collingwood, Geelong and now Carlton in recent weeks, and coach Adam Simpson said his team is still searching for consistent four-quarter displays.
 "It shows good resilience that we can come back," Simpson said.
 "We'll take this game and cherish it, it's a win. We've won a few games on the trot
 "We walk away really happy ... but we need to get better."
