Jack Tigertail
 Jack Tigertail was the first Native American to be buried at Miami City Cemetery. Born in the Big Cypress in 1872, Tigertail was situated within a Seminole culture that was rapidly changing and adapting to life after the atrocities committed against the indigenous population during the three Seminole Wars, which took place from 1816 to 1858. Whereas the Seminole had spent the latter half of the 19th century living off of land and trading with white settlers at the base of the Miami River, the 20th-century Seminole was marked by engagement in the regions burgeoning tourism industry.
 Like many other Seminole families at the turn of the century, Jack Tigertail moved his family from Big Cypress to a Native American camp located inside a tourist attraction called Coppinger's Tropical Gardens. Like the countless others like it at the time, this tourist trap showcased Seminole lifestyles as a roadside attraction to winter visitors from the North. Needless to say, these businesses were not owned by the Seminole and were largely exploitative towards a population that had few other options. Though ethically bankrupt, these tourist Seminole camps foreshadowed the tribe's eventual role within South Florida's tourism and gambling industry.
 Tigertail was a tall, handsome, and personable man. A natural leader, he acted as a business liaison between many Native Americans and the white community. He stood as a bridge between both cultures. He grew to become a celebrity in Miami, culminating in the creation of the famous 25-foot, cut-out sign of Jack Tigertail, which was placed at the entrance to the newly developed Hialeah.
 Tigertail's untimely death at the South Bank of the Miami River in 1922 would prove to be one of Miami's most scandalous murders. Though never prosecuted, it is generally accepted that Charlie Veber, a man the Seminole referred to as "White Man Charlie," shot Tigertail in cold blood after he refused to sell Veber egret feathers he had gathered in the Everglades. Tigertail's death shook both Miami's white and Seminole communities. After some discourse as to where his body should be laid to rest, it was decided that he would be interred at Miami City Cemetery. Arrayed in his finest garments, he was laid to rest in a Seminole ceremony at Miami City Cemetery.

Markets are in retreat this week, with U.S. cases of COVID-19 surging to alarming new highs. Not only does the U.S. continue to have the highest number of COVID-19 cases in the world, but its 7-day moving average of new cases is soaring, and it also is the highest in the world. Oil prices continue to slide. Today, WTI crude futures prices opened at $36.07 a barrel—the lowest market opening in approximately five months. Currently, WTI futures have submerged below $36 a barrel, and prices already have been dipping below $35.50 a barrel. Last week, people in search of good news riveted on FDA approval of the antiviral remdesivir. Moreover, initial unemployment claims finally made a significant downward move, which continued this week. The oddments of good news this week, however, are overwhelmed by fears of a sustained surge of COVID-19, which already in some areas is overtaxing hospitals. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday before creeping back up modestly on Thursday. Early indicators point down today. ExxonMobil just posted a loss of $680 million in the third quarter, and Chevron posted a loss of $207 million. Both companies are cutting jobs. The oil complex is heading for another finish in the red this week.

Global operator Radisson Hotel Group has said it is ‘prudently optimistic’ it can recover from the COVID-19 battering within two years from now.


  That’s according to Radisson CEO Federico J. González who spoke at this year’s Future Hospitality Summit in Saudi Arabia. Joined by CNN’s John Defterios, and Cyril Ranque, president of Travel Partners Group, Expedia Group, the trio discussed the importance of planning in times of crisis.


  Recovery for the rest of hotel sector is forecasted for 2024/2025, said the group, citing figures from STR. Radisson, however, said they’re looking at a 2022 timeline thanks to drastic measures taken this year and a resilient development plan for the Middle East and other key markets.


  González said, “One of Radisson Hotel Group’s core beliefs are “we are many minds, with one mindset”. This time has most certainly proven that we need to stand together as we are all faced with common challenges. In times like these, we need to look ahead to the future, inspire our teams and remind them that there will be an end to this crisis, and that the hospitality industry will come back stronger than ever.”


  Once out the other side of the pandemic, Radisson is confident the industry will receive more investment into both its public and private sectors. Optimistic of recovery, Radisson has gone ahead with development plans in 2020 as part of an existing five-year game plan penned before coronavirus.


  Forty signings have been announced in 2020 so far, adding to the 1,100 hotels in operation and 300 in the pipeline.


  The CEO added that the Middle East region remains a key focus for Radisson – particularly KSA. With more than 20 hotels, resorts and serviced apartments in operation at the time of writing, Radisson Hotel Group aims to double its Saudi Arabia portfolio by 2025. It recently opened the Park Inn by Radisson Jeddah Madinah Road, with another opening coming up later this year, as well as the addition of five hotels to its portfolio in 2021.


  “We need to continue personalising the standards for our guests and working with our operational teams to deliver these standards. This will reinforce our image and position as a serious operator. Everyone will apply certain standards but what will be different is the “how” - how receptive we are to the consumer, and how quickly we can apply these standards. This will give us an advantage to attract more guests, investors, and hotels,” added González.


  Competitors Accor and IHG both posted Q3 2020 results this month, laying bare the impact of the virus.


  For Accor, revenue came in at €329 million, down by 68.7 percent as reported and by 63.7 percent like-for-like. RevPAR also saw sizable drops, falling by 62.8 percent in Q3 2020.


  IHG meanwhile reported RevPAR drops of 53 percent and an occupancy rate of 44 percent. RevPar was down 65 percent in the Middle East.


  Hotelier has not yet seen Radisson’s results for the quarter.

However, at the same time we know that there is a lot of story worth thinking about. Take, for example, this: Can they get more on the same page this season? We're hoping for more opportunities to see the two continually together at home, and also building even more of a life outside of their jobs. This is a big part of what we missed on this past season -- they were married, but a lot of their individual plotlines were about conflicts that the two had. Our hope is that this time, conflict can be replaced at times by triumphs and they can be a positive example for other Reagans who may be looking for relationships in their lives.

Trinity Church in Lubbock, Texas rallied to fund a total renovation of the 2000-seat worship auditorium that included a new Meyer Sound system based around LEOPARD linear line array loudspeakers. The world-class audio package was complemented by new video and stage lighting systems, all designed and supplied by Summit Integrated Systems of Lafayette, Colorado.

    According to Pastor of Technical Arts Michael Koontz, replacement of the aging center-cluster PA has brought focus and clarity to the worship services despite the room's problematic acoustics.


  "We have a dome-shaped ceiling which can really cause problems with reflections,"said Koontz. "And certainly that was the case with the old system. In many seats there was no sense of directionality, of a defined sound source. Sound was spreading out and bouncing off every surface. Now, with the LEOPARD arrays, we have a good sense of imaging localized to the front. Also, the arrays are hitting about six rows under the balcony, which means we needed fewer under-balcony fills."


  Removing asbestos "popcorn" from the ceiling actually exacerbated acoustical problems by increasing reverberation, but the precise directional control of the LEOPARD arrays circumvented any serious issues.


  "We had been advised to spend from fifty to a hundred thousand on acoustical treatment to control the room," said Koontz. "But with the new system's precise and controlled coverage we didn't really need it. That was a pleasant surprise."


  The new system comprises dual main hangs of nine per side LEOPARD compact line array loudspeakers, augmented on the extreme sides by pairs of UPQ-1P loudspeakers directed at the upper and lower seating areas. The UP-4XP loudspeakers deployed as front fill (8) and under-balcony delay (24) all incorporate Meyer Sound's exclusive IntelligentDC™ technology, combining the inherent performance advantages of self-powered loudspeakers with the installation ease of constant-voltage distributed systems.


  A Meyer Sound solution was preferred from the outset, based on both the church's positive experience with systems installed earlier in smaller rooms, and by Koontz's own prior experience.


  "Before coming here, I was technical director at Church on the Rock here in Lubbock where we had installed a Meyer MINA system for the 750-seat space," Koontz said. "We were extremely impressed with the headroom, transparency and speech intelligibility. So for this system, it was mostly a matter of scaling up to LEOPARD to fit the larger room."


  Joe Jones, the project manager for Summit Integrated Systems, was pleased by both the performance and ease of installation.


  "It has tons of output," said Jones. "Which allows the church to push the system without getting into limiting so the transparency is still there. We had no problems with weight, and commissioning went smoothly as we dialed everything in on the Galaxy processors."


  For Michael Koontz, the audio renovation has given the church's worship sound a warmer feel and more impact.


  "The difference in the lows is the most noticeable, as we can really control them better now," said Koontz. "We have much greater punch and tightness, and that carries through all the way to the back of the balcony. People are telling me, 'I can feel the music now.' Before we could get loud, but it wasn't balanced. It was too much mids and highs. Now we have it full and even, right down to the deep bass."


  The new LEOPARD rig joins two smaller Meyer Sound installations already in place. The chapel system deploys left and right clusters of one-each UPQ-1P, UPA-2P and UPJunior loudspeakers with bass from two 500-HP subwoofers. The elongated children's room is covered by three sets of one UPQ-1P over one UPJunior with lows augmented by dual 600-HP subwoofers.
