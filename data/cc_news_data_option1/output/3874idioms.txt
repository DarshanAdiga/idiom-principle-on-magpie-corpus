The Wisconsin Fair Maps Coalition is composed of over 20 nonpartisan, grassroots state groups, like the League of Women Voters of Wisconsin and Common Cause Wisconsin, and is working to build public awareness of the effects of partisan gerrymandering. Founded in 2017, the coalition supports legislation to transfer responsibility for the redistricting process to a nonpartisan commission after this year’s census and beyond. Along with public education, its key strategy has been getting Wisconsin county election boards to vote on resolutions, as well as through voter referendums.

 What the Democrats told us was Trump would do if he lost is exactly what they are in fact doing, not accepting the results. Has Trump done some good things? Yes. Has he done some questionable things? Yes. Should someone take his phone away from him? A big ‘Yes.’
 Now we come to the 2020 election season and the Democrats rolled out about 30 candidates and decided on Joe Biden, a politician for 40-plus years who claims he now has all the answers to fix everything. If he had the answers all along why did he not inform President Barrack Obama while he was vice president for eight years? Once again the Democratic party has wheeled out another weak candidate who in my opinion is but a puppet for Barnie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and The Squad.

If he truly does, then I wonder if “American values” are still centered around freedom, equality, and a government “of the people, by the people, and for the people”.
 Not because I disagree with the politics of conservative or liberal. I’m not categorizing people. There is no need, since most seem willing and proud to self-identify these days. Does anyone know any truly undecided voters for this upcoming election?
 But it is frightening to witness the hatred and blind loyalty that stems from much of the Trump base. Trump hasn’t placed that hatred there — he has merely harvested it like a skilled farmer. It was apparently always brewing beneath the surface. That it existed is no surprise, but the depth and breadth of it in what has long been considered “Mainstream America” is frightening and incredibly sad.
 They have used Donald Trump as a vessel to carry their hatred and racism and anger. They have enabled him, despite the fact the majority of the things he says are lies. They have engaged in a “the end justifies the means” relationship with him, and they both have profited by it.
 Trump isn’t creating this climate, he’s merely harnessing and riding it. After he is gone, that racist and opportunistic hatred will still be there, waiting to find another champion. That is America’s disgusting secret, which has now come out of the shadows.
 Donald Trump losing won’t fix all America’s problems, though it would be a great start. The real problems are not in our president, but rather in ourselves.
 Good people have to stand up and do the right thing. We have to make “American Values” mean something again.
 America has to work harder just to become what it has long claimed to be.
