Again, if this name doesn’t immediately ring a bell for you, it’s a guarantee that you’ve heard their work. Mixing classical music with rock opera, TSO is known for their albums of Christmas music. Songs like “Christmas Eve Sarajevo 12/24” and “Wizards of Winter” have been used in advertising and viral videos for years, and Greg eventually became one of the primary artists who contributed to the band’s mythos.

Mexican Defense Secretary Luis Cresencio Sandoval said Mexican traffickers import fentanyl from China and India and press it into ubiquitous blue tablets, and repeated Mexico's claim that there was "no evidence" that there were any labs producing the opioid in Mexico. However, he may have been referring to production of the drug from scratch; there is evidence that Mexican cartels import close precursor chemicals and perform the final stages of processing.

 "So I'm really happy to bring this wonderful person in as an add-on to the squad, which is just good for football reasons – but for all the other reasons as well. So, yeah, absolutely happy that he's here."
 Klopp has previously spoken about holding private chats with players before signing them to ensure they are on board with his project.
 "When we have this agreement, everything was fine, everything was good, that's why we talked, that's why we signed you, but from now on I expect much more," Klopp told Liverpool club media.

DeJoy’s background in the private sector has come under heavy scrutiny amid his tenure as postmaster general, as he’s garnered controversy by implementing changes at the USPS—which were recently struck down in federal court—that have resulted in nationwide mail delays and sowed fears about the November election. DeJoy has also come under fire for court documents alleging that DeJoy forged his brother’s signature while in the private sector in an effort to oust his brother from co-leading New Breed, as well as for a history of alleged worker mistreatment and his continued financial ties to XPO, which is a USPS contractor. The postmaster general has long been a prolific GOP fundraiser and Trump donor, and critics have raised speculation that DeJoy’s changes at the USPS were undertaken in conjunction with Trump in a bid to undermine mail-in voting, which DeJoy has vehemently denied. “It is easy to conclude that the recent Postal Services’ changes is an intentional effort on the part [of] the current Administration to disrupt and challenge the legitimacy” of the November election, U.S. District Judge Stanley Bastian wrote in a nationwide injunction reversing DeJoy’s changes.

She had two of her aces during that stretch in which Bryant built a 19-14 advantage, forcing a Cabot timeout.

As for that _Young Frankenstein_ poster the brothers painted over the course of that one frenzied night, that painting has since been lost.

But at the end of the day, he’s just thankful it served as a springboard to bigger things. “I have no idea where it is. Maybe Mel Brooks has it, I don’t know. But when people ask me who I’d like to thank about doing the _Star Wars_ poster, I do say Mel Brooks.”

You can feel that immersion in much of his work. Browsing through a selection of his illustrations, I’m struck by the sense of tactile warmth he’s able to bring to his images, as well as the striking action of the larger than life characters he captures – especially in the realm of Tolkien’s fantasies. After reading _The Hobbit_ and _The Lord of the Rings_ , Greg and Tim knew they wanted to work in that world in some capacity one day. He never got to meet Tolkien, who died just before they finally got the job, but in the late 1970s, they became famous for their work illustrating Tolkien calendars for Ballentine Books, which essentially turned them into rock stars in the fantasy art world.

But isn’t the act of illustrating sort of inherently un-cinematic? How do these guys plan to overcome that obstacle? They plan to animate some of his work to help bring it to life on the screen, but Burke has a more human answer as well. “Not only is Greg an absolutely wonderful illustrator, which allows us to lean into the magic of the worlds that he creates to create a visual sense of our own that in some ways mirrors that, even for a documentary…but also he’s a very, very compelling person with an incredibly interesting story to tell. At the end of the day for any documentary, it’s about making that human connection. Greg, for all his fame and celebrity and the otherworldly nature of his art, is still very much a human and a worldly man with a lot of interesting things to say and an incredibly interesting life story.”

Some companies are trying to address that. Walmart, Procter & Gamble and John Hancock, for example, have offered online camps and classes to keep children engaged. John Hancock’s camp included science projects, story time with the chief executive and pen pal buddies (3,000 children of employees participated).
 “That was real help,” said Erica Noble, a senior director for communications at Procter & Gamble. “Because flexibility helps, but at the end of the day, I have a 5-year-old and an 8-year-old, and they need something to do during the day.”
 Last spring, Kinesis, the Portland company, donated laptops for online learning and allowed flexible schedules. When it became apparent that schools wouldn’t open this fall, executives realized that wasn’t enough. The company hired a teacher for online school in its empty office space for the five school-aged children of its 13 employees so their parents could work from home without distractions. If child care centers close again, it plans to do the same for employees with younger children, probably by renting a house and hiring a preschool teacher.
 “It’s going away from saying, ‘This is your individual problem and your family’s problem,’ to saying, ‘We see this as a business problem we need to address,’” said Anja Taylor, director of operations at Kinesis, who is sending her two children to the makeshift school.

A RUGBY fan has been awarded €6,000 damages after a painful bang on the head from a level crossing barrier as he made his way to a Leinster-Munster match at the Aviva stadium. Iarnrod Eireann failed in its duty of care and was liable for what occurred, Judge Deirdre Gearty held at Dublin District Court yesterday/today (fri).Dublin Fire Brigade paramedic Rod Hayden sued after he was hit by a descending barrier as he was walked among a crowd of supporters making their way to the derby on Oct. 6, 2018.Mr Hayden, of Herbert Park, Bray, Co. Wicklow, told the contested hearing he approached the automatic gates of the Dart crossing at Serpentine Avenue, Ballsbridge, Dublin 4, and waited for them to rise.He told William Fitzgerald BL he then proceeded but before he got across he suffered a bang which knocked him rolling on the ground holding his head.He recalled he got a &ldquo;bit of a shock&rdquo; and he was dazed. He also noticed other people were still on the tracks between the closed barriers.There was a man in a high-vis jacket at the level crossing but he did not hear any warning.Afterwards he had extra neck pain and headache which got so bad he went to his GP. He was told he had whiplash and to take pain killers.He went to the doctor twice but by January 2019 he no longer suffered symptoms.CCTV footage was shown to the judge.Questioned by Iarnrod Eireann&rsquo;s counsel Brendan Savage, Mr Hayden said he crossed when the barriers went up. He did not hear a warning buzzer or see warning lights.As a fire-fighter paramedic for 17 years, he was trained to pay attention, he said.He agreed with Mr Savage that sometimes people have to take extra care and said that through his work he conducts dynamic risk assessments and gets alerted by a buzzer.He told the court he was observant and he tended not to do stupid things like scale through barriers.Engineer Neil O&rsquo;Carroll examined the scene later. He told the court that once the first barrier went up, pedestrians had six seconds before the second one started to come down. However, a crowd moved slower.The expert witness said the sound of the signal was also particularly low; it was a buzzer and not like a klaxon. He thought it was fine on a normal day but not very alarming in the context of a match crowd.He took a recording of the buzzer and found it was not as loud as the sound of passing cars. He told the court the plaintiff would not have been able to see the lights.One attendant managed the &ldquo;danger zone&rdquo; and it was not sufficient to to control the flow of traffic and pedestrians, the witness said.Because it was a match day, Iarnrod Eireann hired a security firm to have two attendants manage people and traffic at the crossing.One of them admitted he had moved out of position and he should have stopped the people.Legal costs, medical and witness expenses were awarded to the plaintiff.
