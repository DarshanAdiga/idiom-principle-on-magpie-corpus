More testing needed
   
 The stock market seems to be forecasting economic doom for, say, the rest of the year. But we can get control of the coronavirus way before then, at least enough to allow normal life to resume.
   
 Consider that the first coronavirus death in Italy was in Vo' Euganeo, a small town near Venice, with a population of 3,300. They decided to run an experiment that involved closing the town and testing all residents. They found 90 positives (about 2.7%), six of which were asymptomatic. They quarantined those 90 and retested all 3,300 residents two weeks later. The virus was practically gone.
   
 The lesson is two-fold. The first is that the virus can be quickly controlled via universal testing and isolating only those with the virus. The key is to identify the asymptomatic positives. But we don't have enough tests for the entire country. So in the short run we need data to target the testing.
   
 Enter Kinsa thermometers. They come with an app connected to your cellphone, allowing you and the company to store the data. More than 1 million units have been sold in the U.S. in the last few years. Kinsa assumes a three-day fever is the flu. The company "data maps" the U.S. by ZIP code and can use an algorithm to forecast a flu outbreak up to two weeks before the CDC does. It can subtract that forecast from the actual fever level in that ZIP code to get an estimate of the coronavirus there. (Obviously, we should all be sharing our thermometer results.)
   
 The second lesson is that until we get broad testing we can universally test smaller groups, thereby allowing much safer gatherings. It's easy to envision that we will soon divide ourselves into the "negatives" and the "untested." For example, you may need a recent test to gain entry to a restaurant or bar. How recent would depend on the forecast for that ZIP code. The situation vaguely reminds me of the early '80s, when singles (and hookers) carried herpes testing cards.
   
 Unfortunately, we don't have much choice in the short run. The shortages of tests and protective gear means we have to temporarily give up some freedoms in order to flatten the curve -- because the death rate is about 15% for those older than 80 and about 8% for those in their 70s.

 Follow health warnings
   
 When we are incompetent in our critical thinking and scientific knowledge, our incompetence robs us of our ability to realize just how inept we are, and we tend to overestimate our ability to deal with emergencies like this viral epidemic. We need to prepare for the worst and hope for the best. Our president should accept and acknowledge that there are people in the world whose expertise is greater than his, especially when he is gambling with our lives.
   
 After he criticized certain portions of the news media and called it fake news, it's not rational to expect people to follow his administration's health directives disseminated through them. On the opposite side, the media that called this a hoax is not going to be believed either. Maybe they will acknowledge their error and help the cause.
   
 Please follow the health warnings and remember that you are risking your life as well as others' -- including your loved ones.

 Not a funny 'View'
   
 "Another View" started out as a generally amusing opinion piece that poked fun at both liberals and conservatives. Lately, it has changed to contain primarily criticisms of President Donald Trump and conservatives in general.
   
 Your posting of "Another View" in the March 17 edition ("Empty Shelves") goes way beyond the boundaries of good taste and should never have been approved for publishing.
   
 In this time when the nation should be united as we face the coronavirus, it is disgusting that your newspaper published this "view." It was not funny!

LINCOLN - Lincoln Community Theatre announced Wednesday the postponement of its planned 2020 summer season and cancellation of any spring 2020 auditions.
 "At this time, we just know the health and well-being of our actors, technicians and patrons far outweighs the disappointment of moving our season," said LCT President Brandon Davis.
 "We will move those shows and their directors to the 2021 summer, but we also won't let Lincoln have a summer without fun entertainment," Davis continued.
 LCT will plan a summer showcase of fun, upbeat, lively selections from plays and musicals, and will feature scenework, dancing and singing scheduled for the end of July.
 As the LCT board is still in the works planning this showcase, auditions for the now-2021 shows will be held in spring 2021, and auditions for the showcase will be held in some format in early summer.
 Those who have purchased season tickets for the 2020 season will be contacted to carry over their tickets to the 2021 season or receive a full refund.
 More details will come soon about the showcase.

Former Rajya Sabha member Karan Singh on Friday commended Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s efforts to fight COVID-19 by announcing a 21-day lockdown and asked every citizen to support it.
 “The slew of measures taken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, including the 21-day lockdown, are to be commended and supported by every citizen. What is needed is that on the one hand the effective implementation of support projects for the weak and vulnerable sections — particularly the daily wagers — announced by the Finance Minister and, on the other, each citizen meticulously following the lockdown and social distancing instructions,” Dr. Singh said in a statement.
 It is only when the nation rallies as one that the Prime Minister’s commendable effort to eradicate the threat of coronavirus will bear fruit, Dr. Singh said.
 The former parliamentarian also asked every citizen to pray to the divine powers for inner strength and courage to face the challenge before humanity.

Casterline's view was that the Ravens asked for too much of a concession for an injury that really should not have been that big an issue.
 “They came back and tried to restructure what we agreed to, to really eliminate all risk," Casterline said, “and I just didn't feel like that was fair, especially when we had other people saying he would be fine."
 Shortly after the Ravens shut down the deal, Brockers agreed upon a contract with the Rams that Casterline described as “very close to what the Ravens initially offered."
 The 6-foot-5, 305-pound Brockers made the move from St. Louis to Los Angeles with the Rams in 2016, and he has started at least 14 games in seven consecutive seasons while playing all along their defensive line. Only long snapper Jake McQuaide has been the with the Rams longer than Brockers among their active players.

BOSTON - With one of the nation's hottest coronavirus zones just 200 miles southwest on Interstate 95 in New York City, Gov. Charlie Baker on Friday urged people who are thinking about traveling to Massachusetts to reconsider, and said that anyone arriving to the state through an airport or train station will be advised to self-quarantine for 14 days.
 "We're asking that folks considering travel to Massachusetts for whatever reason, do not travel to our communities, especially if you have symptoms," Baker said during his Friday morning press conference.
 The new guidance from Baker follows a recommendation from the White House coronavirus task force on Tuesday that anyone who has left New York or who has passed through through New York City on their way somewhere else self- quarantine for two weeks.
 On Friday, the number of confirmed novel coronavirus increased by 823 (34%) since Thursday to 3,240, according the state public health officials. That includes 10 new deaths bringing to total to 35. Middlesex County continues to lead the state with 685 cases, Suffolk County followed with 631 cases. Norfolk County had 393 cases and Worcester had 219.
 Baker on Friday also shot down President Donald Trump's suggestion that he would like to see the economy of the United States reopen for business by Easter Sunday, which arrives in two weeks on April 12.
 "Yeah, no. We're not going to be up and running by Easter. No," the governor said to end his daily briefing.
 The contradiction of the president by Baker was just the latest expression of frustration from the governor with the federal government's coronavirus response, which included an op-ed by Baker, a Republican, and New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, published in The New York Times pleading for more support.
 Health and Human Services Secretary Marylou Sudders said the Trump administration had come through with approvals for some of the state's Medicaid waiver requests to "fast-track MassHealth enrollments," enroll out- of-state providers, and to allow providers to be reimbursed for care delivered in alternative settings like tents or congregate care facilities. More approvals from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to ease restrictions on the delivery of care are expected by the end of the day, Sudders said.
 Baker said anyone traveling through Logan International Airport, Worcester Airport, South Station or one of the state's other transit hubs will be given fliers requesting that they self-quarantine for 14 days. The state will also be putting messages on electronic highway billboards along the Turnpike and putting notices at visitor centers advising travelers to self-isolate.
 "I would call it at this point instruction and advisory. There is no enforcement mechanism," Baker said.
 Asked if he had considered taking the temperature of people entering the state from New York or elsewhere, Baker said, "The answer at this point is we are engaged in discussions with a lot of people about what we can and cannot do, OK. And there are plenty of legal and constitutional issues involved in this."
 The self-quarantine advisory was one of several updates Baker provided Friday morning as the state neared the end of nearly three weeks under a declared state of emergency.

NEW YORK (AP) -- Congress has left cruise lines high and dry when it comes to emergency relief from the new virus outbreak. That sent shares of major cruise companies including Carnival, Royal Caribbean and Norwegian Cruise Line plummeting Friday. The economic-rescue package signed by President Donald Trump says companies getting loans or loan guarantees must be "organized" in the U.S. under American laws and have a majority of their employees based in the U.S. That knocks out Carnival, Royal Caribbean and Norwegian, all of whom are chartered overseas. Cruise lines have canceled many sailings and seen bookings drop since the outbreak started.
