and I'll echo what OP said about MS vs Google... I don't trust either of them in the slightest, they're both out to collect a dossier on all of our activities (and hardcore government collaborationists to boot), but at least we know what MS is because it's the same thing they've been since the 90s. There's somehow people who still think Google is benevolent and it blows my mind. I trust advertisers less than just about anyone, and I trust advertisers who make all their money from advertising while pretending to give away free stuff even less. MS is very direct; I use Bing, they track my shit, they give me rewards points per search, I redeem rewards points for Chipotle gift cards, the advertisers and three letter agencies get more input for their Big Data(tm) money pit time wasters, i get tacos, everyone wins. where are my damn tacos, Google?

Alan Griffin chose Syracuse University as his transfer destination to prove he can provide more than 3-point shooting, and the Orange aims to benefit if the junior seizes that opportunity.
 The 6-foot-5, 190-pound junior wing is expected to immediately slide into a key spot when the SU men’s basketball team opens the upcoming season at 3 p.m. Friday in a nonconference game against Bryant in the Carrier Dome. Spectators are not yet permitted due to state coronavirus regulations.
 The Orange has been on pause since last Sunday due to coach Jim Boeheim and one other member testing positive for COVID-19. On Saturday, a team official confirmed that Boeheim had completed his quarantine requirements and while they had yet to establish when practice will resume, SU remained hopeful of playing the season opener as scheduled.
 Griffin intends to fill a versatile role in his first season with the Orange, which returns five of the top six players from last year’s rotation and was selected to finish sixth in the Atlantic Coast Conference Preseason Media Poll.
 Griffin announced plans to transfer after two seasons at Illinois and joined SU in April. He enrolled for summer courses and was granted an NCAA waiver of immediate eligibility on Aug. 18. The chance for a more prominent and diverse position was the deciding factor, according to Griffin, who was also reportedly pursued by Duke, Pittsburgh, and Miami (Fla.) in the ACC.
 The opening for a well-rounded playmaker is ever present for SU after losing All-ACC selection Elijah Hughes, who scored 19 points per game to lead the conference last year and was selected No. 39 overall in the NBA Draft last week.
 “That’s why I chose Syracuse, to be able to be utilized on ball more,” Griffin said. “We just talked, and it really matched up accordingly to what I wanted. ... Obviously, we just lost a big piece, and just gaining another big piece.”
 Griffin averaged 8.9 points, 4.5 rebounds, and 18.1 minutes across 28 games last season, including one start, for the Fighting Illini. He made 47 total 3-pointers and led the team while ranking fifth in the Big Ten for 3-point field goal percentage (.416) to go with marks of .483 from the field and .861 on free throws.
 The Ossining native from a talent-rich gene pool ranked sixth nationally in offensive efficiency rating by KenPom last year and was also top 15 in the Big Ten for both offensive and defensive rebounding rates.
 Griffin credited SU assistant coach, Gerry McNamara, among others for working to help expand his game with the ball in his hands since mostly socially- distanced workouts started this past summer.
 “G-Mac has helped me and Kyle Feldman has helped me just seeing where I can attack and be where I’m able to use moves in-game on the court,” Griffin said. “That’s pretty much just showing that I can do more than just shoot the 3-(pointers). I’m going to surprise a lot of people with that.”
 Jim Boeheim already sees far more than a shooting specialist and credited Griffin’s energy and hustle during preseason practices, while emphasizing the importance of adding a proven college player.
 The Hall of Fame coach entering his 45th season at the helm compared Griffin’s approach to former SU fan favorite, Baya Moussa Keita, who played from 2011-14.
 “If you remember Baye, he was in every play, wherever the play was, he was in it, and I haven’t seen that many perimeter players that have that kind of motor where every play he’ll go after a rebound from 20 feet away and go get it above the rim, or a loose ball from 25 feet away,” Boeheim said.
 “(Griffin) is a huge motor guy, he’s after stuff, and then he’s still a skill player,” he added. “He shoots the ball well and makes plays, so he’s highly- skilled, ball-handling and penetration is what he’s working on, but I usually don’t use the words like high-motor guy, but he’s that guy. He gets involved in a lot of different things.”
 Griffin developed his relentless energy growing up as part of a decorated family of athletes, which does not include SU assistant coach, Allen Griffin as they are unrelated.
 The junior wing is the son of former Seton Hall standout, Adrian Griffin, who played a decade in the NBA and works now as an assistant coach for the Toronto Raptors. His mom, Audrey, was a college track star for the Pirates.
 His sister, Aubrey, is a sophomore forward for the Connecticut women’s basketball team while his younger brother, A.J., is a five-star 2021 forward who recently signed a national letter of intent to join the Duke men’s basketball team.
 “From my experience, don’t take a play off and just compete and go hard, that’s something I already had before going (to Illinois), just competing and playing hard,” Griffin said.
 Syracuse finished 18-14 overall and 10-10 in the ACC last year, advancing to the quarterfinals of the conference tournament before it was halted due to COVID-19. The Orange tied for sixth in the ACC and posted a winning record for the 50th straight season to extend the nation’s longest active streak.

NEW YORK (AP) — A man who prosecutors say was driving 97 mph (156 kph) when he caused a fatal crash in New York City has been charged with vehicular manslaughter, drunken driving and other crimes, Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz said Saturday. Alamin Ahmed, 22, of Albany, was arraigned in court on the charges Saturday in connection with the crash early Friday morning that killed Daniel Crawford, 52, of Bloomfield, New Jersey. Police said Crawford was driving to work at a Queens hospital at about 4 a.m. when Ahmed's Mercedes Benz barreled through a red light and smashed into Crawford's car. Authorities said a breathalyzer test showed Ahmed's blood- alcohol level was above the state's 0.08 limit for impaired driving. A judge ordered him held on $25,000 cash bail Saturday. “Few choices are more selfish than driving while under the influence of alcohol or drugs,” Katz said in a statement. “In this case, the defendant is accused of getting behind the wheel while under the influence of alcohol and criminally disregarding the rules of the road with tragic, deadly results.” No one answered the phone Saturday at the office for Ahmed's lawyer.

_Dragon Ball_ _Super'_ s newest chapter revealed how Vegeta can use his Spirit Control abilities in a new way. The newest chapter of the series officially brought the fight with Planet Eater Moro to an end, and it was just as messy as you would expect following the cliffhanger which saw Moro fusing himself with the Earth and becoming a threat to the galaxy as a whole. Following his major slip-up in the previous chapter, Goku found himself in way over his head and got some major help from Vegeta and his Spirit Control abilities.
 Chapter 66 of the series sees Vegeta return to the fight against Moro as he initially tries to use his Forced Spirit Fission technique to drain as much power from Moro as possible. But when he needs to help Goku re-energize himself to deal the final blow to Moro's forehead crystal, he quickly figures out how to do this in reverse and gather ki instead.
 Upon returning to the fight against Moro, Vegeta begins striking the ground with as many attacks as he can to try and drain Moro. Moro's new form, however, is absorbing the Earth's energy faster than Vegeta can drain it. This becomes a problem when Goku can't get close to Moro's crystal, and even powers down from his Ultra Instinct form as Moro drains him as well.
 Piccolo then asks Vegeta if he could use Spirit Fission in reverse to gather all of their energies to send it to the de-powered Goku, and Vegeta then realizes it's the same principle and this possible. Doing so sees Vegeta using a version of Goku's Spirit Bomb technique but it's just a massive ball of non- destructive energy that helps Goku get back to his full strength and take down Moro once and for all.
 0comments
 It had initially seemed like _Dragon Ball Super_ was going to sideline Vegeta following his rematch with Moro. He had gone through the effort of going to Yardrat and picking up a new technique, but it looked like Goku was going to save the day and thus making Vegeta's effort essentially meaningless. So the newest chapter bringing him back to the fight to play this key role is a way of building back some of this good will for Vegeta's training.
 But what do you think? Were you surprised to see Vegeta using a version of the Spirit Bomb technique? Curious to see how Vegeta's Spirit Control abilties will evolve going forward?

"Ghazals over guns!"By Priya MalikWith 2020 being a year that has unsettled even the most Zen of us, Priya Maliks says she is done with watching a world as dystopian as the one we live inWhen talking about two types of human attractions in A Suitable Boy, Lata the protagonist, quips "One that merely excites, unsettles and makes you uneasy, the other is a calmer, less frantic love" and when it comes to my viewing habits, I choose the latter!With 2020 being a year that has unsettled even the most Zen of us, I am done with watching a world as dystopian as the one we live in. The ghazals of Saeeda Begum sound far more escapist than the guns and sons of Mirzapur.Just like Lata's choice in love, I choose the less frantic shows. I loved Schitt's Creek, I hated Game of Thrones. I passed up on Money Heist but had a passionate love affair with Gervais' After Life. Mirzapur must be great. In fact, some of my favourite actors are in it but I was more moved by the poetic gaze of Daagh Saheb as he brainkisses Saeeda Begum with his eyes. I was more shaken by the platonic queer love between Daagh and Firoz. I was more taken by the restraint of Haresh for Lata and how he waits for her to make the final decision on who she chooses to marry!Each frame was a poetic metaphor based on Vikram Seth's novel about a newly-partitioned India coming to terms with its socio-political climate and value system. So, if you're a lover of history, a worshipper of poetry and a romantic by heart, I suggest you watch A Suitable Boy. And, when you hear them speak English and wonder 'Who talks like that?', you're right. This was a colonially hungover India of the '50s. Accept it and pay more attention to what is being said rather than how it is being said. Priya Malik is a comedian and poet who is known to speak her mind"The cliffhanger got me"By Karishma KuenzangFor Karishma Kuenzang, more than Kaleen bhaiya (Pankaj Tripathi) in Mirzapur - who was stellar - it was the character arc of his son, Munna (Divyendu), that made it a more gripping watchThe last weekend of October was packed with gripping content - perhaps the best coping mechanism during the pandemic - that came in the form of Season 2 of Mirzapur and Mira Nair's A Suitable Boy. Both released on the same day. But, on D-Day, and I woke up wondering about the cliffhanger Season 1 of Mirzapur left us, and before I knew it, I was on episode two, watching a detailed 'revenge' plot unfold. But more than Kaleen bhaiya (Pankaj Tripathi) - who was stellar - I was keen to see the character arc of his son, Munna (Divyendu). It was in Mirzapur Season 1 that I fell in love with Rasika Duggal, though she's also there in A Suitable Boy, but Beena Tripathi felt more empowering. And, of course, pandemic-appropriate and meme-able dialogue 'yeh bhi theek hai'.Also, I didn't mind the swearing. It is, after all, a reflection of reality. Mirzapur worked as it brought together my scattered thoughts with its gripping, well-paced storyline - there was never an inconsequential moment.Which brings me to A Suitable Boy, which I watched right after. The cast was exciting and the topic hit home. Unmarried women in India don't need reminders about the question, which creeps into conversations with family and friends (who have just finished watching Indian Matchmaking), no? Especially those who are done with finding 'a suitable boy' of their own.Karishma Kuenzang is a Senior Correspondent with HT BrunchFrom HT Brunch, November 22, 2020Follow us on twitter.com/HTBrunchConnect with us on facebook.com/hindustantimesbrunch

There's a special kind of sweetness in the cake baked by your landlady. No, this isn't a poorly translated old Russian proverb. It's simply a reflection on a rare city phenomenon - a cordial relationship between tenant and flat owner, specifically those who live in the same building. As Covid spread its unsanitised tentacles around the world, it also brought unlikely people together, united simply by their proximity to each other. A phenomenon my father, the master of the handy phrase, had many years ago described as "geo-personal".Love thy neighbour"I'm just a flight away" is one of the most poignant throwbacks to The Lost World of 2019. A world where crisscrossing airline routes, chaotic as a Jackson Pollock canvas, crowded our collective travelling consciousness. How carefree, how innocent, how naive we were. Now, it's either love thy neighbour or perish of loneliness. In the early days of the pandemic, the Italians overwhelmed us with their balcony concerts, shared with all the neighbourhood. As the boot-shaped nation attempted to stamp out one of the earliest European outbreaks, we saw videos of sopranos and cellists defying an indifferent nature with operatic resilience. A beautiful demonstration of what the idea of community can mean in times of alienation.Closer home, things weren't that bad. As my next-door neighbour and I bemoaned the absence of our shared cook, we exchanged little glass dabbas filled with our cooking. I believe I got the better end of the deal, responding to her tangy vindaloo with bland sprouts. And though I might not have had the luxury of a would-be Puccini wafting in from the balcony, my dusty, netted window allowed the piano notes of the building's resident musician to fly in on an afternoon breeze. Far from being buoyed, my heart sank every time she played her pet theme, which featured the doleful Celine Dion's heart "going on".Strange bedfellowsAh, the nostalgia of those summer months when I pierced the silence of lockdown evenings with nervous laughter and asinine questions on Zoom cooking classes with friends. ("Is this a clove?" asked a fellow student one evening, instantly filling me with delusions of grandeur about my own culinary abilities.) In this advanced stage of pandemic adaptation, it's all about social bubbles. Covid makes strange bedfellows. The freshly recovered hang together with an enviable confidence, united simply by the timing of their fall. High on antibodies, they look at the rest of the world with a barely concealed pity.Those who have dodged the disease have had to draw and redraw their social boundaries as skilfully as a gerrymandering US politicianThose who have somehow dodged the disease so far - or been blissfully asymptomatic - have had to draw and redraw their social boundaries as skilfully as a gerrymandering US politician. Long-planned meet- ups are (rightly) abandoned at the last-minute because of classified information about one of the meeters' safety lapses leaking. That acquaintance of many years who lives two lanes away and doesn't go anywhere - she's suddenly your back-up for those suddenly empty evenings. Just the idea that someone "safe" is a short walk away can keep you going; before you know it, Plan B is now your Plan A. Because this is the era of "geo-personal" relationships.So close and yet so farThat warm-and-fuzzy neighbourhood feeling has a downside. Stepping out of the house in these times is an act riddled with danger. Just across the street, the excellent masseur throws me a soliciting glance that I find so difficult to resist. A few hundred metres away, the guard at my favourite pub asks me why I haven't returned yet. Once I dodge these two trapdoors, I have ahead of me the landmine of my local cinema hall. This last temptation is easy to resist; they're currently playing such despicable movies, it seems like a Netflix conspiracy to retain their dominion over pandemic entertainment. In this atmosphere of constant doubt and debate, we have all learned to tell ourselves some comforting stories. Like stepping out to buy groceries in a crowded market is okay, but meeting a friend for a drink in a well-ventilated home is not. The logic behind this kind of abstinence might be questionable, but it makes us feel virtuous nonetheless. And with that I return to the landlady's cake and Celine Dion's laments while reassessing the contours of my geo-personal bubble.Follow @rehana_munir on Twitter and InstagramFrom HT Brunch, November 22, 2020Follow us on twitter.com/HTBrunchConnect with us on facebook.com/hindustantimesbrunch

We’re out of toilet paper again.
 Households across the U.S. are once again filling grocery carts brimful in a second round of panic buying as the virus surges and states clamp down on economic activity. Defensive purchasing is affecting everything from paper towels to bacon. Even the world’s biggest retailer is reporting shortages of high-demand items, including cleaning supplies, breakfast foods — and the most important commodity in any bathroom.
 “It really does have everything to do with what’s happening with COVID cases in any particular community,” Walmart’s chief executive officer, Doug McMillon, said on an earnings call in the past week. “We’re going to be able to respond in this instance better than we did in the first half of the year, although we’re still — as a total supply chain — stressed in some places.”
 The new wave of pantry stockpiling hits about eight months after the March boom, meaning makers of packaged food and household items have had some time to prepare. General Mills Inc. added 45 external production lines through contractors this year, while Campbell Soup Co. spent $40 million to expand production of Goldfish crackers, a must for parents cooped up with toddlers. Still, at-home demand is surging, accelerated by a new wave of indoor-dining bans.
 Cathy Smith had a pack of toilet-paper rolls in her cart at the checkout of a Ralph’s grocery in West Los Angeles at midday Friday with a few “last-minute” items to prepare her Thanksgiving meal, including a 16-pound turkey.
 “I’m not totally in panic mode yet,” she said. “I don’t watch the news, because it is too depressing, but my husband did and he warned me that things are getting worse. So I thought I’ll stock up.”
 Over the last three weeks, demand for nonperishable items such as paper goods, canned goods, spices, broths and canned vegetables jumped 60-70%, according to Centricity Inc., a platform that tracks online activity like searches and e-commerce.
 That’s on top of “meteoric” year-over-year increases for pantry staples, said Mike Brackett, Centricity’s chief executive officer.
 Shoppers may start to see purchase limits again, said Jim Dudlicek, spokesman for the National Grocers Association. Consumers should shop earlier in the day to “have best pick from freshly stocked shelves, but to be mindful of their neighbors and take only what they need,” he said. Some grocers are using social media to provide updates on hot products, and at least one is providing bulletins on a radio program.
 PUMPING CHEESE
 Kraft Heinz Co. CEO Miguel Patricio said in an interview last month that the company has been finding new partners and investing in the productivity and capacity of its factories to meet rising demand.
 That means “new machinery, or even bringing back to life lines that we considered in the past as obsolete,” he said. The company is working on “all possible fronts to increase capacity and we’ve been able to increase it substantially. We increased capacity on average by 20% and that goes up to 56% on products where there’s a higher demand,” like Philadelphia Cream Cheese or macaroni and cheese, he said.
 Mark Schiller, CEO of Hain Celestial Group Inc., said that the company, which makes Terra vegetable chips and plant-based Dream milks, was readier for this round of panic buying.
 “We are far better prepared,” he said. “We have about 50 million more dollars of inventory on hand, of all the things that have the longest supply chain and the least amount of backups.”
 ELUSIVE BALM
 Toilet paper is a tougher one to find, with consumers sharing on Twitter photos of bare shelves — and pleas to fellow shoppers to share the supply. “March 2.0,” observed one tweeter.
 Kimberly-Clark Corp., maker of Scott and Cottonelle toilet paper, said it was cooperating with its clients and customers to keep tabs on supplies and fill inventory gaps. The company has accelerated production since the pandemic hit, including making fewer variants of products and finding capacity in its global paper supply network, said Arist Mastorides, president of the family care unit in North America.
 Procter & Gamble Co. spokeswoman Jennifer Corso said the maker of Charmin continues “to work around the clock to produce product as quickly as possible.”
 “Paper towel consumption is related to increased cleaning situations, as consumers are cleaning more frequently,” she said. “Toilet paper consumption is tied to the increased amount of time consumers are spending at home. For both, people are consuming more and stocking their pantries at a higher level than before the pandemic.”
 BREATHE DEEPLY
 Panic buying is also hitting another part of the consumables market.
 Ben Kovler, CEO of Chicago cannabis company Green Thumb Industries Inc., said on an earnings call this month that while purchases aren’t yet back to March’s booming levels, it’s “marching back there slowly.”
 Unlike at Walmart, where shoppers are coming less often but buying more, Green Thumb’s Rise stores are seeing more customers, he said. And unlike staples that get used at a steady rate, when people buy twice as much cannabis, they quickly use it. These are, after all, stressful times.
 “They consume more,” Kovler said. “That’s not a bad thing for the business. We don’t think that’s a bad thing for the consumer.”
