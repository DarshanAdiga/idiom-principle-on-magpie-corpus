"Oh, man, I think for me, I don't know if I've, you're kind of called into ministry. You are not necessarily, you don't really choose ministry, I do believe it's a choice. But I knew, I didn't know it until I came down to Lafayette, Louisiana and our senior pastor, he took me out to lunch and I just came in to be a guest speaker. And he looked at me and said, there's more in you than what you think. I think we all need that sometimes. We all need someone to look at us and see that there's more inside of us than what we're just doing. And he knew, he said, there's a pastor inside of you and I want to help you with that. And when he said that, something just clicked and we left all our friends, family, (and) everything we knew in Georgia and moved and took that leap of faith to Lafayette. And when I lived in New Orleans with the Saints, I had no idea where Lafayette was. I had no idea where Youngsville was. It was not a place I said I wanted to go raise my family. It just wasn't it just wasn't in the cards, but I just knew it when he said those words, your call to be a pastor. I knew that was what I was supposed to do. That that was my calling. And I knew it right then and there. And I think it was one of those things. I just had to say yes and trust that the rest of it God was going to take care of it. And I'm so glad that I said yes and took that that leap because when I did, it was the best decision for me and for my family moving forward."

"I mean it helps, especially when you're a New Orleans Saint, a Super Bowl champion. And it helps that people just want to come say hi to you. And I get to share with them a greater purpose than just football. And it helps in a lot of respects, it obviously helps with the platform number one, but I would say the second thing is one of the things that I know very well, that translates from football to ministry is teams. I know what great chemistry looks like, I know that team is supposed to look like. I know how to include people and engage people for a higher purpose to think not just of yourself on the team, but think of the greater good. And so there are tons of aspects that transition there from a team and a leadership aspect into even the business world or the ministry world for me, because what I'm doing is very similar. I have a goal that I am trying to accomplish, right where in football, you're trying to win a games. In ministry you are trying to win people to God. And that's the hope of it and that's the cool thing. There's so many parallels and so I'm trying to build a team to help go out and equip them to go and win the game and to help other people and it's just this great, beautiful chemistry between being a leader on the field and then being a leader then again in ministry or in business or whatever that you're doing. There are so many aspects of leadership that transition from the football field and from the NFL onto there and it gave me some skills with dealing with people and everything else that I wouldn't have had anywhere else and so I'm super grateful for my time in the NFL."

"When I lived in New Orleans, I didn't know about Cajun culture. New Orleans is such a melting pot of people. It's so eclectic. It's great, it's an amazing city, but when you move out into the Acadian area, in Lafayette, Louisiana and Youngsville, you understand it's true Cajuns out here and I'll say this right now, they're the most hospitable people you will ever meet in your entire life. So being an outsider, it is a culture shock to say the least when you come in to these areas and you're trying to understand the dialect of what they're saying and the culture around you. But it was never a struggle for me and my wife and my family because in all honesty, they are the most hospitable people and they would welcome you into their home, cook you a meal, everything revolves around food. Everything is so rich and decadent and amazing, and they're just amazingly nice people. So we didn't have a problem, especially being a New Orleans Saint, we didn't have a problem with kind of fitting into the culture. Our kids now use some of that Cajun dialect like, come see, I didn't even know what that meant. Come see is just come here. Little things like that where my kids are starting to talk like that. We've had three children that have been born right here in Lafayette. So for that, it's very interesting. Our kids are starting to pick up that Cajun dialect and the culture as a whole. We just feel like they've welcomed us in and now we're a part of the culture and we're here and that's what's so that's so great about it. It's home and we love saying that."

LOUISVILLE, KY (WAVE) - Black artists and restaurant owners in Louisville can apply for a grant tailor-made for their community.Fund for the Arts said it has funds for all individuals, but right now they said the Black community needs support.Art is visible all across Louisville, but supporters of local creatives said the faces and talents behind the brushes hold value and play a role in the impact of the work.The Fund for the Arts Foundation is creating space for Black people to use their creativity during the current racial and health pandemic. Ashley Cathey used blocks of color to add a burst to Logan Street in Smoketown. She said she painted her family who lived in Shepherds Square before it changed. She painted a mirror for the next generation.“I wanted to give an affirmation that you can do what you want,” Cathey said. “I am, I can, and I will.”A student watching her create reinstated Cathey’s purpose.“She just was so happy,” Cathey said. “‘[I can’t believe] that you’re out here doing this. You look like me’ and that lifted me in that moment and made me feel like I’m doing this for you all. I’m here to represent us.”Fund for the Arts created the Individual Black Artists Fund and Black Culinary Arts Fund for Black owned restaurants.Fund for the Arts Senior Vice President J.P. Davis said it is doubling down on equity. He said it’s time to support the Black community and an equitable society.“Specifically targeting Black communities, black artists, black owned restaurants, because at the end of the day the time is now for us to all play a part in moving forward,” Davis said.The grant will provide five $15,000 grants for restaurant owners to help with cash flow and make sure they stay open and up to $2,000 for artists.Cathey is one of the artists applying. Davis said the foundation wants to lift Black voices and talent because artists are creative first responders during a crisis.”What artists do in times of need is roll up their sleeves and they’re the ones coming up with solutions,” Davis said.“Speak through your work and not have the resources or the funds be a factor in that,” Cathey said.The right words are not always there, however Davis and Cathey said the grant will help artists continue to create the right message.Davis said right now a certain amount of money is available, however if the need is there, the foundation will raise more money.Applications are due within the next two weeks and are available by clicking here.Copyright 2020 WAVE 3 News.

As simple as implementing a new cleaning agent might seem, the task did not come without obstacles. “The greatest challenges during this process were determining where three percent hydrogen peroxide was acceptable for use,” Raines said, “and who would perform the work necessary to implement it as a cleaning solution for areas potentially exposed to COVID-19.” Thankfully, her team’s devoted members were able to overcome this and implement it.
 While the Mid-Atlantic Regional Materials Test Laboratory (Code 134) is in the process of diluting and bottling hydrogen peroxide for the new disinfectant, the only thing left in the codes’ endeavor to put it into action is the green light. “Once we receive the sign-off, we will issue the change to our procedure and three percent hydrogen peroxide can be implemented for COVID-19 disinfection in work areas,” Raines said. “Additionally, the Nuclear Facility Maintenance Branch (Code 2380.5) is in the development stage for their procedure to implement three percent hydrogen peroxide as the primary disinfectant in their work facilities.”
 Raines stated that the three percent hydrogen peroxide spray initiative would not have been possible without the help of multiple departments. “Code 2310.4 led this initiative,” she said, “but between Nuclear Material Analysis Branch (Code 2305) Head Gerry Zaner obtaining hydrogen peroxide and spray bottles from suppliers; Job Readiness Cell (Code 530) lead and COVID-19 Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Zone Manager Mark Ragsdale maintaining bottles of three percent hydrogen peroxide for general shipyard use; Occupational Safety, Health, Environmental (Code 106) providing safety background knowledge; and Nuclear Engineering and Planning Department’s (Code 2300) Department Director Curt Hart, Division Head Mike Kwiatkowski, and Ventilation Support Rob Harrington who propelled the process forward, this was a true product of team effort!”
 In working to put the spray into effect, the opportunity to demonstrate the C.O.R.E. value of Care and protect others from the virus was not lost on the team. “We have this virus going around and it is tough because you may not even know if you have it for a two-week period of time,” Raines said. “That’s why it is important that we have this disinfectant spray because not only is it cheap, safe, and easy to obtain, but also it enables us to effectively prevent the spread of COVID-19.” A product of care and teamwork, the new peroxide spray will help keep the virus away and allow employees to stay safe at NNSY!

US President Donald Trump loves the people of India and China and wants to do "everything possible" to bring peace for them, according to his spokesperson.Over the past several weeks, the senior members of the Trump administration has come out in strong support of India against China's aggression along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh."He (Trump) said I love the people of India and I love the people of China and I want to do everything possible to keep the peace for the people," White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters at a news conference here on Thursday.She was responding to a question on Trump's message to India, which recently had a violent standoff with China in eastern Ladakh along the LAC in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed. The Chinese military also suffered casualties but it is yet to give out the details. Welcoming the White House statement, Al Mason, co-chair of the Trump Victory Indian American Finance Committee, said that unlike his predecessor, President Trump has come out openly in support of India."Most of the Indian-Americans have observed that every earlier president - be it a Democrat or Republican, like Bill Clinton or Bush Senior or Bush Jr or Barack Obama have been very scared to side with India openly, for fear of hurting China."Only President Trump has had the courage to say that… I love India, America respects India… US stands with India - and that also, to over one billion Indians in India at the Namaste Trump rally held in India… and that too… near India's neighbour China," Mason said in a statement. "And he is consistent in his love for India and Indian- Americans," he added. Earlier on Thursday, White House Economic Advisor Larry Kudlow described India as a great ally, saying President Trump is a great friend of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Marbury’s life throughout the film shows his family’s love for him which kept him grounded. Once Marbury declared for college the intense pressure for him to become successful increased. Many players would collapse under that pressure, but Marbury only elevated his game at Georgia Tech. After one year, in 1996 he finally saw his hard work pay off and was drafted into the NBA.
 The NBA dream that he work so hard for to give his family the life he always spoke about would see many road blocks. The film carries you into the dark days of Marbury career, the impact of the death of his father and clashes with coach Larry Brown that led to bad blood. From the outside looking in the media at the time painted a problematic Marbury. The loved he once received from fans and the media all but disappeared. This began to chip away at Marbury’s spirit. He would spend five years with the Knicks and a brief stint with the Boston Celtics before he retired from the NBA in 2009. The film then takes you inside Marbury’s bouts with depression and inside very public erratic behavior.
 What might seem like a curse to most turn into a blessing for Marbury. The guard was offered opportunity to play basketball for the Chinese Basketball Association. Marbury moved to China and was born again. All the negative press and lost admiration from fans was gone. China welcomed him into their basketball family and country with open arms. A much needed shot of confidence that Marbury needed at his lowest point. In 2015, Marbury received a Chinese green card and became a permanent residence. After earning three championships in China Marbury would suit up for his last game in the CBA in, 2017.
 The film appropriately closes out back in Coney Island with Marbury in a barbershop talking to a young boy named Xavier. Telling him he can be more than just a basketball player. He can become president of the United States and help his whole neighborhood. Marbury fondness for Bruce Lee’s, famous quote about water is shown to young Xavier on his cell phone. “Empty your mind, be formless, shapeless — like water. Now you put water in a cup, it becomes the cup; You put water into a bottle it becomes the bottle; You put it in a teapot it becomes the teapot. Now water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend.” After a fresh haircut young Xavier is given Marbury signature part in his hair. Marbury has become not just, “A Kid From Coney Island” he has now become the lifelong teacher that many young players need.

"They should be following the science and they should be following the evidence," Jha explained, before highlighting the case of Georgia, where that state's governor, Brian Kemp, is clashing with local officials for his prohibition on mandating masks. "And the coronavirus task force recommendations are that. So, for a place like Georgia, for instance, their recommendations are very clear that there should be a statewide mandate on wearing masks and that in the red zones of Georgia, there should be no gyms, there should be no bars. And they encourage governors to allow localities to have even more restrictive policies. Again, it's a very science-based document coming out of the task force. I was thrilled to see it. And then, of course, I was puzzled that it is both being kept as a secret and that governors are defying or just ignoring it."

AUGUSTA, Maine -- Schools that return to in-person instruction this fall must follow health and safety precautions that include the use of face coverings, Gov. Janet Mills said Friday.
   
 An updated framework published by the Maine Department of Education also requires schools that decide to return to in-classroom instruction to set up symptom screenings, maintain physical distancing within school facilities, practice proper hand hygiene, wear personal protective equipment when in close proximity to students and remain isolated at home if sick until meeting established criteria to return to school.
   
 To help cover the cost of complying with the added safety protocols, the state will direct up to $165 million in federal CARES Act funding that was authorized for distribution to Maine school systems, Mills said, characterizing the funds as "start-up" money to help get schools back up and running.
   
 "We will distribute these funds based on an equitable, weighted formula," Mills said. "I recognize that more assistance may be needed by schools."
   
 Additionally, the Mills administration will use a three-tiered health advisory system to help guide school boards and superintendents in their reopening plans, Mills said. The system will advise that counties in Maine are categorized as "red," "yellow" or "green." Red means in-person instruction should not be conducted, yellow means a hybrid instruction model should be used and green means in-person instruction can be adopted.
   
 The tiered system, developed by the Maine Department of Health and Human Services and the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention, will take into account public health metrics on a county-by-county basis and translate them into the three categories, which will be updated regularly.
   
 During a televised press conference Friday afternoon, Mills pushed back against President Donald Trump and U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy Devos, who have insisted that schools reopen for full-time in-person instruction this fall and threatened to withdraw funding from schools that decline to do so.
   
 "For the sake of Maine children, their futures, and the livelihoods of Maine families, returning to classroom instruction when it is safe to do so must be our shared goal," Mills said. "But that goal cannot be achieved at the expense of peoples' health and safety, regardless of what the Trump administration says. I want students, parents, teachers and school staff to feel safe and confident in returning to school."
   
 The three-tiered health advisory system will be posted on the Maine Department of Education website beginning July 31 and updated on a biweekly basis, according to an announcement from the Mills administration.

We are in uncharted waters, we need leadership to think outside the box in all areas of government, this will take a leader to work with our community's leaders, our experts in our private sector and a leader that can motivate our entire county government staff. We need to expand our medical capabilities,we can't just rely on the University of Hawaii for all of our medical training . We need to partner with other outside collages and universities to increase the ability of our local Island students, job workforce, and other career changing local people to improve our nursing,med tech and other medical related fields. As I said I'm coach a master of getting the most of my players, I make a promise of getting this job done.

 “It took Steve Rowley 40 years to build that scouting network; it did brilliantly, got the best players from around the world.

In light of the new ICE crackdown (now, fortunately, abandoned) on international students, universities may be further compelled to adopt insurance policies to buffer future falls in revenue from shrinking international student bases. The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign did exactly that in 2019, in response to the flaring U.S.-China Trade War. While larger universities were being lauded for creating safety mechanisms to retain international students, they are only doing so because these students are a principal source of revenue.

This final theory wrapping up the analysis of The Lighthouse theories goes hand in hand with the other ideas because they both touch on desire. Without mythology and psychoanalysis at play, the A24 movie is still an intriguing image of man’s complex desires and how giving into them out of anger or boredom does not end happily. The lighthouse itself could be seen as a symbol for desire. Ephraim is trying to reach it the entire movie and once he looks into it it does not give him what he wants. The lighthouse itself is an object of desire for seafarers to give them a sense of security. In the long run, a lighthouse cannot save you from the unforgiving sea though. So it's this empty desire.

Thornberg argues much of the economic loss is not tied to anything fundamentally wrong with the economy.
 “The economy right now is like a hot air balloon tethered to the ground,” he said. “That tether is the virus. When the virus goes away, the balloon is going to shoot up into the air.”
 Not everyone is as confident about an economic rebound with the U.S. labor market showing lost momentum in the past month.
 An analysis by The Wall Street Journal found job openings were down in July as Google searches for “file for unemployment” were up. Job openings were not tied exclusively to where the virus is growing most, in the South and West, leading some economists to tie the recovery mainly to consumer confidence.

And I suspect I’ve spent 40 years studying ambiguous loss because I don’t like ambiguity. I remember when I first went to the University of Wisconsin in Madison, in one class or another, we were describing each other. And somebody called me decisive. And I took that as a high compliment. [ _laughs_ ] I don’t, anymore. I’ve come to believe in both/and thinking, which I write about. I don’t like binary thinking, unless you’re working with your banker or someone like that. There’s a middle ground, a middle way to go, when you’re dealing with people and when you’re dealing with problems. We have huge problems right now. And to say that someone was wrong when the pandemic began, about what they thought about it — a scientist — and now they think differently, that’s binary thinking. And I can’t take it anymore.

"It's amazing to see. I was there and started in 2007. So just shortly after kind of the franchise started to get started with Sean (Payton) coming in and they kind of built a foundation of great character guys that kind of flew under the radar, but they got some some great character guys. My first two years with the Saints, we were average, I say we were average. I think we went to the playoffs once, maybe. We were average. People will always ask like what happened in that 2009 season? I don't know if I know the answer to that. I don't know if any Super Bowl team knows the answer to the formula behind what makes a great team a great team. I think there's this chemistry that happens that is almost supernatural in what takes place. For us, we just knew it, everything was clicking and then afterwards, people look at you differently. When you go through something like that and you win a Super Bowl, when you go 13-0, lose your last three games and then just absolutely run the gamut in the playoffs and then in the Super Bowl takeover that way, people look at you differently. They took New Orleans' franchise for real and they said this is a real contender. It kind of erased the 40 years of past that we have had since 1967, it kind of erased that. Everybody forgot about that kind of and just going, this is super bowl team now and they look at it as such and even now we've come close. In the past 10 years, we've come close, we've almost gotten there. But even still people see us as a contender and it all changed after the 2009 season and what a blessing it is to be a part of a legacy, a legacy for New Orleans, the city and the organization as a whole. To be able to be that legacy and now people look at you differently. They don't just look at you, oh, New Orleans is the easy win, but now we're going to have to fight and claw and do everything we can to beat these guys because they're a contender and it's not just about one player in Drew Brees. It's about an entire team, an entire organization, entire city. People can't stand coming to New Orleans and playing in the Superdome and that's because of the great fans that we have. It's just an all-around different mindset where now when people look at New Orleans and think about the New Orleans Saints, I'm humbled to be a part of that legacy that still continues to this day."

The fire on the 844-foot ship began around 8:30 a.m. Sunday and sent acrid plumes of smoke into the San Diego skies for two days. By Tuesday morning, the plume was noticeably smaller, although the smell of the fire stayed in neighborhoods nearest the base through Thursday.
 Firefighting crews from a dozen San Diego-based ships — more than 400 sailors — assisted federal firefighters from bases throughout Southern California fighting the fire. Navy helicopters from Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron 3 dumped more than 1,500 buckets of water on the ship around the clock. Tug boats also shot water onto the ship, cooling the ship’s hull.
 Several photos of the damage to the ship’s “island” superstructure and interior were posted online over the last two days, showing entire spaces blackened by fire and smoke, as well as at least two large holes in the island’s roof. The forward mast — located on the island — collapsed early Monday.
 Sobeck explained Thursday that the damage to the island is due, in part, to the material with which it was constructed.
