  # Easton's Shannon Johnson named Mass Golf Women's Player of the Year


  Jay N. Miller


  Correspondent


  For all of the uncertainty and upheaval surrounding all sports in 2020, it's turned out to be the most accomplished year in the golfing career of Easton's Shannon Johnson, who calls Thorny Lea in Brockton her home course.


  Last week the Massachusetts Golf Association named Johnson its 2020 Women’s Player of the Year, or more precisely the Anne Marie Tobin Women's Player of the Year. It's the third time Johnson has won the award, and she also took home the Women's Mid-Am Award, which is determined by a combination of performance in the Keyes Cup tournament, and the 36-hole Stroke Play for the Mass Women's Amateur Championship.


  Johnson's golfing journey seemed to be peaking in 2018, when she won the U.S. Mid Am, a highlight in the Easton resident's glittery record of achievement. But 2019 turned into a year of what-ifs, when she just couldn't maintain that high level of play.


  "I definitely played to some of my best-ever scores in 2018, and to win a major like the U.S. Mid-Am is really something," said Johnson, 37, this week. "But it also puts added pressure on you with everything you do after that. It didn't seem that things were really that different to me, but I was probably putting added pressure on myself. The tournaments all seemed to come to a head in '19, when I really didn't feel I played as well as I could have."


  "I was looking at 2020 as a chance to reset," said Johnson. "But then of course the year began with such uncertainty. I turned my front yard into a chipping area, and that was about all we could do. There was a five- or six- week period there where we were all unable to play at all, just not able to hit full shots. Competition started up again in May, but we had played in no tournaments at all, and playing practice rounds is okay, but doesn't put you in the same mind-frame. The first couple of months were tough, because you were coming right out of the gate, right into competition."


  The first real competition was the New England Women's Amateur, held in early July, at North Conway Country Club in New Hampshire, where Johnson did pretty well, and finished as runner-up. Right after that, Johnson combined with her Thorny Lea friend, Megan Buck, to win the inaugural Mass. Women's Four-Ball, at Haverhill Country Club.


  "Yes, my first tournament was the New England Am, just before the Fourth of July, in New Hampshire," Johnson recalled. "It ran just about perfectly for me, and I was second. Right after that we had the Four-Ball at Haverhill, which also went well. I then had the U.S. Women's Amateur, at Woodmont CC, (Maryland) near D.C., the second year of my two-year exemption from winning the Mid Am in 2018. It was a nice thing to experience, but I had only had one (individual) tournament before that, so I was kind of rusty."


  It was when Johnson got to the Women's Mid Am at Essex Country Club that she really felt like she was hitting her stride.


  "The Mass. Am at Essex was the tourney where I really got into a groove," said Johnson. "I really enjoyed that one. Then it was on to the MGA's Stroke Play Championship (The Baker Trophy) at New Seabury Country Club. Because this is such an odd year, there were no age restrictions, so we had a bunch of juniors playing in it as well. That's unusual, since they're usually in school, but it made it more fun. It also kind of helped to make it a full field for the tournament, so that was really nice, and I won that."


  Johnson might be too humble to note it, but this was her fifth Baker Trophy. Then, Johnson won the Keyes Cup at the Mass. Women's Mid Am held at Black Rock CC in Hingham, a victory sparked by her five-under par opening round of 66.


  "Black Rock is a fun course," said Johnson. "Unfortunately, I was not able to get a practice round beforehand, so my first round there was my first time even seeing that course. It was a treat nevertheless. My 66 was an interesting round; you never know how you will do when you haven't seen the course. I started off just okay, playing cautiously. It wasn't until the back nine that I really started to make birdies. I had a streak of birdie-ing five out of six holes on that back nine. Sometimes, it's funny, if you just stay within yourself, it can be an easy game."


  Johnson works by day for Ping Golf Equipment, covering the Metro Boston and Rhode Island territory, so her work gets her plenty of opportunity to meet and interact with other golfers and golf pros, so she's been getting congratulations this week. Most years she squeezes in a few winter trips to Florida to keep her game sharp, but this year that is also in doubt.


  "Megan Buck and I signed up for the U.S. Women's Four-Ball down in West Palm Beach, but now I guess even that is up in the air," said Johnson. "Usually I will go down to Florida in January, February or March, once or twice, but that's not looking likely the way things are right now. I have played more practice rounds at Thorny Lea this year than I probably ever have before. Normally I have been working at home, and last spring I did play a decent amount of times through May and June, so it wasn't like a massive task to get ready. But unless there's that competition, and tournament sense of focus, it's just not the same. One good thing is that there is such a slew of great golfers at Thorny Lea that I can almost always find some tough competition for a pick-up round."

Sixteen and zero.
 It was such an unlikely journey, a person would have needed to be well- polished in the theatre of fantasy just to create the outline for a far- fetched story.
 But in four-part harmony — something so pleasant it would make chorus teacher Debbie Gouge smile from ear to ear — Elizabethton’s school system, Coach Shawn Witten, his players and staff and a gem of a community meshed together and helped the Cyclones navigate the menacing pandemic waters.
 At the end of this improbable accomplishment was a second straight Class 4A state championship. It was signed, sealed and delivered Saturday afternoon in Cookeville with a 41-14 blowout of Haywood.
 Yes, Elizabethton’s record will stand at 15-0. But for each of the six public- school state champions, an extra victory was needed in 2020.
 Elizabethton not only defeated every opponent it faced throughout the season, the Cyclones did it against the odds: playing high school football in an unstable world.
 “They are a bunch of resilient young men,” Cyclones’ head coach Shawn Witten said. “We focused on each player’s needs. We loved them and cared about them. The guys prepared and never allowed pressure to build up, and they never let frustration get the best of us.”
 As late as August, the Cyclones were like everybody else. They didn’t know if they were going to play one game, let alone 15.
 Consider for a moment how difficult it is to win a state football championship in any year. Elizabethton went 81 years between its first and second one. And last year seemed more like an everything-fell-into-place dream march.
 But with a bullseye squarely on its back, Elizabethton tried to do it again while also facing potential pitfalls — not just every week, but every day.
 Elizabethton Director of Schools Richard VanHuss said it was amazing what the student-athletes went through to get to Cookeville.
 “It all started with (principal) Dr. Jon Minton, athletic director Forrest Holt, and Coach Witten,” VanHuss said. “It was constant communication all the way through. We had some kids miss games, but we made it through this type of year without catastrophe and without having to shut the program down.”
 Even up to the final game — learning from the harsh lesson of what happened to McMinn County in the Class 6A playoffs when it forfeited to Dobyns-Bennett — Minton traveled to Cookeville prepared to produce seating charts, game and practice films and anything that would help with contact tracing if needed.
 “We tried to cover every single base,” VanHuss said.
 VanHuss stressed how impressed he was with Witten being able to juggle the typical wall-to-wall duties of a head football coach during the season along with the daily issues of the pandemic.
 “It’s hard enough to be a head coach in the middle of a normal season, trying to focus and win a state championship,” VanHuss said. “Now you add this layer, and to do it under these circumstances is incredible.”
 Van Huss said Witten was meticulous about finding ways to keep his program afloat. Included in the mix was having the players get dressed in shifts so they were able to maintain social distancing in the locker room, and being very aware of who the players were around on a daily basis.
 “It was incredible the lengths they went to,” VanHuss said. “The work behind the scenes of Coach Witten and the administration was unreal.”
 Of course, it took extra effort from the student-athletes, their families, and the community, too.
 “Everybody did their part to try to make this happen,” VanHuss said. “People stepped up because they love these kids so much.”
 Witten said the players deserve a lot of the credit.
 “They dealt with all of the restrictions, temperature checks, masks, and those things,” Witten said. “When we had away games, getting on buses and traveling never fazed them. The kids realized what they had to do to defend their title, and they never lost focus. I’m so proud of them.
 “Our community is a special one. They got behind us. These last 24 months have been really special.”

CALISTOGA -- Stemming from litigation dating back to 2008, the City of Calistoga is confronted again with a long-standing threat from an environmental group over the operation of Kimball Dam.
 Grant Reynolds, a director of Water Audit California, delivered a letter to the City of Calistoga on Monday criticizing the city for not fulfilling its commitment to complete a “stream study … and other aspects of its commitments.”
 According to the letter, the City adopted an interim bypass plan in 2011, with the intention of meeting demands and ending the litigation.
 Since then, “From Water Audit’s extensive review of documents produced in reply to a public records request, from our review of other public records, and from our inquiries to the regulatory agencies, it appears that nearly a decade later Calistoga still has not completed the promised stream study. Other aspects of its commitments under the Plan are apparently also incomplete,” the letter states.

Public health recommendations do not have the teeth of an order, in that there is no penalty for not following it. However, the recommendation shows that officials like Riddell are serious about limiting social behavior.
 “This is a targeted intervention with a limited timeframe and clear goal,” he said. “Let’s come together to help our hospital, so it can remain available to help us in turn.
 “We did this in the spring and effectively eliminated detectable COVID from our community,” he said. “We can do it again. Please, let’s save lives and our winter economy.”
 In response to a question posed by Town Councilor Jonathan Schechter about what steps needed to be taken over the next couple of weeks to flatten the curve of infections, Pond said people need to follow the health recommendations.
 Wearing masks whenever in public or in close quarters with other people is an issue that has “been settled” and demonstrated as an effective deterrent for transmission of the coronavirus, Pond said.
 “They work,” she said, “but it doesn’t work if you don’t wear a mask.”
 Pond pleaded for people to take personal responsibility, particularly with Christmas break approaching.
 Mayor Pete Muldoon went a step further. After reading aloud a submitted comment from Mike Kitchen of Teton Pines Resort and Country Club, in which Kitchen said the resort was suspending reopening of its dine-in service to help the community get past the pandemic, Muldoon proposed that other restaurants also voluntarily halt dine-in service.
 “Do the right thing,” Muldoon said. “You can tell the community that you’re doing it so you can give back. The community will remember your business for doing that — your employees will sing your praises and redouble their loyalty — and our community will be safer.”
 During the afternoon briefing, Beaupre said St. John’s Health expects to received 976 doses of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine sometime in the last week of December. Only 220 doses will be available for Teton County, with the rest to be distributed to outlying counties.
 It’s expected that the Moderna vaccine will be available shortly after the Pfizer vaccine, Beaupre said. He characterized that as good news because, unlike Pfizer’s vaccine, the Moderna shot does not have to be stored at minus-90 degrees Fahrenheit, and can be reconstituted and administered more easily.

They say it will be up to incoming President Joe Biden to push for another broader stimulus in 2021, if he can win support from the new Congress.


  “The pain of the American people is driving this, and I’m optimistic that both those leaders will come on board,” said Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), a leader of the effort.


  Lawmakers were closing in on the final language that would provide roughly $300 in extra federal weekly unemployment benefit and more money for the so- called Paycheck Protection Plan that allows businesses to keep workers on the books.


  Key issues in dispute include aid to local governments, many of which are facing cataclysmic budget gaps, and a GOP-friendly liability shield that would prevent workers or customers for suing companies who give them COVID-19.


  Both sides acknowledge that a new round of $1,200 checks will not be included in the measure.


  The package to be released Monday would be attached to a larger year-end spending bill needed to avert a government shutdown this coming weekend.


  The direct payments were popular when they were first distributed after the pandemic hit, and Biden on Friday had expressed hope that a second wave might come after weekend negotiations.


  Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) said leaving out the checks was the only way to reach agreement with Republicans, who are refusing to budge on the bill’s final price tag.

This past weekend at Mass, our pastor, Rev. Michael Alber, spoke about how we frequently defer to organizations to help those around us who have some type of need.
   
 How often do we donate our money to some charity and never give it another thought about those in need? We donate money; therefore, we have done our part. The thing that most resonated with me was the idea that maybe it's time for us to stop passing the buck to organizations and to start looking around our own community and helping those who have some need.
   
 For most individuals, 2020 has been a year with many challenges, which makes it even more important for us to be aware of the needs of those around us.
   
 Take a moment to think of those living right in your neighborhood, or right here in your own community who may have some special need at this time. I am sure it is not too hard to find any of the following:
       A widow, widower or an elderly couple who is feeling isolated and alone. Find a way to reach out and let them know you are there, whether it is a nice chat on the phone, sending a card or letter, or if they are tech savvy, help them set up a Zoom meeting.   The single parent who has been working long hours trying to make ends meet. Go shopping and purchase things that help meet their most basic needs such as cleaning supplies, groceries, and laundry detergent; and a little extra cash would be most welcome.   Medical personnel who may not have a financial need but may be exhausted from working long hours dealing with COVID patients. Make and deliver a meal with all the fixings.   Police, fire and ambulance personnel who can never be thanked enough for all that they do for their communities. Send a thank you note and let them know they are appreciated for their service.   Teachers and school support staff who have been working under extreme stress since last March. A note of thanks with any little gift of appreciation goes a long way.     
 We, as individuals, or in small local groups, can go out of our way to say "thank you" to those who have been under a lot of stress throughout 2020.
   
 Shop locally keeping in mind that many small business owners are struggling as well, and then use those purchased items to build up and show appreciation to those living around us.
   
 Who doesn't appreciate a gift certificate to eat at a local restaurant, a cup of coffee or hot tea, a bottle of wine, some type of service, or other treat?
   
 By taking the time to go out of the way to recognize those who may be struggling in some way, you give the greatest gift you can possibly give this holiday season, and that is the gift of hope.
   
 We all can be that person; we do not need others to do it for us. May God bless your holiday season and go make a difference.

 "They're not always as high as the ones I wear for show. But I'm little. I'm short. And I have to wear heels in order to reach my cabinets," she joked.

A top 10 of the AP college football poll with Indiana and Iowa State is something never before seen.
 The eighth-ranked Hoosiers and No. 10 Cyclones both moved up two spots in the Top 25 on Sunday, heights those programs have not reached in decades.
 The last time Iowa State cracked the top 10 was 1992, when the Cyclones reached No. 9 after a 6-1 start to the season that included an upset of Nebraska. Iowa State finished that season 1-6 and unranked.
 The regular season is over for these Cyclones (8-2). Their next game will be in the Big 12 championship game against No. 13 Oklahoma.
 It has been even longer since Indiana was ranked this highly. The Hoosiers peaked at No. 4 in 1969, when they last played in the Rose Bowl. That prize is off the table this season because the Rose Bowl is hosting a College Football Playoff semifinal. The Big Ten championship game could still be within their reach, depending on what happens with Ohio State and the conference's minimum games rule.

"I want that for Christmas," I says to my beloved wife, Marsha, pointing at a vintage car going down the road.
   
 "Right. But why?" she says.
   
 "It's cool," I say. "Wouldn't we look good driving that in a parade?"
   
 "Where would we keep it? How would we pay for it? Who'd take care of it? Do you know anything about fixing cars? Why would you want to drive in a parade instead of watching a parade?" she rattles.
   
 "Gee! Such a Negative Nellie!" I say.
   
 "I'm being practical," she says.
   
 "It's really nice that some people restore and maintain old cars," I say. "But you're right. I don't want to be one of them."
   
 "Too bad you can't buy a brand-new car that looks like an old car," she says.
   
 "You can," I say. "They make these things out of fiberglass that look just like the old cars but with safety equipment, air conditioning, new motors, new everything. Let's get one."
   
 "Sounds expensive. Where would we keep such a thing? Who'd take care of it? Why would you want to drive in a parade instead of watching a parade?" she says. Again.
   
 "Just a pipe dream," I say. "I'm not serious. What I'm going to do instead is buy a backhoe. It'd be a ball to play with one of those."
   
 "Good grief," she says. "And I suppose you want an old army tank, too?"
   
 "Yes," I say.
   
 "Here's a compromise," she says. "I'll buy you a skateboard for Christmas."
   
 "OK," I say. "And a vintage car, a tank and a backhoe?"
   
 "Nope, but I'll throw in a pair of crutches," she says.
   
 "That's mighty generous of you," I say. "What would you like for Christmas, besides jewelry?"
   
 "I don't need any jewelry," she says.
   
 "Sure," I say, remembering the time I bought her a new plastic cutting board for Christmas and had to buy jewelry for the next decade to pay for that mistake.
   
 "What I mean is, I don't need any jewelry right now. Maybe later," she says.
   
 "I knew that."
   
 Marsha and I have birthdays three days apart with Christmas right in the middle, so gift-buying-and-giving tends to be frenetic. Sometimes we buy each other One Big Present, and sometimes we even put our heads together and purchase One Big For Both of Us present. Like a cruise we took a few years ago, for example.
   
 My mom, may she rest in peace, always felt guilty about my Christmastime birthday and wanted to swap her August birthday with me. I had to remind her that the day I was born was a LOT harder on her than it was on me, so she deserved the August birthday and I settled for the Christmas one. Marsha's mother was also born in August, but she had the good sense to hang on tight to her own birthday. She deserved it, as she had Marsha and my mother was stuck with me.
   
 My older sister, Susie, has perfected An Amazing Eye Roll when I tell tales of my growing-up years. She was a good child. I was not. I gave my parents gray hair and stomach pain, but I have the excuse of an untenable Christmas birthday while Susie was born in July, which is much more civilized. Marsha was, by all reports, also a good child in spite of her yuletide birthdate, so you may think that this disproves my excuse for poor behavior. It does not.
   
 Her parents were classical musicians. My parents played jazz.
   
 One excuse is as good as another.

What changed? Two things, said the Speaker. A vaccine appears nearing delivery. And Joe Biden won the White House.
 "That was not a mistake, it was a decision," Pelosi said of her choice to demand for months a deal three times as large as what she's now settling for. "That is a total game changer -- a new President and a vaccine."
 The political point was probably the real game changer. Congress passed the CARES Act -- the most recent significant COVID-19 package -- in March, and lawmakers and the administration have been haggling over its successor ever since. It wasn't certain that Biden would defeat President Donald Trump, so Democrats were treating this as their one shot at big-ticket items. With that assumption, Pelosi moved forward a sweeping set of proposals that at first were in the ballpark of $3.4 trillion. Pelosi had held firm that a CARES Act sequel must swing for the fences, including money for pension stabilization, college-loan forgiveness and a postal bailout.
 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell hung back, saying he would defer to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin to suss out a deal that Trump would sign. As talks continued through the summer, the sticker price fell to $2.2 trillion. Then, with the election nearing, Trump blew up the talks and ordered Mnuchin to suspend negotiations, only to reverse himself on Twitter soon thereafter.
 Pelosi's midsummer calculation wasn't necessarily wrong. Parts of the broadest proposal were incredibly popular and would have been politically easy to pass, such as a moratorium on evictions and delayed deadlines to repay student loans. But some of the thornier items on the Democrats' agenda, like a soil conservation pilot program and tax deductions of teachers' out-of-pocket expenses on classroom supplies, might have never made their way past Trump and Republicans. By lumping it all together, Pelosi anticipated an easier pathway for the latter. In other words, she needed to package the chocolate cake with the steamed broccoli to get the whole meal out of the kitchen.
 Biden has urged Congress to do _something_ now and they can try again after he is sworn in on Jan. 20, including, perhaps, getting some of the less popular items passed in a future round of funding. "President-elect Biden has said this package would be at best just a start," Pelosi said on Friday. "It is less money, but over a shorter period of time, and we need to do it to save lives and livelihood with the hope that much more help is on the way."

Facing global anger over their initial mishandling of the outbreak, Chinese authorities are now trying to rewrite the narrative of the pandemic by pushing theories that the virus originated outside China.


  In recent days, Chinese officials have said that packaged food from overseas might have initially brought the virus to China. Scientists have released a paper positing that the pandemic could have started in India. The state news media has published false stories misrepresenting foreign experts, including Kekulé and officials at the World Health Organization, as having said the coronavirus came from elsewhere.


  The campaign seems to reflect anxiety within the ruling Communist Party about the continuing damage to China’s international reputation brought by the pandemic. Western officials have criticized Beijing for trying to conceal the outbreak when it first erupted.


  The party also appears eager to muddy the waters as the WHO begins an investigation into the question of how the virus jumped from animals to humans, a critical inquiry that experts say is the best hope to avoid another pandemic. China, which has greatly expanded its influence in the WHO in recent years, has tightly controlled the effort by designating Chinese scientists to lead key parts of the investigation.

ADRIAN -- There's been a lot of businesses at 110 E. Maumee St. over the years.
   
 It's been a hardware store, a bookstore, a tea room, a shop for menswear, even Adrian College's business offices at one time. Most recently it was Ricketts, Ricketts & Associates.
   
 The building has changed hands numerous times, but its occupants have always been a part of the Adrian downtown community. Always.
   
 Or at least as far back as historical records go. The earliest picture of 110 E. Maumee St. is from 1856.
   
 A local trio is leaning into the community fixture concept with The Buzz Cafe and Marketplace, one of downtown's newest businesses. A cafe and grab-and-go market hybrid, The Buzz opened Nov. 28.
   
 The shop offers soups made from scratch along with salads, sandwiches, Great Lakes Roasting Co. coffee and breakfast fare. There are also gluten-free bread options.
   
 The grilled cheese and tomato soup combo has been an early favorite.
   
 The Buzz is the end result of a three-year construction project and an even longer planning phase for owners Joyce Miller and Ben and Deveny Rosebrock.
   
 Miller met the Rosebrocks when she co-owned Sass. They met during First Fridays where the Rosebrocks would promote their business, Treat Handcrafted Confections.
   
 Miller had always wanted to have her own small business, maybe a coffeeshop. The Rosebrocks specialize in sweet treats. Coffee and chocolate? A perfect combo.
   
 Miller and her husband, Chris, Adrian's former economic development coordinator, purchased 110 E. Maumee and live upstairs. Together, along with the Rosebrocks and a few others, they would embark on what they call a "deconstruction" project.
   
 Plenty of sweat equity went into creating The Buzz.
   
 "When you walk in, you feel a little bit of the love we've put into this place," Ben Rosebrock said. "This space means more to us than the restaurant we've created."
   
 The building was gutted all the way down to the original floor boards, which is what customers see when they walk in. They are various shades of brown, some even black. A spot on the floor in the back says "1856 ... ish," a nod to the longstanding building.
   
 Ben learned how to clean bricks on the wall with a wire brush, one by one.
   
 A completely new facade features windows inviting those passing by to watch as Ben makes his signature fudge. A deliberate design move, the "performance area," as he calls it, is in the front of the shop.
   
 If that wasn't enticing enough, the vents are positioned in such a way that the chocolate aroma flows out and into downtown.
   
 A staircase was even removed from what is now the center of The Buzz and repurposed to lead to the basement. Tax prep service Ball D A Associates, a holdover tenant from before The Buzz, was given its own entrance at the back of the building, which required the removal of bricks. The staircase leads to the basement from that office.
   
 Much of what was removed was repurposed with some materials going to Goodwill and Lenawee County Habitat for Humanity. Other materials are on display inside The Buzz, such as the thick slabs of wood on top of the stools one can sit at if they want to have lunch while overlooking downtown.
   
 "There are some amazing timbers to come out of this place," Ben said.
   
 If one is looking for a more comfortable seat, there's a space to read and play board games, which will be available once The Buzz can offer dine-in.
   
 In the back is the marketplace. There's a little bit of everything, from fruits and toilet paper, to chips and jars of jam. Miller said the idea is based on what those who live and work downtown might need on their way home. Instead of an out-of-the-way store run, just pop on into The Buzz.
   
 The Buzz name is a double entendre. There's the "buzz" one gets from drinking a coffee and the "buzz" of being a community hub. Owners hope the latter flourishes once they fully open.
   
 Miller envisions customers coming and going while others chat over coffee or work on a laptop. No matter who stops in, owners want them to have a feeling of belonging. No off-putting looks or feelings of "Who are you?"
   
 A customer experience, not customer service, as Deveny describes it.
   
 The owners also want to promote other Adrian businesses. The Buzz staff will be trained to recommend a good place to have dinner, grab a drink or catch a show.
   
 Art featured on The Buzz's walls come from local artists and is for sale. The cafe has partnered with the Adrian Center for the Arts to serve as a show gallery.
   
 An old piano holds the coffee mugs for the shop's mug club. Purchase a one- year membership and receive a ceramic mug made by local artist Dennis Swartzlander along with coffee discounts.
   
 "It really is our mission to be a community organization," Ben said.
   
 One might say there's a buzz already. Feedback has been overwhelmingly positive and other businesses have given The Buzz a warm welcome.
   
 "It's been really, really great," Deveny said.
   
 The Buzz is open 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Thursday, 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Friday and Saturday and 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Sunday. The shop can be found on Facebook at The Buzz Cafe and Marketplace and online at thebuzzadrian.com.

The Heat acquired Iguodala in a three-team trade in February, and as he regained his footing, the coronavirus pandemic suspended the season indefinitely.


  Iguodala, the first vice president of the National Basketball Players Association, helped coordinate the season’s restart in a bubble environment at Walt Disney World near Orlando, Florida, collaborating on protocols for a return and fielding phone calls from concerned players.


  Some voiced hesitation, worried that resuming play would distract from calls for social justice after the police killing of George Floyd in Minnesota.


  The NBA’s return featured Black Lives Matter wording near center court, and many players wore league-sanctioned messaging on the back of their jerseys.


  “You do see the sports leagues taking more of a stance,” said Iguodala, who chose to have “Group Economics” on the back of his jersey instead of his last name. Iguodala added that for leagues with a majority-Black workforce, like the NBA: “I think there’s a moral compass there. And so you have to take some type of stance. And it’s not really a political stance — it’s a human stance.”


  Then, in August, Iguodala became one of the most vocal players during a series of meetings after the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin.


  The players initiated a work stoppage of playoff games until the league’s franchise owners agreed to specific commitments, including searching for ways to provide voting access to underrepresented communities.


  “How you get so many African American athletes of that wealth to be able to come out stronger as a whole, as a union, that was a beautiful thing, regardless of what people may have thought would happen,” Iguodala said. “Just seeing all of us being able to have dialogue, whether we agreed or we disagreed with one another, that was huge.”


  Iguodala ended the season in his sixth consecutive finals, where Miami lost to the Los Angeles Lakers in six games.


  “The bubble was the perfect environment for us, because of how they mentally train the guys to take on any challenge,” Iguodala said. “We were just ready for it, and we made the most of it.”


  Iguodala is also making the most of his off-court pursuits. He was an early investor in Zoom, the platform he used to conduct the interview for this article. He joined Comcast Ventures’ Catalyst Fund as a venture partner.


  His goal is to continue educating, creating access for and investing in minorities and marginalized communities. In other words, backing up the message he wore on the back of his jersey.


  “Professional athletes have too much down time,” Iguodala said. “That’s how they get in trouble. What I’ve been able to do is take that time and find something that’s purposeful and it’s a passion, something I really enjoy, and not just monetize it, but also help bring my cohorts into the space with me and help them learn as well.”


  Iguodala and Stephen Curry teamed with Bloomberg LP in 2017 to create the annual Players Technology Summit, a forum to link athletes with executives in technology and venture capitalism.


  “People don’t realize the potential athletes have to learn, given the fact that they’ve been professionals in this one discipline for such a long time, from basically childhood,” said Rudy-Cline Thomas, the founder of the venture capital firm Mastry and Iguodala’s longtime business partner. “The potential for learning something outside of that is extremely high.”


  As Iguodala’s basketball career winds down — “sooner rather than later,” he’ll be able to focus on other things, he said — he wants to make sure other players recognize their value on and off the court.


  “We always talk about player health physically and mentally, but ultimately, that No. 1 agenda is the dollars and how much can we bring in,” Iguodala said.

NEW YORK (AP) — With coronavirus vaccines on the horizon, details of how most Americans will get their shots are still being worked out. If a federal panel gives Pfizer's vaccine a thumbs-up this week, the Food and Drug Administration could green light the shots soon after. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says health care workers and nursing home residents should get the first limited doses. States will ultimately decide where the shipments go. The shots should be free to everyone, and officials say they plan to have them widely available by the middle of next year.

With the COVID-19 pandemic surging and causing more restrictive public health measures, three North County moms created a product that adds a decorative touch to hand sanitizer dispensers.
 They launched a business, Sanbox, that sells wooden covers that each have designs, short sayings or other adornments and fit over typically bland- looking dispensers. The company also offers custom options.
 One of the company’s founders, Sarah Longwell, said the product is an improvement to the dispensers, which can be an “eyesore” in homes or businesses.
 “We thought, wouldn’t it be great to have a sanitizer dispenser in your home so it’s easily accessible?” said Longwell, who lives in Solana Beach. “You could come in from running your errands or whatever and sanitize easily.”
 She added that they wanted to “keep it fun and less industrial” to improve the look of the standard dispenser, many of which are plain white with a logo on the front.
 “We’re really passionate about staying healthy and safe,” Longwell said. “When you start welcoming people back into your house, it’s kind of an awkward thing to have a sanitizer at your door like businesses are doing. It’s just a way to take the intimidation out of it and just keep everyone a little safer, a little healthier.”
 The idea for a business grew from the positive feedback she and her cofounders, including her sister, started getting when they created their first few iterations and began using them.
 “It kind of just organically started,” said Em Doyle, one of the other Sanbox founders, who lives in Del Mar. “People were asking us if we’re on Etsy, if we’re on Amazon. We had to get it together pretty quickly and give it a go.”
 The packages they sell come with a hand-sanitizing dispenser and materials needed for installation. Some of the company’s goals include looking into other types of materials and introducing the product to schools, many of which have been trying to balance in-person and distance learning over the past several months.
 “We’re looking at different materials, looking at different special edition type ones,” Doyle said. “We do have a lot of things in the pipeline.”
 They’re also looking to the upcoming holiday season as an opportunity to promote the new product and grow their customer base, especially as more people are bracing for the surge in COVID-19 infections and taking steps to protect themselves and their families.
