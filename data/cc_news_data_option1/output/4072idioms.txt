The Obama administration also came under fire for its immigration and detention policies, with lawsuits over the practice of holding families in detention centers as well as the conditions at such facilities. By embracing a more hard-line policy, the Trump administration has set off speculation that it's using the threat of separating families as both a deterrent to immigrants and a political tool in the hopes of reshaping U.S. laws.

This isn't the first time the pad has hit the market lately. Earlier homeowners Scott and Barbara Lloyd, who referred to as the place dwelling for 4 many years, listed it in August 2015 and, in response to the Day by day Information, had a heck of a time discovering a purchaser. Although it was the second most-clicked dwelling on Realtor.com that 12 months, apparently the overwhelming majority of on-line guests have been cinephilic lookie-loos hoping to catch a glimpse of Buffalo Bill’s pad, or extra particularly, his basement. The Day by day Information surmised that the property’s distant location deterred patrons – in addition to the truth that there's just one toilet on the premises (now that’s downright scary!). I’m positive the connection to at least one of filmdom’s most annoying killers didn’t assist issues. At one level PETA expressed curiosity in buying the dwelling and, per a letter Govt Vice President Tracy Reiman wrote to agent Dianne Wilk, turning it into “an empathy museum for animals abused and killed in order that others might put on their skins.” (The verbiage virtually makes Buffalo Bill’s predilections appear tame against this!) The concept by no means got here to move, although.

RAPID CITY — A runner-up finish in the sixth flight of singles by sophomore Jaida Young was one of the final-day highlights for Watertown High School’s girls tennis team in the state Class AA tournament on Friday.


  The Arrows, who hadn’t played in nearly three weeks before playing in the two-day tourney, finished sixth out of 12 teams with 194.5 points. Four of Watertown’s singles players and two of its three doubles teams placed.

The counterculture in Britain was small and isolated – intellectual and well- to-do – there was nothing similar to the stridency and potency of the student movements elsewhere. However, the historical watershed that was the 1960s and its legacy – and the tipping-point that was 1968 – can still be seen, albeit transformed, today. Martin Luther King’s assassination shifted the civil rights movement into something altogether more radicalised and militant. In 1968, Eldridge Cleaver published the seminal text _Soul On Ice_ , placing the Black Power movement in the foreground of African American political engagement. In Memphis, striking black workers marched silently in protest with large placards slung around their necks proclaiming “I am a man” in foot- high letters. It’s not a big jump to Black Lives Matter.

Ironically, a recount did end up changing the vote totals in one state: Hawaii. When the state finally finished counting its votes, on November 16, Nixon led by 141 votes. Given the Republican challenges elsewhere, Democrats called for a recount, which began on December 13. Fifteen days later, a judge ruled that the state’s electors—at first awarded to Kennedy, then reassigned to Nixon after auditing mistakes were found—was rightfully Kennedy’s all along. The result of all the Republican lawyering and politicking had been a net loss of three electoral votes. “The recount in the one state the Democrats asked for turned from Republican to Democrat,” Kennedy press secretary Pierre Salinger noted dryly, as if suppressing the temptation to gloat, “and nothing happened at all in the 11 states that they were going to seek recounts in.

Dominic Sandbrook, in his remarkable and compendious history of the era, _White Heat_ , plausibly advances the key moment as something less ephemeral, occurring in January 1965 when Winston Churchill – who was born in 1874 – died. With Churchill’s death went the last symbol of British Victorian imperial hegemony, and all the national myths constructed around him, and by him, suddenly lost their objective correlative. We were just another mid-sized country slowly sliding down the road to relative powerlessness and moderate influence. It was time for a change and the change duly occurred, but not in the way the rest of the word experienced it. Sandbrook comments that, “Bearing in mind [Britain’s] self-conscious traditions of conservatism and pragmatism, the relatively comfortable conditions in the universities, the rather gloomy stability of its political life and the long continuity of its institutions, it is hardly surprising that Britain did not witness vast protests to compare with Paris in May 1968.”

I'd never heard of the 1984 book "The War with Grandpa" by children's author Robert Kimmel Smith. I only knew that Robert De Niro played the grandfather in the film and that it was a comedy.      Yes, Robert De Niro does play the grandfather. It's not very funny. I have no plans to read the book.      A Google search showed that age recommendations for the book are 9-13. I'd lower those ages for the film, probably from 6-12, but no younger because the content is a little dicey when it gets around to kids pulling dangerous pranks.      Those 6- to 12-year-olds will probably lap up the shenanigans on display. But I just couldn't cotton to any of it (save a good De Niro performance). Some of the story is fun and, OK, some of the slapstick bits are funny. But there are far too many that aren't, and too many border on being cruel (not funny).      The protagonists are 12-year-old Peter (Oakes Fegley, terrific in "Wonderstruck"), and his grandpa Ed (Robert De Niro, darn good in "Taxi Driver"). Ed is a recent widower, now living alone is a house filled with memories. He's convinced by his daughter Sally (I didn't recognize it was Uma Thurman till halfway through) to move in with her, husband Arthur (Rob Riggle), Peter, and his younger and older sisters - cute Jenny (Poppy Gagnon) and boy-crazy Mia (Laura Marano).      The seeds of the tale of conflict are found in the parents' decision to put Ed in Peter's bedroom, and consign Peter to the unfinished attic. Peter is not thrilled. In fact, since he's 10, and maturity hasn't quite set in, he's angry - selfish without realizing it.      His friends at school, upon finding out about the dilemma, persuade him to go to war with grandpa, with the goal of getting his room back. Peter slips a scrawled Declaration of War under grandpa's door (the spoils of it being his room). At the same time, Ed's local longtime pals Jerry (Christopher Walken) and Danny (Cheech Marin) are shown the Declaration, and convince him that he must "respond to this sort of aggression."      That's the whole movie. Peter is a nice kid, Grandpa is a nice guy. Peter becomes incensed at the unfairness of the situation and stops being nice. Grandpa tries to calm him down. Peter won't be calmed.      Bring on the pranks, initially small-time innocent stuff like an alarm going off at 3 a.m., which escalates to booby traps that toss grandpa up in the air and down on the floor. The antics go back and forth, and are joined by pratfalls, forced overacting (except for De Niro, who manages to keep some dignity in his role), mood swings that turn on a dime from resentment to adoration on the part of Fegley, and the pointless presence of the annoying older sister who, I've since been informed, isn't even in the book.      There's also the question of what the heck Jane Seymour is doing in the film, as a new friend of Ed. It's a thankless part that gets her involved in a "winner takes all" seniors versus kids trampoline dodgeball game, with Pete's bedroom as the prize. I somehow made it through the tortuous, slo-mo, knockabout sequence and then, for you, dear reader, backed it up and watched it again, this time with a stopwatch. It lasts six long minutes, plenty of time for a bathroom break.      Things get serious. Ed orates a message to Peter: "War is no game. Only kids and fools and generals think that. War hurts and wounds and kills and causes misery. We've gotta end this somehow."      They do, but not before the film dips into a predictable and vanilla birthday party sequence for little Jenny, and then conveniently but unconvincingly ties up all of the story's problems in a big bow.      "The War with Grandpa" opens in theaters on Oct. 9.      Ed Symkus can be reached at esymkus@rcn.com.      "The War with Grandpa"   Written by Tom J.

ALLEN, DOUGLAS KENNETH LAIRD June 24, 1930 - October 2, 2020 It is with heavy hearts that the family of Doug Allen announces his death on October 2, 2020. Doug was the beloved partner of Ruth MacLean. He was predeceased by his wife, Frances and son, Sean. He leaves his daughter, Kelli, grandchildren Kristen, Ashley, Jessica, and Cassidy, daughter-in-law, Sue Allen and Scott, Bruce and Heather MacLean. In 1952, Doug graduated from University of Toronto School of Architecture, Landscape and Design. In 1963, he established the practice of Allen and Sherriff Architects Inc. which continues to this day. Doug's athletic endeavours were many. He travelled the world and paddled some of the world's greatest rivers. In squash, he was founding President of Richmond Hill Squash Club, three-time Ontario Masters' Champion, twice Canadian Masters' Champion, twice US Masters' Champion, silver and bronze medalist in World Masters' Championships. He was four-time Canadian Champion in flat-water canoe racing. He is a lifetime member of the Richmond Hill Canoe Club and Richmond Hill Squash Club. He climbed Mt. Kilimanjaro in Africa and Mt.

He was the founding President of Schools for Children of the World Canada. Through this organization, over thirty schools have been built in Central America. A high school is currently being built in Honduras, already named The Doug Allen School. Known for his warm sense of humour, Doug was a true Renaissance man. In addition to his architectural career, he was an artist, a benefactor, an entrepreneur, a skier, a golfer, opera buff, lover of Scotch, cigars and Porsche cars. Doug was not only the light of our lives – he was the shining north star that guided and motivated us. His mantra was "The More you Live, the Less you Die". There will be a private graveside service.

At this point, we're outside the prison where the convicted killer is being held, Ahmed Barakat, a distant relative of Halla and orouba who authorities say killed them in a crime of passion, a dispute over money. We were finally about to find out his side of the story. Okay, that was fast. He answered the questions. He did, yes. Ahmed only speaks arabic. Ahmed wrote out his responses. We had a translator read them in the car. You've been convicted of murdering Halla and orouba, did you do it? He just said, I did not kill anyone. In his written responses, Ahmed said he was innocent of everything. If you did it, were you and his answer is, I didn't do it, and when I went to orouba to visit her, I was alone and the cameras did see that. Did anyone tell you to do it, if so, who? His answer is, I don't know anything. Why am I even involved? Ahmed said he had been coerced into a confession, thinking he would get good deal. Ahmed was now fully recanting his initial confession. At this point, we didn't really know what to think. His interview, I still think about that. He had a "Free Syria" bracelet that was taken from the crime scene that still had blood on on his shelf he had a big photo album full of pictures of Halla when she was young. We spoke to confidential sources in the government throughout our investigation who cast a lot of suspicion on the Assad regime in this. But in the end, the FBI provided us a statement that said that the Turkish government had done a thorough investigation, they had elicited a confession from a suspect, and that the FBI had no further information to question the investigation done in Turkey. It's pretty devastating. What does this mean as an American citizen, if I were to travel abroad and something happened to me? Something happened to you? I really hope that our government will take this seriously and realize that there are a lot of people who care about Halla and Dr. Orouba, and they are not forgotten, and we will continue to fight to find justice in their names. I took our findings to congressman David price of north Carolina, who knows the Barakat family, has had his own questions about these murders. You think the trump administration dropped the ball on this? I think this is the administration failing to pursue an important case. The answer is yes. We need to press for an investigation of the trial circumstances. It involves the state department, it involves our diplomacy, and it involves some work with our supposed friends and allies in Turkey. Halla and orouba's case has been in limbo for a number of years. But there is a person at the united nations, Dr. Kalamar, whose specialty is investigating the murders of journalists around the world. What I can tell you is I have received information regarding this case, and in the case of miss and Mrs. Barakat, there are allegations that the work they were doing denouncing the violations by the Syrian government, or indeed by Daesh, may have been the motivation behind their killings. My objective is to determine whether the investigation has met the standards it should meet under international law. Was it effective? Was it impartial? Was it independent? Did it consider all the possible motivations behind the killings? I feel like Halla Barakat is the forgotten American journalist. Experts have said that killing a journalist is the ultimate form of censorship. Maybe by continuing to dig deeper and turn over every rock, somebody will pay attention to what happened to them.

Messi, 33, has spent his entire career with Barcelona after joining their illustrious youth academy all the way back in 1995.


  The six-time Ballon d’Or winner has enjoyed arguably the most successful playing career in history after winning a monumental 36 major trophies including 10 La Liga titles and four Champions League trophies.


  The world-class Argentinian attacker has featured in over 730 matches for Barcelona and has been directly involved in a simply stunning 914 goals in all competitions.


  However, despite a hugely successful career spanning over 25 years with the Catalonian giants, Messi’s future was thrown into doubt earlier this year after suggestions the South American is growing increasingly unhappy at the club which the striker later echoed himself during an interview with Goal.


  Messi’s long-term future appeared to be with former manager Pep Guardiola at Manchester City, however, after Barcelona refused to budge on their leading attacker’s €700m release clause, a summer move unsurprisingly failed to happen, as per Sky Sports.


  Despite Manchester City’s summer disappointment with their failure to capture the sport’s greatest talent, the club’s hierarchy have not been deterred in their ambitions to land the 33-year-old.


  Speaking exclusively to Manchester Evening News, Manchester City’s Chief Operating Officer Omar Berrada said: _“He’s an amazing talent , he’s somebody that can make a significant impact at any club in the world on and off the pitch immediately._


   _“He’s the best player in the world, he’s the best player of his generation._


   _“I think any club in the world would like to explore the possibility of him joining their team. The fact that it was commented that he wanted to come to play for City just shows you how far the team has come over the last years where the best talent of his generation and potentially saying he wants to come and play for us._


   _“It’s hard to guess what could happen. If you think back to those two weeks where everything played out at Barcelona, it’s almost impossible to guess what will happen next summer. Messi is a generational talent, he’s the best player in the world and probably an exception to potential investments that we’d do out of the ordinary but our planning has been done with this current squad and it is being considered with the current opportunities that we have._

The new gen Mahindra crossover will slated to be launched in first half of 2021 When the new Mahindra XUV500's interior was spied up close earlier this year, we were a bit disappointed to see a rather simple instrument cluster and center console. Mahindra is known for making bold statements with its new products and somehow, the mid-premium crossover's interiors didn't fit the bill. As it turns out, what we saw in previous spyshots was an entry level model and the top-end variant is likely to feature Mercedes-style instrument panel and touchscreen infotainment system. Here are the first spy shots, clicked by automotive enthusiast Barani. New Mahindra XUV500 interior A camouflaged prototype of the new Mahindra XUV500 has been recently spotted near Karavalli in Tamil Nadu, and the dashboard features hitherto unseen single-piece wide display which functions as both instrument console and touchscreen infotainment system. This layout, pioneered by Mercedes, is quickly becoming a new norm across the spectrum. Likely to be offered only in higher variants, the 2021 Mahindra XUV500 touchscreen digital instrument panel is expected to be configurable. The infotainment part of it will be offering modern connectivity features. We won't be surprised to see wireless charging and many other funky features. The latest test mule indicates that the new Mahindra XUV500 is gearing up to move a few notches up the market and take the fight to the feature rich MG Hector Plus. Design This prototypes still continue to be equipped with makeshift head and taillights but the sheet metal design seems to be production-ready. Spyshot published some days back, with production spec LED headlight and tail lights, should give you a fair idea about how the new car will look like. Based on an improved platform, the new XUV500 appears to be slightly longer than its predecessor. While the basic shape has evolved slightly, the front and rear fascias have been subjected to significant overhaul. Powertrain lineup The new Mahindra XUV500 is reported to be powered by a 2.0-liter diesel engine producing close to 190 hp and the 2.0-liter turbo-petrol engine that also caters to the new Mahindra Thar (albeit with more power). Both manual and automatic transmissions will be offered and we can expect the higher variants to come with AWD system. Launch Timeline The launch of next generation XUV500 is slated for first half of 2021 but it remains to be seen if there may further delay due to the pandemic. The new SUV will be crucial for Mahindra to regain the lost market share in India's UV segment. In addition to Hector Plus, the car will also be pitted against the soon-to-be-launched Tata Gravitas.

The electricity was out and Palermo said she could see pieces of metal coming off the roof of a 100-year-old building across the street. Unsecured trash cans were flying around the streets.


  “There is a lot of power lines down all over the place, there’s ... really deep water in certain spots,” said hotel guest Johnny Weaver. He had been out in the weather with his friends earlier and one friend’s car was stranded in the water.


  Tropical storm force winds reached 160 miles (260 kilometers) outward from the storm’s center early Saturday. A 68 mph (110 kph) gust was reported at LSU’s Tiger Stadium overnight, and a 55 mph (68 kph) gust was reported at Adams County airport in Natchez, Mississippi.


  In Galveston, Texas, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) from where the center made landfall, winds toppled trees, street signs and two homes under construction, and with dunes flattened by earlier storms, the surge reached beneath raised houses. Large swells and rip currents prompted beach closures as far west as the mouth of the Rio Grande.


  Delta also downed trees across Mississippi, including one that landed on a Jackson-based WLBT-TV vehicle with a news crew inside. No one was injured.


  Forecasters said the storm would move into the Tennessee Valley Saturday and into Sunday as a tropical depression.


  In Delta’s wake, about 740,000 homes and businesses were without power in Louisiana, Texas and Mississippi early Saturday, according to the tracking website PowerOutage.us.


  Delta, the 25th named storm of an unprecedented Atlantic hurricane season, made the record books when it struck the Gulf Coast. It was the first Greek- alphabet-named hurricane to hit the continental U.S. And it became the 10th named storm to hit the mainland U.S. this year, breaking a century-old record set in 1916, according to Colorado State University researcher Phil Klotzbach.


  Delta was the fourth named storm to strike Louisiana in 2020. Tropical Storm Marco fizzled as it hit the southeast Louisiana tip just three days before Laura struck. And Tropical Storm Cristobal caused damage in southeast Louisiana in June.


  Some who rode out Laura hunkered down again with Delta. In Lafayette, about 75 miles (120 kilometers) east of Lake Charles, Jeanne-Marie Gove could hear debris hitting her door as her patio gate banged open and shut. She said the roof from a trailer at the mobile home park behind her apartment was torn off and tossed down the sidewalk.


  “The wind is much worse than what Hurricane Laura brought,” Gove said in a message on Twitter.


  “The wind gusts are making the glass from our windows bow inward,” she added. “It’s pretty scary.”


  Hunter said he thought more people evacuated for Delta than Laura, reducing emergency calls during the worst of the storm. Across the disaster area, people could only wait for the waters to recede before getting a full view of the damage.


  “I believe that Delta could actually be more of a flooding issue than Laura was from what I’m seeing and what I’m hearing right now in the thick of it,” the mayor said Friday night.


  “We really just need people not to forget about us,” Hunter said. “We are going to be in the recovery mode for months and probably years from these two hurricanes. It’s just unprecedented and historic what has happened to us.”

The International Organization for Migration (IOM), which supports many domestic workers in Lebanon, says as many as 10,000 migrants have asked to be repatriated because their wages collapsed after the country plunged into a deep financial crisis a year ago.


  Many employers stopped paying salaries in dollars and some foreign workers said they were leaving with their wages unpaid.


  The numbers of those asking to go home increased further after the huge explosion which struck Beirut in August, the International Labour Organisation said.


  The IOM's Dima Haddad said UN agencies in Lebanon had found "shocking numbers" of vulnerable migrant workers. She said 50% of those they interviewed said they could not pay rent, of which 34% said they were borrowing money to cover basic needs.


  "They treat us like slaves," said a 25-year-old domestic worker heading home after what she said were months of hardship at the hands of her employers that led her in February to jump from the third floor of the house she worked in.


  She survived but, without work and alone on the streets, she faced destitution as the coronavirus pandemic compounded Lebanon's economic problems.


  "After jumping ... I thought I would die but God made it possible for me," she said, recalling how she found help through other migrant workers.


  "I am begging everybody, anyone not to step their feet in this country. It is really not easy," she said from a hotel room in a Beirut suburb where she and other women were preparing to fly home.


  She spoke on condition that she not be identified, and the IOM asked that her nationality not be specified, but most migrant domestic workers in Lebanon come from Africa and Southeast Asia.


  Another worker preparing to be repatriated said she came to Lebanon for secretarial work but found herself working as a maid, moved from one household to another by a local agent.


  When she begged to be sent home she was told to complete her two-year contract first. Under Lebanon's 'kafala' (sponsorship) regulations, which give employers the right to hold the passports of their domestic workers, she was trapped.


  Many of the estimated 250,000 migrant domestic workers in Lebanon are excluded from protection under Lebanon's labour laws, leaving them vulnerable to abuse, rights groups say.


  Human Rights Watch (HRW) describes the kafala system as a restrictive regime which "ties migrant workers’ legal residency to their employer".


  Amendments to the system last month provide guarantees for workers including 48-hour work weeks, a rest day, overtime payment, as well as sick and annual leaves. Workers can now terminate their contracts without their employer's consent.


  HRW welcomed the reforms as a step towards protecting workers’ rights and abolishing the "kafala system" if they were accompanied by a stringent enforcement mechanism. The IOM said it was a positive move.


  "But we must have practical steps to guarantee the execution of this decision so this contract does not remain just ink on paper," Haddad said.

  “Menu development is a heady blend of art and science,” said chef Quinn Adkins, Culver’s menu development director. “You use both in almost equal proportions every single day.”


  Adkins and his team are the “gatekeepers” for the burgers, crinkle cut fries and concrete mixers that appear at Culver’s restaurants from Idaho to Florida (775 locations in 25 states, with another 50 set to open by the end of the year).

  "It's a good time to get things going," he said. "Certainly it's been a long year trying to get everyone on the same page and just on the field. The more time we get to do that, the better off we are.


  "I thought our guys up front set the tone. (Van Buren County) loaded the box the way we expected, but maybe a little different from what we've seen. We were able to make some adjustments."


  The Warriors were dealt a tough blow when Mertens was injured on the Panthers' first series of the game and didn't return. His explosiveness was missing, and the offense struggled to move the ball except for a couple series late in the game.


  Davis tacked on a pair of short scoring runs for the Warriors.


  Though the Panthers have been up and down all season, Blakely feels like the team is making progress when it needs to be. Some of the losses have been ugly, but the wins have been complete efforts.

ALLEN, DOUGLAS KENNETH LAIRD June 24, 1930 - October 2, 2020 It is with heavy hearts that the family of Doug Allen announces his death on October 2, 2020. Doug was the beloved partner of Ruth MacLean. He was predeceased by his wife, Frances and son, Sean. He leaves his daughter, Kelli, grandchildren Kristen, Ashley, Jessica, and Cassidy, daughter-in-law, Sue Allen and Scott, Bruce and Heather MacLean. In 1952, Doug graduated from University of Toronto School of Architecture, Landscape and Design. In 1963, he established the practice of Allen and Sherriff Architects Inc. which continues to this day. Doug's athletic endeavours were many. He travelled the world and paddled some of the world's greatest rivers.

If there's a rival for the most affecting song on the record, it's "St. Augustine at Night," a whisper-quiet song in which Goldsmith is accompanied only by finger-picked acoustic guitar and occasional hushed piano chords. In images and themes straight out of an Andre Dubus short story, Goldsmith gives a first-person account of a working-class man and his family in northern Florida from childhood to middle age. Characters live and die, shirk responsibilities, flounder, grow apart, make mistakes, harbor regrets, and refuse to talk about them because they're "not sure what good it would do." They also wonder about what role God may or may not play in their lives and their failures, and express a wish that "he'd just point the way to go" and "just start speaking up."

The electricity was out and Palermo said she could see pieces of metal coming off the roof of a 100-year-old building across the street. Unsecured trash cans were flying around the streets.
 “There is a lot of power lines down all over the place, there’s ... really deep water in certain spots,” said hotel guest Johnny Weaver. He had been out in the weather with his friends earlier and one friend’s car was stranded in the water.
 Tropical storm force winds reached 160 miles (260 kilometers) outward from the storm’s center early Saturday. A 68 mph (110 kph) gust was reported at LSU’s Tiger Stadium overnight, and a 55 mph (68 kph) gust was reported at Adams County airport in Natchez, Mississippi.
 In Galveston, Texas, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) from where the center made landfall, winds toppled trees, street signs and two homes under construction, and with dunes flattened by earlier storms, the surge reached beneath raised houses. Large swells and rip currents prompted beach closures as far west as the mouth of the Rio Grande.
 Delta also downed trees across Mississippi, including one that landed on a Jackson-based WLBT-TV vehicle with a news crew inside. No one was injured.
 Forecasters said the storm would move into the Tennessee Valley Saturday and into Sunday as a tropical depression.
 In Delta’s wake, about 740,000 homes and businesses were without power in Louisiana, Texas and Mississippi early Saturday, according to the tracking website PowerOutage.us.
 Delta, the 25th named storm of an unprecedented Atlantic hurricane season, made the record books when it struck the Gulf Coast. It was the first Greek- alphabet-named hurricane to hit the continental U.S. And it became the 10th named storm to hit the mainland U.S. this year, breaking a century-old record set in 1916, according to Colorado State University researcher Phil Klotzbach.
 Delta was the fourth named storm to strike Louisiana in 2020. Tropical Storm Marco fizzled as it hit the southeast Louisiana tip just three days before Laura struck. And Tropical Storm Cristobal caused damage in southeast Louisiana in June.
 Some who rode out Laura hunkered down again with Delta. In Lafayette, about 75 miles (120 kilometers) east of Lake Charles, Jeanne-Marie Gove could hear debris hitting her door as her patio gate banged open and shut. She said the roof from a trailer at the mobile home park behind her apartment was torn off and tossed down the sidewalk.
 “The wind is much worse than what Hurricane Laura brought,” Gove said in a message on Twitter.
 “The wind gusts are making the glass from our windows bow inward,” she added. “It’s pretty scary.”
 Hunter said he thought more people evacuated for Delta than Laura, reducing emergency calls during the worst of the storm. Across the disaster area, people could only wait for the waters to recede before getting a full view of the damage.
 “I believe that Delta could actually be more of a flooding issue than Laura was from what I’m seeing and what I’m hearing right now in the thick of it,” the mayor said Friday night.
 “We really just need people not to forget about us,” Hunter said. “We are going to be in the recovery mode for months and probably years from these two hurricanes. It’s just unprecedented and historic what has happened to us.”

Today we take for granted the abundance of fresh, clean water for household use. But such has not been the case all along.


  The northwest part of Hunt County was notorious for lacking underground water. Therefore, farmers relied on surface water, from creeks, rain, and rivers for agricultural and household use.


  That involved digging pools to collect water for livestock and build cisterns for domestic use. Usually large structures, cisterns were bell shaped, sometime sunk 20 or more feet into the ground with sides covered with brick; sand or gravel lined the bottom of the cistern. The cistern, which collected rainwater from the roof, had an opening about three or four feet wide that enabled a bucket to be lowered for water.

The red planet is big and bright and casting its glow all night long this week. It is just in time for the fall foliage season most of us in the United States and elsewhere in the north are experiencing.      But what would you call the color of Mars?      It's not really "red," but it certainly reflects sunlight in the red end of the spectrum. This may depend somewhat on your eyes and sky conditions, but, to me, it appears more of a golden red-orange to the naked eye.      Mars is currently in one of its closer approaches to the Earth, which you should appreciate while you can. Mars circles the sun about every two Earth years but varies considerably with how near it approaches.      Mars was at its closest point to the Earth on Oct. 6, and will be at opposition with the sun on Oct. 13. That means Mars is directly opposite from the sun in the sky, rising as the sun sets and setting when the sun rises.      In even a small telescope magnifying about 50x to 100x, you can detect Mars as a disc, although it is quite tiny. Still, it is an amazing sight in the eyepiece even if it is so small. You can see the small disc of Mars, likely with faint stars in the background (unless you have a lot of light pollution). Imagine you are in a spacecraft nearing Mars.      If your telescope can handle higher magnifications, and the seeing is good (steady air), you should be able to glimpse dark smudges on the disc and a very small and very white south polar cap.      The "smudges" are referred to as maria, and are fairly permanent markings that you may have seen in photographs. The maria are named and charted on Mars maps. You can even purchase Mars globes, which make for an interesting conversation piece.      The dark features are areas of higher contrast, caused by either darker, basaltic rock or simply where less Martian dust has settled.      The color of Mars in the telescope is striking. The vast Martian deserts are not quite red, perhaps red-orange. To me, it is close to the shade of a peach, more so than a cherry or red apple. Either way, Mars is amazing.      The color is caused by iron oxide chemicals in the dusty soil which resembles rust.      Along with Mars, the colors of autumn can be found in several bright stars visible to the unaided eye and thousands more you can see with a small telescope and a good star map to lead the way.      Perception of color among the stars by our eyes is limited to brighter stars simply because of the way our eyes are structured, at night or in dim light our eyes are less sensitive to color.      The telescope amplifies the brightness, so many more stars are visible that become bright enough to show their shade.      Among red stars, there are red supergiants and red dwarfs. The dwarf stars are very abundant, and none bright enough to see without a telescope.      A couple of wonderful, bright red stars are Antares, well seen on a summer evening, and Betelgeuse, which is most well known as part of Orion, prominent on winter evenings.      Then there is bright yellow-orange Arcturus and bright yellow Capella. You can see these two on opposite sides of the sky as darkness falls in October. Arcturus is in the west, and Capella low in the northwest.      Many more stars are white, or bluish-white.      Early on an October evening, the brilliant star Vega shines with a blue-white light high up in the west; you can also see the bright white stars Deneb and Altair in the west-southwest, and bright white Fomalhaut low in the southeast.      Of course with Mars, we have the planets Jupiter - very bright - and Saturn, a little less bright and to the left, down in the southern sky.      The other morning, I ventured forth onto the deck at around 6 a.m. just in time to make some cats scatter. Looking up, I was delighted to see the very brilliant planet Venus, high in the east, and Mars, which by this time was low in the west. In the southern sky, I had a foretaste of winter but without's winter's cold: there was the wonderful constellation Orion, with the bright red star Betelgeuse, white star Rigel and, to the lower-left the brightest star of the night sky, blue-white Sirius.      The waning gibbous moon was nearly overhead.      Enjoy the colors of the night.      The moon is now a waning crescent, visible in the east after midnight. New moon is on Oct. 16.

The Citroen mini UV for India is expected to be ready for next year's festive season We came across the first example of these prototypes testing on a public a few months ago and we mistakenly identified it as the Nissan Magnite. Interestingly, the Citroen prototypes sport an identical camouflage design compared to its Nissan rival and this led to our confusion. Anyways, the Citroen mini UV for India seems closer to production than we originally anticipated. Some of these prototypes are being tested by ARAI, indicating that the homologation process is well underway. Citroen mini UV for India The Citroen mini UV for India will be an important volume generator for the new coming which will soon start its top-down approach with the launch of C5 Aircross SUV. The latest spyshots indicate that the sub-4m Citroen C21 (codename) crossover prototype is sporting production-spec body panels. While the finer design details are still under wraps, it can be observed that the compact crossover follows the French brand's unique design language. The styling appears to be inspired by the slightly larger Europe-spec C3 Aircross SUV. Two-part headlamps, narrow grille, rectangular secondary air-dam, undramatic sheet metal design and a minimal rear fascia appear to be the salient design trains of the new Citroen mini UV. We expect the crossover's interior to borrow a lot of elements from the C3 Aircross. Going by the segment standards and Citroen's desire for a premium positioning in India, we can expect the C21 to be equipped with a comprehensive touchscreen infotainment system, state-of-the-art connectivity features, automatic climate control and so on. Specifications The Citroen mini SUV for India will be underpinned by PSA Peugeot Citroen Group's new Common Modular Platform (CMP) which will cater to emerging markets like India and South America. This architecture will be heavily localized in India in order to arrive at a competitive price point. The Maruti Brezza rival is reported to be powered by a 1.2-liter turbocharged petrol engine which produces 110 hp on board the Berlingo van which was also spotted testing in India. We expect the crossover to be available with both manual and automatic transmission options. Rivals The Citroen mini SUV will be locking horns with the ever-growing list of sub-4m crossovers in the country including Maruti Vitara Brezza, Hyundai Venue, Tata Nexon, Mahindra XUV300, Kia Sonet, Ford EcoSport, and the upcoming Nissan Magnite and Renault Kiger. The French crossover will be built at the Thiruvallur manufacturing facility owned by CK Birla.

Vor einem Rückfall in die Steinzeit muss sich Red-Bull-Pilot Max Verstappen nicht fürchten.
