Last fall, Félix Tshisekedi, the president of Democratic Republic of Congo, made a triumphant prediction: Before 2019 was over, the Ebola outbreak that had ravaged his country for over a year would finally be brought to a close. Already, health workers had managed to quash the Ebola virus in all but a small set of remaining hot zones. New infections had slowed to a trickle.
 Then, on Nov. 28, unidentified armed men launched a series of attacks on the offices and living quarters of several Ebola response teams, killing three workers and forcing scores of others to evacuate the area. Within days, new Ebola infections were once again on the rise.
 It was just the latest setback in an outbreak that has proved devilishly difficult to contain as it's unfolded in a part of Congo with a long history of conflict between the government and multiple armed groups. Since the epidemic was declared on Aug. 1, 2018, more than 3,300 people have been infected with Ebola, making the outbreak the worst on record for Congo, and the second worst in human history after the much larger West Africa Ebola outbreak of 2013-2016.

India are faced with a tricky decision ahead of the third and final Twnety20 International against Sri Lanka at the Maharashtra Cricket Association (MCA) Stadium in Pune. Will captain Virat Kohli and the think tank want to test their bench strength – the likes of Manish Pandey and Sanju Samson, who have been trying hard to break into the batting order?
 The three-match series was reduced to a two-match affair after the series opener in Guwahati was washed out without a ball being bowled. The hosts dished out a clinical performance and defeated Sri Lanka by seven wickets at Indore.
 With a series win at stake, the focus will be on India’s think tank. Will they want to go ahead with the same winning combination in a bid to clinch the series or will they try out different combinations and think of the bigger picture which is the 2020 ICC T20 World Cup in Australia this year.

Amigo do major Vasco Brazão, o major Pinto da Costa é referido pelo Ministério Publico ao longo da acusação por ter sido um dos que recebeu a informação -- vinda de um inspetor de Vila Real -- de que o estava previsto haver um assalto a uma instalação militar do país. Já após o furto ao paiol de Tancos, Pinto da Costa terá ligado a ocorrência à informação e terá pedido mais dados sobre quem a tinha veiculado a um militar do Algarve: tratava-se de Fechaduras, que tinha sido convidado a participar no assalto, mas que teria depois se arrependera e permanecia a viver no sul do país.
 Com a investigação ao furto de Tancos nas mãos da PJ civil e a causar revolta ao diretor da PJM, Luís Vieira (também arguido), os elementos da PJM partiram então, com aquela informação, para uma investigação paralela que acabaria por contar com a colaboração de militares da GNR de Loulé. Um deles acabaria por chegar à fala com João Paulino, aquele que é tido como o cérebro do assalto a Tancos, -- e com quem a PJM terá negociado a enterga de armas, dando-lhe como moeda de troca não ser penalizado pelo crime que cometera.
 O Ministério Público acredita que tudo isto se passou à revelia da Polícia Judiciária civil, quando estas polícias não tinham competência delegada pelo Ministério Publico para esta investigação e deviam ter comunicado tudo o que sabiam à PJ. O Ministério Público acredita também que o então ministro da Defesa, Azeredo Lopes, sabia de tudo desde do início, a avaliar pelas visitas que recebia de Luís Vieira em sua casa, os telefonemas e outros encontros.

As I explained in my book on rural schools, in many rural communities, schools are the largest employer. They provide political power, and they tie people together. Once the schools are gone, the community loses all of these benefits: There are smaller crowds at the diner and fewer seats on the school board. Property values may also decline.

DOUGLAS, Ga. (AP) — A Georgia man has been released from prison after spending more than a third of his life incarcerated for a crime he didn't commit. Kerry Robinson, 44, walked out of a South Georgia prison Wednesday after 17 years behind bars and hugged his relatives, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. He was convicted of breaking into a woman’s home in 1993 and sexually assaulting her, according to his attorneys at the Atlanta-based Georgia Innocence Project. Robinson filed a motion for a new trial in September 2019 and was exonerated by Southern Judicial Circuit District Attorney Brad Shealy. DNA evidence retested using modern technology proved the original state Bureau of Investigation analysis that was presented at trial was misleading. A GBI analyst suggested during the 2002 trial that a mixture of DNA in the victim's rape kit likely matched Robinson, though tests weren't conclusive. But Robinson and supporters maintained his innocence. Robinson was never identified as a suspect by the victim, and he argues a co- defendant in the case falsely implicated him to authorities because he had reported the man to police in another case. Robinson’s son, sister and other relatives were there waiting as he was freed from Coffee Correctional Facility outside of Douglas.

Pellegrini 'not surprised' by City goals                                                          The only black mark on City's night was that Jovetic had replaced Aguero, who sustained a hamstring injury just before half-time and is now a doubt for Monday's crucial meeting with Chelsea at the Etihad.                                                          That injury apart, this was a highly satisfactory night for Pellegrini with City's display confirming they are now the team to catch, not only at the Premier League summit but in terms of quality and performance.                                                          They knew the prize on offer for a victory and produced a masterclass in the opening half-hour which could easily have seen the game won - with Aguero as the spearhead.                                                          He set the tone inside four minutes when he showed pace and power to create space before striking the far post with Spurs keeper Hugo Lloris beaten, while Dzeko deceived Kyle Walker in the area but shot wastefully over the top.                                                          The goal was coming and it duly arrived after 15 minutes, Aguero making it look deceptively easy as he converted David Silva's pass with an angled finish.                                                          Aguero was proving impossible for Spurs to control and the Argentine's fine header from Gael Clichy's cross required a diving one-handed stop from Lloris to prevent City extending their lead.                                                          He was the threat again when first his header from Silva's corner was cleared off the line by Rose, before the striker reacted first but sent a shot inches off target.

It must be noted that many leaders of Jammu and Kashmir including PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti, National Conference's Farooq Abdullah and Omar Abdullah, along with several activists were detained on the eve of August 5 when the Centre revoked Article 370, dissolving the former state's special status, and bifurcating it into two distinct Union Territories. The leaders continue to be detained till date, while internet services are still suspended in the Valley.
 Besides, 15 diplomats from across the globe - including the US, Latin America, South Korea, and others - are on a two-day tour in the Valley to take stock of the security situation and government's efforts in the region. However, delegates from the European Union stalled their visit to Jammu and Kashmir last evening stating that they did not want a ‘guided tour’ of the Union Territory.

Google's new Watchlist feature is still in its infancy. For the time being, it's only available on mobile devices and there's no dedicated app. If you want to see what's on your Watchlist, you can access it by searching "my watchlist" on your device or on the Collections tab in the Google app. If it picks up steam -- and I hope that it will -- I can definitely see Google adding features like Google Assistant integration with optional new episode notifications and more. Even in its current state though, it's already a useful tool for anyone who has cut the cord or who wants to keep track of all the movies, TV shows, and streaming shows he or she watches in a single spot.

From today, he will have fantastic future at this club.                                                                          "The big problem was that he came to a new club and it was not easy to immediately find a good relationship with the new team-mates and our play.

Torres and Drogba have so far failed to strike up an understanding when they have played together but Ancelotti hinted he might field both against Spurs next Saturday.

Ancelotti admitted that United remain in the driving seat for a 19th top-flight title but insisted that his team, who won the Double last season, would fight until the end to retain their crown.                                                                          "I don't think Manchester United have more pressure now, they are six points ahead and that is a good gap with just four games left," the Chelsea manager added.

The scoreline was harsh on bottom-of-the table West Ham, who are now two points adrift of safety, and manager Avram Grant reflected: "I think everybody in this room knows that we deserved better.                                                                          "[Chelsea keeper] Petr Cech was excellent today with two or three great saves. If someone didn't see the game, they think 3-0, Chelsea is much better than us.                                                                          "I can be very proud of the players.

Shortly after the NPF season was over, a team full of former Aussie Peppers ran the table to win the Asia/Oceania Olympic qualifier in Shanghai, China, in September.
 Now, with the Olympics just around the corner in August, Team Australia needed somewhere to prepare for the Tokyo games during the early summer months.
 Re-enter Mankato and National Pro Fastpitch. The Aussie Peppers are coming back to town.
 “We had a good relationship, and the partnership was great,” Peppers general manager Matt Mangulis said. “It seemed like an easy decision after last year.”
 There were still questions about Team Australia’s future in Mankato as recently as October, but those are obviously gone with Tuesday’s announcement.
 Despite feeling at home in Mankato last season, playing across the world in the months ahead of the games still isn’t completely ideal for Team Australia. However, the elite competition in NPF seemed to be the determining factor. Of the six teams competing in Tokyo, three of them will be in NPF, with Mexico and Canada also set to be in the league.
 That means we’re going to have Olympic previews regularly played at Caswell Park this summer.

A man has been arrested in connection with the murder of a Northern Cape police officer whose body was found in Lennertsville, Keimoes, on Wednesday morning.
 Constable Stephano Nico Visagie, 28, was visiting a friend and had apparently decided to spend the night, police spokesperson Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo said.
 He was found on the bed with a stab wound to the chest at around 05:40 on Wednesday.
 Naidoo said investigators worked around the clock on the case, resulting in the arrest of the 35-year-old suspect in Krugersdorp. The suspect is expected to appear in the Keimoes Magistrate's Court on Monday and faces a charge of murder.
 The murder of the constable caused a stir among residents of Keimoes and Upington who then took to the streets protesting and calling for the killer to be arrested.
 Police have urged the community to be calm and allow the investigation to get underway.
 "People are also cautioned that no form of violence will be tolerated. Thus far, at least 23 people have been arrested. Eight who are minors have been released while the other 15 are appearing in the Keimoes court today on a charge of public violence," said Naidoo.
 National Police Commissioner General Khehla John Sitole has applauded the cops working on the case for the swift arrest.
