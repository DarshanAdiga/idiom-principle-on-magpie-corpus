 Dear Dave,
 I've been trying to get my sister and her husband on your plan, but they're hesitant to try living on a budget. They make good money, and both of them think doing a budget every month would be too difficult and take too much time. Do you have any suggestions I could pass along that might make them realize that making a budget isn't so hard or time-consuming?
  _Kelsey_
 Dear Kelsey,
 Believe me, I hear those excuses all the time. In most cases, the people who say these kinds of things don't really understand what a budget is or how to efficiently put one together. If you've followed my advice, you learned first- hand that budgeting isn't scary once you get the hang of it. Household budgets don't need to be about hours of tedious math and complicated formulas. Like most things in life, simple is usually best.
 A good way to simplify budgeting, especially for couples, is by making it a team effort. It's important to make sure your spouse is on board, and knows what's up with the budget, because you're just asking for problems when one spouse is doing all the planning and the other is doing all the spending.
 Sit down together for a few minutes, once a month, and have a budget meeting where you look at your income, your outgo, and you both give every dollar a name and a job to do. It's really that simple. Share your ideas, your hopes, and your dreams for the future, as well as the fears you have. The important thing is that you're both in agreement and working together. That alone will make your lives, your budget, and your money easier to handle.
 Also, make sure you have cut up all your credit cards and closed the accounts. No more credit cards means fewer bills to add to the budget, fewer complications, and zero worries about fees and interest rates. Stick to using a debit card and cash. After all, they're both part of the plan!
 Making a schedule for budget meetings and bill payments is a good idea, too. You can even make your budget meetings a fun time by including your favorite snacks. Set up auto drafts out of your checking account to pay bills and buy your groceries on a set day every week or twice a month. When you know what to expect and when, it takes a lot of stress and potential pitfalls out of the budgeting picture.
 There's always some work and discipline that goes along with gaining control of your money. But a budget doesn't need to be torture. A little planning, communication and some basic math will go a long way - and it won't be nearly as time-consuming, or as difficult, as you think!

Some background: I don't shave my face a lot, especially during the pandemic, but I wear my hair short (kind of a soft buzz) and am diligent about hygiene. I've reviewed products from Manscaped, including the company's Lawn Mower, a body hair trimmer specifically marketed for keeping your business below the belt, um, best in show. It’s garnered some attention from "Shark Tank" and ads on Instagram. I liked that trimmer but ultimately decided that I personally don't really need it.

The Radeon Pro V7350X2 might date back to the Polaris days, but the dual-GPU could probably hold its own against today's more modern offerings. Actually, the Radeon Pro V7350X2's performance isn't too bad. Out of the 11 available results from the GFXBench 5.0 onscreen tests, the Radeon Pro V7350X2 outpaced the Navi-powered Radeon Pro W5500 in four of them, so it wasn't a completely one-sided victory.
 Certainly, the Radeon Pro V7350X2 looks outdated beside the Radeon Pro W5500 considering that the dual-GPU has more than three times the number of SPs and up to four times the memory. Not to mention that the Radeon Pro V7350X2 seemingly has a 200W TDP (thermal design power), while the Radeon Pro W5500 only carries a 125W rating.
 However, we have to bear in mind that AMD's Ellesmere is based on the old- school Polaris graphics architecture. Obviously, its performance and power efficiency are nowhere near what Navi offers. If it did, AMD wouldn't be where it is right now in the graphics game.
 Radeon Pro V7350X2 isn't something that anyone would pick up in this day and age, and it's not like the graphics card is widely available anyways. It was still interesting to see what kind of performance the Radeon Pro V7350X2 would have brought to the table if AMD didn't get cold feet.

Dei 18 positivi tre, tutti residenti a Crotone, sono ricoverati al Pugliese Ciaccio. Nel bollettino regionale diffuso oggi i casi positivi della provincia di Crotone risultano nove e non otto. L’Asp pitagorica chiarisce che «il nono positivo si riferisce ad un caso già noto, risottoposto a tampone di controllo». Uno dei tre casi di cui si sta tentando di ricostruire i movimenti «di recente ha avuto accesso in un reparto del locale presidio ospedaliero». Il reparto del “San Giovanni di Dio” è stato temporaneamente chiuso e sono stati effettuati tamponi «a tutti i contatti, anche non stretti, compreso il personale dipendente». Si è, quindi, proceduto alla sanificazione degli ambienti e domani il reparto dovrebbe riprendere le attività. Tre dei casi di oggi sono singoli soggetti residenti nei comuni di Isola Capo Rizzuto, Melissa e Crotone. A Isola Capo Rizzuto i casi diventano due.

The teach-in is the latest development in FRU’s campaign, whose petition has garnered over 2,500 signatures urging Warren County’s Board of Supervisors to remove and relocate Front Royal’s Confederate monument. After being overwhelmed by concerned citizens at recent meetings, in August the Board refused to continue hearing FRU’s request on its agenda—and instead put it up for referendum, while pledging to host a public forum for debate. With no signs of such an event on the horizon and voting now in full swing, FRU scheduled its own educational panel for the public to learn about the parallels between Confederate memorials and the institution of slavery. At the October 6 Board meeting, member Laura Lee Cascada urged the Supervisors to attend, stating, “Today we need to take action and not wait around for the majority to come around on issues of justice. If we did that, women would not have the right to vote; slaves would still be enslaved.”
