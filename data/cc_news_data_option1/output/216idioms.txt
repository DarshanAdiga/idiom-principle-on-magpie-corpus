La France a fait des "propositions" aux Etats-Unis, dont le principe d'une progression "par étape", pour les rallier à l'accord international en cours de négociations à l'OCDE sur la taxation du numérique, a annoncé vendredi le ministre français de l'Economie Bruno Le Maire.
 "Il y a des possibilités qui peuvent être utilisées, nous y travaillons avec (le secrétaire américain au Trésor) Steven Mnuchin. Je lui ai fait un certain nombre de propositions", a affirmé le ministre français lors d'un point presse à l'issue d'une rencontre avec le secrétaire général de l'OCDE Angel Gurria.
 Il n'a pas voulu détailler le contenu de ces propositions, ni préciser si la France ferait un geste sur la taxe mise en place l'an dernier sur les géants du numérique et qui a poussé Washington à menacer de surtaxer plusieurs milliards de dollars de produits français.
 "Nous allons les garder pour nous en ce moment, mais je pense qu'il y a un chemin possible de compromis entre les Etats-Unis et la France sur ce sujet, qui permettra a chacun d'avancer vers cette solution qui est la seule raisonnable: une solution internationale à l'OCDE", a-t-il indiqué.
 Le 7 janvier, les Etats-Unis et la France s'étaient donné quinze jours pour aboutir à un accord et permettre ainsi la poursuite du travail à l'OCDE sur l'instauration d'une taxation internationale des géants du numérique.
 Bruno Le Maire doit rencontrer mercredi à Davos Steven Mnuchin avec l'espoir d'annoncer un tel accord. Une réunion à laquelle participera M. Gurria.
 Lors d'un point presse conjoint, MM. Le Maire et Gurria ont indiqué être ouverts à une progression "par étape", avec un premier pas qui serait "un accord global sur le cadre de cette taxation" sur la base du texte négocié à l'OCDE.
 Si les Américains donnent leur feu vert, cet accord doit en principe être approuvé fin janvier par les membres de l'organisation internationale.
 La discussion se poursuivrait ensuite jusqu'en juin sur les "paramètres de cette taxation", avant "une mise en œuvre qui pourrait avoir lieu un peu plus tard", a détaillé M. Le Maire.
 "Ca peut être un des points de sortie envisageable", a-t-il ajouté, insistant sur le fait que la taxe française restera en place jusqu'à l'entrée en vigueur d'une taxation internationale.
 M. Gurria a salué de son côté "l'opportunité ouverte" par la réunion prévue à Davos, rappelant que l'OCDE "n'envisage pas de plan B", au projet de taxation du numérique actuellement sur la table.

Meanwhile Paul Dendle (Con, Arundel and Walberton) added: “I do not think there is an overall desire to keep the cabinet system but there is a desire to do the right thing and make the right decision and an informed decision.”
 Shaun Gunner (Con Rustington East) echoed this and felt there was a misunderstanding that the Tories were unhappy with the outcome of the governance review when they were only taking issue with the process.
 Then Ricky Bower (Con, East Preston) suggested some people thought the council’s culture was ‘wrong rather than the organisation’.
 Cllr Oppler questioned whether the Tories truly had an open mind on the proposed changes and felt were merely ‘trying to kick this into the long grass so change never happens at all’.

But much to the chagrin of fantasy football diehards, statistics only tell part of the story, and the reality is Mahomes is a much better quarterback than he was as a first-time starter. The experience he gained while leading the Chiefs to the AFC title game last season was invaluable. His footwork and mechanics are further refined. The photographic memory that allows Mahomes to dissect defenses in the blink of an eye has been honed by hundreds of hours of film study.

Prosecutors oppose moving the trial, pointing to the plethora of potential jurors still in the running — all pledged they could be fair and impartial — as evidence that the process is working. Moving to a smaller community with a smaller jury pool would only make it more difficult to find jurors, they added.
