In light of that, Lewis is to be forgiven for accusing Trump of “an unhealthy disregard for the Constitution”; the propagandizing young turncoat may not be aware of the Tenth Amendment, which states: “The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.” After decades of federal overreach by numerous Presidents of both parties, Trump has scrupulously respected that stipulation, in his handling both of the coronavirus and the Leftist riots. Numerous Democratic mayors and governors have singularly failed to deal adequately with either crisis, but the responsibility to deal with them was nevertheless theirs, and Trump has respected that.

It normally takes years to create a new vaccine from scratch, but scientists are setting speed records this time around, spurred by knowledge that vaccination is the world's best hope against the pandemic. The coronavirus wasn't even known to exist before late December, and vaccine makers sprang into action Jan. 10 when China shared the virus' genetic sequence.
 Just 65 days later in March, the NIH-made vaccine was tested in people. The first recipient is encouraging others to volunteer now.
 “We all feel so helpless right now. There’s very little that we can do to combat this virus. And being able to participate in this trial has given me a sense of, that I’m doing something,” Jennifer Haller of Seattle told the AP. “Be prepared for a lot of questions from your friends and family about how it’s going, and a lot of thank-you’s."
 That first-stage study that included Haller and 44 others showed the shots revved up volunteers’ immune systems in ways scientists expect will be protective, with some minor side effects such as a brief fever, chills and pain at the injection site. Early testing of other leading candidates have had similarly encouraging results.
 If everything goes right with the final studies, it still will take months for the first data to trickle in from the Moderna test, followed by the Oxford one.
 Governments around the world are trying to stockpile millions of doses of those leading candidates so if and when regulators approve one or more vaccines, immunizations can begin immediately. But the first available doses will be rationed, presumably reserved for people at highest risk from the virus.
 “We’re optimistic, cautiously optimistic” that the vaccine will work and that “toward the end of the year” there will be data to prove it, Dr. Stephen Hoge, president of Massachusetts-based Moderna, told a House subcommittee last week.
 Until then, Haller, the volunteer vaccinated back in March, wears a mask in public and takes the same distancing precautions advised for everyone -- while hoping that one of the shots in the pipeline pans out.
 “I don’t know what the chances are that this is the exact right vaccine. But thank goodness that there are so many others out there battling this right now,” she said.

"articleBody": "
 This summer marks the first time in my life that I've been reluctant to tell people what I do for a living. If it comes up in conversation, I try to find a way to change the subject.
 I'm a farmer. I grow broccoli with my son in Lynden, Ont., outside of Hamilton, just like I used to do with my father.
 To be clear, I'm not ashamed of my livelihood. I love my work. I'm deeply proud of the role I play in society, putting fresh, local food on the tables of Canadians. Farming isn't just a job. It's a way of life. It's all encompassing. You live where you work and you work whenever the weather allows. You don't punch out at the end of the day.
 But there's a stigma now to the job my family has performed for generations that didn't exist before the COVID-19 pandemic. A damning and inaccurate narrative has taken shape, one that suggests farmers deserve the blame for seasonal workers from overseas who have contracted the virus.
 Some communities have turned against farmers and maintained it's their fault they haven't emerged more quickly from lockdown restrictions. Activists have called for an end to a seasonal labour program that has helped farmers deal with a chronic shortage of domestic labour for more than 50 years. Even more hurtful are the accusations that farmers are deliberately mistreating the men and women who work on their farms or not doing enough to protect them.
 In the midst of an already difficult season -- navigating a combined health and economic crisis -- farmers have never felt more misunderstood, misrepresented and demoralized. I know of growers who have already decided to get out of agriculture altogether or are looking at selling their family farms because they're tired of having their characters attacked.
 It's terrible that any of Ontario's seasonal farm workers became ill with COVID-19, let alone that there were several large-scale outbreaks. It goes to show how aggressive this virus can be in any work environment where physical distancing is a challenge.
 But counter to the inaccuracies being spread in some circles, farmers _do_ care about the health and well-being of the people who work for them -- international employees and domestic workers alike. They care about them as workers and, more importantly, they care about them as people.
 Why would any farmer in their right mind not want to make certain that the people they depend on for a successful growing season are healthy and able to work?
 I've had a unique perspective on the benefits of seasonal labour on Canadian farms. In addition to my job as a broccoli grower, for the past 15 years I have also been president of Foreign Agricultural Resource Management Services (FARMS), the non-profit organization that administers the Seasonal Agricultural Worker Program (SAWP) in Ontario and Atlantic Canada. I've served on the board of FARMS for 28 years and my family has employed workers through SAWP for 50 years.
 Men and women from Mexico and the Caribbean have been helping Ontario farmers solve a critical shortage of agricultural workers through SAWP for more than half a century. At the same time, they've helped lift themselves and their families out of a punishing cycle of poverty in their home countries.
 SAWP has been successful for more than 50 years because it provides benefits to everyone who participates in it -- from the growers who need supplemental seasonal labour, to Ontarians who are able to buy top-quality local foods at the grocery store, to the workers themselves who are able to provide better living conditions for their families back home.
 While COVID-19 has presented significant challenges, growers have been able to protect the vast majority of their workers from contracting the virus through rigorous safety protocols.
 In addition to meeting minimum safety requirements, many farmers have invested in more stringent measures to enhance physical distancing, such as carrying out renovations in worker accommodations to create more separation, installing Plexiglas divisions and barriers in packing houses, and organizing regular grocery deliveries for workers to limit travel.
 If someone isn't following the rules properly, FARMS wants to know about it, and we take action to ensure they are in compliance. We have zero tolerance in our program for farm operators who aren't willing or able to meet their responsibilities.
 Contrary to misinformation and inaccurate generalizations about SAWP, international workers hired through the program are well taken care of if they become ill. They receive the same employment rights as Canadians such as WSIB, certain Employment Insurance benefits, occupational health and safety and provincial health care during their term of employment.
 Because I've seen how much good this labour program can do for so many, it's hard to hear people who don't know better or who have ulterior motives disparaging it and the farming community.
 We should be celebrating the success of a program that generates benefits for so many -- the workers and their families, consumers, farmers, rural communities and our economy as a whole -- not trying to dismantle it.
 The truth is, our food security depends on it.

Roughly three months before Election Day, a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds that Biden's supporters are less enthusiastic than Trump's — both about the campaign itself and about their candidate — although the Democrat's coalition may be equally motivated by anxiety.
 Still, the poll reveals an American public at odds with Trump on wearing masks, on balancing restrictions to stop the virus with efforts to help the economy and on fully reopening schools. And voters give Biden higher marks on many positive traits that apply to leadership in the age of the coronavirus, including honesty, capability and caring for Americans.
 Sherek's assessment of the candidates highlights the nuanced motivations underlying the so-called enthusiasm gap, which has raised concerns among Biden's allies who worry the deficit could undermine his candidacy once voting begins.
 While interest in the presidential campaign is high across the board, just 31% of Biden supporters say they're excited, compared with 42% of Trump supporters. Biden's coalition is fueled by more negative emotions: 72% of Biden supporters, but 52% of Trump supporters, say they feel anxious about the 2020 campaign. The same disparity exists for frustration with the election, 65% for Biden supporters and 45% for Trump's.
 Anya Kumar, an 18-year-old recent high school graduate from Columbia, Missouri, vowed to vote for Biden this fall but conceded many of her young friends who oppose Trump don't feel much passion for the former vice president. Many aren't even registered, she said.
 “For the most part, people I know really just don’t want Trump,” Kumar said, acknowledging that she is motivated more by anxiety about Trump's reelection than genuine excitement about his Democratic rival. “If Biden doesn't win, that would suck.”
 Biden's team largely dismisses the idea of an enthusiasm gap. It says that with Trump's level of support shrinking, a greater share of energized supporters is left behind in the diminished pool. Indeed, Trump's job approval in the new poll sits at 38%, within the narrow range that has endured throughout his presidency but down from relative highs earlier this year.
 Just 32% of voters approve of the way Trump is handling the pandemic, a low point that follows a steady decline from the outset of the crisis. While Trump's supporters almost unanimously approve of his performance overall, 2 in 10 disapprove of his response to the pandemic.
 Stacey Rogus, 43, a Republican from Glendale, Arizona, who works in the medical industry, admitted some concerns about Trump. She says the president is narcissistic, doesn't act as “presidential” as she'd like and doesn't think before he speaks. But Rogus is determined to vote for him a second time because of his economic policies and support for the U.S.-Mexico border wall.
 She also suspects that Trump's political opponents are exaggerating the threat of the coronavirus pandemic to hurt his reelection. She finds the timing of the outbreak “a little odd.”
 “He didn’t make the virus,” Rogus said. “If anything, maybe the Democrat party created it just to make him look bad.” (The Office of the Director of National Intelligence has ruled out the virus being human-made and noted that is the scientific consensus as well.)

After two doses, scientists will closely track which participants — those getting real shots, or a dummy — experience more infections as they go about their daily routines, especially in hard-hit areas where the virus still is spreading. Testing is planned at close to 90 sites, officials said.
 “Unfortunately for the United States of America, we have plenty of infections right now” to get that answer, the government's top infectious-disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said recently.
 Several other vaccines made by China and by Britain’s Oxford University began smaller final-stage tests in Brazil and other hard-hit countries earlier this month. But the U.S. requires its own tests of any vaccine that might be used in the country.
 Every month through the fall, the government-funded COVID-19 Prevention Network will roll out a new study of a leading candidate, each with 30,000 volunteers, to test not only whether the shots work but whether they are safe.
 The final U.S. study of the Oxford shot is set to begin in August, followed by a candidate from Johnson & Johnson in September and one from Novavax in October. Pfizer Inc. plans its own 30,000-person study this summer.
 It normally takes years to create a accine from scratch, but scientists are setting speed records this time, spurred by knowledge that vaccination is the world’s best hope against the pandemic.
 Governments around the world are already trying to stockpile millions of doses of the leading candidates so that immunizations can begin immediately if the vaccines win approval. But the first available doses will most likely be reserved for people at highest risk.
 “We’re optimistic, cautiously optimistic” that the vaccine will work and that “toward the end of the year” there will be data to prove it, Dr. Stephen Hoge, president of Massachusetts-based Moderna, told a House subcommittee last week.

Center fielder/second baseman Jase Glassburn hit .328, but the rest of the Knights — Lancaster (who also played first base), Thomas (who also played second base), outfielders Matt Clawson and Hayden France, third baseman Alex Reinoehl and designated hitter Andrew Osborn — all were in the .200s, and it took France's last hit of the season for him to reach that level. "Not an offensive powerhouse," Trout admitted.
 The Knights beat West Vigo to open sectional play, after splitting with the Vikings during the regular season, then beat Sullivan and what Trout called "a very good Owen Valley team" by a 2-0 score to win the sectional.
 "I had been on a sectional winner as a player [in that 2005 campaign] . . . but it took me three years to win one as a coach," Trout said. "Fortunately, I had a lot of people around me who had been there."
 Jim Tucker was one of his assistants, but Trout also had selected a couple of veterans for his staff — former basketball coach Mitch Lancaster and Tony Trout, Craig's father. Former baseball and volleyball coach Scott McDonald was also available for advice.
 "We went to Crawfordsville for the regional and played Brebeuf, a very good hitting team, and it was a total slugfest," Craig Trout recalled. His Knights responded, however, winning that game 8-7 and then downing Indian Creek 11-4 in the championship game that night.
 "And that's when coach Lancaster said to me, 'Let's get greedy,' " Craig Trout added.
 Evansville Memorial had sidelined Jasper, so Northview didn't have to play the host team at the semistate. Although Clay City wasn't able to make it a Clay County sweep, the Eels losing to Lanesville in the first of the two games at Jasper, the Knights got a shutout from Tucker and beat Memorial 5-0.
 The game-breaking play was a perfectly placed bunt by Glassburn that ignited a big inning. "It was a surreal moment, knowing we were going to Victory Field," the coach recalls.
 Omens weren't good for the Knights during state-finals week. A power outage forced the pep session for the team to be moved, rains forced some of the Northview practices indoors and some younger kids "borrowed" some of the Knights' equipment from their practice field. On the way to Victory Field, a traffic jam forced the team bus to drive on the shoulder of the highway to enable the team to arrive on time — only to have the preceding game to go extra innings and force both Western and the Knights to have to sit and wait.
 "It felt like everything was against us," Craig Trout said.
 But Tucker, after giving up a two-out RBI single in the top of the second inning, allowed just one hit the rest of the way. The Knights — who their coach said "never hit in the first five innings" — tied the score in the bottom of the fifth when Lancaster's leadoff single became a run thanks to a two-out error. And with two out in the bottom of the sixth, Reinoehl drew a walk, Lancaster got another hit and then France hit the RBI single for the championship-winning run.
 As indicated, Northview was hard to scout because a different hero seemed to emerge whenever one was needed.
 "That's how selfless they were," Trout said proudly. "They didn't care [who got the credit]. Not a bunch of [Division I] guys, but grinders . . . gritty, blue-collar. They epitomized what I always think of our community."
