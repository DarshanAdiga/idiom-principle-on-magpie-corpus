Over the last several months, I’ve been spending even more time in my home garden and landscape, and many of you may have done the same. But the pesky, hot summer temperatures have finally settled in, and now I’m looking for plants that look good in the heat without needing much supervision.
 A fantastic group of plants for the Mississippi summer landscape is the Rudbeckia. You might call them black-eyed Susans. Many Rudbeckias have been recognized regionally and nationally for their garden resilience and easy care. Let’s take a look at five of my favorite Rudbeckias.
 Rudbeckia Indian Summer was selected as a Mississippi Medallion winner in 1999 and has been a reliable performer in my landscape every year.

It can be a huge relief to realize that the person who has been making your life difficult is a narcissist -- to be able to put a single word to the gaslighting, lack of empathy, and other ways in which they may have hurt you and others. But while it can be meaningful to have this information, does not necessarily mean you should share it with that person.
 "It feels like a revelation, it feels like the moment you get the one thing nobody ever gets in a relationship with a narcissist, and that's justice," says clinical psychologist Dr. Ramani Durvasula. Unfortunately, a narcissist isn't just waiting for you to get their number in order to then change their behavior.
 "Not only is it not going to change anything, it's probably going to make things worse," she says. "They're going to look at you, they're going to turn it around, and they're going to say, 'Really? Because I would say _you're_ the narcissist.' And then they'll go on a 20-minute tirade about how you're the narcissist, and they'll gaslight you, and they'll manipulate you, and they'll throw in some insults, and by the time they're done with you and they've done that number on you, you _are_ going to think you're the narcissist. Is that really worth it?"
 The real reason why simply confronting a narcissist and calling them out for their behavior won't work is simple: they're not actually listening to you. If they truly are a narcissist, they have _never_ been listening, and are especially unlikely to take any criticism or feedback on board.

 In 2009, Hawkins married his current wife Melanie, whose daughters Caroline and Annabelle were ages 4 and 2 at the time.
 “We began with conversations on Facebook,” he said. “Then three months later, we were out on a date. And the rest is history.”
 Hawkins said the union of both families has been a blessing.
 “I am so happy to see the voids filled where the kids once had uncertainties about having a mom and a dad,” he said. “I enjoy the dancing, the cheering, the laughter. I just embrace the chaos that comes with a blended family — especially a house full of girls.”

Unfortunately, for decades, many African governments have treated the flow of aid as a permanent source of income. Perhaps Trump's threatened "freeze" on U.S. foreign aid is a much-needed wake up call for African leaders to take the driver's seat of economic management by prioritising domestic financing and investment.

Some months before, Brick had fought cancer alone. He didn't want his younger brother, André, to know about his problems; André had a career to manage. He didn't want to tell his big brother, Dwayne, about his illness; Dwayne lost his job, had a teenage son and a baby-mama who demanded more child support.
 It was money that ended Brick's last relationship. Money that put him in strange women's beds. What else would being broke cost him?
 These days, there are three things you can count on for sure: The sun will rise tomorrow. It'll rain somewhere in the world. And author Eric Jerome Dickey will tell a good story.
 This one is a little bit different, though.
 You shouldn't be surprised that there's plenty of sleeping around in "The Business of Lovers" or that it's graphic, so be warned. It's filled with grown-up drama but at the risk of spoiling, you can expect a happy ending that you won't expect. It's got a touch of humor, the sly kind. This book's profane, even nasty but none of it gets out of hand, that's the most enjoyable part of it. You're leisurely taken through a surprisingly small community of characters on a tight number of mattresses with a mini-arsenal of plot moves, a lack of too much that's absolutely refreshing, like a cool drink beneath hot sheets.
 That's what you want this summer, right? So whether you're stuck inside or turnt out, "The Business of Lovers" is on the money.
 "The Business of Lovers" by Eric Jerome Dickey, 387 pages, c. 2020, Dutton, $27.
