In an interview with Turkey's state-run news agency on Tuesday, Turkish FM Mevl√ºt √áavu≈üoƒülu stressed in his comments that the 2016 agreement between Turkey and the European Union needs to be updated. The top diplomat also added that EU visa liberalisation and an update of the country's customs union with the bloc must be implemented to help solve the migrant issue. Turkey said on Tuesday a 2016 migration deal with the EU needs to be updated in light of the crisis in northern Syria, as tensions continued to flare on the Turkish-Greek border after Ankara said it would no longer to stop migrants trying to cross. In an interview with state-owned Anadolu news agency, Foreign Minister Mevl√ºt √áavu≈üoƒülu said that European Union visa liberalisation and an update of the country's customs union with the bloc must be implemented to help solve the migrant issue. 'If we reach an agreement by March 26 when there will be an EU leaders' summit, this issue will come on to the agenda of this meeting,' √áavu≈üoƒülu said. 'We are ready for constructive work,' he added. 'If we are to come up with a roadmap with the EU, we expect them to be sincere,' The top diplomat said in a statement. 'It is not only about keeping migrants in return for more money,' he added. Late on Monday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan left meetings in Brussels with EU and NATO leaders without issuing a joint statement nor appearing at a joint news conference, as had been planned. Erdoƒüan made the trip to Brussels as a dispute deepened over the fate of tens of thousands of migrants trying to enter EU-member Greece. Ankara decided last month to encourage the migration to extract more European support and funding in its military effort in Syria's Idlib region. Turkey hosts 3.6 million Syrian migrants and has stemmed migration to Europe under the 2016 deal in return for billions of euros in aid. But it has become frustrated with what it regards as too little European support over the war in Syria, where its troops faced off against Russian-backed Assad forces. The pact also envisaged the EU taking in thousands of Syrian refugees directly from camps in Turkey, rewarding Turks with visa-free travel to the bloc, faster progress in EU membership talks and upgrading their customs union.

'We are ready for a constructive study ... We expect sincerity from the EU. The era of stringing Turkey along is over,' Turkish Foreign Minister Mevl√ºt √áavu≈üoƒülu said in his comments as giving an exclusive interview to Turkey's state-run new agency on Thursday. The European Union should stop 'stringing Turkey along' over helping out with the millions of migrants on its territory, the country's foreign minister said Tuesday, a day after the two sides agreed to review a 4-year-old deal aimed at stemming refugee flows to Europe. Mevl√ºt √áavu≈üoƒülu said the EU has to take 'sincere' steps to help Turkey manage the flow of migrants, including finding ways to ensure Syrian refugees can return home. The minister spoke a day after President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan held a meeting with top EU officials in Brussels during which the sides agreed to review their 2016 deal on migrants. The meeting was called after thousands of migrants massed on Turkey's border with Greece, following the Turkish government's decision to open its borders to migrants wanting to cross into Europe. Greece has deployed riot police and border guards to prevent the crossings, sparking clashes between migrants and Greek security forces. Erdoƒüan has demanded that Europe shoulder more of the burden of caring for Syrian refugees on Turkish territory -- thought to number more than 3.5 million. Turkey is accusing the EU of not meeting its obligations under the 2016 agreement, including failing to pay money promised to Turkey to stem the flow of migrants to Europe. Following the talks in Brussels late Monday, European Council President Charles Michel said teams headed by √áavu≈üoƒülu and EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borell, would work 'in the next days to clarify the implementation of the deal between Turkey and the EU to be certain that we are on the same page.' 'We are ready for a constructive study ... We expect sincerity from the EU. The era of stringing Turkey along is over,' √áavu≈üoƒülu told state-run Anadolu Agency. √áavu≈üoƒülu said the sides would work toward 'updating' the Turkey-EU deal in line with recent developments, including the situation in Syria's northwestern Idlib province, where a Assad regime offensive has driven thousands of Syrians toward the border with Turkey. The 2016 agreement is not 'about the EU giving money to Turkey to keep the refugees,' √áavu≈üoƒülu said. 'It comprises several issues from visa-free travel to ensuring the voluntary return of refugees.' The minister said the sides would try to draft a 'road map' in time for a EU summit on March 26. Under the 2016 agreement, the EU offered Turkey up to 6 billion euros ($6.7 billion) in aid for the Syrian refugees it hosts, fast- tracked EU membership and other incentives to stop Europe-bound migrants. The number arriving in Greece from Turkey dropped dramatically after the deal took effect.

Dear Dave,   We live in Colorado, and we need some advice on protecting our assets. My wife is a teacher, and I'm a nurse. We make around $180,000 a year combined, and we're set to pay off our home next month. We also have two teenagers who are both driving, so we were wondering about the best way to protect everything if one of them has an accident and we get sued, or something else tragic happens.   Spencer
 Dear Spencer,   With your income, and the stage you're in when it comes to wealth building, I think it's time to add an umbrella policy. This is a liability policy, and you could probably buy an extra million in liability coverage for around $250 a year. It attaches to the liability policy that's already part of your homeowners and car insurance.   With a couple of teenage drivers in the house, it might run a little more than $250, but I wouldn't think it would be much more, if any. It would just add an extra million to the mix, just in case someone decided they were going to come after you because of a bad situation.   As you continue building wealth later, like if you get into real estate and start buying rental properties, make sure you put those in a limited liability company (LLC). You're not there quite yet, but it's always a good idea to plan ahead and do whatever you can to keep the size of the target on your back relatively small.   Dave
 Control your own destiny   Dear Dave,   I have a pension plan that will pay me 80% of my top three highest years' income. Should I continue to invest 15% towards retirement? I will top out at $79,000 yearly, and I plan on retiring in 28 years.   Jordan
 Dear Jordan,   You should always put 15% of your income into retirement once you reach Baby Step 4. I would never count on a pension as my only retirement income, because the truth is many pension funds are very poorly managed.   You'll probably get the pension when the time comes. I'm not predicting it will go broke or anything like that, but there's no way I would leave the financial state of my retirement in other people's hands. That's exactly what you're doing when your plan is to count on a pension or Social Security. With Roth IRAs, 401(k)s and so forth, you're building wealth that you control.   You have to control the controllables, Jordan. There are plenty of things in our lives we have no control over whatsoever, but you have to take charge of the stuff you can control in order to win. Building wealth is one of those things!   Dave

If bigotry is a crime in America, Dr. Alma Lynch will be doing hard time behind bars. While she was running for election to the U.S. House to represent Texas' 23rd Congressional District, the Republican candidate suggested that spraying the nation with pig's blood would keep Muslims out of the US. What planet does this doctor live on? This is the most ludicrous anti-Muslim suggestion I heard!
 For the information of Lynch, yes, Muslims are allowed to touch pork and they will not be banned from Heaven as a result. They are only expected take a shower afterwards! The same goes to anyone who goes to the petting zoo, after petting the animals, she or he are supposed to wash their hands afterwards for sanitary reason.
 The Qur'an states that a Muslim cannot eat carrion, blood, or the flesh of the swine. As in Judaism, eating pork is considered a sin in Islam. Both the Qur'an and the Bible consider the animal to be unclean.
 When faced with starvation and there is no food left, the Qur'an allows Muslims to eat pork providing they do not fill up their bellies.

 The Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) is urging that the safety of asylum seekers at Greece's borders be ensured in line with human rights law. Greek officials' announcements that the asylum seekers will be pushed back is in violation of human rights and EU law, said a statement by the OIC's Human Rights Commission. Referring to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights Article 14, the statement said, 'Everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution.' 'The commission supports the UN Refugees High Commission's statement on March 2, 2020, which calls for the states to not suspend applications by asylum seekers, who are under protection according to the UN's 1951 Refugee Convention. 'States also have the responsibility to not discriminate between asylum seekers based on their religious views. The only way to solve the asylum seekers' crisis in the long run is to respect human rights law. We invite OIC countries and the international community to support asylum-seekers and provide services for them,' it said. The OIC's Human Rights Commission has members from 18 countries, including Hacƒ± Ali A√ßƒ±kg√ºl of the Justice Ministry's Human Rights Division. Late last month, Turkey announced it would no longer stop asylum seekers from reaching Europe by land, while banning boat crossings as too dangerous. In making the decision, Turkey complained that the European Union had failed to keep its pledges under a 2016 deal on migrants, and warned of a new refugee wave coming from the embattled province of Idlib, Syria, along Turkey's southern border. Thousands of asylum seekers have since flocked to Turkey's Edirne province-which borders Greece and Bulgaria-to make their way to Europe. Turkey has also criticized what it calls Greek authorities' brutality towards the asylum seekers at the border. Turkey, which already hosts nearly 4 million Syrian migrants, more than any other country in the world, has said it would be unable to absorb yet another refugee wave. Escalating attacks by the Assad regime and its allies in Idlib, Syria has sent a fresh wave of refugees toward Turkey's border.

The weather is warming up, signs of the spring are up in the air, and with the changing season also comes the possibility of hazardous and extreme weather, local meteorologist Dan Schreiber warned Del Rio and area residents.
 ‚ÄúSpringtime is nearly upon us here in South Central Texas. In fact, with the volatile weather we‚Äôve seen in the past month, we‚Äôve already seen our first signs of a changing season in the atmosphere,‚Äù Schreiber, a certified consulting meteorologist with STWX Strategic Weather Consulting said.
 Schreiber said spring in Del Rio often brings much-needed rainfall, warming temperatures, and a transition from dormant plants to new, green life. However, the exit out of wintertime doesn‚Äôt always happen peacefully.
 ‚ÄúDel Rio is generally one of the first places in the United States to begin transition into springtime, because of our southern latitude. Spring weather is often first noted in February in Del Rio. Officially, the National Weather Service calls March 1 the beginning of ‚Äòmeteorological spring,‚Äô‚Äù he said.
