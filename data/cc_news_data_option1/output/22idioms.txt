Pawsh organized his first Doggie Bowl last year, in which the dogs were brought to Play Care, divided into teams and released into the enclosed area, which had become a soccer field covered in toys. Dogs that brought toys to any of the designated end zones scored touchdowns for their teams, and the packages with the most touchdowns won the game. Later, Pawsh staff edited the footage of this game to look like a Super Bowl broadcast, complete with a "halftime show" with videos of dogs and cats doing tricks, and posted on Pawsh's social media pages the weekend of the Great Game of the NFL.

The match that actually began Liverpool's run was on January 12, 2019, a 1-0 victory over Brighton and Hove Albion, meaning they are technically still 10 days off hitting the one-year mark from the start of the unbeaten streak.
 In that time they have played 37 Premier League matches, winning 32 and dropping points just five times.
 That form has Liverpool firmly on track for a maiden Premier League title and first top-flight crown for 30 years; they sit 13 points clear with a game in hand on their rivals.
 Nevertheless, Liverpool still have some way to go to match Arsenal's record- breaking run.
 The Gunners' 49-match unbeaten streak in the Premier League started in the 2002-03 season and stretched all the way through to 2004-05, beginning on May 7, 2003 and ending October 24, 2004 in a defeat to Manchester United.
 That run lasted 536 days, though Arsenal drew 13 times in that period, meaning Liverpool are already close to matching their haul of 36 victories during the record-breaking period.
 Liverpool still have Chelsea to overtake as well. The Blues, under the guidance of Jose Mourinho at the time, went 40 Premier League matches without defeat between October 23, 2004 and November 6, 2005 – 379 days.
 Preston North End (23 matches, 1888-1889) and Nottingham Forest (42 matches, 1977-78) were both unbeaten for 378 days, meaning Liverpool's current run is the fifth-longest in terms of days in English football history.
 They are next in Premier League action on January 11 at Mourinho's Tottenham.

When Kea Turner's 74-year-old grandmother checked into Virginia's Sentara Virginia Beach General Hospital with advanced lung cancer, she landed in the oncology unit where every patient was monitored by a bed alarm.      "Even if she would slightly roll over, it would go off," Turner said. Small movements - such as reaching for a tissue - would set off the alarm, as well. The beeping would go on for up to 10 minutes, Turner said, until a nurse arrived to shut it off.      Tens of thousands of alarms shriek, beep and buzz every day in every U.S. hospital. All sound urgent, but few require immediate attention or get it.      Intended to keep patients safe alerting nurses to potential problems, they also create a riot of disturbances for patients trying to heal and get some rest.      Nearly every machine in a hospital is now outfitted with an alarm - infusion pumps, ventilators, bedside monitors tracking blood pressure, heart activity and a drop in oxygen in the blood. Even beds are alarmed to detect movement that might portend a fall. The glut of noise means that the medical staff is less likely to respond.      Alarms have ranked as one of the top 10 health technological hazards every year since 2007, according to the research firm ECRI Institute. That could mean staffs were too swamped with alarms to notice a patient in distress or that the alarms were misconfigured. The Joint Commission, which accredits hospitals, warned the nation about the "frequent and persistent" problem of alarm safety in 2013. It now requires hospitals to create formal processes to tackle alarm system safety, but there is no national data on whether progress has been made in reducing the prevalence of false and unnecessary alarms.      The commission has estimated that of the thousands of alarms going off throughout a hospital every day, an estimated 85% to 99% do not require clinical intervention. Staff, facing widespread "alarm fatigue," can miss critical alerts, leading to patient deaths. Patients may get anxious about fluctuations in heart rate or blood pressure that are perfectly normal, the commission said.      And bed alarms, a recent arrival, can lead to immobility and dangerous loss of muscle mass when patients are terrified that any movement will set off the bleeps.      An 'epidemic of immobility'   In the past 30 years, the number of medical devices that generate alarms has risen from about 10 to nearly 40, said Priyanka Shah, a senior project engineer at ECRI Institute. A breathing ventilator alone can emit 30 to 40 different noises, she said.      In addition to triggering bed alarms, patients who move in bed may set off false alarms from pulse oximeters, which measure the oxygen in a patient's blood, or carbon dioxide monitors, which measure the level of the gas in someone's breath, she said.      Shah said she has seen hospitals reduce unneeded alarms, but doing so is "a constant work in progress."      'Cry wolf phenomenon'   Maria Cvach, an alarm expert and director of policy management and integration for Johns Hopkins Health System, found that on one step-down unit (a level below intensive care) in the hospital in 2006, an average of 350 alarms went off per patient per day, from the cardiac monitor alone.      She said no international standard exists for what these alarms sound like, so they vary by manufacturer and device. "It's really impossible for the staff to identify by sound everything that they hear," she said.      The flood of alarms creates a "cry wolf phenomenon," Cvach said. The alarms are "constantly calling for help. The staff look at them. They say that's just a false alarm - they may ignore the real alarm."      Bed alarms, for example, are meant to summon nurses so they can supervise patients to walk safely. But research has shown that the use of alarms doesn't prevent falls. Nursing staffs are often stretched thin and don't reach the bedside before a patient hits the ground.      Meanwhile, patients may feel immobilized at a time when even a few hundred steps per day could significantly improve their recovery. Immobility in the hospital can create other problems for patients, leaving them with often irreversible functional decline, research has shown.      Bed alarms have proliferated since 2008, when the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services declared hospital falls should "never" happen and stopped paying for injuries related to those falls. After that policy change, the odds of nurses using a bed alarm increased 2.3 times, according to a study led by Dr. Ronald Shorr, director of the Geriatric Research, Education and Clinical Center at the Malcom Randall Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Gainesville, Florida. The alarms have become a standard feature in new hospital beds.      But Shorr noted that, in contrast, bed alarms are being removed from other settings: In 2017, CMS began discouraging their widespread use in nursing homes, arguing that audible bed or chair alarms may be considered a "restraint" if the resident "is afraid to move to avoid setting off the alarm."

BAY ST. LOUIS, Miss. (WLOX) - If you’re looking forward to eating healthy in 2020 and not sure where to start, Wholey foods in Bay St. Louis can help you out. If you’re looking forward to eating healthy in 2020 and not sure where to start, Wholey foods in Bay St. Louis can help you out.Healthy eating, such as whole foods and clean meat, is the focus of Wholey Foods. Owner of Starfish Café Zachary Fillhart has taken over for a friend, creating the new eatery. “We purchased out Zone Meals To Go, but we’re keeping her same model of meal planning, and we brought some of our recipes over from Starfish Café and switched everything over to clean meats. So there’s no nitrites or any preservatives in any of our meats anymore,” Fillhart said. Fillhart said healthy eating is not a diet but more of a lifestyle. Wholey Foods’ meal plans are five days of breakfast, lunch and dinner, creating 15 meals total.“Our goal is to change how you think about food,” he said.While changing the perspective people have on healthy eating, Fillhart has created four different plans. “We have a Simply one, which is based off a Whole 30 type of diet, a lot of vegetables and fruits, all clean protein. We have a Basic plan that will add some dairy and grain back into the Simply diet plan, and then we have an active plan that will double your protein," he said.All meals are freshly cooked, stored and labeled with dates. Fillhart said meal planning will begin around the first week in February.“Which people can pick them up from here and target range from here to Ocean Springs,” he said.It is recommended that the food is eaten or frozen no later than seven days. Before meals go out in February, the storage containers will be biodegradable.Wholey Foods took over about two weeks ago and can be found on Facebook, but the page is still linked to Zone Meals To Go. However, the website will be up and running Monday if you’re interested in placing an order. They will also be accepting orders for Keto king cakes. Copyright 2020 WLOX. All rights reserved.

Mother Nature was not really kind to Pine Bluff in late Spring and early Summer as first a tornado and then massive flooding affected a number of residents.
   
 First was the E-F1 tornado that hit May 9, displacing approximately 200 families and knocking down power lines and poles in southeast part of the city.
   
 According to the National Weather Service, the tornado packed winds of between 86 and 110 miles per hour, was 100 yards wide and traveled 0.26 miles, starting on South Wisconsin Street and then headed northeast over the Myranda Place Apartments which sustained heavy damage.
   
 Reports from the scene indicated that at least two walls caved in, leaving apartments exposed. Trees and utility poles were snapped and at least two trees were uprooted.
   
 Shortly after the tornado hit, a shelter was set up at the Pine Bluff Convention Center where approximately 50 people were sent. Mayor Shirley Washington was at the center to assist and said "We have had outreach from citizens and churches all offering their support. It is times like this that you realize the true meaning of community."
   
 In addition to Pine Bluff Police and firefighters, help came quickly in the form of Jefferson County Sheriff's Deputies, Arkansas State Troopers, the White Hall Police and Fire Departments and some other volunteer firefighters.
   
 White Hall Mayor Noel Foster said he knew that if his city had a need, the city of Pine Bluff would respond so he did not hesitate in sending help.
   
 "The City of White Hall will always respond to help those in need," Foster said. "We enjoy a great relationship with Pine Bluff Mayor Shirley Washington and the Mayor's leadership team. Pine Bluff would do the same to help us if we were in need."
   
 There were no fatalities and only a few minor injuries as a result of the tornado.
   
 Less than a month later, flooding on the Arkansas River affected cities from Fort Smith all the way south and Pine Bluff was no exception.
   
 By May 28, the river stood at 44.5 feet and was continuing to rise. Flood stage at Pine Bluff is 42 feet. Water surrounded homes in the Island Harbor area, as well as Riverside Drive, Knotts Island, Wright-Pastoria and Trulock Bay.
   
 Regional Park was flooded, forcing the closing of the Delta Rivers Nature Center, which now is not expected to reopen until early in 2020. Also the Harbor Oaks Golf Course and restaurant were flooded and the campers that had been staying in the park moved to higher ground, taking their vehicles to the Pine Bluff Convention Center.
   
 County Judge Gerald Robinson and Office of Emergency Management Coordinator Karen Blevins coordinated the county's response to the conditions and expressed concern not only about the areas that had already flooded but about the possibility of flooding in the Packingtown area on the extreme northeast side of Pine Bluff.
   
 Those fears proved to be groundless as the levees in the area held and Packingtown was spared flooding.
   
 On June 6, Robinson said in an interview that over 550 homes had been affected, describing it as "millions and millions of dollars as far as damages go. We haven't been able to put down a dollar figure yet but as the water recedes, we will start to make some determinations,"
   
 According to a report, the river finally crested at 50.8 feet on June 7 at the slackwater harbor in the Port of Pine Bluff, making it the second highest in history locally. In 1943, the river crested at 52.1 feet.

GULFPORT, Miss. (WLOX) - Despite the dark clouds that seemed to hang over the 2019 Gulf Coast fishing season, Mike Wright is pursuing his dream to open a bait &amp; tackle shop in Gulfport.“I had told someone that I had walked into a tackle shop when I was younger and I had seen the guys sitting around talking about fishing, and I love fishing, and I thought that would be the coolest job ever,” Wright said. “I got it in my head that I wanted to do it. And when my wife and I settled here in Mississippi, I realized this is the place.”Wicked Fish Bait &amp; Tackle opened its doors Thursday morning, despite a wicked 2019 for those who fished or made their living on the water."Last year was terrible for fishing and the whole industry,” Wright added. “A lot of people got hurt by it, but I felt like the timing is right for this and it’s going to be perfect.”Wright also hopes the location just off U.S. 49 is perfect. The shop sits next to a gas station, so he hopes customers will get food and drinks next door, then visit him to get their fishing supplies."The places where my wife and I have been, you know, it didn’t seem right. But coming here, this is the nicest bunch of people I’ve been around. So I said we’re going to buy a house here and open up the tackle shop,” Wright said.Copyright 2020 WLOX. All rights reserved.

Perched above a beautiful setting surrounded by water, palm trees and historic buildings, Ponce Inlet, Florida, offers travelers scenic views, science and more.      Inlet visitors can climb 175 feet, up 203 stairs, to reach a beautiful view of the Atlantic Ocean and the inlet at the Ponce De Leon Inlet Light Station. The complex features the lighthouse, Ponce Inlet Museum and the buildings once used by the U.S. Coast Guard.      The museum offers self-guided tours that take a deep look into the history of the lighthouse and light station. Learn about the men and their families who were the lighthouse keepers and took charge of lighting the paths for those at sea.   The lighthouse became automated in 1953. In 1970 the Coast Guard moved from the light station, leaving the historic structures vacant. A lot of damage was done by vandals -- however, citizens took it upon themselves to get the property deeded to the town of Ponce Inlet. The property was restored to a museum and the station was listed on the National Register of Historic Places -- one of only a few light stations that had the buildings intact. It is now listed as a privately operated aid to navigation.      Guided group tours for 10 or more are available. For those wanting a different experience, sign up for the Climb to the Moon tour. The "old lighthouse keeper" will take history buffs on a trip to discover the history of the lighthouse. It takes place monthly on the eve of each full moon. Dates and times are listed at ponceinlet.org. The climb offers awesome moonlit views of the Atlantic Ocean, the world's most famous beach (Daytona), the inlet and inland waterways. Toast the full moon with a sparkling beverage as it rises over the water. Hors d'oeuvres are provided. Tickets may be purchased in advance by emailing admin@ponceinlet.org or calling 386-210-3660, ext. 10.      Or, take the two-hour Climb with the Keeper Tour. It is an intimate, informative time with the "old lighthouse keeper" to tour the museum when no other guests are present. It includes the entire lighthouse area and some that are normally closed to the general public. To jump in on this tour, email mwentzel@ponceinlet.org or call 386-210-3660, ext. 18.   Reservations are required for the special tours, and each costs $35 per person.      Tips for your visit:   • Climbers should be in good physical condition.   • Wear closed-toed shoes with non-slip soles and low heels. Flip-flops, sandals and high-heeled shoes are not recommended.   • Children must be able to climb the tower on their own.      Another climb awaits Ponce Inlet visitors at the observation tower at the Marine Science Center. The tower offers views of the estuary. Spend time with the turtles, eagles, owls and hawks, and feed the stingrays. A visit offers a great behind the scenes look into the rescue, rehabilitation and release of sick and injured turtles and birds. Visitors can observe the sea turtle patients and the operation of the hospital. It offers an opportunity to learn about the Florida marine ecosystems and animals that are indigenous to the area.      Touch a stingray and explore the nature trail; walk through the Mary Keller Bird Sanctuary, an area where the birds that no longer can live in the wild live a good life in Florida. During the Raptors Live program, visitors meet the birds of prey up close. Animal education programs are presented daily. Visit marinesciencecenter.com for times and pricing.

Tennis and cricket stars spearheaded by Nick Kyrgios and Chris Lynn on Friday pledged support for victims of bushfires raging around Australia, donating cash for every ace or six they hit. The blazes have claimed 18 lives and forced mass evacuations, with the country bracing for a weekend heatwave expected to fan the deadly infernos.Kyrgios, a controversial figure with a bad boy reputation, has been at the forefront of rallying support and pledged Aus200 US140 for each ace he serves across the Australian summer of tennis, starting with the ATP Cup which began Friday. Im kicking off the support for those affected by the fires. Ill be donating 200 per ace that I hit across all the events I play this summer, tweeted the 24-year-old, who was handed a 16-week suspended ban in September after a series of outbursts.His Australian teammate at the inaugural ATP Cup Alex de Minaur went one better. I like this, I will go 250 per ace, just because I dont think Ill be hitting as many aces as you mate, he replied, with Australian veteran Samantha Stosur also pledging 200 per ace.Kyrgios, who will also play the Kooyong Classic and the Australian Open this month, on Thursday, issued a call for fundraisers for victims of the fires, which prompted Australias tennis chief Craig Tiley to get on board. We want to help these communities in a meaningful way and will announce a number of fundraising and support initiatives that will be rolled out across the ATP Cup, Australian Open and our other events over the coming weeks, said Tiley.The fires have been a big talking point ahead of the 24-team ATP Cup, which is being staged in Brisbane, Perth and Sydney with top names including Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal playing. - Extra motivation -Tournament director Tom Larner announced that each ace served at the 10-day event would deliver Aus100 to bushfire relief.The initiative is forecast to raise around Aus150,000, with more than 1,500 aces expected to be sent down over the duration of the January 3-12 tournament. Most of the players are already keen to score aces and win a quick point, and having the chance to raise money for the bushfire appeal will give them that extra bit of motivation, he said.There are fears that smoke haze could impact the tournament in Sydney, with officials relying on on-site medical experts to monitor air quality, although there were no concerns on Friday. The third cricket Test in Sydney between Australia and New Zealand is also monitoring for smoke, with players wearing black armbands Friday as a mark of respect for those who have died.Two of the biggest hitters in the game, Lynn and Glenn Maxwell, announced they would donate 250 for every six they smash during the ongoing Big Bash League Twenty20 tournament. Hey Guys, for every six I hit in this years Big Bash League I will donate 250 towards the Red Cross Bushfire Appeal, tweeted Lynn.It is special to see so many athletes from various sports getting in behind the real heroes who are fighting to save lives and properties around our country. Maxwell, back in action after a short mental health sabbatical, replied Love it Lynny Ill match you on 250 per six I hit in this years BBL. DArcy Short, who was last week added to Australias squad for their upcoming one-day tour of India, also jumped on board with the same commitment.

MANKATO, Minn. (KEYC) - Private glass–blowing lessons are available at the Mankato Makerspace for those who want to delve into an age- old art form.It’s the ancient art of glass blowing and at the Mankato Makerspace it’s very much alive.During one of local artist Dustin Swier’s private sessions, participants learn to create something out of almost nothing.After a quick safety brief and demonstration, Swier guides those in the session through imaginative and systemic processes of working with glass.“I really appreciate the fluidity of glass, and it’s really this nice marriage of science and art. It’s kind of right where they come together. So you use your scientific mind of understanding techniques and processes, and then your artistic mind to be able to be creative and work flexibly,” says Swier.Using a glass–blowing process known as “lampworking,” those in the class superheat, bend, stretch and form their very own works of art.“I really enjoy being very intricate trying to do that dance and that balance that glass blowing kind of takes. When I was younger with my parents we would always go to the Renaissance, and watching the glass blowers is one of the things I always wanted to go to see because I always thought it was very impressive. It’s awe-inspiring just how they can work with the glass like that,” says class attendee Kolten Espinosa.Like most art forms, inspiration and creation are at the heart of glass–working.“Really that inspiration that it is something that can be worked with. You can push and pull and stretch the glass. So just that inspiration of being able to take something that was almost unknown and make it a little more approachable,” says Swier.Swier holds intermediate and advanced sessions at the Mankato Makerspace.
