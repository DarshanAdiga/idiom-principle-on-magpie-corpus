Scheduled home test matches against Wales and England in June and July this year were also called off, meaning the Brave Blossoms have not played a match since their World Cup quarterfinal defeat to South Africa on Oct. 20 last year.
 Head coach Jamie Joseph said “no stone had been left unturned” to find a way for the team to assemble at home or overseas before the end of the year, but the demands of international rugby made it impossible to go into the European tournament underprepared.
 “I’m very disappointed that we weren’t able to play any rugby this year,” said Joseph, who signed a new contract after the World Cup. “I feel for the players, first and foremost. Our players have been working very hard behind the scenes to ensure that they were in the right condition to start our training camps, so I’m really disappointed for all of their efforts. I’m disappointed for the fans as well, because after last year’s World Cup efforts and results, it would have been great to continue our way along our rugby path.”
