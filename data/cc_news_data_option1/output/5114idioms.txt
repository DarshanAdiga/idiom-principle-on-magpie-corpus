(WALB) -More than a month after a Sumter County couple lost several of their pets in a house fire, they are still hunting for answers on how the fire started.Six weeks later, the Duke family is still in shock after their family home of two years caught fire as they were sound asleep in bed.“I’ve lost everything,” said homeowner, Stacey Duke.Stacey DukeShe and her husband, Bobby, owns the house that went up in frames.Half their home went up in flames and the other half was damaged by just smoke and heat alone.Stacey said parts of the home got so hot that it melted precious family photos off the walls and smoke damaged all of the married couple’s clothes.Stacey said a jacket she used to enjoy wearing shrunk from the heat.A few keepsakes were found among the broken glass and ashes including a framed cross that has special meaning in Stacey’s heart.“I’ve been looking for it for the last five weeks and I finally found it.”Time has not healed all wounds for this couple after they lost their Jack Russell rescue pup, Chloe, and two cats on that horrific night.“She (Chloe) didn’t make it out and that’s the hardest part that I’m having to deal with as well as the fact not knowing how it started,” said Duke.Investigators told us wiring issues have been ruled out as the cause.They are open to any other possibles at this point including arson.Sgt. Chad Ciani with the Sumter County Sheriff’s Office said it’s uncommon in this area for arson.He told us they have no suspects but have interviewed several people.Investigator and Sargent Chad CianiNow they are looking for new leads and help from the public on what happened in the early morning hours of October 29.Sgt.

NASHVILLE, Tenn.
 Sarah Fuller became the first woman to score in a Power Five conference football game by kicking an extra point for Vanderbilt on Saturday.
 The goalkeeper for Vanderbilt's Southeastern Conference women's soccer champs didn't get a chance on the Commodores' first two drives against in-state rival Tennessee. But the Commodores drove late in the first quarter, running for a first down on fourth-and-1.
 On the next play, Ken Seals threw an 18-yard pass to Cam Johnson for a touchdown. Fuller, listed second out of three available kickers on the depth chart, came out for the extra point, which tied the game at 7 with 1:50 left in the first quarter.
 The 6-foot-2 senior put the ball through the uprights and celebrated by pulling her first in before slapping high-fives with teammates. She ran off the field with a big smile with her family in the stands all with their arms up in the air.
 An official gave Fuller the ball on the sideline.

“Miku was out for nine games and Onwu for nine games as well in the previous season. But now we have to adjust. We have a plan B. To put in Sunil (Chhetri) in a number nine will not be apt as he will be able to give more to the team in a different position. We have got three number nine foreigners. They are getting ready game after game. Cleiton (Silva) has got good chances and they are getting close. Just because he is not getting the goals, he is getting criticised,” reasoned Cuadrat.

HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — Connecticut officials are paying $250,000 and admitting no wrongdoing in a settlement of a lawsuit brought by a state prison inmate who gave birth on a toilet in her cell and claimed she was denied medical care, according to details of the agreement obtained by The Associated Press on Saturday. Attorney General William Tong's office provided the AP with a copy of the settlement with Tianna Laboy, who said she complained about severe abdominal pain and bloody discharge in the hours leading up to the birth in 2018 but was told medical staff weren't available. The settlement was announced last month but the details were not disclosed until now. Under the agreement, about $83,000 will be subtracted from the $250,000 to pay for attorney fees, said Kenneth Krayeske, one of Laboy’s lawyers. Two-thirds of the remainder, about $112,000, will go into a trust for Laboy’s daughter and one-third, about $55,000, will go into a trust for Laboy, 23, who is serving a seven-year sentence at the state women’s prison for the non-fatal stabbing of a male companion in New Britain in 2017. The deal does not include any of the reforms Laboy sought, including required medical training for employees that would improve conditions at the York Correctional Institution women's prison in Niantic. Krayeske said the settlement is the best option for Laboy's family at this time, and she likely will file more litigation over the conditions of her confinement. “It's only money,” Krayeske said Saturday. “It doesn’t deal with the conditions of her confinement and it doesn’t deal with some of the larger issues. We didn’t get any injunctive relief or promises from the state that this doesn’t happen again.” Elizabeth Benton, a spokeswoman for Tong, said in a...

“It was not working well for us at the moment but it can work well in the future. We have a plan b and plan c. We came back to a 4-3-3. It helped us to get more offensive. I am very happy. As a coach and players, we have to take pressure and we can take the criticisms. To answer every conference about set- pieces is very funny.
