Bloomberg) -- Palantir Technologies Inc., the Silicon Valley data company backed by Peter Thiel, raised 54 billion yen ($500 million) from Japan’s Sompo Japan Nipponkoa Holdings Inc. in what’s set to be one of the last investments before the stock is traded publicly.
 The cash lessens the need for Palantir to raise capital through an initial public offering. The company has been considering a direct listing of its shares on an exchange as an option, which would allow Palantir to bypass a roadshow and other formalities of an IPO, though it would not bring in new funds, people familiar with the matter have said.
 The decision on how and when to go public ultimately rests with Palantir’s board, which is led by Thiel. The company is preparing to confidentially file paperwork with U.S. regulators for the stock to begin trading in the fall, Bloomberg reported last week. Those plans could change, though.
 Founded in 2003, Palantir sells software to government agencies and companies for managing and analyzing their data. The Palo Alto, California-based company has faced criticism for working with U.S. immigration officials and police agencies accused of using the tools to discriminate and surveil. Palantir has also won some accolades for helping the U.S. military find terrorists and aiding companies like Merck KGaA in the search for new drugs.
 Last year, Palantir and the insurance company Sompo established a Japanese joint venture, each with a 50% stake. Japan’s Fujitsu Ltd. said last week it was investing $50 million in the U.S. company. Palantir told investors earlier this year it expects to break even globally on $1 billion in revenue in 2020.

Ruling in favor of the joinder, the judge adjourned the case until October 8, 2019, another month behind bars for Mr. Chouta. At the hearing on October 8, 2019, the judge stated that the court could not proceed with the case because of an interlocutory appeal filed by the joined defendant. This appeal hearing was scheduled for March 9, 2020, meaning that Mr. Chouta was left to languish in prison for another six months. Subsequently, the March 9 proceedings were postponed for a month after Ms. Beyala's lawyer requested additional time to secure her presence. Arguments were heard on April 13, and the ruling delivered on April 27. The court dismissed the appeal and ordered the resumption of the criminal trial. On June 10, 2020, proceedings reopened at the trial court. The authorities, however, were delayed in transporting Mr. Chouta to the hearing, and his co-accused were absent, having not been properly summoned. As a result, the trial was adjourned to June 24, 2020.

Did the wide-ranging fallout of the 2013 IPL spot-fixing scandal work as a deterrent against corruption in Indian cricket? Not so, say anti-corruption (ACU) officials in the sport.
 These officials say the corruptors now look to target the state leagues as well as lesser known live competitions - smaller in scale and involving more vulnerable players. "We have 50 investigations that we are undertaking and majority have links to corruptors in India," Steve Richardson, coordinator of investigations, International Cricket Council ACU said in a webinar on Sports Law and Policy on Saturday.
 Of late, no high-profile Indian cricketer may have come under the lens, but the player-bookie nexus goes unabated, he said. "Players are the final link in the chain. Problem is with people who organise corruption, who pay the players; who sit outside the sport. I can deliver eight names to Indian governing agencies who are serial offenders and constantly approach the players," Richardson added.
 But for Covid 19 applying the brake on all state leagues, many of them would have been on by now. The Karnataka Premier League (KPL) remains suspended and police investigations are on after some players and a team owner were charged with fixing. "The police has filed partial charge-sheets in KPL matter. We are in the process of examination of that evidence," BCCI ACU head Ajit Singh said.
   
   
 "The entire malice emanates from (illegal) betting. Just to make windfall gains illegally through betting, they approach participants (players, support staff, officials, franchise owners) and the amount of money involved is unimaginable - an annual turnover of R30,000-40,000 crore; including sports and other activities. In state leagues, we got betting examined on certain matches and we discovered it comes to the tune of more than 2 million pounds per match," said Singh.
 ACU officials say nothing will change until match-fixing is made a criminal offence in India. "Sri Lanka was the first nation that brought a match-fixing law. For that reason, Sri Lanka cricket is better protected now. In Australia's case, we are very proactive. At the moment, with no legislation in place in India, they are operating with one hand tied up," said Richardson.
 A robust law would also help protect ICC events better. "In Australia, they can stop someone coming to their country before the tournament. India too has ICC events coming up with the T20 World Cup (2021) and the 2023 ODI World Cup. Legislation would be a game changer."
 Singh said there would be a strong deterrent if the pending Prevention of Sports Fraud bill became law. "Fans put in a huge amount of emotion and this (fixing) happens… It starts at an early stage; those who are in sports betting nurture these players and start using them later for fixing. It needs to be curbed. For that you need a strong law. Currently it is archaic, and some of the conditions are laughable."

Thanks to two meetings in the SEC Championship Game and one more in the College Football Playoff National Championship Game, Alabama and Georgia will be playing their sixth game against one another in the past 12 seasons when they meet on Sept. 19, an anomaly for two teams in different divisions of the SEC.
   
 Alabama won all five. Another win in 2020 would tie UA with its longest winning streak against the Bulldogs in program history.
   
 The countdown to kickoff starts with the USC game on Sept. 5, but UA won't have to wait long after that for its first (and possibly most difficult) test of its SEC regular season schedule: hosting Georgia two weeks later. That game will be the 70th playing between the schools in a series that started in 1895.
   
 UA and Georgia have been members of the same conference dating all the way back to 1895, when both were members of the now defunct Southern intercollegiate Athletic Association, before a stint in the Southern Conference from 1922-1932. The two schools have never gone more than seven seasons without a game between them.
   
 By the time the two moved to become founding members of the SEC for the 1933 football season, they had played each other in Montgomery, Birmingham, Tuscaloosa, Atlanta and Columbus, Georgia, but never in Athens, Georgia. They played every year from 1922 to 1934 and all of them in the state of Alabama, the first two in Montgomery and the final eight in Birmingham. It wasn't until 1935 that the two would meet in Athens.
   
 Georgia's best stretch in the series was the 1910s, when the Bulldogs won five of the six games, the five wins coming consecutively with a combined final score of 69-12. That streak remains Georgia's best; since then, the Bulldogs have only exceeded two straight wins against UA once, a three-game streak from 2002-2007.
   
 Since the end of that five-game streak by Georgia in the 1910s, UA has gone 37-18-1 against the Bulldogs, including the active five-game winning streak, other five-game streaks from 1922-1926 and 1960-1964 and the record six-game streak from 1949-1954. Included in the most recent streak are both of the meetings in the SEC Championship Game, won by eerily similar scores of 32-28 in 2012 and 35-28 in 2018.
   
 It has been 12 years since the schools played in Bryant-Denny Stadium, but the recent history of the two playing in Tuscaloosa features thrilling games. Each of the last three games in Tuscaloosa were decided by one possession, most recently a 26-23 game in overtime won on a touchdown pass from Matthew Stafford.
   
 In 2002, with Brodie Croyle starting at quarterback for an injured Tyler Watts, Alabama used a fourth-quarter pick-6 from Charlie Peprah to take the lead, just to lose on a game-winning field goal from Billy Bennett. Michael Proctor was the hero in 1994, making a game-winning field goal after Jay Barker threw for 394 yards and two touchdowns.

England's strength and conditioning coach Rob Ahmun feels the coronavirus- forced break has "without a shadow of doubt" prolonged pace spearhead James Anderson's career by a year or two.
 Anderson is among a group of 55 players asked to return to England training ahead of the three-match Test series against West Indies, scheduled to begin on July 8. The 37-year-old has been bowling in the nets while following social-distancing norms.
 Ahmun has been monitoring Anderson's performance since he resumed training post the COVID-19 hiatus.
 "I've been in pretty close contact with Jimmy all the way through this. Even from the calf injury last year he's actually improved his physical capacities all across the board, which for a 37-year-old international bowler to do is fantastic," Ahmun told 'Sky Sports'.
   
   
 "Again, it's just testament to the level of preparation and hard work that he actually puts into his physical training. He understands that if he doesn't do that, that he'll probably not get onto the park. So for him the physical stuff is a vital part of his day-to-day match preparation," he added.
 England's all-time leading wicket-taker Anderson has struggled with injuries over the past year. He injured his calf during the first Ashes Test against Australia and most recently he was forced to leave the team's tour of South Africa in January owing to a rib problem.
 "We took a lot of learnings away from the James Anderson experience last year, to be honest, and part of that was the competitive cricket that the players need to be exposed to before they go back to performing on the highest stage," Ahmun said.
 "This is why we've got this big squad, so there will be an inter-squad match just to make sure that these lads are prepped as much as possible. We've also tried to engineer the training sessions so that our best bowlers are bowling at our best batters as well," he added.
 The series against Pakistan will mark the resumption of the international cricket which has been suspended since March due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The two sides will play in a 'bio-secure venues'.

Hoteliers in Goa are annoyed with the state government for not allowing businesses to restart almost a fortnight after the Central government's green light to resume operations under the Unlock 1 guidelines.The Travel and Tourism Association of Goa has pointed out that despite applying for permission as sought by the state government, none have been permitted to resume business. "The 8th of June has been the date on which all the hotels and restaurants were required to open. Many hotels situated in bigger cities in India have already started to operate for business. It is almost 13 days and the industry is waiting for an OK from the Government to start operating all these units," Nilesh Shah, the president of the Travel and Tourism Association of Goa, said. The Goa Tourism Department had called for hoteliers to submit applications to reopen as well as an undertaking that they will follow all the guidelines and standard operating procedures as mandated by the Union Ministry of Home Affairs. Hoteliers had started submitting applications from June 8.Earlier, Director of Tourism Menino D'Souza had said that the Department would then inspect each hotel to ensure compliances before allowing them to restart. "All hotels which are willing to comply with the guidelines, have to apply to the department. We will verify whether they are in a position to comply with the guidelines," D'Souza had said. The TTAG has however, claimed that despite more than 200 hotels applying to reopen, none have been given the go ahead to do so. "Out of thousands of hotels waiting to reopen we have only about 200 who have applied for permission to reopen. Up to now there has been no go ahead given by our state Government to reopen," Shah added. Tourism, which is a major revenue earner in Goa, has come to a complete standstill following the lockdown to control the Covid-19 pandemic. The TTAG has claimed that the direct and indirect economic impact of the tourism industry is estimated at 40% of the state's GDP.The industry has also sought that bars and restaurants also be allowed to reopen in the state as hotels "cannot successfully (reopen) unless the bars and restaurants are given permissions to reopen as well."Restaurants have been allowed to reopen in the state with only half the capacity but aren't allowed to serve alcohol.

Did the wide-ranging fallout of the 2013 IPL spot-fixing scandal work as a deterrent against corruption in Indian cricket? Not so, say anti-corruption (ACU) officials in the sport.These officials say the corruptors now look to target the state leagues as well as lesser known live competitions - smaller in scale and involving more vulnerable players. "We have 50 investigations that we are undertaking and majority have links to corruptors in India," Steve Richardson, coordinator of investigations, International Cricket Council ACU said in a webinar on Sports Law and Policy on Saturday.Of late, no high-profile Indian cricketer may have come under the lens, but the player-bookie nexus goes unabated, he said. "Players are the final link in the chain. Problem is with people who organise corruption, who pay the players; who sit outside the sport. I can deliver eight names to Indian governing agencies who are serial offenders and constantly approach the players," Richardson added.But for Covid 19 applying the brake on all state leagues, many of them would have been on by now. The Karnataka Premier League (KPL) remains suspended and police investigations are on after some players and a team owner were charged with fixing. "The police has filed partial charge-sheets in KPL matter. We are in the process of examination of that evidence," BCCI ACU head Ajit Singh said."The entire malice emanates from (illegal) betting. Just to make windfall gains illegally through betting, they approach participants (players, support staff, officials, franchise owners) and the amount of money involved is unimaginable - an annual turnover of R30,000-40,000 crore; including sports and other activities. In state leagues, we got betting examined on certain matches and we discovered it comes to the tune of more than 2 million pounds per match," said Singh.ACU officials say nothing will change until match-fixing is made a criminal offence in India. "Sri Lanka was the first nation that brought a match-fixing law. For that reason, Sri Lanka cricket is better protected now. In Australia's case, we are very proactive. At the moment, with no legislation in place in India, they are operating with one hand tied up," said Richardson.A robust law would also help protect ICC events better. "In Australia, they can stop someone coming to their country before the tournament. India too has ICC events coming up with the T20 World Cup (2021) and the 2023 ODI World Cup. Legislation would be a game changer."Singh said there would be a strong deterrent if the pending Prevention of Sports Fraud bill became law. "Fans put in a huge amount of emotion and this (fixing) happens… It starts at an early stage; those who are in sports betting nurture these players and start using them later for fixing. It needs to be curbed. For that you need a strong law. Currently it is archaic, and some of the conditions are laughable."

England's strength and conditioning coach Rob Ahmun feels the coronavirus-forced break has "without a shadow of doubt" prolonged pace spearhead James Anderson's career by a year or two.Anderson is among a group of 55 players asked to return to England training ahead of the three-match Test series against West Indies, scheduled to begin on July 8. The 37-year-old has been bowling in the nets while following social-distancing norms.Ahmun has been monitoring Anderson's performance since he resumed training post the COVID-19 hiatus."I've been in pretty close contact with Jimmy all the way through this. Even from the calf injury last year he's actually improved his physical capacities all across the board, which for a 37-year-old international bowler to do is fantastic," Ahmun told 'Sky Sports'."Again, it's just testament to the level of preparation and hard work that he actually puts into his physical training. He understands that if he doesn't do that, that he'll probably not get onto the park. So for him the physical stuff is a vital part of his day-to-day match preparation," he added.England's all-time leading wicket-taker Anderson has struggled with injuries over the past year. He injured his calf during the first Ashes Test against Australia and most recently he was forced to leave the team's tour of South Africa in January owing to a rib problem."We took a lot of learnings away from the James Anderson experience last year, to be honest, and part of that was the competitive cricket that the players need to be exposed to before they go back to performing on the highest stage," Ahmun said."This is why we've got this big squad, so there will be an inter-squad match just to make sure that these lads are prepped as much as possible. We've also tried to engineer the training sessions so that our best bowlers are bowling at our best batters as well," he added.The series against Pakistan will mark the resumption of the international cricket which has been suspended since March due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The two sides will play in a 'bio-secure venues'.

A friend cautioned me last week not to write about the fires, looting and protesting that followed the death of George Floyd at the hands of a Minneapolis policeman on May 25. "You can't win," the friend said, with good reason.
 So I didn't. But. on second thought, maybe a few words this week.
 There are plenty of strange things that happened during that week, not the least of which were statements by veteran anchors and reporters that were quite critical of Mayor Jacob Frey and Gov. Tim Walz. Why weren't they doing anything, some asked. And then, when the National Guard, state troopers and other law enforcement personnel were called in to beef up the presence after a couple horrible nights of fires and looting, some of those same people asked if having such a large contingent of people trying to keep the peace was necessary. I couldn't figure that one out.
 And then there was Mayor Frey fanning the flames — oh, that's right, I wasn't going to go there. And Gov. Walz — oops, not going there either. And then police union chief Bob Kroll — I'll let that one go also, although it's hard to do.
 The biggest takeaway for me, other than the horrendous incident that precipitated the whole thing and cast the eyes of the world on Minnesota, was that many critics were willing to paint people on both sides — protesters and law enforcement — with too broad a brush.
 Painting with a broad brush is defined, at least by me, as lumping everyone of a particular group or occupation together.
 If you look it up in one of the sources available on the internet, it's defined as "to describe something in general terms without mentioning specific details and without paying attention to individual variations." There are other similar meanings available.
 And that's what happened.

This second path toward unity requires purification. This path seeks homogeneity in place of diversity, top-down standards in place of localism. Standards for membership are not weak or broad — membership cannot be obtained simply by avoiding encroaching on others’ life, liberty or property. Membership only can be obtained and maintained through strict compliance with an increasingly arcane set of rules and standards. Politically, this means a demanding legal regime with heavy coercion. Culturally, this means braying mobs of ideological enforcers, casting out unbelievers into the cornfields.
 This second model of governance is promoted by the political left today. In this view, diversity of viewpoint cannot be allowed; unity of viewpoint in all things is the predicate for all serious change. Once the group has been purified, change will require only the snap of a finger. No more gridlock; no more conversation. The collective can be activated quickly and powerfully.
 This second model of governance is totalitarian in nature, and it is toward that model we now are moving as a society. Politically, those who deny the collective ought to have the power to override individual rights must be punished; culturally, they must be exiled. They must be deemed unworthy. To stand up for individual rights in this climate means to be labeled a defender of privilege. To deny the systemic evil of the United States means to betray your moral unworthiness.
 The great irony is the second model of unity — the totalitarian purification rituals we watch before us — never will achieve unity. It will achieve further division, as more and more people fall short of ideological purity or refuse to bow before the ideological demands of the perpetual revolutionaries.
 We could agree to live with one another, as individuals under the broader rubric of rights. If we don’t, we won’t be living with one another at all.

Hoteliers in Goa are annoyed with the state government for not allowing businesses to restart almost a fortnight after the Central government's green light to resume operations under the Unlock 1 guidelines.
 The Travel and Tourism Association of Goa has pointed out that despite applying for permission as sought by the state government, none have been permitted to resume business.
 "The 8th of June has been the date on which all the hotels and restaurants were required to open. Many hotels situated in bigger cities in India have already started to operate for business. It is almost 13 days and the industry is waiting for an OK from the Government to start operating all these units," Nilesh Shah, the president of the Travel and Tourism Association of Goa, said.
 The Goa Tourism Department had called for hoteliers to submit applications to reopen as well as an undertaking that they will follow all the guidelines and standard operating procedures as mandated by the Union Ministry of Home Affairs. Hoteliers had started submitting applications from June 8.
   
   
 Earlier, Director of Tourism Menino D'Souza had said that the Department would then inspect each hotel to ensure compliances before allowing them to restart.
 "All hotels which are willing to comply with the guidelines, have to apply to the department. We will verify whether they are in a position to comply with the guidelines," D'Souza had said.
 The TTAG has however, claimed that despite more than 200 hotels applying to reopen, none have been given the go ahead to do so.
 "Out of thousands of hotels waiting to reopen we have only about 200 who have applied for permission to reopen. Up to now there has been no go ahead given by our state Government to reopen," Shah added.
 Tourism, which is a major revenue earner in Goa, has come to a complete standstill following the lockdown to control the Covid-19 pandemic. The TTAG has claimed that the direct and indirect economic impact of the tourism industry is estimated at 40% of the state's GDP.
 The industry has also sought that bars and restaurants also be allowed to reopen in the state as hotels "cannot successfully (reopen) unless the bars and restaurants are given permissions to reopen as well."
 Restaurants have been allowed to reopen in the state with only half the capacity but aren't allowed to serve alcohol.

Bloomberg) -- Over the course of almost a decade, Airbus SE supplier UMI Aeronautica SL pivoted from military to commercial aircraft, making parts including door components for the A320 and A330, among the most popular jets in the sky.
 Defense orders were languishing, while commercial aviation enjoyed a prolonged boom, so shifting more than two thirds of output made sense.
 Now the Spanish company and its about 300 employees are caught up in the worst crisis the aviation industry has ever known, striking hardest where UMI built its expertise: passenger aircraft that are now sitting idle as the coronavirus grounds global fleets.
 “About 35% of our staff have been idled, as we had a corresponding drop in our workload” said Co-Chief Executive Officer Antonio Ramirez in an interview. “But that’s only the beginning, because the situation is expected to get even worse.”
 UMI’s troubles reflect the fate of the bigger aerospace cluster that southern Spain has carved out over the years. Rising from the vast fields of orange- and olive-tree groves near Seville is the Aerópolis business park that was created in 2003 and is now home to more than 85 companies catering to Airbus, Boeing Co. and other manufacturers. As planemakers cuts jobs and production, the effects are rippling through the region of Andalusia, where the number of unemployed is already Spain’s highest.
 Cuts Coming?
 Airbus has furloughed more than 3,000 workers in Spain due to the impact of Covid-19, and the company’s chief Guillaume Faury is expected to make a decision on permanent job cuts by July. About fourth-fifths of the 2.5 billion ($2.8 billion) in revenue generated by the Andalusian suppliers come from the European planemaker, which employs 6,000 workers in the region and has seven factories in the country, including the final assembly line for the A400M military transport.
 Military programs like the Airbus A400M were until recently UMI’s main business, but in the last two years its output “practically halved,” prompting a strategic shift, Ramirez said. With air passenger demand not recovering any time soon, suppliers in the region are now trying to revert back to military production, effectively flipping the business logic many had adopted prior to the crisis, said Ramirez, who is also vice-president of the Fedeme Andalusian Federation of metal companies.
 Ramirez said the A350 and the A330 wide-body models are the hardest-hit programs, along with the Boeing 737 Max, a model that was already struggling before the pandemic because of two deadly crashes in rapid succession.
 For the Andalusian suppliers, that has meant idling almost half of their 16,000 workers. They have so far sought to protect liquidity through state- backed credit lines and made use of the national temporary layoff program, known as ERTE. Should the crisis persist, the workload of regional suppliers -- mostly metallic parts makers and engineering firms -- could drop as much as 50% in coming years, Ramirez estimates.
 Potential consolidation
 In order to mitigate the impact of the pandemic, some companies are laying the groundwork for future consolidation, said Juan Roman, managing director of Andalucia Aerospace, a cluster of about 130 aeronautical companies in the region. Possible suitors also include Spanish and international venture- capital funds, he said.
 “Our companies must gain size through alliances and even M&A to be more competitive in the future,” Roman said.
 Pulling together won’t necessarily be easy, said Jose Luis Galan, a professor who studies corporate organizations at the University of Seville. Previous attempts in the 1980s failed because many of the smaller companies were protective of their own expertise and resisted bonding together, he said. But given the scale of the crisis, this time round may be different.
 “They may have no choice anyway,” Galan said. “With such a big shock, many of them are going to disappear.”
 One conclusion from the crisis is that being so closely linked to Airbus’s fortunes carries risk. A new maintenance facility by Irish discount airline Ryanair Holdings Plc in Seville is one example of the region trying to attract other businesses. It’s a plan supported by the Andalusian government and centered around boosting the use of new materials for zero-emission aircrafts, as well as new technologies such as the 5G wireless standard and artificial intelligence.
 “The Andalusian aerospace ecosystem is attractive enough to open new market niches and receive direct investments, not only to work as a plane-makers supplier,” Rogelio Velasco, head of the regional economy and business department, wrote in emailed answers to questions.
