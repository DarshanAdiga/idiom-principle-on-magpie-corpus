Most people who buy or lease new cars change them every 2 or 3 years. Plenty of people buy 2 or 3 year old cars & run them for another 2 or 3 years. Indications are that the Tesla batteries will be at about 75% capacity at 10 years/200,000 miles and 50% capacity at 15 years/300,000 miles. They are expensive to buy new & exist mainly in the executive car market, along side high end BMWs, Mercs, Jags, etc., and partly as an amazing electronic gadget. They may not have the executive finish people are used to in German cars, being plain & uncluttered, but they are fabulous to drive, wickedly fast off the line, silently relaxing and can more or less drive themselves long distance (especially with the latest v9 over-the-air software enhancements), as well as costing next to nothing to run. The majority of owners charge them at home overnight on cheap rate electricity, while Superchargers are for travelling over the 250-300 mile range in a day. Bear in mind that these cars are replacing fossil Jags & Range Rovers which normally only manage 25mpg on a good day, so there are massive savings if you regularly travel long distance. Why not visit your local Tesla centre & take a test drive? The danger is that you may then need to sell your house to feed your habit!

Abed condemned US President Donald Trump's plan for Mideast peace, also known as the "Deal of the Century," as a scheme designed to "liquidate the Palestinian cause and national rights."            He called on the Palestinian leadership to terminate all the signed agreements with Israel, withdraw PLO recognition of Israel, and halt security coordination between the Palestinian security services and the IDF.            Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on Wednesday received a phone call from the chairman of Iran's Islamic Consultative Assembly, Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, who informed him of Tehran's rejection of the "Deal of the Century" and the annexation plan, Hamas said in a statement. "The Iranian official expressed his country's readiness to support the steadfastness of the Palestinian people in confronting and thwarting the annexation plan," the statement said. Haniyeh, for his part, told Ghalibaf that the Palestinians are determined to foil the Israeli plan.            Ismail Radwan, a senior Hamas official in the Gaza Strip, said that Palestinian unity was the best response to the annexation plan and the Trump deal. "Today, all Palestinians took to the streets to tell the occupation that despite the division [between the West Bank and Gaza Strip], and despite the crimes, we are united in confronting the Deal of the Century and foiling the annexation plan," Radwan said. "All options are on the table, including the popular and armed resistance, to thwart the plan."            Palestinian Islamic Jihad official Khaled al-Batsh also threatned that the Palestinians would resort to "armed resistance" to foil the annexation plan.            Ahmed Hils, a senior Fatah official who participated in the protest, said that Palestinians from across the political spectrum were united in rejecting the annexation plan by "the Israeli enemy."            In the West Bank, the PA announced a five-day lockdown on Nablus, Bethlehem and Hebron as part of efforts to curb the spread of the coronavirus. The decision came after PA Health Minister Mai al-Kaila announced that 280 new confirmed cases of coronavirus have been detected in the West Bank in the past 24 hours, raising the number of Palestinians infected with the disease to 3,045.            Kaila said that most of the cases - 199 - were discovered in the Hebron area, 47 in the Bethlehem area, 17 in the Nablus area, three in Jericho, four in Tulkarem and 10 in Ramallah and El-Bireh. Eleven Palestinians have died from the virus since the beginning of March.            "Palestinians in the West Bank are more concerned about the coronavirus than the annexation plan," said Palestinian political analyst Maher al-Sha'er. "That's why we didn't see major events in the West Bank in protest of the annexation. In the Gaza Strip, the situation is different because the number of confirmed coronavirus cases is very low."             A PA official in Ramallah confirmed that the Palestinian leadership had received "assurances" from several parties that, contrary to expectations, the Israeli government would not announce the annexation plan on Wednesday. "We received indirect messages from Israel that nothing will happen on Wednesday," the official said. "But that does not mean that Israel has completely abandoned its annexation plan."            Other officials claimed that the massive Palestinian diplomatic campaign in the past few weeks, as well as Abbas's decision to renounce agreements with Israel and halt the security coordination with the IDF, had "forced" Israel to "reconsider" its plan.            PLO Secretary-General Saeb Erekat, however, warned that the postponement of the annexation announcement, which was expected on Wednesday, was part of Israeli and American "tactics and tricks."            Erekat said that the Palestinian leadership was pursuing its efforts to rally the international community against the plan, adding that 192 countries have expressed opposition to it. "Annexation is a war crime, according to international treaties," he said. "We won't sit at the negotiating table [with Israel] where the annexation plan or the Trump plan are proposed."                 *[FT]: Financial Times

COVID-19 has truly turned life as we know it upside down, but I believe it has made us better in so many ways – especially when it comes to quality and patient safety. It has challenged us to be innovative, to think outside the box and to quickly adapt to change – all things necessary to successfully navigate our “new normal.” Because the reality we face is that, until there is a vaccine, we can expect that COVID-19 is here to stay. It’s something that we must learn to live with and do our best to protect against. Since it isn’t going away, I hope you have every confidence that your hometown hospital is continuing to take every possible precaution to help protect you when you come for care. We want you to feel comfortable coming to see us and not ignore any health concerns you may have in hopes the pandemic will end soon.

Ever since I saw _The Exorcist_ in a theater, I've dreaded such dark manipulation, though I've now come to terms with the benefits of green pea soup.

What worried me even more was that this was an ad for an e-bike and the official body was French. Yes, one of America's closest allies and the place where laissez-faire originated.            This ad, you see, presented the VanMoof S3 e-bike as a contrast to the world of the high-falutin', pollutin' fancy cars. Well, all cars really.
