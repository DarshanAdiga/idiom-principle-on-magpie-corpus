Is a second stimulus check still coming in 2020? Talks meant to finalize a new stimulus bill have been deadlocked for weeks, but another direct payment isn't out of the question. Both chambers of Congress and the White House favor sending another round of stimulus money to people who meet the qualifications.
 If a stimulus payment is authorized (either by bill or possible executive action using money allocated to emergency pandemic programs), Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has stated the checks could go out within a week.
 Depending on how everything proceeds in Washington over the next few weeks, we can get an idea of when payments could go out and who could be first in line for another payment. CNET's stimulus check calculator can also help you estimate how much money you could expect to see. This story was recently updated.

Many states offer ways for voters to verify the status of their ballot online that provide information on when an absentee ballot request has been received, when a ballot has been sent, when the ballot has been received by a local election office and whether it has passed the security review and been accepted. These are typically available on the website of the state election board or the secretary of state.

In August there were 4.7 million fewer jobs than there were when Trump was inaugurated in January 2017. But if he leaves office in five months, and if the economy adds more than 1 million jobs each month, as happened in July and August, he could end up in the black. There are signs, though, that the gains are slowing as businesses have recalled many of the workers who were temporarily laid off from restaurants, bars, retailers and other businesses. So Biden’s prediction could come true.

ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — Jack Little has seen a lot of friends in the restaurant industry endure tough times during the pandemic. He figures a $500 tip can give some waiters and waitresses a boost, so he is accepting money from friends for big tips through the nationwide Venmo Challenge. He says he has raised nearly $7,000 that he doles out to whoever waits on him when he goes out to eat. Angelina Backus, one of the recipients, says her tip came at just the right time as she was struggling to make ends meet. The National Restaurant Association says the industry has lost millions of jobs.


--DocBreak--
Backus said the $500 tip from Little came as she was struggling to make ends meet. "It didn't go to anything exciting, unfortunately, but debt. Bills, rent, things like that," she said. "I was like, 'thank you, universe' when it happened because it was just amazing."

Shruti agrees but believes Indian mythology is what will intrigue the audience more because it has still not been used in a game of this level. "I think at the end of the day if the story is convincing and players can connect to the character itself then the gender does not matter. There are games before us that have had a strong female protagonist, believable characters and people love it," she says, adding that she does not know whether Raji will attract more gamers or not.

Two White Township-based entrepreneurs hope the day comes when their mail- order business can handle all sorts of prescriptions, for such ailments as high blood pressure and cholesterol levels that are out of whack.
 For now, Lou Scerbo and Ryan Lombardi are entering the online telepharmacy business with an initial focus on one sort of treatment — for erectile dysfunction.
 “I was going to develop an online prescription site and eventual telemedicine site,” Scerbo said. “The easiest entrance is through ED medication, because of the privacy issues and the ego issues that males have to deal with.”
 Scerbo, a pharmacist in Clymer, has owned the domain “MyEDmeds.com” for three years. He needed someone who understood social media and how the Internet works, and last year he met Lombardi.
 Lombardi, a 2014 Indiana University of Pennsylvania graduate from Johnstown, runs MuscleMan Media, an agency whose purpose is to “use the power of the Internet” to help clients reach customers they once were missing.
 The idea is to provide a site where a man could have a doctor visit, get a prescription for sildenafil (the generic name for Viagra) or tadalafil (the generic name for Cialis), and have it shipped to him, all in about one hour.
 “Our (myedmeds.com) site is live in Pennsylvania and Florida,” Scerbo said. “As of next week we plan to add teleconference and telescheduling. We’re hoping to have everything in place by Jan. 1.”
 It’s one type of medical treatment, for now, but as Lombardi said, “there’s been a lot of intricate detail” to go into that.
 “We’ve been beta testing up until now,” Lombardi said from an office near the IndianaCountyJimmyStewartAirport.
 "An online doctor visit is $20 (less than most co-pays)," according to the MyEDmeds.com website, "plus the cost of your medication (if prescribed). You can pay through our secure platform using a credit or debit card."
 And you can talk to that physician.
 “After completing a brief online questionnaire, a physician will review your responses and if additional information is needed, you will be contacted,” the website said. “You may contact the physician at any time via chat within our patient portal.”
 And, the website stressed, “our top priority is the security and privacy of your information.”
 As Scerbo noted, “we are required by law to be HIPAA-compliant,” referring to the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.
 There’s a lot of Indiana involvement. InnovaScript, a mail-order subsidiary of Diamond Pharmacy Services, is contracted as prescription fulfillment company for Scerbo and Lombardi’s venture.
 “We hope to make them so busy they have to hire people,” Scerbo said.
