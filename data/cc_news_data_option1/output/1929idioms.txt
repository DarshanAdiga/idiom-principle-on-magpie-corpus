 Champions Bayern Munich scored a goal late in each half to beat promoted Union Berlin 2-0 on their return to the Bundesliga on Sunday after more than two months out due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and protect their four-point lead at the top. League top scorer Robert Lewandowski converted a 40th minute spot kick and Benjamin Pavard headed in a corner in the 80th in an empty stadium, to keep the Bavarians in the driving seat for a record- extending eighth successive league title. They are now on 58 points, with Borussia Dortmund in second place on 54 following their 4-0 demolition of Schalke 04 on Saturday. There are eight matchdays left in the season. We were there from the start even though it may not have been our best performance today, said Bayer captain Manuel Neuer, who has now kept a clean sheet at least once against all 35 Bundesliga clubs he has played against. We are happy to have controlled the game and to have brought the three points home. In games without fans the minutes are very long until the final whistle. The Bundesliga is the first major sports league in the world to restart amid the pandemic but games are played without fans. A set of strict health regulations are governing the matches, including a ban on spectators, limited staff inside and outside the stadium and regular testing. The empty slabs of the concrete stands in the Alte Foersterei stadium with a few dozen officials, staff and substitutes scattered around were an unusual setting for a return to action of Germany`s most successful club. But Bayern quickly took control and had an early effort ruled offside. Union were without coach Urs Fischer, who was missing for private reasons. The visitors had to wait until the 40th minute to score with Lewandowski, chasing Gerd Mueller`s legendary 40-league goal record from 1972, grabbing his 26th of the campaign from the spot. The game lost some of its pace after the break with the players lacking match practice. Pavard made sure of the three points when he headed in a Joshua Kimmich corner. Berlin police had warned fans, as in all stadiums, to stay away but said a few dozen had gathered outside the stadium prior to the game. They left following talks with police, who had a force of 400 around the stadium. The German Football League is desperate to avoid any rule violation that could threaten the league restart as it hopes to finish the season by June 30 for contractual reasons.

Bea Markow just turned 100 on May 4, and she has seen a lot in her life, but nothing quite like the coronavirus pandemic.
   
 She doesn't recall anything in her 100 years being "so overall terrible."
   
 "I've never seen anything like it -- it's just ridiculous," she said. "I've never heard of anything like this ... it's really a very, very serious situation ... it's just very, very frightening."
   
 The pandemic prompted the cancellation of her 100th birthday party, which was scheduled for early May. In lieu of a party, the Phoenix Fire Department and several community members organized a surprise appearance as Markow watched from her balcony. It was a feel-good event that was covered by several local news outlets.
   
 It's all right that the party had to be changed, she said, because it's too "risky" to not follow recommendations like wearing a mask or practicing social distancing.
   
 "It's important that we just follow every rule that we have to try to get this period over with -- I hope I live to see that day."
   
 Markow said she's hardly left her room since the outbreak began, and that the only in-person communication she has is with her "wonderful" caregiver.
   
 She said she hasn't been lonely, though, adding that as of May 12 she was still reading the more than 100 birthday cards that she received.
   
 Reading those cards reminded her of why she believes she's been able to live so long.
   
 "They say, 'you are nice to people, you understand people, you always try to help,'" she said. "I think if people enjoyed themselves more, were happier, they would be a lot better off."
   
 She's also kept herself "very, very busy" with phone calls from loved ones.
   
 "I'm very fortunate -- I have a lot of friends," she said.
   
 She does miss the simple things, though. Markow told The Republic she looks forward to going downstairs and joining her fellow residents for dinner.
   
 Bea Markow,born in 1920, was the third child and first girl in a Russian- Jewish household in a Brooklyn tenement.
   
 She was a "cherished" child who was the valedictorian of her high school class, her 72-year-old daughter Gayle Markow said.
   
 Bea remembers the Great Depression as a "difficult time," though she said it was then that she secured her first job, a $12-per-week stint with a small publishing company.
   
 After five years, she got a job with Superman comics where she answered fan letters as Lois Lane for $25 per week.
   
 She met her graphic artist husband, Bob Markow, while at a Phoenix convention and ultimately moved to the city and married him in 1943.
   
 Bob went into the military and eventually became the base photographer at Thunderbird Field No. 1 in Glendale.
   
 After his service, the couple went into business together with Markow Photography. They also started Colormark Custom Photo Lab, which The East Valley Tribune reported was the Valley's first custom photo lab, and Markow photo supply stores.
   
 Though Bob Markow was the face of the business, Gayle Markow said her mother was tireless in her behind-the-scenes work to support their ventures.
   
 "She was self-effacing in public but she was a powerhouse," Gayle said. "She was always a powerhouse in anything she did."
   
 Bob died in 2009, and Gayle Markow recalls her mother refusing to leave the home they shared for the first year afterward.
   
 Eventually, she moved into The Palazzo assisted living facility in Phoenix, where Gayle Markow said her mother flourished and quickly made new friends.
   
 Gayle Markow and her sister had been planning a large celebration with over 100 guests, an event that was canceled once the pandemic hit.
   
 Though Bea Markow said she was "disappointed" that she couldn't physically be with all of her children on her special day, she said she wouldn't have wanted them to take risks with their health by traveling for the occasion.
   
 She still had a spectacular birthday, though.
   
 News outlets, including The Republic, wrote about Markow's 100th birthday on May 4 that included a visit from the Phoenix Fire Department and a slew of masked people waving to her from the street below.
   
 Markow said her son even made an appearance on the fireman's ladder, which added to how "overwhelmed" she felt.
   
 "I can't describe it -- it was just too much," she said. "It was just so wonderful to see and so out of the question ... it's really something that happens once in a lifetime."
   
 Markow said if she could offer one message to those younger than her, it would be one of self-care.
   
 "It pays to take care of yourself," she said. "You have one life to live. Take care of yourself and be good to yourself."

On March 7, the General Assembly passed the Virginia Clean Economy Act, which goes into effect July 1. The new law, which narrowly passed the Senate by four votes (22-18) and the House by eight (53-45), requires the commonwealth‚Äôs electric utilities to begin transitioning to 100% fossil-free energy sources by 2050.
 Legislators touted the environmental benefits of the bill, but didn‚Äôt mention the costs.
 The same day the law was passed, the Virginia Department of Health had just reported the first known case of confirmed coronavirus in the commonwealth: a Marine at Fort Belvoir who had recently returned from overseas. The state economy was then still in full swing, with low unemployment numbers and a rosy revenue forecast.

The former Arizona teacher who pleaded guilty to carrying on an illicit sexual relationship with her 13-year-old student is expected to be sentenced to prison Friday.
   
 The sentencing will mark the end of the sensational case of 28-year-old Brittany Zamora. The former Las Brisas Academy elementary teacher has drawn international attention since she was arrested more than a year ago for molesting her barely teenage student.
   
 Previously released recordings of police interviews provided a glimpse into Zamora's monthslong abuse of her student, including allegations that she had sex with the boy multiple times in her car and classroom -- once with another male student in the room. The two even sexually touched each other while oblivious students watched a video, records show.
   
 But the full police report, which was recently reviewed by The Arizona Republic, provided a closer look at Zamora's predatory behavior and how she may have been grooming other students.
      
 The "relationship" between Zamora and the victim carried on for at least three months before a monitoring app on the boy's cellphone alerted his parents to illicit texts between the two.
   
 One of the parents of the victim recounted to police investigators how Zamora tried to maintain a sense of control over his life.
   
 "(Victim) said he was talking to a girl he liked and he told his friend about it," police wrote in the report. "Somehow Brittany found out that (victim) liked this girl and told him that he couldn't talk to this girl. Brittany also said that, if he dated the girl, she would get other girls to beat her up."
   
 Students noticed the strange relationship between their teacher and the victim months before Zamora was arrested.
   
 They thought they were too close, the report said. Rumors circulated that they were dating and that he had gotten her pregnant.
   
 It's not clear whether any other students saw the sexual activities that occurred during class.
   
 Principal Timothy Dickey interviewed a few of the students in light of the rumors and his notes from those conversations were included in the police report. The students complained that the boy received straight A's without actually doing the work and didn't receive the same punishments as other students.
   
 Another student said Zamora was too close to the kids in their class. The student pointed to Zamora attending another student's singing competition and football games outside of school. She frequently communicated with students outside of school through an Instagram account and an online instruction app called Classcraft.
   
 One female student even confronted Zamora on Classcraft about special treatment she believed Zamora was giving the victim, according to screenshots of the conversation included in the police report.
   
 Dickey later lectured the students about the dangers of rumors, according to a civil lawsuit filed by the parents of the victim against Zamora's husband and the Liberty Elementary School District.
   
 Zamora reassured Dickey that it was the victim who gravitated toward her, the report said. She didn't know how to address the matter without hurting his feelings. The boy was hyperactive and could be disruptive, she told Dickey. He would sit at her desk so she could give him a task to keep him occupied and prevent him from distracting everyone else.
   
 Zamora told Dickey he could check Classcraft to view the communications. He never did.
   
 Police interviews show Zamora may have been grooming another potential victim.
   
 The mother of a male friend of the victim told police Zamora promised to send her son naked pictures over the summer.
   
 During class, Zamora asked the friend whether he was circumcised, the report said. She showed him pictures of male genitalia on her phone when he said he didn't understand the question.
   
 The conversation stopped when it was time for recess.
   
 The friend told police Zamora never tried to touch or kiss him. His parents declined to prosecute.
   
 The victim's mother noticed her son had been acting differently. She later told police he suddenly wanted to shut his door at night and began showing more interest in girls.
   
 A cell phone monitoring app -- Sentry Parental Control -- alerted the mom March 21 the word "baby" was repeatedly coming up in a direct message conversation on Instagram.
   
 She quickly realized the Instagram account belonged to Zamora.
   
 The boy admitted to his parents that it was his teacher and they had had sex.
   
 It's not clear what caused Zamora to call the parents after she admitted to her husband she had been messaging the student. The parents recorded the phone call and provided it to police.
   
 During the phone conversation, she admitted to having sex with the victim twice, the report said. Zamora offered to take a pregnancy test and send him the results to prove she wasn't pregnant.
   
 At one point, Zamora seemed to try to defend the abuse.
      
 "It was not all me," she said to the parents of the boy. "I am the adult and it was my judgment and it is my job to keep him safe. But it wasn't forced upon. ... I don't want you to think that I forced him or anything like that because I would never do that. I just want to let you know that 100 percent nothing was, like, forced or made him feel threatened or made him feel anything."
   
 Zamora skirted around many of the questions asked by the boy's father. She told him she wasn't denying the messages the parents found, but was concerned about answering any questions over the phone.
   
 "I don't want it to be recorded and go to court," she said.
   
 She offered to meet in person to discuss everything.
   
 Zamora's husband, Daniel Zamora, was texting his wife during her call to the parents. Transcripts provided in the police report detail how he encouraged her to cry, apologize frequently and do whatever she could to seem helpless.
   
 He advised her to insist on an in-person meeting just in case the father was recording.
   
 "Don't admit to any relationship," Daniel Zamora texted his wife. "Because we both know there isn't one and nothing happened. Just stupid fantasy text that went too far."
   
 He urged her to hang up the phone when he felt the conversation had gone on too long.
   
 His text messages went unanswered when she was arrested shortly after.
   
 Court records show Daniel and Brittany Zamora are still married. It's unclear whether Daniel Zamora knew the full extent of what was happening between his wife and the student prior to her arrest.
   
 Conversations between Daniel Zamora, his wife and the father of the victim indicate he thought the relationship wasn't physical. However, the parents' lawsuit accuses Daniel Zamora of failing to alert authorities after he learned of the ongoing molestation.
   
 Zamora was previously charged with 15 counts total, including eight counts of sexual misconduct with a minor. Twelve counts were dismissed as part of the plea deal.
   
 While a plea deal means fewer charges and likely less jail time than if Zamora had been found guilty in a trial, it also means the young victims won't have to take the stand and testify against her while she sits in the courtroom with them.
   
 She will likely spend about 30 years in prison under the peal deal. Zamora would likely be in her 50s when she would be released from prison. She would then have to register as a sex offender and would serve lifetime probation.
   
 The plea agreement also forbids her from having contact with any of the victims or returning to the scene of the crime, which would include the school where she once taught. She'll likely have to pay restitution to her victims.
   
 The boy's parents are seeking $2.5 million in damages, according to a civil lawsuit filed in January against Zamora. It is still ongoing.

By 1919, over 3 million U.S. schoolchildren were enrolled in the Modern Health Crusade and were doing their best to complete 15 health and hygiene chores. In Illinois, there were over 100,000 student crusaders. In McLean County, only a few rural one-room schools and town of Normal grade schools had joined the crusade.
 That fall, Miss M. Grace Osborne, director of school activities for the Illinois Tuberculosis Association (ITA), spoke to a large group at the University of Illinois about the success of the Modern Health Crusade, saying, ‚ÄúMany people who believed that there was nothing new under the sun have come to find that there really is ‚Äî for when you can get a boy of 10 to wash behind his ears every day for 15 weeks without making a row, you have accomplished something.‚Äù Osborne also noted that good habits learned as a child are nearly impossible to forget as an adult; and that if health and hygiene rules become childhood habits, our nation has laid an ‚Äúimmeasurably valuable foundation‚Äù for the elimination of TB in the future.

She smiled and waved as the transport team loaded her into an ambulance for the trip. ‚ÄúWe knew she was tough.

Five other members of the Parks family weren‚Äôt so lucky. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think this day would come.

On May 1, Dominion filed its 2020 Integrated Resource Plan with the SCC detailing how it intends to comply with the legislation. Buried in the plan is what this nearly $6 billion energy tax will cost individual customers: $50 added to their electricity bills every month over the next 15 years, while Dominion only manages to halve, not eliminate, carbon emissions by 2035.
 A second option increases power bills by $45.92 per month at a time when electricity prices are the lowest on record and carbon dioxide emissions in the 13 states served by grid operator PJM have already decreased 34 percent since 2005 in a ‚Äústeady, 15-year decline.‚Äù
 Even industry experts are pointing out that this enormous rate hike during the current pandemic is not only unnecessary, but foolhardy.
 ‚ÄúAn aggressive, single-state clean energy goal paired with a powerful utility spells trouble for Virginia families and businesses already struggling financially due to the COVID-19 pandemic,‚Äù wrote Todd Snitchler, president and CEO of the Electric Power Supply Association, in a May 11 op-ed published in Utility Dive. He warned other states that they should look to Virginia not as a role model, but as a ‚Äúcautionary tale.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúHow can responsible leaders justify burdening their constituents with this expense when there is a more sustainable, cost-effective path to reduce emissions?‚Äù Snitchler asked, adding that ‚Äúthe financial strain could undermine political appetite for clean energy efforts across the board, putting environmental progress at the whim of the next election and plummeting state revenues.‚Äù
 The answer to his question is that imposing what amounts to a $50-per-month energy tax on Virginians when they are not allowed to earn a living is completely irresponsible now, and will become a major economic drag on both families and businesses in the commonwealth as they attempt to recover from this unprecedented health and financial disaster.
 If Snitchler is right, and this expensive and untimely burden creates a backlash against clean energy, Gov. Northam and his fellow Democrats in Richmond will have only themselves to blame.
