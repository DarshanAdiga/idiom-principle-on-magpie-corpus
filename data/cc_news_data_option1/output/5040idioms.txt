 "He deserved his new contract, and it’s the same with Isaiah. He’s got a lot in his locker. There’s one or two really highly thought of by the staff that haven’t signed yet. We take it on board with the staff that deal with them, and when we think it’s right we get them signed on.
 "That’s the future of the club. In the length of their contract, in a couple of years’ time, I think these lads will be flying to get in the first team. Even if they’re not playing or getting on at the minute, just having the experience of training and travelling with the lads is great. It’s got to improve them."

When the tourists return, it would be a much more pleasant experience for vendors as well, she said.
 Speaking in Mandarin, she said: “At least things will be stable. Right now, sometimes there are small conflicts with other vendors over the space we occupy. Even if we earned money, we wouldn’t be happy.”  
 “Next time, it will be smaller but at least we won’t fight, and we can still sell our things,” she said.  
 The downside, she said, is the lottery-like system in getting a space. “It will depend on your luck. If you get a good one, you will be happier. You get a bad one, you sell fewer flowers.”  
 Residents in the area said while they were glad the authorities are sprucing the street up, they did not want the revamp to affect the vendors’ livelihoods.  
 Mdm Mei Pei Ling, 50, who has lived in a flat along the stretch since 1984, said over the years, the place had become messier. Vendors would leave their items at the same spot overnight instead of packing them up and moving them to the side.  
 She said she was afraid items like trolleys and cardboard boxes would catch fire one day, or become a home for rodents.  
 But some of the vendors are her neighbours, and she hoped the shift would not affect their earnings.  
 Mr Ronnie Ma, 50, who has lived in Bras Basah for more than 40 years, said residents started complaining as far back as five or six years ago.  
 They were also afraid the unattended stalls would become breeding grounds for mosquitoes, said Mr Ma, who has been the Kampong Glam Citizens’ Consultative Committee chairman for at least six years.  
 When COVID-19 started to spread, he advised the vendors to be a little more cautious and practise safe distancing, he said.  
 “But it’s difficult,” he said, as stallholders liked the spot they were in and were afraid that business would be affected if they changed locations.  
 Talks between the committee and the Government about the congestion began about two years ago, he said. Committee members told authorities they wanted the place to be tidied up, but wanted to make sure that the vendors could continue to ply their trade. When the pandemic happened, the situation became more urgent.
 “It’s a matter of really making sure that everybody’s interests are being protected and seeing how best we can come up with a solution to address everybody’s concerns,” Mr Ma said.

Dad-of-two David, 55, from Willesden, served in the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders for 16 years. His first tour was in the Falklands in 1996, before he was involved in several tours of Northern Ireland and Afghanistan. Before he left the Army in 2010, he’d risen from Private, a soldier of the lowest military rank, to the position of Corporal, which involved taking command of other soldiers.
 David progressed quickly during his Army career and learned a lot in the process, but afterwards, in attempting to resume a normal day-to-day life, things started to go downhill.
 “I found it hard to adjust to life outside the Army,” says David, originally from Glasgow. “I became increasingly nervous and had little, if any, confidence and self-esteem.”

 It's human nature to enjoy novelty. We like pleasant surprises; look forward to an occasional break in routine. Most of comedy depends on an unanticipated turn of events - case in point the ubiquitous pratfall. But when life becomes a relentless assault on the norm the results can be devastating.
 This year has certainly evidenced an overabundance of startling twists and turns, but finding delight or humor in the unexpected has faded as our collective, battered psyches have become overwhelmed by the unrelenting departure from the predictable, leaving us longing for a more stable - dare I say even boring - return to the commonplace banality of customary routine.
 In perhaps a foreshadowing of what was to come, the unique ascension to the highest office in the land by a former reality star set the stage for what was to become four years of an emotional roller coaster ride, taking the country to dizzying heights before plunging into a terrifying free fall. Of course, part of the enjoyment of an amusement ride is the certainty that it will eventually come to an end, delivering the passengers to safety.
 Evidently hooked on a quest for an adrenaline rush, the fevered faithful have become accustomed to feasting on a steady diet of the latest in increasingly bizarre theories and rallying cries in defense of their beliefs, fed by a growing chorus of profiteering media personalities jumping on the conspiracy bandwagon. If it were merely a matter of entertainment or validation by the like-minded, there might be no harm. Unfortunately, this fictionalized reality, dependent on alternative facts and wild speculation, is swaddled in a mantle of piety and patriotism that may be inflicting real damage to society.
 It is disheartening to watch a public figure, once revered as an example of courage and hope in the aftermath of 9/11, become a source of ridicule; made the butt of jokes.
 It undermines religious leaders and institutions as many become increasingly politicized pawns.
 It becomes a threat to life when patients in need of emergency treatment must be farmed out to distant facilities as hospitals are overwhelmed by COVID-19 at astounding rates.
 It is dangerous when the very foundation of what was the world's ideal of a system of democracy at work, is being eroded. Public servants being harassed or worse, receiving threats of physical harm or death simply for doing their job.
 The familiar trappings of the season have been curtailed; shopping in the close company of others in search of the perfect gift; attending a child's holiday program; gathering with friends and family to celebrate the season - all replaced by uncertainty surrounding the future.
 There does remain one observance we can embrace in this season normally steeped in treasured traditions; may the principle of peace and good will toward others guide us through to a safer and saner new year.

I don't know about you, but I'm at that stage of life where I'm more interested in getting rid of stuff than I am in acquiring more.
 In recent months I've been industriously doing the 'home edit,' and I'm making serious progress, but tough decisions still have to be made.
 A couple of weeks ago, we temporarily moved the train table that is a large part of the living room landscape, since the boy who plays with it won't be in our house for a while - thanks COVID.
 However, removing the table meant revealing the rather unsightly old wooden tool chest it had been resting atop, which left me with a dilemma.
 Should I just get rid of it and use something else once the train table is back, or should I try and refinish it?
 It didn't take long to realize we no longer own anything else that can accommodate said train table (which is actually a board with wooden tracks, bridges, etc. attached to it).
 So refinishing it was, but where to start?
 Upon closer examination of the old tool chest, I realized it had actually started out its life as a blanket box, likely well over a century ago. The back of it had only ever been painted once, in the initial layer of a barn red colour, but the other three sides and top had layers of blue, green and most recently a very hideous beige colour.
 At some point along the way, somebody turned it into a tool chest, adding some modifications on the interior, and turning what was originally one large wooden tray into two smaller ones.
 Not only had that transformation made the interior not particularly useful for anyone who wasn't going to be storing tools in it, but it had also resulted in the chest being rather battered, particularly the top of it which had obviously been used as a platform for various projects over the years.
 My initial plan had been to try and remove the ugly beige layer of paint and I spent a long afternoon trying to hand sand just that layer off. Fail. Then I tried using an electric sander with more or less the same result, albeit with less effort - either nothing came off, or every layer came off!
 Then I thought about going for the gusto and removing all layers of paint, but decided it really wasn't going to be worth the effort.
 Then I thought about leaving it the way it was in all its rustic splendour with various layers of paint and even some bare wood showing through. Two problems with that scenario - the ugly beige was still the predominant colour and the back was still red, with streaks of bare wood courtesy of the electric sander.
 Maybe I should just get rid of it… Aargh, train table!
 Finally, I decided I would just paint the entire thing and then if it was still hideous, I'd put it out front with the knowledge that somebody else would take it and make it their own.
 So, I began by tackling the interior and thanks to number one son's brawn, was able to remove most of the customized tool containment areas.
 Then, after almost discarding the two smaller trays on the inside, as by now I'd decided to use the chest to store my Christmas Dickens Village in, I realized that, flipped over, they'd be perfect as platforms for the various houses.
 So, since they'd never been painted but were coated in decades worth of grime and oil, I sanded them down, then stained and varnished them; an effort that was well worth the time invested!
 I painted the inside of the trunk using some chalk paint I already had on hand, but by now had decided I wanted to paint the exterior in as close to its original barn red as possible, which was not something I could find locally.
 So I turned to Amazon (yes, Amazon is the devil, but it's the devil I know!). There I found a company called Country Chic Paint. A little online investigation revealed that not only was it a Canadian company, but I could actually order my paint online directly from the company, which is out in BC, which is what I did.
 I had to wait a while to get the paint, but it was well worth it as I've now discovered my new favourite chalk paint.
 Before applying any paint to the outside of the chest I decided to seal the entire thing in a coat of Varathane, in hopes of avoiding anything leaking through the new paint.
 Two coats of barn red, another layer of Varathane, a layer of 'aging' and two more of Varathane and finally the thing is done, and if I do say so myself, looks pretty darned good!
 I love thinking about the various people my chest has belonged to over the years, the treasures and memories - not to mention the tools - it has stored, and it makes me feel good to know that it's now well positioned to last another century or two.
 Of course the new problem is - it's too nice to use for the train table. Oh well, I guess we'll cross that track when we get there!
 Stay well my friends.

A: I think each team’s expectations and progress are unique. I didn’t really have a definite timetable in terms of where they needed to be at certain points. There are still things we have to have a lot of improvement on and consistency going forward. We’re far from where we need to be or want to be as a team. There’s a lot of work ahead of us. But I was pleased with the constant progress I saw. There were times earlier in the season that you questioned are we coaching it well enough to make sure that they can get this the right way and execute it on the grass? We go back and we find different ways of coaching things, or maybe different ways of hitting individual players and making sure that we get on the same page with it. But ultimately, I like the progress they’ve made right here. I wouldn’t say they’re ahead or behind any kind of a schedule. I just know that they come to work every day and improve, and that’s carried over on a weekly basis.

Last month, Facebook added a dedicated shopping button to WhatsApp. It's a simple feature that lets you browse a store's catalog and then, if you find something interesting, start a conversation that will presumably lead to a transaction. While helpful, it didn't have a traditional checkout flow. Facebook is rectifying that somewhat with carts. Now, you can browse a catalog and and add multiple items. When you're done, the selections will be shared as a single item (a bit like when you send multiple photos to someone) in your conversation with the business. In theory, these groupings should make it simpler for merchants to accept and track orders.It's a small step toward a traditional checkout experience. For now, though, there doesn't appear to be a formal process for giving your payment and shipping details. WhatsApp is slowly rolling out in-app payments, though, which could solve the problem. Back in June, the company launched the feature in Brazil. One week later, however, it was ordered to suspend the service by the country's central bank, which wanted to "preserve an adequate competitive environment." WhatsApp has since brought payments to India, with support from five banks including Jio Payments Bank. The latter is funded by Reliance Industries, a company that also owns Jio Platforms -- a business that Facebook and Google have invested in.

Just last week, AutoX announced the roll out a fleet of autonomous RoboTaxis in downtown Shenzhen, representing the first time such vehicles have been deployed in China without safety drivers or remote operators.
 Now the Beijing transport authority has given the green light for another first. Five of Baidu Apollo's autonomous vehicles are being allowed to drive around the public streets of the nation's capital without a safety driver aboard.
 In order to meet the stringent safety requirements set by the Beijing authorities for autonomous vehicle testing, Baidu's self-driving cars had to ace more than 30,000 km (18,600+ mi) of perfect test driving on open roads before undergoing an evaluation on a closed test track.
 The test vehicles involved in the public trials will make use of Apollo's AI driving system, which has transported more than 100,000 passengers across 27 cities around the world. But human assistance will be on call in case of emergencies, thanks to the company's 5G Remote Driving Service.
 This system combines smart transport systems, vehicle-to-everything technologies, and high-speed 5G networks to allow human operators to provide an extra safety net when necessary.
 Baidu says that the fully driverless vehicle testing permits will allow the company to "gradually reduce human intervention on test vehicles and eventually remove in-car safety drivers from its autonomous vehicle road tests" and is a key step in the commercialization of autonomous vehicle technologies.

 It is disheartening to watch a public figure, once revered as an example of courage and hope in the aftermath of 9/11, become a source of ridicule; made the butt of jokes.
   
 It undermines religious leaders and institutions as many become increasingly politicized pawns.
   
 It becomes a threat to life when patients in need of emergency treatment must be farmed out to distant facilities as hospitals are overwhelmed by COVID-19 at astounding rates.
   
 It is dangerous when the very foundation of what was the world's ideal of a system of democracy at work, is being eroded. Public servants being harassed or worse, receiving threats of physical harm or death simply for doing their job.
   
 The familiar trappings of the season have been curtailed; shopping in the close company of others in search of the perfect gift; attending a child's holiday program; gathering with friends and family to celebrate the season - all replaced by uncertainty surrounding the future.
   
 There does remain one observance we can embrace in this season normally steeped in treasured traditions; may the principle of peace and good will toward others guide us through to a safer and saner new year.

As a final note, I think Splunk continues to trade for a reasonable valuation at just over 11 times full-year expected ARR of $2.3 billion.

Put simply, this isn't time to panic sell. I still like Splunk's long-term prospects, and I think making a purchase now will pay off down the road.

But I can dig in on reasons why revenue fell short of projections. In keeping with the first two quarters of the year, some of Splunk's recent shortcomings can be attributed to its transition to cloud-based software. Basically, when a term contract (in which all of the revenue was realized up front) got replaced with a cloud contract (in which revenue is realized over time), the result looked like a loss of income. It isn't a loss, however, just an accounting change. In normal circumstances, a company's migration to more modern cloud software business contracts would be a good thing. But Splunk has been managing a rapid migration to the cloud among its customers, and the recent turbulence in business results (and thus stock price) can be chalked up to this.

Since then, poets and writers have used it as an allegory for love, duty, conflict and accomplishment.

With a vapor chamber within to help draw heat into the fins, it's a tried and true design, and certainly AMD's best tri-fan cooler to date. Coupled with the above- average height of the card (120mm), the 6900 XT ends up being a thick card, though not unusually so from other 300W+ card designs. Accordingly, you'll want to give the cooler a wide berth for air intake. Otherwise the 10.5-inch (267mm) length means that it should fit into most cases without running into the front of the case.

However, although the first wave of accounts has matured since then, tens of thousands remain unclaimed.
 As a result, millions of pounds are currently sitting in dormant accounts.
 The AFM has now called on the Government and the financial services industry to urge young people to take control of their money.
 Martin Shaw, CEO of the Association of Financial Mutuals, said it is vital for people to find their CTF provider to sort out the issue.
 Providers should have sent out statements before a child’s eighteenth birthday.
 Such statements show how much a fund is worth and what actions need to be taken next.
 But for those who have not received a statement, people will need to investigate who currently holds the fund, because a provider may not have the individual’s latest address.
 The Government has established an online Child Trust Fund tracker to help you get to the bottom of this.
 HMRC will send details of the Child Trust Fund provider by post within three weeks of receiving a request.
 Parents applying will need to provide the child’s Unique Reference Number, which you can find on your annual CTF statement, or their National Insurance number.
 If you’re looking for your own trust fund, you’ll just need your National Insurance number.

HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (AP) — Students have returned to class in one of Alabama’s largest school systems after a cyberattack shut down the system last week, but students in Huntsville are doing their work on paper rather than computers. Huntsville city schools said in an update that students still didn’t have access to computers as classes resumed Monday, a week after the attack first forced a shutdown. Workers spent the weekend helping teachers make copies and delivering them to schools, officials said in a message posted on the system's website, and students who aren’t in traditional classes because of the pandemic also are getting paper copies rather than virtual lessons. Teachers and students still aren’t allowed to turn on electronic devices. Bol Coln, the principal of Challenger Middle School, said many parents had picked up lesson packets, and administrators were trying to make sure each child received the materials. “I personally will take it to their house if I have to, because they have to be getting the information. So my assistant principal and I will probably deliver a lot of them if they don’t pick them up, but I know we are having a pretty good turn out,” Coln told news outlets. With nearly 23,000 students, more than 2,000 employees and about 40 schools, Huntsville City Schools closed early on Nov. 30 because of what officials described as a ransomware attack and remained closed the rest of the week. In a typical ransomware attack, hackers gain access to a computer system and threaten to withhold or destroy information unless money is paid. School officials haven’t released details on the type of attack that forced the shutdown, and it's unclear what information migth be compromised.

"Of course, my burpees got better and I stood up a little straighter. I felt I owed it to the system to do a better job because I was so proud. It's interesting how [integrated, dynamic smart metrics] take it to another level compared to a typical video experience." Apple trainer Betina Gozo, who specializes in strength and core, says these kinds of features factor into how trainers plan their workouts. "Being able to motivate users through coaching, as well as through the metrics on their Apple Watch, is really cool," says Gozo. "Knowing the connection with the Apple Watch can help push them further is incredibly powerful in workout design." For activities in which a metric like calories burned is less important, like yoga, the data is minimized.

For the 6900 XT launch, AMD sent over a proper picture of the PCB, confirming that this is the same board design (if not identical PCB) as to what's used for the 6800 XT. The one difference at the surface is that AMD has populated the final VRM phase, which went unused on the 6800 XT. As a result the 6900 XT offers 16 VRM phases, 3 of which go to the VRAM while the other 13 feed the GPU. One more VRM phase shouldn't make any radical differences, but it's one more thing AMD has done to squeeze out a bit more efficiency from the card and allow them to hold the line on TDP at 300 Watts.

Rohese Devereux, mum to Lemba, 11 weeks, says: "This is a sturdy seat with side impact protection and plenty of cushioning to support smaller babies. The headrest is adjustable as the baby grows, but the generous padding makes it a little harder to lift out smaller babies with poor head control. Our chunky three month old looks pretty snug in this seat already, so might outgrow it before the seat limits specified. Fixing the seat and removing it from the base is easy and smooth, not requiring any wiggling or tugging – unlike some other seats. The sunshade pulls down almost to baby’s toes, allowing for cosy snoozing or full body protection from the sun. The handle is comfy to hold, and lifting the seat on and off the pushchair chassis is exceptionally easy, thanks to the one-hand release function."

India captain Virat Kohli on Tuesday hinted that he might skip the three-day pink-ball warm-up game ahead of the eagerly-awaited Test series against Australia after an intense limited-overs leg of the tour ended with his team winning the T20 series 2-1 in Sydney on Tuesday.
 The tour game against Australia A is due to begin in three days’ time and will be India’s final tune-up before the opening day-night Test in Adelaide from December 17.
 Kohli will lead the team in the opener of the four-match series, after which he will go back to India for the birth of his first child.
 “I will wake up tomorrow and see if I can play the tour match. Playing it on and off is not my thing and I like to play the full game. I will talk to our physio and then decide on my participation,” Kohli said after the third and final T20 International in Sydney, which India lost by 12 runs.
 Australian bowlers held their nerves to come up trumps after Kohli’s brilliant 85-run knock, stalling an Indian clean-sweep.
 Overall, Kohli was pleased with the way his side fought and found ways to win matches from tough situations.
 “We are finding ways to come back and give the opposition a scare and the series win is a little asterisk for us to finish the 2020 season on a high.”
 Like in the previous game, Hardik Pandya, in the company of Kohli, again threatened to win the game for India after he had hit a couple of sixes.
 “At one stage when Hardik started going, we thought we could pull it off. The middle over phase during our batting cost us the game. A partnership of 30-odd would’ve made it easier for Hardik.”
 Kohli also thanked the sports-loving Australian crowd for the manner in which it turned up despite the threat posed by the Covid-19 pandemic.
 “I feel the crowd was a factor as well, it’s always giving you a dimension of motivation. Our crowd pulls us through sometimes, and Australia has got great support too, and we as players feed off the crowd’s energy.”
 Having won the series, Kohli was looking forward to the Tests and said the current team is stronger than the one that made history by winning its first Test series Down Under two years ago.
 “We need to take the same competitive attitude into the Tests, and having played here a few times, we can score runs as well.
 “Once it’s time to capitalise and score, we need to do that session by session. I’m sure the current side is stronger than last time,” Kohli said.
 Australian captain Aaron Finch was delighted to be on the winning side after the reverses in the first two matches.
 “It was a great series, and we just happened to be on the wrong end of the first two. It’s the first time we’ve had two leg-spinners (Adam Zampa and Mitchell Swepson) in the side, and they were bold with the short boundaries here, so credit to both of them.
 “Swepson bowled the 7th over against Shikhar (Dhawan) and Virat, both destructive in their own ways, but Zamps bowled really well as well. We played some great white-ball cricket over the last 18 months and really proud of the bunch,” Finch said.
 Swepson was named the Man of the Match for returning fine figures of 3/23, including the wicket of in-form opener Dhawan, in his quota of four overs.
 “Happy to get this award, and win the game for my side. I think that was a bit of a skidder, but I’m happy to say that I gave it a bit of a rip and got that wicket (of Shreyas Iyer).

Diving into the specs, what we're looking at is a bona fide, genuine, fully- enabled Navi 21 part. All 80 CUs and 128 ROPs are active on this card, allowing Navi 21 to show off just how powerful it really is. AMD is clocking the card the same as the 6800 XT, so that means a peak clockspeed (boost clock) of 2250MHz, while the official game clock rating is 2015MHz. So on paper, the 6900 XT should be 11% faster in texture/compute/RT-bound workloads, while pixel-bound workloads should be relatively unchanged from the 6800 XT. It is admittedly not the largest leap, but it's enough to justify a separate SKU - and for AMD to make a run at the GeForce RTX 3090.

A: I think it’s a combination of both, but really tying more into the mobility of it. When there’s pressure in the pocket, can he sidestep, can he step up? If he has to leave the pocket and scramble, if there’s a gap open for him to go ahead and tuck that ball and run to get a first down, are these things we’re okay with him doing and we’re confident that he’s going to go out there and do it without getting hurt worse. We talk about defending himself, I want to make sure that when his natural instincts kick in as a player, that he’s not limited somehow physically or someone has an advantage over him on the field. That’s just not fair for us to do. These are great athletes on the field, they’re playing very aggressive, and he’s at the toughest position in terms of holding the ball every play and everybody trying to take your head off. He has to be able to have some kind of mobility. Just sidestep the hit, step up in the pocket, escape pressure and throw the ball away. I have to make sure we do the right thing by him of making sure we don’t put him out there on the field where he can’t do that, he’s just a sitting duck.

Life was disrupted in several parts of the country on Tuesday as shops and commercial establishments stayed closed, transport was affected and protesters squatted on key roads and rail tracks in response to a 'Bharat Bandh' called by farmers demanding a repeal of the new agri laws.As the day wound to a mostly peaceful close and the farmers termed their show of strength a success, Union Home Minister Amit Shah stepped in to call their leaders for talks, ahead of the sixth round of talks between Central ministers and farmer representatives on Wednesday."There is no midway. We will demand just a 'yes' or a 'no' from Home Minister Amit Shah," farmer leader Rudru Singh Mansa told reporters at the Singhu border where thousands of farmers have been protesting for the last 12 days. A delegation of 13 leaders will meet Shah. The nationwide shutdown was observed in around 10,000 places in 25 states, claimed Swaraj India leader Yogendra Yadav. Emergency services were exempted and banks, too, continued operations as the pan-India shutdown, backed by most opposition parties and trade unions, rolled out noisily but peacefully with its impact felt in Punjab, Haryana and Delhi, the epicentre of the snowballing protests, as well as in states such as Odisha, Maharashtra, Bihar and Jharkhand.The pandemic appeared to recede into the background as security was stepped up across the country, restive crowds demonstrated in some places and the numbers swelled at Delhi's border points. Protesters also blocked railway tracks at several places in West Bengal, Bihar and Odisha.As slogans such as "Kisan Ekta Zindabad" were heard in protest centrepoints such as Tikri and the agitation picked up pace, so did social media with the hashtag #Aaj_Bharat_Bandh_Hai trending worldwide till late afternoon.From the Rajasthan capital Jaipur, where 'mandis' were closed but shops open, there were reports of clashes between workers of the state's ruling Congress and the BJP.In Delhi, where most main markets were open, tension spiralled with the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) alleging that Delhi Police had put Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal under house arrest till evening. City police denied the claim but AAP leaders stuck to their stand.Farmer unions had threatened to block national highways and occupy toll plazas across the country during a 'chakka jam' protest from 11 am to 3 pm.All India Kisan Sabha general secretary Hannan Mollah described the shutdown as a show of strength by the farmers."We are standing by our demand that we want a complete repeal of the three laws and will not accept any cosmetic changes… If our demands are not met, we are ready to take our agitation to the next level," Mollah said. The protesting farmers fear the new laws will pave the way for eliminating the safety of the Minimum Support Price cushion and do away with 'mandis', leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. The government maintains the new laws will bring farmers better opportunities and usher in new technologies in agriculture.Opposition parties are expected to meet Kovind on Wednesday evening to raise their concerns about the three laws. "Leaders from different political parties (those opposing the farm bills) will sit, discuss and take a collective stand on the contentious farm laws before meeting President Ram Nath Kovind," NCP chief Sharad Pawar told reporters.Farmers from Punjab and also Haryana have been the drivers of the movement against the laws. In both states, shops and commercial establishments were closed as were thousands of fuel pumps. Farmers assembled at highways and other key roads in both states since morning. All major parties in Punjab -- the ruling Congress, AAP and the Shiromani Akali Dal -- extended their support.Over 50,000 government employees took mass casual leave in support of farmers, said Punjab Civil Secretariat Staff Association president Sukhchain Khaira.In neighbouring BJP-JJP ruled Haryana, the opposition Congress and Indian National Lok Dal extended their support.The Haryana Police traffic advisory had warned commuters that main national highways would be closed and the peak time of impact was expected to be between 12 noon to 3 pm.In West Bengal, where the ruling Trinamool Congress joined the Congress and the Left in supporting the shutdown but stayed away from enforcing it, the response was mixed. Railway tracks were blocked in several places and there were sit-ins on major roads.Life was hit in Bihar too with train tracks, highways and inner roads teeming with protesters as opposition parties extended their support. In Jehanabad, the movement of Patna-Palamu Express was obstructed for a few minutes until the bandh supporters, squatting on the tracks, were chased away by the police.Train services were also affected in Odisha as activists of farmers' organisations, trade unions and political parties held sit-ins on tracks in Bhubaneswar, Cuttack, Bhadrak and Balasore.Elsewhere in the state, ruled by the Biju Janata Dal, normal life was hit with markets and offices shut and Congress and Left supporters blocking major roads. Major cities in Congress-ruled Chhattisgarh were deserted with most business establishments closed and public transport keeping away.In Maharashtra, where the ruling Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress combine extended its support, wholesale markets in major cities like Pune, Nashik, Nagpur and Aurangabad were shut. Retail shops also downed shutters in many cities.Agriculture Produce Market Committees (APMCs) were closed in many parts of the state.The state government appealed to protesters to not disrupt public transport services and buses and local trains were unaffected."…The situation needs to be created to put pressure on the government, and to achieve this, farmers need to hit the streets. But no one should resort to violence," said social activist Anna Hazare who went on daylong fast in his village Ralegan Siddhi village in Maharashtra's Ahmednagar district.There was a mixed response in other states as well. In Assam, shops pulled down shutters, protesters blocked traffic and demonstrations were staged but most offices were functioning. Dozens of protesters were detained, officials said.The ruling TRS and opposition parties, including the Congress and various unions, held protests across Telangana. In Tamil Nadu, the opposition DMK and its allies, including the Congress, held protests across the state but life was mostly unaffected. In the union territory of Puducherry, ruled by the Congress, however, the 'bandh' call evoked a near total response. Normal life was affected in parts of Karnataka as farmers and workers hit the roads. Many organisations in the state came out in support of the bandh. In some states, including in Goa, Himachal Pradesh, Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh, life continued unimpeded. The three contentious laws at the centre of the farmer protests are the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.

As for memory, because AMD was already making full use of Navi 21's 8 memory channels for the 6800 XT, they don't have the same headroom to tap into here for the 6900 XT. As a result the card ships with the same 16GB of GDDR6 clocked at 16Gbps/pin, giving it a total memory bandwidth of 512GB/sec. This means that the 6900 XT will hit memory bottlenecks in roughly the same place as the 6800 XT does, which can limit some of the card's real-world performance gains versus what we see on paper. AMD's 128MB Infinity Cache is still in play here as well, though like the rest of the memory subsystem, it's not clocked any higher on the 6900 XT than the 6800 XT.
