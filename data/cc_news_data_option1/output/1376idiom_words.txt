“The staff told another family member more or less that he had Covid.
 “He had mucus, they put a cannula in his arm, and they were giving him morphine and he was peaceful.
 “But his wife was so distraught that he had gone in there and now she couldn’t see him.
 “She is a determined woman, so I know how much pressure was put on the nursing staff.
 “I understand the nursing staff discussed it with management and they allowed her to go in on Friday.
 “I know that the nursing staff were unhappy about her going it. They are in an impossible position.
 “They gowned her up, I don’t know if she had a mask, I presume she did, but she saw him in the home and then left.
 “I’m now being told she wants to go back in and see him again.
 “What are they thinking about?”
 She continued:”I was a senior nurse and I know the pressure they are under. But what are they thinking about?
 “Nobody should be getting in anywhere at the moment.
