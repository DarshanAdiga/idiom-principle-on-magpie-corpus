Hello, my friends and fellow Albertans. I am pleased that our province is gradually and safely beginning to reopen.
 I want to encourage you to make the effort to shop local right here in Sherwood Park. Our local small businesses are the heart and soul of our community. They have been there for us, supporting our local sports teams, sponsoring our kids' clubs. Where ever you can please support are entrepreneurs that help keep our community going.
 Our Alberta MLAs were recalled to the Legislature this week. With more Albertans heading back to work, it is important our province's policymakers come together to debate legislation to get our province back on track. Our focus will be on creating jobs, providing industry certainty, and protecting vulnerable Albertans. Our government has already started or completed 56 per cent of our election promises, and we are committed to fulfilling our promises to Albertans to create jobs, stand up for our province, and make life better for everyone. MLAs will continue to practice physical distancing while in the chamber, where possible, and every effort will be made to ensure limited contact between members, media, and legislature staff in an effort to keep everyone safe and healthy.
 I am happy to share that our government is investing more than $170 million to help keep residents and staff in long-term care, designated supportive living facilities, and seniors' lodges safe from COVID-19. One of the key conditions for Alberta's relaunch is strong protection for the most vulnerable, including those in assisted living facilities. This funding will be used to increase staff, purchase necessary cleaning supplies, and address lost accommodation revenue required during the pandemic. The funding will be distributed each month to help with the costs of fighting the COVID-19 pandemic in these facilities, and will be in place until the orders from Alberta's chief medical officer of health are lifted. The health and dignity of seniors in care are extremely important, and our government is taking steps to keep residents and staff safer during these incredibly challenging times.
 Last week, our province also launched the Human Trafficking Task Force, which will find ways to prevent human trafficking, and protect and empower survivors. Anti-human trafficking advocate Paul Brandt will lead the seven- member task force that will provide guidance and recommendations on how to best implement the government's strategy to combat human trafficking in Alberta. The panel will provide recommendations on how to support survivors, enhance collaboration between organizations working on this issue, engage experts on how to bring sustainable change, and lobby other levels of government to take coordinated action against human trafficking. Alberta should be a place where people can live free from exploitation and coercion, and the new Human Trafficking Task Force will help shine a light on an important issue in our province and make change.
 Thank you for your patience and resilience throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Your efforts make me proud to live in such a wonderful community. Please continue to visit alberta.ca/covid19 for up-to-date information on COVID-19 in our province.
  _Jordan Walker is the Member of the Legislature Assembly for the Sherwood Park constituency. If you have any questions or comments about this column or any other provincial issues, he would like to hear from you. Please contact Walker’s constituency officer at 780-417-4747 or by email sherwood.park@assembly.ab.ca._

Meanwhile in Oslo, Prime Minister Erna Solberg, announced that Danes would also be able visit Norway in the summer.
 However both countries will remain closed to Sweden and Finland for the time being, with Norway also being closed to Icelanders.
 "There are today areas in all Nordic countries with a low level of infection, but there are areas in some Nordic countries with a very high level of infection," Solberg told a press conference.
 "That means we can't have a general opening between Nordic countries immediately." The Danish border remains closed to Finland and Sweden, which will, however, be able to benefit from an agreement before the rest of the European countries.
 With 430 deaths per million people, Sweden has a much higher death rate linked to the new coronavirus than that of neighbouring Nordic countries Norway (43 death per million), Denmark (98), Finland (56) and Iceland (29), which have all imposed much stricter measures aimed at curbing the spread of the disease.
 Both Norway and Denmark however said they were currently in talks with Sweden about opening the border between the countries.

“This is a challenge, but meeting tough challenges is what the Boston Marathon is all about," Walsh said, invoking the response to the finish line bombings seven years ago. "It’s a symbol of our city’s and our commonwealth’s resilience. So it’s incumbent upon all of us to dig deep, like a marathon runner, like we did in 2013, and keep that spirit alive.”

However, he went on to say that progress during this crisis would not come from the government alone. “We additionally need help from the community. We need to make sure that people are looking out for our city right now. It's not just enough to do the right thing for yourself. We need to make sure that all of us are upholding the ideals that we stand by.”

Plan A is persuasion -- encouraging employers to take back their workers and put them on the payroll even if the economy is not in full swing. That way, workers have the security of a job to return to, and firms can ratchet up their work as health and safety allow. In statements that would have seemed absurd just a few months ago, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has taken to using his daily briefings to beg employers to bring back their workers and let the federal government foot the bill.

Secondly, most sex crimes are in the family, close friends, or close relatives. These are people that are not easy to convince that the offender should get a life sentence. If family members don’t agree on the prosecution, is the prosecutor really going to send family members to jail? If the family doesn’t agree cases will crumble.

Interior Minister Horst Seehofer has also waded into the argument, saying his ministry was following the death threat "very closely, with a strategy of zero tolerance".
 In an interview with Spiegel published Friday, Bild editor-in-chief Julian Reichelt insisted the study had used "questionable methods" and accused other media of mounting a "evil campaign against perfectly legitimate reporting".
 \- 'Social media swamp' - Drosten has repeatedly taken to Twitter to defend himself -- but this is a double-edged sword, as Spiegel has pointed out: "The more Drosten uses his social media power, the more he himself is drawn into the social media swamp. And this is not a good place for a scientist." The virologist already warned in his podcast back in March that too much media attention would push scientists to withdraw from public life.
 "I see myself drawn as a cartoonish figure and it makes me feel bad," he said, warning that a tendency to "dramatise" in the media could sow "dissatisfaction in society".
 Drosten, whose team at Berlin's Charite university hospital was the first worldwide to develop a test-kit for COVID-19, quickly found himself thrust into the spotlight when the pandemic reached Germany and he became a trusted advisor to the government.
 He has been called a "guru" and "godsend" for his expertise on the virus. Polls show strong public backing for the government measures which have sharply lowered the rate of infection and allowed for an opening up of businesses and restaurants.
 Drosten's podcast on the virus has consistently topped national charts since it was launched in February in collaboration with public broadcaster NDR and he has become a regular on panels and talk shows.
 But opposition to virus restrictions has swelled in recent weeks, even as the states move to begin relaxing the measures, with thousands taking part in rowdy, sometimes violent demonstrations in German cities.
 The movement brings together diverse groups of conspiracy theorists, political extremists, so-called anti-vaxxers, and people concerned about a curtailment of civil liberties.
 Authorities have also pointed to a troubling anti-Semitic streak in some of the groups' messaging. More than 60 protests are planned across the country this weekend.

What is more, this is not a problem that only poor countries will face. Even though poor countries will be hit the hardest, we are seeing the consequences here in the US already. Consider, for instance, that "a survey…found 37% of unemployed Americans ran out of food in the past month and 46% said they worried about running out." Although deaths directly caused by hunger may not be high in the US, we must keep in mind that malnourishment also harms our health and leads to more deaths in the long run.

LONDON (AP) — British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and U.S. President Donald Trump discussed the possibility Friday of meeting in person at the upcoming G-7 gathering in the United States — a session called into question by the global COVID-19 pandemic.
 Trump said last week he’s considering holding a meeting in the U.S. with the leaders of the world’s major economies after all. Trump had scheduled the Group of Seven summit for June 10-12 at Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland.
 Then in March, he canceled the annual meeting because of the pandemic and said that the leaders would talk by video conference instead.
 The announcement was the latest effort by Trump to signal to the nation that the U.S. economy is getting back up to speed after shutdowns meant to slow the spread of COVID-19.
 Johnson’s Downing Street office said in a statement Friday that the two leaders also discussed the importance of international cooperation to develop a vaccine for the new coronavirus, in hopes of restoring some sense of normalcy to global affairs.
 Johnson invited Trump to take part in the Global Vaccine Summit that the UK is hosting on 4 June.

BOZEMAN, Mont. (AP) — A grizzly bear has mauled a mountain biker on a trail near the Spanish Peaks Mountain Club in southern Montana, causing severe injuries to his face and neck.
 Peter Scherfig was biking alone on his 61st birthday Monday when he was attacked, the Bozeman Daily Chronicle reported. He was taken by ambulance to Big Sky Medical Center, flown to Billings for further treatment and then flown to Portland, Oregon on Thursday, authorities said.
 Scherfig remains in critical but stable condition. His injuries required major cranial and facial reconstruction and his jaw is wired shut. He also suffered a punctured lung and broken ribs.
 Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks spokesman Morgan Jacobsen said it was considered a surprise encounter. The department did not try to find the bear since its behavior was not considered predatory.
 “Very commonly grizzly bears act defensively in surprise close encounters with humans,” Jacobsen said. “It appears that’s what happened in this case.”
 Southwest Montana Mountain Bike Association board member Melissa Cronin said it is important to be aware of bears when on trails. Jacobsen recommended trail users to carry bear spray, noise makers or travel in groups.

But it's not just weather around the pad that matters – teams have to monitor a massive flightpath and the conditions below it in the event that Behnken and Hurley have to abort, hurtling the spacecraft away from its Falcon 9 rocket and into the Atlantic Ocean. If conditions at sea are too rough, the launch is a "no-go."
 Meanwhile, Bridenstine said, the astronauts – both longtime friends and space shuttle veterans – have been spending time with their families and continuing preps for the one-to-four-month stay at the ISS.
 "They've started a tradition of launching little rockets from the beach," Bridenstine said of KSC's famous "Astronaut Beach House," a place where crews have historically spent time relaxing with families and friends. "I would imagine they're probably getting some downtime and thinking about what's coming."
 Also on Saturday, President Trump is expected to return to the Space Coast to watch the liftoff of Demo-2. He'll be joined by Vice President Pence on the deck of Operations and Support Building II, which offers an unobstructed view of pad 39A from just over 3 miles away.
 But despite high-profile visitors, Bridenstine was clear that Behnken and Hurley will launch when teams are ready.
 "We have all been in agreement that there will be no pressure," he said of the mission to return astronauts to flight from U.S. soil, which hasn't happened since 2011. "We will launch when we are ready. The president and the vice president were proud of the NASA team and the SpaceX team for making the right call for the right reasons."

SELDOM SCORING
 Perhaps appropriately for a team with a long-standing reputation as an intimidating, defense-first organization, the Ducks' biggest problems during their two-year playoff drought have been all about offense. Eakins was hired last summer to implement a speed-based system designed to produce more scoring opportunities, but it’s just not happening yet.
 One season after Anaheim finished last in the NHL in goals, its minus-39 goal differential this season was the conference's worst. Anaheim scored two or fewer regulation goals in a whopping 39 of its 71 games. Only Adam Henrique (26 goals) and Jakob Silfverberg (21) found the net with any frequency.
 The Ducks' problems ranged from Rickard Rakell's two-year regression to the disappointing numbers from youngsters who weren't ready to produce at the highest level. Murray also curiously gave up on Ondrej Kase and Daniel Sprong in February, trading two young forwards with clear NHL-caliber scoring ability when they didn't produce enough for his liking.
 IN THE CREASE
 Gibson and Miller didn't post impressive statistics, but anybody who watched these Ducks knew their most valuable players were between the pipes. Gibson's game has grown and matured even while his team has regressed, and the 39-year- old Miller still shows no drop-off in his abilities. If Miller decides to return for another NHL season, he'll have the chance to pass Dominik Hasek on the NHL's career victories list — and the Ducks won't have to worry about this vital position for another year.
 DROP THE BALLS
 The Ducks have an 8.5% chance of getting the No. 1 overall pick in the NHL's complicated draft lottery. Anaheim hasn't had a top-five draft pick since 2005, when it snagged Bobby Ryan with the second overall choice. Murray and his scouting department have a long history of finding impressive talent outside the first round, but they'll likely have the opportunity to choose a game-changing star this summer for the first time. The Ducks also have Boston's first-round pick from their trade of Kase.
 DARK BLUE LINE
 Anaheim’s collection of defensemen appears to be thoroughly average, and none seems likely to get much better. Cam Fowler, Hampus Lindholm and Josh Manson are solid pros, but they're likely past the points in their development where they could become stars. The Ducks could use an injection of game-changing talent on the blue line.
