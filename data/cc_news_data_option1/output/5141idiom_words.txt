To test the two-temperature method, MacCrehan devised a PDMS "charging station" with a hot plate on one side and a cooling plate on the other (so the "hot stays hot and the cool stays cool," as a 1980s commercial jingle put it). He prepared various samples by placing the DNT on the hot side, where the chemical was warmed to temperatures ranging from 30 to 35 degrees Celsius (86 to 95 degrees Fahrenheit) -- well below the temperature that would cause TNT to detonate. The PDMS was kept a relatively cool 20 degrees Celsius, or about room temperature, on the other side of the charging station.
