Laeek Khan approached police in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh after he realized the lamp did not have any magical powers, as described in the popular folk tale about Aladdin and his wish-granting genie that appears when the lamp is rubbed.

"The cheats had struck a deal for much more, but the doctor had paid about 7 million rupees ($93,000)," Amit Rai, a senior officer, told Agence France- Presse (AFP).
