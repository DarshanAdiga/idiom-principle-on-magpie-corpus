LONDON -- German zinc producer Metallwerk Dinslaken (MWD) has just announced it is closing.
 You'd be forgiven for not noticing.
 The news didn't register with the London Metal Exchange (LME) zinc price. The company is too small with just 41 employees and annual production of 25,000 tonnes, a metallic drop in the 13.5-million-tonne global zinc ocean.
 It's also a secondary processor, converting scrap back into refined metal, and the notoriously opaque recycling sector doesn't feature much in zinc's market narrative.
 Yet companies such as MWD are supposed to be the beating heart of the European Union's (EU) newly-unveiled industrial strategy.
 The "European Green Deal," aimed at climate neutrality by 2050, will "need a secure supply of clean and affordable energy and raw materials." ("A new industrial strategy for Europe," European Commission, March 20, 2020).
 The EU's revitalized "raw materials initiative" places great emphasis on the role of recycling as a way of reducing reliance on imported metals to feed the region's manufacturing sector.
 None of which is going to help MWD, which is caught between a collapse in scrap collection networks and a collapse in demand for its products.
 COVID-19 is taking a rising toll on what remains of Europe's metal production capacity, particularly in the recycling sector. We could be seeing a rerun of the global financial crisis, which saw a major migration of the world's metals smelting capacity to China.
 That is not part of European leaders' vision for the future of their industrial sector.
 LOOKING THE WRONG WAY?
 Europe's new resource activism is fired by dreams of electric vehicles and battery metals such as lithium, cobalt and nickel.
 "We are making significant progress in becoming self-sufficient in the lithium industry," said European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic after a virtual meeting of the European Battery Alliance.
 Four sustainable mining projects are now underway with the goal of meeting 80% of Europe's lithium needs in the battery sector by 2025, he said. ("The European Battery Alliance to support EU's post coronavirus recovery," May 19, 2020).
 The Battery Alliance might also want to consider the fate of Recylex's German operations, which have just been placed under bankruptcy protection.
 No conventional vehicle can start without a lead-acid battery. Even most electric vehicles need one for basic start, lighting and software functions.
 Lead's super-high recycling rates make it the sort of circular economy material so prized by the European Union.
 However, the Weser-Metall lead smelter in Nordenham has been out of action since March, it too suffering from the double blow of broken scrap supply chains and plummeting demand and prices.
 With annual production of around 100,000 tonnes of metal, fed by recycled lead-acid batteries, Nordenham is one of Europe's last big "urban miners" in the lead sector.
 It may yet survive as might the other zinc and lead recycling components of Recylex' German arm but gone is the French company's concept of a pan-European integrated supply chain.
 In the dash to secure tomorrow's raw materials, Europe risks losing the metals capacity it already has.
 SAVE OUR SMELTERS
 "Shutdowns of European aluminum smelters should be prevented," according to European Aluminium.
 The 80-member alliance of European aluminum companies, in an open letter to the European Commission, warned that "reduced European production will only increase our dependency on primary imports with a significantly higher carbon footprint." ("Call for a sustainable industrial recovery plan," May 2020)
 Every industrial sector has its own case to plead right now but Europe's aluminum sector can point out it never recovered from the last financial crisis.
 Many smelters closed a decade ago as aluminum prices tumbled. Not all of them made it back and a second wave of low prices over 2011 and 2012 forced another even bigger round of closures.
 European aluminum smelters produced 4.6 million tonnes of metal in 2008. Last year the total was just 3.4 million tonnes.
 What are often older higher-cost operators have struggled to compete against a new generation of mega smelters in China, the rising star of global aluminum production.
 COVID-19 represents another potential body blow with the LME aluminum price currently trading near four year lows below $1,500 per tonne.
 Yet aluminum has been identified as a key material for the green economy targeted by Europe's leaders.
 It was found by the World Bank to be both critical for new energy development and a metal that is used across the renewable spectrum of clean energy sources.
 It is also highly recyclable.
 Can Europe afford to lose more aluminum smelters? If it does, its dependence on imports will only grow.
 ACCELERATOR
 Back in 2008-2009 the global financial crisis accelerated the hollowing out of Europe's industrial metals production capacity.
 What Europe lost, China gained. Beijing's massive infrastructure splurge fed the country's booming metals demand over the early years of the last decade. That in turn accelerated China's own strategy of building out its own smelter network.
 China was once the world's largest refined metals buyer. Now, it is now the world's largest buyer of metal raw materials to feed its massive production capacity.
 Some of China's metals capacity now feeds the rest of the world in semi- manufactured form such as aluminum sheet or as finished products such as lead- acid batteries and air-conditioning units.
 COVID-19 has generated just the same toxic combination of weak demand and low prices that hurt European producers ten years ago.
 A similar outcome this time around would blow a big hole in Europe's green and clean industrial revolution before it even starts.
 "As world regions begin their recovery from COVID-19 at different speeds, there is a real risk that Europe's import reliance further increases," according to European metals group Eurometaux, writing in an open May 14 letter to the European Commission.
 "Recovering economies like China will have a strong rationale to oversupply global markets or engage in strategic stockpiling while their domestic demand remains at low levels," it added.
 It calls for fair trade conditions, echoing a plank of Europe's new industrial strategy, which stresses the importance of a "rules-based multilateral trading system."
 Disputes with China over its aluminum and steel production are long-running and unlikely to be miraculously solved any time soon.
 Fair trade may have to wait.
 The more immediate priority for Europe's leaders is how to stop coronavirus wrecking a metals supply chain that is core to the continent's vision of remaining an industrial power-house.

What remains of Opus 29 are two ternary-form movements separated by an Andante elegiaco, which is devoted entirely to a thoroughly ravishing _pas de deux_ adagio. The second ternary-form movement, a Scherzo, interleaves the male and female variations with four demi-soloist couples. The symphony's final movement then sets a grand finale, filling the stage with a generously-sized _corps de ballet_ while also allowing the _pas de deux_ soloists their own razzle-dazzle coda. This all climaxes in stunning unison work as "all hands" join forces in the stately recapitulation of the the final movement's second theme. Balanchine not only knew every note of this symphony but also knew how to make every note register with both ear and eye.

The filter's design consists of a square area that contains blood clotting agent, adjoined by a channel that collects the plasma. Blood is dropped on the square area, where the clotting agent forces the blood to clot, and the blood cells become stuck there. The plasma flows into the channel through capillary action—a natural phenomenon resulting from the interplay between two kinds of forces, cohesion and adhesion (the same force that enables water to flow into a plant through its roots).

In December 2017, Flynn pleaded guilty to one count of lying to federal investigators about his contacts with former Russian ambassador to the U.S Sergey Kislyak after the election and before Mr. Trump took office. But in January, Flynn asked the federal district court to allow him to withdraw his guilty plea, pointing to the government's "bad faith, vindictiveness and breach of the plea agreement."
 The request from Flynn comes as a newly declassified email from Susan Rice, President Obama's national security adviser, shows former FBI Director James Comey was concerned about Flynn's discussions with Kislyak but didn't believe Flynn shared classified information with the Russian envoy. The full text of the email was declassified by the Trump administration and obtained by CBS's Herridge on Tuesday.
 Rice sent an email to herself on Inauguration Day, January 20, 2017, detailing a meeting held in the Oval Office two weeks prior about the FBI's investigation into Russian meddling and Flynn. Present for the meeting were Mr. Obama, then-Vice President Joe Biden, Comey, Rice and then-acting Attorney General Sally Yates.
 According to Rice's newly-declassified account of the meeting, Comey "affirmed that he is proceeding 'by the book' as it relates to law enforcement."
 "From a national security perspective, Comey said he does have some concerns that incoming NSA Flynn is speaking frequently with Russian Ambassador Kisylak," Rice wrote in the email she sent to herself. "Comey said that could be an issue as it relates to sharing sensitive information.  President Obama asked if Comey was saying that the NSC should not pass sensitive information related to Russia to Flynn. Comey replied 'potentially.'  He added that he has no indication thus far that Flynn has passed classified information to Kisylak, but he noted that 'the level of communication is unusual.'"

 Tokyo 2020 is now scheduled to take place from 23 July to 8 August next year after being delayed because of the coronavirus pandemic.
 Although, Mori disclosed that he haven't consulted the International Olympic Committee whether they would agree to such plan but he believes that given the situation at hand, Japan will have to review some key areas including the ceremonies.
 He also added that the Olympics and Paralympics - which will now run from 24 August to 5 September 2021 - could share opening and closing ceremonies as a way of cutting costs.

The situation is so dire that European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has urged member states to allow workers to come to their countries, treating fruit and vegetable pickers as essential.
 In Germany, developers have created a mobile app called Clever Ackern — German for "clever plowing" — to help fill the worker shortage on farms while also addressing unemployment in cities.
 "It's a platform where people, students, young people and people who just lost their jobs register and tell us their availability on the upcoming weeks and months to help farmers on their fields," app developer Fabian Höhne says.
 Before the coronavirus pandemic hit, Höhne ran a travel booking app that offered last-minute discounted airline tickets to students. With hardly anyone flying, he and his staff shifted gears and came up with the program connecting farmers and potential workers. The service is free of charge. Within days of launching in March, 40,000 people registered to become farm workers, the developer says.
 "I think the great weather, of course, is bringing people outside, and they're saying, 'OK, yeah, let's do something. Let's help,' " says Höhne.
 But farmer Garlipp is skeptical about the idea of city folks working in the fields, and he isn't convinced it is a good idea health-wise, either.
 "If I take on [Germans] to help with the harvest — assuming they're fit enough for the job — the problem I face is that they'll come from all over the region," Garlipp says. "I have no idea where these people have been or who they're mixing with at the end of the day, and the risk of [coronavirus] infection is much higher."
 Garlipp says he's received more than a hundred offers from Germans willing to help him on the farm, but it turns out he won't need their help. Thanks to the German government, his regular team of 80 Romanians is among those who will be allowed to bring in the harvest this year.

The trial of five men suspected of carrying out a vicious attack against a group of women leaving a nightclub in Geneva is underway in France. The prosecution would like to see the assailants put behind bars for five to 13 years, according to French news agency AFP.
 In the early hours of August 8, 2018, a group of men attacked a woman outside a nightclub in Geneva. Four women who tried to help the victim were also attacked. All five, aged 22-33, were taken to the hospital, two with serious injuries, one of whom ended up in a coma.
 The case sent shockwaves through Switzerland. The alleged assailants were later arrested in France and are now on trial at the French Criminal Court in Thonon-les-Bains, near the Swiss border.
 French prosecutor Etienne Moreau said the case hinges on testimonies and acknowledged "the question could arise as to whether we will know exactly what happened".
 He described the events outside the Geneva nightclub as a “war scene” of “unprecedented violence” with grave consequences for the victims.

MISSOULA, Mont. (KPAX/CNN) – Many people have had to find new ways to make money during the coronavirus pandemic.One woman in Montana used her sewing knowledge to create masks, which she’s now sending all over the country.Normally, Vida Anderson runs a daycare out of her home in east Missoula. But is anything really normal nowadays?When Montana Gov. Steve Bullock shut down schools in March due to COVID-19, Anderson and her husband knew they would probably need to put a halt to the daycare operation until at least June, and find another way to make ends meet in the meantime."We closed our daycare and kept our fingers crossed that we would be able to stay afloat until we could reopen," Anderson said.With years of sewing experience, and a demand across the country for protective masks, Anderson knew what she needed to do."Twenty days straight of sewing, 14 hours a day, no joke," she said.At the start, Anderson was coordinating mask-making and donations for a Facebook group called “Crafters Against COVID-19.”But once the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended masks be worn by everyone in public, she started selling them through her online crafting shop."And then it just kind of took off,” she said. “We were so busy we couldn't sew fast enough."Requests were soon coming in from all over the country."So, we've sent them a lot to New York, Brooklyn, the Bronx,” Anderson said. “We've sent them to Florida, Texas, Indiana, a lot to California, a lot to Seattle."Amid the chaos of what has now become a mass sewing operation, Anderson has enlisted the help of her two teenagers and her husband, making this time even more memorable for her than it already was."I taught my husband how to cut the fabric, get them all prepped that way,” she said. “I taught him how to surge, the first step, and then he has got carpal tunnel syndrome now from all the ironing."Mask by mask, Anderson is determined to get her family through the pandemic."The masks definitely have been a blessing, and they have kept us from having to go into our savings and kept us afloat without having to worry,” she said. “We went from being super worried to being super busy, and no time to worry."Copyright 2020 KPAX via CNN.

Tara Bettenhausen, a fifth-grade Cambridge 4-H member who was preparing to show a heifer at Jefferson County and a pig at the Stoughton Fair, said she had her doubts they would go on “but I still kept practicing with my animals to get them ready.”
 Grieser said word that the Dane County Fair was canceled was “really worrisome,” leaving her with little hope that Jefferson County would happen.
 “The thought of not having it was really sad...I just didn’t want to even think about it,” Grieser said. “(It’s) really great to hear, very relieving, that our work is actually going to be able to pay off.”
 Lake Ripley 4-H member Hanna Brattlie agreed. Brattlie said she only wants to go to the fair to “see her friends from the fair, and be able to exhibit.”
 “I don’t really care if there’s not a carnival, the food, all that doesn’t matter to me,” she said.
 The Brattlie family said their reaction to hearing the Jefferson County Fair was joy.
 “I was ecstatic, I was bouncing off the walls. I was so happy,” Rylee Brattlie said of hearing Jefferson County was on. “When I think of summer, I think of fair. That’s one of our most important things of summer.”
 With so many other activities called off for the coming summer, “this is the only thing they have left to look forward to,” said Joy Brattlie, Rylee and Hanna’s mother.
 Cambridge FFA advisor Emily Klingbeil said it’s “been stressful up until this point,” and that this is “good news.”
 “I think they’re eager for that feedback, on something they’ve been working so hard on,” Klingbeil said. “For lots of kids, their favorite week of the whole year, or favorite week of the whole summer, is fair week.”
 While both the Dane County and Stoughton Fairs will extend participation in the fair next year to anyone aging out this year, the cancelations are still being mourned. Grieser, a senior at Cambridge High School, is feeling the loss.
 “It’s my senior year, it’s just already a sad year because it’s my last year showing,” Grieser said. “All of my family members have done it...All of my friends are there. It’s the best week of the year.”
 “The fact that Jefferson County is going to try to put something together is really nice, because everyone does work so hard,” she continued.
 Whether the Jefferson County Fair will include a meat auction is “still the big question mark,” Klingbeil said.
 Without it, Grieser said, “all of these kids would be losing thousands of dollars.”
 Families have invested significant amounts of money into purchasing and caring for animals, Klingbeil said, agreeing that the potential lost investment is a concern.
 Kari Bettenhausen said her children, Tyce and Tara, each bought a pig they were planning to show at the Stoughton Fair. Now, the family is looking for a way to sell them. Both use their earnings from selling their pigs the previous year to fund next year’s projects, she said.
 “They support their animals and their projects all by themselves,” Bettenhausen said.
 Bettenhausen said they’re planning on holding a virtual pig sale for family, friends and local businesses, with Tyce as auctioneer. “Tyce, he would love to be an auctioneer someday,” Bettenhausen said.
 They are also considering showing their pigs in a virtual show on May 23 hosted by the Wisconsin Show Pig Association. She said Tyce is also hoping to show a pig at this year’s Wisconsin State Fair, if it happens. The State Fair is still scheduled for August.

With Oregon facing deep economic impacts due to COVID-19 shutdowns, furloughs continue to hit Eugene-Springfield school districts as administrators project millions of dollars in budget shortfalls for next year.
   
 Bethel School District will furlough staff one day a week until the end of the school year, spokesman Pat McGillivray announced late Tuesday night.
   
 Eugene School District also is looking to furlough staff for four or five days this school year, according to this Wednesday's school board documents amended Tuesday evening. The board will not vote whether to approve furloughs this week -- that decision will be made at a later meeting.
   
 The two districts' moves follow Springfield School Board's decision Monday to furlough staff each Friday through the end of the school year.
   
 Springfield Superintendent Todd Hamilton told the board that Gov. Kate Brown directed all state agencies to account for an 8.5% budget reduction each year across the board.
   
 At the time, the Department of Education projected a $656 million reduction to this biennium's budget, Hamilton said, which would leave serious deficits for districts. For Springfield, it poses a $11.7 million projected deficit.
   
 Eugene School District is bracing for a $17.5 million budget shortfall, according to board documents, and anticipates a decline in revenue from its local option levy due to a recession.
   
 4J administrators plan to approach the board at a future meeting with proposals for furloughs and the Work Share program, which provides employers an alternative to layoffs by having their employees eligible for unemployment insurance.
   
 Bethel faces the possibility of a $6.5 million budget cut, McGillivray said, which is why the district will furlough staff.
   
 "This could save close to $1 million that will be used next school year, helping to protect instructional days and staff positions," he stated.
   
 Bethel also will be part of Oregon's Work Share program.
   
 On the issue of distance learning, McGillivray said Bethel students should not notice significant changes to their routines. For most staff, the furloughs will be on Fridays, and teachers will condense their schedules and reduce staff meetings to fit the four-day work week.

NEW YORK -- As Americans plan for life after pandemic lockdowns, many want to avoid public transport and use a car instead, straining already underfunded transit systems and risking an increase in road congestion and pollution.
 Several opinion polls show Americans plan to avoid trains and buses as stay- at-home orders ease, with some city dwellers buying a car for the first time. A potential boon to coronavirus-battered automakers, the shift poses a challenge to city planners end environmental goals.
 Similar dynamics have played out in China, where transit ridership in large cities remains down about 35% two months after lockdown restrictions were lifted while car purchases increase.
 Ford Motor Co Chief Operating Officer Jim Farley said the company has seen an uptick in Chinese demand for higher-priced utility vehicles fueled by upscale office workers who used to take public transport.
 Volkswagen AG has also seen its sales in China rise above prior-year levels in the final week of April, driven by the desire to avoid public transport, according to Juergen Stackmann, in charge of VW's passenger car sales and marketing.
 Sales of passenger cars jumped 12.3% between April 20 and 25, according to China's Passenger Car Association
 Transit ridership has plummeted by as much as 95% in large U.S. cities during the pandemic and America's leading transit agencies forecast massive budget drops and revenue deficits well into 2022.
 They call for $33 billion in federal support in addition to the $25 billion they were granted as part of a March U.S. coronavirus stimulus bill.
 Transit agencies argue they are essential to a comprehensive economic recovery that avoids gridlock, but surveys show Americans plan to reduce their use of shared transportation.
 In an April Ipsos poll among U.S. transit riders, 72% said they would either reduce their use of public transportation or wait until it was safe again. That compared with 68% of U.S. consumers who said they will use their car as much or more than before the pandemic.
 In New York City, where some 5.5 million people commuted daily on subways and buses before the pandemic, residents are mulling their future transportation needs.
 Chana and Mordechai Lightstone, a couple living in Brooklyn with their five children, never owned a car, but in early April finally made a decision to buy a Honda Odyssey minivan.
 "We really prided ourselves on being subway people, but a car simply is the safest way to go outside right now," Chana Lightstone said.
 Some businesses, like the New York Stock Exchange, have told employees they are not allowed to take public transit to work.
 Mark Schienberg, president of the Greater New York Automobile Dealers Association, said his members in recent weeks frequently heard from customers concerned about taking transit to work.
 In a survey by online vehicle sales platform TrueCar, 8% of U.S. shoppers said avoiding public transportation was their primary reason for leasing or buying a car.
 But as more people switch from transit to cars, the risk of congestion increases, a team of U.S. researchers found. Modeling commutes in U.S. metropolitan areas, they found that individual commutes increase by as much as 20 minutes if one in four transit riders switches to a private car.
 "If officials fail to convince the public that public transportation is safe, we could see a permanent shift away from transit," said Dan Work, a professor at Vanderbilt University's School of Engineering and one of the study's co- authors.
 Trying to rebuild trust, U.S. transit officials look to Asia and Europe where cities instituted temperature checks, mandatory face coverings and in some instances try to enforce physical distancing by condoning off seats and sections on platforms.
 Cleaning and disinfection procedures for everything from ticket machines to elevator buttons and handrails have been implemented by all transit agencies. In New York City, those additional cleaning measures will cost up to $500 million per year.

 Italy Prime Minister, Giuseppe Conte has announced in the early hours of Monday that professional sport teams can resume training on May 18, while individual sports can resume on May 4.
 This move implies that the Italian top flight league, SerieA, could resume actions in June but matches will be played behind closed doors.
 Conte confirmed that beginning from Monday (today), "Sports Minister Vincenzo Spadafora will work intensely with the soccer system and the professional sports in general, to find a road map that have been partly defined in terms of the resumption of individual training on May 4 and teams on May 18." He said
 Italy is one of the Nations of the world where the Covid19 pandemic has wrecked more havoc with more than 2000 deaths recorded.
 As a result, Serie A has been suspended since March 9, when the government ordered a nationwide lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic.
 The Prime Minister further added "Being a big soccer fan like so many Italians, at the start it seemed strange to me that the season could be interrupted and suspended,"
 "But obviously we found ourselves involved in this health, social and economic emergency. And I think everyone, even the most ardent fans, understood that there wasn't any alternative."
 Meanwhile, twelve rounds of matches are left to be played in the suspended SerieA season, defending champions, Juve are one point clear of Lazio who sit second on the log.
 Also, the Coppa Italia was suspended after the first leg of the semi-finals.

Welcome to summer in Pentwater.
 For a tourist community, the pandemic has created particularly difficult challenges. Which businesses will re-open, and when? What events, if any, will there be? Will people still be able to gather and enjoy the village’s beloved attractions, like the beach or the channel? And most concerning, what will be the effect of the inevitable influx of summer people, for whom Pentwater has always been an eagerly anticipated oasis, but who now may bring an unwanted visitor with them—the coronavirus?
 “People are getting nervous,” admits Claudia Ressel-Hodan, president of the Pentwater Women’s Club and a member of the Pentwater Village Council and Downtown Development Authority. “When visitors come into town, they’re supposed to self-quarantine for two weeks. But I’m absolutely worried that they aren’t observing that requirement, which is difficult to enforce.”
 Ressel-Hodan says that if an establishment isn’t requiring patrons and employees to wear proper face coverings, she’ll steer clear of it, especially after a disconcerting experience she had recently.
 “I’m really disgusted that people aren’t wearing masks. The other day I went to the laundromat to wash my bed spread, and there was a man in there without a mask on. The place was empty and there were 13 dryers open and which one does he choose? The one next to me, of course!
 “Already we see too many people walking around without masks, and that’s an executive order. Again, how do you enforce it? Laude (Chief of Police Laude Hartrum) might be taking names and passing them on to the county prosecuting attorney. But he won’t be issuing tickets. He’s put up a sign that reads, ‘Obey Social Distancing.’ People are on their honor, and many will comply. But many won’t.”
 The energetic Ressel-Hodan, who at 66 is a peripatetic fixture in town, isn’t one to let anything get her down. For instance, she’s a lifelong cyclist who bikes an average of 15 miles a day; engineered the bicycle sharing program for Pentwater as a joint venture between the DDA and the Pentwater Police Department; started a weekly bike riding group; and is active in the Pentwater-Hart Bike Trail project. Two years ago, she set a local record of sorts when she bicycled to Milwaukee all by herself—with a torn meniscus. But even she admits that the coronavirus has given her pause.
 “My husband is 82 and has heart disease and respiratory issues,” she notes. “So, yes, I’m terrified of this virus. I’m staying put. I have groceries delivered. I’ll go out to ride my bike, but that’s it.”
 For Hartrum, the challenges the tourist season poses are many.
 “We’re trying to balance the governor’s executive orders with what people want to do,” the PPD chief notes. “Fortunately the vast majority of our visitors and residents are compliant. Because we’ve got minimal agencies that can enforce the rules, we’re limited. People call us with information about someone who just arrived here and who isn’t quarantining, for instance, but when you’ve got a limited number of officers, we rely on people complying voluntarily. What we’re doing is mainly reminding people of the rules, and answering questions when people call us.”
 Hartrum voices a number of concerns regarding the virus. “There’s no question in my mind that we’re going to get more cases in Oceana County,” he says.
 Is he nervous?
 “No,” he shrugs. “That’s the way it’s going to go, and we have to deal with it. But I’m concerned because while the state’s numbers are going down, Oceana, Mason and other counties in District 10 are going up. District 10 just reported 145 cases. Last week it was 57. But our medical resources have stayed the same.”
 Even more worrisome, he says, is the economic impact of the pandemic.
 “For a tourist town like Pentwater, it’s devastating. The businesses here have six weeks to make their money. Their very survival is at stake. What I’m dealing with are the business people who are stressed out, not knowing where their next dollars are coming from.”
 Hartrum is particularly concerned about the seniors who make up so much of Pentwater’s population.
 “We’ve got old people who are scared to go to the post office. Everybody goes to the post office for their mail. And I’ve been getting complaints about people not wearing their masks. The seniors are at a much higher risk of dying from the virus. People say, well, the flu is just as lethal. But what they don’t realize is, the flu kills X number of people over a 12-month period. This virus killed 50,000 in six weeks. And today, just a few weeks later, that number is nearly 100,000.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control issued a no-sail order to cruise companies on March 14. The CDC said infectious diseases can easily spread when crew members from a ship with an outbreak transfer to other ships. It notes outbreaks of COVID-19 on cruise ships also pose a risk because passengers can spread the disease into communities across the world after disembarkation.
 Shares of the three major cruise lines, Carnival, Royal Caribbean and Norwegian Cruise Lines, have plunged between 60% and 75% this year.
 Royal Caribbean Cruises suspended its global operations on March 13, a day before the CDC order went into effect, and was forced to cancel 130 cruises during the quarter. It plans to resume at least some cruises on June 12.
 “We understand that when our ships return to service, they will be sailing in a changed world," said CEO Richard Fain. "How well we anticipate and solve for this new environment will play a critical role in keeping our guests and crew safe and healthy.”
 On a per-share basis, the company lost of $6.91. Losses, adjusted for asset impairment costs and non-recurring costs, came to $1.48 per share. Projections from Wall Street analysts were all over the map, but Royal Caribbean fell short of almost all of them.
 Revenue was just over $2 billion down from more than $2.4 billion the in the same period last year.

Nine states have sued the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for curtailing enforcement of rules on air and water pollution during the COVID-19 pandemic, saying the pullback puts the public at even greater risk.
 The states accuse the federal regulator of overstepping its authority when it created a "blanket waiver" in March that they say "gives regulated parties free rein to self-determine when compliance with federal environmental laws is not practical because of COVID-19."
 That could tempt companies to stop reporting chemical spills or refrain from tracking emissions of hazardous air pollutants, such as sulfur dioxide or benzene, the states say in their complaint.
 The lawsuit, filed in federal court in New York City last week, asks the court to vacate the policy. It was filed by the nine Democratic state attorneys general from New York, California, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Oregon, Vermont and Virginia.
 Defendants include the EPA, Administrator Andrew Wheeler and Assistant Administrator Susan Parker Bodine.
 Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said Monday that the policy "puts Minnesota's most vulnerable communities even more at risk and denies them information about potential pollution that we know exacerbates symptoms of COVID-19."
 The EPA announced its temporary enforcement discretion policy March 26, three days after the American Petroleum Institute, a major oil and gas industry association, wrote the EPA asking it to "temporarily waiv(e) nonessential compliance obligations" during the pandemic, the lawsuit notes.
 The EPA move stunned environmental groups. A coalition led by the Natural Resources Defense Council sued the EPA, also in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.
 An EPA spokesperson said they can't comment on specific litigation, but said the agency has responded to the concerns of the state attorneys general.
 "The EPA temporary policy is a lawful and proper exercise of the agency's authority under extraordinary circumstances," the spokesperson said. "As we've stated previously, contrary to reporting, EPA's enforcement authority and responsibility remains active and the temporary guidance does not allow any increase in emissions. This is not a nationwide waiver of environmental rules."
 The Trump administration has been steadily undoing environmental regulations for years, rolling back more than 60 such rules, according to a New York Times tracker, with more in the works.
 In an interview, Alexandra Klass, who teaches environmental law at the University of Minnesota Law School, said that many of the rollbacks underwent a rule-making process with public notices and comments. The EPA's curtailment in March did not. "It just seemed to come out of nowhere," Klass said.

Whether by design or as a byproduct of our new habits, metadata and credits don't play a big role in modern music streaming services. We're frustrated when a service gets the title of a song wrong or reports the incorrect track sequence in an album, but we don't consider the fact that there's a world of context and additional information hidden behind the songs and albums we listen to every day. That context is entirely invisible to us because it's not mass-market enough for a music streaming service. There have been small updates on this front lately1, but by and large, credits and additional track information are still very much ignored by the streaming industry. And if you ask me, that's a shame.

Apparently magnetic eyelashes are a "thing."      I realized this when I started getting a suspicious number of Facebook ads for magnetic false eyelashes. I thought that maybe it was just me and Facebook had determined somehow that I was eyelash-challenged and in desperate need of a solution. But then I found out that my friends were also getting the same ads, so it seemed we were a nation of eyelash-deficient women who could only be saved from this crisis by fake magnetic eyelashes.      In the ads, women applied a magnetic eyeliner on their eyelids which created a magnetic field that attracted a pair of polar opposite eyelashes. This is actually more science than anyone who buys their makeup out of a sale bin at the drugstore needs to know. Supposedly, though, this is a much easier system for applying eyelashes than the old "glue-on and hope you don't glue your eyelids shut" method. I tried the old glue-on method once and the eyelashes came unglued, fell on my cheek, and then someone slapped me because it looked like I had a hairy caterpillar on my face.      After a while, the eyelash ads began to taper off. But then, suddenly, I started getting ads for a fortifying eyelash serum so I could grow out my own pathetic eyelashes and not have the need for magnetic ones. Not wanting to put anything potentially dangerous near my eyes (um, like magnets) I found out that the secret ingredient in this serum was … wait for it … seaweed kelp.      Now my husband had a choice between living with me 24/7 with either hairy caterpillars on my face or smelling like a fresh fish market all the time.      Wanting to make sure that I wasn't missing the boat here, I thought maybe I should check with my husband, the one person who might actually care what my eyelashes looked like and how my face smelled.      "Hey honey," I said. "Do you think I need better eyelashes?"      "Is that a trick question?" he asked. "Like, 'Do these pants make me look fat?'"      "No, I just want to make sure you don't feel let down by my skimpy lashes."      "You have beautiful eyelashes and those pants don't make you look fat," he said. "Am I safe now?"      Clearly, this is not the most important issue on the planet right now, which led me to wonder why someone would think it was so essential for me to have eyelashes of any length at this moment. I'm not going to be batting them at anybody while I'm in isolation. Seriously, who am I going to impress? My dog? He has no opinion on my eyelashes whatsoever. He just wants to know when he's going to be fed, and doesn't care if I have fabulous eyelashes when I serve him his kibble.      With all this attention being paid to my eyelashes, I wondered if this was indicative of a larger beauty problem that had escaped my attention. Honestly, I didn't think I was letting myself go. I still shaved my legs and did my nails and even occasionally put on some makeup when I planned to Facetime with someone and I didn't want to scare their children if they happened to glance at the screen. So, overall, I didn't think I needed magnetic eyelashes or eyelash seaweed serum. What I did need to do was have a talk with customer service at Facebook and tell them they should focus on what's really important.      My eyebrows.

According to author and teacher Marianne Williamson, "Ego says, 'Once everything falls into place, I’ll feel peace.' Spirit says, 'Find your peace, and then everything will fall into place.'" I think the coming weeks will be a favorable time for you to take Williamson's advice seriously, Virgo. How? By giving control of your life to Spirit as you find your peace. In saying this, I'm not implying that Ego is bad or wrong. In fact, I think Ego is a crucial asset for you, and I'm hoping that in recent months you have been lifting your Ego to a higher, finer state of confidence and competence than ever before. But right now I think you should authorize Spirit to run the show for a while. If you do, it will bless you with good surprises.

First there was "The Trip," a six-part, three-hour BBC TV series with Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon playing Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon ... or at least fairly close versions of themselves. The show presented them as friends or, more accurately, close acquaintances who, between acting jobs, got a writing assignment to drive through the north of England, hop from hotel to hotel, and eat lunches in fancy restaurants, then report on the experiences. The charm of the whole thing was captured in their conversations, most involving history and pop culture and any topic imaginable practically in between. The charm of that charm was in full flower when the discussions started including impersonations of celebrities - Michael Caine and Sean Connery among them - and an ever-spiraling sense of competition between the two guys over who could do the better one.      It was a wonderfully entertaining and meandering series of half-hour shows which were eventually edited into the feature film "The Trip." Which begat the series and the movies "The trip to Italy" and "The Trip to Spain," and has now resulted in the fourth and supposedly final installment, "The Trip to Greece." More driving, hotels, restaurants, conversation and imitations.      But the shows and films haven't been just a lot of goofiness. In and around all of the talking, viewers have been treated to two spot-on improvisors - and gifted imitators - who are operating with all pistons firing, and are regularly and successfully trying to crack each other up. But there's much more, and credit goes to the creator and director Michael Winterbottom, who has seamlessly instilled a serious side of things, a sense of gravitas, that keeps everything in balance.      These are comedies, but wrapped up inside them are personal issues that reveal what's making these characters tick. Truth be told, Coogan and Brydon are so good at this sort of thing, it's very difficult to pinpoint where the real people and their characters diverge. In previous entries, there have been looks at the relationship between Coogan and his son (Tim Leach) and the relationship between Brydon and his wife (Rebecca Johnson), and not all has been rosy. In "The Trip to Greece," the thin plotline brings in heartfelt and serious thoughts of mortality.      But, yes, it's still a comedy, and although Coogan and Brydon present it as a continuation of what they've done before, they make sure to infuse it with a breath of freshness. As does Winterbottom.      The director chose Greece partially because of the country's beauty, but also because of its history and its myths. The route he puts his protagonists on distantly mirrors the one taken by Odysseus in "The Odyssey." The actors - driving and eating and chattering away - let pieces of their real lives seep into their discussions, and they up the ante in the impressions competition (my favorites include a meeting between Stan Laurel - who Coogan played in the film "Stan & Ollie" \- and Tom Hardy, and one involving British actor Ray Winstone if he were to play Henry VIII) and, this time, even get into a physical contest over a swimming challenge.      As in the previous TV shows and films, there are six lunches, brief peeks - in extreme close-up - of the meals being prepared in restaurant kitchens, and visits by a couple of women from their publication. One of the odder things about all of this is that neither Coogan nor Brydon seem all that knowledgeable about the food they eat or the wine they drink. Or maybe that's just how they're playing the parts. But they certainly come across as an educated, well read pair of travelers with both shared and completely different interests in what they're seeing and talking about.      If this does turn out to be the final "Trip" film, that'll be too bad, because these have always been a joy to return to. But it also makes sense to end it here, as the Odysseus story is about going on and ending an extended voyage. To be sure, this has been a funny, thoughtful, long, strange one.      "The Trip to Greece" will be available on cable and digital VOD starting May 22.      Ed Symkus can be reached at esymkus@rcn.com.

 With Oregon facing deep economic impacts due to COVID-19 shutdowns, furloughs continue to hit Eugene-Springfield school districts as administrators project millions of dollars in budget shortfalls for next year.
 Bethel School District will furlough staff one day a week until the end of the school year, spokesman Pat McGillivray announced late Tuesday night.
 Eugene School District also is looking to furlough staff for four or five days this school year, according to this Wednesday's school board documents amended Tuesday evening. The board will not vote whether to approve furloughs this week -- that decision will be made at a later meeting.
 The two districts' moves follow Springfield School Board's decision Monday to furlough staff each Friday through the end of the school year.
 Springfield Superintendent Todd Hamilton told the board that Gov. Kate Brown directed all state agencies to account for an 8.5% budget reduction each year across the board.
 At the time, the Department of Education projected a $656 million reduction to this biennium's budget, Hamilton said, which would leave serious deficits for districts. For Springfield, it poses a $11.7 million projected deficit.
 Eugene School District is bracing for a $17.5 million budget shortfall, according to board documents, and anticipates a decline in revenue from its local option levy due to a recession.
 4J administrators plan to approach the board at a future meeting with proposals for furloughs and the Work Share program, which provides employers an alternative to layoffs by having their employees eligible for unemployment insurance.
 Bethel faces the possibility of a $6.5 million budget cut, McGillivray said, which is why the district will furlough staff.
 \"This could save close to $1 million that will be used next school year, helping to protect instructional days and staff positions,\" he stated.
 Bethel also will be part of Oregon's Work Share program.
 On the issue of distance learning, McGillivray said Bethel students should not notice significant changes to their routines. For most staff, the furloughs will be on Fridays, and teachers will condense their schedules and reduce staff meetings to fit the four-day work week.

HONG KONG (AP) — It took only a few seconds. Shortly after I stepped off a flight from Singapore, an official at the Hong Kong immigration counter gestured for me to extend my arm, then strapped a bulky plastic box to my wrist. And just like that, I had a new companion for the next 14 days of self-isolation — a government quarantine tracker. In online pictures, the trackers were inconspicuous devices almost like a concert wristband. Those didn't look so bad. What I got, though, was a gadget about the size of a deck of cards that I had to pair with a government quarantine app. After that, if I left my home or stepped more than 30 feet from my phone for a prolonged period of time, the app would alert authorities that I may have broken quarantine. The bulky tracker turned out to be a new version released after Hong Kong admitted that only a third of the first-generation wristbands actually worked. The rest simply never activated. On the taxi ride home, I examined it closely. The tracker hardly looked like a high-tech device meant to keep tabs on me. It was so light that I wondered if maybe it was an empty shell, a cheap fake to trick me into staying put. I wasn't about to take it off to find out, even though having a tracker branded me as a potential risk to society, at least for two weeks. I found myself trying to hide it when I arrived at my apartment building, afraid others might see and shun me. Over the next two weeks, I wore the tracker in the shower, while exercising, and of course to sleep. Sometimes I'd forget about it entirely. At other moments, the constant presence on my wrist was all I could feel, a perpetual reminder that I was a virtual prisoner in my home. It did make a handy conversation starter. When I showed it off at a friend’s Zoom birthday...

That decision by the GOP to remain in session angered Rep. Arlando Teller, D-Chinle, who pointed out that the Navajo Nation has the highest per capita infection rate in the country.
 “Over 150 of my family and my relatives are either six feet under or in the process for a casket to be processed so that we can pay our respects,’’ he said.
 And Minority Leader Charlene Fernandez, D-Yuma, chided colleagues for voting on changes in state oversight of college savings programs. She said what her constituents need is food. It’s not that Democrats want to go home. Instead, they want a special session to focus only on virus-related issues, including increasing the maximum benefit under the state’s unemployment compensation law. It is capped at $240 a week, the second lowest figure in the nation.
 The divide between Republicans and Democrats over COVID-19 was pointed up by the fact that only a handful of Republicans were wearing masks; all the Democrats had their faces covered. “We know that a person who is speaking without a mask is sending out vaporized virus in their breath, no less than six feet,’’ said Rep. Diego Rodriguez, D-Phoenix. “To pretend otherwise is irresponsible.’’
 The fight that erupted on the House floor on Tuesday has been brewing for weeks, ever since the GOP majority refused to follow the lead of the Senate and shut down. At the same time, though, there has been some finger pointing about what is taking so long to wrap up the session.
 In a message to colleagues, House Majority Leader Warren Petersen, R-Gilbert, said the chamber could wrap up all the loose ends by Thursday -- “or if the Dems are turds we come in Friday to wrap up.’’
 And Petersen set the stage for the talking points.
 “We need to constantly push the narrative that the Ds are stalling and keeping AZ society from getting back to normal as needed,’’ he wrote. That played out on the floor as House Speaker Rusty Bowers, R-Mesa, called the Democrats a “party of fear.’’ And he noted the hit the state’s economy has taken from the virus and the governor’s orders telling people to stay home and limiting what businesses could operate. Most of those directives are now gone.
 Bowers acknowledged that there are people who are not ready to resume their pre-COVID activities.
 “Please, stay home,’’ he said. “Wait until you’re confident, then start coming out.’’ But that, he said, cannot be the attitude for the entire state. “For the majority of Arizonans, especially those with businesses, they need to get back to work,’’ Bowers said.

 Jadon Sancho's transfer to Manchester United is up in the air following Ed Woodward's latest comment that the transfer market could be irreversibly changed by the coronavirus outbreak.
 United has been in pursuit of the English youngster but the deal may suffer hiccups going by the words of the club's Vice Chairman, Ed Woodward.
 According to Woodward, the days of mega-money transfer are over and that could include United's move for the 20-year-old Borussia Dortmund forward who is expected to cost at least £100Million.
 Woodward revealed this during the forum meeting which was done through a conference call "As ever, our priority is the success of the team, but we need visibility of the impact across the whole industry, including timings of the transfer window, and the wider financial picture, before we can talk about a return to normality."
 "On this basis, I cannot help feeling that speculation around transfers of individual players for hundreds of millions of pounds this summer seems to ignore the realities that face the sport."
 Sancho currently has two years remaining on his deal with Dortmund and it is hard to imagine German giants letting their star go this summer for less than a nine-figure fee, which means that United may miss out on their priority target.
 Meanwhile, The Red Devils have also been linked with Tottenham ace attacker, Harry Kane,in a fee understood to be around £200M but both moves have been thrown into uncertainty by the Vice-chairman's latest comments.

Tara Reid has admitted the coronavirus lockdown is putting a strain on her relationship with boyfriend Nathan Montpetit-Howar.
 The 44-year-old actress went public with her relationship with the music producer last September, just months before social distancing measures were put in place in a bid to curb the spread of COVID-19.
 And in an interview with In Touch magazine, Tara revealed it's been "tough" for both her and Nathan to adjust to being with one another 24/7.
 "It is a make or break kind of thing because you're always together and we argue because there's no break, but we're getting through it," she said. "I think you've just got to check each other's feelings and try to give each other as much space as you possibly can, like when I'm doing business I want space, and when he's doing business, he wants space so we go into different rooms."
 In a bid to keep their romance in a happy place, the couple try to make their daily chores fun, and also enjoy binge-watching TV shows together, with the Sharknado star revealing Vikings is her new favourite.

"I've started looking into the effects the previous recession had on recent graduates at the time," Leslie said. "A lot of what I found is people say, 'Well I didn't get to really start my career or get that dream job that I really wanted to until three or four years after I graduated.'"
 Leslie lost her summer internship with a real estate company that she had hoped would be a springboard into the FinTech world, so she is one of those searching for Plan B, or C or D.
 Some employers have been able to honor job and internship offers, and some colleges are stepping up their efforts too.
 In Maine, small liberal arts Colby College launched a "Pay It Northward" program, promising to find jobs for all 500 new graduates, with the help of the school's alumni.
 "I get it, it's a tough market out there," said Colby President Dave Greene. They decided to ask alums and more prominent "super alums" to network and help out. "It was really a driving force to see, how do we get these students to graduate and be on their very best foot forward."
 After 10 days, the college said there have been hundreds of responses and more than 500 positions offered, about half of them full-time jobs. "They've been pouring in," Greene said. "I never expected that to happen so quickly."
 He encourages other institutions to help their graduates too. "I think we can all do our very best to help these students, they just need a little bit of a leg up right now," he said. "There's a lot of evidence that those students who end up underemployed when they first come out of college can end up being depressed in their wages for 10, 15 years or more. So, if we can give them a little bit of a boost right now to get them to jobs that they could really do the best in, they'll be fine."
 Don't write off the Class of 2020 just yet. The current crisis has graduates like Sanning and Leslie more determined than ever.
 "I applied to jobs in Cincinnati, Charlotte, Memphis, Kentucky, Florida," Sanning said. "I'm willing to drive as far as Seattle, Washington, to anybody that will hire me because I'm willing to start from the ground up and do whatever they need."
 Now that her internship has fallen through, Leslie will likely move back home and, at least for now, live with her mother.
 "Years from now, decades from now, whenever we all reflect back, we will all have this common shared experience," she said. "You will always be able to say 'Oh, you're class of 2020. I know what happened.'"

 “It is expected that the investment [will] improve outcomes for the communities of Cleveland through the availability of extra data to the force to help prevent and detect crime.

 In order to help clubs cope when club football returns, The world football governing, FIFA has proposed a five man substitution for teams in a maximum of three slots, plus half time.
 According to reports, the proposal is awaiting approval from the law making body of the International Football Association (IFAB). It is then in the prerogative of every organizers of different competitions across Europe whether to implement it or not.
 "When competitions resume, such competitions are likely to face a congested match calendar with a higher-than-normal frequency of matches played in consecutive weeks," a Fifa spokesperson said.
 "Safety of the players is one of Fifa's main priority then. One concern in this regard is that the higher-than-normal frequency of matches may increase the risk of potential injuries due to a resulting player overload.
 "In light of this and in light of the unique challenge faced globally in delivering competitions according to the originally foreseen calendar, Fifa proposes that a larger number of substitutions be temporarily allowed at the discretion of the relevant competition organiser.
 However, the temporary change on substitutes would be applied in competitions which are due to be completed in 2020 or 2021. It will also cover all national team matches up to and including 31 December 2021.

All of this will make for poetry on a balance sheet, but the true believers expect there will be a price to pay far into the future. If baseball is losing its grip on young fans, as it appears to be, taking it out of the towns where it brings life to summer evenings will not help. The minor league system as we have known it has made the game real, brought it close enough to touch for young kids in Appalachia, in the remote Rocky Mountain regions, in Rust Belt towns that have seen better days. That will be lost if the “Dream League” component of this grand scheme doesn’t fly. Fewer minor league teams can only make it harder to win young fans, to make them fans for life.
 But, sigh, nothing, and certainly not baseball, stays the same. Knowing the history, this is not the first time the minor leagues have been condensed. Time was, there were far more levels and leagues than there are now — all the way down to Class D, with the Yankees, Dodgers and Cardinals fielding 30 farm teams or more. Those days are trapped in old microfilm, and now minor league baseball as we’ve known it will be gone, too. Thanks to the coronavirus, we won’t get the chance to say goodbye.

BRASILIA -- Brazil's Health Ministry on Wednesday issued new guidelines for wider use of anti-malarial drugs for mild coronavirus cases, a treatment touted by President Jair Bolsonaro in defiance of public health experts warning of possible health risks.
 Interim Health Minister Eduardo Pazuello, an active duty army general, authorized the new guidelines after two trained doctors left the ministry's top job under pressure to promote early use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine.
 Medical experts warn that studies have not confirmed the effectiveness of the drugs in treating the novel coronavirus, including Marcos Espinal, director for communicable diseases at the Pan American Health Organization.
 "Our recommendations are crystal clear that they should not be used yet and in fact studies are suggesting a higher rate of secondary effects and cardiological problems in people who use it," Espinal told journalists in a Tuesday briefing.
 Bolsonaro has pushed the drugs' potential along with his ideological ally U.S. President Donald Trump, who said this week he was taking hydroxychloroquine preventively despite a warning from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
 Brazil's federal guidelines had previously cited the drugs only as an unproven treatment for severe cases of the COVID-19 respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus.
 The new guidelines suggest dosage for the anti-malarials along with the antibiotic azithromycin at the first onset of symptoms. Patients will have to sign a waiver recognizing potential side effects caused by the medicine.
 Brazil's evolving stance comes as Bolsonaro has also drawn criticism for playing down the seriousness of the pandemic and fighting against state governments' social isolation orders.
 Brazil's daily death toll from the outbreak jumped to a record 1,179 on Tuesday, with more confirmed cases than any country but Russia and the United States.

PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — With two state-run beaches about to reopen in time for Memorial Day, some Rhode Island communities are making plans to open municipally-run beaches that were closed because of the coronavirus pandemic. Newport is planning to open Easton’s Beach on or around June 4, City Manager Joseph Nicholson told the City Council during its weekly COVID-19 update Tuesday. A reopening plan had been in the works and that plan fell in line with the state guidelines regarding beaches, Nicholson said according to The Newport Daily News. Under that plan, parking capacity for the month of June would be capped at 33% and no bathrooms or showers will be available at first. The Middletown Town Council this week voted to reopen Third Beach as of Saturday, but with limitations, including that only town residents will be allowed at first. Third Beach’s boat ramp and parking areas have been closed to the public since early April, but people are still allowed to walk on the beach. Gov. Gina Raimondo announced this week that East Matunuck Beach in South Kingstown and Scarborough Beach in Narragansett will be open with free but limited parking starting Monday.

The UNHCR estimates the number of deaths in 2020 to be 182 but recognizes a death toll of 20 000 since the beginning of the migrant crisis in 2014. Unhappy with the lack of accountability for the magnitude of the crisis, civil society organisations have taken it upon themselves to give a closer look at the actual number of casualties.

Nine states have sued the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for curtailing enforcement of rules on air and water pollution during the COVID-19 pandemic, saying the pullback puts the public at even greater risk.
   
 The states accuse the federal regulator of overstepping its authority when it created a "blanket waiver" in March that they say "gives regulated parties free rein to self-determine when compliance with federal environmental laws is not practical because of COVID-19."
   
 That could tempt companies to stop reporting chemical spills or refrain from tracking emissions of hazardous air pollutants, such as sulfur dioxide or benzene, the states say in their complaint.
   
 The lawsuit, filed in federal court in New York City last week, asks the court to vacate the policy. It was filed by the nine Democratic state attorneys general from New York, California, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Oregon, Vermont and Virginia.
   
 Defendants include the EPA, Administrator Andrew Wheeler and Assistant Administrator Susan Parker Bodine.
   
 The EPA announced its temporary enforcement discretion policy March 26, three days after the American Petroleum Institute, a major oil and gas industry association, wrote the EPA asking it to "temporarily waiv(e) nonessential compliance obligations" during the pandemic, the lawsuit notes.
   
 The EPA move stunned environmental groups. A coalition led by the Natural Resources Defense Council sued the EPA, also in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.
   
 An EPA spokesperson said they can't comment on specific litigation, but said the agency has responded to the concerns of the state attorneys general.
   
 "The EPA temporary policy is a lawful and proper exercise of the agency's authority under extraordinary circumstances," the spokesperson said. "As we've stated previously, contrary to reporting, EPA's enforcement authority and responsibility remains active and the temporary guidance does not allow any increase in emissions. This is not a nationwide waiver of environmental rules."
   
 The Trump administration has been steadily undoing environmental regulations for years, rolling back more than 60 such rules, according to a New York Times tracker, with more in the works.
   
 In an interview, Alexandra Klass, who teaches environmental law at the University of Minnesota Law School, said that many of the rollbacks underwent a rule-making process with public notices and comments. The EPA's curtailment in March did not. "It just seemed to come out of nowhere," Klass said.

 \- Commends Federal, State govts on strategies adopted in containment of pandemic
 The former Deputy Governor of Imo State, Prince Eze Madumere and founding member of All Progressives Congress (APC) has called for understanding among the Nigerians, warning against politicization of the Covid - 19 pandemic.
 Prince Madumere made the statement on Thursday, while advising against the growing politicization of the ravaging pandemic in the polity.
 While extolling the understanding at the National Assembly, he called on politicians and political parties in different states to unite in the battle against the dreaded novel coronavirus.
 He insisted that there must transparency no matter who is involved, saying that attempt to entertain any form of secrecy in the the management of the pandemic will spell disaster.
 His words: "I commend the Federal government led by President Mohammadu Buhari and State governments for their effort towards containing the dreaded global pandemic, Covid - 19. My advise is that the pandemic must not be politicised. COVID -19 is a common enemy to humanity. This is the reason we must unite against it.
 "For those commissioned to manage the pandemic, I urge them to be as transparent as they can and within the international best practices. They must dance to the tune of politicians. No right thinking should use the pandemic as a political tool. It is time for us to unite and work together to fight our common enemy, which is novel Coronavirus.
 Prince Madumere also commended good spirited Nigerians who have made generous donations for the poor. He also called on those concerned with the distribution to ensure a fair deal. He warned against sharing what is meant for the poor to patronise political loyalists, saying that such attitude comes with curse of unimaginable magnitude.

She told me that she felt that the timing was actually _right_ , and that village residents would rally behind a business actually opening, instead of closing due to the pandemic.

The councillor is urging people to take safety precautions and look out for their vulnerable neighbours. Coun Connor said: "When I found out about this it was heartbreaking - now these elderly residents are living in fear.
 "It was so brazen and it appears to be targeted because almost all the residents of Stanrose Close are elderly. Every burglary was taking advantage of someone in their 80s or 90s.
 "One woman was pushed into the sideboard by the burglar. Her arm is black and blue now, that is somebody's grandma. She called her neighbour to warn her that there had been an intruder, and then the burglar appeared in her neighbour's home."
 "Living on your own, you are going to be thinking about that all the time now - it becomes a knot in your stomach."

Così vogliono ripartire gli operatori, spinti dalle richieste di prenotazione pervenute all'indomani della fine del lockdown con la consapevolezza che sarà un'estate da «sold out» complice anche la riduzione dei viaggi fuori regione. «Abbiamo raccomandato a tutti i nostri associati di non alzare i prezzi, nonostante la riduzione dei posti. Sappiamo che è dura far rientrare i bilanci e che le realtà sul territorio sono variegate, ma ci teniamo a tutelare la clientela spiega Salvatore Trinchillo, vice presidente nazionale del SIB, il Sindacato Italiano Balneari Confcommercio, che nell'area flegreo-giuglianese conta circa 50 iscritti . Siamo in attesa delle linee guida definitive visto che quelle dell'Inail erano inapplicabili. Al momento siamo su una distanza tra un ombrellone e l'altro di 3,15 metri per uno spazio di ingombro di 10 metri quadrati e su questo punto abbiamo chiesto di scendere sotto ai nove. Ci sono zone in cui queste distanze vengono già rispettate, mentre in altre no anche a causa di una diversità della costa: l'area domitia, ad esempio, ha spazi molto estesi, meno Arco Felice e Lucrino».

In a recent poll conducted by Loyola Marymount, the Mexican star was named as the third most popular athlete in Los Angeles behind only Lakers superstar James and Dodgers slugger Cody Bellinger. The Lakers and Dodgers are two of America's most iconic franchises, while Vela's Los Angeles FC have existed for less than three seasons. In those three short seasons, Vela has become a defining figure in Los Angeles and American soccer as a whole.

Some dinosaurs may have been faster, but T.rex would have been able to keep a slower but steadier pace, outlasting the speedier animals, who would just grow tired. Slow and steady wins the race, but who knew that applied to a T.rex?

La Orquesta Sinfónica de Euskadi vuelve a ensayar con nuevas medidas sanitarias para evitar al coronavirus al estar en la fase 1 de la desescalada. Ahora solo acuden a las sesiones la mitad de los músicos miembros y disponen de mamparas de separación entre ellos. La última actuación de la formación fue el 9 de marzo en Estambul. Ahora, tras dos meses sin poder reunirse y de tener que cancelar las últimas actuaciones de la temporada, la orquesta, una de las primeras en Europa en regresar y la primera en España en hacerlo, ha retomado su actividad adaptada a las actuales circunstancias debido al coronavirus. La disposición clásica de una sinfónica cambia su aspecto y sus protagonistas se habitúan estos días a los cambios. Estas medidas han supuesto que sus componentes tengan que aprender a interpretar la música de una manera diferente a la habitual debido al coronavirus. Se toma la temperatura de sus miembros a la entrada del recinto por el coronavirus, está prohibido el uso de los camerinos y es obligatorio el uso de las mascarillas hasta llegar al escenario donde la depositan en el atril hasta finalizar en ensayo. La Sinfónica no pudo terminar la temporada. Suspendió cerca de 30 conciertos a causa del coronavirus. Aún así, se ha mantenido activa durante el confinamiento a través de las redes sociales donde han publicado varias interpretaciones conjuntas de sus músicos desde sus casas.

HONG KONG (AP) — Hong Kong’s last British governor, Chris Patten, on Wednesday urged protesters not to “lose faith” over what he described as moves by Beijing to tighten its control over the semi-autonomous city. The former British colony was returned to China in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” framework that gives it its own legal system and more freedoms than on the mainland. It has been rocked over the past year by huge rallies that exposed deep divisions between democracy-minded Hong Kongers and the Communist Party-ruled central government in Beijing. The protests began over a now- withdrawn bill that would have allowed Hong Kong residents to be sent to the mainland for trial, and continued for more than seven months over police conduct and perceptions that Beijing is tightening its controls over the city’s affairs. The demonstrations, which were largely peaceful at first, over the months descended into occasionally violent clashes between police and protesters. More than 8,000 arrests were made. “They shouldn’t lose heart, they shouldn’t lose their sense of dignity and decency and moderation,” Patten said in an online interview organized by The Foreign Correspondents’ Club in Hong Kong. “I don’t think you can kill or lock up or tear gas into submission the idea of freedom,” said Patten, who was Hong Kong’s last colonial governor before the city was returned to China and helped negotiate the terms of the handover. He has often been critical of developments in Hong Kong since then, saying the terms were violated. Hong Kong's police force has been accused of excessive use of force during the demonstrations. Protesters have thrown gasoline bombs in retaliation and occupied streets and college campuses, turning them into...
