Born in Sao Paulo and given his professional chance further south on Brazil's eastern coast at Avai on the resort of Florianopolis, Gabriel continued his soccer apprenticeship in Europe with loan spells at northeast French club Troyes and Dinamo Zagreb in Croatia. Having spent the last 18 months impressing for Lille in France's Ligue 1, the center back has packed in a lot -- at the age of 22 -- before landing the first major move of his career with a $35 million transfer to Arsenal. The English club has tracked Gabriel for some time and sees him as a long-term fix for the defense, with the fact that he's left-footed an added attraction for a player who is composed on the ball and cool under pressure. The defense is being remodelled under Mikel Arteta and it requires players who are brave in possession. Gabriel will play alongside compatriot and fellow center back David Luiz, which should help him settle.

The Columbia City Council urged further and more aggressive enforcement of Columbia’s virus prevention efforts Tuesday as it unanimously voted to authorize Health Director Stephanie Browning to extend the most recent COVID-19 directive beyond its expiration date of Sept. 17 if she finds it necessary.
 The order requires bars and restaurants that serve alcohol to stop serving drinks at 9 p.m. and to close by 10 p.m. It also restricts gatherings to no more than 20 people unless a plan is filed with and approved by the Columbia/Boone County Department of Public Health and Human Services.
 Council members floated several ideas for more aggressively combatting the spread of the virus. Mayor Brian Treece wants Columbia to have “no-barrier testing,” which would allow people to get tested without needing insurance or a doctor’s order.
 “If we’re not going to do surveillance testing, I think we do need to increase the opportunities for no questions asked, no physician referral, no-barrier testing,” Treece said.
 Fourth Ward Councilman Ian Thomas urged the city to follow suggestions from the White House, including the closure of bars and gyms. His other suggestions included creating outdoor dining opportunities, limiting social gatherings to 10 or fewer people and instituting weekly testing in assisted living and long- term care facilities.
 “I love going to bars ... and I’ve missed it tremendously over the last many months, but I think that following these recommendations is the best way to get back to the kind of life we had,” Thomas said.
 Browning updated the council on the city’s COVID-19 prevention efforts. She agreed with Thomas that regular testing at nursing homes could be beneficial but said she has seen no data reflecting transmission of the virus through gyms.
 Pressed by council members to pursue more aggressive strategies to slow the spread of the virus, Browning said any move toward shutting down businesses again would need broad support, especially given that others cities and county's in Missouri aren't moving in that direction.
 “I’d say that’s a larger community conversation,” Browning said. “For the public health director to get up there and close things down again, it needs to have a lot more conversation than just me.”
 Browning agreed with Treece that no-barrier testing would be ideal. She said the best strategies going forward are to test as many people as possible and for people to change their behavior by wearing masks, avoiding large gatherings and quarantining when they test positive or have had close contact with those who have.
 "We are our best hope," she said.
 Delays in contact tracing were the primary concern of Sixth Ward Councilwoman Betsy Peters, who said she'd like to see a turnaround time of 24 to 48 hours rather than the five to seven days it now takes on average to notify people whether they've had close contact with a person who tested positive.
 Although the Health Department and MU have contact tracing teams working in tandem, Browning said MU’s team is understaffed and unable to deal with the recent rise in student cases.
 Browning said the Health Department has been monitoring downtown and noticed activity slowing down. She said there is a chance of a spike again soon following Labor Day weekend and the following couple weeks.
 Boone County reported 1,055 active COVID-19 cases as of Tuesday afternoon, with cases in the age 18 to 22 range surging since students returned to MU. Browning told the council that the county also is seeing significant spikes in positive cases among older age groups.

DENNIS -- General manager John Terrio Jr. and his staff at Chapin's Bayside have taken to calling this the "Summer of Survival."
 The restaurant next to Mayflower Beach was busy this summer, Terrio said, despite the coronavirus pandemic and the rules imposed by the Baker administration that caused it to shift from air-conditioned dining rooms to a tent in a parking lot behind the restaurant. Customers, wary of warnings about COVID-19 transmission indoors, wanted to be outside even during the region's insufferable August heat waves.
 "We were very fortunate there was not a lot of rain this summer," Terrio said.
 The dip in customers during last week's rain and fall-like temperatures showed him how critical good weather was to outdoor dining, and he prayed for a return to summer conditions through autumn to add much-needed revenue.
 "With a year like this, we don't want to leave anything on the table," he said. "I'm trying to make sure our staff has money in their pocket to survive (the winter). We can't afford to lose them, because they are the backbone."
 In the spring, people will put up with cold and clouds to dine outside in 50-degree weather, because it's comparably warmer than winter, said Janet Demetri, who has owned the Friendly Fisherman in North Eastham for 31 years. The restaurant offers only outdoor dining, and Demetri said the same hardiness does not apply to late summer and fall.
 "September with 55 degrees, no one will sit outside," she said.
 In New England, it is notoriously difficult to predict the weather. The one- month outlook for the Northeast is a crapshoot, with an equal chance of above, below or normal temperatures and precipitation, according to the National Climate Center. The three-month forecast is for a 60% to 70% chance of above- normal temperatures and a coin toss on precipitation.
 "People want to dine outside, and people will cancel when the weather is not conducive," said Peter Troutman, co-owner of the Scargo Cafe in Dennis. "I expect when the weather changes, we will see a downturn in business."
 The weather and tourist income this summer kept the wolf from the door for many Cape restaurants that adapted to the new reality.
 "We do believe that business on Cape Cod and the Islands has been stronger than in Boston and other areas of the state ... but no one is killing it," said Robert Luz, executive director of the Massachusetts Restaurant Association.
 Cape Cod Commission Executive Director Kristy Senatori said that in an ongoing survey of the business community 86% of Cape businesses, represented by 371 respondents, said they relied on people coming into their establishments. Fifty-five percent of businesses reported being open in a limited capacity, and 8% said they did not reopen at all this summer.
 Although Luz did not have numbers broken out by region, the outlook is bleak for the restaurant industry as a whole. His data shows that 23% of restaurants statewide did not reopen when Gov. Charlie Baker allowed outdoor dining only at the beginning of June and limited indoor dining a couple of weeks later. Luz anticipates that a muted -- and in places like Boston, a disastrous -- summer will be the final blow for an estimated 3,400 restaurants of the 16,000 that were open statewide March 1.
 "We're hoping that by next summer there is a change because of a vaccine, herd immunity, the virus dying out naturally," said Scargo Cafe co-owner David Troutman. "Sadly, I think there will be a lot less competition next spring after a number of (restaurant) failures."
 The well-known Japanese restaurant Inaho in Yarmouth Port is not contemplating closure, co-owner Alda Watanabe said. But navigating the ever-changing COVID-19 landscape has not been easy, even with 35 years of experience.
 "When we first opened (the restaurant at its current site), it was a challenge," Watanabe said. "But this is more; every day is a challenge."
 Watanabe and her husband, chef Yuji Watanabe, reopened in June with only takeout. Later in the season they decided to resume indoor dining at 50% capacity with plexiglass panels between tables, but the cozy confines of a historical Cape-style building worked against them. Even regular customers were concerned.
 "We saw old faces come in once, and wouldn't see them again. People felt unsafe," she said.
 The Watanabes also were concerned about the safety and health of their staff, and they reverted to takeout only.
 Terrio, Watanabe and the Troutmans said the stress of handling a robust takeout service alongside on-premises dining took its toll on workers. Like many other restaurants, Chapin's suffered from low staffing, due in part to cuts to student work visa and temporary work visa programs by the Trump administration, and to the federal $600 boost to unemployment payments that many restaurants said kept some local workers on the sidelines. Alda Watanabe said she saw valuable staff members, concerned about their safety and the future of the industry, leave to pursue other careers.
 "In a pandemic, people eat cake," quipped Olive Chase, owner of the Casual Gourmet in Centerville, noting one trend at her small restaurant -- another being that people have shunned indoor seats for the outdoor tables all summer.
 "(Fall business) is vital, especially when you lost the spring and summer," Chase said. Casual Gourmet operates an outdoor cafe at the Heritage Museums & Gardens in Sandwich, where the season can extend into the winter, and finds that people have become more tolerant of less-than-ideal dining conditions. She thinks diners will put on a jacket for fall dining, especially if portable heaters or a fireplace or firepit are present.
 But most of her business is catering, for weddings and other large functions. That side of the business pretty much dried up after Baker rolled back the maximum outdoor guest total from 100 to 50 people in response to an increased number of large private parties and an uptick in cases.
 "We had three or four weddings go to 2021 and had a bunch who had to uninvite guests," Chase said.
 Even more important entering the winter season is the maximum of 25 people now allowed at indoor venues regardless of the building size.
 On Aug. 28, the Cape Cod Chamber of Commerce spearheaded a delegation of Cape restaurant owners in appealing to state Housing and Economic Development Secretary Michael Kennealy for help in restoring the outdoor maximum to 100. The logic was that there was evidence the reduction actually caused larger gatherings to go underground, relocating to private homes where there was little of the oversight that a licensed restaurant or caterer would impose.
 Luz said the state and the Baker administration are very concerned about the restaurant industry and industry aid packages are under consideration from federal and state sources.
 "It doesn't get reported enough, but Governor Baker has gone out of his way to say that restaurants are not the problem," Luz said. "The clusters we see are private parties and unsanctioned events."
 Luz believes that as long as Massachusetts retains its low positive test rate of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, and other signals that the virus is under control, diners will return to indoor dining this winter.
 "I think guests will come back inside and they should be confident these restaurants have gone out of their way to be safe," he said.
 Luz even thinks bars could make a case for reopening by closing dance floors, putting in tables and serving food.
 "This industry can manage it all, from food trucks to food courts and full- service restaurants and catered events, even bars," Luz said.
 Alda Watanabe said Inaho may try reopening indoor dining again after summer crowds have died down. The stress has made them consider the inevitable.
 "We've been in the business for 35 years and we have to look at winding it down," she said. "We're not there yet, we're still hopeful."

Despite being unable to meet face to face and celebrate the new year as was done in the past, “Opening Day is coming anyway! It will be joyous even without all of the usual trimmings because our students will be with us.”
 Roxbury students will be taught through both remote and in-person learning. All students will receive remote instruction on Mondays. Those students who want to attend school will be able to with four hours of in-classroom instruction held two days each week.
 “After consultation with other school districts, our middle school athletics have been cancelled for the fall season,” the plan states.
 “Other after-school activities will be considered on a case-by-case basis with determinations made closer to the opening of school in September. Students will be responsible for arriving back to school for practices, or after-school activities, much like they do with a late practice, or a late activity. No determinations have been made for winter sports, however, we are monitoring the situation as it evolves.”
 The district was posed for the Tuesday opening after schools were sanitized and classrooms re-arranged to ensure social distancing. Classrooms can only hold no more than 50 percent of students, and everyone, students and staff alike, must wear masks when in facilities.
 Students throughout the county returned to school at a time when confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus are apparently receding.
 Last Friday, the Morris County Office of Health Management reported 7,555 confirmed cases, part of the 193,422 confirmed to date throughout the state.
 Roxbury’s number of confirmed cases had ticked up two, to 302.
 The new school year also begins as Gov. Phil Murphy further relaxed the social distancing orders implemented in March to slow the spread of the disease.
 As of 6 a.m. Friday, eateries were allowed to offer indoor dining providing no more than 25 percent of their capacity was filled.

Stefanski, 38, gained more significant roles through the years as assistant quarterbacks coach, tight ends coach, running backs coach and quarterbacks coach with the Vikings before being tagged interim offensive coordinator with three games left in 2018. He was a candidate for the Browns job that went to Kitchens, and when that didn’t materialize settled in as the Vikings offensive coordinator for 2019.
 All that grinding Stefanski mentioned was like 14 years of training to prepare him for one of the most unusual seasons in the 101 years of the NFL. Stefanski is trying to appease a fan base that hasn’t seen a winning season since 2007 and hasn’t seen a playoff game since 2002. He was 13 years old on New Year’s Day, 1995, when the Browns beat New England, 20-13, in their most recent playoff victory.
 “It has been unusual for us and certainly for all the 32 teams, but I think we have the right makeup in our locker room,” Stefanski said. “The leadership from a bunch of the guys on the field and in the building — I’ve seen it. I’m pleased with where we are right now.
 “This is a long season. Really to get this thing started, you have to set your sights on the first opponent, but there are games coming after that one and after that one and so on. We just have to make sure we play good football.”
 The novel coronavirus caused the league to close team training facilities in March, and that meant the Browns and the 31 other teams in the NFL had to coach virtually rather than go through the buildup of normal offseason programs.
 Next came the decision by the league and players’ union to cancel all preseason games. Preseason games would have benefited teams with first-year coaches more than the Steelers, Ravens and other teams with veteran coaches.
 Stefanski never even met the majority of his players until they arrived for training camp in late July.
 Next came national outrage over the death of George Floyd caused by a police officer in Minnesota and what followed, including Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield announcing he would kneel for the National Anthem.
 Stefanski supports his players in the fight for social justice, yet any time spent not involving making the Browns a better football team could be considered a distraction. Stefanski seems prepared to handle it well.
 “I’m in the moment, and what this moment calls for is dialogue and unity,” Stefanski said in late August after players decided to shorten practice to one hour from the normal two-hour session on the same day the NBA boycotted playoff games. “I think we’re getting that in a bunch of ways from this football team. That’s what I really appreciate about the guys we have.”
 It is anyone’s guess how Kitchens would have handled the challenges Stefanski has faced. While he seems to have the proper demeanor to go with his George Clooney looks, the bottom line is Stefanski won’t coach an NFL game until he stands on the sideline in Baltimore on Sept. 13. So nobody really knows what will happen.
 Stefanski seems to have weathered all the distractions so far without getting the lanyard holding his whistle twisted. Now he has to keep Odell Beckham Jr., Jarvis Landry, Austin Hooper, David Njoku, Nick Chubb, Kareem Hunt, Mayfield and everyone else happy while trying to stop the Ravens’ lethal run offense with a group of inexperienced linebackers.
 “I always was kind of wondering who was the one behind (the Vikings offense), and we end up getting the guy,” Beckham said on a recent Zoom conference. “There is definitely something to look forward to.”
 The way the Browns make coaching changes, there is always something to look forward to in the season opener.

Word of this setback for AMD comes at a time when its stock was trading close to all-time highs following the release of a new entry-level graphics card. What's more, it's about to face more heat from NVIDIA when the first of its new Ampere graphics cards hit the market later this month. None of this bodes well for AMD -- its share price had doubled year to date, but the stock is already down over 13% in September as investors digest signs of weakness in the company's business.

We are engaging with customers in ways that we actually weren't able to probably at the pace we would have liked in the past. So in general, I think it's a really a net positive for us in that regard. Having said that, there is some level of collegiality and physical presence that is lost, and we're doing all that we can to emulate that in this environment for now, looking forward to a time when we could all be together at physical locations and engaging in day-to-day collaboration and banter and everything that comes with work life.

"(I)t's one of those things where you get out there and hopefully it all comes back to me really quick," he said. "There's going to be rust, no doubt about it, but hopefully we can get it knocked off sooner than later. But I think that's what makes it fun. If I wasn't nervous and I didn't have that anxiousness, then I think you shouldn't be out there. There's not a love for the game if you don't have that. I think since I have those nerves already it shows that I still love this game, still passionate for it and I want to go out and win for my teammates, the fans and the city. So I'm not sure how bad it's going to be -- we can talk after the game -- but I'm sure it's going to be pretty different."

Looking at our financials for this quarter, we once again delivered record revenue of $126 million despite the global macroeconomic headwinds present today. It's important to note that while we are largely focused on growth, we're also focused on profitability and cash flows. To that end, Q2 was our ninth consecutive quarter of profitability on a non-GAAP basis. We also reached a new milestone this quarter having generated more than $100 million in adjusted free cash flow over the trailing 12 months. Our financial results clearly illustrate the leverage in our model, not to mention the strength in our balance sheet. We delivered solid results across the board, but make no mistake, we are playing to win the market over the long term.

Though the timing of opening the restaurant was not optimal due to the pandemic, the three partners couldn’t pass up the opportunity to open up their Galt location.
 “It was exactly what we were looking for,” Mehta said. “It was a little uneasy in the beginning, because of the timing, but we’ll get through this. We’re all going through this together and we’ll all get out of it together.”
 The restaurant offers ordering online through its website and traditional takeout. The restaurant is also looking into expanding their catering.
 “It will be easier once things open up, because of course right now, you can’t have big gatherings,” Mehta said. “So everything is pretty much up in the air.”
 Despite the difficult times, he is optimistic about the future. Mehta and his business partners are doing what they can to support their communities. They have donated more than 2,000 meals to hospitals in Auburn and Yuba City during the pandemic, he said.
 “We wanted to be there and appreciate all the doctors and nurses are doing for us. We just wanted to pass our appreciation on to them. (It is) much deserved,” he said.
