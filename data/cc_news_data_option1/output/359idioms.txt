"The two dogs were engaged in some sort of a fight in the bedroom where the infant was staying. The brother was actually able to separate the beagle away from the pitbull, take it out of the room and when he returned, he found that the pitbull had attacked the infant," Lafayette Police Lt. Matt Gard said. "The infant did suffer some catastrophic injuries."
 The first officer to arrive at the home found the pit-mix dog standing over the severely injured infant.
 "He could see that the baby had some pretty severe injuries and he believed the infant needed immediate lifesaving aid," Gard said. "Unfortunately, in order to render aid to the infant, the officer did fire his handgun one time, striking the dog, killing it."
 Julian was taken to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead. The Tippecanoe County coroner said a preliminary autopsy showed the baby died from multiple sharp force injuries from dog bites. The coroner is calling the attack accidental.
 It's not clear where exactly the baby was in the bedroom when the attack started. Police say the baby's mom was home at the time of the attack.
 Gard said the incident is affecting officers on the force in Lafayette.
 "A lot of our officers have young children of our own and seeing this is definitely tragic incident. It's one we hope we don't have to encounter again," Gard said. "Supervision of your children at all times is paramount. You never know, even the most friendly dog could turn. You never know."
 One neighbor told Eyewitness News he believed there should be a permit or license required to own a pit bull.
 "Because it is a dangerous dog, dangerous breed. And it's not really what you would consider a family dog," said the man, who only gave his first name, James. "Where I'm from, in New York, you have to get a permit for that type of breed. Same thing should be here. Same thing to avoid that happening again."

After all the planning and goal setting, you may be excited to hit the ground running this coming year, but it’s important to remember that change takes place slowly. Setting smaller, more attainable goals and spreading them out over a span of time will help to ensure you don’t do anything to put your business in jeopardy. Take these next few weeks, or even the entire month, to lay out some goals you’d like to reach and give yourself a reasonable amount of time to get there. You may have smaller goals in mind, in which you can accomplish in a month or two, but it’s also good to set some long term goals, giving you six months, or even a year, to work on them.     *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

Something is shaking on the cancer front that needs our full attention. The Trump administration, investigative journalist Sharon Lerner discovered, “is executing an old tobacco industry scheme to dismantle the federal government’s ability to protect the public from cancer.” The Trump White House has packed the federal Environmental Protection Agency’s top echelons with free-market fundamentalists who’ve set about “freeing” chemical companies from regulations designed to limit the presence of cancer-causing chemicals in our nation’s air, water, and soil. These political appointees are working hand in glove with America’s chemical manufacturers, outfits that have spent $1.4 billion on lobbying over the past dozen years. All those lobbying dollars have paid off. Chemical companies now have their pals running the regulatory show — and more Americans, as a result, figure to find themselves in families fighting cancer.

BEIJING — China today expanded sweeping efforts to contain a viral disease by extending the Lunar New Year holiday to keep the public at home and avoid spreading infection as the death toll rose to 80.
 Hong Kong announced it would bar entry to visitors from the mainland province at the center of the outbreak following a warning the virus’s ability to spread was increasing. Travel agencies were ordered to cancel group tours nationwide, adding to the rising economic cost.
 Increasingly drastic anti-disease efforts began with the Jan. 22 suspension of plane, train and bus links to Wuhan, a city of 11 million people in central China where the virus was first detected last month. That lockdown has expanded to a total of 17 cities with more than 50 million people in the most far-reaching disease-control measures ever imposed.
 The end of the Lunar New Year holiday, China’s busiest travel season, was pushed back to Sunday from Thursday to “reduce mass gatherings” and “block the spread of the epidemic,” a Cabinet statement said.
 Tens of millions of people were due to crowd into planes, trains and buses to return to work after visiting their hometowns or tourist sites for the holiday. Schools will postpone reopening until further notice, the Cabinet said.
 Also today, China’s No. 2 leader, Premier Li Keqiang, visited Wuhan to “guide epidemic prevention work,” the Cabinet website said. Photos on the site showed Li, in a blue smock and green face mask, meeting hospital employees.
 The U.S. Consulate in Wuhan, said it was arranging to evacuate its diplomats and some American citizens on Tuesday. The French government said it would fly its citizens in Wuhan to France and quarantine them there. Japan was preparing to fly its nationals out of Wuhan.
 French automaker PSA Peugeot Citroen, which has a factory in Wuhan, said it was moving foreign employees and their families by bus to be quarantined in another city.
 The disruption to business and consumer spending threaten to depress Chinese economic growth that Beijing is struggling to shore up after it sank to a multi-decade low of 6.1 percent last year. That could spread shockwaves to Asian economies that rely on China as a source of tourists and export markets.
 Chinese regulators called on banks and insurers in a statement today to support to people and companies affected by the outbreak.
 The biggest impact will be on travel, hotels and restaurants but Chinese retail spending, factory output and investment also might suffer if the outbreak and quarantines last, forecasters say.
 The outbreak is a “notable downside risk” to growth, though it “could potentially be a high impact but short-lived event,” said Tommy Wu and Priyanka Kishore of Oxford Economics in a report.
 They pointed to the example of the 2003 SARS outbreak, when economic activity plunged but recovered relatively quickly. The impact should be “less severe” than SARS because of faster official reaction and “increased transparency,” they said.
 Abroad, economies including Hong Kong, Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore and Philippines with big tourism industries that rely on Chinese travelers “seem most at risk,” said Wu and Kishore.
 The National Health Commission said 2,744 cases were confirmed by midnight Sunday. There were 24 new deaths on Sunday, all in Hubei province, where Wuhan is located.
 The youngest patient is a 9-month-old girl in Beijing. China also reported five cases in Hong Kong and two in Macao.
 South Korea confirmed its fourth case today. Scattered cases also have been confirmed in Thailand, Taiwan, Japan, the U.S., Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, Nepal, France, Canada and Australia.
 The U.S. has confirmed cases in Washington state, Chicago, southern California and Arizona.
 China’s health minister, Ma Xiaowei, said the country was entering a “crucial stage” as “it seems like the ability of the virus to spread is getting stronger.”
 President Xi Jinping has called the outbreak a grave situation and said the government was stepping restrictions on travel and public gatherings while rushing medical staff and supplies to Wuhan.
 The epidemic has revived memories of the 2002-03 SARS outbreak that originated in China and killed nearly 800 people.
 Then, Chinese authorities were criticized for reacting slowly and failing to disclose information. The government has responded more aggressively to the latest outbreak.
 The National Health Commission said anyone traveling from Wuhan is required to register with community health stations and quarantine themselves at home for 14 days — the virus’ maximum incubation period.
 Hong Kong announced it would bar entry to travelers from Hubei, starting today. Hong Kong residents returning from the area will be allowed to the territory but were told to quarantine themselves at home.
 Two of Hong Kong’s most popular tourist attractions, Hong Kong Disneyland and Ocean Park, closed.
 Also Sunday, Wuhan banned most vehicle use, including private cars, in downtown areas. The city will assign 6,000 taxis to neighborhoods to help people get around if they need to.
 Wuhan is building two hospitals, one with 1,500 beds and another with 1,000, for the growing number of patients. The first is scheduled to be finished next week.
 The National Health Commission said it is sending extra medical teams to Wuhan. The Chinese military dispatched 450 medical staff, some with experience in past outbreaks including SARS and Ebola.
 The virus is from the coronavirus family that includes the common cold but also more severe illnesses like SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. The new virus causes cold- and flu-like symptoms, including cough and fever, and in more severe cases, shortness of breath and pneumonia.
 The virus is thought to have spread to people from wild animals sold at a market in Wuhan. On Sunday, authorities banned trade in wild animals and called on the public to refrain from eating meat from them.

The measure still has a long way to go before it would become law, and Kemp promptly issued a veto threat.
 “You don’t change the rules at half-time to benefit one team over another,” spokeswoman Candice Broce said in a statement. “People are sick and tired of it. The Governor will veto any bill that attempts to undermine the rule of law for perceived political gain.”
 Kemp appointed Loeffler after Sen. Johnny Isakson retired because of health reasons. The governor is backing the wealthy businesswoman in her attempt to win the remaining two years on Isakson’s term.
 The measure that was considered Monday could set up a showdown between Kemp and powerful Republican state House Speaker David Ralston of Blue Ridge. Ralson issued a statement Monday supporting the proposal to add party primaries to the race for Loeffler’s seat, saying it “provides voters with order and certainty.”

In addition, one of the largest challenges for any mobile employee-and the business as well-is being responsive to customers, colleagues, and partners alike. In today’s fast-paced world, people who respond the quickest often win business. Thus, employees that are away from their desks much of the day miss important phone calls.

Basta con questi incarichi a tempo, nella speranza di essere poi stabilizzati». Va ricordato che l’allarme sui rapporti di lavoro a tempo determinato del personale infermieristico era già scattato a dicembre.

Infermieri e operatori che, pur avendo un contratto a tempo determinato in scadenza il 31 dicembre, stante l’endemica assenza di fondi nelle casse di via Anzio, aveva determinato la chiusura anticipata del rapporto di lavoro. Un problema che adesso si ripropone, sebbene in termini parzialmente diversi e che rischia di determinare, ancora una volta, una carenza di personale in un settore nevralgico come quello della sanità, con dirette conseguenze in capo al cittadino-paziente, da sempre l’anello debole del sistema, sul quale si ripercuotono gli effetti negativi.

Two men, including a Montreal resident, made a brief appearance before a Quebec Court judge in the Gaspe region Monday where they face charges in connection with the death of a man whose body has yet to be located.
 Steve Levesque, 46, of Montreal was charged with the second-degree murder of Maxime Dugas-Lepage, a man who is believed to have been killed on Jan. 21 in Ste-Anne-des-Monts, a town more than 700 kilometres northeast of Montreal and on the northern part of the Gaspe Peninsula. Levesque and an alleged accomplice, Maxime Labrie, 29, of Rimouski, were charged in the courthouse located in the same Gaspe town.
 Labrie is charged with being an accomplice after the fact to murder. The sole count indicates the Surete du Quebec believes Labrie travelled from the Gaspe to St-Lin-des-Laurentides and then to Rimouski over the course of five days last week before and after the day Dugas-Lepage, 27, is believed to have been killed.
 On Thursday, the SQ carried out a door-to-door campaign on 1st Ave. in Ste- Anne-des-Monts seeking information on Dugas-Lepage's whereabouts, but his body has yet to be located. According to court records, Dugas-Lepage resided on that street when he was arrested for cocaine possession during the summer of 2017. He pleaded guilty the following year and was sentenced to two years of probation.
 According to the electronic newspaper La Presse, Dugas-Lepage is the son of Martin Lepage, one of two men who were arrested by French authorities in July 2018 after the boat they were sailing on in the Caribbean caught fire as French customs officials and the French navy approached their craft, which had been registered in the Gaspe region. Lepage and the other Quebecer who was with him, Langis Belanger, escaped the burning boat in a lifeboat. But they were arrested after customs officials found more than 1,500 kilograms of cocaine on board.
 At the time it was seized, French authorities estimated the cocaine was worth more than $100 million and alleged the Quebecers set fire to the boat in an effort to destroy evidence of what they were bringing back to Canada. Lepage and Belanger were detained in Martinique in 2018, but the Montreal Gazette was unable to get an update on their case on Monday.
 Martin Lepage is also a resident of Ste-Anne-des-Monts and news of the drug bust in 2018 reportedly spread quickly through the town of only 6,700 residents.
 The case returns to court on Feb. 24.

"We've watched it his whole life, so we're just glad the world gets to see it now," Hawkins said recently in an interview.
 We talked for a brief time yesterday. He wouldn't go on the record about his godson. He said he had been asked by the Kansas City Chiefs to have all interview requests forwarded to them. Even though he technically has nothing to do with the Chiefs or football in any real way, he agreed to do it for his godson. "Whatever they think is best works for me," said Hawkins. "I don't want be a distraction of any kind."
 But there's a story to be told here about what baseball did for this football player, and just how much two end of the road big league pitchers factored in his life - and how this football magician, who everything came early to, has been MVP of the NFL at the age of 23 and could well be Super Bowl champion and possibly game MVP on Sunday one year later.
 This young, this soon, this great, Mahomes is inventing a new way to play quarterback. His way. The greatest in all sports have a way of doing that, they patent their own style, their signature and usually rather naturally. Mahomes tosses underhand to Tyreek Hill, the way a shortstop would throw the ball to a second baseman on an infield force out or a double play. He tosses sidearm, finding angles to get through the on-coming lineman, the way a shortstop deep in the hole and off-balance might try and find first base. He moves to his left and throws to his right, like a second baseman heading towards centre field. And none of that is lost on Hawkins, the baseball lifer.
 And when Mahomes runs, fewer than three times a game, it's more magic. His touchdown scamper against Tennessee in the AFC Final game was both breathtaking and historical. He wanted to throw and faked once and faked another time and bought himself more time, and suddenly the sidelines came open for him, and he bolted 28 yards for a touchdown.
 That's razzle dazzle quarterbacking from an artist who started amazing people in his first years holding a baseball and amazes them now with his vision, his running ability, his calm, his electricity, his sense of being on the field. Every great quarterback has his own way, most a little different from the other.
 Take the best of the best of all time and Mahomes has a little piece of almost every one of them - and just maybe something more.
 "We saw it in high school before he knew anything about being a quarterback," Hawkins said recently. "He was just out there on pure athletic ability and using his sixth sense and seventh sense to make plays. He went to college and got a little bit better at being a quarterback and now he's in the NFL. He's honed those quarterback skills and still has that same playmaking ability that he had as a sophomore in high school.
 Hawkins is convinced that both baseball and being ambidextrous has created a skill in Mahomes that is almost unmatched in the history of the sport. And he says that as a former ballplayer, and never much of a football fan. "I'm not a football fan," said Hawkins, "I'm a Patrick Mahomes fan.
 "(Baseball) has everything to do with it (what he's doing)," said Hawkins. "He played shortstop. He's also one of those guys that's very loose. He's like double-jointed. He can contort his body and do different things. It definitely plays a lot into what he's able to do when he's rolling out to the left or rolling to the right."
 Pat Mahomes never won a World Series. LaTroy Hawkins made the playoffs five different times, pitched in Colorado for a World Series team that didn't win it all and pitched for a Blue Jays team that could have won it all. This Sunday, with son and godson playing quarterback for Kansas City, is their championship game, too.
