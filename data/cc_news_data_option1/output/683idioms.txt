How can one help but fall under their spell when outside the scenery is brown and bleak? I long for the day my favorite perennials begin pushing their way up out of the bare ground or filling their branches with promising buds.
 I await the snowdrops and hellebores, the daffodils and crocuses, the redbuds and forsythias, the Jane magnolias, all early spring beauties that will soon appear upon the landscape. Other tried and true perennials, invisible all these winter weeks, will follow in vibrant succession.
 Ah, spring. The catalogs convince us it’s right around the corner, lifting our dreary mood and stoking our imagination.

Murrells Inlet, SC Henry D. Hall, age 88, passed away peacefully on February 14, 2020 at home in Murrells Inlet, SC. Henry was born in Holden, MA where he lived for 49 years before moving to Dillsburg, PA in 1979. He was one of the original founders of Holding Heating Co. Inc., where he worked for 30 years. He was an active member of several trade organizations: MA Service Managers, Better Home Heat Council, and National Oil Fuel Institute, from which he was awarded a silver certificate for outstanding service. During the Korean War, Henry served in the U.S. Navy on board the destroyer William M. Wood DD715 and was a proud veteran. In later years he drove school buses for special needs children and worked 22 years for Neil's Supermarket chain, where he was affectionately known as "the Sunday manager." One of the highlights of his life was being chosen during the 1970s oil shortage to serve on the MA Governor's Energy Council. All members of the council were invited to a dinner at Fenway Park with the Boston Red Sox. Some of the notable members of the team in attendance were Carlton Fisk, Yaz and Johnny Pesky. Henry is survived by his loving wife of 64 years, Lois A. Hall, a son, Stephen Hall Sr. and daughter, Kathleen Houck, all of Murrells Inlet; a sister, Bertha Stowell of Holden; 5 grandchildren, Stephen Hall Jr. of Culpepper, VA, Curtis Hall of Nashville, TN, Christina Hall of Panama City Beach, FL, Thomas Houck of Homosassa, FL and Rachel Digrugilliers of Mechanicburg, PA; and 3 great grandchildren. He was preceded in death by his sister, Mary Horstman of Holden. Services will be held at St. Michael's Catholic Church, 542 Cypress Avenue, Murrells Inlet, SC 29576 on Tuesday, February 25, 2020 at 10 am. In lieu of flowers, memorial donations can be made to

The greatest helpers set clear expectations from the outset. One of the first boundaries I set with clients is, “I will never care about your success more than you do.” A telling sign of over-helping is when you find yourself doing more to help others than they do for themselves. If a coach or leader routinely reminds clients or direct-reports of commitments they’ve made, accepts excuses when those commitments are missed, and even steps in to do some of the work for them, then the partnership is not equal. And if that coach or leader finds the superlative expressions of gratitude privately satiating (“I can’t thank you enough — you really saved me!”), their inner white knight has been activated. To be a great helper, you must be willing to let those you help suffer the consequences of their own choices when they fall short. Adhering to clear, mutual accountabilities makes success a shared outcome.

It's hardly surprising that a company as heavily reliant on producing and selling in China would feel the impact of the outbreak. But Apple's announcement was significant because the trillion dollar firm is the first major US business to specifically notifiy its investors that it will take a hit. The company said the outbreak is hurting both its production and sales in China more than previously expected.
 In response, US stocks kicked off their shortened Presidents' Day week Tuesday in the red, with the S&P 500 down 0.4%. Apple's announcement overshadowed news of a slowdown in the rate of new virus cases and more government stimulus measures to prop up China's markets and economy.
 The announcement was a timely reminder that the next earnings season could be painful, as investors brace for more companies to make similar projections. Consumer brands such as Under Armour and Canada Goose, have already issued warnings that the outbreak will hurt their bottom line.
 Food and beverage companies like McDonald's and Starbucks are also likely to feel some pain after closing stores in China to limit the spread of the virus.
 Both the supply chain and end markets for the semiconductor industry are likely affected by the outbreak, so investors are curious to see if companies like Intel or Nvidia may be the next to provide some guidance.

A new lawsuit filed by suspended Ashland Police Chief Lyn Woolford accuses the city's mayor of removing him from his job because he wouldn't do the mayor's bidding by removing a girlfriend from the mayor's home.
   
 Woolford's attorney, Matt Uhrig, on Monday filed the lawsuit seeking reinstatement and a declaration that he was suspended without cause.
   
 In a copy of the filing provided to the Tribune, Woolford accuses Mayor Gene Rhorer of firing Woolford as city administrator and suspending him as police chief for personal reasons.
   
 On at least two occasions, Uhrig wrote, Rhorer demanded Woolford send officers to his home to remove Rhorer's girlfriend.
   
 "Plaintiff recognized that it is not the function of police officers to intervene in defendant Rhorer's dispute with his girlfriend, as there was no apparent threat of violence," Uhrig wrote.
   
 Under Missouri law, a police chief who is unwilling to resign can only be removed from the job after a public hearing before the governing body of the city, with evidence of improper actions and a chance to offer a defense.
   
 The Ashland Board of Aldermen's first meeting since Woolford was suspended is Tuesday evening. That would be a chance for the board to reverse the decision to suspend Woolford.
   
 "Our hope is that the chief will be reinstated and we can move forward without having to prosecute the lawsuit," Uhrig said.
   
 Rhorer, who is not seeking re-election when his term expires in April, declined to comment on the lawsuit.
   
 "I am aware of all the state statutes and local law pertaining to dismissal and I am not going to comment on any of it," Rhorer said.
   
 Woolford has been chief since 2013 and prior to that was an officer for the Columbia Police Department. From 2015 until May, Woolford was also city administrator.
   
 Woolford has a high profile in the community and could often be seen wearing humorous hats as he directed traffic outside Southern Boone schools. In February 2019, he was honored as America's Favorite Crossing Guard in a contest sponsored by FedEx and Safe Kids Worldwide.
   
 Woolford was suspended last Tuesday. Deputy Chief Terry Toalson is serving as interim chief.
   
 The incidents where Rhorer tried to have his girlfriend removed from his home occurred while Woolford was city administrator as well as police chief, the lawsuit states. Rhorer called Woolford directly, instead of calling the police department or 911.
   
 "Plaintiff refused to order Ashland police officers to remove defendant Rhorer's girlfriend from the jointly shared residence and only dispatched officers to keep the peace," the lawsuit states.
   
 The lawsuit asks the court to order the city to preserve all its records and warns that Rhorer is personally conducting an investigation of Woolford.
   
 "This obviously poses grave concern to the plaintiff, in terms of the quality of the investigation, preservation of evidence and witness' fears of retaliation (as nearly all the relevant witnesses are City of Ashland employees who are subject to firing or disciplinary action by the defendants)," the lawsuit states.

But it’s not just for cattle producers.
 Glen Dolezal, assistant vice president of technology development for Cargill Protein, says the packing company puts the same pressure on themselves.
 “You can make progress if you measure it and discuss it and encourage it.”
 Cargill has cameras installed throughout their plants for 24/7 monitoring.
 “It’s for our animal handling and food safety interventions. We take a systematic approach to both,” he says. They do regular audits—both internal and external—on everything from stunning to electrical prod usage, and they’ve made measurable strides.
 “You watch it every day. You watch it every shift. You watch it in every plant,” Dolezal says. Then they benchmark plants to one another. “So it puts the pressure on employees to do the right thing and that’s how you make progress: both measure and manage it.”
 North American Meat Institute guidelines suggest packing plants not exceed 25% electrical prod use. Cargill’s goal was 15% or less.
 By last summer, they’d driven that usage down to zero in some plants. Air prods use pressurized air and vibrations to help move cattle, and they invest in handler training.
 Cargill is a strong supporter of the Beef Quality Assurance and Beef Quality Assurance Transportation programs.
 Their 2018 goal was to have 90% of the beef supply coming from BQA-certified suppliers.
 “We met that goal based on the volume we buy,” Dolezal says, noting producers in Texas lead the way. If it were based on number of suppliers, they’d be about half of that. “We have some room to improve…if you do business with Wendy’s, McDonald’s and others, they’re demanding this now. That’s why it’s become even more important to be able to tell the story that you’re following some sound guidelines and trying to do the right thing.”
 He asks cattlemen who have already gotten certified to encourage their neighbors.

NEW YORK -- The Dow and S&P 500 fell on Tuesday after a sales warning from Apple left investors assessing the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on U.S. companies.
 But indexes ended off the day's lows and the Nasdaq ended a touch higher as Apple Inc trimmed its losses in late-session trading.
 The world's most valuable technology firm said it would fall short of its recently announced quarterly sales target because of slower iPhone production and weaker demand in China due to the virus. Its shares ended down 1.8% at $319, while its low of the session was $314.61.
 "Certainly this was not welcome news, but I don't think it's a debacle either," said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.
 "In general, investors are not overly concerned by the news from Apple as a read through to technology or the market overall."
 While the exact hit to economic and earnings growth from the epidemic in China remains to be seen, hopes that the damage would only be temporary have helped boost confidence on Wall Street in recent sessions.
 Still, Apple suppliers, Qualcomm Inc, Broadcom Inc , Qorvo Inc and Skyworks Solutions Inc , all ended down between 1% and about 2% on the day.
 China-exposed chipmakers slipped, with the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index shedding 1.4%, while the broader S&P technology sector lost 0.4%.
 The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 165.89 points, or 0.56%, to 29,232.19, the S&P 500 lost 9.87 points, or 0.29%, to 3,370.29.
 The Nasdaq Composite added 1.57 points, or 0.02%, to 9,732.74, eking out a record closing high.
 Walmart Inc shares rose 1.5% even after the world's biggest retailer forecast slowing online growth for the year and reported weak results for the holiday quarter.
 Conagra Brands Inc shed 6.1% after the packaged food company lowered its full- year profit and sales outlook.
 Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.37-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.21-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
 The S&P 500 posted 71 new 52-week highs and 7 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 127 new highs and 66 new lows.
 Volume on U.S. exchanges was 7.23 billion shares, compared to the 7.61 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days. (Additional reporting by Medha Singh and Sruthi Shankar in Bengaluru; Editing by Subhranshu Sahu, Lisa Shumaker and Tom Brown)

 A few weeks later, Stichman said, the Pentagon had agreed to a timeline for releasing most of the records. But on Tuesday, the veterans group said access “continues to be severely limited.”

MONTGOMERY, Ala. (WSFA) - A federal grand jury has handed down a weighty superseding indictment in a pill mill investigation involving a Lee County psychiatrist.The indictment charges Dr. James Edwards with 87 counts of distribution of a controlled substance. Those charges represent 10 patients who received controlled substances outside the course of general medical care, according to the indictment.Court records indicate Edwards’s reportedly illegal prescribing practices date back to 2015, some of the patients listed in the indictment saw him for upwards of three years.This is the second indictment against Edwards, he was previously charged with five counts of drug distribution.Edwards was arrested in July 2019 as federal agents executed search warrants at his offices in Opelika and Gulf Shores. Aside from federal charges, prior court records indicate a physician and pharmacists lodged complaints against Edwards as early as 2016 concerning what they described as excessive prescribing habits.According to an affidavit, DEA agents spoke to pharmacists at eleven different pharmacies, seven in Opelika and four in Gulf Shores, who shared similar accounts of Edwards’s prescribing habits. Multiple pharmacists indicated they contacted Edwards directly to share their concerns. One pharmacist said she was told not to question him. Edwards reportedly told another pharmacist the patient needed the medications. Walmart has a corporate policy against filling Edwards’s prescriptions based on his “prescribing practices," according to records.Other court records indicate the DEA received another complaint against Edwards in the spring of 2019 from a mother whose son took his own life. The mother had written letters to Edwards because she suspected her son was abusing drugs. The affidavit says the week before her son passed away, she contacted Edwards’s office about his erratic behavior. He saw Edwards days before his death and received a prescription for Xanax. She felt Edwards’s prescribing habits contributed to her son’s death, according to those documents.In May of 2018, the Alabama Medical Licensure Board issued an Order to Show Cause that alleged Dr. Edwards had “excessively dispensed controlled substances,” and ordered him to prove why his Alabama Controlled Substances Certificate, or ACSC "should not be revoked.”State records show Edwards denied the allegation but reached a settlement with the Board. In light of the settlement, Edwards agreed that he was dispensing excessive amounts of stimulants and prescribed hazardous excessive doses of medications. The Board of Medical Examiners put Edwards on probation for at least 24 months. Dr. Edwards’s medical license became “active-conditional” following the settlement.The Board gave Dr. Edwards 120 days to rectify his prescribing habits and ordered him to follow strict guidelines. It’s unclear if this finding by the Board prompted the federal charge and subsequent search warrants.Copyright 2020 WSFA 12 News. All rights reserved.

“Gee, this is `small potatoes' compared to what Hillary Clinton did!” Trump tweeted on Aug. 24, 2018. “So unfair Jeff.”
 Trump didn't elaborate in his tweet on what he was alleging Clinton had done. Jeff Sessions was still serving as Trump's attorney general at the time of the tweet.
 Before her arrest and prison sentence, Winner had made it clear she was no fan of Trump's. On Facebook she once called him a “soulless ginger orangutan.”
 Winner struck a different tone after Trump's supportive tweet in 2018. In a jailhouse phone call, she told “CBS This Morning”: “I just can't thank him enough.”
 Trump has worked outside the traditional pardon process usually overseen by the Justice Department, appearing to favor cases that catch his attention. Some have been championed by friends, celebrities or conservative media.
 Trump's latest clemency spree Tuesday included commuting the 14-year prison sentence of former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, who was convicted of political corruption just months after he appeared on Trump’s “Celebrity Apprentice” reality TV show.
 Last week, the Justice Department at the direction of Attorney General William Barr recommended a lighter sentence than federal prosecutors had initially sought for Trump confidant Roger Stone, who was convicted of witness tampering and lying to Congress. Trump had tweeted that Stone's conviction “should be thrown out.”
 Grinter Allen said seeking clemency is Winner's only real chance for early release from prison. There is no parole in the federal prison system. And Winner gave up her right to appeal her sentence as part of her plea agreement.
 “Reality has taken full accountability for what she did,” Grinter Allen said. "...She's suffered enough and punishing her doesn’t serve any goals of a free people.”

_Cells at Work_ was one of the more surprising hits of the Summer 2018 anime season as it managed to blend a lot of great information about the processes behind the human body. Early last year, the series was confirmed to have a second season in the works but word has been quiet about how things have been shaping up ever since. But a new report from @Spytrue on Twitter notes that the second season of the series is heading our way later this year with a release window of Summer 2020.
 If this release window shapes up, the second season of the series will be released two years after the first season hit. Summer 2018 was the same window, so it would line up with a healthy production schedule for _Cells at Work_. Unfortunately, details about the new season have been kept under wraps so this release window is the least confirmed of all the new details.

Ubisoft wants to crack Rainbow Six Siege's attacking meta wide open. Currently, team composition feels hamstrung by the importance of hard breachers and electronic disabling operators like Thermite, Hibana, and Thatcher. On certain objective locations, attackers are at a huge disadvantage if they can't pop open a key reinforced wall. To add more variety to the meta, Ubisoft plans to distribute these roles to more operators via new secondary gadgets.
 The first one, announced by Ubisoft during the Six Invitational 2020, is a small hard breaching tool for attackers. Speaking to lead game designer Jean- Baptiste Halle, it's clear that this secondary gadget can partially fill the role of a hard breacher. Halle still wants dedicated hard breachers to be the best at their jobs, but the mini breach tool will be no slouch.
 He explained that for the mini breach to be worth using, it'll have to destroy hatches and make holes big enough to navigate through. Based on that, it sounds like the hole it creates might be vault-able, not not tall enough to run through while standing.
 Both game director Leroy Athanassoff and lead game designer Jean-Baptiste Halle also told me their plans for a secondary attacker gadget that rivals the roles of Thatcher and Twitch. Halle said this gadget is still in the early stages and the team isn't sure what form it'll take.
 Athanassoff believes that letting more operators participate in the core breaching meta opens up more "exotic picks" on a viable attack. He used the example of Nøkk, a fun operator to play that doesn't usually fit in with a rigid breach-heavy meta. If she had the option to bring an alternative hard breach or EMP tool, it'd give the meta more variety. Still, Halle recognizes that this can be a slippery slope to making certain attackers too useful. When it comes to both new secondary gadgets, he said the team will be carefully picking whose loadouts they belong in.
 Nobody at Ubisoft could tell me when we'll get our hands on these new secondary gadgets. I got the sense that the hard breaching tool is farther along in development than the Thatcher/Twitch equivalent, so we might see it sometime in 2020.

The announcement comes less than two months after Microchip Technology announced plans to lay off up to 275 employees from its Colorado Springs semiconductor manufacturing plant. Microchip planned to make the cuts in the first quarter as part of plan to shift production from older plants it acquired in its 2018 purchase of Microsemi and make the local plant a specialty facility focusing on automotive, military and aerospace products.
 Western Forge filed a layoff notice in 2015 with the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment indicating it would eliminate 150 jobs by early 2016 and never filed an update. At that time, the Colorado Springs plant employed more than 300 people. The company's 345,000-square-foot plant at 4607 Forge Road makes pliers, screwdrivers, adjustable wrenches, torque wrenches, punches, chisels and other tools sold by major retailers.
 Western Forge has a long history in the Springs. The company was started in 1965 in Defiance, Ohio, as a joint venture of Sears and founder William Schlosser to make torque wrenches. It moved to Colorado Springs a year later, where it expanded to all types of hand tools. In 1981, Emerson Electric Co. of St. Louis bought Western Forge, which employed more than 1,000 locally in 1990.
 By the late 1990s, the company moved its screwdriver manufacturing plant to North Carolina because the booming high-technology industry made finding Colorado Springs workers difficult. Western Forge closed the North Carolina plant in 2005 and accepted $200,000 in cash incentives from the city of Colorado Springs and the Colorado Springs Economic Development Corp. to consolidate operations in a vacant building on Garden of the Gods Road.

 At Shoes & Clothes for Kids, which helps improve school attendance through supplying clothes, shoes and school supplies to in-need populations, Uhl said another way to give back and support a cause without money is spreading the word.
 “If you have friends, family and business contacts that you think would be interested in the same philanthropic topics as you, host a meeting,” he said. “We love to sponsor things like that and come in to talk. If you’re willing to tell a philanthropic story of the cause you support, this can inspire others. The word of mouth component goes a long way.”
 Uhl added groups are also always welcome to help organize its warehouse.
 At the end of the day, the professionals said any size or type of gift is greatly appreciated by philanthropic organizations. Even if a donation isn’t five figures or someone wants to give back with their time, it still makes a difference in the long run.
 “It is still giving,” Rachek explained. “When you have a lot of small donors, this also spreads your word even further. One person giving a large gift means only one person knows about a cause. For a lot of these organizations, having the name recognition from many donors is so important to the life and health of the nonprofit. A lot of small donors means a lot of people are championing your cause.”
 Uhl noted, “(Smaller gifts) still help financially support an organization as the money goes into the program and demonstrates community support. We always look to see if we’re on the right track and when community members want to get involved, it shows your cause is important. That means you are on the right track.”

As low-density suburbs arose on the edge of every city, low-cost houses with abundant space and creature comforts became a singular symbol of progress and proof that the American way was winning. Compared to the rest of the world, American houses were large and full of modern furnishings, the latest appliances and a range of packaged foods and consumer products like Frosted Flakes, Oreo cookies, Hawaiian Punch, Tupperware, Minute Rice, TV dinners, Play-Doh, Frisbees and Barbie dolls. In 1959, during a walk through an American exhibition in Moscow, Richard Nixon, then the vice president, highlighted a six-room model ranch house to the Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev. "Soviet propaganda had been telling Russians in advance that the ranch house they would see at the U.S. exhibition was no more typical of workers' homes in the U.S. than the Taj Mahal was typical in India or Buckingham Palace in Britain," according to a TIME magazine story. "Nixon made a point of telling Khrushchev that the house was well within the means of U.S. working-class families."

Yep, it's time for yet another new film adaptation of Jack London's 1903 novel "The Call of the Wild." There was a silent version in 1923, which focused on the life of Buck, the pet dog-turned-sled puller. Then came a 1935 version, with Clark Gable and Loretta Young, that was more concerned with the star actors than the dog. And there followed two more films, both forgettable, but at least concentrating on the dog, in 1972 and, made for TV, in 1997.      But let's take a trivia break. The 1935 "Call of the Wild" was the last film to be released under the banner of Twentieth Century Pictures, before it became Twentieth Century Fox. The 2020 edition is the first film to be released under Twentieth Century Studios, after the word Fox was dropped from the name. Armed with that information, you will be a hit at your next cocktail party.      But unless you're planning to chaperone a young child to see the new film - which is a decent kid-centric adventure movie - there's no need to check it out on your own, especially if you're a discerning viewer who recalls the London book.      Yes, the film remains focused on the dog, even though no dog is actually seen in the film, as big Buck is a 100% digital creation with a very expressive face who might as well be wearing a big "F for Fake" sign on its forehead. In fact, all of the dogs, and all of the other animals in the film don't really exist. And, surprisingly, the folks at Disney, the parent company of Twentieth Century, have not used the same creative flourishes and believability that was on display in the all-digital "The Lion King."      But the visual glitches are small potatoes when considering the problems with this film. Screenwriter Michael Green ("Logan" and "Blade Runner 2049") comes up short here, and his use of the celebrated London novel as merely a jumping off point rather than a blueprint for the film is an egregious error.      Yes, it's still about Buck, enjoying a happy, relaxed life of comfort in a California household in the 1890s. And it's still about his travails after he's dognapped and sold off in the Yukon territory where, during the Gold Rush days, a dog of his size and strength is just what was needed to pull sleds across long, snow-covered distances. And it even has another main - but secondary to the dog - character named John Thornton (Harrison Ford) who helps turn things around for Buck.      But Green has taken absurd liberties with London's often rugged story. He's cleaned things up, taken the edge off. He's even - and this is the worst part - removed a large, important group of characters - there are no Canadian Indians to be seen - all in the name of what weak-minded people are passing off as political correctness. The mayhem that's now done in the story is committed by a fancy-dressing, money-hungry, hot-tempered white fellow named Hal (Dan Stevens, overacting). The character does appear in the book, and he's not a good man, but there he was Bruce Banner, and now he's a raging Hulk.      That Green has also imbued the film with some effective comedy is a good thing, even though most of it is of the cheap-laugh variety and is based on big Buck's ineptitude and clumsiness. Green also inserts a couple of scenes of great peril, though everything is settled before too much concern can be spent on them. One of the script's biggest annoyances is the overuse of narration, all of it by Ford, none of which makes any sense when you think about his character's circumstances at the end of the film. The most mystifying component here is that right after John Thornton tries to warn Hal of the dangers he's facing, the film jumps forward in time, with no explanation, as if a reel has been skipped.      At least there's still a romantic side story for Buck, but it's accompanied by a poorly written (cleaned up) ending that will leave young viewers asking their parents what happened.

SAVANNAH, Ga. (AP) — A former government contractor serving time in federal prison for leaking a classified document to a news organization is making an appeal for early release to President Donald Trump, who once tweeted that he considered her crime to be “small potatoes.”
 Reality Winner, 28, is serving a sentence of five years and three months at a federal prison in Fort Worth, Texas, after she pleaded guilty in 2018 to a single count of transmitting national security information when she worked at a National Security Agency office in Georgia. Prosecutors called it the longest sentence ever imposed for a federal crime involving leaks to the media.
 Winner's parents and sister appeared with her attorney at a news conference Monday in Dallas to announce the filing of an application with the Justice Department seeking clemency for Winner. Attorney Alison Grinter Allen said the application included about 4,500 letters of support.

Born 105 years ago this month, glamorous actress Ann Sheridan was destined to forever be known as the "Oomph Girl" following a mock contest organized by the Warner Brothers publicity department in 1939.      Stunning on-screen and becoming a favorite pin-up girl of World War II troops, Sheridan could play characters that were tough or tender, funny or flirty, and delighted audiences with her witty wisecracks and comebacks. While she certainly possessed an abundance of entertainment oomph, she hated the life- long label calling it "horrible" in a 1966 interview, a year before she died.      The Texas native starred in some memorable films of the 40s such as "The Man Who Came to Dinner," "Angels With Dirty Faces," "Kings Row," and "I Was a Male War Bride," but never landed a role in a true blockbuster film - there was no "Gone with the Wind" or "Casablanca" in her Hollywood resume of over 80 feature films.      In declining health at just 50, Sheridan ended her career in the little- remembered TV comedy western "Pistols 'n' Petticoats" which ran for one season in the 1960s. Carole Wells was one of the last actors to work with Sheridan.      "I'd never met her before that show," said Wells, who co-starred as Sheridan's daughter in the CBS series. "In fact, I didn't really know who she was - she had been a star before I was born."      The two first met the first day on set.      "We sat around a big table and read the script with the producers, writers, and director, and she was very charming but rather quiet," recalled Wells. "We would do this every week before filming and she was always just a down to earth sort of person."      Wells says the two chatted often but never became very close during the months they worked together.      "I'd see her in the mornings in the make-up department and give her a hug and say 'How ya doin' Annie?' And she'd say something like 'Wish I felt as good as you sweetie' \- she called everyone sweetheart or sweetie," said Wells. "She was never well from the beginning of the series."      In the mornings Sheridan was usually okay, according to Wells, but by noon couldn't work.      "It took a lot out of her and she would have to go back to her dressing room," she said. "So I would spend my lunch hour learning her lines which would be rewritten for me to say. But I didn't care because I knew she was ill."      Wells also remembers Sheridan as a chronic smoker.      "As sick as she was with cancer and emphysema, she was never without a cigarette in her mouth except while filming," said Wells. "She was very frail and thin and kept getting thinner as the series progressed. Basically, I watched her die in front of me. But with all she was going through, I never heard her complain and she was always very kind and respectful to me."      Sheridan struggled through much of the series but was too ill for the final half-dozen episodes.      "I knew she wasn't going to be around much longer," said Wells. "One day she was on the set, then the next day she wasn't and we never saw her again. When we heard she had passed away, the cast had a lunch to memorialize her."      Wells believes doing the show was good for Sheridan who still bravely displayed plenty of "oomph" despite her failing health.      "Before the series started, she had a facelift and got herself together," says Wells. "I think being part of the show might have helped her live a little longer."

NORWELL -- Students may be out of school this week, but some returned to the classroom Tuesday for their most delicious learning experience yet.
 Seven students from ages 8 to 14 are gathering in Norwell this week to learn cooking basics at Norwell's Good Life Kitchen. On Tuesday, the gang worked together to make homemade pasta, ravioli, garlic bread, pesto and red sauce.
 "I thought it'd be harder," said Mack Fernandez, 12, who enjoys baking cake and muffins but has never made pasta from scratch. "I'll probably try making this at home."
 Although the students are still in grade school, they are treated like adults and given real responsibilities in the kitchen of Chef Bernard Kinsella, who has been teaching classes for two decades. During class, they're in charge of chopping the red peppers and onions, grabbing the colanders, pinching the pasta dough and frequently wiping down their work stations.
 "Remember when you cook, you gotta clean," Kinsella told his students.
 Some of Tuesday's cooks were new to cooking, while others already enjoy working in the kitchen.
 Henry Walker, 14, received the class as a Christmas gift from his sister. Sometimes he'll make gingerbread cookies at home, he said, but he hopes this week-long class will expand his skill set.
 "My mom wants me to make dinner tonight," Walker said, laughing.
 Kinsella said kids are never too young to start testing their chops in the kitchen, and that he had his own first experience in the sixth grade.
 "My brother used to [make doughnuts] on Sunday mornings. One day I woke up and asked 'Where are the doughnuts?' and he said 'You've watched me enough, you can make them,'" Kinsella recalled.
 By seventh or eighth grade, Kinsella said he knew he wanted to be a chef, and credits his home economics teacher with helping to cultivate his passions and talent.
 "It reminds me of where I was when I started, so I hope maybe I inspire someone," he said. "There's so much to do with food. People just gotta learn to be more knowledgeable about what they eat and where it comes from."
 Kinsella is assisted in the kitchen by Susan Palombi, who ensures students use knives safely and, more importantly, have fun and learn.
 "I just like to see the kids learn and their reactions when they first come in. Some are like deer in headlights, but it's a 180 once they start getting involved," she said. "I like to see the transformation in them."

General Mills has partnered with consultants from Understanding Ag who will work with producers to identify and implement changes to their farming. Understanding Ag’s farm advisers will collect the information needed to verify changes.
 Jason Hildebrand, a farmer from Stafford who will be part of the study, has seen his cattle herd increase because of some of the regenerative practices he implemented during the past three years.
 Hildebrand has used some no-tillage and cover crops on his farm, and he said this project will help him understand the benefits.
 “I think the soil is getting better, but I have not done a good job of soil testing,” Hildebrand said. “They’re going to do that. That will leave me time to do what I do best—farm.”
 ESMC will generate certified credits based on actual impacts upon the environment. This consortium is launching more pilots this winter and spring in the Midwestern corn and soy region. By 2030, the ESMC seeks to enroll 30% of available working lands in the top four crop regions and top four pasture regions of the United States, impacting more than 250 million acres of land.
 “This project will result in real, quantified reductions of GHG emissions and nutrient loading to surface water, while also providing key insights to attain efficiency and scale,” said Debbie Reed, ESMC executive director.
 Jamie Funke, a farmer in Partridge, is happy to be on board. Having practiced regenerative practices for more than five years, he said, his fields “look like trash.” With sunflowers, xenias, cowpeas, buckwheat and radishes growing on his fields, it’s hard to see the soybeans.
 “Two years ago, some of those plants got over eight feet tall. You could get lost in there,” Funke said. “It made wonderful cover.”
 Funke hopes this project will help convince consumers to research where their food is coming from.
 “This regenerative agriculture movement is moving toward more of a biological approach in where you’re trying to coax nature to work with you,” Funke said. “Before, you were trying to force nature to do what you want done with chemicals.”
 By having their land become resilient to extreme weather conditions, farmers are able to weather the storms and droughts.
 “We’ve changed the way people think, the way they manage their land,” said Howard Miller, outreach coordinator for the Cheney Lake Watershed. “Soil that is anchored in a living root does not enter the stream. It stays in the landscape.”
 General Mills will utilize GHG improvements in their sustainability reporting, and KDHE will identify buyers who seek certified water quality benefits that participating farmers achieve.
 Along with improving soil health and grain nutrition, the cereal manufacturer hopes to reduce its GHG emissions by 28% by 2025. Last March, the company launched an oat initiative in Canada and northern North Dakota.
 “The goal of the pilot program is to encourage farming practices that improve both soil health and water quality in the Cheney Reservoir region such that agriculture is the solution to a more resilient and clean water supply for Wichita residents,” said Leo Henning, deputy secretary of the Division of Environment at KDHE. “We believe regenerative agriculture can improve the quality of this vital water source and if we are successful, it’s win-win-win, for farmers, communities and the environment.”
 By demonstrating a profitable model, General Mills and Understanding Ag hope to lead the way into more environmentally friendly farmland. By using these techniques, farmers will increase biodiversity and lesson floods and runoff on their land.
 “If we can prove we can grow better crops cheaper, that’s what’s going to change things,” Funke said. “I think General Mills is trying to do the right thing. They need more high-quality grain.”

“That’s going to help a lot. Having that year under my belt, it’s another year facing those big league pitchers and being on the big league field out there, and being around these guys,” the 26-year-old Stewart said Tuesday. “That’s going to pay huge dividends in the long run.”
 Stewart said he’s worked hard this offseason on his mobility and flexibility. Manager Ron Gardenhire says this is a big season for the outfielder.
 “Planning on him being our left fielder, but he needs to go play. He needs to get it done,” Gardenhire said. “We talked about that — hold yourself accountable, we’re going to hold you accountable to get it done. Start showing us that you’re moving forward.”
 Stewart was a first-round draft pick in 2015. Turnbull was taken in the second round a year earlier. After making four appearances in the majors in 2018, the right-hander became a rotation mainstay last year.

The first two innings of Monday's softball season opener proved a little shaky, but by the end of the night the Brownwood Lady Lions had earned a dominant 10-4 home victory over the Class 3A Jim Ned Lady Indians.
 Down 2-0 through 2 ½ innings, the Lady Lions scored four runs each in the third and fourth frames, then tacked on solo runs in the fifth and sixth to reach double figures in the initial outing of the season.
 "We came out a little tentative at the plate for a couple of innings and then we started getting aggressive with our swings on good pitches," said Lady Lions head coach Jessica Lynn. "That's what we've been trying to get them to do and they finally came alive. We got some extra-base hits and those are contagious, and we showed a good example of that thorough the middle of the game tonight."
 The Lady Lions finished with 13 hits -- including five doubles -- and drew four walks off Jim Ned pitchers Chassity Beasley and Kylie Gwinn. Cecilia Rodriguez led the way with three singles and an RBI, Annie-Klein Allgood doubled twice and drove in three, Auzzlyn Benedict added two doubles and an RBI, Ashlynn Patteson finished with a pair of hits -- including a double -- with two RBI, Mackenzie Welch singled twice and plated a run, Chesney Covey singled once, Aubrie Harris contributed a single and two walks, and Caitlyn Moody drew a pair of walks.
 In the circle, Allgood went the distance and yielded two earned runs on four hits with three strikeouts and a walk.
 "She did a good job of keeping them off balance and she did a good job keeping her composure and trusting her defense because they hit her hard a couple of times," Lynn said of Allgood.
 Defensively, the Lady Lions committed five errors, with four coming in the first two innings that led to Jim Ned's early advantage.
 "We had some early mistakes but it's nothing we can't work on," Lynn said. "We had a couple of mistakes in the outfield but we're a little inexperienced out there and it will get better as the season goes on. It's all about finding the right mixture of players, the right chemistry and I like the group we had out here tonight. We have a few more players we're going to try and work in to see what lineup we want to stick with through district."
 Knotted at 4 in the bottom of the fourth inning, the Lady Lions tallied four runs to seize complete control of the contest. Covey reached on a bunt single to start the frame and moved to second on a sacrifice bunt by Harris. Benedict then doubled off the left field wall to plate Covey with Brownwood's fifth run. Allgood was then plunked by a pitch ahead of Patteson's RBI single that brought home Benedict. Lexi Castillo then reached on an error that allowed Heaven Badillo -- running for Allgood -- to score. Rodriguez followed and reached on another Jim Ned miscue, then scored on a wild pitch.
 Brownwood's fifth inning featured a two-out RBI bloop double by Allgood that plated Harris, who singled to right field with one out.
 Then, in the sixth inning, Welch's two-out RBI single drove in Rodriguez, who singled to right field with one out.
 Jim Ned took a 2-0 lead in the top of the second as Kambri Smoot led off with a walk, moved to second on a sacrifice and scored after stealing third base with no one there to cover. Gwinn then reached on a one-out, four-base error as a fly ball to right field was dropped and rolled to the wall.
 Brownwood bounced back in the bottom of the third inning with its first four- spot. With one out, Harris walked and Benedict doubled to left field ahead of a two-RBI double to left field by Allgood, which evened the score at 2. Patteson then singled to right field to plate Badillo, running for Allgood, to stake the Lady Lions to a 3-2 lead. With two down, Welch singled home Castillo, who earlier reached on a fielder's choice.
 Jim Ned answered with two runs in the top of the fourth to knot the score at 4. Gwinn led off with a single and Smoot followed with a one-out RBI double. Then, with two outs, Koti Goolsby's RBI single to right field plated Smoot.
 The Lady Lions (1-0) are back in action at 6:30 p.m. Tuesday at Stamford.
