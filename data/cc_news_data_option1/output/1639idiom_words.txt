Fear of punishment may be the single most significant factor behind the argument of implementing a law to enforce a behavioural change. It may be defined as when one has to face the repercussions in the guise of penalty or imprisonment, people avoid breaking the laws.

Several measures, including health warnings, were used to curtail smoking. But one factor that has demonstrably contributed to a sustained decline in smoking was a ban on it in public places. One of the first pieces of legislation to curb smoking in public places followed an order of the Kerala High Court, way back in 1999.

A research paper published last year by Digant Shastri, National President of Indian Academy of Pediatrics, notes "sensationalisation by media" as of the key reasons behind attack on doctors.

Several patients complained of cockroaches, dirty toilets and lack of proper food in Covid-19 hospitals. This leads to fear among those approached by doctors for testing, resulting in the behaviour that still cannot be justified.

The mental and physical harassment hit its peak last week when a doctor in Chennai, who died after being infected with the coronavirus, was refused a proper burial by locals who protested at the cemetery. As the mob pelted stones and attacked the ambulance, his colleagues had to dig a grave with bare hands to bury him.

According to a joint survey by EY and The Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, ‘Re-engineering Indian Healthcare 2.0', at least 60 per cent patients surveyed in 2019 believe that hospitals did not act in their best interests, as against 37 per cent patients in 2016.

Among other causes of violence against doctors in India are the deplorable conditions in which patients are treated at government hospitals.

The behaviour is similarly portrayed in interactions with people. Any suspicious or potential carrier is automatically avoided to minimise the spread of disease, leading to a kind of instinctive social distancing. However, this can at times be quite crude. This means the responses are often misplaced, and may be triggered by irrelevant information.

Given that India places doctors highly in society, violence against may seem unlikely. But, according to a study by the Indian Medical Association, over 75 per cent of doctors have faced violence at work. Citizens across the country have also expressed their trust deficit in India's healthcare system time and again.

Having listed the psychological reasons, it is important to remember that people always had these deep-rooted biases. An increased threat of disease simply hardens their positions.

Pandemics are generally unprecedented for a generation. They take a serious toll, for the masses, mostly on the mind. Also, human minds are evolved for socialisation. Any attempt at quarantine for an extended period of time can put individuals off the grid. Therefore, it is important to understand how events such as a sudden, prolonged lockdown, with no clarity of its end, affect humans mentally.

Ever since India imposed a nation-wide lockdown to curb the spread of coronavirus, doctors have endured ostracisation from their neighbours and landlords, been subjected to stone pelting when tracing contacts of a Covid-19 case and beaten by cops on their way back from inhumane shifts.

This explains the incident that took place in Gujarat's Surat on April 6. Dr. Sanjibani Panigrahi was inordinately harassed merely for being a doctor and treating Covid-19 patients. Working at the government-run civil hospital in the city, she was ridiculed as a carrier of coronavirus by her neighbours. When she did not pay any heed, her neighbour obstructed her from entering her own house while mouthing obscenities. The 34-year-old put out two videos that clearly portrayed the harassment.

"As a hypothetical example, a television reporter shouting at the medical superintendent of a Delhi hospital reeling under a load of dengue patients as to why antimalarials were not given to a patient who died of dengue. This is done with an air of ‘knowledge’ that viewers would be convinced that not giving antimalarials to a patient of dengue in shock was medical negligence of the highest order," wrote Neeraj Nagpal, convener, Medicos Legal Action Group, a registered Trust of qualified doctors in a research paper published by The National Medical Journal of India.

There needs to be a complete overhaul of the existing economic system and healthcare system. "Our country’s health budget spending is meagre (approximately 2 per cent) as compared to that of western countries.

Social and job-induced responsibility was at crossroads when on April 9, two doctors came under attack in Madhya Pradesh's Bhopal by a man in khakhi. Two resident doctors — Dr Yuvraj Singh and Dr Rituparna Jana – from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS, Bhopal) were returning home after emergency duty at the hospital when a police patrol party not only assaulted them, but even abused and blamed them for spreading coronavirus. While Dr Singh's hand was fractured, Dr Rituparna sustained injuries on her leg.

Most laws wanting to change social behaviours resulting from deep-rooted underlying causes have not been able to. For example, several laws have been passed in the US to end racial discrimination. Despite these, in a study among Airbnb customers, researchers at Harvard Business School found that African Americans were 16 per cent less likely to be accepted as guests than Caucasians. The study could not find any variable beyond race to explain this attitude.

"People there told me that they were scared. They thought doctors will conduct tests and quarantine all of them.

El artículo después enumera y agradece su labor a una serie de personas encargadas de supervisar la construcción, la logística o los cuidados médicos de los trabajadores, pero no menciona más detalles sobre el líder de Corea del Norte.
 Los medios norcoreanos han informado en los últimos días de que Kim ha enviado cartas diplomáticas o regalos.
 Sin embargo, llevan sin reportar actividad alguna de Kim Jong-un sobre el terreno ni publicar una imagen actual suya desde el 12 de abril, cuando informaron de una reunión del buró político del partido único celebrada en la víspera y presidida por el dictador.
 En ese encuentro, el líder nombró a su hermana, Kim Yo-jong, miembro suplente de ese importantísimo órgano ejecutivo.
 A esto se ha sumado después la inusual ausencia de Kim Jong-un de varios eventos de importancia, incluidos los fastos del 15 de abril, principal festividad nacional.
 En ese contexto, marcado a su vez por la pandemia de coronavirus, y ante la tradicional opacidad del régimen norcoreano, diferentes medios han publicado informaciones, citando siempre fuentes anónimas, en las que se dice que el estado de salud del mariscal es delicado, en muchos casos por una supuesta operación de corazón.
 Sin embargo, el Gobierno surcoreano ha descartado la validez de estas informaciones e insistido en que no ha detectado ninguna actividad inusual en Corea del Norte, al tiempo que imágenes satelitales analizadas por la web especializada 38 North situaron el tren especial del líder en Wonsan.
 A su vez, Moon Chung-in, asesor especial de seguridad del presidente surcoreano Moon Jae-in, aseguró el domingo en Fox News que Kim 'está vivo y está bien', mientras que la revista Newsweek afirmó que Washington tampoco ha detectado actividad militar norcoreana fuera de lo común. EFE
