Chester City, as well as Clifton Heights and Morton boroughs, were among the county municipalities to issue emergency declarations and operations plans Monday evening and Tuesday afternoon in response to the COVID-19 virus.
 Chester city government will be operating to ensure only essential functions; government buildings are closed to the public. The declaration will not interrupt regular trash and bulk trash services. “Department heads have identified essential personnel. We’re up and running, just with a skeleton crew,” Fire Commissioner and Emergency Management Coordinator William C. Rigby said Tuesday. "Public safety concerns are the biggest issues we’re staying on top of.”
 The Monday announcement states “please do not be alarmed if police, fire or EMS personnel interact with you differently. Our first responders are taking extra precautions for your safety due to the number of people they interact with daily.”
