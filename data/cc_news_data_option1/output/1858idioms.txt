TORONTO - Ivan Ostos biked through rainstorms, braved the coldest days of the year and pedalled up plenty of hills to drop off hot meals for three popular food delivery apps — until a significant portion of his work vanished May 11.
 That's when Foodora, the company that provided about 85 per cent of his business, closed its Canadian operations after concluding it couldn't be profitable in the market.
 For Ostos, who spent years in a battle seeking the right to unionize after breaking his arm and being unable to work for almost five months, the realitiesof the gig economy are once more making it harder for him to pay the bills. To make ends meet, Ostos will now have to turn to Uber Eats and Door Dash. He fears they too could exit the country on a whim, leaving him jobless again.

Victorian gardens reached their glory when a worldwide gardening frenzy erupted with the introduction of new and exotic plant varieties being discovered around the globe. It was a time when those fabled plant explorers were in their heyday. Some folks confuse Victorian gardens with cottage gardens, when in fact the two garden approaches were quite different.
   
 Victorian gardens were famous for their gaudy enormous foliage plants, huge colorful blossoms and unique bed designs. It wasn't unusual to see a Victorian flower bed in a paisley shape or a circular or oval mound topped with dramatic exotic plants. And many of those dramatic Victorian plants were crinums, flowering bulb plants with handsome trumpet-like blooms. Crinums were all the rage in Victorian times. And gardeners today are discovering these amazing plants.
   
 "Crinums were an aristocratic plant for may years. It was only the very rich who had them," explained Tony Avent, noted horticulturalist, garden writer at Plant Delights Nursery.
   
 Here in Florida, plantsman Henry Nehrling and others were working on hybridizing them in the early 1900s. And for a time, only the best Southern gardens sported the newest and showiest crimuns. Then things changed.
   
 Avent explained that as neighborhoods evolved and their residents moved to newer homes, the hardy crinum lilies proved to be almost impossible to transplant.
   
 "It was just too much trouble to dig them up and move them," he said. "Crinums, like amaryllis, have contractile roots -- roots that actually pull them (deeper) into the ground."
   
 The bulbs also can achieve enormous sizes, weighing up to 40 pounds. Plants themselves can grow to 6 feet tall and cover substantial areas of ground.
   
 It might even have been their hardiness that led to their diminished popularity. Gardeners do tend to obsess over rare and finicky plants, while dismissing those that seem common and easy to grow. It wasn't long before crinums became "the plant of the lowers class -- a pass-a-long plant found mostly in poor neighborhoods," Avent added.
   
 But those very qualities that attracted Victorian gardeners to crinums have attracted gardeners today. Crinums are bursting into bloom now in gardens all around. This varied family has some 130 species, a few of which are hardy down to 26 degrees. The most common crinum found in the state is the spider lily (Crinum americanum), with tattered-looking pure white blooms atop strap-like foliage. Although many crinums are from Asia and Africa, the fragrant spider lily is a Florida native. It can often be found growing wild in wetlands and alongside streams.
   
 Crinum culture is fairly easy, as might be expected. Plant the bulbs (or plants) in a location with good drainage, rich soil amended with compost in full sun or very light shade. Allow enough space -- several feet on all sides -- for the plant to grow and expand. Plant bulbs with the tips of the bulbs just below the soil surface, watering in well. Avent recommends purchasing crinum plants rather than bulbs, because the bulbs do not fare well in dry storage and may not produce healthy plants.
   
 Plants will take off once the weather gets hot, though they may not flower their first season, especially when starting with bulbs. Here in this part of the state, many may experience die-back in the winter due to cold temperatures. But most are hardy to this zone and will grow back if nipped by the cold.
   
 Insect pests are few, but can be substantial if not controlled. In particular the lubber grasshopper.
   
 "They are a great food for our lubber grasshoppers," quipped Mary Collins, senior horticulturalist at Fairchild Tropical Garden in Coral Gables.
   
 This has limited the use of crinums in the gardens there because the garden staff and volunteers had trouble keeping up with the voracious insects and the crinum collection there is contained in the garden arboretum. Removing or squashing the clusters of baby lubbers which hatch out in the spring it a good defense against the damage the grasshoppers can cause. Crinums can be affected by a red blotch fungus or criumn mosaic potyvirus which causes yellow streaks on the foliage. Spider mites can also be a problem.
   
 But for the most part, these hardy perennials live up to their reputation for a lot of show for a little effort. Flowers can range from pure white to variegated red and white to pink and on to deeper shades of red. Foliage of the spectacular C. procerum Splendens is reddish-purple. This handsome crinum can grow to 6 feet tall or taller. Many provide dramatic focal points in the landscape due in part to their large size and foliage.
   
 If you are moving or dividing a crinum, it is best to do so in the winter when plants are dormant. Dig around the clump, lift and then remove offshoot bulbs to plant elsewhere. Crinums can be planted in large containers with success. Plant propagation can also be by seed in non-hybrid species (seedlings are often not true to type) or by use of side shoots for most varieties.
   
 Select one for a specimen planting or several for a grand statement. Whatever your choice, crinum lilies represent a noble legacy of Southern garden heritage.

Nobody's perfect. But, to count the noses of those who respond to the annual Gallup Poll on ethics in the professions, nurses are pretty close to perfection. They're far closer than most of us.
   
 Smack in the middle of National Nurses Week - May 6-12 - this seems like a good time to point out that 85% of Americans say nurses' ethical standards and honesty are "high" or "very high." This figure comes from a list of major professions that Gallup researchers ask adults in the United States to assess every year.
   
 For the 18th year in a row, nurses lead the pack by a wide margin.
   
 The medical professions in general rate at the high end when Americans calculate our assessments of honesty and ethical behavior. Medical doctors, pharmacists, and dentists all get ratings in the 60s.
   
 But while we give high marks to medical professionals generally, nurses outpace the people whose orders they execute and who rate higher in the medical pecking order and pay scale than they do. The difference isn't a marginal few points. They are fully 20 points higher than the next category of workers in their field. That is impressive.
   
 The survey from which I am quoting was published in January of this year. If the polling were to be repeated right now, I suspect the gauge would move even higher.
   
 During the COVID-19 crisis, there has been consistent and deserved praise for the way all healthcare professionals have handled themselves. Working in home health, nursing homes, and hospitals, the more than 2.5 million registered nurses currently employed have distinguished themselves yet again for their dedicated patient care.
   
 A previous director of the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, Dr. Linda Rosenstock, has testified before Congress that the injury rate for healthcare workers is greater than for such historically high-risk occupations as agriculture and construction work. And nursing is the largest of the healthcare professions.
   
 Not only are nurses subject to injury from patient handling, bloodborne infections (Hepatitis B, Hepatitis, C, HIV), and chemical risks (disinfectants and cold sterilants can cause skin and respiratory problems), they are particularly vulnerable to respiratory diseases such as tuberculosis, influenza, and - what is on everyone's mind now - COVID-19.
   
 Everyone has learned the acronym PPE (personal protective equipment) during this pandemic because of its shortage. From gowns and gloves to masks and face shields, the acute shortage of these items put all healthcare workers at greater-than-usual risk.
   
 Nurses continued to work, felt the increased stress of being without a clear standard of care for patients, and wound up treating some of their own medical colleagues and friends as coronavirus patients. They wrestled with their personal fears as some of those colleagues and friends succumbed to the disease. Circumstances did not even allow them the grace of a memorial service to grieve their deaths.
   
 Hospitals function around the clock. That means shift work 365 days of the year to provide the personnel their chosen profession demands. I declare once again my considerable admiration for the teamwork of administrators, physicians, nurses, technicians, support staff, and non-medical team members who keep our hospitals online for all of us.
   
 We civilians who depend on you salute all our devoted healthcare workers - but nurses especially during this National Nurses Week. It obviously isn't appropriate right now to give you the hugs you deserve. But we honor you for choosing to dedicate your lives to the care of others.
   
 For now, we do the best we can from a safe social distance to say thank you for who you are and for the magnificent work you do. And we pray for God to bless and protect you.

Ramsay couldn't say exactly how many players have been affected, but added the union membership is facing many of the same realities Canadians are these days.
 "This is a scenario many Canadians are going through," Ramsay said, adding the players who've had their off-season work impacted are Canadians and Americans (who are permanent residents in Canada) employed in Canada.
 Just over half of CFL players are American.
 Players losing their off-season jobs in Canada due to the pandemic can apply for either unemployment insurance or the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB). However, both provide only temporary relief and usually the funds they provide are less than what was being earned beforehand.
 CFL players working during their off-seasons is nothing new. Ramsay, 40, worked for KPMG — a Canadian tax, audit and advisory service — for nine years during his football career as an offensive lineman with Toronto, Hamilton and Edmonton (2006-2015).
 Ramsay would train for football in the morning and evening, but spend the days of his off-season working as an accountant. When the CFL campaign began, he'd take a six-month leave of absence before returning at season's end.
 Towards the end of his career, Ramsay said he even worked with KPMG during the CFL season.
 "My pay scale never climbed but my seniority did," Ramsay said. "The money wasn't important to me because I knew I was making income playing.
 "What was important was gaining the nine years of experience and climbing up in seniority in the firm so my responsibility when I came back for those six months was reflective as if I'd been there for nine years up to the end."
 Given the average pro football career is roughly three seasons, Ramsay said the CFLPA wants its players to gain off-field work experience.
 "More and more of our guys are working or gaining experience to be able to prepare for life after football," Ramsay said. "We're encouraging that."

As one of three speech-language pathologists hired by the Boonville R-1 School District, Risa Venable has been able to use her time wisely during COVID-19.
   
 She serves approximately 70 students each week from three different schools -- Laura Speed Elliott Middle School, Boonville High School and Saints Peter and Paul Catholic School. Her therapy supports students who struggle with articulation, speech fluency, have receptive and expressive language deficits, and difficulties with social language skills.
   
 "I knew I wanted to be in a helping profession," Venable said. "[I[ have strong communication skills and love to teach, but knew I did not want to manage a full class of students."
   
 When she stumbled upon the major in college she knew it was the right fit for her.
   
 "My favorite part of being a school-based [pathologist] is making lasting connections with my students and families," Venable said.
   
 She has served as a school-based speech-language pathologist for 15 years, with eight in the Boonville district. She has used the school closure to amend each student's Individual Education Plan, along with the other members of the special education team, to include distance learning as a service delivery model.
   
 "I now teach my students from home through video conferencing or instructional phone calls,"Venable said. "Some parents have declined my services for their kids at this time, some have not responded to the offer, but a vast majority I am still serving weekly."
   
 Boonville Superintendent Sarah Marriott said the school closure presented unique circumstances for education service delivery, specifically in the area of special education and related services. "Often, special education and related services necessitate face-to-face interactions," Marriott said. "Our therapists and special education providers have found creative ways to provide services in light of the challenges related to school closure. Zoom meetings, Google Hangouts, and other virtual sessions have allowed our therapists and educators the ability to maintain individualized contact and instruction which is vital to our students. We commend our therapists and teachers for their exceptional efforts to deliver services to students in an effective manner which provided students opportunities for continued progress and learning."
   
 Students continue to engage in their learning.
   
 "We have both, reviewed previously learned material and presented new,"Venable said. "I want to stay connected with my students and keep them moving forward towards their goals, even though we cannot be in physical contact."
   
 She continues to hold IEP and evaluation meetings with parents and teachers through video conferencing as well.
   
 The closure has pushed her to learn new technology and therapy tools she never used before.
   
 "Parents, students, and staff alike have been presented with new technologies, and while for some, it is exciting and new, for others it is very overwhelming,"Venable said. "It's just a lot, and I totally get it."
   
 Venable has two elementary-school aged children who she and her husband are teaching while continuing with their full-time jobs.
   
 "There were a few days each one of us was on our own Zoom call in different areas of the house," she said. "I encourage all teachers, students, and parents alike to give each other grace in this unprecedented time. We are all in this strong pirate ship together and I see blue skies ahead."

The hyperplasia that occurs prior to the hepatocellular carcinoma.

We've done a number of other fatty liver models here and there, and we've shown improved glucose tolerance and various other things and reduction of circulating lipids or lipids in the livers and things like that.

A rep speaking about Dorsey's comments tells NBC News that "opening offices will be our decision. When and if our employees come back, will be theirs." BuzzFeed News obtained the email Dorsey sent, which stated the opening of offices would likely happen in September at the earliest; they've been closed since early March.

No one knows for sure. The Fed's broad efforts, which in a normal economy would likely accelerate inflation, may or may not be enough to keep prices from falling. Yet if consumers and businesses avoid spending at anything near normal levels for many more months in light of continued shutdowns, persistent unemployment and fears about the virus, a bout of deflation would become more likely. Most analysts have said they believe that sustained economic growth won't resume until sometime next year, perhaps after a vaccine or an effective drug therapy is available and can be widely distributed.

Ellington Financial, with its diversified, less levered portfolio, which included lots of liquid Agency assets and which in credit included a concentration of lower LTV loans, was able to weather the storm. While we absolutely have work to do resolving assets, where either the borrower or the property are experiencing a loss of income, we are pleased with the performance of most parts of our portfolio. And while the Agency MBS market did not escape unscathed, our disciplined approach kept our net loss in our Agency portfolio under 10% on allocated capital for the quarter. I want to review how the team managed the portfolio when the crisis hit. Firstly, we recognized relatively early on that the spread of COVID represented the kind of scary unpredictable news that the market really struggles to rationally price.

NEW YORK (AP) — Simon & Schuster CEO Carolyn Reidy, who presided over her company with steady force and a passion for books during a time of frequent and traumatic change, died Tuesday morning at age 71.
 Her death, from a heart attack, was announced by Dennis Eulau, the company’s chief operating officer and chief financial officer.
 “Carolyn was both an exemplary leader and a supremely talented and visionary publishing executive,” Eulau said in a statement about Reidy, who joined Simon & Schuster in 1992 and had served as CEO since 2008. “As a publisher and a leader, Carolyn pushed us to stretch to do just that little bit more; to do our best and then some for our authors, in whose service she came to work each day with an unbridled and infectious enthusiasm and great humor.”
 Simon & Schuster is one of the so-called “Big Five” New York based publishers, with authors including Stephen King, Doris Kearns Goodwin and Bob Woodward, who in an email to The Associated Press called her “One of the great publishers and book people of all time” and praised her as “both tough and generous.” On Twitter, novelist Jennifer Weiner noted that she had worked with Reidy for her whole career.
 “She was a trailblazer and a role model and a champion for me and so many other women,” Weiner wrote of Reidy, who at the time of her death was the only woman running one of the Big Five publishers. “Most of all, she was a smart and passionate reader.”
 Reidy confronted many crises and upheavals at Simon & Schuster, whether the rise of e-books, the financial crash of 2008 that happened within months of her becoming CEO or the current coronavirus pandemic. Earlier this year, ViacomCBS CEO Bob Bakish said the publisher was up for sale, telling an investor conference, “Simon & Schuster is not a core asset. It’s not video based."

Thanks Mark. While an economic return of negative 16% for a quarter is painful to say the least, I'm extremely proud of how our team managed through the unprecedented challenges of the quarter, especially given that leveraged credit portfolios were in the crosshairs of the distress in the financial markets. Our liquidity management, risk management and hedges did what they're designed to do. They protected book value and they protected our shareholders. This past quarter, that meant protecting our shareholders not only by avoiding any forced asset sales, but it also meant protecting our shareholders by avoiding any expensive or highly dilutive capital raises.

I think we have a lot of flexibility there, actually. So I don't think we feel pressure from a REIT testing perspective. But I think I mentioned earlier that we're not going to sell at the wrong time, and we're going to make sure if we sell the non-REIT qualifying assets that it makes sense versus what we can replace that capital with. But I think when you think about, again, what businesses we see as having longer-term opportunities in terms of supply demand imbalance, in terms of the competition being hobbled, it's in a lot of those loan strategies. So I don't want to make a prediction in the short-term, but in the long term, certainly, I would think that, that is where we would ultimately be heading the company. And I think that's consistent, frankly, with where we were pre-COVID.

 As we begin a new week in May during a year that has already seen so much heartache, it's important to take a moment and recognize yesterday [Saturday, May 9] concluded National Teacher Appreciation Week. In school systems, it is also known as staff appreciation week.
 Just the mention of COVID-19 and remote learning, brings on a new appreciation of teachers and support staff. During no other period in our lifetimes have we as parents had to become teachers and rely on the support and care of the professionals.
 Teachers have had to adapt overnight to the unknown and prepare for remote learning. While I am keenly aware of the important role educators play in a child's life, the heart and soul they are giving during this pandemic is monumental.
 The closing of school districts across the commonwealth has brought a range of emotions to teachers, students, parents, and educators alike. From the seniors who have been gypped out of their final months of school, not knowing the fate of prom and graduation, to the teachers who have cared for and comforted those students, we are writing history. Never before have I seen educators and communities come together like this for our students.
 Every staff member in a school system needs to be recognized. From the secretaries, to the nurses, social workers, teachers, teacher assistants, guidance counselors, therapists, food service workers, custodians, and technology specialists, a school system cannot operate without you. The world has a new found respect for you!

In securities, I would say that the situation is definitely clearer. And that securities repo, we've -- I don't want to say that it's been business as usual, but we really have not had significant issues rolling securities repo. Loan repo, again, we've been ahead of the game, staying ahead of the game. But the availability and terms, exactly what we're going to see in the future -- but let's just take non-QM, for example, right? So we have some nice term repo on non-QM right now. So we've got, we think, ample runway there, but nobody can predict exactly where that repo market is going to settle in. Nor -- and it's going to be related to the securitization market as well, right? So there's still non-QM out there in the marketplace, sitting online awaiting securitization. And there have been some distressed sales, as you may or may not have heard about, especially in March. So we have to see how that will play out. And that's going to affect the rates that the non-QM borrowers are going to pay, right, it all sort of is a cycle, if you will.

So how do you do that? I think the experience in the past couple of months gives us even stronger incentive to do securitizations as a way to transform repo financing into nonmark-to-market term financing. There are plenty of times in the cost and time commitment of doing securitizations make it seems like they may not be worth it. But in times like March 2020, having done them was well worth it. If all the non-QM loans that we had securitized over the past two years have been sitting on our balance sheet finance with repo, we would have had to reserve a lot more cash or potential margin calls. Secondly, so far, the loans we've sourced from origination channels where we've carefully chosen our partners and help shape the underwriting guidelines seems to be performing well relative to their peer group. So we are more inclined to continue to look for partnerships where we aligned and work in tandem with the originator to make credit decisions.

On the second floor, investigative-unit chief Christopher Kalka said his 27 investigators were also putting in long hours. People who witness suspicious deaths are now asked whether the deceased complained of losing their sense of smell or taste, which are possible symptoms of COVID-19.
 All homicides require an autopsy. Most COVID-19 deaths don’t, as a hospital records review is considered sufficient.
 Not all COVID-19 cases are clear cut. Pathologists concluded in one man’s death that the virus didn’t directly kill him, but that it affected his balance. He then fell and broke his hip, causing fatal complications.
 Doing fewer autopsies in COVID-19 cases reduces staff exposure to the virus. Risk of infection from the dead is low since it is often transmitted via spray from a sneeze or cough. No one who works at the office has tested positive.
 Staff didn’t conduct an autopsy on the inmate who was allegedly involved in the barroom brawl. They gave his body a swab test like the ones given to the living to confirm the presence of the virus, though they did it in a room with reduced air pressure so that viruses can’t seep out.
 His body was wheeled into a smaller refrigerated unit for coronavirus deaths, an orange biohazard tag affixed to his body bag.
 At an afternoon conference call to talk through the day’s cases, Arunkumar sat alone with other pathologists phoning in. Pathologists mostly review records from home these days to reduce the risk of spreading the virus at the office.
 One said she had more than 80 cases to review, including many COVID-19 cases.
 “This is absurd,” she said without anger.
 Upgrades at the office in recent years have helped avert crippling backlogs during the pandemic. Changes included putting records online. That’s enabled staff to work from home and clear cases faster.
 A key to operations now is a perishable-goods warehouse that was converted to a temporary morgue. National Guard troops unloaded bodies on the day the AP visited. Medical examiner's office staffers measured and photographed the bodies at the loading dock before soldiers took the body bags to one of three rooms the combined size of a football field. They laid them gently on specially constructed scaffolding.
 One room held 130 bodies, but the site can hold up to 2,000. Two of the three rooms were mostly empty — an encouraging sign amid the grimness.
 Raspante worked seven-day weeks for several weeks at the makeshift morgue before recently getting days off. When her kids ask about her job, she doesn't tell them she’s among the dead all day, every day.
 “I tell them that I help hospitals learn why people get sick,” she said.
 Death is in the job description, but that doesn’t mean those who work at the medical examiner's office are unmoved by the surge in dead, Arunkumar said. They cope by checking on each other more. Staff also adhere to a strict rule: Treat the dead with the respect they’d want extended to their own loved-ones.
 Doing that “makes it easier to handle what we are doing," she said.

There was an implementation in the Great Recession of '08, '09, of I'd say, across the board cuts in marketing. And we chose to take a different approach this time because it really is a function of the effectiveness and the yield of that spend. So one of the things, particularly with the cloud business, since that's where most of that spend originates, is to really look at it day-by-day and week by week. So we are monitoring the effectiveness of this spend, we're making judgments about the LTV of the customers acquired.

Petaluma’s Dana Thomsen has experienced softball on all levels, from youth to high school to Santa Rosa Junior College to D1 college and, for a brief time, even club in New Zealand.
 But, until last spring, she had never experienced it from a coaching viewpoint.
 Thomsen has come full circle from dominance in the circle at Petaluma High all the way back to the dugout as a coach for the T-Girls.
 One of the best pitchers ever at Petaluma High, Thomsen dreamed about pitching in college “ever since I was a little girl,” she said, but the dream didn’t exactly follow a straight line and it didn’t come without a lot of effort.
 In her two seasons of pitching for the T-Girls, she had a 30-4 record with a 1.02 earned run average with 277 strikeouts and just 37 walks. In her senior season (2013) she was the All-Empire Player of the Year.
 She originally committed to Humboldt State. When that didn’t work out, she took her pitching skills to Santa Rosa Junior College. It turned out to be one of the wisest career decisions she ever made.
 “I wouldn’t trade my JC experience for the world,” Thomsen said. “My first year there was an eye opener. I was with girls who worked heart and soul to go on to the D1 level, and they were working hard to replace me.”
 Despite the intense competition both from within her own team and from the opposition, Thomsen was successful for the Bear Cubs. In her first season she was 15-4 with a 2.73 earned run average. She struck out 83 batters and walked just 17. She followed up by going 17-11 with a 2.08 earned run average with 239 strikeouts and just 31 walks in her sophomore season.
 The next step was the University of Hawaii and another step up the competitive ladder.
 “It was crazy,” she recalled. “The girls all loved the sport and they all worked hard. I loved it. For me, it was perfect.”
 After a season of adjustment as a junior, the Petaluman stepped in as the team’s ace in the third week of her senior season when the Rainbows’ No. 1 pitcher went down with a season-ending injury.
 Thomsen responded with a 15-16 record, 3.02 ERA in 197⅓ innings spread over 36 innings that included 23 complete games. She had six shutouts with 146 strikeouts and just 54 walks. She was chosen Big West Pitcher of the Week after pitching two consecutive complete-game shutouts over Cal Poly.
 While carrying the pitching load for the Rainbows, she found time to earn Best West and University of Hawaii Scholar-Athlete honors.
 She also showed that a Petaluma girl could not be intimidated by pitching against teams like California, Tennessee, BYU and Cal Poly. “The name across your chest doesn’t make you the better player,” she said.
 For Thomsen, success didn’t just happen. There were long days in the gym, in the weight room and on the pitching rubber, all the while keeping up her GPA in the classroom. “Those days were a long grind,” she said, “but I would do it all over again in a heartbeat.”
 Then there was the month she spent as an “import” player pitching in a league in New Zealand. “That was so crazy,” she said. “I played against players from all over the world.”

In the Nets’ overtime win, Petrovic played all 53 minutes while scoring 35 points with five assists and five steals. He shot 12-for-18 overall and 4-for-5 from 3-point range. For a sign of the times, note that the Nets shot 4-for-6 from 3-point range from the game. Aside from Petrovic, they launched just one 3-pointer.
 Derrick Coleman had 20 points, 22 rebounds, five assists and three blocks, taking as many free throws — 11 — as field goals, making 10 from the line. Anderson had 16 points and eight assists in the win and Sam Bowie had 12 points and 10 rebounds.
 With a March surge, the Nets were 39-26 and in fourth place in the Eastern Conference, but Petrovic was injured the next night against Washington and missed two weeks with a knee sprain. A late slide that began while Petrovic was out left the Nets with a 43-39 record and tied for sixth in the Eastern Conference. They dropped their first-round playoff series against third-seeded Cleveland, 3-2.
 In his final NBA season, Petrovic averaged 22.3 points while shooting 51.8 percent overall and 44.9 percent from 3-point range, this time third in the league. He and Coleman were both named to the All-NBA Third Team, with Coleman averaging 20.7 points and 11.2 rebounds. Anderson, a rookie the season before, averaged 16.9 points and 8.2 assists in his first season as the starting point guard.
 Petrovic’s career 3-point percentage of 43.7 is fifth in NBA history and first in Nets franchise history. His 44.9 3-point percentage in 1992-93 was a Nets single-season record until it was surpassed by Joe Harris in 2018-19, but with his 44.4 mark of 1991-92 he holds two of the top four single-season 3-pont shooting percentages in Nets history.
 "He taught me a little just by looking at him, he taught me how to be a pro, you know, coming early, leaving late, working on things that, you know, your shot and working on your body," said Anderson. "(He) was real quiet and I got to know him a little bit, but not like I wanted to, you know, but he was a, I’m talking about, he left (the) Portland Trail Blazers, who gave him that pro mentality, I believe, and he brought it to him with the Nets and um, he worked extremely hard, he was a good guy, he was just a great guy."
 Petrovic’s No. 3 jersey was retired by the Nets in 1993, and he was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2002.

WORCESTER -- Polar Park is awakening from an unplanned hibernation.
 City Manager Edward M. Augustus Jr. has given the OK for work to resume this week on some construction projects here, Polar Park being one of them. What happens next, what does the resumption of work mean for the immediate and longer range future?
 That's a different story.
 In a prepared statement, Worcester Red Sox chairman Larry Lucchino said this:
 "While we look forward to resuming the construction of Worcester's new ballpark, we recognize that precautions, health, and safety remain paramount. We will support our local construction workers, and we will abide by the conditions set forth by our leaders to ensure an environment that complies with their public policy and expert medical recommendations.
 "We will save an assessment of the delay and the adverse impacts for another day."
 Due to a surge in COVID-19 infections and deaths, work was stopped on the ballpark on April 1, two weeks after the first steel went up. The hiatus was originally supposed to end on May 4, but the continuing battle with the virus delayed that for a week.
 All told the delay will have cost the project about six weeks.
 "The city, the Worcester Red Sox, Skanska, and Gilbane-Hunt are working collaboratively to best manage the resumption of Polar Park construction," Augustus said in a statement. "Gilbane-Hunt has issued their mandatory COVID-19 Safety Plan and it meets or exceeds CDC and State guidelines. They are also required to sign an affidavit confirming compliance to all COVID-19 procedures. The four parties are working to assess any impact of both the construction delay and the implementation of the safety protocols on the cost and/or timeline of the project.
 "This evaluation will continue concurrently with the remobilization and restart to construction and will be further clarified pending the results of that work over the coming weeks."
 At the time the project was halted, the ballpark was essentially on target for the opening of the 2021 season. However, getting it done by next spring was going to be a tight fit and there was not a lot of leeway in the timetable. Finishing Polar Park by next April will depend on how quickly the construction crew can catch up, if the virus levels don't become elevated again and halt work, and how benign the weather is.
 Meanwhile, there is no indication of when the International League will resume play in 2020, if at all. The minor leagues can't play "studio" games in empty stadiums like Major League Baseball. No doubt the minors would be onboard with an extended schedule into September and October beyond their traditional closing date of Labor Day, but the majors would have to agree to that.
 The Pawtucket Red Sox remain actively in business, just not the baseball business. Their full-time employees are working from home and none have been furloughed or laid off. The team has been heavily involved in community projects and intends to continue with that as the year progresses.
 McCoy Stadium is being kept up and the playing field is in excellent shape, awaiting someone to run the bases.
 Up here, work has resumed on just building some basepaths.
 "We are no doubt pleased at the City Manager's news," Lucchino said, "not only for WooSox fans and those looking forward to Polar Park, but because it is a step forward in the community's recovery from this striking scourge."
 Augustus said that the health of the Polar Park's workforce is the key to how things progress, adding, "That will serve as the guiding principle in the decision-making process."
 It is a process that could be long one, extending certainly into next spring and perhaps beyond.

Games were being played at the academy when the news broke of Bryant's death. Players immediately stopped and many people in the gym burst into tears when told that Bryant was aboard the helicopter that crashed.
 The academy is under consideration as a home base for the G League’s new select program, which is scheduled to begin in the fall. The program will serve as a one-year prepping, both on and off the court, for certain elite players who chose to bypass college but are not yet eligible for the NBA draft.
 Bryant is the only NBA player to have his team retire two numbers in his honour. He was selected last month for enshrinement into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, a ceremony that is still scheduled for late August though may be delayed until at least October because of the coronavirus pandemic. He was chosen in his first year of eligibility, along with fellow longtime NBA greats Tim Duncan and Kevin Garnett.
 Bryant’s production company, Granity Studios, has remained active since his death. The latest children’s book released by Bryant’s company last month — “The Wizenard Series: Season One” — became his fifth book to reach No. 1 on The New York Times’ bestseller lists.

“Stay at home” orders are not enough if you have symptoms. Solitary confinement is required. Nearly all infections are from airborne viral particles — only 6% comes from contaminated surfaces. Airborne particles come from more than sneezes or coughs. Just talking face to face for 5 minutes could spread an infection. Louder talking in a group and singing publicly would spread more. The threat of exposure in an interior space is far greater than in the outdoors where the particles disperse more quickly.
 Back to the asymptomatic group, perhaps 40% of all infections, testing won’t do it. Tests are good, but in the short term there is no way that everyone can be tested. Even if they could, if you test OK today, you might not be tomorrow.

We don't know what the length and severity of the economic downturn will be, what the ultimate path to recovery will look like and what the exact effects of all this will be on our current portfolio or on future investments. And on the liability side, it's unclear what the exact terms and availability of financing for these assets will be.

It was 51 years ago this past July. I was a happy kid of 13 and had worked for a year selling Katydids candies door to door. I sold enough to save $350. That was the cost of attending the National Jamboree in Farragut State Park south of Coeur d’Alene, Idaho. Seven thousand of us Boy Scouts stayed in Camp E.K. Fretwell. The year was 1969.
 We left from North Platte in a chartered bus, and, wow, were we excited.
 Camping out as much as possible, I think our first night was in the basement of a church in Helena, Mont. We camped near St. Mary’s Lake in Glacier National Park. I remember Rex Pilger (I think that was his name) making all of us take a bath in the lake with soap and water because there were bear attacks that summer in Glacier. We tried to soap up, but the water was so cold. I don’t think anyone washed away the morning smells of breakfast. I stayed awake all night thinking of all the bacon I’d eaten that day.
 We toured Virginia City, Mont., where Rankin gave us each a dollar in dimes to play all the mechanical antique music boxes. Man, that was so cool! We toured a working sawmill and the Anaconda Copper Mines near Butte, and went down into the Grand Coulee Dam. We spent one night 10 years to the day at Earth Quake Lake (Hebken Lake) where a 7.5-magnitude earthquake had killed 22 campers in 1959. I stayed awake that night, too!
 It was the trip of a lifetime, and all the while we were shepherded by Scoutmaster Rankin and a few other good men.
 The National Jamboree was amazing: swimming in Lake Pend Oreille and seeing Up With People and hearing 1936 Olympic sprinter Jesse Owens speak. Owens was the famous black American who made Adolf Hitler angry by outperforming the “master race” Germans in the 1936 Olympics. These were highlights of the Jamboree, which was one of the biggest events of our lifetimes.

When Governor Inslee’s March 12 COVID-19 announcement prompted school closures across Washington State, distance learning took on immediate importance. Schools, teachers, parents and students have had to assess the tools and techniques on hand, discover what was still needed and create ways to fill any gaps discovered along the way. The teamwork needed to implement new paths to learning, and the innovative digital learning centers that are growing, open doors and create connections throughout the school community.
 Seattle Jewish Community School (SJCS) and other Seattle-area Jewish day schools had pre-empted the directive by soft launching their remote learning program days earlier, seeking feedback from students, parents and teachers and getting everyone up to speed.
 “It was like I had hired 12 brand-new teachers despite the decades of seniority and experience they had,” says Head of School Ron Waldman. “In this format, all bets are off. None of our educators had ever been trained for this type of teaching and learning and not all children can easily adapt to continuous learning.” Even though they’ve had their challenges, Seattle Jewish Community School – along with Northwest Yeshiva High School (NYHS), Jewish Day School (JDS) and Seattle Hebrew Academy (SHA) – are making it work, teaching students important lessons and forging strong communities at the same time.

 Rangers was among the clubs to strongly oppose the SPFL proposal. As was Hearts, which stands to be relegated from the Premiership if it is curtailed.
 “It is clear that many members have lost confidence in the SPFL leadership and the need for change will not diminish,” Rangers said in a statement.

According to Zacks, "Salesforce has been benefiting from a robust demand environment as customers are undergoing a major digital transformation. The rapid adoption of its cloud-based solutions is driving demand for its products. Continued deal wins in the international market is another growth driver. Furthermore, Salesforce's recent acquisition of Tableau positions the company to be a leader in business analytics for actionable results in everything from operations to HR. However, stiff competition from Oracle and Microsoft is a concern. Besides, increasing investments in international expansions and data centers are an overhang on near-term profitability. Shares of the company have underperformed the industry in the past year."

This intriguing TV adaptation lives independently from the movie. It shares ingredients like the constant mentions to Wilford, Snowpiercer's mastermind. Both address the addiction to a drug called Kronole and use human-size drawers as a form of population confinement.
 But the TV show is less crude and disturbing. Its violence is less stylized. There's no chatter about how babies taste. It doesn't feel the need to spell out the ingredients of the protein blocks fed to the 400 souls in the Tail as dramatically as the movie does.
 The TV version of Snowpiercer made me think about the delicate balance between power's capacity to corrupt and the needs of the greater good. All while keeping me entertained and rooting for most characters, even if they were on opposite sides of the conflict brewing on board. The show also finds room for welcome moments of human connection, including romance and sex.
 Music is sparsely used and wielded with deliberate intent. Like the vinyl version of Sealed with a Kiss by Bobby Vinton one of the characters in first has the liberty to play. Or the version of Frank Ocean's Bad Religion the madame of the Nightcar sings in front of a hypnotized audience.
 Survival is insufficient. Fortunately, we still have scripted TV.

The Arizona Coyotes have parted ways with president and chief executive officer Ahron Cohen, The Athletic's Craig Morgan reported on Tuesday.
 A specific reason was not announced for the Coyotes' decision to part ways with Cohen, who joined the franchise in August 2015. Cohen served as the club's chief operating officer and chief legal officer before being elevated to the position of president and CEO in July 2018, replacing Steve Patterson.
 The move comes nearly a year removed from billionaire businessman Alex Meruelo purchasing the Coyotes from Andrew Barroway in July. Meruelo holds a 95 percent stake in the club.
 Per Morgan, the coaching staff is expected to return "intact next season, the final year of head coach Rick Tocchet's contract."
 The Coyotes owned a 33-29-8 record (74 points) and sat in fifth place in a congested Pacific Division when the NHL paused its season due to the coronavirus pandemic in March. They resided in 11th place overall in the Western Conference, four points behind the Nashville Predators for the final postseason spot.
 The franchise last made the playoffs when the club was called the Phoenix Coyotes in 2011-12. They advanced to the Western Conference Finals before falling in five games to the eventual Stanley Cup champion Los Angeles Kings.

WASHINGTON (AP) — La presidenta de la Cámara de Representantes, Nancy Pelosi, presentó el martes un paquete de ayuda de unos 3 billones de dólares y exhortó al Congreso a mostrarse “generoso” con la ayuda a los estados faltos de dinero y la gente que sufre por causa del coronavirus. La Ley de Héroes brinda casi 1 billón de dólares a estados, ciudades y gobiernos tribales para evitar despidos, y otros 200.000 millones en “pago por trabajo insalubre” a los trabajadores esenciales, de acuerdo con un resumen. Incluye 1.200 millones en ayuda directa a las personas, a razón de hasta 6.000 dólares por hogar. Otros 75.000 millones serían para tests de diagnóstico. La votación está prevista para el viernes. El líder del bloque demócrata, Steny Hoyer, dijo que el proyecto presentado por su partido “estará listo a tiempo” para convocar a los legisladores para la votación en Washington. “Ésta es una época sin precedentes en nuestra historia”, dijo Hoyer con referencia al brote de coronavirus y el cierre de la economía. Acotó que el Congreso debe actuar de “manera sin precedentes”. El proyecto se estrellará contra un muro en el Senado. Los senadores republicanos no planean votar sobre paquete de rescate alguno hasta junio, después del receso del 25 de mayo, cuando se conmemora a los caídos en guerras. El líder del bloque mayoritario, republicano, Mitch McConnell, dijo que no hay “urgencia” para votar. El nuevo paquete, el quinto desde marzo, previsiblemente llevará una factura enorme. El presidente Donald Trump ya ha firmado casi 3 billones de dólares en ayuda aprobada por el Congreso.

In-depth, if we analyze for the long-term EPS Growth, the out- come was 9.00% for the past five years and the scenario is totally different as the current prediction is 8.60% for the next five year.

For the first quarter of 2020, most of the company's net loss was caused by loss and loss adjustment expenses, but approximately two-thirds of those loss expenses recorded by MBIA Insurance Corporation and the other third by National Public Finance Guarantee Corporation. These elevated losses for the first quarter were modestly influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. While the pandemic has affected a wide range of economic activities and influenced a number of financial relief and social programs, given the nature of our insured credits and the terms of our insurance policies, the ultimate financial impact from most of the credits in our insurance portfolios is uncertain at this time. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have augmented our monitoring activities on a number of credits in our insurance portfolios.

La asociacion recuerda que las mascarillas deben contar con una "adecuada, completa y detallada informacion de la composicion del producto y de su eficacia real frente al riesgo de contagio del COVID-19, la tipologia de mascarilla de que se trate (higienica, quirurgica, FFP2, FFP3, etc.), asi como si puede ser reutilizable o lavable y la posible disminucion de eficacia tras su uso, o indicar expresamente sus limitaciones frente a la proteccion de contagio".
 Asi, la Union de Consumidores de la Comunitat Valenciana ha localizado a seis empresas, dos de ellas situadas fuera del territorio valenciano, que a su juicio comercializan por internet mascarillas "con informacion insuficiente e incompleta, pudiendo inducir a error a las personas consumidoras, en tanto a traves de texto o imagenes se atribuye cualidades frente al COVID-19 que pudieran no ser reales".  
 La lista, sujeta a una "posterior ampliacion", incluye a la empresa Closca, que se ha visto obligada a devolver el dinero a los clientes que compraron sus mascarillas, tal como informo este diario, MLS Textiles 1992 SL, la marca dE.LENZO o Salmeran Perfumes SL. Ademas, la asociacion de consumidores tambien señala a las empresas Moverte Innovacion y Accesibilidad SL, de Logroño, y a Epiformes SL, de Cadiz.
 El escrito, registrado este martes, denuncia que la venta de estos productos puede producir un "perjuicio economico y para la salud de las personas consumidoras, ademas de una infraccion de la normativa de defensa de los consumidores y usuarios".  
 Carlos Ferrando, CEO de Closca Design SL (la empresa que ha tenido que reembolsar el dinero de las mascarillas que comercializaba) asegura que ha sido victima de "la confusion en el mercado internacional". Ferrando, en declaraciones a eldiario.es, sostiene que su proveedor inicial en China les hizo llegar dos certificados firmados por un laboratorio chino y otro italiano que aseguraban que los filtros adquiridos eran FFP2.
 A mediados de abril "empezamos a dudar de esos certificados", tras las importaciones de productos que no cumplian los estandares por parte de varios gobiernos (entre ellos, el español).  
 "Ante esas dudas decidimos ir a un certificado y un fabricante español porque aqui en España los laboratorios tambien estan colapsos y no da tiempo a certificar un EPI, que tarda tres o cuatro meses", asegura Ferrando.
 El empresario valenciano asegura que se trata de un proyecto "sin beneficio neto y no lucrativo". "Todo lo que hacemos es intentar generar cambio social, nos podemos equivocar en la comunicacion pero nunca nos vamos a equivocar en intentar ofrecer a los clientes lo mejor", añade el propietario de Closca Design.
