 Carnahan stressed the importance of the election and asked supporters to help make it a "historic election."
 "Statewide, President Trump came within 1.5 points of defeating Hilary Clinton and won 78 of our 87 counties," Carnahan said, and "‚Ä¶ we have not delivered our 10 electoral votes to a Republican candidate for president since Richard Nixon in 1972.

MANKATO, Minn. (KEYC) - The pandemic has hit a lot of local business‚Äôs hard over the last couple of months with some temporarily closing and others shutting their doors for good.A majority of those businesses have had to think on their toes in order to keep serving the Mankato area.. The 507 and Tav on the Ave are prime examples of that.These two restaurants have made some changes to keep the revenue, customers and beer flowing.‚ÄúIt was very prevalent that we needed something to get more people on the patio and we did a very well job of the reopening of getting people out here. I think these are just added things that will keep us going longer and getting more people out here," The 507‚Ä≤s kitchen manager, Israel Pitchford said. The 507 looks to build on their ever-growing patio even with the season coming to an end in the next couple of months.‚ÄúWe did some things such as adding TV‚Äôs and space heaters. To make sure that we can accommodate to people outside and they can also enjoy their time here," Pitchford said. Tav on the Ave has adapted their business to better suit the normalcy the pandemic has brought.‚ÄúWe just launched our own delivery service within our own company here at MIO so that is something that we‚Äôre trying to get off the ground and do our own GrubHub kind of thing," Tav on the Ave‚Äôs general manager, Nick Oliver said. Online ordering and delivery were launched two weeks ago, but they‚Äôre already seeing the benefits of the program‚ÄúWe‚Äôve seen sales about the same as last year, but we‚Äôre replacing 30% of what we would have done in bar or drink sales with takeout and delivery. So, on a Friday night, we‚Äôre just as busy doing takeout as we are in the restaurant which is crazy," Oliver said. These restaurants show how resilient and driven the hospitality industry in this community is.Copyright 2020 KEYC. All rights reserved.

Nothing underscored that more than the early Williams fumble.
 ‚ÄúI had to get into my groove," Williams said. "We had to get into our groove."
 Notre Dame collectively shook free from that early Williams fumble, then scored on six of their next eight possessions. Anything offensive coordinator Tommy Rees dialed up seemed to hit. A Williams run. A Chris Tyree sweep. Ian Book working the tight ends. And a career night from Javon McKinley, the latest wide receiver flavor of the week. All of it added up to 554 yards of total offense.
 Saturday saw a big dose of Williams. A year ago, that early fumble would‚Äôve put his backside on the bench for the rest of the game, and maybe even the rest of the season. That‚Äôs what happened when he looked so unsure at Louisville in the 2019 opener. But Kelly and Rees stayed with Williams, and he delivered.
 ‚ÄúWe just reminded him of ball security,‚Äù Kelly said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a great competitor and he bounced back.‚Äù
 As much fight as Florida State showed, and as many yards as it gashed coordinator Clark Lea‚Äôs defense for (405 total yards), you never got the feeling that the Seminoles were going to do enough to make this _that_ interesting. They were close, yes, but never close enough. Even up in a near- deserted press box, the overall intrigue level barely registered.
 ‚ÄúThey were bringing it to us with the run game,‚Äù said Irish safety Kyle Hamilton, who tied for the team lead with eight tackles. ‚ÄúSlowly, they started to fade away. We got stronger as the game went on.‚Äù
 Other than Clemson next month, the previous three weeks might be the toughest opponent Notre Dame faces this season. There was the stop, then the restart, then the let's-get-back-in-game-mode urgency. That was hard on everyone, because no one knew what was coming next. More positive tests? A green light to get back to business?
 Doubt duked it out with determination. The determination won.
 Kelly said Saturday felt like a season opener, and in a lot of ways, it was. Teams don't play two games, then take three weeks off in any sport. The calendar‚Äôs heading toward the middle of October but this felt a lot like late August. So much uncertainty. There were sputters. There was some good stuff. Still, Notre Dame eventually had to restart and it did Saturday. The Irish worked through it and got past it. Now it‚Äôs time to go.
 Barely an hour after this one went final, the area surrounding the stadium was void of any evidence that a game had been played. Everything had cleared out and everyone had gone home. It was eerily quiet.
 What already has been an eventful and uneven season could use some of that. Some quiet. Some normalcy. Some routine.
 Saturday was a good start. Toward what, let's not even try to guess. It's football. Go play.

The rough edges for the Irish (3-0, 2-0 ACC) on Saturday night may turn out to be more mirage than malignant. But the best-case scenario of what this team could evolve into is almost as muddled in mid-October.
 Or at least disjointed.
 Given that No. 1 Clemson smothered seventh-ranked Miami on the stat sheet (550 yards to 210) and the scoreboard (42-17) Saturday night on a competing network is a reminder how urgent it is for the Irish to convincingly evolve between now and the Tigers‚Äô Nov. 7 visit to Notre Dame Stadium.
 A peek behind the curtain during the longest regular-season hiatus for Notre Dame‚Äî 21 days between games ‚Äî since the 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic shows that evolution was hardly at a standstill against Florida State.
 Just hidden.
 The conventional COVID-19 math heading into Saturday spit out that just two Irish regulars would not be available ‚Äî starting defensive tackle Myron Tagovailoa-Amosa and surging sophomore linebacker Jack Kiser.
 That was down from 39 players unavailable during the peak of the crisis that included a postponed game with Wake Forest and a nine-day hiatus from practice.
 ‚ÄúActually my first thought when the operation shut down was if I‚Äôm going to play again?‚Äù said grad senior Javon McKinley, a surprising force against the Seminoles (1-3, 0-3) with a career-high 107 receiving yards on five catches.
 A look at the Irish cornerback position helps tell the story of why this wasn‚Äôt a matter of a team with COVID hangover, but one still very much intertwined with the virus.
 Starting cornerback Nick McCloud wasn‚Äôt cleared until Thursday of this week ‚Äî too late to get any meaningful contact work. Same for freshman Clarence Lewis, who started the USF game Sept. 19, in place of game 1 starter TaRiq Bracy.
 McCloud‚Äôs backup, Cam Hart, wasn‚Äôt cleared until Friday.
 ‚ÄúSo it was TaRiq and a bunch of freshmen that really weren't particularly ready,‚Äù Kelly said. ‚ÄúShaun had played the position (prior to 2020). He was selfless in the sense that he moved over to the cornerback position and bailed us out in a very, very difficult time, playing a position that he hadn't been repping at all because he had played all those safety reps.‚Äù
 The 5-9 Crawford got burned on a 48-yard TD pass from first-time QB starter Jordan Travis to 6-4 receiver Tamorrion Terry as 21-point underdog Florida State took advantage of a couple of early Irish turnovers to surge ahead, 17-14, with 38 seconds left in the first quarter.
 But the sixth-year defensive back gathered himself and finished with two pass breakups, three tackles and an interception on third-and-goal from the 5 midway through the fourth quarter.
 ‚Äú(Crawford) has played more snaps than everybody in the DB room combined,‚Äù said safety Kyle Hamilton, who returned for a Sept. 12 ankle injury to co-lead the Irish in tackles with eight. ‚ÄúSo he‚Äôs seen a lot of football. He knows what he‚Äôs doing. You don‚Äôt really have to worry about him doing his job.

Kelly said the Irish called on Crawford, who later intercepted a pass at the goal line, to play cornerback because some of their other options weren‚Äôt quite ready to play following recent quarantine and isolation periods.
 Florida State‚Äôs offense was aided by a pair of Notre Dame fumbles that set up short fields for the Seminoles. Williams fumbled on the second play from scrimmage, which led to a Florida State field goal. Then Lawrence Keys III muffed a punt later in the first quarter, which led to a four-yard touchdown run by Travis.
 Still, the Irish defense ceded plenty of ground to the Seminoles. Travis finished 13-of-24 passing for 204 yards and one touchdown and led Florida State in rushing with 96 yards and one touchdown on 19 carries.
 Limiting the Seminoles to only one touchdown in the second half ‚Äî a seven-yard run by running back La‚ÄôDamian Webb ‚Äî allowed the Irish to put the game away.
 ‚ÄúOur defense did not have their 'A' game today,‚Äù Kelly said. ‚ÄúA lot of it has to do with a combination of really good players. And Travis, he played extremely well. They had a good scheme for him that made it difficult for us in terms of making some adjustments.
 ‚ÄúBut again, we gave them 10 points. We keep them to 16, that's not playing at our best. We can play much better. Some of that is attributed to obviously the layoff that we had.‚Äù
 The layoff may have actually helped Notre Dame‚Äôs passing game, which struggled to stretch the field in the first two games to open the season. When Book wanted to gain chunks through the air, he looked to fellow fifth-year Javon McKinley. The 6-foot-2, 215-pound wide receiver set a career high with 107 receiving yards on five receptions.
 ‚ÄúI wish I got a little more YAC (yards after the catch),‚Äù McKinley said, ‚Äúbut just to be able to get on the field and beat the man across from you and get open, catch some balls, get some yards, help my team out ‚Äî not just from blocking, but in the passing game ‚Äî it was fun.‚Äù
 McKinley, a former four-star recruit who didn‚Äôt catch a pass at Notre Dame until his true senior season, had most of his big moments last year in lopsided games against New Mexico, Bowling Green and Michigan. His biggest moments of the 2020 season before Saturday came as a blocker.
 Kelly called McKinley a beast during his postgame press conference and insisted McKinley needs to start playing with that kind of confidence. McKinley was waiting in the room as Kelly shoveled praise his way.
 ‚ÄúHe can't be defended,‚Äù Kelly said. ‚ÄúThere's nobody in college football that can defend that kid. (Asante) Samuel (Jr.) is one of the best corners in the country. He didn't have much of a chance defending him.
 ‚ÄúIf he just continues to work the way he's been working, he's been one of our better practice players, he is a great leader with those wide receivers. I've been telling him he's got a chance to do some special things.‚Äù
 Book said he was confident McKinley would win his matchups against Florida State. Delivering passes to McKinley allowed Book to finish with a line of 16-of-25 for 201 yards and two touchdowns and a season-best passing efficiency rating of 157.94. Book‚Äôs two touchdown passes went to freshman tight end Michael Mayer (eight yards for a career first TD) and junior wide receiver Braden Lenzy (six yards for a season first).
 Junior Kevin Austin Jr. (foot) and grad transfer Ben Skowronek (hamstring) made little impact with limited snaps and no catches. Clearly the Irish passing game has room to grow, but when the running game is working so well, that development might come a bit slower.
 As long as the Irish are playing physical, scoring points and winning games, that‚Äôs all right with Book.
 ‚ÄúWhen you're able to run like we were tonight, why would you want to stop something that's working like that?‚Äù Book said. ‚ÄúThat just helps open up the pass.
 ‚ÄúStrictly in the passing game, it's going fine. We can grow in the running game and in the passing game. Nothing specific.
 ‚ÄúWe're doing what we have to do to win. It's about winning football games. That's hard to do. I'm just happy to be out there, happy to be playing."

Stephen Kenny is hoping that Aaron Connolly will be available for Wednesday‚Äôs UEFA Nations League game in Finland after Adam Idah‚Äôs return to the squad was confirmed.

For uninsured Kansans, a window of opportunity opens next month.
   
 The open enrollment period for 2021 health insurance plans is set to begin Nov. 1 and run through Dec. 15. During that time, Kansans without health insurance may browse options available to them and purchase plans on the Health Insurance Marketplace.
   
 Plans available on the marketplace are compliant with regulations set forth in the Affordable Care Act, former President Barack Obama's health care law. There aren't repercussions for not purchasing a plan, as the ACA's individual mandate penalty has been $0 since the beginning of 2019, but health insurance experts like Louise Norris say it is important to get coverage.
   
 Norris has written about health insurance and health care reform since 2006 and authors "The Insider's Guide to Obamacare's Open Enrollment," which is published on healthinsurance.org
   
 Norris said when searching for a plan, Kansans should pay attention to premiums, out-of-pocket costs beyond just the deductible, providers covered by a network and a plan's drug formulary, which is the list of drugs covered by a policy.
   
 "If you're buying your own health insurance and you're shopping in the marketplace, you can rest assured that all of the plans cover the essential health benefits," Norris said. "They cap your out-of-pocket costs as long as you stay in network. They don't have lifetime or annual benefit maximums. Those sort of 'Gotchas' that used to exist in the individual market -- you don't have to worry about that anymore. And also, pre-existing conditions are covered from day one."
   
 According to data provided by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, nearly 86,000 people in Kansas enrolled in coverage for 2020 during the open enrollment period last year. That was down some from the almost 90,000 people in Kansas who had enrolled the year before.
   
 Norris said it is difficult to know how the pandemic will affect enrollment -- as it has been marked by both heightened health concerns and greater economic uncertainty -- but she doesn't expect enrollment to drop again.
   
 "I would really hesitate to give a prediction on what I think is going to happen with enrollment," Norris said, "but I would say we do still have definitely lower employment than we had last year at this time, heading into the last open enrollment period."
   
 And without employer-provided coverage, those individuals could be looking for care on their own.
   
 KanCare, the state's Medicaid program, is available for low-income individuals who also fall into one of several different eligibility categories: children, pregnant women, adult parents and caregivers, and seniors and the disabled.
   
 "In states where they've expanded Medicaid, low income is enough, as long as you're a non-elderly adult," Norris said. "That's not the case in Kansas."
   
 That leaves many people who fall short of KanCare guidelines searching for private plans on the marketplace.
   
 She said one of the concerns many people have about individual-market coverage is that premiums and out-of-pocket costs are too high.
   
 Plans that have higher premiums, Norris said, will usually have lower out-of- pocket costs, and plans with lower premiums tend to have high out-of-pocket costs.
   
 "But the ACA does include two mechanisms for protecting people from those," Norris said. "If your income is under 400% of the poverty level, in most cases you'll qualify for premium subsidies, and if your income is under 250% of the poverty level, you can get these plans with lower out-of-pocket costs as long as you pick a silver plan."
   
 Norris recommends steering clear of anything that isn't an ACA-compliant major medical plan, as consumers might not get the same protections under those non- compliant policies. Those include short-term plans that some people see as an alternative to ACA-compliant plans, she said.
   
 In Kansas, there are five insurers that offer ACA-compliant plans on the Health Insurance Marketplace. Those insurers include Blue Cross Blue Shield of Kansas, Cigna, Medica, Oscar and Sunflower Health Plan/Ambetter from Sunflower Health.
   
 "In most states, the companies that offer insurance through the marketplace will also let you come directly to them and buy a plan," Norris said. "You can totally do that, but the same open enrollment period applies. You have to do it between Nov. 1 and Dec. 15. Outside of that, they will not sell you a plan unless you have a qualifying event. And you cannot get any subsidies if you go directly to those insurance companies, so that's really only a good alternative if you know you earn too much money to qualify for subsidies."

Benton was again stripped of a committee chair this year over remarks he made on a radio show following the death of U.S. Rep. John Lewis, the long-serving Georgia Democrat and prominent civil rights leader. Referring to Bloody Sunday, the 1965 incident in which Alabama state troopers attacked peaceful voting rights marchers on a Selma bridge and fractured Lewis's skull, Benton said Lewis's "only claim to fame was that he got conked on the head at the [Edmund] Pettus Bridge ‚Ä¶ and he has milked that for 50 years." Benton was arguing against replacing one of Georgia's two official statutes at the U.S. Capitol -- a marble likeness of Alexander Stephens, former Georgia governor and vice president of the Confederacy -- with one of Lewis.

What Williams did know, what he reminded himself at the team‚Äôs downtown hotel, was that it still was football, something Williams has been playing since second grade back in St. Louis. Don't overthink everything. Just go play.
 Still, Saturday was different, as different as it‚Äôs ever been for this group for the first and hopefully the last time in what already has been a strange college football season. How strange? The post-game Zoom press conference format proved a little more problematic for the Irish and coach Brian Kelly than the previous three-plus hours against the Seminoles.
 Kind of.
 Florida State offered its share of concerns, and it didn‚Äôt help when the Williams fumble was an express trip to an early Irish deficit. But that‚Äôs the way this one was going to go. Some good moments. Some not-so-good moments. There were times when Notre Dame looked a lot like the fifth-ranked team in the country. There were times when it looked like a team that had sat around too many days and collectively wondered if they would ever get back to something like Saturday.
 This one wasn‚Äôt going to be pretty. Not from your view from the couch in front of the television at home. Or in the sparse stands of Notre Dame Stadium. Not even from the ninth-floor press box on the stadium‚Äôs east side, which felt like a house where the tenants had long moved out and had left only a few work chairs. And a couple dozen hot dogs.
 You can't put any football team, let alone a collection of college kids, on ice for three weeks the way the Irish were forced to cool it and expect them to pick up where they left off. It doesn‚Äôt happen.
 Notre Dame (3-0; 2-0 Atlantic Coast Conference) showed some signs of rust, but way more signs of resilience. In the same game. Sometimes, in the same series. The Irish weren‚Äôt great, but current events being current events weren‚Äôt going to let them be. Not Saturday. Not yet.
 ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt have our ‚ÄòA' game,‚Äù Kelly said in his post-game radio interview. ‚ÄúThere are a lot of reasons for that. It‚Äôs not something I want to do again.‚Äù
 Yet the Irish proved they could do it. Teams like Notre Dame have plenty to win with and win easily with when it‚Äôs a ‚ÄòB‚Äô or ‚ÄòC‚Äô game.
 No matter what the Seminoles did, and there were moments when they did a lot, there never was any sense that the Irish were in trouble. Like, uh-oh, here's where it all goes sideways. This game. This season. This everything. Not with this team. There's too much experience. Too much talent. Too much resolve. Too much everything.
 The Irish weren‚Äôt game ready. They weren't sharp. They tried to be, but probably overworked themselves trying to get there. You could see it on defense. You could see it on special teams. You could sense it. The Irish fought through it and wouldn‚Äôt allow the layoff to be a crutch. Gotta go play, so play.

PITTSBURGH - The text message Steelers wide receiver Chase Claypool received from quarterback Ben Roethlisberger on Friday couldn't have been more direct.
 ‚ÄúI just told him just keep doing what you‚Äôre doing and you‚Äôre going to have a big game,‚Äù Roethlisberger said.
 A historic one too.
 The Canadian-born Claypool scored four touchdowns, including the clincher on a 35-yard dart from Roethlisberger with 2:59 to go, and the Steelers remained unbeaten with a 38-29 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday.
 The 22-year-old second-round pick out of Notre Dame dashed into the end zone on a 2-yard jet sweep in the first quarter, sprinted away from defenders on a 32-yard catch-and-run in the second, danced across the goal line on a 5-yard wide receiver screen in the third and finished off Philadelphia in the fourth when Roethlisberger audibled to a play Claypool had never run before, at least while lined up in the slot.
 At the snap, however, the 6-foot-4, 238-pounder from Abbotsford, B.C., never hesitated, racing past overmatched Eagles linebacker Nate Gerry and into the end zone.
 ‚ÄúWe changed the play,‚Äù Roethlisberger said. "I can‚Äôt say enough about Chase getting down the middle of the field and make a play for us.‚Äù
 Claypool became the first Steelers player to score four times in a game since wide receiver Roy Jefferson did it in 1968. He's also the first rookie since at least 1950 to catch three touchdowns and add another on the ground and the first Canadian to have three receiving touchdowns in one game since Joe Rooney of the Duluth Eskimos on Oct. 23, 1927, six years before the Steelers were established and more than seven decades before Claypool was born.
 ‚ÄúIt is definitely insane, it‚Äôs crazy,‚Äù said Claypool, who hauled in seven passes for 110 yards and added 6 yards rushing on three carries. "But I don‚Äôt really like to think about breaking records or making history. It‚Äôs super cool but it‚Äôs not something I go into the game thinking ‚ÄòI‚Äôm going to try to make history today.‚Äô‚Äù
 The Steelers (4-0) needed every one of them after nearly squandering a 17-point third-quarter lead while letting the Eagles (1-3-1) convert 10 straight third downs.
 Carson Wentz threw for 258 yards and two scores to go with two interceptions and moved Philadelphia in position to take the lead with just over three minutes to play. Jake Elliott's 57-yard field-goal attempt drifted right, however, and Roethlisberger turned to Claypool one last time.
 Pittsburgh took over and a personal foul facemask by the Eagles pushed the Steelers into Philadelphia territory. Facing third-and-8 from the Eagles 35, Claypool ‚Äî who'd had a touchdown earlier in the quarter called back due to what he called an ‚Äúawful‚Äù offensive pass interference call ‚Äî listened to Roethlisberger's instructions and found himself against the smaller, slower Gerry. Next thing he knew Roethlisberger was looking his way ‚Äî again ‚Äî and he was in the end zone.
 Again.
 ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got to make those plays,‚Äù Claypool said. "(Roethlisberger) is trusting you. He‚Äôs putting the ball where it needs to be. You make the plays and the trust builds faster.‚Äù
 Eagles running back Miles Sanders ran for 80 yards and two scores in his return to his hometown. Travis Fulgham caught 10 passes for 152 yards and a touchdown to give Philadelphia's injury-ravaged receiving group a needed boost but the defence forced just one punt after the first quarter and allowed the Steelers to convert 11 of 15 third downs.

Carson Wentz and Philadelphia‚Äôs injury-depleted offense put up 29 points against the Pittsburgh Steelers and still lost. The Eagles fell to 1-3-1 with a 38-29 loss to the Steelers (4-0) following a dismal defensive performance Sunday. Ben Roethlisberger picked apart the secondary, took advantage of coverage mismatches and tossed three touchdowns to rookie Chase Claypool. ‚ÄúWe pride ourselves on if we score 3, it don‚Äôt matter (because) they shouldn‚Äôt touch the end zone,‚Äù defensive end Brandon Graham said. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt hold up our end of the bargain. It can‚Äôt be only one side clicking. We have to be more consistent.‚Äù The Steelers converted 73% (11 for 15) on third downs, including TD passes from Roethlisberger to Claypool of 32 yards on third-and-6 and 35 yards on third-and-8. Linebacker Nate Gerry inexplicably was left to cover Claypool one-on-one on the 35-yard TD that sealed the win in the fourth quarter. ‚ÄúIdeally, would we like Nate to be on a receiver? No,‚Äù safety Rodney McLeod said. ‚ÄúWe would prefer a defensive back but that was the call defensively and they checked to a good play. ... That‚Äôs a tough play for Nate going against a receiver like Claypool. Ben saw it and we have to live with that play.‚Äù Cornerback Darius Slay was called for two pass interference penalties. The first one negated an incomplete pass on second-and-16 that set up Pittsburgh‚Äôs first touchdown. Philadelphia‚Äôs highly touted and highly paid defensive line only sacked Roethlisberger once and didn‚Äôt generate much pressure. ‚ÄúThe ball was coming out fast,‚Äù Graham said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs respect for us. They were hitting the perimeter. We need to make sure we tackle. They try to take the D-line out of the game. That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre going to see moving forward so we...

 On this International Day of the Girl Child, 11th October 2020 of which the theme for this year's celebration is "My Voice, My equal opportunity", the Initiative is urging all to get involved in the movement of ensuring that girls and women have the voice to speak up when in situations of vulnerability and subjugation and the inability to be heard.
 The Initiative is pushing forward to ensuring that girls and women have access to the opportunities available to them. According to the former Prime Minister of New Zealand, Helen Clark, the gender gap in terms of access to opportunities in Africa causes the continent about $95 billion every year. This tells us that, women empowerment is not about challenging status-quo and trying to rub shoulders with men but it's for the collective good of all, the desire to see a better society where poverty becomes a thing of the past and the whole of humanity benefits in a positive direction.
