"There was definitely a backlash," Price says -- to say the least -- "but I think that maybe the Opry deleted a lot of the comments on the post that they put up about me" on Facebook. (The responses on other platforms are still there, for anyone who wants to look them up.) "It was just a photo of me and everybody was like, 'How dare she come on here and disgrace the sacred circle.' But the Opry, themselves… they all came by my dressing room afterwards. And I mean, I was shaking. I was trembling. I was really nervous because, days before I even played the Opry, I knew I was going to say something, and I kind of had it planned out what I was going to say. And then, yeah, there were all sorts of nasty things hurled at me through Twitter and Instagram. But like I said, the Opry members came by my dressing room, and they thanked me for my performance. And then they sent me a very nice letter thanking me for my speech. So that really meant a lot."

GRAVES COUNTY, KY — Should the Graves County jail close?
 That's the issue the county's fiscal court is discussing and financial shortfalls.
 The fiscal court said the main issue is overspending. The fiscal court said the jail went over budget by more than $256,000 last fiscal year. And they're set to go over budget this year.
 Jude Executive Jesse Perry claims, it's cheaper to send inmates elsewhere. But the jailer said, the math doesn't add up.
 Graves County Jailer George Workman said, he was alarmed after the Graves County Fiscal Court suggested closing the jail. Workman is concerned for his employees.
 "Our county doesn't have a lot of business coming in at this time," Workman said. "And we've been hurting in that area for a while. You know 40 jobs is pretty good chunk."
 If the jail closes down, Workman said they would become a transport office, transporting inmates to other detention centers. He claims that would cost more than the closure, to the tune of $300,000 a year.
 Workman also said inmates would lose out on correction programs that reduce their jail time, ultimately cutting housing costs.
 "That's just going to cause a bigger issue education wise," Workman said. "It's going to cause a bigger issue as far as space, inside the jails. And therefore causing fights and other problems."
 Workman said Graves County doesn't compare to other counties without a jail, like Hickman. He said the crime rate and population are higher. He's hoping the fiscal court reconsiders this proposal.
 Workman said he plans to speak with Judge Executive Jesse Perry this week about this. Perry wouldn't talk to us on camera today, he would only send a news release.

In an 11,000-word piece on the Dahlia in crimereads.com, author Miles Corwin relates how the department still receives a call a week or so about Elizabeth Short. She was a 22-year-old, part-time Long Beach resident and would-be actress who was found murdered in an L.A. vacant lot.
 She was given her nickname, which refers to her dark hair, by friends whom she'd meet with at a drugstore (now demolished) on Linden Avenue in Long Beach. She lived off and on at the Washington Hotel (now the restored Holly House Apartments), a few blocks away.
 Meanwhile, says LAPD Det. Mitzi Roberts, the calls keep coming in "from so- called witnesses or relatives and even confessed killers" as well as "nut jobs who claimed to have solved the case based on astrological numbers or pyramids."
 But no one on Earth has solved it.

The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) offers 12 weeks of job-protected leave. But it's unpaid, and it applies only if you work at a company with more than 50 employees. Many families, and especially single mothers, decline this offer. They need the income. Parental leave is linked to healthier babies; they have better long-term outcomes as they develop. An investment in parental leave would, in the long run, save money.

“With my daughter, she is a techie and excels in the sciences," she added. "She loves that we travel to a new destination a couple times a year in our attempt to see the world over their childhoods."
 Leading by example is a mantra — for parenthood and for life, she said.
 "What I tell the kids is how I try to live my life as well," Dobson said. "It is from a continuing education class I had when I first became a lawyer. The instructor told us why professions burn out, end up abusing substances or become alcoholics. She explained that many times we throw everything into one or two things, (career and family), and if either or both fall apart, the person’s life crumbles (unemployment, business fails, divorce).
 "She recommended, and this is my parenting style and how I live my life, look at your life like a pie divided upon among many things, as many slices as you can get in that pie so if one slice is taken away, your entire life does not fall apart," she added. "I take my kids with me when I can so they can see who I am, what I value and what my interests are."
 Life can't all be fun and games, Dobson said she tells her children — it takes work to create space for good times. It sometimes takes work to be kind too.
 "Also, (I bring them) so they can see how much work is necessary for us to live and enjoy things like our travels," she said. "Also, I told them my primary goal is to give them a childhood. We are adults for a long time, but the things you get to do when you are figuring yourself out from 0-18 is my responsibility.
 "It’s my job to create the space, and make sure everyone else does too, so they can be kids. Then, it is my hope that I am launching well-adjusted, confident, brave, citizens upon the world that will add to their community and not be a drain on it.”

Johnson & Johnson is beginning a huge final study to try to prove if a single- dose COVID-19 vaccine can protect against the virus.
 The study starting Wednesday will be one of the world’s largest coronavirus vaccine studies so far, testing the shot in 60,000 volunteers in the U.S., South Africa, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru.
 A handful of other vaccines in the U.S. — including shots made by Moderna Inc. and Pfizer Inc. — and others in other countries are already in final-stage testing. Hopes are high that answers about at least one candidate being tested in the U.S. could come by year’s end, maybe sooner.
 U.S. health officials insist the race for a vaccine isn’t cutting corners.
 “We want to do everything we can without sacrificing safety or efficacy — we’re not going to do that — to make sure that we end up with vaccines that are going to save lives,” Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, told reporters.
 But many vaccine specialists question whether the Food and Drug Administration will stick to that goal under intense pressure from the Trump administration. President Donald Trump has consistently presented a faster timeline for a new vaccine than experts say is adequate to fully test the candidates.
 Trump on Wednesday tweeted the link to a news report about the Johnson & Johnson study and said the FDA “must move quickly!”
 Meanwhile, testing of still another experimental vaccine, made by AstraZeneca, remains on hold in the U.S. as officials examine a safety question, even though studies have resumed in other countries.
 Earlier this week, Vice President Mike Pence urged state governors to “do your part to build public confidence that it will be a safe and effective vaccine.”
 And Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious disease expert, added in the call to governors that he is confident in “a tried and true process” that has checks and balances built in, including an independent board evaluating the progress of each vaccine trial, as well as “the integrity of the FDA.”
 A recording of the call was provided to The Associated Press.
 Senators were scheduled to question FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn, Fauci and other administration officials later Wednesday about the pandemic response.
 Even if the FDA were to allow emergency use of a vaccine by year’s end, supplies would be limited and given first to vulnerable groups such as health workers. Most Americans aren’t likely to receive a vaccine until sometime next year.
 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention wants states to get ready now to roll out vaccinations, which will present enormous logistical challenges. On Wednesday the CDC was set to announce distribution of $200 million in congressionally approved funds to help begin setting up operations.
 Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said the COVID-19 vaccine campaign will build on longstanding cooperation between the federal government and the states on immunizations.
 J&J’s vaccine is made with slightly different technology than others in late- stage testing, modeled on an Ebola vaccine the company created. Unlike the other three vaccines that started late-stage testing in the U.S., it requires only one shot, not two. Despite a later start to testing than some of its competitors, Dr. Paul Stoffels, J&J’s chief scientific officer, told reporters that the study was large enough to yield answers possibly by early next year.

"We just want to remind people that not only is there an election going on -- if that's escaped them, although I don't know they could not now that, but we also have a lot of down ticket races that are important as well," said Jason Crockett.
 For many voters it's not the person on the ballot, but the issues. The most recent issue is the vacant supreme court justice seat.
 "I know how hard she tried to stay through this next election cycle,' said Smith. "So in honor of Ruth. Do it for Ruthy get out there and vote."
 Crockett said he believes the upcoming confirmation of the next justice will mobilize the Republican base.
 "I think Ruth Bader Ginsburg was probably not always in line with Republican ways of thinking, we still respect her service to our country, but after that we move ahead to replacing her," said Crockett.
 No major campaigning strategies have changed on either side.
 Both parties believe the vacancy is just one more reason for voters on both sides of the aisle to vote.
 President Trump says he will name a supreme court nominee after the funeral of Justice Ginsburg.

Tuesday was the official beginning of fall, and with it has come with crisp fresh air and a new batch of seasonal produce.
   
 One of my favorite fall treats are apples.
   
 Fresh apples are such a treat and are delicious in both savory and sweet preparations.
   
 Where are they from?
   
 Apple trees are found across the globe, but have their roots in central Asia. The domestication of this fruit is thought to have occurred between 4,000 and 10,000 years ago "...in the Tian Shan Mountains, and then to have traveled along the Silk Road to Europe..."
   
 Cultivated for thousands of years in both Asia and Europe, they came across the pond with European settlers.
   
 This fruit has a variety of cultivars - around 7,500 known varieties - and each kind can be used in different preparations.
   
 Dessert apples are bred to be consumed fresh, and have a pleasant texture and sweet taste.
   
 Cooking and cider apples tend to be too tart to eat fresh, but that's not saying you can't.
   
 Old, unaltered apples tend to have odd and interesting shapes and lake the symmetry of commercially available produce.
   
 The etymology of apple, spelled aeppel in Old English, has Germanic roots that could mean fruit in general. In the 17th Century, the word continued to be used for all fruit except berries, but including nuts. Appel of paradis, for example, means banana.
   
 What to do
   
 Apples are synonymous with fall, especially with dessert.
   
 What is great about apples is you can use them in complex or simple preparations with equally delicious results.
   
 Apple pie is always delicious, but it can be labor intensive.
   
 What I do when I want all the flavor of apple pie, but with far less effort, is make baked apples.
   
 Baked apples have changed since they began gracing tables in the 1600s in England. This dish did not bake the apples whole, as is done today, but halved or quartered them before baking.
   
 A recipe printed in a 1915 New Jersey cookbook, describes the New England way to bake apples. It calls for quartered and peeled apples to be placed in a buttered quart-sized casserole dish and dusted with cinnamon. A cup of maple syrup is added, and the apples are baked until they are tender.
   
 The recipe recommends serving them hot with cream.
   
 "A Philadelphia touch to this dish is a sprinkling of walnuts over the apples," it continues.
   
 Baked whole apples are cored and filled with various toppings and seasonings. Popular choices include raisins and oats with spices like cinnamon and cloves.
   
 One variation is called a black cap, and calls for the apple to be cut in two crosswise before being filled with citrus peels or marmalade. The apple is then put back together and baked with wine or brandy and sugar. When they're place in a very hot oven, the top of the apple becomes black, hence the name.
   
 Another version bakes the fruit to dry them for longer storage. Commonly found in Norfolk, England, biffin apples "...are baked between a weight, to flatten it into a cake, and a layer of straw to absorb moisture..."
   
 The skin is removed prior to eating and it served with milk or cream.
   
 Baked sliced apples
   
 My favorite way to eat baked apples also involves the least amount of preparation. I peel and slice the apples, toss with butter, cinnamon and sugar and either saute them on the stove or bake them in casserole dish.
   
 I love these alone, but they are delicious on ice cream or yogurt. If you bake thinner slices, you can fold them in to pancake batter for apple pancakes.
   
 Baked sliced apples also make a great topping for oatmeal.
   
 The next time you have a craving for apple pie, try baking apples instead. I don't think you'll be disappointed.
   
 Sliced Baked Apples
   
 Ingredients
   
 • 5 - 6 large apples, peeled and sliced (Granny Smiths are my favorite - but use whatever you have)
   
 • Butter
   
 • 1 to 2 T brown sugar
   
 • 3 t. sugar
   
 • Vanilla extract to taste
   
 • 1 - 2 t. of cinnamon - or to taste
   
 • 3 1/2 T. water
   
 • You can add other spices - like nutmeg and clove - to taste
   
 Directions
   
 Preheat the oven to 350 and grease a baking dish with butter.
   
 Mix the sugar and spices together in a small bowl. Take around a third of the apples in a baking dish, then sprinkle with the spice mixture. Repeat these layers twice.
   
 Bake for 30 minutes; add the water and bake until the apples are your desired tenderness. I usually bake mine for 45 minutes total.
   
 Serve warm.
