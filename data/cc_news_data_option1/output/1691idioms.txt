RED SEA COAST, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News / WAM - 30th Apr, 2020) The UAE inaugurated, through its humanitarian arm, the Emirates Red Crescent, ERC, its annual charity project that aims to distribute 1,000 daily Iftar meals in the Al Wa'arah Camp in Khawkhah District, Hodeidah Governorate, during the Holy Month of Ramadan.
 The project will benefit 2,000 refugees and poor people on a daily basis in camps in the liberated districts of Yemen’s Red Sea Coast, in the governorates of Taiz and Hodeidah.
 Hazem Shandhour, Director of Relief Administration at the ERC in the Red Sea Coast, said that the ERC inaugurated the project by distributing 1,000 Iftar meals per day, adding that the number of meals during the Holy Month of Ramadan will total 65,000, and noting that relief teams are exerting significant efforts to reach beneficiaries.

The judgment stated, “As already noticed Article 164(4) in terms provides only a disqualification or a restriction for a Minister, who for any period of six consecutive months, is not a Member of the Legislature of the State to continue as such. It expressly provides that he shall on the expiration of that period cease to be a Minister unless he gets elected during that period by direct or indirect election. We must also bear in mind that no right is conferred on the concerned non-member Minister even during the period of `six months', when he is permitted to continue in office, to vote in the House. The privilege to vote in the House is concerned only on Members of the House of the Legislature of a State (Article 189). It does not extend to non-elected ministers. He may address the house but he cannot vote as an MLA. None of the powers or privileges of an MLA extend to that individual. Though under Article 177, the individual shall have a right to speak and to otherwise take part in the proceedings of the Legislative Assembly, he does not carry with him the usual free speech legislative immunity as provided by Article 194(2). The individual cannot draw any of the benefits of an MLA without getting elected. All these disabilities also clearly go to suggest that `six consecutive months' in Article 164(4) cannot be permitted to be repeatedly used for the same individual without his getting elected in the meanwhile.”

However, the deadline has passed for Seattle Promise, the program that gives Seattle Public Schools students graduating this spring two years of free community college at Seattle Colleges, regardless of family income. About 1,600 students met application deadlines, the first of which passed in February, before coronavirus was widespread.
 Seattle Colleges officials say they don’t know how, or if, the coronavirus will affect enrollment. In some national surveys, students have said they’re planning to downscale their education plans to save money — going to a state university rather than a pricier out-of-state or private college, for example, or starting at a community college.
 After the 2008 recession, Washington slashed funding for higher education to balance the budget, and many students who qualified for aid through a previous program, the State Need Grant, didn’t receive any state money. State financial aid is only one source of college money; more comes from federal Pell grants, and federal and private loans.

I love a good story.
 Who doesn't?
 Even the contrivances employed to make a good story work can be fun.
 I mean fiction in this case, not journalism.
 In journalism, acting on the precept, "Don't let the truth get in the way of a good story" can get you into serious trouble - or a job offer from FOX News.
 But in fictional stories, you can start off with a rousing line to get your reader's attention.
 Something like, "It was a dark and stormy night …"
 Now, who can resist reading further?
 And, of course, an unbelievably evil villain can be contrived, as well - Snidely Whiplashes, for instance, tying fair damsels to the train tracks.
 This is a villain so vile, so willing to promote his own self interest that he would affix the object of his affections to the local Amtrak line to demonstrate the sincerity of his devotion.
 People like that can't truly exist.
 And that contrived behavior, of course, gives the hero - Dudley Do-Right in this case - the opportunity to save the fair damsel in the nick of time.
 And there's always plenty of time to round up the bad guy before the end of the episode.
 Clever contrivances utilized to push a fictional story along can actually be implemented in journalism, as well.
 Though inventing villains would get you in trouble - or that aforementioned job with FOX.
 But there are many journalists - or writers attempting journalism - who employ novelistic techniques.
 An easy example would be "In Cold Blood" by Truman Capote, which he termed a non-fiction novel because of his use of novelistic techniques to tell the true story.
 Not that I'm saying Capote led the book off with, "It was a dark and stormy night …"
 I just like that opening.
 All of which brings us to a current story you might have some familiarity with, the pandemic.
 Is it possible that a true story can be so vast as to defy the use of techniques employed in fiction, that the scope is too great?
 Kurt Vonnegut once wrote something about the power of writing - where you can create all manner of cataclysmic scenarios with nothing but imagination and a page to fill.
 I tried to find the exact quote but couldn't. So I'll have to trust my memory.
 But the point was you didn't need all manner of special effects or whatever as you would to create a movie.
 And Vonnegut did write about such topics as the end of the world and mankind's evolution into a slightly dolphinesque species, among other things.
 So what happens when the story is of such an unbelievable scale that even clever contrivances from the fiction world are overwhelmed by the facts?
 Or, in other words, which applies,
 Art imitates life
 or
 Life imitates art?
 Aristotle held to the former while Oscar Wilde posited the latter.
 What would they have made of the pandemic affecting the entire planet and how to portray it appropriately?
 How the hell do I know?
 However, another classic contrivance in the world of fiction, old enough to have been corny in Aristotle's day, cannot come to the rescue of this story. And that's even though it's been used with less plausibility in thousands of cases to get a writer out of a difficult yarn:
 "It was all a dream …"

Concentrated animal feeding operations in Missouri, or CAFOs, are starting to feel the strain from COVID-19.


   


  With the closure of multiple meat processing facilities in Central Missouri and elsewhere due to outbreaks among workers, CAFOs are not able to send the volume of animals to processing facilities like they once were.


   


  As of Tuesday, there have been at least 4,400 reported positive cases tied to meatpacking facilities at 80 plants in 26 states, and at least 18 reported worker deaths at nine plants in nine states, according to tracking by USA TODAY and the Midwest Center for Investigative Reporting


   


  The greatest impact is on the pork industry, state Rep. Kent Haden, R-Mexico, said. This limitation is leading to CAFOs either to euthanize pigs on the nursery side, or hogs that are too large for processing facilities, he said.


   


  "It's catastrophic for the food supply and producers," Haden said. "This is one of the bigger nightmares we're going to have with [COVID-19]."


   


  Since CAFOs currently have an overabundance of animals, but fewer that are processed, it could lead to less meat available on grocery shelves and and increase in meat prices in the next few weeks.


   


  CAFOs are required to use buffer zones between hog facilities and public structures or residences. The Missouri Department of Natural Resources relaxed buffer rules beginning Friday and continuing through May 15 due to growing populations of animals at CAFOs.


   


  CAFOs not only have to keep these buffer zones, but depending on how they are classified can only keep so many animals at one time as well. Buffer zones range from 1,000 to 3,000 feet depending on the number of animals. The buffer zone rules suspension does not apply to manure discharges or other environmental rules from DNR, just how close hogs can be to public or residential structures.


   


  Processing plants are taking fewer hogs now, Haden said.


   


  "Instead of taking six loads of hogs, they are now taking maybe two," he said. "So, we are getting bigger pigs and we are getting backed up."


   


  This is leading to hog euthanasia at CAFOs, he added. Wisconsin is expecting to lose 200,000 hogs through euthanasia due to processing plant shutdowns.


   


  "The swine industry before COVID-19 was at 100% kill capacity," Haden said.


   


  This means about 500,000 hogs were killed per week, he said. After COVID-19, that kill capacity was reduced by 40%, according to Haden. This means only about 300,000 hogs are being killed on a weekly basis now in Missouri.


   


  "This could take an industry down," Haden said.


   


  The Missouri Pork Association sees the relaxing of rules as a positive, despite the reduction in product output.


   


  The rules suspension "will also help farmers most effectively deal with environmental and animal welfare issues during this unprecedented time in our nation's history," a statement read.


   


  While producers have emergency plans in place, the new coronavirus pandemic is unprecedented, Missouri Pork Association Director of Communications Diane Slater wrote in an email.


   


  "As events change, farmers are doing their best to take care of their pigs, people and the environment," she wrote.


   


  President Donald Trump on Tuesday called up the Defense Production Act to aid the U.S. pork industry. The act, first passed in 1950, seeks to protect "industrial efficiency and responsiveness." The move was celebrated by Missouri Pork Association Chairman Marcus Belshe.


   


  "Uniform, consistent solutions and all available resources are needed to address this crisis," he wrote in a statement. "We must stabilize the current plant capacity challenge and overcome other major hurdles facing the nation's pork production system."


   


  The relaxing of buffer zone rules is not seen as positive for all, however.


   


  The buffer zone rules already are inadequate so to suspend them is a bad move, Missouri Rural Crisis Center Rural Organizer Brian Smith said.


   


  "It can end up jeopardizing the environmental side of things, even though those rules haven't been relaxed," he said.


   


  Smith also hopes that DNR, despite relaxing buffer rules, will not accept any further CAFO applications for the time being.


   


  "This crisis has really demonstrated the rigidity and lack of resilience in that CAFO model of agriculture," Smith said. "Ultimately, DNR standards need to be strengthened and not weakened."


   


  Smith would prefer to see CAFOs develop environmental crisis plans so they can respond quicker to major events that affect their industry. The CAFOs shouldn't be blindsided, he said.


   


  "DNR needs to require that CAFOs have a crisis plan in place for these types of crises that can pop up," Smith said.

Senior England pacer Stuart Broad feels it will take time for cricket to resume even as there is talk of the game being held behind closed doors to counter the threat of COVID-19 pandemic. It s strange for players. It does still feel a long way away from getting back to playing cricket, Broad told the ‘BBC . The 33-year-old Test ace said he is confident that safety won t be compromised at any cost. One thing is for sure the sport won t take any risks. We will only be back playing live cricket when it has been deemed safe to do so by the government, Broad said. I think that would be behind closed doors and players and management staff would be in a close environment. There has been talks about playing in grounds with hotels built in them so you don t have to leave and move too far. Obviously we will be shining the ball and there will be contact quite naturally, he added. Broad added that players should continue with their own fitness and be ready for action whenever it comes. But we just have to make sure we are doing everything we can right now as players and dont delay playing due to fitness reasons once we are told to play, he said.

Only about 41% of the approximately 67,000 public and private school 12th graders in the state had filled out the paperwork by April 17, according to the National College Attainment Network (NCAN), which keeps tabs on financial- aid form completion. The top state: Tennessee, where nearly 75% of students had completed the FAFSA, the federal aid form. Washington ranks 44th.
 To be sure, completions of the federal aid form called FAFSA have dropped nearly 3 percentage points nationwide compared to the same time last year. "The news is grim any way you cut it," wrote Bill DeBaun, director of data and evaluation for NCAN, in a blog post.
 Washington has long been near the bottom on FAFSA completions. “We have a long way to go,” said Rachelle Sharpe, deputy executive director of the Washington Student Achievement Council, a state agency.
 Counselors and teachers are among those who help nudge students along to complete FAFSA forms. Of those who haven’t filled out the paperwork, “many of them will be students from low-income backgrounds, students of color, and/or first-generation students, and these students, even in a normal year, tend to need more support to hurdle the obstacles to get to college,” said DeBaun in an email.
 “It will take a concerted effort from a lot of partners in communities across the country to keep the class of 2020 on track for a postsecondary pathway,” he wrote.
 But it’s not too late to apply, Sharpe said. And although the FAFSA uses figures from a family’s 2018 tax return, students can talk to their college’s financial aid office and make adjustments if family income has fallen off — if a parent has lost a job, for example, she said.

By Sunday, she was struggling to breathe, and her fever had hit 101 degrees. Hansel and her husband rushed their daughter to the emergency room, where she spent hours undergoing tests.Twenty-four hours later, she was diagnosed with COVID-19.“I can’t lie and say that I didn’t go to the shower and cry my eyes out for a while," Charles Hansel said.“Our shower’s on the other end of the house from the bedroom, and I could hear him sobbing,” Amanda Hansel said. “Honestly the scariest thing is having to come to grips with the possibility that you might lose your child.”The Hansels also were unsure of where their daughter contracted the virus. She had not left their home nor interacted with anyone other than her parents.“How did that happen?" Charles Hansel asked himself. "You’ve tried everything. Then you start to feel like, ‘Was it my fault? Did I do something? Did I do something wrong?'”For days after the diagnosis, Amanda stayed up through the night, holding Leia and monitoring her breathing while she slept.About 10 days later, Leia turned the corner.“It was night and day," Charles Hansel said. "She just went from being, ‘I don’t want to do nothing. I just want to lay here and try to sleep’ to, ‘OK, now we’re ready to go.’”With the coronavirus past them, the Hansels wanted one more way to mark their daughter’s recovery. They threw Leia her first-ever Easter egg hunt, capturing the event on video and sending it to family and friends.“It just kind of turned into a little celebration for us," Amanda Hansel said.

One particular fruit that has been overbought is the tomato, which in this heat, ripens and softens quickly. “Tomatoes have a lot of versatility,” comments Karishma, “When they are soft and look slightly bruised, you can make a puree or a gravy, or whip up a large batch of base pasta sauce. Oven- roasting tomatoes brings out a lot of sweetness, and doesn’t require a lot of hands-on time as the oven does the workload. Once roasted, you can blend them into a soup with a smoky touch.”
 Alternatively, excess tomatoes can be converted into a tasty tomato chutney, to be eaten with hot white rice and a dash of ghee, creating a whole new meal in itself. These home-made chutneys are the go-to options for those not wanting to part with still-usable produce, such as ridge gourd, onions and yellow cucumber.

Bloomberg) -- Europe is circling the wagons.
 Thrust into a new era of big government by the coronavirus pandemic, European Union officials are scrambling to protect their most prized assets after the worst stock-market rout in nearly a decade left them vulnerable to takeovers.
 Berlin, Paris, Rome and Madrid have all increased their powers to veto investment from outside the EU in recent weeks and the bloc is ushering in the first continent-wide rules for screening takeovers on security grounds. Special safeguards have been offered to biotech firms as the race for a vaccine against Covid-19 takes on critical importance.
 In a world where economic collapse has added to the uncertainties stirred up by China's rise, America's retreat and Russia's muscle-flexing, the 27-nation EU is ditching its longstanding open-door policy amid signs that other global powers are looking to gain an advantage.
 Chinese companies backed by the financial muscle of the communist state are already hunting for bargains in Europe. In 2018, Germany only learned belatedly about billionaire private investor Li Shufu's stealth operation to become Daimler AG's biggest shareholder. Officials in Berlin were also alarmed by reports in March of a U.S. government approach, denied by the White House, for a vaccine research firm.
 "This is about the need to protect our critical infrastructure -- to be not too naive about what could happen with some vulnerable sectors and vulnerable technologies from third-country interventions," European Trade Commissioner Phil Hogan told EU lawmakers on April 21 in Brussels.
 Until now, foreign investors have been mostly concerned with complying by the EU's competition rules, said Pascal Dupeyrat, who advises non-European investors in France. "For the next five to 10 years, such transactions will have to be acceptable under the much broader measure of national security," he said.
 Still, what Europeans might call predatory behavior, others would consider fair game under the rules of modern capitalism. If anything, critics argue it underscores the creeping protectionism that has dogged Europe in the past years.
 The EU must also tread carefully because of the importance of foreign direct investment, or FDI, to the European economy. FDI is directly responsible for around 16 million jobs in the EU and the bloc had attracted 7.2 trillion euros ($7.8 trillion) of foreign money by the end of 2018.
 In that sense, Europe has been a barometer of the global economy. Worldwide, the ratio of FDI stocks to global gross domestic product increased almost sixfold to 40% in 2017 from 7% in 1990, according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.
 Despite the extra regulatory scrutiny, foreign investors' interest in European assets will remain strong as a result of the equity-market slump likely to last well into next year, said Davina Garrod, a London-based investment and competition adviser at law firm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP.
 "The tide is turning in Europe with heightened vigilance, particularly regarding the Chinese and Russians," Garrod said. "But it's not turning Europe into a fortress."
 In Germany, warnings about possible bids by foreign suitors have put the spotlight on industries ranging from machinery to software.
 In early April , Chancellor Angela Merkel's government tightened protections to enable it to block acquisitions that present "potential interference" to critical infrastructure. On Tuesday the economy minister added an extra provision for all investments of 10% or more in healthcare companies. France and Italy have introduced similar rules for all strategic businesses this month and broadened the definition of key firms to include healthcare.
 And then there is the U.K., which left the EU and has seemed intent on showing it will do things differently. But the mood in London has cooled toward China and the post-Brexit dream of a "Global Britain" is likely to come under pressure as the government sees famous brands being swiped up.
 Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing recently bought pub operator Greene King and Mukesh Ambani, Asia's richest man, acquired the iconic toy-store chain Hamleys last year. Over the past three months, executives from mainland China, Hong Kong and Singapore -- including Li Ka-shing's son Victor Li and Chinese billionaire Guo Guangchang -- have said they are looking to pick up assets pummeled by the virus.
 Blocking Takeovers
 In Berlin, officials are on their guard.
 Following reports of a U.S. offer to German biotech firm Curevac, Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said authorities were scrutinizing one concrete attempt to purchase a German company involved in "medical production" and examining several others.
 "There are a number of other cases that we are monitoring very closely, in which we're determined to stop potential takeovers," he said.
 Analysts suggest that the small- and medium-sized engineering firms that form the backbone of German industry could attract interest. They've highlighted companies like Jenoptik AG in the former communist east that specializes in precision lasers and optics and Deutz AG, the world's oldest engine company, which is now developing electric drivetrains.
 Shifting Mood
 With memories still fresh of Chinese investments in the likes of Greece's main seaport and of Portugal's biggest utility during the euro-area debt crisis, Germans were alarmed by the takeover of robot maker Kuka AG by China's Midea Group Co. in 2016.
 A joint push in early 2017 by Germany, France and Italy led the EU as a whole to bolster its defenses and in 2018 the German government stopped a Chinese bid for the first time, vetoing the potential purchase of machine-tool manufacturer Leifeld Metal Spinning AG.
 A new European law on screening foreign investments, due to take effect this October, aims to increase protection for "critical infrastructure," including in the health, energy, transport and financial industries, and "critical technologies" such as artificial intelligence, robotics and semiconductors. That legislation was driven largely by unease over Chinese acquisitions.
 Without taking the ultimate power of approving deals away from individual EU governments, the law sets up a bloc-wide "cooperation mechanism" for foreign direct investments. While waiting for the legislation to take full effect on Oct. 11, the European Commission is warning against complacency.
 "The mood has shifted significantly in Europe," said Joachim Pohl, an expert on foreign direct investment at the Paris-based OECD. "Security concerns have come to the fore."

The judgment stated, “As already noticed Article 164(4) in terms provides only a disqualification or a restriction for a Minister, who for any period of six consecutive months, is not a Member of the Legislature of the State to continue as such. It expressly provides that he shall on the expiration of that period cease to be a Minister unless he gets elected during that period by direct or indirect election. We must also bear in mind that no right is conferred on the concerned non-member Minister even during the period of `six months', when he is permitted to continue in office, to vote in the House. The privilege to vote in the House is concerned only on Members of the House of the Legislature of a State (Article 189). It does not extend to non-elected ministers. He may address the house but he cannot vote as an MLA. None of the powers or privileges of an MLA extend to that individual. Though under Article 177, the individual shall have a right to speak and to otherwise take part in the proceedings of the Legislative Assembly, he does not carry with him the usual "free speech" legislative immunity as provided by Article 194(2). The individual cannot draw any of the benefits of an MLA without getting elected. All these disabilities also clearly go to suggest that `six consecutive months' in Article 164(4) cannot be permitted to be repeatedly used for the same individual without his getting elected in the meanwhile.”

The US renewed its unilateral sanctions on Iran and avoided partaking in the JCPOA Joint Commissions, which sealed the withdrawal. So, the US cannot use the articles 11, 12 of UNSC Resolution 2231 to claim Iran has violated the deal.

The Scottish Rugby Union (SRU) have moved quickly to distance themselves from comments made by Glasgow Warriors head coach Dave Rennie, who suggested that the PRO14 season should be scrapped and Leinster awarded the title. The SRU's performance director Jim Mallinder has clarified the union's position, and insisted that they do not believe Leinster should be crowned champions.Edinburgh are flying high at the top of Conference B, two points ahead of Munster, and while Mallinder acknowledged Leinster's impressive unbeaten form this season, he was reluctant to go along with Rennie's assessment of the situation.PRO14 organisers have remained tight-lipped throughout the Covid-19 pandemic and this morning's confirmation that the TOP 14 has been cancelled in favour of hopefully starting a fresh campaign in September will not have gone unnoticed.&quot;From an SRU point of view we wouldn't agree with that and I guess that PRO14 would probably have something to say, and I guess Richard Cockerill (Edinburgh head coach) would have something to say about it as well,&quot; Mallinder said with regard to Rennie's comments.&quot;I don't think we've played enough matches to give the title to Leinster. Clearly they've had an outstanding start, and it's been brilliant for them to go unbeaten, but there are some other sides who are playing well.&quot;What we've said at the moment is that there's the season, then the play-offs, then the final, and that it's the winner of that who should get it. That's why I don't agree that Leinster should be given it.&quot;Mallinder revealed that the PRO14 will meet next week to discuss contingency plans, as the SRU continue to adhere to the guidelines set out.&quot;We have to make sure that whatever we have in terms of season structure is right for the businesses and the players, but it's a very difficult one,&quot; the former Northampton boss added.&quot;We know there is probably not going to be any rugby at least before June and we know then at the right time there will be a phased return to rugby in terms of individual training.&quot;We are already now looking at individual, then coming into training facilities to build that up to smaller groups, and getting full contact.&quot;We're looking at this from small groups all the way through to playing a game, initially behind closed doors, and then, ultimately – which we know will be quite a time away – coming back to playing, hopefully, in front of full stadiums.&quot;It is a difficult one and we know that in terms of the PRO14 next week they've got a review in terms of the scenario planning, with lots of scenarios to put in place.&quot;They are taking advice from all the unions, and the medical side, so we're still very open-minded PRO14 wise about restarting or restructuring, whatever that might be, but at the moment no decision has been taken as yet.&quot;

African Americans are struggling with a disproportionate death toll from COVID-19 and severe financial strain from the economic downturn. This crisis has exposed preexisting racial disparities created by deep-seated social, economic and political factors.
 These same underlying issues make African Americans more vulnerable to health damage from pollution, as well as from heat waves, storms and other effects of climate change.
 Meanwhile, African Americans are missing out on wealth creation opportunities in the clean energy economy, which could be an effective solution to some of these underlying issues -- bringing jobs and environmental benefits to communities that need it the most.
 In this episode of _Political Climate_, the fifth in our "Path to Zero" series with Third Way, we look at how COVID-19 and climate change are affecting Black communities, and how these issues can be tackled in tandem.
