HONOLULU (AP) — The Honolulu City Council has introduced two bills that would increase fares for public transportation. Bill 89, introduced Thursday, would set up a fare structure for the city bus and the rail system and increases fares almost across the board. Bill 87 was introduced the same day and would increase fares for the city's paratransit services. Both bills were introduced by City Council Chairwoman Ann Kobayashi after the Honolulu Rate Commission finished its deliberations for fare schedules. The commission sent its recommendation for a fare increase for paratransit services to Mayor Kirk Caldwell, Kobayashi and the Department of Transportation Services on Oct. 21, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported. Bill 89 would take effect in July 2021 and would increase adult single rides to $3, monthly passes to $80 and annual passes to $880. Currently for adults, single rides are $2.50, monthly passes are $70 and annual passes are $770. Prices for those ages 6 to 17 and high school students who are 18- or 19-years-old would increase to $1.50 per single ride, $40 monthly and $440 annually. Current prices for those demographics are $1.25 for a single ride, $35 for a monthly pass and $385 for an annual pass. Children 5-years-old and younger would continue to have free fares. All the new rates fall in line with the commission's recommendations. Bill 87 also jibes with the Rate Commission's recommendations, this one to increase the fare for a one-way Handi-Van trip to $2.25 up from $2. The fare has not increased since 2001. That bill would be implemented in March 2021 but the date could be extended, Kobayashi said. Hearings on the bills could be scheduled in a few weeks, Kobayashi said.

I love to ride bicycles, but I haven’t yet joined the growing number of folks who are riding electronic bikes.
 E-bikes, for those who might not be familiar, are bicycles propelled by electric motors. Despite my rather advanced age, I still enjoy the physical challenge of riding a bike propelled solely by leg power — but different strokes for different folks.
 I hadn’t even seen an e-bike in action until a couple of weeks ago, when I was out on a ride through the streets near my home.
 I had just leveled off after huffing and puffing up a hill when, off in the distance, I noticed a fellow riding what appeared to be a mountain bike. He was short and quite heavy-set, and yet he appeared to be moving pretty quickly.
 What struck me was how slowly he turned the pedals. I’ve ridden enough bikes to know that, to make a bike with fat tires and low gearing move that quickly, you have to pedal really, really fast.
 The guy turned off onto a side street before I reached him, so I put any curiosity out of my mind and kept on going.
 About a half hour later, as I headed home, I saw him again. I was pushing along at about 17 miles an hour — a pretty good clip for me, especially on a slight upslope — and this chap came breezing past me, still barely turning his pedals.
 “OK, that’s got to be an e-bike,” I thought.

Nonetheless, despite the lack of clear numbers on reservation cases from the state or federal government, the enhanced contact tracing and home visits appear to have lowered the death rate on the White Mountain Apache Reservation. This held true even though four-fifths of people who were infected also infected other household members, in a community with many multi-generational families.
 The tribe’s roughly 1% death rate compares to a statewide death rate of about 2.5% and a national death rate of 2.7%. Bear in mind, that’s doesn’t reflect the death rate for all of those infected — just for those who have a positive test. Doctors suspect that 30 or 40% of those infected never develop serious symptoms and never get tested.
 “Crowded home environments are a part of life in our community,” wrote the two doctors in the New England Journal of Medicine. “It’s not uncommon for eight or more people to live in a two-bedroom house, so self-isolation is nearly impossible. Several families in our community set up camping tents in their yards to quarantine infected household members, but the sharing of bathrooms and eating utensils contributed to secondary household attack rates above 80%. Nearly every household here includes a grandparent, and many include a great- grandparent. It’s rare to encounter a patient with COVID-19 who doesn’t live with at least one high-risk person.
 “Identifying high-risk patients who would benefit from early intervention became our top priority. Our tracing team went from asking, ‘Where have you been?’ to asking, ‘Who are your grandparents?’ We perform rapid testing of newly identified contacts, and a team of clinicians visits people who have tested positive as often as every day. Public health nurses call high-risk people who have been exposed to COVID but tested negative to verify that they are remaining asymptomatic throughout the incubation period,” according to the summary in the medical journal.
 The large number of people who were infected but had no symptoms made the contact tracing critical. The doctors said the contact tracers frequently found people who tested positive, but had no idea they were sick.
 “This type of intensive outreach effort is important for two reasons,” the doctors wrote. “First, several people in our community have had cases of ‘happy hypoxemia,’ with little awareness that they had a serious respiratory disease. Waiting for patients to seek care only when symptoms become intolerable reduces the utility of most interventions. By detecting hypoxemia sooner, we can start patients on oxygen and, in some cases, keep them at home. The second reason has been the unexpected utility of frequent follow-up visits made by our team members that make them more available to the community. Many patients with the ‘happiest’ hypoxemia — those with minimal or no dyspnea — are young, relatively healthy people who might not otherwise present for medical care at all. We try to evaluate everyone in the household when we are visiting elders, and we frequently discover people with oxygen saturations of 80% or lower who did not know they were infected. Only by being in the field are we able to identify such patients early, initiate supportive care, and perhaps save a few lives.”
 Despite those efforts, the virus has continued to surge back and forth across the reservation -with a recent rise in cases.

Police stepped in Saturday to shield health workers gathered in Bern to demand better working conditions, after protesters against fresh virus restrictions tried to disrupt their demonstration.
 Around 1,000 health care professionals gathered in the Swiss capital Saturday afternoon to cap off a week of protests across the country demanding better pay and other conditions amid the pandemic.
 But their authorised and peaceful protest was briefly disrupted by around 100 people taking part in an unauthorised protest against restrictions aimed at controlling the spread of Covid-19, which were tightened this week as virus cases surged in the country.
 Police in riot gear coralled the anti-restriction demonstrators behind barriers to give space to the health workers, who needed to spread out on the square in front of the parliament building to maintain the recommended physical distance.

BERLIN (AP) — Eight-time defending champion Bayern Munich held on to beat Cologne 2-1 in the Bundesliga on Saturday.
 First-half goals from Thomas Müller and Serge Gnabry were enough for Bayern to move top on goal difference from Borussia Dortmund, which beat Arminia Bielefeld 2-0.
 Leipzig can reclaim the lead if it beats Borussia Mönchengladbach in the late game.
 Bayern coach Hansi Flick opted to give star striker Robert Lewandowski a rest before Tuesday’s visit to Salzburg in the Champions League. Lewandowski had scored 10 goals in five Bundesliga games, setting a hard pace for replacement Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting to follow.
 A penalty provided the breakthrough for Bayern in the 13th minute. Gnabry’s header was inadvertently blocked by Marius Wolf’s arm and referee Frank Willenborg pointed to the spot. Müller duly converted the penalty.
 Joshua Kimmich made the difference before the break when he won the ball with a perfectly timed challenge in midfield and set off Gnabry down the right. Gnabry cut inside to score his fourth goal of the season.

North Carolina’s legislative elections are particularly important because the governor cannot veto maps drawn by the House and Senate. Some candidates there are running in a different district for the third time in as many elections, after courts repeatedly tossed out maps passed by the GOP-led Legislature.
 Some North Carolina Democrats are running on a pledge to support the creation of an independent redistricting commission.
 “Extreme partisan gerrymandering and repeated efforts to restrict voting rights have prevented North Carolinians from holding their representatives accountable, and that’s just unacceptable,” said Democrat Terri LeGrand, who is challenging Republican state Sen. Joyce Krawiec in a district that includes part of the Winston-Salem area.
 Krawiec said she doubts it's possible to assemble a truly nonpartisan redistricting commission and doubts Democrats would follow through with it if they won legislative power. For more than a century until 2011, Democrats drew North Carolina districts that "were extremely gerrymandered, and they’re much better now,” Krawiec said.
 A lot also is at stake in Texas, which is second only to California in congressional representation and is likely to gain even more U.S. House seats when the census measures its rapid population growth. Republicans currently hold every statewide office, both chambers of the Texas Legislature and nearly two-thirds of its congressional delegation.
 But Democrats need to flip just nine seats to take control of the state House for the first time since 2002. Doing so would give them a blockade against Republican measures on abortion, immigration and voting rights that have roiled the Texas Capitol for years. It also would give Democrats a say in the redistricting process.
 The Democratic targets include nine Republican-held districts in the Dallas, Houston and San Antonio areas that Democrat Beto O'Rourke carried in his narrow U.S. Senate loss in 2018. This year, O'Rourke is helping coordinate hundreds of thousands of phone calls in those districts urging voters to support the Democratic candidates.
 One of those districts, on Houston’s west side, reflects the GOP’s slipping grip on the suburbs nationally.
 The retiring incumbent, Republican Dwayne Bohac, drew national attention in 2013 for a bill that he said protected public school teachers to say “Merry Christmas” on campus. He won reelection the next year by a 3-to-1 margin.
 But in his last election in 2018, Bohac prevailed by a mere one-tenth of percentage point in a race that helped the GOP withstand a Democratic wave.
 This year, Democrat Akilah Bacy had raised more than twice as much money as Republican Lacey Hull heading into the final month of campaigning for the open seat. Though it's a big deal to the party, Bacy said she knows redistricting power is not a top-of-mind issue for most voters in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic and a shaken economy.
 “If we flip the Texas House, redistricting is coming up! And people are like, ’What are you talking about?'” Bacy said. “I just try to talk about the issues that matter most. The basic, kitchen-table issues.”
 Chambers, the head of the Republicans' state elections organization, said he thinks the GOP can hold onto the Texas House, “but it’s going to be a fight all the way until the end.”
 Democrats “would need to have a perfect night” to flip the Texas House, said Jessica Post, president of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee.
 The challenge, she said, is that “we’re running on Republican-drawn maps that were designed to sustain high-water marks of Democratic performance."

As Bengaluru continues to report the highest number of cases among all the districts in Karnataka, and amidst warnings of a second wave of the pandemic ahead of Deepavali, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has cracked the whip on hospitals that allegedly failed to reserve the mandated number of beds for government-sponsored COVID-19 patients. Some of them have also been accused of overcharging or denying beds to patients.
 Seven hospitals are in the dock for allegedly not complying with the direction of the civic body to reserve beds for BBMP-sponsored COVID-19 patients, and the civic body has decided to take “exemplary action” against them.
 According to a statement from BBMP Commissioner N. Manjunath Prasad on Saturday: “Showcause notices have been issued to the seven hospitals under the KPME (Karnataka Private Medical Establishments) Act for suspension of licence. These hospitals have been directed to show cause within the next 24 hours as to why the KPME registration should not be cancelled. If no proper explanation is received within 24 hours along with compliance, the BBMP will be constrained to close down the OPDs (Out Patient Department) at the first instance, and thereafter all the existing patients admitted in these hospitals will be shifted to some other hospitals, and subsequently these hospitals will be closed down.”
 Meanwhile, Karnataka is lagging behind in the process of creating a database of healthcare workers, who would be the first beneficiaries of the COVID-19 vaccine when it hits the market. As of now, only a little over 30% of the total 28,753 healthcare facilities in the State have submitted details. The Centre had asked States to submit the database by October 31.
 While 89% of government healthcare facilities have submitted details, the response from private facilities has been very poor with not more than 23% filling up the standard database templates. Following this, the State is now planning to request the Centre to extend the deadline by a few more days.

French forces intervened in recent years against Islamic extremists in Mali and Syria, both former French holdings. Thousands of French soldiers are now stationed in former colonies in the Sahel region of Africa with the same mission.
 A French military presence fuels routine online appeals from IS, Al-Qaida and other extremists for retaliation on French soil, in hopes of forcing France to withdraw its forces.
 STRICT SECULARISM
 Much of the current anger stems from the recent republication by French satirical newspaper weekly Charlie Hebdo of caricatures depicting the Prophet Muhammad. The cartoon images of Islam's founder deeply offended many Muslims, who see them as sacrilegious. But the cartoons were originally published in Denmark in 2005, and similar images have been published in other countries that hold freedom of expression dear.
 While French officials often say their country is targeted because of its reputation as the cradle of human rights and a rampart of global democracy, what distinguishes France most is its unusual attachment to secularism.
 The often-misunderstood concept of French secularism is inscribed in the country's constitution. It was born in a 1905 law separating church and state that was meant to allow the peaceful coexistence of all religions under a neutral state, instead of a government answering to powerful Roman Catholic clerics. Crucifixes were at one point torn from classroom walls in France amid painful public debate.
 A century later, polls suggest France is among the least-religious countries in the world, with a minority attending services regularly. Secularism is broadly supported by those on both left and right.
 As the number of Muslim in France grew, the state imposed secular rules on their practices. A 2004 banning Muslim headscarves and other ostentatious religious symbols in schools remains divisive, if not shocking to many outside France. A 2011 law banning face veils made Muslims feel stigmatized anew.
 OUTSPOKEN PRESIDENT
 France has been hit with extremist attacks over recent decades under leaders across the political spectrum, but centrist President Emmanuel Macron is a particularly popular target. Protesters burned his portrait or stomped on it at protests in multiple countries this week.
 That's in part because of a law Macron plans to introduce to crack down on Islamist fundamentalists he contends are turning some communities against the state and threatening pillars of French society, including schools. In the wake of recent extremist attacks, his government expelled Muslims accused of preaching intolerance and shut down groups seen as undermining French laws or norms.
 The words the president uses have provoked outrage as well. He said the planned law was aimed at Islamist "separatism," which raised fears of the further alienation of French Muslims.
 At a memorial for a teacher beheaded for showing the prophet caricatures to his class, Macron gave a speech extolling tolerance, knowledge and religious freedom. But he drew ire, including from Turkey's president, for saying, "We won't renounce the caricatures" and that France should "diminish Islamists."
 Earlier, Macron described Islam as a "a religion that is in crisis all over the world," with positions "hardening" in many Muslim countries.
 And as calls for anti-French protests mounted, he tweeted: "We will not give in, ever."

The reservation has reported more than 2,600 cases and 41 deaths. The 1% death rate among confirmed cases is lower than the statewide average, despite the large percentage of the population with pre-existing conditions, like diabetes. The doctors writing in the New England Journal of Medicine credited the effort to support and monitor people in their homes with the low death rate.
 Some 110 cases are pending awaiting the test results — with about 8 new confirmed cases daily, according to a summary posted on Oct. 26. Doctors have administered 13,291 tests, much higher in relationship to the population than elsewhere in the state.
 However, the resurgence in cases on the reservation and elsewhere continues to pose a challenge.
 The Hon-Dah Resort-Casino was once again closed when several employees tested positive. The casino closed on Oct. 19 and was expected to remain closed for two weeks.
 “While only two employees have tested positive for COVID-19, every employee who was in contact with those positive employees must self-quarantine, regardless of their test results. This has stretched Casino staffing levels,” according to the notice of the closure posted on the website.
 “We are acting swiftly to protect the health, safety and welfare of our employees and customers. At Hon-Dah, we put our people and our community’s needs first,” said General Manager Brent Kurth.
 The White Mountains Apache Tribe Emergency Operations Center recently posted a notice on its Facebook page saying the Tribe will continue to monitor the rise in cases in the event an additional lockdown becomes necessary.
 “We appreciate all the calls asking for a lockdown in light of recent COVID-19 increases. We are definitely alarmed at the increases in our active cases on the reservation. As such we have been working with our partners to finalize amendments to our current alert system and will post the document for public comment before it heads to the council for final approval,” Kurth said.
 It is important that we remain vigilant as a community during this COVID-19 global pandemic as international and national trends seem to indicate a second wave of this virus. As the fall season arrives to our community we implore all residents to continue adhering to all local COVID-19 guidelines such as wearing your face mask, even when you leave the reservation, practicing social distancing, washing your hands or using a safe hand sanitizer, avoiding large crowds, and limiting who you allow into your homes, among others.
 “We are the solution and must all do our part for the sake of our elders, children, and every community member. Every loss of life is a tragedy and we have lost so many great people in our community already. All of our lives have been interrupted so please we ask you to do your part,” stated the notice.
 Advocates for tribes say the lack of consistent data, the long delay in releasing Congressionally approved funding and the decades-long accumulation of unmet health needs on the reservations have made the pandemic far more lethal for Native Americans.
 “If you eliminate us in the data, we no longer exist,” said Abigail Echo-Hawk, director of the Urban Health Institute, in an article in the journal Science.
 For instance, many of the data intake forms used by the federal government don’t provide a category for Native American, but lump many into the category of “other.”
 Native Americans have been 3.5 times more likely to be diagnosed with COVID-19 as non-Hispanic whites, according to one recent summary of the existing data released by the federal Centers for Disease Control.
 “American Indian and Alaska Native people have suffered a disproportionate burden of COVID-19 illness during the pandemic,” said CDC Director Dr. Robert R. Redfield. “This funding approach will broaden access to COVID-19 resources across tribal communities.”
 The CDC notice published in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report noted that only “limited data” was available to determine why COVID-19 has hit reservation communities so hard. However “persisting racial inequity and historical trauma have contributed to disparities in health and socioeconomic factors …The elevated incidence within this population might also reflect differences in reliance on shared transportation, limited access to running water, household size and other factors that might facilitate community transmission.”

In light of what He was about to teach them concerning his own death and resurrection and their own willingness to deny themselves and take up their crosses and follow him, Jesus now assured the 12, and all believers who would ever come to Him, that the gates of Hades, the chains of death itself, could never permanently overpower them and hold them captive
 Peter was not the rock, but he did have an important role to play. Specifically, he (and all believers in the church) were given “the keys of the kingdom of heaven” with the added promise, “whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven” (v.19). Does that mean Peter was given the exclusive and daunting privilege of determining who would go to heaven and who would not?
 Peter used the keys (the authority of the church) by opening the door of the gospel to Jews by his preaching at Pentecost, recorded in Acts 2, and by opening the door of the gospel to gentiles by his preaching in the house of Cornelius, recorded in Acts 10. Peter was the apostle to the Jews, so he preached to the Jews first. But although he was the apostle to the Jews, Peter was also the first to bring the gospel to a strictly gentile audience.
 Jesus is the Christ, the son of the living God. He is the sinner’s savior. Therefore, to repent of sin and believe in him is to pass from death to life and to find salvation. To reject him is to perish forever. This is good news. Believe it, and tell others too.

“Certainly in Philadelphia, we’re making a lot of headlines, which is really good as the game continues to grow,” Curtin said.
 The Union’s push for the championship has blossomed under Durant’s watch in his first year since he purchased a 5% ownership stake in the franchise. Sugarman has said the Union is worth more than $325 million, putting Durant’s stake at $16.25 million, at minimum. The two-time NBA champion has yet to join the Sons of Ben at Subaru Park, but he’s sent autographed Brooklyn Nets jerseys to the team and donated items for auction as part of the Union’s COVID-19 relief fund drive. Durant even jumped on a Zoom call with the Union to break up the monotonous days in the MLS bubble.

OK, we’ve tried putting an amateur in charge. It was an experiment; it didn’t work. Time to try something else.
 It is an appealing concept. We look at government; it doesn’t work. We think that the problem must be a bunch of career politicians, people who are out of touch with the real people. If we just had a fresh face, someone who had never been in politics before. That person could step in, apply some good old fashioned common sense, and things would get better.
 Donald Trump was the extreme example of the rank amateur. He had been in real estate and on TV. He had never been elected to anything.
 This is contrary to anything that any of us would do in our private lives. Would we make someone who has never even seen a Slushie machine in operation the manager of a Go-Mart? Would the Yankees hire a manager who had never played the game or never managed a minor league team? With the exception of the most low level jobs, would we ever hire anyone to do anything if that person had no experience on his or her resume?
 Yet we did it. We turned over the top job to a rank amateur.
 The closest we have come to such a decision in the last century was President Eisenhower. He had never held public office. He had, however, been a four-star general, Supreme Allied Commander in World War II and had experience at the top of a huge bureaucracy. The last businessman we had was Herbert Hoover, who came to public service as a multimillionaire from a career in engineering and mining.
 When Donald Trump was elected I had hope. I hoped that he would give up his campaign habits of calling people names, relentlessly attacking and claiming that he was the only one who could fix our problems. Political campaigns are a kind of combat. Maybe when he got in office the combat would be over. He would calm down, quit attacking people and be president of all the people.
 He didn’t. The Trump of the campaign simply became the Trump of the presidency. He continued attacking people. He demanded total loyalty. He would never give anybody credit for anything. He never even pretended that he was the president of anyone other than those who voted for him.
 Now it is four years later and look where we are. Nothing is better.
 Of course, the pandemic is not all his fault. He just made it worse than it had to be.

In an initial press release on the day of the incident, Navajo County Sheriff’s Office Public Information Officer Tori Gorman said that the alleged double shooting happened at approximately 10:16 a.m. at a residence in Sun Valley (just outside Holbrook) and that 911 operators started getting calls about shots fired around that time.
 “A Navajo County Sheriff’s Auxiliary Volunteer was on routine patrol, headed towards the Sun Valley area, when the SAV saw a vehicle matching the description given for the suspect (Toney). The SAV advised the Holbrook Police Department, who initiated a traffic stop and apprehended (Toney) south of Holbrook on State Route 77,” Gorman stated in the press release.
 “On behalf of the Sheriff’s Office I would like to offer our sincere condolences to the family who lost so much today. Domestic violence situations have always been some of the most critical calls we respond to and today was such an incident that will affect many lives. I also would like to thank my deputies and other L.E. agencies who responded so quickly to render aid and investigate this crime. A big recognition to our SAV who was vigilant in his patrols today and located the suspect within minutes of the first 911 call. This is an example of local agencies who work closely with one another and having a dispatch center tying it all together,” NCSO Sheriff David Clouse stated in the press release.
 Officer Toney started with the NCSO in 1997 as a temporary detention officer and transitioned to full time in June 2001, stated Gorman.
 The family is accepting donations in light of the fact that a mother and wife is dead and funeral expenses loom.
 The now-sole bread winner is incapacitated and may be for some time.

His first mistake was not taking it seriously. He keeps saying that China could have stopped it. Presumably he means that there was a time when there were just a few cases in China and that, had China acted promptly and effectively, the virus could have been contained. At the same time, there was a time when there were just a few cases in the United States. Couldn’t he have acted promptly and effectively to contain it?
 By July, President Trump had switched from ignoring the pandemic and hoping it would go away to being a “war time” president, charging forth to battle this unseen enemy. He said he was working on a “very strong plan” for getting the virus under control. Good. Now we are going to get somewhere. The time to develop the plan was in January, not July, but wisdom so often never comes that we should not reject it because it comes late. A plan in July is better than no plan, ever. Maybe Mr. Common Sense, Get-things-done Businessman would kick into gear and lead us forward.
 What we got is no plan, ever. Here it is three months later and we are still limping along, no plan, no end in sight.
 He was elected as a businessman — a bottom-line, can-do guy who can get things done. What he has gotten done is ,more than 230,000 deaths and counting. We have one of the highest death rates in the world, over twice that of Canada. We can quibble with whether this or that decision was the right one and whether he should have done this or that. For a businessman such as Mr. Trump, the bottom line is that we have over twice the deaths per capita as that of the country in the world that is most similar to us. It is not a comparison to some country with better technology than ours. It is not a comparison to some dirt poor country with no resources and little technology. A comparison to the country that is most similar tells us that, had we handled the virus as effectively as the Canadians, well over 100,000 Americans would still be alive. That’s where our bottom line, can-do businessman president has brought us.
 No one can say how a more experienced president would have reacted. Maybe someone with some government experience would have recognized the pandemic earlier for what it was. Maybe a more experienced president would have known better how to mobilize the resources of the federal government to fight the pandemic. Maybe a more experienced president would have listened to those below him, as the leader of any enterprise of that size must. Maybe a more experienced president would have encouraged and supported governors who were trying to deal with the pandemic, instead of undercutting them. We will never know. What we do know is that our rank amateur didn’t do any of these things and here we are.
 Of course, our bottom line, businessman president was supposed to excel at managing the economy. Just as he had made a pile of money in business, we were going to make money.
 The economy is much worse now than it was when he took office. Because of the pandemic, he gets a pass for the past year. Even if he only made it worse, the pandemic was a special circumstance that would have damaged the economy no matter who was president.
 But, in President Trump’s first three years in office, fewer jobs were created than in President Obama’s last three years. While Mr. Trump campaigned promising a growth rate of 5% to 6%, in reality he never even reached half of that. His growth rate was about what it had been during Mr. Obama’s last three years. He entered office promising to balance the budget. The annual deficit was dramatically higher during his first three years than in any of Mr. Obama’s last three years.
 So this is where we are. Our can do, bottom line amateur has fumbled the biggest challenge of his presidency. His pre-pandemic economy wasn’t the boom he promised; it was only a little worse than the economy he inherited. In no area have things gotten better. If this is what we get from a can-do amateur bringing his good old-fashioned common sense to the problem, I’ll take someone with some experience. It could not get any worse.

A sonobuoy deploys upon impacting the water surface, though, special purpose sonobuoys may operate on task-specific programming. An inflatable component floats on the surface of the water transmitting radio signal for communication with ships and aircrafts, while a stabilizing and hydrophone sensing device descends beneath the surface to a measured depth depending on variables such as search patterns and environmental conditions. The instrument imparts acoustic signals using its hydrophone component via VHF/UHF wireless technology to operators on board ships and aircrafts. The hydrophones also known as transducers converts the sound waves into electrical signals in order to send them to nearby patrolling warships. There are three types of sonobuoy systems used for warfare and non-ware operation — special purpose sonobuoy, passive sonobuoy, and active sonobuoy. It has been noticed that the demand for passive sonobuoy is relatively higher than the other two.
