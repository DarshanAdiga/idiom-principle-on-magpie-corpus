Some of us aren’t ready to frequent any of these businesses, and that’s everyone’s choice. Others are getting a much-needed trim and color first thing this morning. Only time will tell if the weeks spent shuttered will prove to be too much to overcome financially for many of these establishments.            Bars, in particular, have been placed in a precarious situation, as their fate still lies in limbo — but only those that don’t serve food or in which food makes up less than 51% of their sales.            So while you can sit at the bar, decline to order food and do nothing but drink at any of our local restaurants, you’re still not allowed to at any watering hole that doesn’t meet those food-sale requirements.            You can sit at the bar at Outback or Chili’s and have a burger and a beer, but you’re only allowed to get your burger to go at Wendi’s bar on Highway 94 west.            You can sit in the bar at Cafe Del Rio and drink margaritas, or even order some to go, but you aren’t allowed to do either of those things at bars that sell more alcohol than food.            And while you can sit on the patio and enjoy drinks at Cheddars or Ralph & Kacoo’s, heaven forbid someone try to do the same at Jim Ann’s or Bubba T’s.                     *[FT]: Financial Times

The investigation revealed the Yamaha ATV was ridden by 17-year-old Allysha Fischer, of rural Gosper County, and a 15-year-old McCook female.          The ATV was traveling east and entered Road 415 from a private driveway. The ATV was then struck by an F250 Ford pickup, driven by 48-year-old Chad Johnson of rural Cambridge, which was southbound on Road 415, Ocken said.          Ocken said it has not yet been determined who was driving the ATV at the time of the accident. A helmet was found on scene, but it has not been determined if it was in use during the accident, said Ocken.          Fischer was pronounced dead on scene, while the 15-year-old McCook female was first transported to Cambridge Hospital and later life-flighted to Good Samaritan Hospital in Kearney. There were no other details provided about the extent of her injuries.

As Rich mentioned, the strong rebound in site traffic and agent connections we experienced in April and continue to see thus far in May have alleviated much of pressure on issuing discounts.

Like, it's very DIY.”           Leach said that although not every song is critical, when it comes to political issues and the like, music is a big way for their voice to be heard.          “It’s a form of rebellion for us,” Leach said. “Almost like using sounds to express our, you know, general distaste in things.”           When it comes to the world of DJs, Ric Delzell, CEO of Arlington’s Truth Vinyl and graphic design alumnus, has seen a few things.

Delzell said he likes all music and has no favorite, but if he had to pick, music via records is the way to go.          “Records are the closest you could get to the original performance,” Delzell said. “Vinyl has a lot more information on it than digital, so you hear things on vinyl that you can’t hear on other sources. Like, streaming is the worst.”           Sound is a wave form, and digital can’t capture certain parts of it because digital means capture sound in a grid, Delzell said. Combine that with the way digital music is compressed, and you have a recipe for substandard music, he said.          “But everything has its place,” Delzell said. “You can’t play a record while you're running. So, there's nothing wrong with all those sources. It's just if you really want to hear something that sounds as close to the original performance.”           Despite his current status mixing music digitally, Leach said his favorite show he ever played was in his old punk band days, when he played bass in high school. Leach played a show in an abandoned trash incinerator for around a hundred people, he said.          That night cemented Leach’s love for music and small live show settings, even if he moved on to virtual instruments in the years to come.          Leach said his current career dream goal is to make music full-time in a studio. When asked how long he sees himself mixing music, Leach says he’s always jamming on some idea, and that he’s been at it for so long, it’s practically second-nature.          “It's definitely more than a hobby. Sometimes I take that way more seriously than school,” Leach said. “And that's sometimes a problem in my life, but that's okay. That's what I love, you know, so I definitely plan on doing it for forever.”           @Sam_Knowles00          features-editor.shorthorn@uta.edu                  *[FT]: Financial Times

Das neue Wechselkontingent gilt zunächst nur für Wettbewerbe, die zum 31. Dezember 2020 abgeschlossen sein werden, unabhängig davon, ob sie bereits begonnen haben. Die DFL wird die neue Regelung wahrscheinlich übernehmen.

One group of major-label rascals who chose to release their album on time as opposed to waiting out some of the COVID-19-induced constraints that have been placed on the music industry is The Strokes. Their latest album, _The New Abnormal_ , arrived with an average amount of fanfare on April 10—average at least in the context of this band’s colorful trajectory. They released _Room On Fire_ in 2003, two years after charming with their debut _Is This It_ , only to find that critics weren’t interested in hearing more of the same. Three more albums followed in its path, each receiving something varying from a yawn to a head-scratch to a slam from critics. All the while, enthusiasm among fans didn’t dwindle. And as the years have passed, each of _Is This It_ ’s successors have aged with varying degrees of grace. It wouldn’t be so hard to find critics and fans who appreciate the rowdy energy of _Room On Fire_ (that includes this writer), or even the experimental quirks in _Comedown Machine_ (which is often considered the worst of the bunch). A new Strokes album doesn’t mean what it used to mean. We don’t expect to be blown away, right away. It’s taken years for some people to get on board with certain Strokes albums, but for some reason, it’s only taken a few weeks for music fans to warm up to _The New Abnormal_. _—Ellen Johnson_                              *[FT]: Financial Times

BOSTON -- Massachusetts will receive $28 million in fisheries assistance under CARES Act allocations announced Thursday by the federal government, and efforts are ongoing to deliver more aid to an industry that officials say has been hit hard by impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.                                          Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross allocated $300 million in nationwide assistance, saying the Trump administration "stands with the men and women working to provide healthy and safe seafood during this uniquely challenging time."                                          The fisheries support 1.7 million jobs and generate $200 billion in annual sales, he said. Only Alaska and Washington, which are each in line for $50 million in aid, received larger allocations than Massachusetts. Maine received the fifth largest allocation, at $20.3 million.                                          A senior NOAA Fisheries official said the funds will be disbursed "quickly and effectively."                                          Spending plans will be developed by NOAA Fisheries working with interstate marine fishery commissions, and the plans must describe the main categories for funding, including direct payments, fishery-related infrastructure, and fishery-related education to address direct and indirect COVID-19 impacts.                                          Applicants may include commercial fishermen, charter businesses, aquaculture operations, processors, and other fishery-related businesses, according to NOAA Fisheries. "Once a spend plan has been approved by NOAA, the agency anticipates that the three Commissions will review applications and process payments to eligible fishery participants on behalf of the states and territories. The states will have the option to process payments themselves."                                          The commerce department noted that vessel repair businesses, restaurants and seafood retailers are not considered "fishery-related businesses."                                          There's a standard for applying for assistance and each state partner will be required to determine how to verify which applicants meet the threshold of economic revenue losses greater than 35 percent as compared to the prior five-year average, according to NOAA. The timing of funds disbursement will vary, the agency said, and will occur on a rolling basis and without the need for the secretary to first declare a disaster.                                          NOAA also announced Thursday that President Donald Trump signed an executive order to help grow the fishing industry.                                          USDA Seafood Purchasing                                          Earlier this week, members of the Massachusetts Congressional delegation applauded a U.S. Department of Agriculture decision to include Atlantic seafood in so-called Section 32 program food purchases made available in part by the $2.2 trillion CARES Act approved in late March.                                          Massachusetts officials said the federal program has historically overlooked East Coast seafood, but has agreed to purchase $20 million in Atlantic haddock, pollock, and redfish to help East Coast seafood producers.                                          Congressman William Keating, whose district includes New Bedford, said the purchases "will not only help to support our fishing industry during these trying times, but will also provide highly nutritious, sustainable food for families in need across the nation." U.S. Rep. Seth Moulton added, "Fishermen are hurting. Things were already tough because of the trade war and they got a lot tougher when restaurants closed because of the pandemic. Government's strength is measured by its ability to serve the people it represents. I hope this brings new business and peace of mind to America's fishermen."                                          Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey and about two dozen of their colleagues are pressing for more fishing industry aid in the next potential COVID-19 relief law. In a letter on Wednesay to Senate leaders, the senators wrote that while many agricultural sectors "have seen a significant increase in grocery sales, seafood has been left out of that economic upside, as stores have cut back on offerings."                                          Citing reports that many of the nation's fisheries lost 95 percent of their sales, the senators said efforts to limit the spread of COVID-19 have led to a "near total shutdown" of restaurants and outlets that serve fresh seafood and the supply chain of fishermen and seafood processors has been "decimated.                                          The senators asked that the next relief bill include at least $2 billion for the U.S. Department of Agriculture's seafood purchases and authorization for the purchased products to be distributed to local, state, and national non-profits on the frontlines of hunger relief efforts.                                          "The seafood industry is currently facing an unprecedented collapse in demand because of the novel coronavirus," the senators wrote in their letter. "We urge you to facilitate the government purchase of seafood products that would both ensure stability in this key sector and provide healthy, domestically produced food for Americans.                                                                  *[FT]: Financial Times

“I think highly of a lot of these people,” he said. “These are my friends and colleagues, people who I respect, but they tend to be Democrats or liberals, and they were not interested, because of that, in representing Tara Reade.”                                                          Over the weekend, another attorney, William Moran, told the AP he was working with Reade.                                                          Moran, who works at a law firm in Columbia, Maryland, previously wrote and edited for Sputnik, a news agency founded and supported by the Russian state-owned media company Rossiya Segodnya. A January 2017 report released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence on Russia’s interference in the 2016 campaign said Sputnik was part of “Russia’s state-run propaganda machine,” which “contributed to the influence campaign by serving as a platform for Kremlin messaging to Russian and international audiences.”                                                          Reade herself has faced questions about her past writing praising Russian President Vladimir Putin. Reade on Thursday expressed concern to Kelly about having been “called a Russian agent” and said she had received a death threat from someone who “thought I was being a traitor to America.”                                                          There is no evidence to suggest Reade or Moran worked at the behest of Russia with respect to the Biden allegation.                                                          Moran contacted the AP on behalf of Reade to complain about and seek changes in a story detailing what Reade says she remembers writing in a Senate complaint about Biden. Reade told the AP she did not allege sexual assault in the complaint and did not explicitly use the words “sexual harassment,” though that is the behavior she believes she was describing.                                                          Moran told the AP in a text message Thursday that he found the focus on his past work “disgraceful.” He said Reade requested that he reach out to the AP “on a limited matter.”                                                          “I do not turn away clients who I believe and who have credible causes of action. I never will,” he said.                                                          Wigdor said Reade told him she was connected to Moran through Katie Halper, a podcaster who first interviewed Reade about her sexual assault allegation against Biden in March. It’s unclear how Reade connected with Wigdor, who said he believed she found the firm through “word of mouth and our reputation.”                                                          Reade first spoke out about her alleged interactions with Biden in 2019, telling journalists he had touched her inappropriately while she worked on his Senate staff. She came forward in 2020, around the time Biden became the presumptive Democratic nominee, with new allegations of assault.                                                          She says she didn’t initially disclose the assault allegations because she was scared of backlash and was still coming to terms with what had happened to her.                                                                                          *[FT]: Financial Times

PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — Some ski resorts in Oregon are preparing to reopen, but exactly when is still up in the air. Gov. Kate Brown announced earlier this week that some outdoor recreation activities can resume as the coronavirus pandemic continues. Brown is expected to issue an executive order to officially allow ski resorts to resume operations in the coming days, Oregon Public Broadcasting reported. John Burton, spokesman for Timberline Lodge and Ski Area on Mount Hood, said the resort, which touts year-round skiing, has been getting ready to reopen and plans to hire back workers it laid off in April. He said they also plan to hire additional full-time cleaning crews. Depending on when the governor’s executive order comes out, Burton said Timberline could reopen at a limited capacity as early as the end of next week. Operations at other ski resorts in the state are less clear. Dave Tragethon, vice president at Mount Hood Meadows, said it plans to reopen later this year, but the skiing and snowboarding season there has already ended. “We’re working through plans for lodging and culinary services and possibly for some summer operations.” In Bend, Mount Bachelor spokeswoman Leigh Capozzi said their crews are waiting for more guidance from the governor before making any decisions.

"He's (Moyé) focused on her (Luther) because she's the leader of a group of people who want more freedom and liberty to simply do nothing more than earn a living," Norred said.                                                                  "It is really rich for people who are essential workers and who are getting paid a full salary to tell these other people to just take it on the chin," Norred said. "I don't think that's quite right."                                                                  Luther had openly defied the governor's mandate that salons remain closed over the past few weeks, according to KTVT. She had ripped up a cease and desist letter from the county in front of a cheering crowd, and disregarded the judge's order, the station said.

Kilkanaście dni temu, w godzinach porannych, na numer telefonu komórkowego seniorki z Bronowic zadzwonił mężczyzna podający się za policjanta. Ten sam głos w słuchawce kobieta słyszała kilka dni wcześniej i wówczas dała się „nabrać” na opowieść oszusta i przekazała mu znaczną sumę pieniędzy, którą bezpowrotnie straciła. Nauczona tym przykrym doświadczeniem, gdy tylko ponownie rozpoznała głos oszusta, postawiła sobie za cel pokrzyżować jego plany i drugi raz zadziałać właściwie. 80-latka, postanowiła odegrać przed 19-latkiem rolę niczego nieświadomej staruszki, a tymczasem działać racjonalnie i zawiadomić o wszystkim policję. Zaczęła od kontynuowania rozmowy z oszustem, w trakcie której usłyszała, że nadal jako „funkcjonariusz” bierze udział w akcji policyjnej i ponownie konieczne będzie, żeby starsza pani wypłaciła i przekazała mu tym razem 20 tys. złotych. Dzwoniący polecił seniorce pozostawić cały czas włączony telefon z rozmową, tak żeby wiedział, co się dzieje w mieszkaniu oraz oczekiwać na kolejne instrukcje. Kobieta pozornie przystała na te polecenia, tymczasem z innego telefonu zadzwoniła na Policję i zawiadomiła o całej sytuacji. Bardzo szybko w jej mieszkaniu zjawili się policjanci z Wydziału do Walki z Przestępczością Przeciwko Mieniu KMP w Krakowie, którzy wspólnie z 80-latką szykowali zasadzkę na oszusta. Plan był taki, że starsza pani miała wykonywać instrukcje 19-latka, a śledczy mieli jej towarzyszyć cały czas, aż do zatrzymania przestępcy.                              *[FT]: Financial Times

However, it said it decided to proceed with publication to convey key messages on climate change and sustainability, human rights, the importance of multilateralism and debt relief for highly indebted countries.

This can be a great set up for her next movie. She can try to live a life of peace, but she can't escape the influence of Palpatine and the dark side. When Luke started training her in The Last Jedi, she instantly followed the dark side and didn't resist. That inclination to cling to the dark is an interesting aspect to her character. Rey can spend her time trying to learn both sides of force and balance them. The more she does that, the closer the inevitable truth about her lineage will come out. When people discover she's the granddaughter of the evil emperor who oppressed the galaxy, they probably won't be happy about it. It's possible the Lars farm might go up in smoke again.

Wake up smiling. Listen to the loons. Build sandcastles. Gather around the campfire. Watch the sunset.          These might be your typical cottage rules, but now real estate expert and contractor Scott McGillivray is suggesting a new - and improved - way to get the most out of a vacation home.          McGillivray is teaming up with designer Debra Salmoni on Corus Studio's original series Scott's Vacation House Rules to refresh outdated or tired-looking vacation properties in Ontario, transforming them into stylish short-term rentals and a new source of income.          "There's a formula to this," said McGillivray. "It isn't all just random guess and check."          McGillivray's five-rule method is the same for each property, despite the variety in results. Number one is 'Do your research' which essentially means do the math. "I see a lot of people get excited about the hunt and the purchase, and they sort of jump the gun and then try to reverse engineer the numbers to work," cautioned McGillivray.          It's important to understand the local market, he said, determine the potential rental income, consider the cost of financing, repairs, renovations and upkeep, and then decide up front if it's a good business decision.          The second rule - 'Plan your design' - is about fixing the rickety step, replacing broken screens in windows and smoothing over any "funny things" about a cottage that previous owners may have forgiven.          "If you want to use it as a vacation rental, the design has to be obvious and things have to make sense immediately," said McGillivray. "When you show up, there can't be secret procedures to make things work."          Top tips for a strong vacation property design include using open shelves in place of upper cabinets to create a "hassle-free kitchen," making things accessible, and being sure to provide a relaxing outdoor space.          Once you have a plan, devise a marketing angle so your listing will 'Get noticed' - McGillivray's third rule. Throughout the series, his team works on a range of properties in Haliburton Highlands, Prince Edward County, Wasaga Beach and Blue Mountain, and each one gets its own theme. From a Bavarian beer garden to a pet-friendly rental to a beachfront escape, the idea is find a hook to make the property stand out in a crowd.          "There's going to be a million places with decks and hot tubs - but they're just going to say deck and hot tub," he said. "It's a little more exciting to say to your friends, Hey let's book this Bavarian-themed cottage rental - that's pretty cool.'"          McGillivray's final two rules - 'Roll up your sleeves' and 'Be your guest' - are about keeping costs down by pitching in to get the work done and surveying the finished product with a discerning eye. Is there somewhere to place luggage upon entering? Can guests readily hang a coat? Is a fully stocked coffee station in plain view, ready to serve up a warm cup of brew?          "Imagine you are arriving and you just want to relax," said McGillivray. "How nice would it be if everything was ready to go, as if the place was expecting you?"

While the department was not deemed essential, which meant it was among those that were shut down in mid-March, the administration deemed it important enough to hire a deputy director for the Department of Integrated Services for Individuals with Disabilities.                                                                                                                                                                                    Michelle L.C. Perez was hired in April as the deputy director at a rate of $76,345 per year.                                                                                                                                                                                    The government paperwork to bring Perez on board at DISID began when funds were certified to be available on Feb. 26 and a request for personnel action was transmitted to the Bureau of Budget and Management Research on March 6.                                                                                                                                                                                    A notice of personnel action, which was signed April 27, made Perez’s employment effective April 13.                                                                                                                                                                                    According to the Guam Department of Education second quarter staffing pattern, Perez previously held the position of a Teacher IV at Okkodo High School.                                                                                                                                                                                    During a press briefing on Friday, Gov. Lou Leon Guerrero defended the hiring of Perez for an agency that was closed in the middle of the COVID-19 crisis.                                                                                                                                                                                    “We hired the deputy director of DISID because we needed to have that position to provide the services for individuals with disabilities. We needed to make sure we have the necessary operations to provide for our individuals with disabilities. We wanted to make sure that individuals with disabilities are given the vocational trainings so that they can be self-sufficient and so that they can provide for their own self-reliance and self-sustenance,” the governor said.                                                                                                                                                                                    With the director, Phyliss Leon Guerrero, and the new deputy director working at the government quarantine site at Pacific Star making an additional 15% differential pay and the agency closed since mid-March when the government was shut down, it is unclear what services and training were provided to DISID consumers.                                                                                                                                                                                    The governor insisted the position had been filled before the pandemic and before March.                                                                                                                                                                                    “My recollection was this individual was hired before then. It may be a processing thing. I don’t know, but I do know we made the decision to hire the person," the governor said. "I was involved with Phyliss in hiring the individual so it may be a processing thing."                                                                                                                                                                                    DISID is not among the list of government agencies that are set to open next week with the declaration of Pandemic Condition of Readiness 2.                                                                                                                                                                                    Two former DISID directors said it would have been better if the government had hired to fill other vacant positions at DISID instead of hiring a deputy director for the limited staff.                                                                                                                                                                                    In 1995, the agency was just being stood up to meet with new federal requirements to help adults with special abilities.                                                                                                                                                                                    The agency had a staff of 46, five new programs and a lot of federal training to go through, said then-director Joseph Cameron.                                                                                                                                                                                    At the time, he had two deputy directors to assist, but several years after he left the agency, Cameron said, some of the programs and their employees were parceled out after DISID and the Behavioral Health and Wellness Center fell under federal receivership.                                                                                                                                                                                    Former Director Ben Servino, who started in 2011, said he had more than 20 employees and no deputy director. In an effort to do his part to save the government money, he said, he never pushed for one. He had hoped to hire administrators to run the two remaining programs, vocational rehabilitation and support services, which became vacant several years into his term. He said he was never able to find people with the skills and certification needed for the positions, however, and he ended up taking on the duties of both jobs later in the eight years he was at DISID.                                                                                                                                                                                    “It would have made more sense to fill pertinent classified employees, who would work with federal counterparts and provide continuity beyond each new administration,” he said.                                                                                                                                                                                    “There was a lot of building up that needed to be done when I came on board. The agency had fallen into a receivership along with Behavioral Health and Wellness Center several years prior … we had to work really hard to get out of that …and we did it without a deputy director," he said.                                                                                                                                                                                    During a Special Economic Services meeting with lawmakers on Thursday, BBMR Director Lester Carlson was asked by Sen.

It wasn't long ago that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had Israel's High Court firmly in his crosshairs. His bloc of right-wing and religious allies, too, would consistently hammer away at the court. One minister accused it of "impertinence" and "contempt." A deputy minister said it was trying to establish a "judicial dictatorship." There were frequent calls to simply ignore court rulings.                          Now, though, it is the High Court that has cemented Netanyahu's election victory and paved the way for him to hold on to the leadership of the country. In a unanimous decision, an expanded panel of 11 justices ruled this week that an indicted member of Knesset could be given the mandate to form a government. And that's exactly what happened late Thursday afternoon, when President Reuven Rivlin gave Netanyahu two weeks to put the finishing touches to his planned government with one-time opponent Benny Gantz. Both men have indicated they won't need that long, with a swearing-in ceremony penciled in for next Wednesday.                          No longer will Netanyahu be the leader of a transitional government plowing its way through three consecutive elections. Barring any frankly unforeseen obstacles, he will once again be Israel's sitting prime minister, this time with the backing of at least 72 members of the 120-seat parliament, making this the widest, strongest coalition he has ever led -- at least on paper.                                          *[FT]: Financial Times

It's hard to stay focused on work when you have access to a TV at all times, and you don't have a boss standing over you to catch you streaming content on your laptop instead of tackling job-related tasks. In fact, about 30% of at-home workers blame the distraction of TV and media on their lack of productivity. But remember, if your productivity drops to an unacceptable level, you could end up in a situation where your job's on the line, and in today's extremely shaky economy, that's not a good place to be. So, schedule time for TV and internet breaks rather than sneak them in. If you have that time blocked off in your schedule, you'll be less likely to get sidetracked when you're supposed to be doing actual work.

El Trinche had other ideas. Showing off his full repertoire of tricks in the middle of the park – his signature move was said to be the 'double nutmeg', where he would drag the ball through the legs of his opponent twice in a single passage of play – he ran the show as the Rosario Selection went into half-time 2-0 up. “They were asking us to take it easy,” Carlos Aimar, who lined up alongside Carlovich in midfield, recalled to _DeporTV_ . The star did not take part in the second half, raising suspicions, albeit never confirmed, that he was withdrawn to spare the blushes of the national team, who nevertheless limped to a 3-1 defeat after Kempes netted after the break.                     *[FT]: Financial Times

Airing two episodes a week on Sunday nights, the series is now two weeks away from its conclusion and is well worth a watch or two or three.          The story of how the series came about was that the Bulls made clear before the 1997-98 season that it would be the final season for Phil Jackson as the head coach. Jordan responded by publicly announcing that if the team would not resign Jackson as the head coach, he would not come back and play the next season.          Thus, the NBA and the Bulls, thinking this was likely the final season of one of the best, if not the very best, players in the history of the league, allowed a camera crew to follow the team. The crew had unrivaled access, following the team as it traveled, in the locker room, and a great deal many places media would not usually be allowed.          The footage collected during that season is now being released for the first time in this series.          So, if you ever wanted to see behind the scenes of a professional sports franchise, this is about as close as you can get without actually being there.          In this case, the details are particularly juicy, getting into the rift between General Manager Jerry Krause and the team, including stars like Jordan and Scottie Pippen and the coach, Jackson.          In 1997, with the Bulls having won five of the last seven NBA championships, Krause suddenly wanted to build for the future of the team.

While local grocery stores have come a long way in stocking organic produce, going to the grocery has become a harrowing adventure of sorts over the past several weeks.                                                                  The stores themselves are one of the few places open since Gov. Evers issued Safer-at-Home orders in March, which were recently extended into late May to combat the spread of COVID-19. They are essential businesses, and they are packed these days with people. Some customers wear masks to prevent spreading or contracting the novel coronavirus, while others do not. Then there’s the recommended sanitizing of clothing and grocery packaging once shoppers arrive home.                                                                  For those buying produce, meat or eggs from CSAs like this one, they can make fewer trips to the grocery store.                                                                  “At the farm, we are incredibly fortunate to be considered ‘essential’ and that we are able to continue our work in the field and in the greenhouse growing seeds that will grow into nutritious food to nourish families in the months ahead,” Meg Kelly said in a recent newsletter to subscribers. “For the first time that I can remember, we are completely sold out of spring and summer CSA shares as of early April. We look forward to safely delivering high quality, organic produce to you throughout the summer and fall.                                                                  “The team here has been busy planting seeds, transplanting into our high tunnel, preparing the fields for planting, un-winterizing our work areas where we will be packing vegetables into boxes soon. Our chickens have been out on pasture for a few weeks already and we are coming to the end of the busiest part of our lambing season. We will be happy to let the sheep back out into lush pastures soon.”                                                                  As for COVID-19 and how it will affect the farm and its members, the Kellys are taking the pandemic seriously and are working with employees and their site hosts to be sure they can pass along shares to customers in the safest way possible.

Football's lawmakers have approved a temporary rule change that will allow each side up to five substitutes per match while opening up the prospect for the controversial video assistant referee system to be suspended.

The games are still on hold, but Toronto's main pro sports teams are getting a cautionary green light to start working out in small numbers.          Almost two months after the Raptors and Maple Leafs halted their seasons due to COVID-19 concerns, the Ontario government was set to announce Friday that practice facilities can commence limited reopenings.          In the Leafs case, that means the Ford Performance Centre in Etobicoke and for the Raptors, the OVO Athletic Centre at Exhibition Place.          But there won't be a rush to the rink. A government source said only a few players, likely up to four, will be allowed on the surface at a time to use one basketball or hockey net. And only team training and medical staff will be allowed to work with players, no private therapists.          But this could be the signal for Leafs and other NHLers now waiting out the pandemic in the United States and Europe to make plans to return for mandatory two-week quarantining. While many theories have been put forward about restarting the NHL and NBA seasons, nothing is official.          lhornby@postmedia.com

Amid signs that at least a partial reopening of Pennsylvania’s economy could take place this month, the state’s weekly unemployment claim filings continued to drift back toward normalcy, although they remain far above numbers seen before the COVID-19 crisis.            The U.S. Department of Labor reported Thursday morning that another 96,603 Pennsylvania residents filed for jobless benefits during the week ending May 2. That brings the state’s total unemployment filing number over the course of the past seven weeks to about 1.7 million.            The latest numbers are a 24 percent decline from the previous week, but still well above the 15,439 unemployment claims the state recorded for the week ending March 14, the last before widespread shutdowns across the country began to drive a surge in business closures and layoffs.                     *[FT]: Financial Times

Football teams will be allowed to use five substitutes when play resumes after the coronavirus pandemic, the sport's law-making body announced on Friday.          The International Football Association Board (IFAB) said in as statement that it had agreed to a proposal by world governing body FIFA for a temporary change to the rules "to protect player welfare".          Teams face likely fixture congestion in a packed calendar as they attempt to make up for lost time when play can resume.          The lay off is expected to have an impact on player fitness levels too.          It also said that competitions which were using video assistant referee (VAR) would be allowed to drop it for the time being.          The change will apply to competitions scheduled to be completed by 31 December of this year, although FIFA and IFAB left open the possibility that the period could be extended.          While teams will be able to make five substitutions, "to avoid disruption to the game, each team will only have three opportunities to make substitutions" as well as at half time or before extra time.          In competitions that allow an additional substitution in extra time, teams will have an additional substitution opportunity.          The previous limit on outfield substitutes for top-level competitions has been three in regulation time.           The IFAB said the change had been made "as matches may be played in a condensed period in different weather conditions, both of which could have impacts on player welfare."          It added that "the decision on whether to apply this temporary amendment will remain at the discretion of each individual competition organiser."          It said that, together with FIFA, it "will determine at a later stage whether this temporary amendment would need to be extended further.          That means the measure could be maintained for the whole of the 2020-21 season and right through to the next European Championship, which was postponed by a year until June and July 2021 because of the pandemic.          "If the measure is still in force, UEFA could then adopt it for the Euro," a source said.          It remains to be seen if the measure could be left in place permanently, but doing so may play into the hands of the wealthiest clubs with the largest squads and greatest strength in depth.                  *[FT]: Financial Times

Inter have returned to the fray for Barcelona midfielder Arturo Vidal, who could help form part of the deal that takes Lautaro Martinez to Camp Nou.            El Mundo Deportivo cite reports from Italian media outlet Tuttosport that should the Argentine striker join the Blaugrana, the former Juventus midfielder would be heading the other way.            It follows within a day of a report in El Mundo Deportivo that, whilst there were a lot of suitors for the central midfielder, Barcelona had yet to receive a formal offer.            Vidal is said to have a transfer valuation of between €15m and €20m, while the Chilean midfielder has started just 13 matches across all competitions for the Blaugrana despite scoring in six different matches in La Liga to date, and is said to be keen to play more first team football.            His agent Fernando Felicevich is said to be keen to facilitate a transfer and Inter have been strongly linked – the Milanese giants also signed the agent’s client and fellow Chile international Alexis Sanchez recently.            The Chilean looked set for Inter in the summer of 2018 until the Blaugrana swooped in late to sign him from Bayern Munich, while he previously thrived under Antonio Conte at Juventus.            The arrival of Dutch international Frenkie De Jong at the Camp Nou last summer pushed Vidal further down the pecking order and Inter boss Conte is waiting to make an offer should he look to move on from Catalonia.            				                     *[FT]: Financial Times

THE Dr. Kerlin Cup was first contested in 1936 and has been played every year since.                However, 2020 is very much up in the air due, allegedly, to a China man cooking a bat!               Cups are won but, rarely, is there much thought put into who it is named after.                But, then, Dr Kerlin was no ordinary man.               Joseph P. Kerlin was born in Glenullin in 1885, the son of two schoolteachers Patrick and Philomena.                It is a remarkable coincidence that three of the four main cups played for in North Derry are in memory of three men born in Glenullin.                The others are James O’Hagan, an uncle, and Harry O’Kane, the late father of well known photographer Danny O’Kane.               As a boy, Kerlin attended primary school in Glenullin but he had Claudy connections.                His father came from Craigbane in the rural end of the Claudy parish where the name Kerlin is still quite common.               His secondary education was in St. Columb’s College Derry.                From there, he enrolled in the Catholic University of Medicine in Dublin. There he proved to be a student of outstanding ability. He was top of the class in virtually every phase of medicine; In his third year he had seven firsts.               “He was the best man in his class on four occasions. I regard Dr Kerlin as one of the best men who has gone through this school,” said one of his tutors.                He qualified as a doctor at the age of 23 and two years later, in 1910, the Bishop of Derry, the Rev. Charles McHugh, gave Dr Kerlin a glowing reference. “He is sure to devote himself with painstaking care and intelligence to the duties put before him,” he said.               He set up his practice in Magherafelt in that year and it lasted until 1961 when he died at the age of 76.               His prowess as a doctor cannot be overstated, as was detailed in a report after an incident at 1am on June 5 1921.                A party of RIC men were ambushed in Swatragh, resulting in Sergeant Michael Burke being shot dead and Constable John Kennedy shot in the throat and back.                Kennedy was taken to Coleraine Cottage Hospital and Dr. Kerlin brought all the way from Magherafelt to attend him.                Kennedy had been shot through the wind pipe and, after treatment, was transferred to the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast where he is said to have made a full recovery.               An indication of the fear that gripped the country at that time struck again later that day just a few miles from Swatragh.                27-year-old Alexander O’Connor from Glack and his friend, John Harkin from Limavady, were cycling on the Ballintemple Road between Garvagh and Glenullin when O’Connor was shot dead under mysterious circumstances.                O’Connor may have had connections with O’Connor’s Glack GAA who played in the 1921/22 North Derry League.               With the GAA coming and going in North Derry, until 1936 when a meeting in Claudy set up a district board.                This was to last until the county was restructured in 2007 which resulted in the Kerlin Cup losing a lot of its earlier prestige.                The attendances dropped from a few thousand to a few hundred or less.                                           *[FT]: Financial Times

The Supreme Court of Texas' orders came shortly after Abbott modified his Covid-19 executive order to "eliminate confinement as a punishment for violating the order," Abbott said in a statement.

"Throwing Texans in jail who have had their businesses shut down through no fault of their own is nonsensical, and I will not allow it to happen," Abbott said. "As some county judges advocate for releasing hardened criminals from jail to prevent the spread of COVID-19, it is absurd to have these business owners take their place."

Tucker did not immediately respond to a phone message or an email.                                  The outcry over the killing reached the White House, where President Donald Trump offered condolences to Arbery’s family. He spoke again about the case Friday morning in an interview on Fox News Channel, saying “I saw the tape and it’s very, very disturbing."                                  “It’s a heartbreak. … Very rough, rough stuff," Trump added. "Justice getting done is what solves that problem. It’s in the hands of the governor and I’m sure he’ll do the right thing.”                                  Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden called Arbery’s death a “murder.” During an online roundtable Thursday, Biden said the video shows Arbery “lynched before our very eyes.”                                  The outside prosecutor now overseeing the case, Tom Durden, had said Monday that he wanted a grand jury to decide whether charges are warranted.

JOHANNESBURG (AP) — The coronavirus could “smolder” in Africa for years and take a high death toll across the continent, the World Health Organization has warned.                                  The virus is spreading in Africa, but so far the continent has not seen a dramatic explosion in the number of confirmed cases.                                  More than 52,000 confirmed infections and 2,074 virus-related deaths have been reported by African countries, according to figures released Friday by the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The total number of cases has risen by more than 42% in the past week.                                   The disease appears to be spreading more slowly across Africa than in Europe, according to  the WHO report. Officials say that could be due to poor surveillance or less developed transport links.                                   “While COVID-19 likely won’t spread as exponentially in Africa as it has elsewhere in the world, it likely will smolder in transmission hotspots,” said Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, WHO's regional director for Africa who is based in Brazzaville, Republic of Congo. She said outbreaks would likely peak about one month after the virus starts spreading widely in communities.                                  “COVID-19 could become a fixture in our lives for the next several years unless a proactive approach is taken by many governments in the region. We need to test, trace, isolate and treat,” Moeti said in a video call.                                                      *[FT]: Financial Times

How many of you have bought GTA V on PS3 and PS4? What about Mario Kart 8 on Wii U and Nintendo Switch? Okay, but what about Forza Horizon 2 on Xbox 360 and then on Xbox One? Well, the time of "double-dipping" seems to be coming to an end if more publishers follow the current trend. As first introduced by Microsoft as "Smart Delivery" for its Xbox ecosystem, and as followed by some developers such as CD Projekt Red with Cyberpunk 2077, now EA is seemingly joining the "buy our current-gen game, update to next-gen for free" trend, something many users will for sure welcome.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         It's one of the news coming from Electronic Arts' quarterly call, as CFO Blake Jorgensen commented on the possibility of new cross-gen releases. Without going into specifics on the affected franchises of platforms, and with Battlefield VI (or whatever it is called in the end) releasing no earlier than April 2021, one could think of FIFA 21 as perhaps the more obvious choice for the transitional release, but at the same time if the jump to Xbox Series X and PS5 means new engine and building from scratch for some projects, then its best-selling game might end up being one of the bunch saved for double-cashing.

There are agents now panicking that middle men will go out of business as far as the lower leagues are concerned; that clubs will deal directly with players. Imagine that?

As we see the amazing fund-raising efforts for the vital work the NHS is doing and for the equipment that doctors, nurses and carers need to do their jobs and stay alive, it’s made me uneasy to read about players on private jets and breaking lockdown rules or betting rules.

Zack Kassian has become the heart and soul of the Oilers. His comeback story has been well-documented, and every game it was like he was showing the Oilers they made the right choice giving him a second chance. He was a changed man since his battle with substance abuse. Big 44 had wrecking ball shifts, sweet-handed scoring shifts, and chirping shifts. But every time he was on the ice, Kassian was observed by the opposition and cheered by the fans. Kassian was the key figure in the battle against the villain and to watch him in the playoffs again, well, that makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up just thinking about it.                                                                                          *[FT]: Financial Times

As the COVID-19 virus cripples the economy, leaving millions unemployed and many companies on life support, big businesses that have become synonymous with the world’s largest prison system are still making money.                                                          “It’s hard. Especially at a time like this, when you’re out of work, you’re waiting for unemployment … and you don’t have money to send,” said Keturah Bryan, who transfers hundreds of dollars each month to her 64-year-old father at a federal prison in Oklahoma.                                                          Meanwhile, she said, prisons continue to gouge.                                                          “You have to pay for phone calls, emails, food," she said. "Everything.”                                                          The coronavirus outbreak has put an unlikely spotlight on America’s jails and prisons, which house more than 2.2 million people and have been described by health experts as petri dishes as the virus spreads.                                                          Masks and hand sanitizer often aren't provided. Testing is rarely carried out, even among those with symptoms, despite fears that surrounding communities may be affected. And in some parts of the country, those sickened by the virus languish in sweltering buildings with poor ventilation.                                                          The concerns extend to outsourced prison health care, frequently accused by experts of offering substandard treatment even in the best of times.                                                          Sheron Edwards shares a dorm with 50 other men at Chickasaw County Regional Correctional Facility in Mississippi. Given his past experiences with the prison’s medical provider, Centurion, he worries about what will happen if coronavirus hits.                                                          “I’m afraid they’ll just let us die in here,” he said.                                                          When he was at the state's notorious Parchman prison several years ago, Edwards said the company refused to pay for costly heart medication and only provided one session of physical therapy when he had to have a six-inch rod and screws placed in his broken ankle.                                                          “Even though that wasn’t life threatening, it was serious,” he said. “With COVID-19, I could actually lose my life.”                                                          More than 20,000 prisoners have been infected and 295 have died nationwide — from Rikers Island in New York City to federal, state, and local lockups coast to coast, according to an unofficial tally kept by the COVID-19 Behind Bars Data Project run by UCLA Law.                                                          On Wednesday, officials in San Diego announced the first death of a detainee in a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center.                                                          When incarceration rates soared to record highs in the 1980s and ’90s, some corporations saw a business opportunity. They promised lower costs and, in many cases, profit-sharing agreements. Prison and jail administrators started privatizing everything from food and commissary to entire operations of facilities.                                                          Proponents of for-profit prisons say it’s cheaper for private companies to run facilities than the government, arguing it’s easier to cancel contracts and there is more incentive to provide better service. They say that leads to improved living conditions and more effective rehabilitation of the incarcerated back into society with the ultimate goal of reducing recidivism.                                                                                          *[FT]: Financial Times

Louisiana’s very own three-toed amphiuma swims in our lakes and ponds, mingling beneath the ducks. Although out of sight, these creatures spend their time eating their favorite food—crawfish. Amphiuma are one of the largest species of salamanders, reaching up to 43 inches.                                                                  “I’ve seen them along Nicholson Drive because a lot of amphiuma live along there. It’s very easy to see them because the water is shallow, and you can see them walking up to prey to catch crawfish,” said Dr. John Pojman, award-winning chemist and chair of the LSU Chemistry Department.                                                                  Amphiuma are one of the only amphibian species thriving in a crisis that is currently affecting their cold-blooded frog and toad friends.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. government on Friday is poised to report the worst set of jobs numbers since record-keeping began in 1948, a snapshot of the devastating damage the coronavirus outbreak has inflicted on the economy.                                                          The unemployment rate for April could reach 16% or more, according to economists surveyed by the data provider FactSet. Twenty-one million jobs may have been lost. If so, it would mean that nearly all the job growth in the 11 years since the Great Recession ended had vanished in one month.                                                          Even those numbers won't fully capture the scope of the damage the coronavirus has inflicted on jobs and incomes. Many people who are still employed have had their hours reduced. Others have suffered pay cuts. Some who lost jobs in April and didn’t look for a new one in light of their bleak prospects won’t even be counted as unemployed. A broader measure — the proportion of adults with jobs — could hit a record low.                                                                                          *[FT]: Financial Times

Over the past decade or so the NEB softball team was blessed with some of the fastest, most sure-handed center fielders you could find.                                                                                                                                                                                    First it was Alycia Parks. Then Johnson. And graduating this year it was Jordan Shumway.                                                                                                                                                                                    All were gold glove winners.                                                                                                                                                                                    All were all-state players.                                                                                                                                                                                    All had catches worth of ESPN’s web gems nearly every night.                                                                                                                                                                                    It started with Parks. We started our gold glove awards in large part because of how good she was defensively.                                                                                                                                                                                    She was our first defensive player of the year in the region, for good reason.                                                                                                                                                                                    You could almost never get a ball past her in the outfield. HIt it in her direction, you were headed back to the dugout after being called out.                                                                                                                                                                                    More recently you had Shumway.                                                                                                                                                                                    Watch her play and you’ll remember catches where she was fully extended, flying through the air.                                                                                                                                                                                    You’ll remember running catches as she got to the fence.                                                                                                                                                                                    The thing with both Parks and Shumway, it wasn’t just about the glove either.                                                                                                                                                                                    Both had blazing speed, and used it to their advantage.                                                                                                                                                                                    Lay down a bunt and it’s a single. It was nearly impossible to throw either one out.                                                                                                                                                                                    They were always the catalysts to their teams offense, hitting near the top of the lineup and getting on base to set the table for everyone in the middle of the lineup.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 *[FT]: Financial Times

Today marks 48 days since the last “last call” rang out at bars across the state at midnight March 21.            That also marked the closure of all dine-in restaurants and gyms, per Gov. Greg Abbott’s executive order. Ten days later, all non-essential businesses followed suit, including hair salons and barbershops, tattoo parlors and piercing studios, and other related services.            Since that time, Abbott has loosened restrictions so that all the aforementioned businesses could reopen under limited capacity and under certain guidelines, with hair salons, barbershops, tanning salons and nail salons set to reopen today, while gyms will follow suit on May 18.                     *[FT]: Financial Times

The Elker said said his favorite game was was the District 9 2A championship his senior year because “it was a moment I shared with my closest friends.”            Ridgway beat Clarion in a shootout, 56-35, in that game after the Elkers had blanked the Bobcats, 42-0, in the regular season.            Gresco had a big night in that win, going 13 of 17 for 240 yards with five TDs and no interceptions — which equates to a QB Rating of 157.5.            As for baseball, Gresco started that sport as a youth in the coach pitch league in Ridgway. He went to to earn three varsity letters in the sport playing for Johnsonburg through the schools’ co-op, something they have for a majority of their fall and spring sports — including football.            Gresco, who largely played first base for the Rams, won a District 9 Class 2A title with Johnsonburg as a sophomore and scored a run in a 12-7 win against Brockway in the title game that season.            His best year stat-wise on the diamond came as a junior when he hit .256 (11-for-43) with a home run, two RBIs and five runs scored.            However, he didn’t get the opportunity to finish out his high school baseball career with all spring sports cancelled and schools closed because of COVID-19.            “As a senior I am disappointed in the decision, but I do understand the actions that authorities have taken to control the situation,” he said. “I am hopeful that these precautions keep everyone safe, and that we can return to normal as soon as possible.”            When asked why he loves to play sports, Gresco said, “Being able to compete against someone who is better than you everyday.” He went on to say football is his favorite sport because “it creates an environment that no other sport has for me.”            Outside of sports and school, Gresco loves the outdoors, music and being with his friends. He likes hiking, skiing, biking, hunting and fishing. He also enjoys playing the guitar and piano in his free free time.            Gresco pointed to a non-sports person as one of his role models.            “Elon Musk (co-founder and CEO of Tesla) is one of my role models because of the way he thinks and approaches everyday life,” said the Elker.            The son of Brian and Sara Gresco, the Elker senior has an older sister Madeline who competed in gymnastics and cheerleading and a younger brother Mike who plays football and runs track.            After graduation, Gresco plans to attend Penn State and study chemical engineering.                     *[FT]: Financial Times

Just like everything else Brian Kemp has done over the past couple years (and presumably his entire life), this was a terrible idea. Luckily, the temporary rule is set to expire in mid-May. For some reason, Wisconsin is also looking to adopt the same executive order, scrapping its road test for the time being. So, add that to your list of reasons to never visit Wisconsin.                     *[FT]: Financial Times

Tuesday, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott announced a reopening of certain businesses starting May 8. According to Abbott's orders, salons are allowed to open May 8, with restrictions such as one customer per stylist and 6 feet between stations and customers waiting. Masks are strongly recommended but aren't mandatory.                                                                  Moyé said he'd consider only giving her a fine if she apologized, acknowledged she was wrong and agreed to keep her business closed until Friday, when the governor has announced all salons may open, according to CNN affiliate KTVT.                                                                  "If you would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge that your actions were selfish, putting your own interest ahead of those in the community in which you live," Moyé said to Luther inside the courtroom Tuesday.                                                                  Luther refused.                                                                  "I have to disagree with you sir, when you say that I'm selfish because feeding my kids is not selfish," she said. "I have hairstylists that are going hungry because they'd rather feed their kids. So sir, if you think the law is more important than kids being fed then please go ahead with your decision but I'm not going to shut the salon."                                                                  However on Wednesday, Abbott released a statement saying he disagrees with Moyé's decision.                                                                  "As I have made clear through prior pronouncements, jailing Texans for non-compliance with executive orders should always be the last available option," he said. "Compliance with executive orders during this pandemic is important to ensure public safety; however, surely there are less restrictive means to achieving that goal than jailing a Texas mother."                                                                                                      *[FT]: Financial Times

There’s also Chris McKenna, who perhaps stood out the most for his credited work on episodes like the should-have-been-Emmy-nominated “Remedial Chaos Theory,” and now probably makes pretty decent money writing Marvel movies. Speaking of the MCU, directors Joe and Anthony Russo, who, prior to becoming instrumental to Phases 2 and 3 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, were responsible for much of _Community_ ’s visual style, though other directors did get the opportunity to bring their own flair to the screen, most notably _Fast and Furious_ director Justin Lin, responsible for “Modern Warfare,” arguably the greatest episode of all time.                              *[FT]: Financial Times

Most notably, the administration has refused numerous requests, including by Spotlight PA and The Inquirer, to release documents related to its controversial process of granting waivers to allow certain businesses to reopen during the statewide shutdown.            “The administration’s response to the pandemic has been opaque at best and raised a lot of questions,” said Rep. Seth Grove (R., York), who authored the bill, which would require state departments to continue processing Right-to-Know Law requests during a disaster declaration.

The measure passed Tuesday with near unanimous support, garnering the support of all but one lawmaker, who was absent. The bill had previously advanced from a committee with no support from Democrats. It now goes to the Senate for consideration.            Asked Tuesday about the issue, Wolf — who positioned himself as a champion of government transparency during his campaigns for governor — said staff who process public records requests have been laid off or are “addressing the challenges” created by COVID-19.            “I’m trying to be transparent, and we’re focused on doing everything we can to keep people informed as to how we’re doing,” Wolf said. “I draw a distinction between transparency and following specific rules for things that are mandated that we might not have the capacity to do while we’re in this emergency.”            Lyndsay Kensinger, a spokesperson for Wolf, said the administration does not support the bill, but did not specify if the governor would veto it.            “Since the first confirmed case, the administration has maintained consistent contact with both state and local officials and will continue to do so throughout this public health crisis,” she said.            Kensinger also noted that the executive branch is “fully subject” to the open records statute, “unlike the legislature,” which exempted lawmakers’ emails and other records when writing the law.                     *[FT]: Financial Times

“For the kids in circus, this is what they do in the summer,” she said. “They give up their vacations. Some are practicing every day. The circus kids are like a family. It was such a letdown to cancel, and a lot of these kids are already really let down because they’re missing things. Now, this is being taken away.”                                                                          But even with the performances canceled, organizers are hopeful they can still hold the Circus City Festival, which is made up of a downtown fair with rides, food and games, as well as the annual circus parade.                                                                          Maverick said they are currently moving forward with organizing the events, but whether it ends up happening is still pending until they have more details from the state on how restrictions will be lifted.                                                                          “We want to make it happen if we can,” she said. “The festival is for the community, and we’d love to use it as a way to celebrate if things are back to normal, but that’s still up in the air. We have to wait and see what happens.”                                                                          But no matter what happens, the circus isn’t going anywhere, volunteer Brehmer said. After more than six decades in the community, the show will go far into the future despite this year’s cancellation.                                                                          “It’s a big deal for our community,” she said. “This is a hard pill to swallow, but we’ll be all right and come back strong next year. That’s what we do as a circus family. We come together and stay strong.”                                                                                                                  *[FT]: Financial Times

El Trinche had other ideas. Showing off his full repertoire of tricks in the middle of the park – his signature move was said to be the 'double nutmeg', where he would drag the ball through the legs of his opponent twice in a single passage of play – he ran the show as the Rosario Selection went into half-time 2-0 up. “They were asking us to take it easy,” Carlos Aimar, who lined up alongside Carlovich in midfield, recalled to _DeporTV_ . The star did not take part in the second half, raising suspicions, albeit never confirmed, that he was withdrawn to spare the blushes of the national team, who nevertheless limped to a 3-1 defeat after Kempes netted after the break.                  *[FT]: Financial Times

Arsenal finally have a positive aura about them under new manager Mikel Arteta, and we are now claimed to have three of the best 10 teenagers on our books.                                                                          FootballScout has named a list of 50 top teenagers in world football this week, with three of the top 10 all signed up with Arsenal.                                                                          Mason Greenwood is the highest ranked Premier League player on the list, followed by Gabriel Martinelli, Bukayo Saka and William Saliba in 6th, 9th and 10th respectively.                                                                          We will be going into next season with three of the brightest young talents in world football, assuming we do not see any shock move for Saka or Martinelli, but we will also have one of the youngest and most exciting managers to grow with them.                                                                          The Spaniard has already shown in such a short time at the club how much of an impact he can make, using the same squad of failing players that Unai Emery had at his disposal.                                                                          Young Saka is supposedly being targeted for a move this summer, and our club must be careful not to allow the 18 year-old to have his head turned.                                                                          Our current problem is that we have so far been unable to convince the winger/makeshift left-back to sign a new contract at present, and has just over 12 months remaining on his current deal.                                                                          Arsenal must do all they can to cement the youngsters stay at the club for the long-term, and build the rest of the team around these exciting talents.                                                                          Will we have any issues with extending Saka’s contract? Would keeping the trio on the long-term guarantee us as strong competitors across the board for the coming years?

“While COVID-19 likely won’t spread as exponentially in Africa as it has elsewhere in the world, it likely will smolder in transmission hotspots,” said Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, WHO's regional director for Africa who is based in Brazzaville, Republic of Congo. She said outbreaks would likely peak about one month after the virus starts spreading widely in communities.

Ballerin played in 19 finals between 1947 and 1975, winning ten and losing nine.                Their first success came in 1952 when they beat Glack by 5-3 to 0-2 and their last in 1974 with 3-11 to 3-7 victory over Banagher in one of the best finals ever seen at the ‘Green.’                They were also involved in two remarkable comebacks.                In 1960, they trailed hosts Claudy by 2-5 to 0-1 at half-time but 1-3 from Brian Mullan and 2-0 from Dermot Mullan saw them emerge winners by 3-4 to 2-5.                That team was Bobby Mullan, Peter McKinney, John McCorriston, Hugh O’Connell, Willie Harkin, Gerald Mullan, Paddy O’Connell, Brian Mullan, Dermot Mullan, Patsy Lynch, Jim ‘Twin’ Mullan and John Faulkner.                In 1967 they looked dead and buried at half-time, trailing Drumsurn by eight points but a second half tally of 3-4 by Sean O’Connell saw a complete turn around and a 4-8 to 4-2 victory.                 Since contesting every final from 1965 to 1975 they have only been back once and that was a defeat to Claudy in 1985 by 1-10 to 0-5.                Two Ballerin players - Paddy O’Connell and Sean McGahon, with ten medals each - are believed to be the most successful players in Kerlin Cup history.               An indication of just how competitive this cup was can be indicated by the 1957 final.                Ballerin won the Derry championship that year and their only defeat in 29 games was against Claudy in the Dr. Kerlin Cup final.                Claudy won by the somewhat unusual score of 4-3 to 3-4.                That Claudy team consisted of Patsy Gormley, John Devine, Mickey J Donaghy, G. Peoples, John White, Seamus Bryce, M. McLaughlin, J. McCloskey, Johnny Burke, Michael Donaghy, Patsy’Pickles’ McCloskey, Tony Gormley and Seamus Lynch.

PALMER, Alaska (AP) — An Alaska school board postponed a vote over rescinding a ban on selected English course books after taking public testimony on the issue that attracted national attention when a Grammy-winning rock group pledged to purchase the banned books for students. The Matanuska- Susitna Borough School District board heard three hours of testimony Wednesday on a proposal to rescind last month’s vote to remove five American literature classics from high school English elective courses. The board is scheduled to vote on the proposal May 20. The list of books includes F. Scott Fitzgerald’s “The Great Gatsby,” Joseph Heller’s \"Catch-22,” Maya Angelou’s “I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,\" Ralph Ellison's “Invisible Man,” and Tim O’Brien's “The Things They Carried.” Members of the band Portugal. The Man stepped into the controversy in their Alaska hometown by offering to buy copies of the books for students and families. At least 80 people registered to submit testimony by phone rather than in person Wednesday because of health restrictions resulting from the coronavirus pandemic. The majority favored rescinding the board's decision to ban the novels from reading lists. The board also removed The New York Times’ The Learning Network as a teaching resource, although journalism students are permitted to use the newspaper. “This was placed back on the agenda because of the difficulties we’re having with COVID, the inability for the community to speak, and also in light of the previous vote, information has been brought forth that needs to be considered in this option,” school board President Tom Bergey said during the meeting. For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear...

“To reduce the number of people working on the farm at once, we are depending heavily on trained and paid employees to work extra hard to get produce from seed stages to (customers’) tables,” Meg Kelly said. “We are working with our workplace drop sites to have alternate pick up sites for their members in the event their offices and businesses remain closed into June.”                                                                  Like many local farmers, the Kellys have traditionally earned additional revenue selling their wares at farmers’ markets. Fort Atkinson’s first farmers’ market of the season will be held on Saturday. Watertown’s first Farmers Market will be on Tuesday, May 26, the day Safer-at-Home orders are set to expire.                                                                  Unlike other farmers, High Meadow Farms will not have a stand in Fort Atkinson or Madison to start the season.                                                                  “We are not going to be selling at the Fort Market this year,” Meg Kelly said. “At least not at this time. The market will be going on and I hope that it is successful, but I have decided to keep my exposure to the public as minimal as possible to stay healthy and make sure that those working here do as well.                                                                  “We have instead been offering an online Farmers Market right from the farm. I will continue to send out weekly availability lists to everyone on my market email list and they are able to order online and pick up at the farm on Friday or Saturday each week. We had our first sale last weekend and it went really well. People can choose a pick up time and we set their order out for them in our designated pick up area and there is very little interaction, sadly, with other people.                                                                  “This model of market is definitely different. Almost everyone who came last week wore a mask, as do I. Some seemed anxious about even leaving their car. Most just said ‘hello’, grabbed their loot and took off. There was clearly that social aspect missing and I look forward to the day that we can return to a more friendly market format, but for now, it is just nice to have a few moments to see people. I am happy to be able to offer veggies to people, especially those on our waiting list.”                                                                  Customers are asked to place orders by 10 the morning before Friday or Saturday pickups. They are asked to leave a message as to what time they will arrive at the farm so orders can be prepared accordingly.                                                                  “This year is something else and the food situation is not making anyone feel more at ease,” Kelly said. “We increased our membership by 40 members this year because this all happened early enough to make those changes, and we now have a waiting list of almost 60 people. It should be exciting, but it is instead a little frightening. I hope that we will be able to grow as much extra food as possible to feed hungry people. It does help that (my son) Matt and (his girlfriend) Joy are back this year as well as our awesome employees from the past two years.”                                                                  High Meadow Farm is located at N6967 South Lane, near Milford.

Researchers from China, Boston and Italy performed contact surveys in Wuhan, where the coronavirus was first detected, and Shanghai, China's largest city.                          They estimated that removing all interactions normally seen in schools for children up to 14 years old would lead to a reduction in the average daily number of new cases of about 42%, while reducing children's interactions to those typically seen during vacation periods could reduce new cases by 64%.                          "Overall, school-based closure policies are not sufficient to entirely prevent a Covid-19 outbreak, but they can impact disease dynamics, and hence hospital surge capacity," said the researchers.                          The paper states that children ages 0-14 are about a third as likely to be infected with coronavirus as adults, but experts told CNN that the research does not have sufficient data to be reliable.                          Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, said the paper is based on contact tracing and self-reported symptoms, so it does not record asymptomatic infections. It also only looks at specific locations in China, where there could be other factors that affect transmission, he said.                          A study from Shenzen, in southeastern China, published in the Lancet journal in April found that children had the same risk of contracting the coronavirus as the rest of the population but rarely developed severe symptoms.                          Another study posted on the German Research network Zoonotic Infectious Diseases in April suggested that children were less likely to be severely affected by Covid-19, but did not show whether their chances of being infected were lower. Experts told CNN the paper had not been peer reviewed and there were methodological issues that affected being able to make conclusions.                          Despite reservations on the available data, Clarke agreed that countries should be cautious in reopening schools.                          "None of this stuff is definitive, but it's building up a picture," said Clarke. "At this stage, when we just don't know enough about the susceptibility of children to picking up the virus and transmitting it, then we should err on the side of caution."                          Countries including China, Taiwan, Denmark and Israel have reopened schools and others are considering doing the same. The UK is reportedly weighing up reopening schools for younger children on June 1.                                          *[FT]: Financial Times

Football teams will be allowed to use five substitutes when play resumes after the coronavirus pandemic, the sport's law-making body announced on Friday. The International Football Association Board (IFAB) said in as statement that it had agreed to a proposal by world governing body FIFA for a temporary change to the rules "to protect player welfare".
 Teams face likely fixture congestion in a packed calendar as they attempt to make up for lost time when play can resume.
 The lay off is expected to have an impact on player fitness levels too.
 It also said that competitions which were using video assistant referee (VAR) would be allowed to drop it for the time being.
 The change will apply to competitions scheduled to be completed by 31 December of this year, although FIFA and IFAB left open the possibility that the period could be extended.
 While teams will be able to make five substitutions, "to avoid disruption to the game, each team will only have three opportunities to make substitutions" as well as at half time or before extra time.
 In competitions that allow an additional substitution in extra time, teams will have an additional substitution opportunity.
 The previous limit on outfield substitutes for top-level competitions has been three in regulation time.
 The IFAB said the change had been made "as matches may be played in a condensed period in different weather conditions, both of which could have impacts on player welfare."
 It added that "the decision on whether to apply this temporary amendment will remain at the discretion of each individual competition organiser."
 It said that, together with FIFA, it "will determine at a later stage whether this temporary amendment would need to be extended further.
 That means the measure could be maintained for the whole of the 2020-21 season and right through to the next European Championship, which was postponed by a year until June and July 2021 because of the pandemic.
 "If the measure is still in force, UEFA could then adopt it for the Euro," a source said.
 It remains to be seen if the measure could be left in place permanently, but doing so may play into the hands of the wealthiest clubs with the largest squads and greatest strength in depth.

TOWANDA BOROUGH — The Towanda Borough council appointed a new First Ward council person in their regularly scheduled meeting on Monday.

Some barbershops and hair and nail salons will reopen their doors on Friday, but others say they aren't ready for customers yet.
   
 Gov. Greg Abbott on Tuesday surprised salon owners by moving the expected opening up to Friday from May 18, saying a range of coronavirus data indicated the time was right. He changed the schedule again Thursday to allow them to open immediately.
   
 The businesses have been closed since March as part of coronavirus shelter-in- place orders in Austin and elsewhere across the state that called for nonessential businesses to temporarily shut their doors.
   
 Sport Clips, a 1,850-store chain based in Georgetown, is among those that will be cutting hair on Friday, said CEO Gordon Logan.
   
 The chain, which has already reopened locations in other states, has trained employees on sanitation practices and has created new protocols to keep staff and clients safe, he said.
   
 "We've been working on reopening policies and procedures since the shutdown in March," Logan said. "Our stylists are excited to get back to work and clients are chomping at the bit to get in."
   
 State guidelines recommend providing at least 6 feet of distance between work stations, checking the temperature of customers with a no-contact thermometer and then requiring them to wash hands upon entering the shop. Appointments should be scheduled to limit lines and walk-in clients should wait in their cars or outside.
   
 Gloves, if worn, must be removed and thrown out after each client, and hands must be washed or gloves replaced anytime an employee touches their face, nose, eyes, door, cellphone or credit card machine. Chairs and work stations must be sanitized after each customer.
   
 Sport Clips has supplied stores with touchless thermometers as well as masks, gloves, hand sanitizer and other safety supplies, Logan said.
   
 Disposable masks will be available for customers, who will check in online and be alerted when they can enter the store.
   
 "We'll have someone standing outside the store monitoring the traffic," Logan said. "Inside we'll be making sure we've got 6-feet social distancing."
   
 Despite getting the Friday go-ahead, some salons are delaying reopening until May 18, such as Austin-based Finley's Barbershop.
   
 "We're doing a lot of Zoom meetings, talking about how this process works, how to check someone in and check them out," said Darren Peterson, co-founder of the 14-store chain. "Even though salons and barber shops are required to follow sanitation procedures, it's much different to take a customer's temperature when they walk in or make sure they spray sanitizer on their hands."
   
 Finley's shops will not be providing some services including shaves, beard trims or nose waxing, he said.
   
 "We're going to concentrate on what guys need right now, which is haircuts," Peterson said. "We've been flooded by emails and calls saying 'I saw you can open on May 8, when can I come?' We appreciate that, but we're going to take our time and do it right."
   
 Among those that have not set a reopening date is Austin-based milk + honey, which operates six spas in Texas.
   
 "The announcement on Tuesday caught us by surprise," said Alissa Bayer, milk + honey founder. "I'm concerned that by reopening so soon it's going to set back all of the progress we have been making and we would have to go back to a more stringent shelter-in place and go through this whole painful process again."
   
 The owners of Birds Barbershop in Austin said they aren't quite yet ready to reopen but intend to do so soon.
   
 "Our plan at Birds Barbershop is to make sure we are the cleanest and safest place to get your haircut,"  said Michael Portman, who co-founded Birds with Jayson Rapaport. "To do that, we are working hard behind the scenes to make sure all our new safety protocols and protective supplies are ready. We anticipate reopening stronger than ever in mid-May."
   
 Kelli Meyer, a manager and hair stylist at Luca Salon in Austin's Rosedale neighborhood, said some of the salon's stylists will be returning to work Friday. Others, including Meyer, will wait until May 18, in an effort to secure adequate personal protective equipment, which Meyer says is lacking.
   
 "While the salon re-opening protocol has changed, the facts surrounding COVID-19 have not," Meyer said. "We cannot socially distance 6 feet apart. There isn't enough (personal protective equipment) for our nurses and doctors, much less hairdressers. What happens when we can't properly disinfect everything? Do we shut down again? What happens to us if we get sick? Most of us have no sick days or disability. None of this was thought through and puts everyone at risk."
   
 Annie Spilman, state director of the National Federation of Independent Business, a small business advocacy organization,  said allowing more businesses to begin to reopen "is going to help" ease some of the toll from the temporary closures. But she added: "Many of our small business members are concerned they won't make it unless they open soon. We will continue working with the governor's Strike Force to Open Texas to find a solution that allows more businesses to begin to reopen while keeping customers and employees safe."
   
 Some state Democrats said Abbott's latest order was premature, coming as several Texas counties are seeing a rise in coronavirus cases.
   
 State Rep. Chris Turner, D-Grand Prairie, tweeted that reopening hair and nail salons came too soon after other businesses were allowed to open, including malls, movie theaters and retail stores.
   
 "I thought we were waiting to see if the first round of re-opening caused COVID-19 spikes before making decisions on additional openings? It's been four days," Turner tweeted.
   
 Ray Perryman, a Waco economist, said there are about 5,200 hair and nail salon and related workers in the Austin area.
   
 "Under normal circumstances, the operation of this industry would generate about 2,400 additional (indirect) jobs," Perryman said. "That number is lower now because of the limitations of retail activity" and is unlikely to rebound immediately.
   
 Jack Kleinhenz, chief economist for the National Retail Federation, the world's largest retail trade association, said that as states begin to slowly reopen -- and assuming the coronavirus does not come back -- the economy should begin a process of gradual recovery.
   
 "Getting back to work or shopping in a pre-virus manner is difficult to predict at this time, with households likely to tiptoe back in rather than making an immediate return to the lives they experienced before," Kleinhenz said. "My overall impression is that the recovery will have fits and starts among states, regions and cities depending on the severity of the pandemic in their localities."

Currently unemployment insurance is experiencing unprecedented claim volume with over 300,000 weekly claims per week. This is 194% higher than the average number of weekly claims received during the first year of the Great Recession. Due to the uncertain future impacts of COVID-19, it is unknown if Wisconsin will continue to experience this high volume of claims and for how long this may occur. For this reason, it is difficult to project when or even if the UI Trust Fund may exhaust and Wisconsin will need to borrow from the federal government in order to pay benefits, as it did during the Great Recession.                                                                  The main driver of when or if Wisconsin will exhaust the UI Trust Fund depends primarily upon the level of weekly claims UI receives going forward. The three hypothetical scenarios range from a high of 255,000 payable claims per week to a low of 85,000 payable claims per week.                                                                   The analysis below is based on the average weekly benefit amount of $325; 85% of claims will paid from state Regular UI; and 94% of benefits will be charged to the UI Trust Fund.                                                                  The analysis does not include future employer-paid unemployment insurance tax revenue, which would be deposited into the Trust Fund, prolonging the viability of the fund beyond the scenarios.                                                                                                      *[FT]: Financial Times

Increasing consumption of linings in end use segments, especially the marine industry, drives the market. Countries such as China, Koreaand Japan dominate the global shipbuilding industry. Trade through marine ports accounts for the biggest volumetric share of the international trade. This positions the marine segment as one of the top consumers of linings. Moreover, the chemical industry has exhibited optimistic growth over the past few years. Wiith significant growth in the industrial sector in countries such as India and China, the demand for linings has been increasing. The global chemical industry generated a revenue of over US$3.5 Trillion in 2015 and is estimated to be valued at over US$ 5.05Trillion by the end of 2028. With this healthy growth in the chemical industry, the linings market is set to grow in tandem with it.Due to the rapidly growing demand from various end use industries, market entry is expected to be easierfor small players,owing to the fact that there is vast scope for manufacturers to differentiate their linings product offerings through the introduction of novel linings products.                                       *[FT]: Financial Times
