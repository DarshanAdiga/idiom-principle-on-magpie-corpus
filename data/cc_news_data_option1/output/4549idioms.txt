Even so, Latinos for Trump? Seriously? How often do the tormented fall in love with their tormentor? Have some self-respect.
 I realize Mexicans have very little in common with folks in Sweden, but this looks like our own bizarre version of Stockholm syndrome. And while Latinos aren't being held hostage by Trump, they are routinely insulted, demonized, and marginalized by him.
 All to score points with white voters who think the United States is being invaded by people of inferior stock. What an original idea that is. Benjamin Franklin said much the same thing about the German immigrants who streamed into Pennsylvania in the mid-1700s.
 Franklin had nothing to worry about. And neither do the white voters that form Trump's base. Latinos come in peace, except for those who have been here all along and welcomed your ancestors.

He began preparing a monthly meal for 60 people at Good Samaritan House in Carbondale almost two years ago that provided a well-rounded dinner, and breakfast for the next morning, to residents of Good Samaritan. Before COVID-19 struck, Beck used the kitchen at Grace United Methodist Church to prepare the meals along with volunteer groups from several other area churches. Many different faiths worked together happily to prepare, package, and deliver the meals to Good Samaritan House each month.

The Eagles outrebounded MC 34-20 and beat the Golden Bears 13-7 on the offensive glass. They forced 22 turnovers while committing only eight themselves, but coach Stephan Hamaker said, despite the impressive look to the win, there are areas for improvement.
 “I’m excited to be started at 2-0, but I’ve got a little different perspective than others,” he said. “I know the score was a little one-sided, but there are some little things that we aren’t doing well yet, not at all really. We’ve been working on it in practice, and we’re just not there yet, but I’ve said before, we definitely don’t want to be playing our best basketball at the beginning of the year.”

Bruce Springsteen is wrestling with death.
 You hear him as you float high above leafless trees dusted with snow. The scene, captured in creamy tones of black and white, is one of beauty almost unbearably elegiac, sacred in its stillness. Then he speaks, giving words to a truth all too familiar to anyone who has lived long enough to see skin grow loose and hair turn thin and gray.
 “Age,” he says. “Age brings perspective and the fine clarity one gets at midnight on the tracks, looking into the lights of an oncoming train. It dawns on you rather quickly, there’s only so much time left. Only so many star- filled nights, snowfalls, brisk fall afternoons, rainy midsummer days.”

Muncie Central had an advantage in height and heft over the Tigers but still only won the rebound battle 32-30.
 “We know we’re going to be smaller than everyone we play,” said VanBlair. “But we’re going to go after it and play hard for four quarters. It is so nice to go out there and play and know that everyone has each other's back.”
 A full 50% of the Alexandria rebounds came from seniors Maddy Schuyler and Rylee Pyle. The former is 5-foot-8 and the latter 5-6. Schuyler had eight rebounds and seven points, while Pyle had seven boards and was 9-of-10 from the free-throw line.
 Schuyler went down in the final seconds with an ankle injury and had to be helped off the floor.
 “I asked her if she would be ready for Tuesday (against Delta), and she said ‘Yes,’” said Hosier. “She’s a tough kid, and we’ll see if she can go. But we need her during the season more than we’ll need her Tuesday.”
 Central had a 23-point fourth quarter it threw at Alex and once had the lead down to 11. Junior Jasiah Scaife had a game-high 23 points and 16 rebounds for the Bearcats. She had seven of those points in the final eight minutes.
 Garynn Sims-Jones added 20 points, including 11 in the final period.
 “We had some foul trouble,” admitted Hosier. “But we made enough plays to hold on.”
 Some of that holding on involved hitting 23-of-30 from the free-throw line while Muncie was only 11-of-25.

And what better way to stand defiant in troubling times than to sit daintily and sip an overly caffeinated beverage? I know this may seem like a silly waste of time, but it’s no sillier than biting the faces off chocolate rabbits on Easter or stuffing presents into socks at Christmas. Granted, no one will be getting any time off of work to celebrate, so if you do find yourself punching the clock today then at least allow yourself a coffee break. And if your boss gives you any grief about being away from your desk for more than 15 minutes just inform them that you’re not being lazy, you’re actively trying to keep the holiday spirit going all year long.

Mentris Y. (Lee) Vick, 100, of East Windsor, beloved wife for 58 years of the late Joseph W. Vick, Sr., passed away peacefully on Saturday, October 31, 2020. Born in Hartford, daughter of the late Henry and Pearl (Richardson) Lee, Mentris was raised in Windsor and graduated from Windsor High School. She then proudly started her most important and rewarding career of raising her family. Later, she also enjoyed a position in the Distribution Center at Casual Corner. Mentris was a loving wife, mother, grandmother, great grandmother, sister, aunt, cousin, and dear friend. She will truly be missed by all who knew her. Her family will fondly remember her as a kind, loving, and giving woman whose family meant the world to her. She was also a very outspoken, opinionated, and clear thinking woman who was a true pioneer of her time, as she experienced many dramatic changes in the world over the last 100 years and always continued to have a positive attitude. Mentris always gave every experience she had a positive spin and passed that legacy on to her children. She taught them to always be kind, giving, and non-judgemental; to voice their opinion, live their best life and, most importantly, follow their dreams. There was no such thing as "I can't do it," and she encouraged them to be better and to make a difference in their lives and in the lives of others. Mentris was a God-fearing woman who loved and trusted in the Lord. She brought her children to church every week to give them the religious foundation they needed to make their own spiritual decisions. She was a faithful member of Faith Congregation Church in Hartford and a member of the Usher Board and a President of the Women's Club. Mentris would help anyone in need and her door was always open. She was also a Foster Mother, had an amazing and kind heart, and treated everyone as if they were her own children. Mentris loved poetry and was a gifted writer as well. She loved to sew and always made clothing and many costumes for her family. She was also an amazing baker and always made her pies, cakes, and chocolate chip cookies from scratch. She was a firm believer in "working smarter, not harder," so over the years as commercial baking products became available, she decided to use them, but always "doctored them up." She made everything with love. Mentris is survived by her children, Gary T. Vick and his wife Sandra of East Granby, Kenneth R. Vick of New York, NY, and Audrey J. Vick Dankwa of Windsor Locks; her grandchildren, Delores Waynette Norfleat and her husband Mario of Covington, GA, Corey Vick and his wife Keisha of Worcester, MA, Loren Andreotta of Windsor Locks, Kwame Dankwa of Portland, ME, Jamieson Vick of East Granby, Makenzie Vick of East Granby, Jayson Vick and his wife Alyse of Whitesboro, NY, Jalaika Shaw and her husband Erin Shaw of Minneapolis, MN; her granddaughter-in-law, Brenda Vick of Windsor, NC; several great grandchildren; and a host of other relatives and dear friends. Besides her husband and parents, she was predeceased by her son, Joseph William Vick, Jr.; her daughter, Joanne Andreotta; her step-daughter, Dorothy Anderson; her brothers, Herschel Lee and Audrey Lee; and her sisters, Maxine Hall and Rosalyn Scruse .

"While I may be the first woman in this office, I will not be the last," Harris said in her speech Saturday night.
 To win, Biden successfully unified different wings of the Democratic Party around their universal loathing of Trump, garnering support from progressive insurgents and establishment moderates alike.
 "The party came together to defeat Donald Trump," said Brian Lemek, a longtime progressive fundraiser and executive director of Brady PAC, which invested $6 million on 2020 candidates supporting gun violence prevention efforts and voting rights. "His main job right now, we all think, is to heal the nation."
 Biden senior adviser Ted Kaufman said the transition team will focus on the "nuts and bolts" of building the new administration in coming days. He said Biden plans to speak to legislative leaders and governors from both parties.
 Biden may not make top Cabinet choices for weeks. But he built his presidential run around bipartisanship and he has spent the days since Tuesday's election pledging to be a president for all Americans. That suggests he could be willing to appoint some Republicans to high-profile administration positions.
 Many former Republican officeholders broke with Trump to endorse Biden's campaign. His selection of some of them to join the new government could appease Senate Republicans, who may have to confirm many of Biden's choices for top jobs. The GOP could retain control of the chamber after two special elections in Georgia on Jan. 5.
 Still, too much across-the-aisle cooperation could draw the ire of progressives. Some already worry that uncooperative Senate Republicans could force Biden to scale back his ambitious campaign promises to expand access to health care and lead a post-pandemic economic recovery that relies on federal investment in green technology and jobs to help combat climate change.
 "I think there will be a huge misuse of the word 'unity' to imply that we need to water down the ideas that Joe Biden just campaigned on," said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. He said the country was more united around bold solutions to big problems than small-scale efforts to appease moderates in both parties.
 Biden's efforts at bipartisan reconciliation, meanwhile, could still be derailed by Trump's refusing to concede the presidential race. It wasn't clear if Biden and Trump would meet in coming days, as is the modern tradition.
 Biden campaign spokeswoman Symone Sanders said, "Donald Trump does not get to decide the winner of elections."
 "The people decide, voters in the country decide," Sanders said. "And voters have made their choice very clear."
 Some of the president's supporters used similar language to make the opposite argument.
 "The media do not get to determine who the president is. The people do," tweeted Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri. "When all lawful votes have been counted, recounts finished, and allegations of fraud addressed, we will know who the winner is."

Elizabeth "Betsy" Willard Van Beber   June 28, 1967 - November 3, 2020   Overland Park, Kansas - Betsy (Willard) Van Beber passed away on November 3, 2020 in Overland Park Ks. She was 53. Betsy came into this world on June 28, 1967 as Elizabeth Anne Willard, the daughter of James and Elizabeth "Boo" (Buffe) Willard. She was the third of five children and grew up in the Red Bridge area of south Kansas City, riding her bicycle everywhere. She graduated from Center High School, obtained a degree in Communications from UMKC and a Masters of Social Work from the University of Kansas. She was a member of the Chi Omega Sorority.   Betsy spent the early years of her professional life working as a therapist at Gillis School for Boys, making a difference in the lives of emotionally challenged children. She married Eric Van Beber in 1996. Not too long after, she gave birth to her treasured daughters, and began her true calling as a loving and devoted mother. Despite the day-to-day challenges of raising kids, Betsy, as a loving wife and mother, always managed to have a laugh or a smile and was quick to hand out the hugs and encouragement. The feelings of others were what really mattered. Betsy's legacy, and her greatest pride, were her strong, confident, and caring daughters.   Betsy was gentle and charming. Her love for her pets, especially her cats, knew no bounds. She fed any stray that wandered by. She was a voracious reader of novels and magazines. One of her favorite holidays was Halloween because she could interact with little ones and hand out candy. Trying to keep Betsy from children was like trying to keep bees from honey. It was why she was placed on this earth. Betsy's heart condition stood in absolute contrast to the emotional fullness and she brought to her life, and to all those around her. Most of all, she loved her family with a fierceness that belied her body.   Betsy would not want anyone to grieve her passing. Instead, she would want her memory to bring a smile to your face and her wit to make you laugh. Words are inadequate to describe her beauty—inside and out—and so we stop here.   Betsy was preceded in death by her mother, father, sister Kathryn and brother David. She is survived by her husband Eric; daughters Kathryn "Katie" and Mary "Mimi"; brothers Rob and Ted Willard; Uncle Greg and Aunt Beth Buffe; Aunt Chandra and Uncle Sam Kirby; and Aunt Anne Mitchell; nephews Hal, Jack, John and James; nieces Claire Caroline, Emma, Leah and Audrey. And last - but not least - her cats Luna, Socks and Boo Radley. In lieu of flowers, the family requests donations in her memory to Wayside Waifs.   Due to COVID restrictions, a private family service will be held with burial in Mount Moriah Cemetery. In lieu of flowers, the family suggests donations in Betsy's memory to Wayside Waifs.
