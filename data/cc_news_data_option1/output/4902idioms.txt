Doug Bargerstock has been a professional Santa Claus since retiring from teaching in 2015.
   
 He mainly does events and family photo shoots around the metro Detroit area, but this holiday season, the COVID-19 pandemic is forcing him and others donning the red suit to take a different approach to spreading holiday cheer.
   
 Now, in addition to the red suit, a white beard and a red hat, Bargerstock, depending on the family's request, is wearing a mask and sometimes a plastic face shield when posing for photos with children.
   
 For the little ones, the new, pandemic-focused additions to Santa's attire can be slightly jarring.
   
 "You get more skittish children, I suppose, especially if it's a first-time visit," Bargerstock said. "For a first or second-time visit, you walk in and you've got a mask on and mom wants to hand you over to this great, big, bearded guy with a red suit, you see that he's wearing a mask, it can be a little dark.
   
 "That could put a kid off to Santa Claus. I don't want to say scar them for life, but boy, something like that could hold true."
   
 Health precautions are being put in place across the U.S. at events with Santa Claus. Some events separate Santa from children by six-feet, often using plexiglas barriers to prevent children from running up to give St. Nick a hug.
   
 And even though Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading infectious disease expert, joked that Santa is "immune" to coronavirus, there is still concern for those putting on the suit and attending events, especially when many are in older age groups and are considered vulnerable to COVID-19.
   
 "Most of the (events) that I have gone to, they want the real Santa experience," Bargerstock said. "So it's hard to decide ... I'm no spring- chicken anymore, I'm a little long in the tooth. And I've said that I don't have any physical ailments, but still, I'm an older guy, so you've got to give it some thought before you go into it."
   
 Bargerstock said many of the events he's attended are outside, which is believed to have a lower risk for transmission of COVID-19 than indoor gatherings. However, families requesting his services for a personal photo shoot are less inclined for him to wear a mask.
   
 "The ones who go through photographers mostly want the regular Santa experience and they want to go without the mask," he said. "But it's always offered up. Whenever I've sat for one of these photographers, every one comes up says says 'Santa's got a mask.'"
   
 Bargerstock said the latest order from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services that prohibits many indoor gatherings has caused several planned events to be canceled. Still, he hopes he can offer some sense of normalcy to young children in a year that's been wracked by a global pandemic.
   
 "You just want there to be some normalcy," he said. "And this would be the time for it, this would be the time for some kind of normalcy. The closer we get to the holidays, the less normal things are being forced to become.
   
 "I feel bad for the children. Maybe it isn't even affecting them because they have been wearing the mask since March, but it affects me, it does affect me. It kind of breaks my heart a little bit to see them coming up with little masks. It's bothersome, but I just want this thing to be over. It's not yet. But we'll get through it, I hope, we'll get through it."

WSU coach Nick Rolovich expressed confidence the Cougars would be in the clear to play USC during his latest media availability. With as many as nine players in COVID-19 protocol, WSU had to cancel games against Stanford (Nov. 21) and Washington (Nov. 27) and the Cougars will have gone 22 days without a game when they arrive at the Coliseum Sunday. All nine players quarantining or isolating should be available for WSU, though it’s unclear if any additional athletes have entered the COVID-19 protocol since athletic director Pat Chun offered his most recent update early last week.
