In other states, Republican operatives and vocal supporters of Trump have worked to boost West's candidacy and secure his spot on the ballot. Critics contend West's last-minute run - and the apparent GOP support it's received - is a ploy to swipe votes from Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, especially in key swing states. Representatives for West have brushed aside that criticism.

Digital marketplaces have liberated consumers of many judgements. Instead of creeping around a drug store picking any anal bleach off the shelf and praying for a self-check-out lane, shoppers can now read online reviews and enjoy the privacy of their virtual carts. But some see at-home chemical bleach as an excessively time consuming measure, and like with many things, they want more immediate gratification.

Gary Vaynerchuk is hands down the No. 1 entrepreneur brand personality out there that many of us leaders should learn from. His transparency and authenticity are unparalleled in comparison to all other entrepreneur personalities out there. He documents the entire process from start to finish. This means he shows, acts and talks about both his losses and his wins. He shows no filter with his language nor the way he acts. He doesn't need to put up a front to anybody. He swears when he feels like it. He underdresses anywhere he goes all while still keeping it professional by giving his motivational speeches. By documenting almost every single interaction, meeting, speech and daily hustle, he never runs out of content to post throughout the entire social media spectrum. It's storytelling at its finest. - Fritz Colcol, ABN Circle

We have a few different methods of handling conflict. Before I share those, I will add that we have a very open feedback culture as it's something that is built right into the tool we've created. We're not afraid to share helpful, directed feedback with each other as we lead with good intent and know that we're all moving in the same direction. The first method we use is our one-on- one meetings. Our one-on-ones are an opportunity to exchange feedback between managers and direct reports and address any conflicts or disagreements. Beyond the one-on-one, we have skip-level meetings where our individual contributors meet with a manager's manager to discuss any issues and get a temperature check. Finally, we use our own feedback tool often to gather feedback from the entire team. - Erin Blaskie, Fellow.app

he broader benefits of the cloud are well known by now and most organisations have made significant progress on their cloud migration journeys. However, back-office applications, such as enterprise resource planning (ERP), have typically found themselves in the baggage train at the back of this march towards progress. The back-office's critical day-to-day functions, heavily customised nature, integration with other systems, and entrenched attitudes of, “if it ain’t broke don’t fix it” mean technology decision makers have often taken a risk averse approach to ERP in the cloud. Yet, our recent research into the benefits of cloud-based ERP shows the gains typically far outweigh any perceived risks and challenges. This webinar, and accompanying research, will establish to what extent fears around ERP cloud challenges are justified today, what the dominant hurdles are, and how best to overcome them. This will include: migration, integration, security, skills, customisability, cost, and vendor lock-in.

Just like other reservoirs, the trout have moved into deeper water. Fishing in the canyon by the dam has been fair to good for trout. Black leeches have been working for trout, but also have been very good for bass. Best time for bass seems to be from sunup to about 10:30 am and late evenings.
