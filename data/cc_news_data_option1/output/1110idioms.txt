Meanwhile, Hulu’s basic subscription only costs $6 a month, but that comes with ads that run during scheduled commercial breaks. If you want to watch Hulu ad-free, you’ll need to pay double, but if you can afford it, the higher tier is the way to go. Hulu seems to be adding more ads as time goes on, and individual ads are tied to specific programs. If you’re binge-watching a particular show, you’re going to see the same ads over and over, which is a very easy way to ruin your viewing experience.

 PANAMA CITY BEACH -- Bay County sheriff's deputies arrested three people and dispersed a group after they allegedly violated the state's pandemic crowd restrictions and the local alcohol on the beach ban on Wednesday.
   
 The Sheriff's Office arrested Claire Elizabeth Brewer, 20, of Missouri and Sierra Van-Olden, 20, of Missouri, for possession of an alcoholic beverage on the sandy beach. Leah Elledge, 22, of Missouri was arrested for disorderly conduct.
   
 All three were arrested after deputies encountered a house party in Panama City Beach that was spilling out onto the sandy beaches in large numbers -- in direct violation of Gov. Ron DeSantis' recent order banning crowds and the city's ordinance banning alcohol on the beach in March.
   
 According to a Thursday press release, a deputy patrolling along the shore heard loud music and encountered a large group of people on the sand around 2:30 p.m. Wednesday at a residence on Surf Drive near Beach Access 18. The large number of people at the house party and their disregard for law enforcement made it difficult to maneuver emergency vehicles around or through the crowd, the press release states.
   
 The number of people gathered was in direct violation of DeSantis' order that gatherings must now be limited to groups of 10, separated from each other by 6 feet, due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
   
 The crowd had been warned already by another deputy for the need to comply with the order and had spread out, but appeared disorganized and drinking alcoholic beverages, a violation of a local county ordinance banning alcohol on the sandy beaches in March.
   
 After Brewer and Van-Olden were arrested for possession of alcohol on the sandy beach, another deputy arrived to assist. The press release states that the crowd began yelling and arguing about the arrests. They were agitated and appeared intoxicated.
   
 Elledge allegedly began arguing loudly with the deputies and agitating the crowd and so was arrested for disorderly conduct.
   
 Sheriff Tommy Ford is putting additional resources on beach patrol to enforce all state and local laws, the press release added.

For the first time in the history of Fort Smith, the board of directors temporarily changed the definition of "present" for meetings. Directors will now have the option to call or video conference into the meeting in order to practice social distancing.
 As the meeting began Tuesday night, Mayor George McGill asked if there was anything the board wanted to add to the agenda. At-large Director Kevin Settle was the first to speak with a prepared ordinance from city administration.
 The ordinance proposed allowing city directors to call in via telephone or video conference in order to be present at the meeting. City Administrator Carl Geffken explained that, though the mayor, clerk, deputy administrator and himself would be in one location, they would not be in as close proximity to each other.
 The ordinance going into effect immediately allowed Ward 1 Director Keith Lau to call into the meeting and take part while self-quarantining.
 Lau entered self-quarantine after an employee came to work sick following a trip to Las Vegas. The director is not himself sick, but wanted to follow the CDC guidelines of social distancing and taking every precaution.
 This ordinance will be in effect through June 30, at which time the board will reassess an extension if necessary.
 There was no indication as to whether the city would limit the number of residents able to attend, but as noted at the beginning of every meeting, the meetings are telecast.
 The only item on the agenda that did not pass unanimously was the establishment of a temporary entertainment district.
 With a vote of six in favor and one opposed, the board approved the ordinance with the amendment that events could use a portion of the district rather than activating the whole district, even for small events.
 When explaining her vote in the negative, At-large director Robyn Dawson stated that she was in no way against holding events and even praised the success of the Steel Horse Rally without the ordinance.
 Dawson had heard several concerns from constituents and decided to show her support of these Fort Smith residents by voting no. She also pointed out that downtown has long been a family-friendly space and some residents are concerned that a temporary entertainment district might lead to a permanent one and change that dynamic.
 Other directors had questions regarding the district and how careful the city needed to be when issuing these permits.
 Settle agreed with the other directors and pointed out that the ordinance is a living document and can be amended as necessary if issues arise. "I'm hoping that, as the year progresses and a couple events happen, that we tweak it a little bit as we find issues if any arise," he said.
 A near miss of impact from the pandemic was Sanitation Director Kyle Foreman's request for the board to approve making funds available to pay half a salary for an education director for the department.
 Ward 3 Director Lavon Morton moved to table the item in order to keep funds available for relief to those impacted by COVID-19.
 Foreman expressed frustration at the potential delay and pointed out that Sebastian County Regional Solid Waste Management District (SCRSWMD) had already approved their half of the funding.
 "If we don't approve this position, the level of education and outreach that we provided last year will not happen this year," Foreman shared with the board.
 After discussion by the board, Foreman pointed out that he does not have a person in mind for the position and therefore the financial part would not take effect until later this year. Morton removed his motion to table and the board unanimously passed the item.
 In light of current events, the board postponed appointing various committee positions until their next meeting.

“These types of reactions are a normal way that the brain and body prepare for perceived threats, even if we are not in immediate danger,” Kolacz said. “Traumatic experiences prolong these brain and body responses after the threat has gone.”
 Taking the time to manage stress can reduce these problems, which can include insomnia, in the long run, according to Kolacz.
 MENTAL HEALTH CARE
 Self-quarantining can be stressful, and Cadwell, the psychologist, suggests focusing during the COVID-19 crisis on things that can be done — rather than what can’t be done. Taking a walk or talking to someone can ease feelings of social isolation and anxiety.
 The Indiana Family and Social Services Administration shares information from the Indiana Department of Health concerning the coronavirus, including a web page dedicated to mental health professionals.
 FSSA, along with the American Red Cross, will offer specialized Psychological First Aid webinars to mental health professionals in the coming weeks.
 The state health department recommends promoting education for patients, including handwashing hygiene and coronavirus information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
 The department cautions against misinformation spread on social media and suggests limiting exposure to the news, as “excess media exposure to coverage of stressful events can result in negative mental health outcomes.”
 Kolacz suggested checking the news on a fixed schedule or disabling notifications to avoid feeling overwhelmed.
 For mental health providers and Hoosiers alike, FSSA urges taking care of yourself by making sure your needs are met, maintaining a healthy diet, exercising and engaging in hobbies.
 “If you’re feeling stressed, if you’re not sure where to turn or you’re looking for resources, there should be no hesitation in reaching out,” Cadwell said.
 Centers like Four County operate 24/7 and can help Hoosiers navigate other potentially stressful processes, such as applying for unemployment benefits or transportation assistance.
 “People just need to know: pick up the phone. Don’t hesitate and ask somebody for help,” Cadwell said.

 CANTON--During its regular March meeting Monday, members of the Canton Union District 66 Board of Education were presented information about the current school closures due to the Coronavirus situation.
 Beginning Tuesday, Canton schools, along with all other schools in the state of Illinois, were closed at least until the end of the month.
 Updates will be made daily on the school's website, www.cantonusd.org/covid-19-school-closure-resource-page.html
 These will include daily public information from District Superintendent Rolf Sivertsen, a revised school calendar, resources for parents (health, food needs, at-home learning activities) and E-learning plans for the future in case the closure continues.
 These future plans have already been approved by the Regional Office of Education.
 Curriculum Director said these plans, which normally would have taken six to nine months to prepare, had been done over the weekend. He added the district was also working with U.S. Cellular and Comcast to provide internet access to all students.
 In addition, about 500 meals would be provided Tuesday, March 17, for students who needed food assistance. After finding out how much assistance was needed, the district would continue to distribute food over the next two weeks.
 Several administrators commented parents had been appreciative for the help.
 The board also heard from architect Bill Phillips on construction grants offered by the state.
 Phillips said grant applications would be taken in the late summer and early fall of 2020 and reviewed by the late spring of 2021. After conditional approval, each district would have two years to come up with the necessary matching funds.
 Phillips said studies were being done concerning adding on to Eastview Elementary School, resulting in having all elementary students attending the facility.
 Benefits to this plan included having all elementary students at one site, improving the uniformity of educational programs and class size and lowering costs for the district.
 Plans were still in the works and interviews with district personnel would be conducted, possibly in April.
 The board approved having Phillips proceed with the plans.

Fort Smith's work over the past several years to provide more outdoor exercise space, like the Greg Smith Riverfront Trail, as well as businesses that promote health and fitness for their employees, has led to a rare ranking as the "Fittest City in Arkansas."
 Insurify, an insurance quotes comparison site, on Wednesday recognized Fort Smith and other communities across the nation that "demonstrate exceptional dedication to the health and fitness of their residents" with the award.
 While it may seem misplaced because of the other rankings Fort Smith has received in the past which were associated with heart disease and strokes, it goes to show that the efforts of groups like Friends of Recreational Trails (FORT), Mercy Fort Smith, Baptist Health, the Arkansas Colleges of Health Education, the City of Fort Smith and the Fort Smith Central Business Improvement District have not gone unnoticed.
 Alexandra Conza, a data scientist and writer for Insurify, confirms that the quality and availability of public green spaces like trails and parks were a "significant determining factor" in identifying the fittest city in each state.
 "Fort Smith has done a truly commendable job on this front," Conza writes. "Congrats to Fort Smith on the efforts it has put into improving the quality of life for those who live there. It looks like it's paying off!"
 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, physical activity improves mental health and reduces the risk of chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Regular exercise also increases longevity and even improves productivity in the workforce, a news release from Inusurify notes.
 Elizabeth McClain, Ph.D., vice provost and vice president of Academic Affairs for Arkansas Colleges of Health Education in Fort Smith, said outdoor recreation opportunities around Fort Smith was one of the factors that drew her and her husband, Dr. Rance McClain, from Hattiesburg, Miss., last year. Rance McClain is the dean of the Arkansas College of Osteopathic Medicine.
 "One of the things that drew my husband and myself to Fort Smith was all of the opportunities to spend outdoors getting physically fit," Elizabeth McClain wrote in an email. "As an avid runner I have been thrilled to discover trails in Chaffee Crossing, the river trail downtown, Lake Fort Smith and the beautiful parks in our city. There are multiple opportunities in Fort Smith, whether walking, running, using biking trails, utilizing the dog parks or community parks where we can take time for ourselves, a few moments in our busy schedules for mindful physical and psychological wellness."
 She went on to explain that the medical college students who are not from this area are also falling in love with the community and the Arkansas weather that makes it possible to be outside almost year-round.
 "We know there is a direct correlation to exercise and an active body and healthy mental wellness," Elizabeth McClain added. "Congratulations to Fort Smith, and may we all strive to define and promote wellness in health and fitness."
 The presence and accessibility of public parks, nature reserves and other green spaces in communities are indispensable for the health and well-being of their citizens, Insurify states.
 In light of warmer weather being right around the corner, Insurify's data scientists wanted to take the opportunity to recognize the cities and communities across America that have demonstrated "exceptional dedication to their residents' fitness and well-being."
 The analysis looks at the creation and maintenance of publicly accessible recreation areas, parks and other green spaces. Insurify explains they also took a look at the work of residents in careers relating to healthy eating choices and fitness.
 Selection process
 Referring to their database of over 2 million insurance applications, Insurify's data scientists identified cities with the highest proportion of residents in careers that demand significant physical activity, or those that promote health and fitness (from park rangers, fitness club managers and dieticians to dancers and choreographers).
 Then, they compiled data from Niche on the cities with the highest ranking for outdoor activities, which were ranked based on several factors, including the rate of adults reporting leisure-time physical activity, and access to recreational goods rentals. Cities with the highest proportion of residents living within a 10-minute walk to a park were also identified, using data from the Trust for Public Land Index.
 Gyms and other health centers were excluded from the study. While they are a valuable source of exercise for some, Insurify notes, they can be "unaffordable to lower-income citizens." Moreover, significantly less than half of those with a gym membership exercise regularly, the news release adds.

For the mass-use of testing kits, they must be both cheaper and widely available. For this to happen, there is no doubt that the private sector will have to be involved. It is extremely unlikely that the state sector will be able to produce what is required purely on its own. Yet it has been reported that private companies that wish to become part of this production process of test kits are facing major hurdles in getting the required approvals. Surely this should not be an additional hurdle at this point in time? India's usual and problematic approach to the ease of doing business cannot be permitted to hold up matters of such supreme national and humanitarian importance. It appears that several companies have run from pillar to post, seeking validation of their test kits, but only the National Institute of Virology, or NIV, is capable of providing the necessary validation -- and the NIV appears to be overrun at the moment. The immediate task for the health authorities must be to designate alternative reputable sources for this necessary validation and get kits out to where they are needed. If necessary, the government must agree to purchase them in bulk at a fair price -- or subsidise their purchase by private testing labs in such a way that anyone who wishes to be tested can be tested. The Indian Council of Medical Research had suggested free testing for novel coronavirus, but this will naturally lead to rationing or refusal by the private sector in the absence of government subsidies.

"Movable type" is a term that refers to the technology used to print symbols or letters on paper. In 1450, German inventor Johannes Gutenberg created a movable-type machine called the printing press that led to the mass production of books. He is rightfully regarded as an influential innovator. To be thorough in our historical understanding, though, we must note that Chinese inventor Bi Sheng printed paper books with comparable machinery beginning in 1040. I bring this to your attention as an example of how to correct old stories that are only partially true. This can be a rewarding activity as you reconfigure your own past in the coming weeks.

CANTON--During its regular March meeting Monday, members of the Canton Union District 66 Board of Education were presented information about the current school closures due to the Coronavirus situation.
 Beginning Tuesday, Canton schools, along with all other schools in the state of Illinois, were closed at least until the end of the month.
 Updates will be made daily on the school's website, www.cantonusd.org/covid-19-school-closure-resource-page.html
 These will include daily public information from District Superintendent Rolf Sivertsen, a revised school calendar, resources for parents (health, food needs, at-home learning activities) and E-learning plans for the future in case the closure continues.
 These future plans have already been approved by the Regional Office of Education.
 Curriculum Director said these plans, which normally would have taken six to nine months to prepare, had been done over the weekend. He added the district was also working with U.S. Cellular and Comcast to provide internet access to all students.
 In addition, about 500 meals would be provided Tuesday, March 17, for students who needed food assistance. After finding out how much assistance was needed, the district would continue to distribute food over the next two weeks.
 Several administrators commented parents had been appreciative for the help.
 The board also heard from architect Bill Phillips on construction grants offered by the state.
 Phillips said grant applications would be taken in the late summer and early fall of 2020 and reviewed by the late spring of 2021. After conditional approval, each district would have two years to come up with the necessary matching funds.
 Phillips said studies were being done concerning adding on to Eastview Elementary School, resulting in having all elementary students attending the facility.
 Benefits to this plan included having all elementary students at one site, improving the uniformity of educational programs and class size and lowering costs for the district.
 Plans were still in the works and interviews with district personnel would be conducted, possibly in April.
 The board approved having Phillips proceed with the plans.

Technical chart claims that California Resources Corporation (CRC) would settle between $2.86/share to $3.17/share level. However, if the stock price goes below the $2.35 mark, then the market for California Resources Corporation becomes much weaker. If that happens, the stock price might even plunge as low as $2.15 for its downside target. The stock is currently in the red zone of MACD, with the indicator reading -0.29. Traders are always alerted for the move of a stock above or below the zero line due to the fact that the reading is an indicator of the position of the short-term average relative to the long-term average. If the MACD is above the zero line, then the short-term average relative is above that of the long-term average, thus implying an upward momentum. Vice versa is the case if the MACD is below the zero line.

Rory McIlroy put a positive spin on the current upheaval in the golf calendar, saying that playing the Masters in the fall "would be pretty cool."
 Augusta National chairman Fred Ridley announced last week that the 2020 tournament scheduled for April 9-12 had been postponed due to the coronavirus outbreak, citing October as a possible target date.
 "It gives us some room for maneuvering, depending on what happens over the next few weeks," McIlroy told SiriusXM PGA Tour Radio on Thursday. "A Masters in the fall, October time, I think it would be pretty cool. It would be a very different look than what you usually see at Augusta."
 McIlroy, 30, is a four-time major winner, but is still looking for his first victory at the Masters. His best finish was fourth place in 2015.
 "I think it's definitely a possibility if they want to get the 2020 Masters in, I think that could definitely be a possibility. I'm sure they can make it happen if they want it to happen," McIlroy said.
 "I like to think that we can get a handle on this over the next sort of couple of months, and things can return to some sort of normality. But I don't think anyone knows, really."

Meya, honey, I feel your pain. No, really. Been there, done that. But there are important life lessons to be learned here. First--and dear to my heart--is this: Eat dessert first! It makes no sense to me that dessert comes at the end of a meal. You might be too full to eat it. You might choke on a fish bone or wad of tofu or something before you get there. Eat it first. You'll never be sorry. If your parents don't want you to eat it first, throw a tantrum. They'll give in.
