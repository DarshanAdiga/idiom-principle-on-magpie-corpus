Our first stop is the market in Alexandria. Behind a stall with carrots and celery, Estera wears white rubber gloves. She will turn 60 next month and come rain or shine or virus, she comes to the market to sell her vegetables.      Estera takes some precautions, like using disinfectant and wearing gloves, but her ease of mind comes from the fact that there is no case of coronavirus in Alexandria. No confirmed case anyway, as Romania has been slow at testing.      It felt unnatural doing documentary photography without getting close to people; to listen to their stories while keeping them at a safe distance. But I knew that I could not get closer than two metres, that I had to stay away from crowded places, that I could not touch any surfaces and that I had to wash my hands thoroughly as soon as I returned to the motorhome.

In the last two and a half weeks we have been following the Governor's request to stay home. We only leave for food shopping and the essentials that we can't get on line, and to take evening walks around the block on our village's abandoned roads. We are grateful for having a house, a yard, a vegetable garden, and a chicken coop. Our five year-old son, Asher, has not been in school the past three weeks so we came up with a makeshift homeschool program for him. My partner is in charge of academics and I am the arts and crafts czar. Grandma from Florida, and via Facetime, is doing a great job at teaching him how to read and write. Our son loves to help in the kitchen, making pancakes, fritters, smoothies and more, though he is way too fast when mixing things and manges to sprinkle fine flour dust all over the place. When the sun is out we try to spend as much time outside as possible. We also enjoy making bonfires in the evenings, which gives me an excuse to improve my skills in splitting billets and sharpening axes and mauls.

 These are all programmable organisms called xenobots, the creation of which was revealed in a scientific paper in January.

Germany's 10-year bond yields rose to their highest in just over a week on Monday, reflecting a slightly brighter tone in world markets as the death toll from the coronavirus slowed across major European countries including France and Italy.
 But the selloff was modest, reflecting heightened uncertainty triggered by the virus outbreak and the significant damage being inflicted on the economy. Italy reported its lowest daily COVID-19 death toll for more than two weeks on Sunday, while France's daily death count also fell in the past 24 hours.
 In Spain, which has the second-highest coronavirus death toll in the world after Italy, the pace of deaths slowed again on Monday. "With aggressive policies of social distancing and testing (and good healthcare systems), there is light at the end of the tunnel," said Erik Nielsen, group chief economist at UniCredit, said in a note.
 "But now the bad news: it's still a long tunnel." Analysts note that the United States and Britain are still yet to see a peak in terms of coronavirus cases, while countries in Asia that had successfully managed to control the first stage of the virus outbreak are now battling a second wave.
 The toll the lockdowns will have on economic growth globally, alongside massive central bank easing, suggested bond yields would remain low for some time, they said. DEBT PURCHASES
 The European Central Bank bought a record 34 billion euros of debt last week in its bid to put a lid on borrowing costs. Italian bond accounted for 35% of the ECB's public sector bond purchases in March, well above the amount indicated by the country's shareholding in the bank. Bonds from Germany, the bloc's largest economy, accounted for only 6%.
 On the data front, orders for German-made goods dropped 1.4% in February, as a sharp fall in orders from abroad hinted at the likely impact of the coronavirus on the exporting powerhouse's economic prospects. Investor morale in the euro zone, meanwhile, fell to an all-time low in April, the Sentix survey showed.
 Germany's benchmark 10-year bond yield rose to as high as -0.39%, its highest in just over a week, but far below recent 10-month highs at -0.14%. It was up 2 basis points in late trade at -0.42%. Italian bond yields were down 4 basis points in late trade at 1.51%, in line with gains in risk assets such as stocks. They had risen in earlier trade, with analysts citing likely unease ahead of a Eurogroup conference on Tuesday.
 Euro zone finance ministers should have an open discussion on so-called 'coronabonds' as a tool to combat the economic damage, their chairman Mario Centeno said at the weekend. "While virus hopes support risk sentiment, the periphery should be held back by still low odds for coronabonds and ratings already start weakening," said Commerzbank rates strategist Rainer Guntermann.
 In primary issuance, Ireland and Cyprus hired banks for bond sales expected imminently.

Berlin will guarantee 100 per cent of loans made by banks to small- and medium-sized firms, ministers said Monday, in an extension to the 1.1-trillion-euro coronavirus crisis package in Europe's top economy. "These speedy loans should make sure that middle-sized companies have liquidity quickly, without taxpayers losing too much money," Finance Minister Olaf Scholz told reporters in the German capital.
 The federal government will stand fully behind 500,000 euros (USD 540,000) of lending to companies with up to 50 employees and 800,000 euros for larger ones up to 250 workers. Monday's moves ups the guarantee level from a previous 80 percent for large firms or 90 percent for smaller ones, levels that were still causing banks to think twice about granting loans.
 Companies this size "typically have credit needs in small amounts, but that have to be paid very quickly," Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said. The government is "very sure that there's little likelihood of companies failing to repay," Scholz added.
 Berlin's economic aid so far totals over 1.1 trillion euros, the finance ministry said in an answer to an opposition parliamentary question seen by AFP Monday. Ministers have agreed a 600-billion-euro "economic stabilisation fund" offering 400 billion euros of guarantees for companies' debts, 100 billion to lend directly to or buy stakes in troubled firms, and 100 billion euros to fund state investment bank KfW.
 Meanwhile the amount of company borrowing KfW can guarantee has been boosted by 357 billion euros, for a total of 822 billion. To keep their liquidity flowing, companies will also be able to delay tax payments.
 Berlin says it will offer 50 billion euros of support for small and one-man- band companies, like photographers, musicians or carers. Depending on the number of employees, individual companies will receive up to 15,000 euros each to keep the lights on over a period of three months.
 Meanwhile freelancers applying for unemployment benefit will not be forced to seek new work. Germany has also eased access to a programme that tops up workers' pay with government cash when their hours are slashed. The scheme is widely credited with saving large numbers of jobs during the financial crisis of 2008-9.

Most modern AI research focuses on simulated minds inspired by organic brains: Neural networks that can beat any human at strategy games, or algorithms that can control predesigned, occasionally terrifying robot bodies. But a smaller community of researchers, including Kriegman and Bongard, let their simulated robots evolve simple bodies and minds in tandem.
 Of course, Sims’ creatures never left their virtual homes. “There was one TV channel that built one just to demonstrate,” he said. But that model was just a blocky replica, not a moving robot.
 In 2000, virtual creatures took a halting first step into the real world when Lipson, then at Brandeis, and his colleague Jordan Pollock, a roboticist, connected an algorithm that could evolve its own simple machines to a 3D printer that could make the machines out of plastic.
 Still, Kriegman and Bongard doubted that some of their own designs could ever emerge out of a computer. Then they started working on a project for DARPA, the futuristic research wing of the U.S. Department of Defense, with Blackiston and Michael Levin, a biologist who directs the Allen Discovery Center at Tufts.

And now it's time to consider the unimaginable, at least when it comes to fun and games as we once knew them.
 That means no college football this fall. No Super Bowl next February.
 No sports at all as long as the new coronavirus keeps killing people across the country.
 Presumably, the commissioners of this country's major sports leagues already know that. They understand the kind of things — immediate widespread testing tops the list — that would have to happen to allow play to begin again.
 If not, a brief review of what the chief medical officer of the NFL told Barry Wilner of The Associated Press is in order.
 Read between the lines — actually, just read the lines — and the prospects of an NFL season later this year seem bleak, no matter how much the president of the United States would like to see sports come back quickly.
 "We have got to get a much better handle on the actual spread of this virus and how many new cases there are," said Dr. Allen Sills, a neurosurgeon who has been with the NFL since 2017. "How it is transmitted and how we can mitigate it. We have to get to the point that when someone is tested as positive to the virus that does not mean an immediate quarantine. If that is the case, you can't think about opening up a team sport."
 That is not how President Donald Trump sees it. He convened a conference call of major sports leaders on Saturday to give them a pep talk on sports coming back and indicated he would like to see it happen by September which, not coincidentally, is the scheduled start of the NFL season.
 "I want fans back in the arenas," Trump said later in a briefing at the White House. "I think it's ... whenever we're ready. As soon as we can, obviously. And the fans want to be back, too. They want to see basketball and baseball and football and hockey. They want to see their sports."
 On that, most everyone can agree, no matter their political persuasion. Sports offers a pleasant diversion in ordinary life, and it becomes even more important during a time of crisis.
 It's why baseball continued during World War II. It's why the NFL played two days after President John F. Kennedy was assassinated and why both Major League Baseball and the NFL rushed to get back on the field in the wake of the terrorist attacks of 9/11.
 The new coronavirus, though, is as sneaky as it is deadly. Even experts have a hard time figuring out the different ways it spreads and how to protect against it.

The CyberPower CP425SLG features eight standard power outlets. Four of them have basic power surge protection. The other four protect against power surges _and_ work with the uninterruptible power supply (UPS) battery.
 The basic idea with a UPS is that it offers enough power to safely shut down your gear when the power goes out. This particular UPS supports up to 255 Watts of power, with up to two minutes of runtime under full load or seven minutes under half load.
 This UPS has enough juice to support a standard home computer that’s handling tasks like editing a spreadsheet, document, or photo. If you get into anything much heavier like gaming or video editing–basically anything with a beefy graphics card under load–this UPS won’t fit the bill.
 It’s also a solid choice for the living room, or for laptops without a trustworthy battery.

But, in other ways, it does all come full circle. Some of that game's stars, players like Wynalda, Agoos, Harkes and Etcheverry, went on to become legends. Some of the game's coaches, Arena and then-assistant Bob Bradley, went on to become icons of the American game. In the stands that day, taking in MLS' first-ever match, was a 13-year-old Chris Wondolowski, who would go on to become the league's all-time leading scorer and a San Jose icon.

There came a time eventually when I found Jen again and that question asked me if I wanted to be with her and I saw the answer was still yes. That was a very nice moment, but the question continued on as ever, undeterred by what I thought might answer it once and for all. The idea of winners and losers is suicidal in a way; it’s an attempt to answer the question in some final way so that I need to never feel the discomfort, however brief, of moving within the lie of the inauthentic life. But that discomfort is only calling me back, back to the truth of love, the heartbeat you cannot lose, only ignore.

The United States on Monday warned China not to take advantage of the coronavirus pandemic to exert itself in the South China Sea after Vietnam said Beijing sank a trawler. Amid the global focus on fighting COVID-19, China has ramped up self-described research stations and landed special military aircraft in the dispute-rife sea, according to the State Department. We call on the PRC to remain focused on supporting international efforts to combat the global pandemic, and to stop exploiting the distraction or vulnerability of other states to expand its unlawful claims in the South China Sea, State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said in a statement. Vietnam said last week that it lodged a protest with Beijing after the Chinese Coast Guard hindered, rammed and sunk a Vietnamese boat with eight fishermen on board near the Paracel Islands. Vietnam -- which, like China and Taiwan, claims sovereignty over the Paracel Islands -- called in a foreign ministry statement for Beijing to compensate the fishermen, strictly discipline the officers responsible and prevent similar occurrences in the future. The United States said it was seriously concerned about the episode. This incident is the latest in a long string of PRC actions to assert unlawful maritime claims and disadvantage its Southeast Asian neighbors in the South China Sea, Ortagus said. The United States, which has a growing relationship with Vietnam, has challenged China's claims in the South China Sea -- one of the world's busiest waterways and also home to bountiful energy reserves. China last month accused the United States of a provocative act after saying that the USS McCampbell missile destroyer sailed near the Paracel Islands without Beijing's permission. Tensions have risen sharply in recent years between China and the United States, which has also alleged that Beijing has not promptly controlled SARS-CoV-2, the virus that has now infected more than one million people around the world.

The Open Meetings Act enforces the right of Michigan residents to know what takes place when public bodies at every single level of government convene. The decisions, discussions and deliberations that take place cannot legally happen without at least giving members of the public the opportunity to chime in.
 For public bodies, the act serves as a set of requirements for what they can and cannot do, in what's often referred to as a "sunshine" or transparency law.
 But there are varying levels of transparency in different government organizations. Some larger public bodies find that being transparent has more benefits than not.
 Shannon Felgner, communications manager for Ottawa County, said that operating with an air of trust enables the county to have a better relationship with its residents.
 "The most important thing that we as a county really need to sell to our residents, for lack of a better word, is trust," she said. "If our residents have trust in us, then that's everything."
 The OMA sets basic guidelines for informing citizens of where and when meetings will take place -- but doesn't necessarily require governments to detail what exactly is going on during a meeting.
 In the greater Holland area, some government units post meeting details online, along with other resources like meeting agendas, packets and ordinances.
 "We find it helpful, not only for the township board, but for the residents who attend the meetings and those who can attend the meetings to be as informed as they can about the different items going before their elected officials," said Saugatuck Township Manager Griffin Graham.
 Still, the amount of information available varies by municipality. Some post entire recordings of meetings on YouTube, while others don't post more than the basic agenda.
 Several communities, including the city of Holland, city of Douglas and Saugatuck Township, livestream and record all of their regular meetings.
 In the rare occasion when residents were explicitly encouraged to stay home and not attend meetings, live-streaming became a useful tool. In light of the COVID-19, or novel coronavirus outbreak, government orders mandated that people don't go out in public.
 Gov. Gretchen Whitmer issued a bevy of executive orders to mitigate the spread of disease, including one allowing for public bodies to meet virtually. The order allowed boards to meet without risking their constituents -- or themselves -- to exposure of COVID-19.
 Ottawa County Board of Commissioners Chair Roger Bergman said it would be likely the board takes advantage of the executive order.
 "We are considering it, we haven't made a final decision yet," he said. "A lot of it will depend on what happens with the virus. On its current trajectory, we would have to have our meetings that way to make sure that the public could have access."
 Graham mentioned that, generally, residents who seek out information from Saugatuck Township are able to receive it. But being transparent as a public body does not come without obstacles. Smaller governments, Graham said, can struggle with dedicating resources to transparency.
 "When you're a small township, (you) have limited resources and limited capacity to really do anything," he said. "And when you're spending time sharing information and making different materials available, that time can't be spent on other things."
 Still, Graham said, being transparent allows for a better relationship with residents.
 "It's definitely our goal as a local government," he said. "We pride ourselves on being responsive and helpful to our residents."
 Felgner added that consistently communicating effectively with residents allows a local government to operate efficiently during times of crisis. When residents know what to expect from a county, it's easier to combat misinformation and frustrations.
 "We tried to let people know the real information and really work to try to get (communication) ambassadors out there for us to share that correct information," she said.
 While a smaller municipality like Saugatuck Township may struggle with resources, Felgner said county governments often struggle with reaching their residents.
 "When it comes to county government, there tends to be a pretty good deal of apathy … there's not much involvement by residents. And so, just trying to get information out can be challenging because of that. It falls, sometimes, upon deaf ears."
 But efforts to increase government transparency don't always materialize. While Ottawa County makes its meeting agendas, minutes, packets and contact information for its elected officials readily available on its website, the county has struggled to push through other transparency measures.
 Earlier in 2020, an effort to have Ottawa County Board of Commissioners meetings recorded and uploaded to the county website was shot down in committee, after some commissioners said the estimated $16,000 cost over 10 years was unnecessary.
 Just a few weeks later, when Ottawa County residents urged the board to reconsider the matter, all but one county commissioner failed to motion for reconsideration.
 Graham believes baseline transparency measures, like posting meeting materials online, go a long way in helping residents understand their governments.
 "With anything that goes before an elected board, they're making policy decisions, they're making value based decisions," he said. "But by showing the information that they're using to make those decisions, hopefully it makes it easier for folks to understand how they come to conclusions they do."

Many states and cities with shelter-in-place orders restricting people from unnecessary trips and travel make exceptions for exercise and dog-walking, placing them in the essential for health and safety category. But it’s important to know where to go — and how to behave when you are there.
 “You just have to be rigorous about following the 6-feet distancing rule,” Harris said.
 That’s easier said than done.
 Some parks and hike-and-bike paths have grown so crowded that officials are urging people to stay away. In other cases, they’ve closed them altogether. Last week, Los Angeles County temporarily shut down its hiking trails and beaches after people kept breaking the 6-feet safe distancing recommendations. In Georgia, the governor has asked state wildlife officers to patrol and break up gatherings of 10 or more at parks and campgrounds and near lakes and rivers.
 “Err on the side of caution,” said Russell Pate, professor in the department of exercise at the University of South Carolina. “We do not yet have evidence on the risk of transmission of the virus in outdoor recreational settings, but I’d still steer away from trails and byways that seem crowded.”
 Harris, who lives in Seattle, said he’s been seeking out the road less traveled in recent weeks and walking off trail when the main path is filled with people.
 “A practical tip is to wear older shoes or boots that you don’t mind getting a bit of mud on during this rainy, soggy time of year,” he said.
 For urban dwellers, walking or jogging on sidewalks might be the best bet, but it poses its own challenges, Harris said.
 “If you see your neighbors and you’re tempted to stop and talk, that’s fine. But be courteous to others using the sidewalk. Take your conversation to a place where you can maintain a 6-foot distance.”
