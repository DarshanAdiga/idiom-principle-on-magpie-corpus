"He was just very honest," Garoppolo said. "Really never beat around the bush. He's very black and white with everything they did. That's kind of how I am. I really appreciate that from him. Whether it was my first day there or when I got traded, he always shot me straight and I think just when you're talking about just man to man, that's all you could really ask for at the end of the day."

Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden spent three days off the campaign trail, gearing up for tonight’s debate. A Biden adviser said the former vice president held mock debates, running through scenarios where the President continues his interruptions – even if they might not be heard by voters over the television. Biden expects the President to launch personal attacks on his family once again – a strategy that Biden’s advisers believes backfires on the president. Biden allies have said they don’t expect the former vice president to try to turn the tables on President Trump and his family, with Sen. Chris Coons telling CNN he doesn’t think Biden will “take the bait.” Instead Biden’s advisers and allies say he plans to turn this back to the issues impacting American families – Covid-19 and the economy, and Biden’s guests tonight reflect that push. The former vice president has invited Zweli and Leonardo Williams of Durham, North Carolina, whose small business has been impacted by the coronavirus pandemic – the types of voters Biden hopes to speak to tonight as he makes his closing case in the waning days of the election.

"Determining whether the labor market is improving or deteriorating has been more difficult in recent weeks because a reduction in the number of auto-plant layoffs typical at this point of the year has thrown the Labor Department's seasonal adjustment process out of line.
