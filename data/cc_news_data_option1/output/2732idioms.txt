In West Virginia, 90.6 percent of fire departments are volunteer and another 4.9 percent are mostly volunteer, compared to the national average of 70.5 percent volunteer departments and 16 percent mostly volunteer, according to the National Fire Department Registry.
 Harrison County has a mixture of paid, combination and completely volunteer fire departments, but most are strictly volunteer-based.
 Many people may take for granted the fact that the individual who shows up to help is not getting paid for that service, said Lori Dunn, president of the Spelter Volunteer Fire Department.
 “You dial 911 because you need help, and here in Spelter, if you dial 911, somebody’s going to come help you. That’s not just in Spelter. That’s in Shinnston, that’s in Nutter Fort, that’s in Lumberport — that’s what they do,” Dunn said. “I don’t think people give credit to the volunteers. During this pandemic, it’s all hands on deck and anyone you can get is beneficial, but even outside of the pandemic, these guys and ladies volunteer their time. They don’t get paid for it. … They don’t get anything. Volunteers volunteer their time out of the goodness of their heart and a lot of people don’t realize that.”
 The volunteer firefighters are doing this work despite the possibility that they could be exposed to the novel coronavirus, she said.
 West Milford Volunteer Fire Chief and county Fire Chiefs Association President John Elko said his department has fared well so far in avoiding illness, but it is a constant concern for the small department.
 “That’s the only worry that I have. We’re a small department of eight to 10 people. If you get somebody infected, you take out two or three or four or five, yes, at that point, it creates problems,” he said. “At this point, we seem to be doing OK, but that could all change tomorrow.”
 Another challenge early on was securing personal protective equipment.
 At the onset of the pandemic, departments scrambled to procure N95 masks, gloves, gowns and other gear to protect firefighters and the public.
 “We incurred a little extra expense initially just ramping up a little bit of supplies, some extra PPE,” said Shinnston Fire Chief Dylan Oliveto. “A lot of the things we needed, such as face masks and gowns, weren’t readily available, so fortunately the county had stepped in, along with the state resources to get us some of that. … At this point, we have enough to stay self- sustained for a short amount of time.”
 Volunteer departments in Harrison County receive funding from the county and state, but fundraising plays a big part, too, according to fire officials.
 At West Milford, fundraising is about 20-25% of the department’s budget, according to Elko.
 “Most of our fundraising involves drawing people in, whether it be a Bingo, a dinner, or things like that. At this point, all of that has ceased,” he said.
 Despite this, Elko said the department is “in pretty good shape.”
 “I’m not saying we’re the greatest financially, but I think we can weather the storm,” he said.

Existe un documento llamado estrategia regional de desarrollo 2012—2020, que no dice nada respecto de dejar establecida la ruta para alcanzar el desarrollo económico, por lo que surge la interrogante ¿qué beneficios trajo a la región?

Fans have dreamed this final chapter for years now, but rumors swirled in earnest about them last week. Information surfaced on social media suggesting _Haikyuu_ would be getting a long chapter with color spread at the end of July. This last-minute news may seem simple enough, but such an act closed out two other manga this year.


  0comments


  After all, _The Promised Neverland_ and _Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba_ had to deal with such news earlier in the year. Fans were dismayed when both manga informed fans they would be closing shop. _Demon Slayer_ was especially surprising given how popular the manga has become in light of its anime. Now, _Haikyuu_ will join the pair, and fans are going to shed a tear or twelve when they reach the manga's final page.
