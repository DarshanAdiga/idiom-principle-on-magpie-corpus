Finally, the Super Bowl might be fun again. No more scowling Bill Belichick, angry as always under his hoodie. No more sly smiles and phony platitudes from Tom Brady. No talk about Spygate; no worries about deflated footballs. And no more speculation about just what New England owner Robert Kraft might be up to. For the first time in four years, the Patriots will be sitting at home when the NFL championship is decided. And, really, on the 100th anniversary of the NFL, that should be reason enough to celebrate. They are already excited at sports books around the country, where hundreds of millions of dollars will exchange hands Super Bowl Sunday. They should be excited at Fox network headquarters, too, for a Super Bowl matchup that is really Super this year. Pick a winner if you can. But sports fans across America — with the exception of a little slice of the Northeast — are already winners before the Kansas City Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers even arrive in Miami. “I know a lot of people are happy to not see the Patriots in the game,” said Jay Kornegay, who runs the Westgate Las Vegas Superbook. “Patriot fatigue won’t be a factor this year, that’s for sure.” If fans are tired of the Patriots, it’s with good reason. They’ve been one half of the Super Bowl for nine of the past 18 years. They’ve won six of them, making the Patriots a modern-day dynasty that rivals — or surpasses — some of the greatest runs in sports. They’re the New York Yankees of another era except, of course, the Yankees didn’t cheat. Like all dynasties, though, this one appears ready to be shut down. Brady is getting old and so is Belichick's bullying act, and the sense of urgency when it comes to the big prize has long since vanished. There’s even a chance Brady...

FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) — Sometimes even No. 2 Baylor just has to find a way to win in the Big 12. The defending national champion Lady Bears, who have won the last nine league titles, overcame the absence of their leading scorer and a fourth-quarter deficit for a 66-57 victory over TCU on Wednesday night. “It wasn’t very good, but credit TCU. They do a lot of movement, a lot of picks, a lot of flows,\" coach Kim Mulkey said. “ We won a tough game on the road without NaLyssa Smith. We won a tough game on the road without making free throws. We’ll take it, get on that bus and head to Waco.\" The Lady Bears (16-1, 5-0 Big 12) extended their record Big 12 regular-season winning streak to 46 games over three years, even with Smith sidelined because of a sprained right ankle. After winning their first four league games by more than 37 points, they trailed by a point before opening the fourth quarter with eight points in a row. “We all just stayed calm and we knew what we had to do,\" Te'a Cooper said. “We focused on defense, get our stops, and we knew we had to knock down free throws. Queen Egbo, who started in place of Smith, and Cooper each had 14 points. Lauren Cox had 11 points, while DiDi Richards and Juicy Landrum each had 10. Kianna Ray had 16 points with four 3-pointers to lead TCU (13-4, 4-2), which had its three-game winning streak snapped. Jayde Woods had 13 points and Lauren Heard 11. “I thought our team came in prepared ... they approached this game like we approach every game,” Frogs coach Raegan Pebley said. “I’m proud of where their heads are at, prior to the game, in- game and postgame, and just having an unsatisfied mentality.” Egbo put Baylor ahead to stay with the her basket to start the fourth quarter. The 8-0 spurt included a...

The recently turned 39-year-old’s future had been in doubt since the end of the season. Manning’s contract with the Giants expired after the 4-12 season and there was little chance he would be returning after losing his longtime starting job to rookie Daniel Jones.
 Manning said he wanted to think about his future after the season and roughly three weeks after the season ended he decided his career was over.
 “For 16 seasons, Eli Manning defined what it is to be a New York Giant both on and off the field,” John Mara, the Giants’ president and chief executive officer, said in a statement.
 “Eli is our only two-time Super Bowl MVP and one of the very best players in our franchise’s history. He represented our franchise as a consummate professional with dignity and accountability. It meant something to Eli to be the Giants quarterback, and it meant even more to us. We are beyond grateful for his contributions to our organization and look forward to celebrating his induction into the Giants Ring of Honor in the near future.”

CORONA, Calif. (AP) — Four people were killed Wednesday in the crash of a small airplane at a Southern California airfield, authorities said. The plane went down at Corona Municipal Airport, about 40 miles (64 kilometers) east of Los Angeles, police said. Firefighters found the plane burning in brush on the east side of the airport, not far from one end of the runway. Four fatalities were confirmed, the Corona Fire Department said on Twitter. Witness Dorothe Voll said she saw the plane strike a fence during takeoff, turn over and quickly catch fire. It got no more than about 3 feet off the ground, she told the Orange County Register. There were two explosions and then heavy flames, Voll said. “We brought over fire extinguishers, but it was all engulfed,” she said. The plane was a single-engine Beechcraft Bonanza, said Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Ian Gregor. The FAA and National Transportation Safety Board will investigate, Gregor said. The airport was closed to flights after the crash. The airport is strictly for recreational aviation and has several hundred general aviation aircraft based there, according to its website.

Given the environment that gave birth to it, it’s unsurprising that the film’s endurability would have been unexpected at the time of its original release. But ultimately _Oz_ proved to be one of the films that convinced Hollywood that their motion picture backlog might have some future value in terms of theater revivals, television or both. Some of those films, like the adventures of Andy Hardy or Dr. Kildare, could be turned out for $400,000 or $500,000 and the studio would make their profit on those. If they were to do something like _Mutiny on the_ _Bounty,_ _The Great Ziegfeld_ or _Ben-Hur,_ these were more like spectacles that could still turn a profit. At the same time, Margaret Hamilton, who played the Wicked Witch of the West, once pointed out something interesting to John: There is a famously cut sequence from _The Wizard of Oz_ called “The Jitterbug” (a song and dance routine in the Haunted Forest for Dorothy, her companions and several fighting trees) which she told him was taken out because MGM feared it would date the picture with a contemporary song and dance. Relays John, “And Margaret asked an MGM executive, ‘How long do you think this picture will last?’ He told her, ‘We think it’s good for 10 years,’ and she replied, ‘You’re out of your mind.’ There was no reason to think it would live on — that any movie would live on. People went to the movies multiple times a week, and the next week, they went to a different movie — or two or three. It was the equivalent of going to the store every few days to buy milk and bread. You just ate your way through the entertainment and kept going — though, obviously, eventually the studios and the public began to recognize the true value of some of these films.”

Shifting the focus back to the duo of Judy and Mickey, John emphasizes, “They had versatility, they had the talent, they had similar backgrounds and they had a bond because of all that — and it just kind of leaped through the screen. Audiences always enjoyed seeing them together. And I think they enjoyed the fact that along about the seventh or eighth reel, Judy would bring Mickey down a peg, because his craziness had gotten out of control and she’d be the one who would center him. The nice thing about their films together, especially the four big musicals, is that by the time they got to the last of them, _Girl Crazy,_ _he_ was finally pining for _her_ and she was kind of poo- pooing _him_. This was totally refreshing after all the Andy Hardy movies and the other musicals where she’s kind of waiting until he gets tired of Lana Turner or June Preisser or Ann Rutherford. In _Girl Crazy_ , he has to do the waiting and the courting, because by 1942-1943, Judy Garland was the most beautiful she would be as a young woman.”

On top of that, there’s the conceit that the first 15 minutes are _not_ in black and white, they’re in sepia. Everything is in shades of brown, not black and white. And _then_ the fact that it burst into color was genius. It’s got nothing to do with Judy, but the first time you see Oz, the screen is lit up at a time when people didn’t look at color very often. And then you see _her_. In color. And she just takes your breath away.”

Sean 'Diddy' Combs's petition to change his name has been granted.
 The rap mogul and entrepreneur filed a petition to change his name to Sean Love Combs back in October, and according to court documents obtained by Entertainment Tonight, the alteration has been approved.
 Diddy's previous legal name was Sean John Combs, though professionally he has gone by Puff Daddy and P. Diddy for years.
 In November 2017, he took to Twitter to inform fans he was going by "Love, aka, Brother Love" and would "not be answering" to any other titles. Diddy later claimed the statement was made in jest, noting the name "was just part of one of my alter egos".
 He added, "You can address me by any of my older names, but if you still wanna call me Love, you can call me Love, baby. But I was only playing."
 The news comes as the music mogul continues to mourn the loss of his ex- girlfriend, Kim Porter. On Wednesday, he took to Instagram to share a heartfelt dedication to the late model - the mother of three of his children.
 "If you got a good woman please let her know," the 50-year-old posted. "Tell her as soon as you can. Make sure she knows. Make sure she feels it. HONOR HER. CHERISH HER. Cause the special ones are RARE and FEW. And everyone doesn't get a second chance. LET THE ONE YOU LOVE KNOW TODAY. RIGHT NOW!!!!"
 Kim passed away from pneumonia at her Los Angeles home in November 2018. The former couple dated on and off from 1994 to 2007, but remained close until her death.
