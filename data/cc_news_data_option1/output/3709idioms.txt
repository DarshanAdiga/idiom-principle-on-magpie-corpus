"You're coaching some guys on the fly and they're trying to execute as best they can," Duggan said. "Usually when you're down a couple players, the first area that takes the hit is the special teams because your back-line guys are being pulled up to be starters, and those are your major contributors to special teams."

"I think something has to happen with the laws of the game to make sure batsmen can't cheat and there certainly shouldn't be the rule the way it is. I think if you bring in some sort of run penalty for the batsman if they're deliberately leaving their crease and pinching ground that might be the way to go about it," Ponting told Cricket.com.au

"Every year or so I feel the urge to hit the road," Zhao says. "There is something about taking a shower at 5:30 in the morning at a truck stop. You walk outside and you see the big trucks coming in and you see the sun rising over the mountains. I forget about all the problems. I forget about all the things that I think define who I am, and just feel that transience, people coming in and out and existing."

Facebook risks weakening its standing if it follows through on a threat to stop Australian users sharing news, the head of the competition watchdog says.
 Under a landmark plan proposed by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the social media giant would be forced to compensate media companies for publishing their stories.
 The company earlier this month threatened to ban news on its own platform and on Instagram if the plan becomes law.
 ACCC chairman Rod Sims said it would be a shame for democracy if Facebook didn't allow news to be shared.
 "If it becomes known that you can never get news media on Facebook, what does that do to Facebook's standing? Will people go elsewhere?" he told an Australian Institute online seminar on Thursday.
 "I think it will weaken Facebook."
 The legislation is designed to ensure Facebook and Google fairly compensate news media companies for their work.
 Google has raised concerns with the draft code, claiming people's personal data could be compromised and their access to free services inhibited.
 Mr Sims firmly rebuffed the claims, saying the watchdog is "happily engaging" with Google.
 He said tweaks to the legislation were possible but insisted the core principle of the code would not change.
 "We're engaging with (Google) on all their issues and we'll make changes to address some of those issues, not all, but some," he said.
 Mr Sims said the code is crucial to ensuring diverse media in Australia and would allow greater negotiating power for smaller companies.
 "If this code was in place Buzzfeed would still have journalists in Australia," he said.
 The ACCC is hoping to deliver its final advice to the federal government by early October.

Bush and filmmaking partner Christopher Renz say they used 1970s horror films as inspiration. They hope to unsettle audiences when depicting terrors of the pre-abolition South. The Oscar-winning 1939 film “Gone With the Wind” became a touchstone. Bush describes it as both a “horror film” and “a piece of really effective propaganda.”
