It is an important fact that developing renewable energy is a must-have, a make-or-break commodity. Hence, most governments have already planned and are deploying strategies to achieve sustainable energy supply. Many countries around the world have instituted objectives to adopt and utilize renewable energy resources to shore up their power generation and consumption. By the adoption of policies and pursuance of targets, countries like China, United States (USA), Germany, United Kingdom (UK), Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have become world leaders in renewable energy, and are investing heavily into renewable energy technologies (RETs).

Energy related matters, particularly the production of electricity from renewable sources, are critical on the agendas of most governments around the world today. The United Nations’ Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 7- Access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all by 2030) and the Paris Agreement, emphasize the importance of energy sustainability, healthy ecosystem and decarbonisation.

Fuel prices were adjusted upward as predicted by the Institute for Energy Security (IES).

Prices of market leaders - Goil, Shell (Vivo), and Total rallied from Gh¢4.65 to close the window at Gh¢4.82.

It will therefore not be shocking that the post-COVID-19 era will be jam- packed with sustainable energy related programmes, and laggard governments that are slow to adopt and advance their renewable energy resources, risk being left behind – or worse, will completely be shut out. They will suffer consequences such as slow social and economic development, augmented environmental problems resulting from continued reliance on fossil fuel energy resources.
