Excuse me, Senator.
 I listened to your news conference with the other Republicans and Democrats who were on board with you on this compromise, which raises the question, where -- again, where is the leadership and the rest of these two political parties?
 As we know, for the Democrats, one of the main sticking points has been aid for state and local governments. That money appears to be in a second proposal, as well as so-called liability protection for businesses, hospitals and others.
 My question on that is, why isn't there agreement there? And is that still going to hold up agreement on this, what you put forward, what we just discussed?

 # How Colts' All-Pro guard Quenton Nelson ended up moonlighting at left tackle

 INDIANAPOLIS — The Indianapolis Colts stumbled on the idea of using Quenton Nelson as an emergency left tackle almost by accident.
 Nelson, arguably the best guard in football, hadn’t played tackle since he backed up Zack Martin, a former Bishop Chatard star and current Dallas Cowboys lineman, in his early days at Notre Dame. Injuries along the Colts front the past couple of weeks forced Nelson to play a little left tackle on scout team.
 The Indianapolis coaching staff liked what it saw.
 Liked it enough that after the Colts lost Anthony Castonzo and Le’Raven Clark in back-to-back weeks, the wheels started turning. Third-string tackle Chaz Green struggled on the left side in relief of Clark against Houston, and with Castonzo’s status up in the air, the Colts started thinking about moving their best offensive lineman outside.
 “Still had confidence in Chaz, but Quenton is Quenton Nelson,” Reich said. “And that spot is very important, so we knew that if we put him out there, he’s the kind of player that would rise to the occasion.”
 If Nelson hadn’t taken a few snaps on the scout team in the weeks before Clark’s injury, the Colts might have been more reluctant to make the move.
 “Actually, we’d rather have him not do anything on scout team,” Reich said. “But because of injuries and stuff like that, and roster considerations … the past two weeks, we’ve been down in numbers a little bit, so our starters, what we do is they rotate in.”
 The Colts coaching staff noticed how good Nelson looked in those scout-team snaps, and although Indianapolis felt good about Castonzo’s chances of returning against the Raiders, Reich and the coaching staff knew they needed a contingency plan.
 Castonzo’s MCL sprain is an injury that typically takes three to six weeks to heal; the 10-year veteran was trying to come back after missing just one game.
 The Colts started talking about moving Nelson out to left tackle at the beginning of last week, and as the week progressed and Castonzo started battling his way back, Indianapolis made sure to give Nelson a few first-team reps at left tackle.
 Five snaps into the game, the Colts’ fears were realized. Castonzo’s knee locked up on him a little and he left the game, and although Indianapolis sent Green into the game to finish that series, it was time to turn to Nelson.
 Nelson ended up playing eight snaps at left tackle on Sunday; the Colts ran the ball on four of those snaps and passed on four. One of the snaps was a screen, a play that didn’t require Nelson to take a traditional pass set.
 On the other three plays, Nelson deftly handled a Raiders stunt, stonewalled a Vic Beasley bull rush and then handled Beasley’s speed around the edge with ease.
 “The handful of snaps that he got in there, it looked good,” Reich said. “His pass sets actually looked really good.”
 And now the Colts know Nelson can play left tackle in a pinch.

your employers weren't safe enough, you didn't sanitize enough, things of that sort. There's a lot of things we didn't know.
 I went ahead and signed onto that bill with my Republican colleagues, in the spirit of bipartisanship, because, basically, everyone has to give and take. My reason is, is, they shortened their time element from five years to two years, one year back, one year forward, not one year back and four years forward, and made some other critical changes.
 I'm sure it's not good enough for a lot of people.
 But here's the thing, Judy. If, for some reason, they can't come to an agreement, and the Senate and the House Democrats and Republicans won't agree, then that stays by itself, because those two are -- those two are one bill, liability and state and local help.

MOUNT VERNON, Texas
 Art Briles resigned Monday after leading Mount Vernon to the semifinals of the state playoffs in his second season at the East Texas high school.
 The former Baylor coach had a 20-6 record in two seasons with Mount Vernon. The run to the semifinals ended with a 24-17 loss to Tuscola Jim Ned.
 The 65-year-old Briles didn't indicate what he would do next in a statement announcing his resignation. He was fired at Baylor four years ago amid a sexual assault scandal. Briles has insisted he didn't cover up reports of assaults by his players.
 Briles was coaching a professional team in Italy when Mount Vernon hired him in May 2019. He had been unable to get a coaching job in the United States after an external investigation revealed in May 2016 that Baylor had for years mishandled numerous sexual assault allegations by students, including some against football players.
 Southern Mississippi coach Jay Hopson wanted to hire Briles as offensive coordinator in February, but the school's athletic director quashed the idea. He was hired as an assistant by Hamilton in the Canadian Football League in 2017, but the Tiger-Cats quickly rescinded the move after facing some public backlash.

Judy, I'm as confident as I am standing here talking to you that this is real.
 This language is done. The bill is -- this is not just a concept. Two weeks ago, we gave basically an Outline. That's all we had was an outline showing you how we come to 908. We worked it and worked it and worked it for the last 30 days, morning, noon and night. Our staff has been going around. We have been on Zoom calls and phone calls continuously every day.
 We have came -- we have come to this, after a lot, a lot of discussions, back- and-forth bantering, talking to our caucuses respectively, Democrat and Republican, and representing them. No one else has done anything like this.
 If the leadership all of a sudden wants to reinvent the wheel, that's what they would be doing. We would hope that they would say, thank you all for what you have done, because, sometimes, they hit an impasse.
