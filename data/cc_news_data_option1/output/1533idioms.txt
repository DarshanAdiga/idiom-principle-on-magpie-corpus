X-Backend-State: Backend up and running

Poor results in off-season friendlies and the first four matches of the domestic Apertura championship and defeat by Brazil's Internacional in the South American Supercup last month did not help Mohamed's cause.
 "I'm not taking this decision, the barra bravas took it," said Mohamed, using the term for gangs of hooligan fans who blight Argentine football, after saying farewell to the players at Independiente's training grounds.
 About 200 Independiente barra bravas chanted insults at the players and Mohamed outside the changing rooms at the Libertadores de America stadium after Sunday's night's defeat, calling for them to go. As the team left the ground they played a funeral dirge.
 "Ninety percent of the fans did not insult [us during the match] and have always backed... the players and coaching staff. Yesterday, a group of barra bravas, sent or not sent [to do this], went to insult us and left a very clear message," Mohamed told reporters.
 There have been reports of a relationship between barrabravas and club directors for years with the latter financing trips to away matches and even abroad. Sources close to the club said Mohamed had refused to give in to barrabravas' demands for money.
 Mohamed, a former Argentina striker who had been in charge for 11 months, steered Independiente to victory in last year's Copa Sudamericana, South America's Europa League equivalent, leaves with a record of 16 wins and 16 defeats in 51 matches.
 "The club were international champions, will play the next Sudamericana, are three points from qualifying for the Copa Libertadores... this wasn't a sporting issue," Mohamed said.
 "Argentine football is in a bad state," added Mohamed, whose place will be taken for the time being by caretaker Christian Diaz, a junior team coach.
 Independiente are the record seven times South American champions but the last time they won the Copa Libertadores was in 1984. They have 14 domestic league titles but only two in the era of two championships per season which began 20 years ago.

Such was the hush in the Rasunda Stadium that conversations between the players were clearly audible.
 It was almost as if the match was being played behind closed doors, but the ground was far from empty with 24,639 supporters inside.
 Set up by 34 supporters' groups representing football and hockey clubs from Sweden, the "Positive Terrace Culture" campaign hopes the silent protest will convince the FA and the media that things are not as bad as they seem.
 It will be an uphill struggle given the match became the latest this season to be held up due to fans' misbehaviour.
 Matches have also been abandoned with both Djurgarden and AIK among teams affected when supporters threw fireworks onto the field.
 The derby between Malmo and Helsingborg was halted after Helsingborg goalkeeper Par Hansson was attacked by a fan while a ballboy, a linesman and a cameraman have all been injured by firecrackers during the campaign.
 Many fans though believe the FA has gone too far in banning fireworks from arenas altogether and fining clubs whose supporters sing demeaning songs about referees.
 Fan groups have also accused Swedish media of exaggerating the dangers associated with attending football matches, saying that Sweden's football stadiums have never been safer.
 AIK defender Nils-Erik Johansson said the silent protest at the Stockholm derby, won 1-0 by Djurgarden, had an effect on the players.
 "It wasn't nice," he told Reuters. "We understand that the fans want to make a point and they certainly did that today. It felt like the game only really got going after 10 minutes.
 "We are in this situation now where a few people make bad decisions and the bigger group gets punished. It's not how it should be. A whole community should not be punished for what one or two guys are doing."
 Whatever effect the silent protest had on the players or the media, it is likely to fall on deaf ears with the FA as once again a game was disrupted due to fans firing off pyrotechnics.
 At the start of the second half, both sets of fans ignited Bengal fireworks in a co-ordinated protest, delaying the game for six minutes.
 Referee Jonas Eriksson followed the FA's fireworks policy to the letter and removed the players from the pitch as the arena was engulfed in a cloud of smoke.
 When the smoke cleared, the teams returned to the field and Djurgarden hung on to win thanks to a goal from Kennedy Igboananike.

Robert Edward Dearing Robert Edward Dearing passed away peacefully, in his home, April 14, 2020 after a courageous battle against cancer and other illnesses with immediate family members at his side. He will be missed by many who admired him for his generous and charming personality. Bob was born June 8, 1940 in Kansas City, Missouri to his parents James Coy and Margueritte Dearing. He graduated Northeast High School in 1958 and maintained those close friendships throughout his lifetime. Bob spent a brief time at William Jewel College. Throughout the years, he was employed by Montgomery Ward, Bearing Distributers of Kansas City, Best Foods, Trans World Airlines, Ford Motor Company and Positive Identifications, Incorporated. After becoming the proprietor of Positive Identifications, Incorporated, he continued the business under the title Kelly Dawn Systems, Inc., which currently operates throughout the United States and internationally. Bob was an active member of Blue Hills Country Club. He cherished the memories of golf with his wife and friends, and the lifelong friendships he established on and off the golf course. His travels around the world with his family were filled with laughter, joy and love. As a member of the Sacred Heart Catholic Church in Palm Desert, California, the weekly homily given by Father Howard Lincoln became Bob's goal to lead a good life and appreciate all the blessings life had given him and reminded everyone to take turns pulling into the exit lane in the church parking lot. Bob is survived by his high school sweetheart, Marilyn, wife of 59 years; his daughter Kelly Jo Dearing of Lee's Summit, Missouri; granddaughter Kelsey Nicole Dearing-St. Clair of Kansas City; brother James Earl (Alice) Dearing of Kansas City, Missouri; sister-in-law Charlotte Hancock of Raymore, Missouri; brother-in-law David Lynn Williams (Mary) of Lee's Summit, Missouri; sister-in-law Sue Williams of Kansas City, Missouri, and several nieces and nephews. He was preceded in death by his parents, daughter Dawn Renee Dearing; brothers Phillip Eugene and Bill Dearing; brother-in-law Donald Williams; brother-in-law Mike Hancock, and mother and father-in-law Threldon and Marguerite Williams. A private family gravesite burial will be held. A celebration of Bob's life of love, joy, happiness and success will be celebrated at a later date.
