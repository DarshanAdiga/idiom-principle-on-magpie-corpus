1. “Difficult” relationships are about self-love and self-worth – ours, not theirs.   2. We’ve set causes in motion, and we’re experiencing the results. So our problems are not originating outside of us.   3. Our partners aren’t broken, and it’s not our job to fix them.   4. Relating is like riding an elevator. If we don’t do something different, such as select a new number, the doors will open, and we’ll get out on the same floor.   5. Separation ends relationships, not problems. So we take our unanswered issues with us and keep attracting people who can help us resolve them.   6. Getting rid of our partners won’t get rid of our problems.   7. Everyone is right from his or her perspective, which means that no one is wrong. So criticizing and blaming need to be off-limits. _Try arguing without saying “you.”_   8. We’re the ones responsible for our emotions and reactions, so it’s not appropriate to make people wrong so that we can justify our outbursts.   9. Whatever our partners give us is what we believe we deserve.   10. The best way to show our partners how to treat us, in the way we want, is to be an example of what we want.   11. When we see our partners’ _worst_ , it’s also active in us, and they’re mirroring it for us.   12. There will always be plenty of evidence to prove whatever we declare is true, because our lives are the result of whatever we believe.   13. Our partners can’t affect us emotionally until we’ve chosen what to believe about them and their behavior.   14. Whatever words we use to describe our partners, they can’t be anything else for us, because we can only experience what we believe about them. _So don’t keep confirming, in thoughts or words, what you don’t want._   15. Our predictable responses keep our partners treating us in a predictable manner.   16. Making a conscious decision to stop being triggered by what our partners say and do will de-activate our buttons and give us back our power. And if we change our usual response, our partners will also change their behavior.   17. If we want people to act differently toward us, it begins by acting differently ourselves. Until we change, nothing will change.   18. If our partners lose it, the most important issue is their need to be supported. So it’s our job to stay supportive, protecting their self-esteem and allowing them to save face.   19. We draw the best from our partners by believing the best about them, knowing that they’ll become whatever we decide to see.   20. Expressing appreciation does more than anything else to create positive change in our relationships.

An NBC report said that Israel was involved in tracking Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps al Quds Force chief Qasem Soleimani leading to the US drone strike killing him on January 3.
 But this is all only coming out from the US media, seemingly mostly from US sources, and Liberman himself was only responding to these reports and slamming any Israelis involved in promoting these reports.
 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also gave explicit instructions to the security cabinet after the incident to keep their heads down.
 If in fact Israel helped the US nail possibly the worst living terrorist on the planet with the blood of countless Israelis on his hands over decades of terror, why isn't Israel proudly taking credit?
 The answer - Israel hopes to avoid direct Iranian against it - lies in the difference between Israel and the US's geopolitical positions and, most importantly, the success Israel had in keeping a low profile when it destroyed Syria's nuclear reactor in 2007.
 Israel is invariably more careful than the US, especially in the Trump administration era, about taking credit for assassinations or military actions beyond its borders.
 There were years of Israeli strikes to block Iran from transferring advanced weapons to militias in Syria or to Hezbollah in Lebanon before Netanyahu and Eisenkot eventually admitted to some of the strikes.
 Besides any legal concerns, Jerusalem probably didn't want Iran, Syria or Hezbollah to lose face or feel the need to respond.
 The most well-known example of this was a broad Israeli effort to say nothing about its massive airstrikes and commando raids, according to foreign sources, into Syria in 2007 to confirm the existence of and destroy Bashar Assad's secret nuclear reactor.
 Attacking such a major strategic asset of an enemy could easily have led to not just blowback, but even all-out war with Syria.
 Yet, because Assad had kept the reactor's existence secret, he had heavy incentives simply to say nothing publicly to save face.
 Israel's involvement was only officially confirmed over a decade later when the attack was ancient history and Assad was viewed as weaker and deterred.
 Further, the entire purpose of the Mossad, 99% of the time, is to allegedly take out terrorists from Malaysia to Tunis so that Jerusalem can protect Israeli security without military blowback.
 Israel's spy agency usually tries to take out only one person at a time and its standard procedure is to do so in a less public area, making the killing as low profile as possible.
 Frequently, reports of an alleged Mossad assassination take time to even reach the public sphere, since other than suddenly uncovering a dead terrorist's body, no one knows what happened and when.
 Although the US may also sometimes act clandestinely, clearly the Trump administration wanted to kill Soleimani in the loudest way possible in order to deter the Islamic Republic from future aggression.
 This is probably why Netanyahu and other Israeli officials would go to such lengths to avoid Israeli confirmation of its involvement, according to the NBC report.
 In contrast, Trump and some of his team are known as being among the most open-mouthed administrations in history to brag about military successes.
 To the extant the claim of alleged Israeli involvement came from Trump officials, it was not necessarily taking into account Israel's desires as much as it was giving a full and comprehensive story to NBC and others to get maximum media coverage of the overall story.
 If Israeli sources were involved as sources for the NBC report, as Liberman claims, they still took the trouble to claim Jerusalem's alleged involvement anonymously to foreign media in order to partially cover their tracks.
 This could be an attempt to take some credit nine days after the incident and in a round-about enough way to lower the risk of retaliation by Iran against Israel.
 In the meantime, if the attack on Syria's nuclear reactor is any sign, it could be some time before the full alleged Israeli involvement is revealed.
