The writer of this comment is possibly not investigating the facts but is sadly instigating people by misrepresenting the facts and happenings in India, particularly in Uttar Pradesh (“CAA-NRC protests: Yogi Adityanath’s police continue its hunt-down against Muslims in UP”, Gulf News, December 27). Taking legal and legitimate action against the lawbreakers and violent protestors is a normal action taken by any country, including India. Hence this administrative action taken, cannot be called a revenge by any stretch of imagination. Such reporting is sad and unfortunate. Please do not try to fish in troubled waters.

TD: I think that we are simply being criticized for intervening in the debate; more clearly - this is a form of appearance-based prejudice - we are criticized for our mere existence. I think that we are also decried for the tone that we have adopted, a tone that does not judge or condemn, but that forcefully says what is, at the end of the day, the truth. This is significant of the post-truth society, which tends to stifle the affirmation of true realities.

After three years of intense Brexit debate, the general election appears to have taken the heat out of the issue for now. However, before very long Britain will face a new series of cliff edges and more intense political debates about the country's new place in the world. With such little time to make these decisions and implement them, there is lots of room for things to go awry.
 "There are absolutely legitimate concerns [about this] because actually it's a very, very complicated piece of law which affects a lot of technical areas, and there's a real danger of things going wrong," Menon says.
 "Of not having thought things through properly, of doing things on the back of an envelope, of parliament ceding so much power to the executive that a lot of the serious business of reshaping the country post-Brexit will be done by statutory instruments rather than proper legislation, so it will escape any sort of scrutiny."
 Maddy Thimont Jack, from the Institute for Government agrees. "It is so much faster than what you'd usually expect for such a constitutionally significant piece of legislation. With the Lisbon Treaty, it took 26 sitting days to pass legislation relating to it, but 200 calendar days.
 "Usually you want time to take evidence from experts, for example, but they're having to operate in a much tighter time scale. A big part of the bill is implementing legislation relating to citizens' rights. Lots of civil society organisations are very concerned about this but there's very little time for them to get involved."

It feels like there's been over 9,000 games made about Dragon Ball Z, but we still can't get enough of this classic anime franchise. Over the last few years the Dragon Ball Xenoverse RPG series has offered up players a chance to fight alongside and as their favorite characters from DBZ. The big difference between Xenoverse and Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot is that it has you playing as Goku through all the major DBZ story arcs starting with the Saiyan Saga. It also features a lot of open-world style adventuring instead of having players take on brawls via a hub world. It's not the first time Bandai Namco has done a more traditional RPG for the Dragon Ball gang, but it's been a long time to say the least.

The truth is we don't know. The pre-election provisions on workers' rights were in reality only ever a fig-leaf for Labour MPs who wanted to back the deal. No parliament can ever bind a future one and as soon as Johnson won a majority he was free to do whatever he wanted with workers' rights, regardless of what was in this bill.
 And while he may rip up workers' right he may instead choose to strengthen them. As Professor Anand Menon of the UK in a Changing Europe think tank tells Business Insider: "You've got to bear in mind that it's what the manifesto says about those things that matter.
 "One of the interesting things about the Tory manifesto is that it's left the door ajar... to get beyond what the EU does in areas like workers' rights."
 The government insists it will pass new legislation this parliament to further protect workers' rights. However, the detail remains sketchy and we will only know whether he actually will when that legislation is brought forward. What we do know is that the future of workers' rights will not be decided by this Brexit bill.
 ## Will MPs make any more changes to the bill?

Cuomo wants to put NJTransit trains in a new depot between 30th and 31st Sts. from Seventh to Eighth Aves., plowing under a big swath of Midtown. The Long Island Rail Road would take over the former NJT spots in Penn proper.
 Cash from the new terminal’s air rights would foot the bill, which Amtrak pegged at $6 billion. Penn South failed as part of Amtrak’s discredited Gateway scheme. But as a real estate deal, could it work?
 There are much cheaper and faster Penn improvements. Once the Farley General Post Office is converted into Moynihan Train Hall for Amtrak and LIRR at year’s end, New York must insist that Amtrak relinquish its stranglehold over Penn itself. Then this Gov. Cuomo must do to the NJT/Amtrak half of Penn (Tracks 1 to 12) exactly what the first Gov. Cuomo did to the LIRR’s Tracks 13 to 21, and modernize them.
 Mario extended all platforms to accommodate trains 12 cars long and opened the West End Concourse in 1986. In 1993, he built the central corridor. Those changes doubled the vertical access points with new stairways, escalators and elevators, decreasing boarding times. NJT’s eight- and nine-car long tracks can’t even use Moynihan.
 Fixing the outdated half of Penn is the fastest, cheapest, smartest way to making it better for all.

But adding in co-op play with more mind-bending stages and liquid physics is going to make Spelunky 2 one of the most anticipated indie efforts of the year.

 Two years ago, it was on the Minneapolis Miracle and last year it was in overtime to the Rams after the infamous non-call on a blatant pass interference, which led to a rules change in 2019.
 This time, it was on a tight end Kyle Rudolph’s touchdown grab in overtime that gave Minnesota a 26-20 win moments after Cousins hit Adam Thielen for 43 yards to the Saints 2-yard line.
 Saints fans argued that Rudolph pushed off defensive back P.J. Williams on the game-winning catch.

ST. JOSEPH, Mo. -- Fast - often blistering - starts to games have been a virtual staple, both pro and con, in Chillicothe High School basketball Hornets play through the 2019 portion of their season.   That trend continued - positively, this time - Monday, Dec. 30, when the Hornets bolted ahead of the host team 14-2 and never were threatened in what concluded as a 60-36 romp in the third-place game of the Bishop LeBlond Holiday Tournament.   When the last second ticked off, the contest had clandestinely matched not only a CHS boys' hoops record, but a world record, too, as BLHS' Golden Eagles failed to make any 2-points basket. Their scoring output was evenly split between a half-dozen trifectas and 18-of-20 free-throw sharpshooting.   Way back in 1922, when games featured limited scoring, CHS' Hornets defeated long-since-vanished Chula High School in a game in which Chula tallied only a single free throw.   Presumably thousands of times in the century-plus since James Naismith first nailed peach baskets to a wall, one team in a game - possibly, on occasion, both - completed the contest without having scored a basket. However, over the past 70 years or so - and likely even less often since the advent of a 3-points shot caused defenses to guard farther from the rim, the number of times a team was blanked from 2-points range figures to be relatively small.   "Pretty sure that's the first time I've seen a team go an entire game without a 2-point basket," Chillicothe head coach Tim Cool, in his third decade of coaching high school teams and having seen his share of games before then, acknowledged.   The Hornets (6-3) will return to Bishop LeBlond's gym next Thursday for their Midland Empire Conference opener. Before that, on Tuesday, they will get to play at home for the first time, weather permitting (see related story on preceding page). Lawson will be the opponent in what will be CHS' annual "Teddy Bear Toss" game.   In the final-round game of the LeBlond-hosted tourney, Mason Baxter's 3-points shot on the game's opening possession got the Hornets off on the right foot, at which point the CHS combo of seniors Westley Brandsgaard and C.J. Pfaff began doing its usual "thing."   The former's trey and free throw and latter's patented pass-interception and runout for a dunk made it 9-0, Chillicothe, before Bishop LeBlond got on the "Bill" Grace Gymnasium scoreboard. When We. Brandsgaard followed two Golden Eagles free throws with a second triple and Pfaff tacked on a driving deuce from the right wing, the Hornets possessed a 14-2 lead before Bishop LeBlond got its first field goal.   After doubling the Golden Eagles in each of the first two periods to take a 30-15 advantage to the locker room at halftime, Chillicothe extended that ratio of dominance several minutes into the fourth quarter, owning a 51-24 lead after a couple of Baxter charity tosses early in the last segment. An upgrade in Bishop LeBlond's offensive performance in the remaining time then nibbled a few points off the final spread.   When the final horn sounded, We. Brandsgaard had virtually matched his season scoring average by putting up a game-best 22 tallies on, officially, 7-of-9 overall shooting from the floor, including a 3-of-5 showing beyond the arc. The points total inched his season average up to 21.4 per game on a team- leading 54 percent shooting rate from the field.   Pfaff concluded Monday's game with 15 points, like We. Brandsgaard sinking all of the 2-points shots he triggered, including two breakaway "flushes." His season scoring average slipped a smidgen to 16.9. The long-armed, 6'4" guard made a team-best four steals and leads the club with an average of three a contest heading into 2020.   Junior 5'9" guard Baxter, who had a very good tournament, seasoned the entire CHS performance. He netted five points, led the team in rebounds with seven, had two assists, two steals, and two shot blocks, according to team stats.   Fellow 11th grader Hayden Simmer shared the team lead in assists with Pfaff with four and also equaled Pfaff's half-dozen rebounds.   Bishop LeBlond's scoring was paced by junior guard Isaac Ferguson's 10 points.

Arms manufacturers are no less culpable ethically, or tangibly, if their weapons are used by citizens of one country or the other.

By PAUL STURM, C-T Sports Editor   If you wander into the Chillicothe High School gymnasium Tuesday night (Jan. 7, 2020), that won't be a mirage. It will be the CHS basketball Hornets in the flesh, finally playing a game on their home hardwoods 10 games and a month into their 2019-20 season.   And, if you both want to see the most-critical portion of their game against the Lawson Cardinals and participate in the annual "Teddy Bear Toss" charity event, you'll likely need to be there for the opening tipoff at approximately 7 p.m.   Winners of six of their first nine games - five on neutral courts, the Hornets and Lady Hornets will face non-conference opponent Lawson in an evening of play that also will include junior-varsity girls' and boys' action at split sites.   While the JV boys and Lawson duel on the middle school fieldhouse parquet floor at 4:30 p.m., the schools' "B" girls will square off in the first of three contests at the CHS gym at the same time.

The bill will enter its committee stage on Tuesday when MPs will go through it line-by-line to see whether it requires any amendment. Lots of amendments will likely be put forward. However, unless there is a part of the bill which Conservative MPs en masse themselves suddenly have the desire to change, then it will likely travel through the House unchanged. One change that Conservative MPs do want to see is that the Big Ben bell, which is currently out of action due to refurbishment, should ring out on Brexit day. If House of Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle agrees to consider that amendment, which on the face of it seems unlikely given its tangential relationship to the main purpose of the bill, then there would likely be a majority for that change.

South Africa have come out in support of four-day Test matches, refuting reports that said they would oppose the plan.
 The ICC is set to discuss the idea of making Tests four-day games to ease a crammed international calendar and reduce player workload.
 England have said they will support the idea after 2023 while Australia are to give serious consideration to the plan.
 Britain's Daily Mail newspaper reported that South Africa would oppose the idea, despite the country becoming the first to host a four-day Test when they played Zimbabwe in 2017.
 "In view of an unsourced and misleading report in the media this morning, please be advised that it is Cricket South Africa’s official policy to support four-day Test match cricket," Cricket South Africa said in a statement.
 "We, in fact, hosted the first official four-day Test match between ourselves and Zimbabwe a couple of years ago."
 South Africa beat Zimbabwe by an innings midway through day two of that Test in Port Elizabeth.
 The powerful BCCI has yet to offer an opinion, but India captain Virat Kohli said he was totally against the plan.
 "I am not a fan," Kohli told reporters. "I think the intent will not be right then because then you will speak of three-day Tests, I mean where do you end?
 "Then you will speak of test cricket disappearing. I don't endorse that at all."

It looks to be an adventure that explores an entirely new storyline (free of comic and movie continuity), one seeking to create emotional investment on the level of Marvel's Spider-Man from Insomniac a couple of years ago. The individual character gameplay and the campaign layout will go a long way towards determining whether this game can live up to its potential, but given what Crystal Dynamics has been able to pull off in the past, the prognosis is trending positive.

TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Weeping amid wails from a sea of mourners, Iran's supreme leader on Monday prayed over the remains of a top Iranian general killed in a U.S. airstrike in Baghdad, an attack that's drastically raised tensions between Tehran and Washington.   The targeted killing of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani drew a crowd, said by police to be in the millions, on Monday in Tehran, where Soleimani's replacement vowed to take revenge. Additionally, Tehran has abandoned the remaining limits of its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers in response to the slaying while in Iraq, the parliament has called for the expulsion of all American troops from Iraqi soil.   The developments could bring Iran closer to building an atomic bomb, set off a proxy or military attack launched by Tehran against America and enable the Islamic State group to stage a comeback in Iraq, making the Middle East a far more dangerous and unstable place.   Adding to the tensions, President Donald Trump threatened to demand billions of dollars in compensation from Iraq or impose "sanctions like they've never seen before" if it goes through with expelling U.S. troops.   Soleimani's daughter, Zeinab, directly threatened an attack on the U.S. military in the Mideast while speaking to a crowd that stretched as far as the eye could see down major thoroughfares in Iran's capital.   "The families of the American soldiers in western Asia ... will spend their days waiting for the death of their children," she said to cheers. Iranian state television and others online shared a video that showed Trump's American flag tweet following Soleimani's killing turn into a coffin, the "likes" of the tweet replaced by over 143,000 "killed" with the hashtag #severerevenge.   Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei himself prayed over the caskets of Soleimani and others slain in the attack. Khamenei, who had a close relationship with Soleimani, wept at one point during the traditional Muslim prayers for the dead. The crowd wailed.   Soleimani's successor, Esmail Ghaani stood near Khamenei's side, as did Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and other top leaders in the Islamic Republic. While Iran recently faced nationwide protests over government-set gasoline prices that reportedly killed over 300 people, Soleimani's mass processionals has seen politicians and leaders across the Islamic Republic's political spectrum take part, temporarily silencing that anger.   Demonstrators burned Israeli and U.S. flags, carried a flag-draped U.S. coffin or effigies of Trump. Some described Trump himself as a legitimate target for Iran's revenge.   Mohammad Milad Rashidi, a 26-year-old university graduate, predicted more tension ahead.   "Trump demolished the chance for any sort of possible agreement between Tehran and Washington," Rashidi said. "There will be more conflict in the future for sure."   Ghaani made his own threat in an interview with Iranian state television aired Monday. "God the Almighty has promised to get his revenge, and God is the main avenger. Certainly actions will be taken," he said.   Markets reacted Monday to the tensions, sending international benchmark Brent crude above $70 a barrel. The Middle East remains a crucial source of oil and Iran in the past has threatened the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf through which 20% of all the world's oil traded passes.   Ghaani, a longtime Soleimani deputy, has now taken over as the head of the Revolutionary Guard's Quds Force, an expeditionary arm of the paramilitary organization answerable only to Khamenei. Ghaani has been sanctioned by the U.S. since 2012 for his work funding its operations around the world, including its work with proxies in Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen.   Those proxies likely will be involved in any operation targeting U.S. interests in the Mideast or elsewhere in the world.   Already, the U.S. Embassy in Saudi Arabia warned Americans "of the heightened risk of missile and drone attacks." In Lebanon, the leader of the Iranian- backed militant group Hezbollah said Soleimani's killing made U.S. military bases, warships and service members across the region fair game for attacks. A former Iranian Revolutionary Guard leader suggested the Israeli city of Haifa and others could be targeted should the U.S. attack Iran.   "We promise to continue down martyr Soleimani's path as firmly as before with help of God, and in return for his martyrdom we aim to get rid of America from the region," Ghaani said.   The head of the Guard's aerospace program, Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh, suggested Iran's response wouldn't stop with a single attack.   "Firing a couple of missiles, hitting a base or even killing Trump is not valuable enough to compensate for martyr Soleimani's blood," Hajizadeh said on state TV. "The only thing that can compensate for his blood is the complete removal of America from the region and taking away their evil from the oppressed people of the region."   On the nuclear deal, Iranian state television cited Sunday a statement by Rouhani's administration saying the country would not observe the nuclear deal's restrictions on fuel enrichment, on the size of its enriched uranium stockpile and on its research and development activities.   German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson specifically urged Iran to "withdraw all measures" not in line with the 2015 agreement that was intended to stop Tehran from pursuing its atomic weapons program.   Iran insisted that it remains open to negotiations with European partners over its nuclear program. And it did not back off from earlier promises that it wouldn't seek a nuclear weapon.   However, the announcement represents the clearest nuclear proliferation threat yet made by Iran since Trump unilaterally withdrew from the accord in 2018 and reimposed sanctions last year. It further raises regional tensions, as Iran's longtime foe Israel has promised never to allow Iran to produce an atomic bomb.   Iran did not elaborate on what levels it would immediately reach in its program. Tehran has already broken some of the deal's limits as part of a step-by-step pressure campaign to get sanctions relief. It already has increased its production, begun enriching uranium to 5% and restarted enrichment at an underground facility.   While it does not possess uranium enriched to weapons-grade levels of 90%, any push forward narrows the estimated one-year "breakout time" needed for it to have enough material to build a nuclear weapon if it chose to do so.   The International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations watchdog observing Iran's program, did not respond to a request for comment. However, Iran said that its cooperation with the IAEA "will continue as before."   Soleimani's killing has escalated the crisis between Tehran and Washington after months of back-and-forth attacks and threats that have put the wider Middle East on edge. Iran has promised "harsh revenge" while Trump has vowed on Twitter that the U.S. will strike back at 52 targets "VERY FAST AND VERY HARD. "   He doubled down on that threat Sunday, dismissing warnings that targeting cultural sites could be a war crime under international law.   "They're allowed to kill our people. They're allowed to torture and maim our people. They're allowed to use roadside bombs and blow up our people. And we're not allowed to touch their cultural sites? It doesn't work that way," Trump told reporters.   The processions for Soleimani mark the first time Iran honored a single man with a multi-city ceremony. Not even Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who founded the Islamic Republic, received such a processional with his death in 1989.   Soleimani will be buried in his hometown of Kerman.   ___   Gambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.
