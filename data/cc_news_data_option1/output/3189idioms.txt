Everything changed when Tim gave her a lift home from a colleague's party and she realised: "I've got this guy completely wrong."
 The couple married in London in 1988 and their son Matt - of the band 1975 fame - was born the following year.
 Meanwhile, her career was also starting to take off with a breakthrough role as Marsha Stubbs in ITV's Soldier Soldier followed by that of barmaid Natalie Horrocks in Coronation Street in 1997.
 But behind the scenes, Denise, now 62, was falling apart. Living miles away from Tim, now 68, and her son, who were still up in Northumberland, she was suffering from severe clinical depression which she'd tried to self-medicate with cocaine and alcohol.
 At her lowest ebb, she would find excuses to sneak off set to meet her dealer, and secretly take the Class A drug in between scenes.

This helps to tackle the problem of downtimes, which is one of the inefficiencies that challenge logistics operations. According to a Trelleborg barometer report, 90% of ports surveyed suffer from unscheduled downtime. With an estimated $40 billion market value, ports can improve operations by utilizing complementary predictive maintenance tech to ensure minimum downtimes and guarantee a short turnaround time. The most recent United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) Review of Maritime Transport acknowledged the importance of turnaround times, citing that a shorter time in the port is generally indicative of high port efficiency and trade competitiveness.

Porsches in particular have taken a hit. At the most recent Gooding sale, a 1984 Porsche 911 Carrera and a 1978 Porsche 928 failed to reach their low- price reserves and did not sell; an over-hyped 1971 Porsche 911 in rally-style livery also stalled out, with a final high bid at $630,000—half its $1.2 million high estimate. At RM Sotheby’s in May, a 1978 Porsche 911 Turbo custom car, a 1960 Porsche 350, and a 2008 911 GT3 all failed to sell online; in July, a 1968 Porsche 912 Targa, a 1991 Porsche 911 Turbo, and a 1988 Porsche 944 also failed to sell, among others. Such results indicate that the Porsche bubble that pushed 911 Turbos and their vintage brethren to Everest heights over the past years has officially popped. Serio has long described the cooling of the Porsche market as a “healthy” correction. In General, Modern Cars Fare Better Online Several lesser-known Ferraris at recent online auctions have failed to sell, too, victims of optimistic pandemic pricing that expected them to follow the lead of rarer examples. Ditto a gaggle of prewar coaches and a Mercedes-Benz 300SL Gullwing that Gooding failed to sell—a particular disappointment, although instructive as to which types of cars sell better online than in person. Mercedes 300SLs generally serve as “gold standard” indicators about the health of the collector car market, Gooding says, but those that are less than immaculate don’t present as well online as they do in person. All things being equal, newer and better-known cars fare better in online sales than older cars. The modern ones can offer the benefit of Carfax and other ownership data, which confer peace of mind about a vehicle’s mechanical stability and reliability.“That Gullwing is an unrestored car, so it really takes a special person [to own one],” Gooding says. “Pandemic online sales are still a new world. There is still a lot of unknown. The market is good and strong, but you can’t just be totally bullish about everything.”Remain Calm. It Was Already Happening  A market correction was bound to happen after the exuberant sales figures of 2017 and 2018. In fact, it was already happening, Hagerty analysts noted in January. Even before Covid-19 hit, Arizona Auction Week, which ended Jan. 16 in Scottsdale, Ariz., saw $244.1 million in overall sales, a 3% decrease from 2019’s $251 million tally, despite a 17% increase in the number of cars being sold. In August last year, Monterey car week suffered similar declines, with sales totals across all auctions lagging behind 2018 results by 34%, according to Hagerty.After peak years of multimillion-dollar auctions in exclusive golf clubs at Pebble Beach, Calif., and at Frank Lloyd Wright-designed hotels in Scottsdale, 2019 involved several ultra-high-net-worth speculators easing out of the collecting frenzy, which relieved some of the high-price pressure. The challenging environment for collectors has to do with the larger economy. The wave of investment dollars that flowed into collecting after the Great Recession has slowed, and tax advantages that allowed collectors to roll gains from car sales into other cars have been eliminated over the past few years.  Gooding remains sanguine. “When Pebble got canceled,” he says, “everything sped up. I’ve found that lately, people are actually more open-minded about pricing. These are clients who have a long history with us. Online or otherwise, things have a way of working out. The demand of quality cars has not faded during such uncertain times.” It seems that some people still want to kick the proverbial tire before they buy, too. Gooding just announced that its postponed “Passion of a Lifetime” sale will proceed—live—in the U.K. early in September. (Bidders unable or unwilling to travel internationally can bid via phone.) RM Sotheby’s will also hold a live sale for bidders only in Auburn, Ind., on Sept. 3-5. Bonhams will do the same on Aug. 14 in Los Angeles. Car lovers may end up the real winners on either count. If the pandemic and ensuing lockdowns have helped cool off an overheated market, being able to bid, either in real life or virtually, means they have a better chance of finding that dream lot.",

We all know sunflowers (helianthus), as they are one of the most recognizable flowers. Their brilliant color and rustic charm endear them to young and old, gardener and painter. They grace gardens and fields, blooming in the latter part of the summer. Those tall stalks not only beg our attention, but they also attract birds, butterflies and bees. I will always remember driving on a back road near Baltimore and coming across a breath-taking sight of sunflowers. The countryside was glowing with these bright, canary-yellow flowers that embellished the road for a long way. I have read and seen pictures of the fields in Italy, where you see sunflowers for miles, and I felt I was experiencing that sight.      Each August, I ask my son Will to let me know when his field of sunflowers is blooming. I like to go and just enjoy the site and to pick some for the house. I am always curious which way they will be facing when I visit his field. It is fun to watch the young flowers turn eastward at dawn to greet the sun. Then, as the sun starts to rise above the horizon, these charming flowers begin their romance with the sun as they follow it across the sky. By sunset time, they will be facing west to watch the sun disappear into the horizon. Then by morning, they are all facing east again and are ready to start again.      Sunflowers come in many different colors and sizes. There are the tall ones that come to mind when someone mentions sunflowers. There are also medium- sized ones that grow to about 4 or 5 feet. Today, you can even get dwarf varieties that are quite charming, only growing to about 2 feet tall. Their colors have a wide range of hues too, going from brilliant yellow to rust, brown and amber and shades in-between.      There are also sunflowers that are continuous bloomers. This spring, I was visiting nurseries as I usually do, mask on and keeping a distance of course; I was introduced to some new plants as I roamed the isles. I always want to see what the different garden centers bring in to sell and to see which plants are the most popular.      On my ventures to nurseries, two new annual sunflowers caught my attention. The first one was named SunBelievable or Brown Eyed Girl Helianthus. It has the happy face of a sunflower with multi-branching and dwarf in size. SunBelievable has golden yellow petals that become reddish-brown towards the base and they blend well into a dark brown center. This plant does not produce seed, putting all of its energy into making a constant crop of flowers. They are cheerful looking in the container and I was told that they bloomed all summer long. I was keen to give this plant a try.      When I purchased them, they had a few blooms and I assumed as the plant grew, I would see more. They have looked nice all summer, but now they are about to explode with even more blooms. I was content with the number I was getting, but in a week, I will have a bush with even more flowers covering the plant at a time when other flowers are starting to fade.      Shortly after finding SunBelievable, I was visiting another nursery and I spotted another dwarf sunflower that was bright, clear yellow. It was named Sunfinity. This plant was about 18 inches tall with yellow, daisy-looking flowers that were quite cheerful looking. This plant was developed to give the home gardener colorful, long-lasting sunflower looking blooms that are smaller and bloom over several months. Sunfinity was created to have many stems with a multitude of blooms to flower all season long. This was a unique and different way to look at sunflowers. They do not have the large heads of what I think of as traditional sunflowers - the bloom is only about 3 inches wide. However, the number of blooms and the length of time they have flowers make up for the size.      There are companies that specialize in all the new and exciting sunflowers and catalogs to tempt you. You can save your seeds, but remember that cross- pollination could have occurred and you might not get a flower that is exactly like the one you collected seed from.

Setting time slots for the elderly vote is an unconstitutional and "absolutely insulting" measure, Chairman of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats (ALDE) Calin Popescu-Tariceanu, who runs for Bucharest Mayor, said on Thursday.
 "Step by step, (President, ed. n.) Iohannis and (Prime minister, ed. n.) Orban implement the plan to rig the elections. Yesterday, the Government sent Parliament a plan to set time intervals for the vote of the elderly. Just like they did during the state of emergency, two hours and on the run. I have no doubt that the measure is absolutely unconstitutional, but, more seriously, it is absolutely insulting. It is the solution that Iohannis and Orban have found to neutralize the discontent of pensioners after their refusal to increase their pensions according to the law. And since 5 million votes matter, they invented this tricky thing which they put a tassel onto - body temperature measurement at the entrance to the polling station," Tariceanu wrote on Facebook.

Macau has taken its first steps on the road to recovery as the casino capital starts issuing tourist visas again.
 Asia's gambling hub became a ghost town after coronavirus lockdowns saw a severe downturn in visitors.
 Macau authorities said they will slowly start handing out tourist visas from Wednesday to bring gamblers back.
 Casino operators have been losing $15m (£11.5m) daily in expenses, according to estimates.
 Visas for both individuals and group tours from mainland China will be restored in phases. Macau, like Hong Kong, is a special administrative region (SAR) of China.
 Authorities did not say when visas will be made available to tourists wanting to travel to Macau from outside China.
 Macau's neighbour Zhuhai is the first mainland city to be issued tourist visas. The opportunity will gradually be rolled out to the rest of the country during August and September, according to a statement from China's National Immigration Administration.
 Casino operators are excited by the relaxation of the travel ban, which was introduced in late January to contain the spread of the coronavirus. Their revenues are typically five times that of the Las Vegas Strip, driven largely by Chinese demand.
 On top of the re-issuing of visas, a two-week quarantine imposed on Macau travellers upon their return to mainland China was lifted across the country on Wednesday.
 Macau has seen a very low level of coronavirus infections with just 46 cases and no deaths.
 In the red
 Macau's economy is heavily reliant on the tourism and gaming industry, which shrank 49% in the first quarter of this year.
 While casino operators were permitted to reopen after a 15-day shutdown in February, the world's biggest gambling hub was virtually deserted as no tourists were allowed in.
 Visitors from mainland China make up more than 90% of Macau's tourists, which is home to major casino operators including Sands, Wynn, Galaxy and MGM.
 Investment bank Morgan Stanley has warned casinos in Macau could rack up losses of $1bn over the April to June quarter.
 Visitor numbers for the first half of the year are down 84% compared to 2019. BBC

He was not able to say how many students would be randomly tested each day, but the process will be pool testing. That means groups of samples will be tested together. If it comes back negative, there will be no need for further testing. But if a pool test comes back positive, officials can then dig deeper, isolate the samples for more testing and track down those who may be positive for coronavirus. The process allows the university to test more people quickly.

Odisha FC has signed former India international Steven Dias as the new assistant coach of the team ahead of the seventh season of the Indian Super League.
 The 36-year-old former attacking mid-fielder has joined on a one-year deal, the club said in a statement.
 After drawing curtains on his playing career with the national team and clubs like Air India, Mahindra United, Churchill Brothers, Delhi Dynamos, and Mumbai FC, Dias had joined Jamshedpur FC as its assistant coach last year.
 Odisha FC has also brought back Spanish strength and conditioning coach Joan Casanova for the upcoming season.
 “Steven has a successful playing career and the players look up to him. He will be a valuable asset for us while he develops as a coach,” Odisha FC head coach Stuart Baxter said.
 “Joan gives us continuity and the players are comfortable with him and we are on the same page concerning football conditioning and recuperation,” he added.
 Dias was delighted with his new assignment.
 “The club’s forward thinking vision of developing young Indian talent was a major factor in determining my decision to become a part of the project,” he said.
 On his return to Odisha FC and Indian football, Casanova said, “I am happy to be back at Odisha FC and work in the ISL. Last season we had so many challenges.”
 “We hope in the upcoming season, we can compete as good as the last one and get inside the playoffs which is the goal for the club.”

It's 20 years since Naomi Klein's bestseller No Logo brought the idea of sweatshops and branding to the masses. It highlighted how on the one hand brands and celebrities are used to sell factory 'lifestyles' through mass products that are for the most part manufactured in second and third world countries. On the other, large corporations used their dominance to dictate what we buy through curtailing what is on our supermarket shelves and dictating to those who want to get on their shelves how much they will be paid for it.And while manufacturing jobs moved to cheaper production regions, all helping achieve economies of scale, jobs in the western world were turning into the 'McJob'.Perhaps the most sinister part of her book revealed that the exodus of manufacturing jobs led to an influx of jobs in the service sector with minimum wage and little benefits for workers.Meanwhile, the lifestyle we consumers are all buying up, through fast fashion and fast food, are all showcased on ­Instagram.But, the chances are that top you're boasting about on Insta only costing €3 was probably made by in a country with no labour laws… by a child.But consumers don't want to know. Fast fashion is not just acceptable; it's a post on Instagram so be proud of it!The target market for fast-fashion companies is young women looking for cheap clothing and the reality of how these clothes are produced at low cost is not something most consumers want to be made aware of - there are far more fashionable causes to champion. The same has been happening in the food sector for years as the price of food is driven down by retailers, manufacturers and consumers and it's only been highlighted through clusters of Covid in meat plants as we see and hear there is a price to be paid.Cheap-food policies are economically unsustainable for a first world society and do little but cheapen the value we put on our food.Celebrity restaurateur Nick Munier was charging €25 for a burger in his Dublin restaurant venture a few years ago, but even that Instagrammable novelty couldn't last.But why is a burger not worth €25 if it's made with prime steak mince? A steak, with no chips, will cost upwards of €25 in a Dublin restaurant. But that's OK, a steak is a steak, hand massaged in Wagu fashion no doubt, fed organic feed, no doubt, all detailed on the menu to convince us we're buying into the lifestyle we want and deserve.Nowhere does it mention the steak was cut from a carcass on a factory line, in near- freezing conditions by a migrant worker who has trained for two years to be skilled enough not to remove a finger in the process?At ground level, many of today's farmers are struggling to make a viable living from the sector when around them the food industry has become dominated by roughly 10 companies, which own the majority of foods we consume and decide what we eat and who provides it.Fundamentally, farmers produce food, but global food companies who make huge profits, determine the price farmers and others along the food chain pay and receive. Farming is the start of the food chain, but farmers have the least influence.Is it any surprise? When we as consumers are driven by special offers in supermarkets and loss leaders on food? All the research points to our Instagram lives - we say we want to buy Irish and support local farmers, but once we step inside the shop door we're straight to the special offers and don't think twice about how a piece of meat or top can cost so little.And those special offers on spring lamb and beef serve no one but the retailers and processors. Farmers are producing at below cost, so processors and retailers can ensure consumers feel they are getting great value. But at what cost further back the food chain?A leg of lamb may seem expensive to the consumer at €30 in the supermarket, but the farmer probably received less than €90 for the entire lamb. Those Christmas deals that see vegetables selling for a few cents are loss leaders for supermarkets, but more importantly it removes any value in the eyes of the ­consumers.It's a race to the bottom and those who will bear the brunt of it are the farmers and sectoral workers. The power and decision to buy sustainable food lies in the hands of the consumer. But if we keep expecting the price of our food to be as low as possible all we're doing is driving down the price farmers and workers are receiving, for it's not the profits of the processors and retailers that will be impacted.The less we appreciate the value of food the less our farmers and workers continue to earn.Well done us.

“I don’t know if it’s correct to say that we were deficient (in our coronavirus countermeasures),” said Takehara, “but we recognize that, for example, after eating, some people may have left their masks off for a little while. We’re taking extreme measures (to eliminate close contact).
 "When the players take off their masks, it isn’t for a long time, and in the locker room they were always wearing their masks. The lockers have been divided into three areas and there was still a cluster infection.”
 Three Tosu staffers were identified as having had close contact with Kim; they were among the 89 players and officials tested Tuesday but were eventually found not to be infected.
 While other J. League clubs have publicly announced the names of those infected, Sagan declined to do so in its announcement and Takehara said he did not expect to do so in the future. The J. League’s coronavirus guidelines do not mandate that teams reveal the identities of those infected with the virus.
 “Out of consideration for those involved and in order to protect their personal information, we won’t be announcing their names,” Takehara said. “We hope that the rights of the infected and their families will be respected.”
 Wednesday’s cup tie was the third J. League game to be postponed as a result of infected players and the second involving Sanfrecce, whose July 26 J1 fixture against Nagoya Grampus was pushed back after two Nagoya players and two staffers were infected and additional contact tracing could not be completed before kickoff.
 With both Sanfrecce and Sagan having been eliminated from the Levain Cup through other results in Wednesday’s final round of group stage games, the J. League could decide not to reschedule the fixture.
 “I’m very sorry to our fans who were looking forward to this game,” Sanfrecce chairman Shingo Senda said Wednesday. “Having to cancel a second game on the day of has caused a lot of trouble for (our supporters). We hope that everyone infected at Sagan Tosu recovers quickly.”
 Responding to Wednesday’s news, Antlers announced that they had not discovered any incidents of close contact between Kim and Kashima officials and that facilities at Kashima Soccer Stadium had been professionally disinfected as precaution.

Ozzy Osbourne's upcoming biopic will be for adults only says wife Sharon.
 The rocker's manager wife, who is helping to develop the film with the couple's son Jack, reveals the project will be R-rated, because no one wants to water down the former Black Sabbath star's crazy life.
 "It’s not like any other story," she says to Rolling Stone. "It’s not like, 'rock & roll, crazy, and now I’m a granddad!' It's so much more than that."
 Sharon insists Ozzy's biopic will be nothing like Bohemian Rhapsody, which chronicled the lives of Freddie Mercury and his Queen bandmates.
 "I get why they did that, because it was for a younger generation," she says. "It was squeaky clean... and it turned a whole generation onto Queen’s music that had never heard (it) before. So with that, it was phenomenal. But I don’t think it was a great movie... It was made 'nice' and that’s what made it a Hallmark movie.
 "Our film will be a lot more real. We don’t want it to be squeaky, shiny clean and all of that. We’re not making it for kids. It’s an adult movie for adults.
 "I hope it will be a story that everybody can relate to. You don't have to be a fan of the music, because it’s a story about a survivor. No matter what life throws at you, you pick yourself up and you start again. It’s just an amazing story of overcoming everything that’s thrown at you in your life."
 Meanwhile, Jack tells the music magazine the project already has a writer on board.
 "We said to go from 1979 to 1996. I can't say too much, but the film is an active development," he adds.
 And Ozzy shares what he knows about the story.
 "From what I understand, it’s about (wife and manager) Sharon and I and our relationship; it’s how we met, fell in love, and how we married. She’s my other half. She grew up a lot with me, and I grew up a lot with her... Sharon wants to get an unknown actor (to portray me)," he says.
 Meanwhile, Ozzy's life will also be the subject of an upcoming TV documentary, Biography: The Nine Lives of Ozzy Osbourne, which Jack produced. It will premiere on America's A&E; network on 7 September.
