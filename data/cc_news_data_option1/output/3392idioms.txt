The Champaign woman had pleaded guilty in June to aggravated driving under the influence in the September 2019, crash in Champaign.
 Assistant State’s Attorney Brooke Hinman said Marshall drove through construction barriers onto a bridge being rebuilt over Interstate 57 before her car vaulted down the embankment onto the highway’s west side. It was stopped by a concrete barrier before entering I-57′s southbound lanes.
