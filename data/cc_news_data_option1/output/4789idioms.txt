On the price chart, a worrying bearish flag is forming in shares. Yeah, this isn't going to appeal to any growth-oriented, cup-with-handle investors. Having said that, and as to avoid the flag pattern's promised kiss of death, buying a modestly out-of-the-money bull call spread rather than long stock, looks like appropriate exposure in FROG.

FLETCHER - With stuffed animals and other Christmas gifts strapped to their machines, more than 500 motorcyclists roared out of Bill Moore Community Park Saturday as another Henderson County Toy Run got underway.
   
 The 23rd annual parade to benefit children in foster care - organized by the Christian Motorcyclists Association and the Hendersonville office of the state Department of Social Services - continued along Main Street in Hendersonville before ending at the County Courthouse, where hundreds of toys were arranged for display on the courthouse steps.
   
 The spectacle of 500 bikers being led through town by Hendersonville Police Department and Sheriff's Office vehicles caught downtown visitors off guard, including Lisa Danciu of Asheville, who was enjoying a beautiful fall day with her family.
   
 "That was amazing - unbelievable," she said after the noise from loud mufflers and honking horns subsided. "It was so random; we just happened to be here. It was perfect."
   
 Crystal Harris, a CMA organizer and former foster care parent, was ecstatic about the turnout, especially given the COVID-19 pandemic.
   
 "With the year the way it's been, we didn't know what it was going to be like," Harris said. "We didn't even know if we'd even have a Toy Run."
   
 But, she said, "We sold out of food, we sold out of T-shirts and people bought all the auction items. It was amazing, and the main thing is we got so many toys for children who need them."
   
 Harris also appreciated the support of local businesses.
   
 "Even though it's been a rough year for everybody, we had over 70 sponsors," she said. "So many people stepped up; I think it's a wonderful thing."
   
 A young lady helping out at Saturday's run couldn't agree more.
   
 "I'm really thankful they're doing this," said 15-year-old Sarah, a foster child whose real name isn't being used to protect her privacy. "Most kids (in foster care) don't get a Christmas. They'll be really happy."
   
 Sarah also talked about the way teachers and administrators at her school "noticed something was off," and took her aside to talk about her home life - which she described as "unsuitable" because of unsanitary conditions and neglectful parents.
   
 Her situation worsened after both parents were hospitalized, and she entered into foster care in October of 2017.
   
 "Actually, it's really great," the outgoing teen said of her second set of foster parents. "But hopefully, a family member or someone will adopt me."
   
 Libby Myers, a program manager at DSS in Hendersonville, said Sarah is one of 166 children in foster care in Henderson County, many of whom were removed from homes where domestic violence and substance abuse placed them in danger.
   
 Neglect also is a main reason children find their way into state custody, Myers said.
   
 "Chronic neglect is the hardest thing for them to deal with," she said. "We have a lot of needs to fill," including caring for children who are separated from their siblings while in foster care.
   
 "No matter what has happened (at home), that's the hardest thing for them to deal with," Myers said.
   
 Harris, who fostered more than 25 children in a six-year period and at one time had four kids living in her house in addition to her daughter, knows how painful life can be - physically and emotionally - for abused children.
   
 She recalled a time when she received a call from DSS at 1 a.m., asking her if she would take in a child whose arm had been broken.
   
 "It's so sad what they have to go through," Harris said. "There's the home situation, and then, when they're in foster care, they miss their parents. It's really hard when the parents leave (approved or supervised) visits. It's heartbreaking."
   
 With her fostering days behind her, Harris has turned her attention to the annual toy run, which is almost as rewarding.
   
 "It's wonderful to see all those motorcycles going down the road in a parade with toys on their motorcycles," she said. "It's really, really neat to see so many people who care."
   
 This year's run was dedicated to four people who died in 2020, including Henderson County Sheriff's Office deputy Ryan Hendrix, who was killed in the line of duty, and Lt. Terry "Elvi" Foster, who died of a heart attack at home.
   
 Foster's wife, Arline, who helped with numerous toy runs, succumbed to cancer shortly after her husband died, and Mark Quinn, Harris' cousin who had served as president of the CMA and helped with at least 15 toy runs, also passed away.
   
 Family members of the deceased rode in Sheriff's Office cars at the head of Saturday's parade.

EL PASO, Texas (KFOX) - As El Paso’s healthcare workers give their all in the struggle against COVID-19, hospitals are getting some much- needed help from the military.“We are dealing with a pandemic unlike any other,” Air Force Staff Sgt. Blake Pfaff said.With El Paso hospitals and ICUs over capacity since last month due to one of the worst COVID-19 surges in the country, three Air Force medical teams have spent the past two weeks deployed to aid in the fight.“We came over here to University Medical Center. We onboarded here with medical staff who showed us around the hospital. After that, we hit the ground running and started working in some of the critical care sections and emergency medicine rooms,” Pfaff said.He is a member of the team at UMC, where the COVID-19 ICU is drawing comparisons to a war zone.“A lot of the people I work with have described it similar to Afghanistan, Iraq. There’s just a large amount of patients that were taking care of and a lot of critically sick patients,” Pfaff said.El Paso has seen a wave of deaths among COVID-19 patients that has overwhelmed the county morgue, with the county having to call in the National Guard to work through a backlog of nearly 240 bodies.The Air Force teams say they’re taking pride in the patients they have been able to save.“We do have some patients unfortunately losing their lives,” Pfaff said. “But I’d rather focus on the patients we are taking care of, the ones that we are able to take off the emergency ventilators.”Although members of the military are often called heroes for their service, the medical teams say the spotlight belongs on the healthcare workers who have been saving lives in El Paso since the pandemic began.“They’re the real heroes. Were just here in support of them,” Pfaff said.Copyright 2020 KFOX via CNN Newsource. All rights reserved.

He recalled that, in his early days after leaving NYU, those decisions could not be taken lightly. “When I [first] started filming, I was filming in 16mm, so everything was so precious and so heavy. To capture 10 minutes was a huge amount of work. It was also very expensive.” Surprisingly, however, that doesn’t mean that Rosi plans his shoots. “When I start any project,” he admitted, “I never know where it’s going. When I started “Boatman,” when I started “Below Sea Level” (2008), when I started “El Sicario…” (2010), when I started “Sacro GRA” (2013), when I started “Fire at Sea” (2016), when I started “Notturno,” it was a very small, tiny idea. [It] started with very few pages. And then those few pages became the film, at the end of a long, long journey, which lasted three years in case of “Notturno,” and in the case of “Boatman” five years. “El Sicario…” was only three days of shooting, but, when I put the camera down, I never know what’s going to happen in front of me. And this is what I think I love about documentary.”
