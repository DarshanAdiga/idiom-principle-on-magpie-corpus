"We have made some major strides," she said.
 The competition for the command is driven by economics. The Trump administration has placed a major emphasis on military space programs, creating the command to oversee combat in orbit and creating Space Force, a separate armed service for satellite troops.
 The command will have billions of dollars in defense contracts to offer and whatever city gets it will be home to the nation's military space industry for decades to come.
 The command is small, around 1,000 troops. But it will have an annual budget that could hit $20 billion in the coming years as the military ups investments in new satellites.
 Jay Lindell, Gov. Jared Polis' top advisor for aerospace issues, said winning the command is crucial for the state's future.
 "We are the epicenter for space," he said, noting Colorado is the nation's No. 2 space economy, behind California.
 Colorado Springs U.S. Rep. Doug Lamborn, a Republican who sits on the House Armed Services Committee, said he has personally pushed Trump and Air Force leaders to keep the command in Colorado Springs and to announce a decision quickly.
 Having politics come into play was almost expected he said. But the length of the deliberations, which could push a decision on the command that was due last summer past the November election has Lamborn irked.
 Without a basing decision, leaders can't make long-term plans for the command, and troops who serve in the command are left to wonder where they will live next year.
 "The whole reason for Space Command is that threat is growing," Lamborn said, noting that Russia and China, America's rivals in orbit, aren't pausing their efforts while U.S. officials ponder where to place the command.
 And without the Space Symposium, where Lamborn planned to continue lobbying leaders and wooing reporters, Colorado Springs will need to find new ways to earn the command.
 "We're highlighting and showcasing Colorado Springs as a center of space excellence," Lamborn said.
 Retired Gen. Lance Lord, who headed the military's space efforts in the mid 2000s, said the key for Colorado Springs is to keep up the pressure.
 "We caught the bus," Lord said. "Now we just need to ride it home."

Some health professionals, however, claim the initiative involves mere cost shifting.
 GPs and others delivering the telehealth service must bulk bill.
 Patients accessing the service, because they don't want to attend a surgery for fear of contracting COVID-19, ordinarily would have paid a full fee but now will be bulk billed.
 As a result, frontline medicos and other health professionals who charge in excess of the Medicare rebate could find themselves out of pocket during a health crisis, impacting their ability to pay staff.
 The cost shifting occurs because the patient would have gone to the doctor anyway and incurred a Medicare rebate.
 Now, because they are teleconferencing, it will be billed as part of the COVID-19 response budget.
 Whatever the merits of their argument, it seems inconceivable that frontline medical practitioners facing an onslaught have been tasked with picking up the tab on what appears to be an already slim budget outlay for such a crisis.

BOSTON -- Massachusetts gaming regulators and its licensees agreed to a two- week shutdown of the state's slots parlor and two resorts casinos Saturday and are working to finalize the plan as state government takes serious steps to try to staunch the spread of the coronavirus that's infected 123 people in the state.
 Gaming operations are expected to cease by late Saturday night and other operations at the casinos -- hotels, restaurants, clubs and retail shops -- would have to shut down by Sunday under the plan the commission authorized its staff to put into writing for final approval. Another meeting is expected to finalize the plan.
 Casino operators said they would need some time to ensure the closures are orderly and safe, and to re-book overnight guests at other hotels.
 The Mass. Gaming Commission held an emergency meeting via conference call at 10 a.m. Saturday to discuss the "operational status of gaming licensees in light of the coronavirus." Representatives from Plainridge Park Casino in Plainville, MGM Springfield and Encore Boston Harbor in Everett participated in the call and each business said it was fully on board with the commission's action.
 Commission staffers said discussions around the plan were collaborative with the casino companies and evolved over the last few weeks. Interim Executive Director Karen Wells said the licensees agreed to "an orderly closure from the commission."
 Brian Gullbrants, president of Encore Boston Harbor, said he thinks it is "prudent at this time to pause our operations." A representative of MGM Springfield said the company is "fully supportive of whatever your decision may be."
 The change will have economic impacts on the state's coffers, and the pocketbooks of the thousands of people who have found jobs in the relatively young Massachusetts gaming world. All three companies pledged during Saturday's meeting to pay its full-time employees during the two-week shutdown.
 The commission is due to publish February revenue figures on Monday, but the state can typically rely on about $21 million in monthly revenue from its three gambling halls.
 Commissioner Eileen O'Brien called the decision "the only prudent thing to do" given the public health emergency.
 "I agree that we need to be better safe than sorry," commissioner Enrique Zuniga said.
 The commission said its operations staff will coordinate with the casinos to figure out the fine details of the "orderly closure" and expects to hold another meeting this weekend to discuss those details.
 All three facilities said they expect to maintain a small team of staff -- management and security, mostly -- during the closures.
 Around the country, other states have shut down or limited casino operations as American society adjusts to social distancing in a public health emergency.
 Illinois on Friday suspended riverboat casino operations and Ohio ordered its gaming facilities to either close or keep the number of customers and workers present below 100.
 On Friday, Gov. Charlie Baker banned most gatherings of 250 people or more, the Catholic Church in Boston suspended Masses until further notice and many local school systems have canceled classes for at least a week. In Boston's case, schools will likely be closed until late April.
 Sporting events, concerts, theater performances and conferences have been called off. A massive chunk of the state's workforce is adjusting to working remotely and state agencies like the Gaming Commission are operating in uncharted waters.
 Saturday morning's unusual virtual emergency meeting was made possible by the fact that Baker last week suspended parts of the Open Meeting Law in an attempt to allow government to function without putting people in physical proximity of one another.
 The commission posted a public notice of the meeting - including the dial-in information for any member of the public who wanted to "attend" the meeting - around 11 p.m. Friday.

To improve its economies, the culture of good governance cannot be seen as a distant luxury to be aspired to but avoided in practice. To boost economic development all important cultural values must be in place and must be governed by transparency, accountability, trustworthiness and empowerment.

The singer is not the only celebrity concerned they may have contracted coronavirus. Last week, _America's Got Talent_ judge Heidi Klum fell ill, and she revealed on Saturday she recently took a test. While she awaits the results, Klum is self-quarantining, even keeping herself apart from husband Tom Kaulitz.
 "Like many of you, I also have been sick all week and, unfortunately, my husband who returned from his tour a couple of days ago is also feeling ill," Klum shared on Instagram. "To be safe, we are staying apart until we get the results of our Coronavirus tests (that we were finally able to get today) back. We don't want to spread germs and risk others getting sicker... even each other! As much as I want to embrace him and kiss him, it is more important to do the right thing and not spread further."
 Some celebrities already know they have coronavirus. Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson are now in quarantine at a hospital in Australia after they tested positive.
 "Hello folks. [Wilson] and I want to thank everyone here Down Under who are taking such good care of us," Hanks wrote on Instagram Friday. "We have Covid-19 and are in isolation so we do not spread it to anyone else. There are those for whom it could lead to a very serious illness. We are taking it one- day-at-a-time. There are things we can all do to get through this by following the advice of experts and taking care of ourselves and each other, no? Remember, despite all the current events, there is no crying in baseball."
 Meanwhile in Canada, Sophie Trudeau, the wife of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, also tested positive. The couple self-quarantined, with the PM working from home. His office said she is the only one in the family showing symptoms, reports _Fox News_.

 "Although I'm experiencing uncomfortable symptoms of the virus, I will be back on my feet soon," Sophie said in a statement. "Being in quarantine at home is nothing compared to other Canadian families who might be going through this and for those facing more serious health concerns."

After a recent OPEC meeting, neither the Russians nor Saudis could agree on oil production quotas. As such, the two energy nations decided to flood the market with oil. Although this created immense volatility, it is not entirely good or bad.
 The bad aspect is that it puts immense pressure on oil commodities. Prices for crude fell 24% in one day. Even stalwart energy companies like Exxon were down double digits.
 Make no mistake; this is not a feud between Russia and Saudi Arabia. Rather, it is an attempt to drive energy prices down such that U.S. shale producers cannot stay in business. This is a dangerous proposition for energy producers around the world.
 Many investors are using this as an opportunity to chase after what appears to be unbelievable dividend yields. A word to the wise–if it looks too good to be true, it usually is.
 Prior to the current decline in oil, Exxon paid $3.43 in dividends per share despite the fact that they only earned $3.36 per share. As such, they were going into debt just to support their dividend. This is a foolish business decision. Not only does increasing debt make Exxon riskier, but it means they probably are not reinvesting into their production and equipment.
 Exxon’s current dividend yield is more than 8%. However, it is a mirage. Exxon’s earnings will fall putting even greater pressure on the energy company to either cut their dividend or go further into debt to fund their dividend.
 Occidental Petroleum has already announced they are slashing their dividend by 86% and reducing their capital expenditures. Surely, they will not be the last.
 Russia’s leader, Vladimir Putin, is smart and cunning. He knows that oil is a commodity which primarily trades on the basis of supply and demand. Quick swings in supply create volatility. Putin is seizing upon this to create as much chaos as possible.
 Putin also knows that most companies in the energy sector are highly leveraged (have borrowed lots of money). Furthermore, the majority of companies operating in the energy sector are characterized as “junk” or high-yield debt. They are at the lowest rungs of the credit ladder. This puts individual companies at risk for financial troubles when oil drops. It is quite possible that many of these heavily leveraged companies may go into a restructuring or go out of business entirely.
 Of the $15 billion in high-yield deals in 2020 so far, roughly two-thirds came from energy companies. Additionally, there is more than $55 billion of energy related debt maturing in the next three years.
 Putin senses a moment of weakness and is attempting to exploit this to the best of his abilities. The combination of these factors makes it incredibly difficult to invest in the energy sector.
 On the positive side, the drop in oil lowers the cost of gasoline, electricity, paint, plastic, carpet, and at least 70 other major products. Being as 70% of Gross Domestic Product comes from consumer spending, lower oil costs is like giving an immediate tax credit to every American family.
 Putin is not the only one hoping for volatility. The other villain you are battling is our own financial markets. Very little of the stock market volatility is driven by individual trading. Instead, it is driven by Wall Street based computers. This causes significant volume in stock trading and erratic movements.
 We know these computers are hyper-focused on short-term trading with little consideration for the long game.
 It is worth understanding that even in a world that appears to offer low- commission or no-commission trading, there are still many trading costs. Each time a trade is placed, there are bid-ask spreads. This means that any time a security is traded, the buy order is placed at one price while simultaneously the sell order is at a slightly lower price. In a normal orderly market, the spread is quite small.
 In a volatile market, the spread widens and Wall Street rejoices. Wall Street loves the trading on the way down and the way up. No matter which way the market is going, the more volatility the better for Wall Street.
 Knowing this, if you allow your emotions to get the best of you, Wall Street will take advantage every time. Be a long-term investor who trades as little as possible. The easiest way to win Wall Streets game is not to play at all.

It was a routine game of schoolyard tag -- except the children had dubbed this version "coronavirus." The kids ran around and tagged one another, but instead of being "it," they "caught" the virus.
 Children like the ones a reporter saw playing recently at a school in Washington, D.C., are becoming more aware of the coronavirus -- though they may not fully understand it or know how seriously to take it -- as it begins to affect their daily lives with school closures and event cancellations, restrictions on travel, and the NBA nixing the rest of its season.
 Many parents are now deciding how to talk to their children about the virus. Some said they are checking in daily, while others worry talking about it could make their kids more anxious or fearful.
 "We talk about it a lot. I watch the news every morning, and they're always watching it, too," said Nicole Poponi, mother of Clara, 10, and Jane, 12, in the Philadelphia suburb of Audubon, New Jersey.
 Both girls said they've talked a little about the virus at school, but Jane, who is a few grades ahead, said she has talked about it much more, including in science lessons.
 "I'm not really as scared of it. It's still not even that many people getting sick here. And it's less dangerous than the flu," Jane said. "One of my friends is really scared of it, but she's honestly really scared of all diseases."
 Beth Young, who lives in Fort Mill, South Carolina, said she has decided to limit the conversation with her four kids, ages 8, 10, 12 and 15.
 "I don't want to doom and gloom them into being afraid of getting sick because, let's face it, kids get sick pretty often," she said. "And I don't need a sniffle to turn into them worrying about dying."
 For most people -- including children -- the new coronavirus, which causes a disease called COVID-19, results in only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For others, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.
 The vast majority of people recover. According to the World Health Organization, which has declared the outbreak a pandemic, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover.
 Child psychology experts' advice is to be reassuring, focus on proactive steps and do research to truthfully answer children's questions.
 In Kathleen McEvoy's house in Norton, Massachusetts, she and her husband, Thom Daly, decided they wanted to talk with their 8-year-old daughter, Kennedy, before something like a quarantine or school closure was announced.
 "We thought it would be confusing and scary for a kid if they were told that school has to be closed for two weeks," McEvoy said. "We felt like it was important ... to give her a lot of information about how this might impact her life even if we don't know exactly how yet."
 McEvoy, 38, works as a paraprofessional at a different school district and said some second-graders had talked about how they thought the virus was spread. Some thought they could catch it from eating Chinese food or from touching bats or pigs.
 The teacher spent some time searching for an age-appropriate video to help them understand how the virus is actually spread, McEvoy said.
 It's important to reassure children, to ask whether they have questions and to stress safety, said Dr. Jamie Howard, a clinical psychologist at the nonprofit Child Mind Institute. The institute and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention both offer tips on talking to children.
 Some teachers and coaches are working to dispel any idea that the virus, which was first recorded in China, is tied to ethnicity or race.
 Seattle Public Schools posted on its website that misinformation has led to fear and hostility, and it urged students to combat racism and bias.
 "We are aware of reports that some of our Asian students have been targeted and discriminated against in connection to COVID-19. This is unacceptable and contrary to our values of racial equity and social justice," district leaders wrote.
 Lacy Hilbrich's two daughters, ages 14 and 18, are part of an online school that has students from all over the world. They live near Houston, but some of her daughters' classmates are in countries where there are quarantines in place.
 The virus, she said, has been part of her family's daily discussion.
 "In our family we all talk about it, so it's pretty open and so they're not hiding anything from us," said daughter Ally, 14. "And I think that's helped a lot."
 Parents should explain that measures like wearing face masks and closing schools are preventative and temporary, Howard said. She urged them to take a page from Mr. Rogers, who taught kids to "focus on the helpers" -- what doctors, teachers, parents and scientists are doing to keep them safe.
 Whatever the conversation looks like, Howard said, parents should not collude in their child's anxiety by refusing to go outside or by buying masks.
 "In doing those behaviors, you're saying this is really dangerous and we really are in danger right now," she said. "And that's not true, and it will make them more anxious."
