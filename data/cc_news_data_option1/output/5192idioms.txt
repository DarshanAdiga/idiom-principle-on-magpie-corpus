Some never-Trump leaders said their biggest potential impact is within the Biden administration and the Democratic Party, not the GOP. They’re looking to leverage friendships they’ve forged within Biden’s circle to pull the new president toward the center — all but ensuring he will be squeezed by the left and right. Biden’s coalition included a record number of crossover endorsements from past Republican officials at all levels of government [....]

COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — In his farewell speech to Congress on Thursday, freshman U.S. Rep. Joe Cunningham of South Carolina made it one for the road, cracking open a can of beer in a toast to his fellow members in a sign-off of his brief tenure. “For the betterment of this country, we have to come together, we have to sit down and listen to each other, and maybe even have a beer,” Cunningham, a Democrat, said, reaching into his suit jacket and pulling out a can. “In the spirit of bipartisanship, of cooperation, I raise this glass to my colleagues, both Democrats and Republicans.\" In his remarks, Cunningham also called out politicians who “consistently put their party ahead of their own people,” a reflection on his “Lowcountry over Party” campaign slogan. “I’ve been trying to work with people since the first day I got here,\" said Cunningham, who has received plaudits from several groups for his bipartisan work, also noting that President Donald Trump has signed two of his bills into law. “The other side is not the enemy.” It wasn’t the first time Cunningham - who made brewery stops throughout the 1st District part of his campaign routine - has involved beer in his official duties. In 2019, the freshman was stopped from bringing a six-pack of beer onto the House floor because alcohol is prohibited. At the time, Cunningham said he was trying to give a collection of South Carolina brews to U.S. Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Oregon, co-chairman of the House’s Small Brewer’s Caucus. Cunningham’s 2018 flip of the coastal district from red to blue placed the area, which runs from Charleston to Beaufort, in Democratic hands for the first time in decades. He lost his bid for a second term to Republican Nancy Mace in November as a Republican wave of victories through the state recaptured the 1st District...

RENO, Nev. (AP) — A 26-year-old Lake Tahoe man has been charged with murder in the strangulation of a Sparks woman whose body was found near a crashed car on the Mount Rose Highway in the middle of the night in September. Alexandrew Vail of Kings Beach, California was being held without bail Thursday in the Washoe County Jail in Reno. He’s accused of killing 27-year- old Emily Giudici on Sept. 15. The Washoe County Sheriff’s Office says Vail was arrested that day after an off-duty officer noticed a single-vehicle crash on his way home from work just after 2 a.m. on the mountain highway that connects Reno to Lake Tahoe. The officer found Guidici’s body outside the car. Vail initially was charged with driving under the influence and without a license. The Washoe County Medical Examiner’s Office later ruled the death was a homicide by strangulation. Vail was charged Wednesday with open murder. It’s not clear if he has a lawyer or will be appointed one at a pending court appearance.

BOISE, Idaho — More Americans plan to celebrate the holidays at home rather than hit the road this holiday season. AAA projects that holiday travel will drop by at least 29 percent from a year ago as COVID-19 restrictions motivate three-quarters of Americans to celebrate at home. That means nearly 35 million fewer travelers will hit the road or head to the airport this year.      According to AAA's latest projection, as many as 84.5 million Americans will journey 50 miles or more from home over the holiday travel period, which begins Dec. 23 and ends Jan. 3, 2021.

(AP) - President-elect Joe Biden has picked an experienced but not widely known state regulator, Michael S. Regan of North Carolina, to lead the Environmental Protection Agency.Regan, who is head of North Carolina’s environmental agency, was one of several contenders whose name emerged only in recent days. Biden’s pick was confirmed Thursday by a person familiar with the selection process who was not authorized the discuss the matter publicly before the official announcement and spoke on condition of anonymity.California clean-air regulator Mary Nichols had faced increasing objections from progressive groups, who said Nichols had not done enough to address the disproportionate harm low-income and minority communities face from living next to oil and gas installations, factories and freeways.North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, who hired Regan for the state job, said Wednesday that Regan was “a consensus builder and a fierce protector of the environment. He’s been part of a strong, diverse cabinet in North Carolina. And if he is selected by the president-elect, I have no doubt that he will do the same kind of job for our country.”Regan became environmental chief in North Carolina in 2017. State officials there are grappling with contamination from PFAS industrial compounds and other industrial polluters.Regan points to his efforts&nbsp;to hold accountable Chemours, which is the main business blamed for the toxic PFAS pollution, and other work ranging from improving regulation of the state’s giant hog farms to releasing a plan to cut climate-damaging fossil fuel pollution from power plants by 70 percent within 10 years.He previously spent almost a decade at the federal EPA, including managing a national program for air-pollution issues.His past jobs included serving as an associate vice president for climate and energy issues at the Environmental Defense Fund advocacy group and as head of his own environmental and energy consulting firm.Regan, who is Black, has a bachelor’s degree from the North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, which is a historical black university, and a master’s from George Washington University.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

Kansas athletic director Jeff Long said Thursday the timeline for the NCAA's infractions case against KU has "has been affected" by the COVID-19 pandemic.
 "I know the NCAA has had to take pauses in their program due to COVID, but they've also had furloughs in the enforcement area during this time because of the financial crunch they've experienced," Long said in a video call with reporters.
 "I can't give you a time period that it's been delayed, a week, a month or six months, but it has been delayed," he added. "I think we are closer to getting the next step from the IARP. We'll get a timeline of what's to happen next. We are in that phase. We are waiting to receive that at this point."
 The NCAA's new Independent Accountability Resolution Process and five of its panel of 15 members are hearing the case that includes the NCAA alleging that five Level I violations were committed by both coach Bill Self and the men's basketball program.
 Long said Thursday that fans would continue to be allowed for KU basketball games through the Jan. 2 game against Texas. Up to 2,500 fans will be allowed in Allen Fieldhouse for the West Virginia game on Dec. 22 and the UT game.

Yet not all were happy with the pardon of one violent criminal, especially when the other, Porter, had been hanged.
 One local Philadelphia merchant, James Gowen, wrote Jackson that he understood the mass outpouring of sympathy and the number of signatures, but compared it to the same sympathy and signatures against Indian removal, which Jackson ignored.
 Gowen then wrote, “Far be it from me to throw any obstacle in the way of clemency, but I conceive it my duty to apprise your Excellency, that if Wilson be pardoned and Porter executed, it will produce a strong sensation among the Irish.” Gowen later claimed that Wilson was pardoned because he was native- born while Porter was Irish and so not worthy of Jackson’s time.
 Jackson’s camp released its own version of the pardon, claiming Wilson was released because “his youth and inexperience in crime, his full confession and Christian penitence, and the earnest supplications,” while Porter was the ringleader and hardened criminal.
 In the end it did not matter. Wilson actually refused the pardon, claiming it was his moral obligation to accept the punishment for his crimes.
 The case went to the Supreme Court, which ruled you cannot force a pardon on someone who refuses it. Wilson was eventually hanged, making this pardon one of the most controversial and perplexing.
 As for numbers, I don’t know yet how many Trump will pardon, but it is doubtful he will be record- setting.
 FDR, in his four terms, pardoned 2,819 individuals. In modern times, the president with the most pardons is Trump’s predecessor, President Obama. He pardoned and commuted more than 2,000.
 His most controversial was the pardon of Chelsea Manning, who had served only seven of her thirty-five years. Manning had been convicted of leaking classified military information. Advocates had been pushing for Manning’s release after attempted suicides and the military’s lack of action on Manning’s request for gender reassignment surgery. As expected, Obama’s pardon was highly criticized from the right and the military.
 Pardons can be extremely controversial and self-serving for presidents. Most wait until their last days in office to hand out the most provocative ones. The Constitution puts no parameters on pardons except for impeachment.
 Trump will probably have a few controversial ones, but, historically speaking, it will be hard to top those that have come before.
