Presieduto dal suo presidente, Fabio Talucci, si è riunito il Comitato Regionale per le Comunicazioni del Molise che ha provveduto ad approvare all’unanimità di suoi componenti una deliberazione riguardante la costituzione e la gestione di un “Osservatorio sulle fake news Coronavirus” nell’ambito del protocollo d’intesa tra lo stesso Corecom e l’Ordine dei Giornalisti del Molise, per contrastare la diffusione di notizie false soprattutto sui social che riguardano la pandemia in atto. L’Osservatorio sarà chiamato a diffondere, ogni 15 giorni, un report web, social, carta stampata e televisioni, per far conoscere quali sono le notizie false rilevate su fonti potenzialmente inaffidabili divulgate soprattutto sui social. Collaboreranno alle attività dell’Osservatorio, oltre alle strutture del Comitato e dell’Ordine, i consiglieri nazionali dello stesso Odg, Cosimo Santimone e Vincenzo Cimino. Il periodo di osservazione andrà dal mese di aprile al mese di settembre 2020. “Con questa iniziativa – ha sottolineato il presidente Fabio Talucci- il Corecom, grazie al valido contributo dell’Ordine dei Giornalisti del Molise, intende fornire il proprio contributo al contrasto della diffusione di notizie false, propagate soprattutto suoi social, che riguardano la pandemia da Covid 2019. In un momento così particolarmente difficile, come quello vissuto dalla popolazione e da tutti gli operatori dei servizi indispensabili, non possiamo permetterci di diffondere informazioni false riguardanti temi così rilevanti come quello del contagio da Covid o della gestione dell’emergenze. Notizie che poi si diffondono velocemente principalmente sui social, ma non solo, creando confusione, ansie, preoccupazioni eccessive o, al contrario, inopportune sottovalutazioni della situazione che tutti stiamo affrontando. Gli organi di informazione, e quindi i giornalisti e gli operatori impiegati, nella loro massima parte stanno meritoriamente affrontando quest’appuntamento della nostra storia agendo con serietà, professionalità e competenza. Una preziosa azione portata avanti in tandem con la comunicazione istituzionale ufficiale delle varie autorità nazionali, regionali e locali chiamate a gestire l’emergenza. Questo comune sforzo di professionalità merita di essere protetto e salvaguardato dal ‘virus’ delle fake news, che può nuocere gravemente alla pubblica opinione nella generazione di valutazioni errate sulla situazione in atto o nella formazione idee non confacenti ad una sana e diligente applicazione delle prescrizioni di sicurezza che ogni cittadino è chiamato ad attuare per il bene singolo e collettivo. Questo Osservatorio sarà uno strumento di contrasto a tale fenomeno, che ci auguriamo possa essere particolarmente efficace ed efficiente. Ringrazio pertanto il Presidente dell’Ordine dei Giornalisti del Molise Pina Petta, e tutto il suo Consiglio reginale, per aver aderito a questo progetto che riteniamo qualificante e necessario in questa particolare fase”.

It's hoped the lockdown measures will begin to ease by the summer. But don't bank on it, I say. We all want to get out and about as soon as possible and the government is eager to loosen the leash. However, a sharply-accelerating infection rate would suggest current timescales could be thrown out the window. Some 5,903 more people tested positive for the coronavirus on Sunday, soaring from 3,735 a day earlier.
