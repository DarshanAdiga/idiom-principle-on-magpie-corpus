But in the absence of that state leadership, we believe that mid-Willamette Valley schools should err on the side of public health and safety for now. The well-being of students, school employees and our communities is paramount.
 The pandemic isn’t slowing down — it actually has accelerated this summer, as Corvallis School District Superintendent Ryan Noss noted. If it was necessary to close down schools in March due to the pandemic, why in the world would we consider reopening them now?
 To be sure, we’re a bit conflicted about keeping school buildings closed. This has real financial and emotional impacts on families. In many mid-valley households, both parents and even teens help to pay the bills. But if elementary school-aged children need to learn from home, someone has to watch over them.

For release at 2 p.m. EDT July 29, 2020 The Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals. The coronavirus outbreak is causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. Following sharp declines, economic activity and employment have picked up somewhat in recent months but remain well below their levels at the beginning of the year. Weaker demand and significantly lower oil prices are holding down consumer price inflation. Overall financial conditions have improved in recent months, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. The path of the economy will depend significantly on the course of the virus. The ongoing public health crisis will weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term, and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term. In light of these developments, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent. The Committee expects to maintain this target range until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals. The Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook, including information related to public health, as well as global developments and muted inflation pressures, and will use its tools and act as appropriate to support the economy. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the stance of monetary policy, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and (more) For release at 2 p.m. EDT July 29, 2020 - 2 - inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. To support the flow of credit to households and businesses, over coming months the Federal Reserve will increase its holdings of Treasury securities and agency residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities at least at the current pace to sustain smooth market functioning, thereby fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions. In addition, the Open Market Desk will continue to offer large-scale overnight and term repurchase agreement operations. The Committee will closely monitor developments and is prepared to adjust its plans as appropriate. Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H. Powell, Chair; John C. Williams, Vice Chair; Michelle W. Bowman; Lael Brainard; Richard H. Clarida; Patrick Harker; Robert S. Kaplan; Neel Kashkari; Loretta J. Mester; and Randal K. Quarles. - 0 -

By ALAN FRAM   Associated Press  
 WASHINGTON (AP) — Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, tested positive Wednesday for the coronavirus, forcing him to abruptly cancel his plan to travel to his home state with President Donald Trump aboard Air Force One, a House Republican aide said.
 Gohmert, 66, one of the House's most conservative and outspoken members, tested positive at the White House and planned to isolate, according to the aide, who was not authorized to publicly discuss Gohmert’s test result and spoke on condition of anonymity.
 It was not immediately clear where Gohmert was after he left the White House.
 An eight-term lawmaker, Gohmert is often seen without wearing a mask. He participated in the House Judiciary Committee hearing Tuesday where Attorney General William Barr testified. Before the hearing, Gohmert was seen approaching the meeting room a few feet behind Barr, with neither man wearing a mask.
 Gohmert also voted Tuesday on the House floor.
 He is at least the 10th member of Congress known to have tested positive for the coronavirus, which can cause COVID-19.

Con la presente la Segreteria Interni interviene per chiarire alcune inesattezze contenute nel comunicato stampa della FPI USL riguardante il Corpo della Polizia Civile, già da tempo all’attenzione del Congresso di Stato. Preme precisare che, recentemente, attraverso l’elaborazione dell’articolo 31 della Legge 113/2020, si è intervenuti proprio per modificare le modalità dei copertura dei posti dirigenziali definitivamente vacanti. È stato infatti creato un automatismo in grado di garantire continuità anche in caso di assenza definitiva di un dirigente senza che vi sia la necessità di ricorrere ad una delibera del Congresso di Stato, come avvenuto finora. Ci si è liberati quindi di un passaggio basato sulla discrezionalità a vantaggio di un meccanismo equilibrato, basato appunto sull’ordine gerarchico. Una novità che è stata altresì oggetto di una nota inviata da questa Segreteria di Stato a tutti gli appartenenti al Corpo della Polizia Civile il 30 giugno u.s. In linea con la superiore modifica legislativa, i competenti uffici della Pubblica Amministrazione hanno provveduto a richiedere all’Ufficiale ed agli Ispettori del Corpo, nel rispetto dell’ordine gerarchico, la disponibilità a ricoprire temporaneamente la posizione di Comandante per un periodo di tre mesi eventualmente prorogabili per altri tre, secondo quanto stabilito dalla nuova normativa di riferimento. A seguito della formalizzazione della rinuncia all’incarico da parte dell’Ufficiale del Corpo, si è, quindi, proceduto con il primo Ispettore che, sulla base della gerarchia interna, aveva manifestato la propria disponibilità ovverosia l’Ispettore Athos Gattei. Dal 24 luglio u.s. l’Ispettore Gattei è, perciò, stato temporaneamente incaricato, mediante provvedimento del competente ufficio di gestione del personale, quale Comandante della Polizia Civile. Non vi è stata, pertanto, alcuna “forzatura” nel conferimento dell’incarico come impropriamente asserito nel comunicato dell’USL bensì, al contrario, la procedura seguita è assolutamente lineare e trasparente come si evince dagli atti del procedimento che ricordiamo sono liberamente accessibili da chiunque. Ci teniamo infine a rassicurare che la situazione del Corpo della Polizia Civile è oggetto, da diverse settimane, di incontri e ricognizioni: da un lato per inquadrare le criticità più urgenti e lavorare a risposte a breve-medio termine; dall’altro, per giungere alla definizione di una riorganizzazione in grado di dare una risposta efficace ai problemi stratificatisi nel tempo ma che naturalmente necessita di tempi più lunghi.

The study also suggests a new access to the Kansas Turnpike could be added between Broadway and Hydraulic, and includes a fully directional interchange at K-15.
 This elevated parkway/bridge over K15, the railroad track, and the river would do more than just eliminate frustrating delays. It also would address future congestion issues, provide relief to the existing transportation network, improve access for emergency response, and provide an economic boost. The trafficway, particularly when coupled with a new turnpike interchange, would support industrial parks in the Clearwater, Mulvane, Haysville, Derby and Rose Hill communities and open the entire 95th Street corridor to development.
 Even when properly planned for, transportation projects are expensive. The estimated cost for the first phase of improvements including the new river and railroad crossing and the interchange at K-15 is $62 million.
 While this cost is small when compared to many regional transportation projects, making a 95th Street bridge happen requires city, county, state and federal funding. Residents and business owners in the area of Mulvane, Clearwater, Haysville, Derby and Rose Hill need to tell their county and state representatives the project is needed. ARC95 is vital to the residents and economy of Sedgwick County, and finding funding for it should be a priority.

When you think about cyber espionage, the Vatican doesn't come to mind as an obvious target. It's a tiny country whose leader has more moral authority than worldly power.
 But China and the Vatican are expected to begin sensitive negotiations in September to a renew a secret deal over control of the Catholic Church in China. Chinese leaders may have been looking for an advantage -- inside knowledge on how the Holy See planned to approach the bargaining table, according to a report released Tuesday by Recorded Future, a threat intelligence firm.
 The names of the suspected groups, such as Mustang Panda and RedDelta, bring to mind the cloak-and-dagger world of the medieval Catholic Church, when the Pope dispatched powerful envoys to royal courts around the world. But the report is less Dan Brown than careful data analysis. It accuses China of using malicious software to slip into the Vatican's internal networks.

The State Level Monitoring Committee (SLMC) on Solid Waste Management constituted by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has pulled up the State Pollution Control Board (PCB) for the delay in imposing environmental compensation on those responsible for the uncleared demolition debris of Alfa Serene apartments at Maradu remaining under the waters of the Vembanad Lake.
 The committee also reminded the Maradu Municipality of its wrong notion that it was not bound by law. “The PCB cannot absolve from its responsibility of recovering compensation for environmental degradation from the defaulters on the lame excuse that rules do not provide for methods for quantification of compensation. The recalcitrant attitude of the municipality was evident at every stage of the removal of the demolition waste,” said an additional report filed by A.V. Ramakrishna Pillai, SLMC Chairman, before the NGT’s Southern Bench on July 27.
 Mr. Pillai, who visited the site on July 26, detected the presence of reinforced beams at a distance of nearly 15 metres from the bank towards the middle of the waterbody. “At some points, steel bars used for reinforced concrete are seen protruding above the water level. Neither the Maradu Municipality nor the Joint Committee [constituted by the committee as per the directions of the NGT] can sit idle till the last piece of debris is removed from the waterbody. If the existing debris in the waterbody remains there, it will lead to undesirable results in future,” said the report.
 On the PCB’s delay in imposing environmental compensation on the defaulters, the committee said there could not be any straightjacket formula for assessing the quantum of compensation. “However, while assessing compensation, the authority has to be guided by established norms and principles, which would appear to be just and reasonable. The quantum of compensation fixed shall be neither too low nor disproportionately high. The authority fixing the compensation has to strike a proper balance between these two,” it said.
 The SLMC informed the NGT that it would send a wrong message to the defaulters, if recovery of environmental compensation was delayed indefinitely. The Southern Bench of the tribunal had pointed out in May that the Maradu Municipality could not shirk its responsibility in ensuring the disposal of debris resulted out of the demolition of the four apartment buildings as per the Municipal Solid Waste Rules, 2016.
