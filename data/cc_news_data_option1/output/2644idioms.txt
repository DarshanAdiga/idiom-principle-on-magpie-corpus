New Delhi The central government told the Supreme Court on Monday that it has reservations about issuing court summons and serving notices to litigants over WhatsApp.Attorney general (AG) KK Venugopal, representing the central government, told the top court that service of notices and summons should be permitted through email and fax in view of Covid -19 ,but not through WhatsApp given that the messaging app does not allow the government to access data even in matters concerning terrorism and pornography."Union government has reservations regarding WhatsApp. It does not allow (government to) access (data) in cases involving terrorism and pornography", Venugopal told a bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde.The submissions were made in a case relating to extension of the limitation period for filing cases. Limitation period is the deadline to file cases in any court or tribunal in the country. The limitation period is generally prescribed under the Limitation Act. It is also sometimes provided under special laws in certain cases.The Supreme Court had, on March 23, extended for an indefinite period, the limitation period to file cases in any court on tribunal amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The order was passed by the apex court in a suo motu (on its own) case initiated after taking into account the coronavirus threat and the resultant difficulties faced by litigants in approaching courts.The issue of service of summons and notice through WhatsApp came up on Monday during submissions by the central government requesting the apex court to pass further orders allowing summons and notice through email and fax.The matter was eventually adjourned for July 10.Certain high courts like the Bombay high court and Madras high court had allowed service of notice to parties via WhatsApp.The Delhi high court, after taking note of the spurt in coronavirus disease cases, issued a circular on June 9 allowing service of documents, notices and summons through WhatsApp, email and fax.The Bombay high court had, in 2018, held that the service of notices through WhatsApp was valid.AG Venugopal, however, said that the practice should not be allowed for the time being and pointed to a case which is pending before the Supreme Court on the traceability of messages sent over WhatsApp.He was referring to a case from Tamil Nadu involving WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube in which the government has pressed for a decryption of messages on social media and messaging platforms in matters involving considerations of national security, law and order etc.That case had started before the Madras high court as a plea for linkage of social media accounts with Aadhaar. Subsequently, the Tamil Nadu government raised concerns about WhatsApp not cooperating with police probes in key cases, citing end-to-end encryption.The matter was transferred to the Supreme Court in October 2019 on a plea by Facebook in August 2019.WhatsApp has maintained that the original sender of a message cannot be tracked because of end-to-end encryption."For Facebook and WhatsApp to say they cannot decrypt is not acceptable. A terrorist cannot claim privacy", AG Venugopal told the court in October 2019.

_“When I hear people talking about being allies of the LGBTQ+ community, mainly in the Black and Trans community, it’s almost laughable. We watch them profit from our pain, making these surface level posts of solidarity – especially in music. When I think about Black Lives Matter and Trans Lives Matter, you don’t get to see any representations of collaborations – many would never share a post, let alone do a song together. So when I heard Dan Reynolds wanted me on his song, I nearly flipped. I wasn’t surprised, though – he’s been so intentional in sharing posts, helping to raise money within our community and more. He really puts the A in ally!!! This is a proud moment in music history, and I feel honored to be a part of such an important song during this climate… we need to know where everyone stands in the music community, as music is an essential tool that can change the hearts and minds of so many.”_

New Delhi The number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases recorded in the national capital till now crossed the 100,000 mark on Monday, crossing a grim milestone that underlines the challenge in containing the outbreak even as daily numbers show a sustained decline.The capital recorded 1,379 new cases, the lowest in a day since June 9, according to Delhi government data. The number of tests dipped from 23,136 in Sunday's to 13,879 in Monday's bulletin. The capital's first case was 127 days ago when on March 2, a 45-year-old man from Mayur Vihar tested positive after returning from Italy.Senior government officials said the dip in the number of tests conducted on July 5 was because it was a Sunday. Government data confirmed the trend. On June 28 (Sunday), 16,157 tests were conducted and on June 21 (Sunday), 14,682 tests were conducted. "On Saturday, all the 11 districts had conducted a total of 23,136 tests, which dropped to 13,879 on Sunday. These numbers include both RT-PCR and rapid antigen detection tests. Earlier also, the testing numbers had dipped on Sundays because fewer people turn up and fewer workers report to duty. They cannot be working seven days a week for months together," a senior government official said. The city touched the 1-lakh mark six days later than predicted by a five-member panel set up in the beginning of June to aid the Delhi government plan the increase of infrastructure. Contrary to what the committee had suggested, the number of active cases has also not shot up to 50,000-60,000 yet.It has remained between 25,000-27,000 for the last two weeks--reaching a peak of 28,329 active cases on June 27."We had predicted the trajectory of the infection based on the trends then. Anyway, it was the worst-case scenario; now we are well-prepared to handle the cases. The number of active cases seems to have stabilised. This is mainly due to two reasons--now even though we are testing over 20,000 people a day, the positivity rate has been reducing--fewer new cases are being reported. At the same time, the number of recoveries has gone up," said Dr Arun Gupta, one of the members of the panel and the president of Delhi Medical Council.Reduced mortalityEven though it is declining, Delhi's case fatality rate--the number of people who died of Covid-19--remains over 3%. This is slightly higher than the national average of about 2.8%.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal during a press briefing on Monday said the number of deaths due to Covid-19 has come down. "Earlier, over 125 deaths were being reported on a single day. Now there are 55 to 60 deaths daily. So, the umber of deaths has come down by half. It needs to be reduced further," he said.Dr Gupta said, "No one across the globe has been able to predict the behaviour of this infection; the models have all failed. But, from the current numbers, I feel that the number of new cases and new hospitalisations will start going down now."Recovery rate upAn increased recovery rate is the reason for the number of active cases stabilising. The number of recoveries shot up June 18 onwards when 3,884 people recovered or were discharged in one day, rather than the few hundred that were recovering before. According to the data provided by the Delhi government, the highest number of recoveries was recorded on June 20-- 7,725.An increase in the number of cases in June and the revised discharge policy of the union health ministry--wherein a Covid-19 patient can be discharged 10 days after the onset of symptoms or three days after recovery-- are likely the reasons for Delhi's increased recovery rate.On Monday, the recovery rate stood at 71.4%; it had crossed the 70%-mark a day ago."I do not know whether the increased recovery rate is because of a change in the behaviour of the virus. It could also be that we are testing more people in the community and detecting mild cases. However, I have always believed, that Sar-Cov-2 just like any other zoonotic virus will slowly adapt and become less virulent. However, the virus is unlikely to disappear, it will cause milder symptoms and people will get used to living with it. A vaccine will also help," said Dr Shobha Broor, former head of the department of microbiology at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).The data also shows that hospitalisations have started going down - with 5,250 people in hospitals on Monday as opposed to over 6,000 people that were in hospitals the week ending on June 28. This decline, however, is because of the decline in the number of new cases being recorded and not because the cases are milder.The proportion of active cases that need hospitalisation has remained more or less the same at about 21%."It is too soon to judge whether the infection has peaked. The positivity rate has gone down since the rapid antigen tests began. They have been testing even the asymptomatic people in the community, which is likely the reason for brining down positivity rate. If you take a population that is likely to have the infection and test them, the positivity rate will be higher. Having said that, Covid-19 is likely to plateau in Delhi soon," said Dr Broor.Low positivity rateDelhi's positivity rate - proportion of people who test positive among those tested - has also continued to decline and came to a single digit for the first time on Sunday after May third week. On Sunday, only 2,244 of the 23,136 people tested turned out to be positive, bringing the positivity rate to 9.7%.Experts say this is a positive sign as the number continues to decline despite increased testing.The highest positivity rate of almost 37% was recorded on June 13 - when the number of tests being conducted in the city in a day had gone down. On average, 5,525 people were being tested in a single day then. Now, the figure stands at over 20,000.The deployment of the rapid antigen testing helped the government in considerably scaling up testing, with the government now asking all hospitals to test people in the high-risk groups, such as older people and the immune-compromised to be tested mandatorily.

GurugramPrivate employers in Gurugram expressed their dismay at the Haryana government's plan of reserving 75 percent jobs in private sector for youth domiciled in the state (excluding jobs paying more than Rs 50,000 per month) and said that the move might gravely hamper the region's economic recovery in a post-Covid worldThe move can also fundamentally change the economic landscape of the city, which employs people from across Haryana, Delhi-NCR, India and even the world, stakeholders said. The proposed ordinance -- Haryana State Employment of Local Candidates Ordinance, 2020 -- was cleared for drafting on Monday by the Haryana cabinet, and will be tabled before the council of minister during its next meeting. The Jannayak Janta Party (JJP), coalition partner of the BJP in the state, had made a commitment to provide 75 percent quota in private sector jobs to Haryana youths in its election manifesto last year.Manas Fuloria, founder of a city-based IT-firm and spokesperson for NASSCOM, Haryana, said, "At present, there is not much clarity on the specific terms of the ordinance. We are ourselves trying to ascertain whether it applies only to unskilled labour, or skilled jobs as well. If the ordinance is passed as a blanket reservation, many private companies may choose to relocate their employees to other cities, at least on paper. It will be possible for a lot of companies to work remotely in the current scenario. But I think industries like manufacturing and real estate will be hit hard by these constraints."A senior employee of a prominent real estate firm in Gurugram, seeking anonymity, said, "We have been relying on skilled workmen from states like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh for years. To train locals from scratch is an investment that we cannot make as we are in a period of economic downturn. This ordinance will make Haryana a less attractive location for private firms to do business. Once the draft ordinance is made public, we can put up our objections to it." Employers in the manufacturing sector also appeared worried at the prospect of such an ordinance being promulgated into a law. Pankaj Yadav, president of the Gurugram Udyog Association, said, "At this point in time, jobs are already scarce. Industries should be allowed to hire at their discretion for the next few years at least. This is not the time to be putting such constraints on us in an already reeling economy. We have no issues with hiring locals, but finding people with the right skills and qualifications will become much harder, and possibly more expensive as well."
