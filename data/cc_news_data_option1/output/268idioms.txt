Rodomonte decides to stay at an inn there for the night, and when dining with the landlord drinks alcohol, against his faith. He becomes out of sorts as a result, and starts asking others there about their wives and their fidelity. The landlord casts doubt on the faithfulness of wives, telling a story of a Venetian gentleman who he once met, who was well versed in the deceits of women. He offers to tell Rodomonte one of the most remarkable stories of all - which is sufficiently worrying that Ariosto warns his female readers to skip the whole of the next Canto, in which he relates the Venetian's tale.

"The novelty of our approach lies in the use of specific magnetic particles as a filler of a piezopolymer matrix. Along with magnetic properties they also possess the magnetocaloric effect, i.e. change their temperature under the influence of a magnetic field. Magnetocaloric materials are a promising basis for the development of alternative cooling systems, the so-called 'magnetic freezers'. It's also recently been suggested that they could be used in biomedical applications," said Karim Amirov, a Candidate of Physics and Mathematics, a senior researcher at the Laboratory for New Magnetic Materials, Kant Baltic Federal University. According to him, to create magnetoelectric smart composites, magnetocaloric substances are added to PVDF (dissolved in the dimethylformamide solvent) and evenly spread. After that the polymer is dried down in line with a specific temperature and time protocol. The result is a flexible piezopolymer plate of a given shape with incorporated magnetic particles. Such a plate can be easily cut with scissors.

Villains in the Marvel Cinematic Universe don't usually stay around, but Loki just wouldn't go away. Even when he was "killed" in the second Thor film, it turned out that he was still alive and even dethroned Odin. His most villainous moments were during the first Thor film and The Avengers, which served as the main opponents of both films. Loki accidentally brought The Avengers together and acted as a crafty creator who faithfully serves his title. Loki is the god of mischief, who makes him the perfect villain to act behind the scenes and cause chaos. Although he ultimately found salvation, his charismatic role as villain is simply not to be forgotten. He will be remembered forever as the MCU's first major evil.

Hello nightmare fuel and thank you for ruining my night. Has anyone ever wondered why people today worry so much about the content of movies when the stuff from decades ago looks like a drug-induced nightmare no one remembers? Seriously, most of the characters in this version of Alice in Wonderland look like they came straight from The Shining and felt very comfortable returning to the overlook at the end of the day. One thing that is pretty obvious, if you look closely, is that they followed the original story very closely, as Disney's animated version did, although when everything is said and done, a lot of people seem happy, great Parts of the book and leave out I immediately get the idea that Alice gets lost in Wonderland until she finds the Red Queen, whereupon things only become more confusing and dangerous. Personally, I've always enjoyed the tea party scene, and there's nothing that could affect the joy of Cheshire that wasn't originally a big part of the story, but only in the animated version and then in the Tim Burton version to. Something about this cat has always been the most appealing part of the story, while the rest was a bumpy and lumpy ride through a crazy kingdom that has a lot of inner problems and a ruler who is a bit beheaded.

But how did the roads end up leading to Georgia after an initial commitment to the Sooners?


  "When we went through the first time, we just we wanted a fit for quarterback play. That was the number one goal. Where is the best fit that's going to develop Brock and give him a chance to go to the next level?" Vandagriff said. "With what Oklahoma and Lincoln Riley have done, that's easy to answer, you know? But he came to us at Christmas or during the break after talking with friends, family, grandparents and my sister, who lives in Knoxville, those little conversations they have on the side were just, 'I probably will only get to see you play one time.' Hearing those conversations made him think, 'Dang, I don't have to do this now. I don't have to go to Oklahoma.'"


  That's when home became the clear option.


  "When he came back and said, 'Look, I want to reconsider' and the first decision was about football and what's best for, like who's going to develop in them. The next decision's about family, really, and this decision is about really where does Brock want to go play? Because he believes wherever he goes, he can make them a winner regardless. He can win in any system. Now my job as a father is to support him and the school he chooses, so now it's Georgia."


  And for Dad, that sits more than fine, especially given the longterm benefits.


  "Am I thrilled for the fact he's 10 minutes down the road and I can see him any time I want to, good, bad, indifferent? I'm tickled to death. You know, and it's a thing where I hope he has a great career. Nonetheless, I hope he just goes there and gets a degree and has a chance in life to be successful," Vandagriff said. "It's those other things where the rest of his life now he says, 'Well, I was a quarterback at Georgia,' and that means something in this state. Or if he went to Oklahoma and said, 'I was a quarterback at Oklahoma,' and you're living in Georgia, nobody cares. It sets you up for life."

Blood consists of a liquid medium called plasma and blood cells suspended in it and performing different functions. Thrombocytes protect our bodies from blood loss in case of an injury. They look like colourless oblate spheroids 2-4 micron in diameter and are produced by red bone marrow. As a rule, thrombocytes remain deactivated; however, when vascular walls are damaged, and cell disintegration products and special molecular "distress signals" are released in the blood, they react with the proteins on the surface of thrombocytes and activate them. When a thrombocyte is activated, it quickly and almost always irreversibly changes its state and shape, increasing its surface area. As a result thrombocytes acquire the ability to stick to each other (this process is called aggregation) and to vascular walls (adhesion). A clot is formed, and serious blood loss is prevented. Moreover, thrombocytes release the so-called growth factor into body tissues surrounding the injury site, making them divide faster.

One of my favorite holiday movies is "Home Alone." In the 1990 comedy, the McCallister family is planning a trip to Paris for the holidays, but oversleeps on the morning of their departure, which causes havoc. In their rush leave, the family accidentally forgets their youngest child, 8-year-old Kevin, and leave him home alone.      Chances are, you've seen the movie and you probably know the antics that ensue as Kevin protects the family's Chicago home from burglars.      But a scene I've always loved is the one of the large family rushing through the airport and barely making it on the plane. They get settled and after the plane takes off, the mother gasps "KEVIN!"      Now, I've never forgotten a child at home while on vacation, thank God. Vacations are stressful enough.      And while I've always loved the scene of the family rushing through the airport, trying to get to the gate on time, it's recently occurred to me how simpler things must have been for airline passengers in a pre-9/11 world.      The McAllister family obviously wasn't delayed by security. They didn't have to take off their shoes and their jackets. They didn't have to go through a full body scan machine. You don't see Kevin's family dragging carry-on size suitcases through the terminal in their rush for the gate. Today, the cost of checked luggage is so high, but back then then it was free.      And chances are, the parents didn't have to worry about what food options there were in that terminal because in 1990 most flights still provided food other than pretzels. (Although, I suppose, a transcontinental flight to Europe still provides meals.)      Last month, my family of five flew to California for New Year's. It was part family vacation - we took the kids to Disneyland and the San Diego Zoo. But it was a serious trip too, as we finally had a memorial service for our dad and spread some of his ashes at sea. We also finished emptying out the family home of the last 50 years.      We spent every second of that trip trying to make memories and enjoy the time with the kids, which meant the last day was rushed. Thirty minutes after our original "leave" time for the airport, I was still trying to cram everything into our carry-on size suitcases.      There were five of us, including our 10, 8 and 4-year-old kids. And there were six suitcases, five which were carry-on size (I'm not paying a fortune to check suitcases), three backpacks, a purse, my grandmother's ashes in an urn and a Star Wars robot from Disneyland. We looked like a herd of bogged-down camels, rushing to get to the airport.      Despite leaving later than planned, we returned the rental car and got to the terminal in decent time. We exited the rental car shuttle, entered an elevator that took us to the ticketing section of Terminal 4 at LAX airport, and then headed for the American Airlines desk. When we got to the self-help kiosk to get our boarding passes, I stopped to count my children. There were two - but we have three children.      "Where's Eliza?" I asked my two oldest kids, referring to their 4-year-old little sister. They shrugged. I asked my husband, in panic, "Where's Eliza?" He looked at our kids, then looked down the terminal where we had just dragged all of our belongings.      I shouted. "ELIZA?!?" which reverberated against the terminal's two-story ceilings. People turned around to look. I shouted again. My husband then dropped the bags and ran.      I told our older kids not to move and to stay with the bags, and then also ran down the ticketing hall, shouting Eliza's name.      She wasn't even in the building.      She was only gone a couple of minutes at most. A kind stranger saw my panicked husband and pointed him outside, where our scared pre-schooler stood on the sidewalk outside the airport next to the traffic. An airline attendant noticed our daughter all alone and was holding her hand. For that, I am so grateful.      Apparently, when we boarded the elevator as we first entered the airport, there were two doors, one that led inside the airport, and the other, which led back outside. As we exited the elevator toward the ticketing hall inside LAX, our daughter thought we were going back outside, and had walked through the wrong door.      Unlike "Home Alone" it was no comedy situation. It will probably be one of those moments I'll tell my grandkids about one day, the time we lost a kid in LAX. Hopefully by then we'll be able to laugh about it. For now, I'm still trying to calm my nerves.   Lydia Seabol Avant writes The Mom Stop for The Tuscaloosa News in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin warned Tuesday.
 Mnuchin issued the warning after France agreed to delay the imposition of its own digital tax in the face of threats of steep U.S. tariffs on French exports. Mnuchin said French President Emmanuel Macron agreed to hold off on the tax through the end of the year while the two countries work out a permanent resolution.
 The truce is “the beginning of a solution,” Mnuchin said an interview with The Wall Street Journal at a Journal-sponsored event on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos.
 France announced the tax last year as a way of collecting revenue from web- based companies that pay little or no tax on substantial sales in France. Italy’s parliament passed a similar tax last year that was set to take effect this year. Britain is scheduled to implement a similar tax this year.
 Mnuchin said the U.S. was clear it thought France’s digital tax was an unfair levy on gross revenue and hoped Britain and Italy would suspend their plans. “If not they’ll find themselves faced with President Trump’s tariffs. We’ll be having similar conversations with them.”
 Countries working through the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development recently arrived at a plan for apportioning taxes paid by multinational companies on activity that spans borders and isn’t easily captured by existing income tax schemes, including digital activity. The U.S. has signaled it objects to the plan but supports a mechanism to resolve global tax disputes that would give multinational companies a safe harbor.
 With a “phase one” trade deal with China in place, Mnuchin also said phase two wouldn’t necessarily be a “big bang” that removes all existing tariffs. “We may do 2A and some of the tariffs come off. We can do this sequentially along the way.”
 In addition, Mnuchin said the U.S. would run deficits of about $1 trillion for the next two years, because of some provisions of the tax cut such as expensing of investment, and increased government spending agreed to as part of an agreement with congressional Democrats. But “I’ll stick with my projections that the tax deal will pay for itself,” he said.

When he debuted in The Force Awakens, it was shown that this villain had been in conflict internally and wanted to be more like Darth Vader than Luke. When it turned out to be Ben Solo, the son of Han and Leia, it triggered a great arc of character. Han confronted him trying to redeem him, but Kylo ran his lightsaber through him. Darth Vader was angry, but the way to his villain began with his mother's death. Kylo Ren murdered his own father in cold blood. It's pretty hard to redeem someone afterwards, but they've managed to find their way back to the light in Rise of Skywalker. Still, we can never forgive him for freeing Star Wars from Han Solo.

To that end, there are more weapons in DOOM Eternal. There are more mods. There are more upgrades to your Praetor Suit. There are more divergent paths you can choose to power yourself up.
 Enemies seem to have had their mobility upped, and the ballet of death that DOOM 2016 mastered so well has been tuned to be more intense.
 Resource management is a problem you need to solve on the fly – ammo is scarce, relentless waves of demons are a constant drain on your health and armour, and staying still means certain death.
 Even on the easier difficulties, you need to think about your whole toolbox in order to come out on top. Wandering around with just a shotgun and your fists isn't going to get you very far at all.
 "‘The game doesn’t just give anything to you, you have to earn it," says Stratton.
 Chainsaw kills will cause enemies to spray ammo out of their severed arteries, using your (gnarly) shoulder-mounted flamethrower will force defeated foes to spit up armour, and tapping your melee button to activate those beautifully OTT Glory Kills will repay you with health.
 It's a satisfying, rhythmic dance that you don't really see on any other battlefield in gaming, and it's something that Stratton is understandably proud of.
 "[We like to call it] Aggressive resource management," says Stratton. "Burn, execute, kill. If you need something, it’s there. You just have to think about it, then go out there and take it. It’s push forward combat."

Sur ce dernier point, la secrétaire d'État a annoncé que l'agence 'equal.brussels' était en train de travailler sur des mesures pour lutter contre le phénomène des proxénètes de jeunes filles.

GOAL - by Sam France
 Javier Hernandez says the time is right for him to make the move to MLS, after completing his transfer from La Liga side Sevilla to LA Galaxy.
 Hernandez, now 31, has left Europe for the first time since joining Manchester United from Chivas in 2010.
 In between, he has represented Real Madrid, Bayer Leverkusen and West Ham – but, at the Hammers and in Seville, he struggled for first-team minutes.
 A marquee signing in MLS, Mexico’s all-time top goalscorer doesn’t see it as a ‘retirement league’. Speaking with the Los Angeles Times, Hernandez described his arrival with an apt simile.
 “Like when people describe me playing,” Hernandez said. “You know, that he’s always in the right place at the right time.
 “The last two years, the managers decided on giving confidence to other players rather than me.
 “And now, the LA Galaxy, the manager of the club and the league, are telling me, ‘Look, Javier, we want to give you all the trust, all the confidence to help us,’ and that’s why I’m taking this opportunity.
 “I’m going to be able to play in front of a lot of Mexican fans, Galaxy fans, American fans,” he said. “That’s what’s great about football. They give you a lot of opportunities.”
 Hernandez will link up with Mexico team-mate Jonathan dos Santos at the Galaxy, and will face off against Carlos Vela of LAFC in the growing Los Angeles rivalry.
 With his own international appearances becoming more few and far between in recent years, the 109-cap forward might be expected to have the 2022 World Cup at the back of his mind.
 “Like when people describe me playing. You know, that he’s always in the right place at the right time,” Hernandez said in his first interview as a Galaxy player, with the LA Times.
 However, Hernandez says this isn’t the case.
 “Right now, my mind is completely on the LA Galaxy,” he said.
 “I’m going to be playing. That’s what I want in my life.
 “People are going to say it was because I couldn’t make it [in Europe], but sometimes in football there are things that are not in your hands.
 “Jonathan told me the league is very underrated. I really believe you don’t go there to retire.”
 With the next instalment of the LA derby pencilled in for mid-May, fans will have to wait to see Hernandez and Vela go head-to-head in 'El Trafico'.

Google Assistant is also said to be far more deeply embedded in the OS (Android 10 out of the box for this one), meaning more intuitive and speedy responses when interacting with the device.
 One of the newest features for the Pixel 4 series is that it claims to have the fastest face unlock system on any smartphone; fingers point to the company’s new motion-sensing Soli chip next to the front-facing camera sensor. For the Pixel 4 series, Google’s omitted the strategically-placed fingerprint sensor, replacing the security features with facial recognition unlock and basic PIN entry.
 The camera, one of Pixel’s highest selling points, has undergone a further boost with astrophotography facilities, learning-based white balancing features and a wider range Portrait mode. Then there’s the new Live HDR+ which will let users preview HDR+ processing in the camera app before taking the photo, and the Dual Exposure controls which gives users the power to adjust shadows and highlights in a shot before taking the photo.
 That said, it doesn’t seem like the lack of availability of the Pixel 4 will keep Google loyalists or new demographics from finding ways to buy the phone.

In a recently published study, the economists investigated why so much research work in the behavioral sciences is not reproducible - or only to a limited extent. They argue that established checklists that are intended to make important aspects of the studies transparent are inadequate. According to the economist and co-author, Professor Marko Sarstedt, in physics no study would pass muster without stating the accuracy of the measurements used. "Although providing corresponding calibration data for the measurement of social phenomena is difficult to conceive of, it is not impossible." In the study the economists advocate transferring concepts from the natural sciences to the behavioral sciences and show, using a sample calculation, what major consequences the allowance for measurement uncertainty can have for a seemingly statistically significant result.

Well, number one, I think [that sentiment] is untrue, which we should all say loudly. I mean, I did get more votes both in the primary, by about 4 million, and in the general election, by about 3 million. I think that both the press and the public have to really hold everybody running accountable for what they say and what their campaign says and does. That's particularly true with what's going on right now with the Bernie campaign having gone after Elizabeth with a very personal attack on her. Then this argument about whether or not or when he did or didn't say that a woman couldn't be elected, it's part of a pattern. If it were a one-off, you might say, "OK, fine." But he said I was unqualified. I had a lot more experience than he did, and got a lot more done than he had, but that was his attack on me. I just think people need to pay attention because we want, hopefully, to elect a president who's going to try to bring us together, and not either turn a blind eye, or actually reward the kind of insulting, attacking, demeaning, degrading behavior that we've seen from this current administration.

"We compared the fecal microbes of 22 moderate/severe TBI patients residing in a long-term care facility with 18 healthy age-matched control subjects, identifying disruptions of intestinal metabolism and changes in nutrient utilization in TBI patients that could explain the reduced growth hormone function."

OTTAWA - Canada and its allies are pushing Iran to move the black boxes from the Ukrainian jetliner it shot down to a facility that can quickly download its crucial flight data.
 Foreign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne says the request emerged from his conference call on Monday with counterparts from Britain, Sweden, Afghanistan and Ukraine, all of which lost citizens in the crash of Ukraine International Airlines flight PS752.
 It was the first follow-up conversation of the so-called International Co- ordination and Response Group for victims of PS752 since Champagne hosted its inaugural meeting in London last week.
 Canada pushed to form the group to add weight and unity to the international effort to ensure Iran's co-operation after its Revolutionary Guard shot down the passenger plane earlier this month, killing all 176 aboard.
 A summary of Champagne's call with representatives from the response group says Iran is co-operating with foreign experts in the investigation, but also emphasizes the need for Iran to allow a thorough and credible international investigation.
 "Members of the ICRG call on Iran to move the black boxes to a facility with all of the technology and expertise required to quickly and reliably download and analyze the data without delay," the summary says.
 "Iran has indicated it is willing to do so."
 On Sunday, Champagne wrote to his Iranian counterpart, Mohammad Javad Zarif — two days after they met face to face in Oman — to stress Canada's view that the black boxes should be sent quickly for analysis by experts in either France or Ukraine.

KFC on Tuesday apologized for an advertisement in Australia that shows two boys ogling a woman's breasts, after calls from a local campaign group to boycott the fast-food giant over the ad it called "sexist."
 The 15-second ad, which has been running on television for the past three weeks and is also posted on KFC Australia's YouTube channel, shows a woman dressed in a short playsuit check her bottom and adjust her breasts as she looks at her reflection in the window of a parked car.
 The car's window then rolls down to show two young boys staring at the woman's breasts, before she smiles and says, "Did someone say KFC?"
 The Zinger Popcorn box ad has so far garnered over 60,000 views with over 160 dislikes and 700 likes on YouTube.
 "We apologize if anyone was offended by our latest commercial. Our intention was not to stereotype women and young boys in a negative light," a spokesperson for Yum Brands-owned KFC's South Pacific unit said.
 While many viewers did not approve of the ad, some took to Twitter to label the ad "funny" and said there was no need for the company to apologize.
 Collective Shout, a group which campaigns against the objectification of women, condemned the ad and said it was a "regression to tired and archaic stereotypes where young women are sexually objectified for male pleasure."
 "Ads like this reinforce the false idea that we can't expect better from boys. It is another manifestation of the 'boys will be boys' trope, hampering our ability to challenge sexist ideas which contribute to harmful behaviour towards women and girls," the group's spokeswoman, Melinda Liszewski, said.
 Last month, exercise bike maker Peloton Interactive Inc faced heavy criticism for its Christmas advertisement, in which a woman receiving the company's bike as a gift from her husband was called "sexist" and "dystopian" on social media.
 Some said the husband was "controlling" and "manipulative" as buying his wife an exercise bike suggested that she needed to lose weight.
 Both ads were criticized nearly a month after they were first published on online media and television.

The Constitution, ratified in 1788, prescribes impeachment in cases of "Treason, Bribery and other high Crimes and Misdemeanors" by the president -- but unfortunately, Thomas Jefferson, Ben Franklin and the gang didn't exactly spell out what they meant by a "high crime." Today, Trump's legal team says that he's in the clear, because pressuring Ukraine to dig dirt on his rivals isn't technically a crime -- an argument that Democrats see as absurdly literal, since it would allow a President to abuse power with impunity.

PARIS -- Chanel on Tuesday transported guests from the bling of fashion week to a herb-filled cloister garden where models showed off demure looks in black, white and grey in a nod to founder Coco Chanel's early years in a nunnery.
 The designer, who started her clothing label in 1910, spent several years at the Aubazine abbey in the south-west of France as a teenager after her mother died. She learned to sew at Aubazine, which was run by nuns as an orphanage.
 The nuns' black and white habits - two recurring colors in Chanel's repertoire and present in the looks on the runway at Paris' Grand Palais exhibition hall on Tuesday - are said to have inspired the young designer.
 The French label is one of the big names presenting one-of-a-kind creations as part of Haute Couture Week in Paris.
 Chanel's current creative chief Virginie Viard, who succeeded Karl Lagerfeld after his death last year, paraded a series of buttoned-up looks in sync with the decor as models wound their way around a fountain in the aromatic garden.
 Some styles in the Spring-Summer 2020 collection echoed schoolgirl uniforms, including patent leather black shoes worn with little white ankle socks.
 Model Gigi Hadid showed off an especially austere black outfit with a white collar.
 G-Dragon, leader of the South-Korean Big Bang boy band, French actress Eva Green and U.S. singer Pharrell Williams were among celebrity guests attending the show.
 Gerard and Alain Wertheimer, the elusive co-owners of Chanel, also attended. (Reporting by Noemie Olive and Charles Platiau; Writing by Matthieu Protard; Editing by Sarah White and Alexandra Hudson)

 IRIS VAN HERPEN EXCELS
 Another season of Dutch wunderkind Iris Van Herpen, another moment to delve into her unique world of visual poetry.
 Floating jelly fish and skeletal underwater crustaceans are often evoked visually in the designer's award-winning couture, but rarely referenced by the house as inspiration.
 This season, it acknowledged that spring-summer's designs channeled “the sensory processes that occur between the intricate composition of the human body, mirrored with the fibrous marine ecology of our oceans.”
 It made for one of the designer's most beautiful collections ever.
 Twisted silk strands on a gown descended down a model's body in pastel blues, grays and coconut white, like the tentacles of a deep-sea creature, with the floating feeling of suspended gravity.
 A black floor-length gown with undulating straps could have been a poisonous medusa, with coral-red dye bleeding down its multi-layered skirt.
 Toward the end, one of the most beautiful pieces of couture in memory appeared — a brilliant white structured three-dimensional gown made of thousands of interlocking petals of white fabric that evoked a swan, or perhaps a section of human bone under the microscope.

 GIAMBATTISTA VALLI'S EXHIBIT
 The fashion seasons run at a relenting pace. And France's longest transport strike in decades complicated an already frenetic calendar last week.
 This was perhaps in the mind of Giambattista Valli, who this season decided to take his foot off the pedal and put on an exhibit, instead of a high-octane — blink and you miss it — runway show.
 The — mostly — fun designs proved it to be a good decision.
 On mannequins inside Paris' Jeu de Paume, the Italian-born designer showed off his couture skills of abstraction with pieces that possessed flourishes at the shoulder or skirt.
 Crimson tulle ruffles appeared like vertical columns on both sides of a sleeveless silk gown. A voluminous white feather headpiece looked like a wild, windswept shrub. While a bitter lemon-colored dress with huge gathered full skirt was lit up on a yellow mannequin — to make the whole world seem yellow.

India will play five T20 Internationals (T20Is), three ODIs and two Tests during the tour starting with the shortest format on January 24.


  From 2002, when India played ODIs and Tests on green tops, to 2009, when India won only their second Test series in 32 years, Tendulkar has seen it all in New Zealand.


  "I remember when we played in 2009, the Hamilton pitch was different compared to other pitches. Other pitches got harder (Wellington and Napier) but not Hamilton. It remained soft.


  "But Napier became hard with passage of time (where Gautam Gambhir scored an epic match-saving 12-hour hundred in 2009). So, from my first tour (in 1990 till 2009), I realised pitches got harder with passage of time," Tendulkar said.


  Tendulkar is confident that the Indian bowling attack, spearheaded by Jasprit Bumrah, has the ammunition to put New Zealand in trouble.


  "We have a good bowling attack with quality fast bowlers as well as spinners. I believe we have the ammunition to compete in New Zealand."


  However, in Wellington, Tendulkar wants the team to be well-prepared to counter the breeze factor.


  "Wellington, I have played and it makes a huge difference if you are bowling with the wind or against the wind. The batsman needs to be judicious in the choice of which end he wants to attack, it is very important," he said.


  Tendulkar said he would prefer spinners to bowl against the breeze.


  "...the seamers bowling against the strong breeze need to be smart. So I would prefer that if there is strong breeze, let the spinner bowl from that end and from the opposite end, the fast bowler bowls with the breeze behind him," he said.


  The maestro is confident that Rohit Sharma's white ball experience will hold him in good stead in the Tests as well, an assignment that has been kept for the last leg of the trip, which begins with five T20 Internationals from January 24.


  "The challenge would be to go out and open in different conditions. I think Rohit had opened in New Zealand in ODIs and has been there quite a few times, he knows the conditions well. Eventually, Test cricket is Test cricket," he said.


  "But all depends on surfaces that they provide. If they provide green tops, then it's a challenge."


  There is no Bhuvneshwar Kumar or Deepak Chahar in limited-overs series but Tendulkar is not ready to press the panic button.


  "Injuries are part and parcel of the game when you play and push your body to the limits.


  "When you play for your country you need to give your best and while you give your best, you can get injured. That's okay," he concluded.

Insurance might impact the amount you need to have saved, Carlson said. A lot of these risks are insurable, but there is almost always going to be some out of pocket cost. Think about your auto, health, home and disability coverage and what would be the most you might have to pay out of pocket. For example, if you’re on a high deductible health plan, you might have to pay over $7,000 out of pocket before insurance will contribute anything. What if this health issue has also left you unable to work? Do you have disability insurance, and if so, when is the soonest you could collect on it?

When the Pratt Community College Beavers wrestling team headed into the Beaver Dome to take on the 18th ranked (in national community colleges) Neosho County Community College Panthers on Jan. 15, they didn't let the notoriety stop them from going head-to-head in each match with the impetus to win.   In a contest that saw the lead change several times, it came down to a tie at 18-all with just two matches to go. But a pin win for PCCs Luke Culbertson gave the Beavers the team lead, it gave the Beavers a big enough margin to come away with a 24-21 victory over the Panthers.   Coach Ken Kepley said he didn't worry about Neosho's ranking. He believes in his team and knows they will come out with intensity and look for openings.   This was the first dual meet of the season and Kepley said he could tell they were a little timid and that lead to some missed opportunities.   "We left a lot of points out there. We have work to do," Kepley said. "But I'm proud of their effort."   With this dual out of the way and more experience, the guys are ready to take on any opponent.   Culbertson's critical match that gave the Beavers the team lead wasn't going his way at first but with some very fast moves, he overcame Neosho's Cole Denny in the 165 and got the pin that gave the Beavers the cushion they needed to win.   "I've been looking for him (Culbertson) to win. I'm so glad for him," Kepley said. "He works hard every day. He always does what I ask him to."   While each match is an individual challenge, the Beavers know it takes the entire team to win a meet and they all work hard to make that happen. And sometimes, a wrestler will make a break through in a meet.   "Everyone is good. We don't care about accolades," Kepley said. "Luke (Culbertson) had no accolades and he got the biggest win of the night."   Kepley said every guy came to the dual with the attitude they were going to get a win. There was a great effort from everyone.   "I'm proud of the team. They've been through a lot," Kepley said.   Even in the matches they lost, the Beavers never gave up. They are showing a lot of confidence and ready to turn the corner.   The team gets right back to work as they prepare for their next dual with Labette Community College on Jan. 21. Kepley said they weren't going to change a thing in training. They'll pickup the pace, keep moving and fine tune in preparation for the meet. The team is showing good effort and Kepley sees them improving to a higher level.   "We're right there. We're ready to turn the corner," Kepley said.   The dual against Neosho started with Bobby Williams at 184 pounds struggling well but taking a loss. Then Bryce Moreland took a 6-1 decision win to get the Beavers back in the match. Then it was the heavyweights with Darious Wilkins taking the mat and getting a 7-3 decision win to put the Beavers ahead. At 125, Michael Spangler got a walk over win on a Panther forfeit due to injury. Max Bazan took on his opponent and refused to be pinned in 7-1 loss in the 133 weight class.   Then Jacob Mitchell had a tough bout at 141 and took a technical fall loss but also refused to be pinned. At 149 pounds, red shirt Jake Beeson got the Beavers back on the winning track with a pin win. Juan Urbina was the Beavers 157 wrestler and had a tough time, taking a 16-5 loss but like his other team members, refused to lose by a fall. This put the teams in an 18-18 tie with just two matches to go.   Then Culbertson came out in the 165 class and things weren't going his way when he suddenly made a quick move and got the pin win in the second period. That gave the Beavers a 24-18 lead with just one match to go. At 174, Misael Monarrez was the last wrestler of the match. He knew it would be a tough match because his opponent was No. 2 ranked Tyson Villalpando. Monarrez worked hard and although he lost the match 13-8, he, like his other team mates refused to be pinned and that gave the Beavers the 24-21 victory.

Some titanium oxides are known for their unique properties, such as increased photocatalytic activity (i.e. they effectively use light to speed up chemical reactions). Titanium oxide-based coatings are able to clean themselves under the influence of light. Moreover, they can potentially be used to purify air and water from harmful substances and to desalinate sea water. The same property has recently been found in nanomaterials based on titanium oxide (III). Among other things, titanium oxide (III) is able to change phase from a semiconductor to a metal. In the course of such a phase change it considerably increases its electrical conductivity when heated. Not only the level of conductivity, but even the relative position of atoms is subject to changing. One of the main goals of modern science is to look for structure-property patterns of this kind.

Organic self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) have been around for over forty years. The most widely used form is based on thiols, bound to a metal surface. However, although the thiol SAMs are very versatile, they are also chemically unstable. Exposure of these monolayers to air will lead to oxidation and breakdown within a single day. University of Groningen scientists have now created SAMs using buckyballs functionalized with 'tails' of ethylene glycol. These molecules produce self-assembled monolayers that have all the properties of thiol SAMs but remain chemically unchanged for several weeks when exposed to air. This robustness makes them much easier to use in research and in devices. An article about these new SAMs was published in _Nature Materials_ on 30 January.

Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national working president J.P. Nadda on Tuesday said the efficacy of democracy as a system of politics and governance is under a cloud the world over, and only the BJP could provide the grass roots reach expected of a national party in such a set-up.
 Without directly referring to the failures of the multi-party parliamentary democratic system in India, the BJP leader said when democracy as a system does not give the desired results, it raises concerns for society and the polity in general. Even in a country like Russia, democracy is in retreat and people have in recent polls suggested they would have preferred a different system from the past, Mr. Nadda said in conversation with thought leaders and members of industry.

The body of a missing law student was found burried in the basement of his former landlord in Girdhar Enclave in Sahibabad, police said on October 15.
 The victim Pankaj Singh (29) had been missing since October 9, Superintendent of Police Maneesh Mishra said. His former landlord Hariom alias Munna, along with his family is on the run since Saturday, they said, adding hunt is on to nab them.
 Singh had moved to another rented accommodation in Girdhar Enclave. He was also running a cyber cafe and making sizeable profit, which apparently nurtured greed in the accused, Hariom, who lived in the same locality, police said.
 They said Singh also used to give tuitions to students, including accused’s four children. When Singh went missing his younger brother Maneesh lodged a report at Sahibabad police station.
 During investigation it surfaced that the Hariom and his wife were pressuring Singh to sell his cyber cafe to them at a very low price, the police said. The police reached Hariom’s house on October 14 and found that the basement’s floor was renovated, they said. Later, Singh’s body was exhumed in the presence of a magistrate, the police said. According to the post-mortem report, he was strangled to death, they said.

The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) has grown spectacularly after 2010 when the BJP was working hard to come back to power and has added close to 20,000 _shakhas_ (assemblies) since then.
 “In 2009, we took the decision to expand our organisation across India. We experienced growth after 2010. Since then, 19,584 new _shakhas_ have joined us. At present, 57,411 _shakhas_ meet every morning across the country,” said Manmohan Vaidya, Saha Sarkaryavah, while addressing a press conference in Bhubaneswar on Wednesday.
 The three-day-long Akhil Bharatiya Karyakari Mandal got underway here from Wednesday. Top office-bearers of RSS including its chief Mohan Bhagwat and deputy chief Suresh Bhyaji Joshi, along with all regional heads of the organisation, are participating. The meeting will take stock of organisational activities, including plans of expansion and training of cadre.
 As many as 1,585 daily _shakhas_ were added since October last year. At present, weekly assemblies have reached 18,923, an addition of 1,879 in one year.
 “Between first four years from 2010 to 2014, only 6,000 _shakhas_ had joined us. After 2014, we have been rising continuously. Situation is favourable for growth and eagerness among people to connect with the Sangh is also increasing,” said Mr. Vaidya. Since 2014, RSS has been strengthened by addition of 13,584 _shakhas_.
 The RSS has an option on its website extending an invitation to join the organisation. From 2014 to 2016, the RSS was strengthened by addition of an average of 90,000 to 95,000 cadre annually. Since 2017, the average annual addition has been over one lakh. “This shows a rise in eagerness to join the RSS,” he said.
 Dispelling the impression of the RSS being an organisation of elders, Mr. Vaidya said the youth constituted 60% of total _shakhas_ and 29% were held by young traders. “Only 11% are having elders as members.”
 The RSS is now out to form new cadre-based wings to advise people on keeping the joint family system intact, saving the environment and sustaining farm- based local development.
 On the question of politics over the Ayodhya matter, Mr. Vaidya said, “The issue of Ram Temple is not a political one. It is a matter of faith of the whole Hindu society. The court verdict on the matter has been pending for long. It is better if it comes early.”
 “Even the abrogation of the Article 370 is not a political issue. As per the Constitution, it was a temporary article. All parties had extended their support to abrogate the article while participating in a private bill in 1994. There was national consensus. No government was taking a decision; this government took.”

For all the various protestations from John Kerry, Joe Biden, and Barry Obama that the Obama administration was “scandal-free,” it most certainly was not. By the current standards of impeachment, once Obama lost the House in 2011, he would have been impeached for “Obstruction of Congress” and “Abuse of Power” for the Fast and Furious scandal and for invoking “executive privilege” to justify administration officials’ refusal to testify to Congress. Also impeachable by the new standard: political corruption at the IRS that was sicced on conservative groups during the Obama reelection bid; the lies and obstruction about the Benghazi disaster; the hot-mic quid pro quo promise Obama made to the Russians that resulted in the dismantlement of Eastern Europe missile defense in exchange for Putin’s good behavior to the benefit of Obama’s reelection campaign; the abuse of executive orders to nullify federal immigration law; the failure to consult Congress on the prisoner swap with the Taliban; the lying under oath to Congress by both the CIA director and the director of national intelligence; the secret monitoring of the communications of Associated Press reporters and Fox’s James Rosen, along with former CBS reporter Sharyl Attkisson; the deliberate nullification of the constitutional treaty-making prerogative of the Senate during the Iran deal, whose secrete accords were never disclosed to the American people; and the warping of the CIA, DOJ, FBI, and National Security Council respectively, in their unethical and often illegal efforts to mislead the FISA courts, surveil the Trump campaign, unmask and leak the names of U.S. citizens whose communications were tapped, and disrupt a presidential transition.

Yes, Heath Ledger's Joker dominated the screen two decades ago, but another Batman villain has stolen the show in the past decade. In The Dark Knight Rises, Batman was challenged by Bane, a menacing villain thug. What sets him apart from other bad guys is that he was a master strategist and a crafty manipulator. He managed to get Gotham under his control, presented himself as a revolutionary and robbed the rich of their power. All of this was part of his plan to destroy Gotham once and for all. Although it later became known that the plan to destroy Gotham was not entirely his, he made everything possible. In addition, he effortlessly beat Batman in a fight and broke his back, something no other villain has done. Sure, you can make fun of his voice, but he's able to crush your larynx like a branch.
