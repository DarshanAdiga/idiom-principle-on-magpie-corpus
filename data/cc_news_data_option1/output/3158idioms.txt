Lo Spazio Sintesi ospiterà anche “Return” che propone alcune opere di Luciano Gaglio, artista palermitano trapiantato a Torino, a metà tra arte e design: costruzioni geometriche nei quali inserisce fili d’acciaio, perni e fonti luminose che ne esaltano la dimensione minimalista. Le sue opere sono un connubio tra arte e design; costruzioni regolari e geometriche alle quali sono applicati elementi industriali quali i fili di acciaio e i perni che fanno parte della progettualitàdelle opere, spesso associati a sorgenti luminose che esaltano la dimensione minimalista, l’essenza. Il titolo del progetto, Return, fa riferimento al ritorno dell’artista nella sua città natale, Palermo, dopo un lungo periodo di assenza.

"It is no accident that theatre and democracy were invented at the same time," said Barnaby Evans, Executive Artistic Director and coCEO of WaterFire Providence. "This is a time when the theatre's power to illuminate, humanize and share many perspectives and visions of the future is needed more than ever. Yet denied because the very real challenge of assuring everyone's safety in this time of COVID-19 is also critically important. At their heart both public health and theatre are guiding us with stories on how to best build our communities to be a better and stronger place for us all. We felt we had to creatively reinvent the theatre in light of public health by being guided by and serving both the science of health experts and the dramatic truth of our artists."

Lebanon's government resigned in the wake of a massive explosion that killed over 160 people and wounded thousands, leaving another 90,000 or so with ruined homes.
 It is a massive disaster that comes after other problems Lebanon was already facing, such as an economic crisis, COVID-19 and the stranglehold Hezbollah has on the country.
 On the one hand, the resignation of Prime Minister Hassan Diab and other, such as the Hezbollah-backed Health minister, appears to show the government is being held to account.
 It is after all the government that failed to do anything about a warehouse full of dangerous chemicals that exploded. Reports now indicate they were warned as recently as July.
 They were also warned by the US four years ago, and they've known about this problem since the ammonium nitrate arrived in 2013. Judges had even looked into the warehouse where the chemicals were stored, most recently since January 2020.
 Hassan Diab has only been in charge since January. He was tapped by President Michel Aoun last year after the former Prime Minister Saad Hariri resigned in October. He had backing from Hezbollah, the Shi'ite Amal movement, the Free Patriotic movement and others. He was opposed by the anti-Hezbollah parties.
 But what has changed? Hariri's resignation last year was unimportant. He had already resigned once in November 2017 while allegedly being coerced in Saudi Arabia to leave the government.
 What real effect does the Prime Minister have? Hariri accomplished little in his years in office. President Aoun is an aging former general from the civil war era. He is a Christian. In Lebanon's sectarian political order ones religion matters entirely in terms of who gets what in offices. The presidency is reserved specifically for Christians.
 For instance the Shi'ite speaker of parliament, Nabih Berri has been speaker since 1992 and is part of the Amal movement.
 Berri and Aoun, born in 1938 and 1935 respectively, are the old faces that run Lebanon. Aoun came to power in 2016 after Hezbollah successfully held the appointment of a new president hostage. The last president of Lebanon was Michel Suleiman, who served until 2014.
 But the President is not as powerful as the office once was prior to the Taif Accords that ended the civil war in 1989. For instance the system shifted from one that is more similar to former colonial power France, with a strong president appointing a Prime Minister, to a more powerful Prime Minister.
 The more powerful Prime Minister is Sunni and this is supposed to reflect demographic realities where the Christians are believed to be less than fifty percent of the population. Lebanon doesn't do a census because it would tip over the careful sectarian balance written into these agreements.
 But all the gerrymandering and careful sectarian logic, which has almost no parallels in the world, means that Lebanon is largely ungovernable.
 That is one reason a warehouse was kept full of chemicals at the port. It is why a massive extralegal terrorist group like Hezbollah de fact controls southern Lebanon, stockpiles 150,000 missiles, conducts Lebanon's foreign policy and military policy and has a role at the port and airport.
 So why would it matter if the Hezbollah-picked prime minister leaves. He is the fall guy, the scapegoat, and he will be replaced with some other boring technocrat who will do Hezbollah's bidding.
 There are many young voices in Lebanon who are tired of the aging leadership, the rule by clans and the presence of Hezbollah.
 But like in other countries, they don't have much say. For instance in Iraq a young movement also rose up against a similar paradigm.
 Iraq's Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi resigned last year after protesters were killed on his watch.
 But he was ineffectual and no one will remember him. The power behind the throne in Iraq is Hadi al-Amiri, the Shi'ite Badr organization leader. Besides him there is the cleric Muqtada al-Sadr and Ayatollah Sistani. And then, like Lebanon, there are sectarian politics such as a Sunni speaker of parliament, a Kurdish president and the various Kurdish parties.
 Diab is out. Hezbollah is still there. The protesters may be angry, but they won't have much influence.
 The region is still led by these men who came of age in the 1950s, men like Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas, and Aoun and Berri.
 Consider the fact that the formative years of these men was the 1950s when Gamal Abdel Nasser ruled Egypt and spoke via radio to the region.
 Most of them are placeholders, clinging to office, but with no real vision or desire to do anything. There's no evidence that a new Prime Minister, a new health minister supported by Hezbollah, will do more than the last one. Given the realities of Lebanese politics where sectarian parties - many run by powerful families - control everything, the chance of change is slim.

While former Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje’s reservation about the move to topple the government is believed to have slowed down the BJP’s plan, the Congress managed to ‘divide’ the Pilot camp by persuading eight-term MLA Bhanwar Lal Sharma to break ranks. Mr. Sharma later met party general secretary (organisation) K.C. Venugopal on Sunday. That meeting, a senior leader camping in Rajasthan argued, was a turning point to put pressure on Mr. Pilot to resolve the dispute.
 ## Devolution of power
 Though Mr. Gehlot will continue as Chief Minister, the party is likely to find a mechanism where there is devolution of power and make the governance structure more ‘participative’ to involve the elected MLAs, another leader said.

BEIRUT -- The 160-year-old palace withstood two world wars, the fall of the Ottoman Empire, the French mandate and Lebanese independence. After the country's 1975-90 civil war, it took 20 years of careful restoration for the family to bring the palace back to its former glory.
   
 "In a split second, everything was destroyed again," says Roderick Sursock, owner of Beirut's landmark Sursock Palace, one of the most storied buildings in the Lebanese capital.
   
 He steps carefully over the collapsed ceilings, walking through rooms covered in dust, broken marble and crooked portraits of his ancestors hanging on the cracked walls. The ceilings of the top floor are all gone, and some of the walls have collapsed. The level of destruction from the massive explosion at Beirut's port last week is 10 times worse than what 15 years of civil war did, he says.
   
 More than 160 people were killed in the blast, around 6,000 were injured and thousands of residential buildings and offices were damaged. Several heritage buildings, traditional Lebanese homes, museums and art galleries have also sustained various degrees of damage.
   
 The Sursock palace, built in 1860 in the heart of historical Beirut on a hill overlooking the now-obliterated port, is home to beautiful works of arts, Ottoman-era furniture, marble and paintings from Italy -- collected by three long-lasting generations of the Sursock family.
   
 The Greek Orthodox family, originally from the Byzantine capital, Constantinople -- now Istanbul -- settled in Beirut in 1714.
   
 The three-story mansion has been a landmark in Beirut. With its spacious garden, it's been the venue for countless weddings, cocktail parties and receptions over the years, and has been admired by tourists who visit the nearby Sursock museum.
   
 The house in Beirut's Christian quarter of Achrafieh is listed as a cultural heritage site, but Sursock said only the army has come to assess the damage in the neighborhood. So far, he's had no luck reaching the Culture Ministry.
   
 The palace is so damaged that it will require a long, expensive and delicate restoration, "as if rebuilding the house from scratch," Sursock says.
   
 Sursock has moved to a nearby pavilion in the palace gardens, but this has been his home for many years alongside his American wife, his 18-year-old daughter and his mother, Yvonne. He says the 98-year-old Lady Cochrane (born Sursock) had courageously stayed in Beirut during the 15 years of the civil war to defend the palace. His wife was just dismissed from hospital, as the blast was so powerful that the wave affected her lungs.
   
 Sursock says there is no point in restoring the house now -- at least not until the country fixes its political problems.
   
 "We need a total change, the country is run by a gang of corrupt people," he said angrily.
   
 Despite his pain and the damage from last week's blast, Sursock, who was born in Ireland, says he will stay in Lebanon, where he has lived his whole life and which he calls home.
   
 But he desperately hopes for change.
   
 "I hope there is going to be violence and revolution because something needs to break, we need to move on, we cannot stay as we are."
