As a result of stark contrast in consumer behavior and stringent regulations across the world pertaining to transportation during the pandemic, the global packaging sector is going through a turbulent phase. This is expected to reflect in the growth of the Hydrogel market, as operations are limited to essential activities and products, thereby creating a huge void in packaging needs for non-essential commodities. On this premise, the global Hydrogel market will experience a downtrend through the pandemic. Further complicating smooth operations are hindered operations and travel bans across the world. On the back of these factors, players operating in the global Hydrogel market are expected to experience a steep decline in revenue flow.

On April 10,1912 the Titanic sailed from South Hampton, England. She sank into the consciousness of the world just before midnight April 14,1912. 2,223 souls were on board. In three short hours 1,517 of those people perished while 706 survived. From that night came new Maritime laws. The number of life boats on board were indeed inadequate, but if the staff and crew had been trained, 65% of those who perished would have survived

EASTON -- For a decade, families have enjoyed strolling through the forest of holiday cheer at the annual Easton Festival of Trees.
 Despite the coronavirus pandemic, the festival will still go on this season, but will be brought virtually to residents' laptops and computer screens.
 The 10th annual Easton Festival of Trees, presented by the Easton Charitable Trust, will be available for streaming Sunday, Nov. 22, to Friday, Dec 11.
 Festival organizer Cathy Estey said the group usually starts planning for the December event in March, but this year held off as they waited for more information on guidelines or for the situation to improve.
 "We kept thinking next month we'd know more, things would get better," she said.
 Eventually the group considered canceling the festival for 2020.
 "As we started to contemplate skipping this year, people started saying 'Come on, we need something happy.' 'I look forward to this,'" Estey said. "But the one that really hit us was 'You help so many groups, these groups need your help, more than ever.'"
 So the trust decided to move forward. The festival usually draws 2,500 to 3,000 people and raises $25,000 to $35,000 for six or seven charities. With the response uncertain this year, the trust decided to choose just two recipients.
 "So we started focusing on what groups were really impacted this year," Estey said. "We also broke our rule of never doing a repeat (recipient)."
 The 2020 Festival of Trees' proceeds will go to School On Wheels Massachusetts, which provides academic support, mentoring and school supplies to children impacted by homelessness, and Massachusetts Vest-A-Dog, which helps provide bulletproof vests, equipment, training, and funds for law enforcement K9 programs.
 Estey said with the current impact on education by the pandemic students are in particular need of extra support this year from an organization like SOW. She also said Brockton is looking to add another K9 unit to its police department and can benefit from Vest-A-Dog.
 The Festival of Trees will be set up at the Easton Country Club as it has in the past, but viewing will be done virtually. A videographer will film the trees, and ticket purchases will receive a link to view them. There will still be a raffle to win the trees as well as a silent auction.
 The festival will only feature 25 trees this year, down from the usual 80 to 90, Estey said. Each tree usually has a special theme.
 Estey is decorating several trees herself.
 "I usually do four to six," she said.
 Her trees include a Nutcracker tree, a Children's Cookie Stand tree with baking supplies, a bicycle tree with a women's bike included and a rustic antique tree.
 Other trees this year will be Margaretville, the Grinch, as well as traditional holiday themes.
 "I think our group is extremely creative," Estey said. "The group is small but very talented."
 Those dining at the Easton Country Club will also get a glimpse of the trees.
 After a hit to business from the coronavirus pandemic and a fire at its Raynham restaurant, 2 Jerks BBQ launched a pop-up restaurant at Easton Country Club starting early June. The club normally used its dining rooms for weddings and functions, which were not taking place due to the coronavirus. When they heard of the fire they invited 2 Jerks BBQ to set up at the club, Easton Country Club general manager and co-owner Mark Lombardi said.
 "It was really a result of the pandemic," Lombardi said. "It's been a lot of fun."
 Throughout the summer, 2 Jerks BBQ offered outdoor dining and take-out at the club. The dining will continue into the winter inside.
 Lombardi said the Festival of Trees will be on view in the clubs' two dining rooms after Thanksgiving. One 3,000-square-foot room is also available for small holiday parties of under 25 people, he said.
 "For a couple weeks when you are dining you can enjoy the festive setting," he said.
 Tickets are $10 for the Easton Festival of Trees and will be available online Nov. 22. A link to view the trees, along with the option to purchase raffle tickets, will be available on at eastonfestivaloftrees.org.

 There's got to be a morning after if we can hold on through the night We have a chance to find the sunshine Let's keep on lookin' for the light ....
 These lyrics from the 1972 film The Poseidon Adventure echoes the hope of all people, during the darkest nights and days of insecurity. On April 10,1912 the Titanic sailed from South Hampton, England. She sank into the consciousness of the world just before midnight April 14,1912. 2,223 souls were on board. In three short hours 1,517 of those people perished while 706 survived. From that night came new Maritime laws. The number of life boats on board were indeed inadequate, but if the staff and crew had been trained, 65% of those who perished would have survived
 The staff should have been prepared for an emergency with assigned sections of the cabins. Their one job; handing out life vest, seeing the passengers were properly dressed and then shepherding them to their assigned life boat.
 If the crew had been trained in the proper use of the lifeboats they would have known how to seat the passengers, provided blankets and lowered them safely into the water. This should have came as naturally as a soldier cleaning his weapon. None of this occurred, it was total confusion.
 A baby could have been held. Small toddlers and children could have sat on laps or on the floor between the adults feet. A large percentage of the victims were children. Foot room would have been limited but isn't a child's life more important than comfort?
 Being prepared is the main ingredient in surviving. Today we are in as precarious position as the those passengers. On the Titanic, and today with the virus, there are those who do not believe there is danger. I have heard educated people blowing off the virus as junk news.
 There are those in a panic who either hole up or put a brave face on and pretend nothing is wrong. Then, there are those who defies the mask rule, go to large gatherings and pretend all is normal. There are those who have given up, they have gone to their cabins to wait the inevitable, while others cling to the belief that a miracle cure will be discovered.
 We need to learn the lessons from the Titanic. We need to be prepared to fight this battle intelligently and knowledgeably. Get your flu shot and pneumonia shot. It won't immunize you against the big virus but it will help you survive the other flues that stalk us through the winter.
 Wear a mask, sanitize and avoid massive gatherings. Social distance and keep your body strong with vitamins, healthy foods and don't smoke anything to weaken the lungs. Let's be on the lifeboats emerging from the dark, cold night into the light of a new day. This will pass in time, but until then be smart...there's got to be a morning after, a new dawn...a new day. Let's pray we all will see it and be a part of it.

Career and technical education is viewed as a gateway to good jobs. But a new Hechinger/AP analysis on enrollment data from 40 states finds a deep racial divide in who benefits. The analysis shows Black and Latino students were often less likely than their white peers to enroll in science, technology, engineering and math and information technology classes. Meanwhile, they were more likely to enroll in courses in hospitality and, in the case of Black students in particular, human services. The analysis was based primarily on data from 2017-18. States will be required to report the data to the federal government. Previously enrollment data was only required to be reported by gender.
