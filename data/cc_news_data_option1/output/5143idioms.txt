WASHINGTON (AP) — Top Washington negotiators continued to reach for a long-delayed agreement on COVID-19 relief on Monday, but rank-and- file Democrats appeared increasingly resigned to having to drop, for now, a scaled-back demand for fiscal relief for states and local governments whose budgets have been thrown out of balance by the pandemic.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., spoke with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin by phone Monday evening and continues to press for help for struggling states and localities. But top Democratic allies of President-elect Joe Biden came out in support of a $748 billion plan offered by a bipartisan group of lawmakers and hinted they won’t insist on a pitched battle for state and local aid now.“We cannot afford to wait any longer to act. This should not be Congress’ last COVID relief bill, but it is a strong compromise that deserves support from both Republicans and Democrats in the Senate,” said Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del. “We cannot leave for the holidays without getting relief to those Americans who need it.”The message from Coons, a confidant of Biden, and a similar message from Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., came as a bipartisan group of lawmakers unveiled a detailed COVID-19 aid proposal on Monday in hopes it would serve as a model for their battling leaders to follow as they try to negotiate a final agreement.But the group was unable to forge a compromise on GOP-sought provisions shielding businesses from COVID-related lawsuits, a key priority of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. The Kentucky Republican is pressing a lowest-common-denominator approach that would drop the lawsuit shield idea for now if Democrats agree to drop a $160 billion state and local aid package.Pelosi has insisted for months that state and local aid would be in any final bill, but as time is running out, Democrats appear unwilling to hold the rest of the package hostage over the demand. Several Democrats appeared at the bipartisan news conference endorsing the $748 billion package.“I found it interesting that they separated out the state and local and liability provisions. Senator McConnell had suggested that earlier,” said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas. “Seems to me that we’re making some progress on it.”Cornyn, a McConnell lieutenant, spoke after a dozen or so lawmakers unveiled two bills. One is a $748 billion aid package containing money for struggling businesses, the unemployed, schools and vaccine distribution. There is also $45 billion for transportation and transit assistance, funding for rural internet service and help for the Postal Service, among other provisions. The other bill proposes a $160 billion aid package for state and local governments and a modified liability shield that is backed by Republicans and Democratic moderate Joe Manchin of West Virginia, but it is probably too politically freighted to advance.The path forward for their proposals — and for COVID-19 aid more generally — remains unclear, though Cornyn said the bipartisan plan has lots of “good stuff” for any yearend agreement.Any agreement is likely to be forged in parallel negotiations between Pelosi and Mnuchin — closely watched by McConnell.Outstanding issues in the leadership talks include a potential second round of direct payments to individuals, a plan for $300-per-week bonus unemployment benefits, state and local aid, and the GOP-sought liability shield against COVID-19-related lawsuits.Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said she hoped that top Capitol Hill leaders and the administration will use the proposals as the basis for a COVID-relief package “that is urgently needed by our struggling families, our hard-hit small businesses, our stressed-out health care providers, our overwhelmed Postal Service, our challenged schools, and so many others.”Lawmakers also worked to finalize a yearend catchall funding package that will be the basis for the last significant legislation of the Trump presidency.There’s a hoped-for deadline of midnight Friday to deliver the completed package to President Donald Trump, which is when a partial government shutdown would arrive with the expiration of last week’s temporary funding bill. But there’s no guarantee that the massive yearend measure will be completed in time. If the talks drag, further temporary bills could be needed.Negotiations on the $1.4 trillion catchall spending bill are “essentially finished,” said a congressional aide participating in the talks. While details are closely held, “the status quo is prevailing.” That means Trump would get another $1.4 billion or so for a final installment to continue construction of his long-sought U.S.-Mexico border wall.Republicans have succeeded in killing a $12 billion plan to break last year’s budget mini- agreement by using accounting maneuvers to pad veterans health care funding to accommodate big cost increases from expanding access to health care services from private providers. Instead, a different set of moves is being employed to provide for equivalent spending increases for other domestic programs.The post-election lame-duck session is the last chance to wrap up the unfinished work this year, a goal of all involved, though they have been slow until now to forge the often-tricky compromises required to pull the measure together.Pelosi has not thrown in the towel on her drive to obtain state and local aid, which was part of the almost $2 trillion CARES Act that passed the Senate unanimously in March. But many Republicans are adamantly against the idea now.President-elect Joe Biden wants as much COVID relief as possible but has no direct influence on the negotiations. While he’ll empower Democrats after taking office next year, GOP leaders like McConnell are playing hardball and have forced Pelosi to scale back her demands. And while McConnell supported a $300-per-week bonus unemployment benefit this summer, he’s pulled back since the November election.No. 2 House Democrat Steny Hoyer of Maryland displayed flexibility in an appearance on CNN on Sunday that Republicans interpreted as a harbinger of further Democratic retreat.“The legislative process is a give and take and the items that I just mentioned are absolutely critical to get done, and although I think state and local assistance is critically important, the others are critically important too,” Hoyer said.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

CURWENSVILLE — A owner of multiple properties in Curwensville Borough will be fined because he didn’t follow through with the borough’s vacant property review board’s mandate.
 At its meeting Dec. 8, the committee authorized fining the owner for 30 days and starting the clock for 120 days. If the owner fails to provide the requested documents at the end of that period, the committee will recommend to council it vote to approve having all the properties demolished
 At its November meeting, the committee voted unanimously to require owner Matt Rowles to enter into a notarized agreement of sale for properties on Bloomington Avenue, Center Street and Thompson Street or submit a detailed plan of action along with an agreement with a contractor for remediation of those properties.
 Those properties have a number of issues that currently render them uninhabitable, although the borough’s code enforcement Officer Tom Carfley said he believes they can be repaired.
 Rowles attended the meeting. He provided the committee with cost estimates for each property, but no indication of the repairs each amount would cover.
 “We asked for a detailed plan. Code Enforcement Officer Carfley provided the committee with a list of violations that were also provided to you. These blanket amounts do not state what repairs they will cover,” Chairman Hildred Rowles said, adding, “The information requested is not there in black and white. The committee needs to know everything the amount will cover. You had 30 days to complete the plan and get the numbers together or provide a bill of sale for the properties.”

Almost no matter what, Peoples-Jones will exceed his draft status if he sticks around as a return man and occasional big-play threat. A sixth-round pick doesn't require more to have returned value, and Peoples-Jones has already shown what he can do in a bit role.


  There's some uncertainty surrounding Cleveland about what will happen with Odell Beckham Jr., but that's a matter for the offseason. Whether Peoples- Jones is what he is or unlocks his untapped upside might be a matter for a season down the road, too.


  There are two things for certain about Peoples-Jones, though. One, he won't be the best sixth-round pick ever taken out of Michigan (Tom Brady's got that locked up). And two, he'll be one of the best athletes in a league full of them for as long as he puts on the orange and brown of Cleveland.

The year, students from the Berlin Middle High School Key Club and the Berlin K-Kids made 350 ornaments to include with the dinners.


  “They’re such a neat little blessing for everyone coming through,” Thomas said of the ornaments.


  In addition to the Community Cafe, there is also the Feeding Hope food pantry. The pantry is the largest in Coos County. Haynes said the pantry is available to anyone who needs food with no questions asked. Demand on the pantry is up as well.


  If the need is great, Thomas and Haynes said so is the support from the Berlin-Gorham community. The cafe and food pantry run on grants and donations from local businesses, residents and agencies. Donations have been up as the pandemic has increased the economic hardship.


  “We’ve seen a huge outpouring of support from our community,” said Haynes. “It has just been wonderful to see.”


  He said people check on neighbors and elderly residents and bring meals to shut-ins or those not able drive to pick up meals. Without the social connection offered by the sit down dinner, Haynes said emotional health is a concern.


  He tries to talk with someone in every vehicle that goes through the pick-up line to check on how people are doing. While the contact is brief, Haynes said it gives him a sense of those that may be in trouble.


  Winter can be a challenging time of year with heating costs added to the financial burden facing families. It is also tough to conduct a drive-up meal giveaway when temperatures dip below zero degrees.


  Haynes said the Community Cafe will continue doing so for at least another month and then may have to get creative. But his faith makes him confident that they will continue to find a way to help those in need.

The Ravens have a few injuries of their own to contend with, but on the whole, they are as healthy as they have been in a while.

JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) - After Friday’s unanimous decision by the U.S. Supreme Court to reject a Texas lawsuit that would have overturned election results in four states, disenfranchising millions of voters in the process, one of that lawsuit’s supporters vows that the fight against alleged election fraud isn’t over.“Many south Mississippians, myself included, have repeatedly expressed their deep concerns of voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election,” U.S. Rep. Steven Palazzo, a Republican representing Mississippi’s fourth congressional district, said in an emailed statement to WLBT. “It is unfortunate the Supreme Court chose not to take up the case, but that does not mean this fight is over. At the end of the day, my goal is to restore voter confidence and trust in our electoral system.”Palazzo is one of 126 House Republicans, three from Mississippi, who signed an amicus brief supporting the Texas lawsuit which sought to delay Monday’s electoral vote in Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin because the suit claimed voting procedures in those states violated their own laws.Palazzo’s support came after Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch, also a Republican, announced she was joining the lawsuit with at least a dozen other states last week. Fitch, who announced her decision through a social media statement, has not spoken publicly about the matter since SCOTUS declined to hear the case Friday.Neither Fitch nor her communications director responded to a request for comment by 3 On Your Side Monday.WLBT also reached out to U.S. Rep. Michael Guest and U.S. Rep. Trent Kelly, two congressmen representing Mississippi who also supported the Texas suit. Guest’s communications director directed us to statements Guest made before the SCOTUS decision, where he justified his decision to sign the amicus brief.“If the court finds that these elected officials overstepped their Constitutional duties and, therefore, tainted their states’ elections, we must focus on restoring the integrity of the electoral process that was found to be undermined,” Guest, who also served as the district attorney of Madison and Rankin counties before being elected to Congress, said Thursday in a prepared release.Kelly’s office did not return a call for comment on the issue. Some of Mississippi’s Republican leaders echo Palazzo’s statement, saying they’re still waiting on other lawsuits that aim to prove fraud in the 2020 presidential election.“Obviously, we were very disappointed on Friday. And so there’s other cases out there that are going to work through the court system. And so we’ll see where this thing ends up,” said Frank Bordeaux, chairman of the Mississippi Republican Party. “We were definitely going to continue to make sure that the validity of the race is there.”Bordeaux served as one of six of the state’s electors, casting his vote for President Donald Trump Monday in a special ceremony at the State Capitol.During the event, Secretary of State Michael Watson and Gov. Tate Reeves, both Republicans, told reporters the state’s record turnout this year and double-digit increase in absentee votes showed a renewed faith in the electoral process and Mississippi’s commitment to free and fair elections.That enthusiasm wanes when those same officials talk about other states, a suspicion stemming from election fraud claims made by Trump and his legal team in the days after the Nov. 3 election. Has that suspicion waned since that SCOTUS decision?Neither Bordeaux nor Reeves would acknowledge Joe Biden winning the election, with the governor deferring at that time to the electoral college which was still casting votes across the nation.Bordeaux, however, said he’ll wait even longer.“I think that we don’t need to rush the process. I think that we’ll have a clear decision that it will be made by the voters on January 20, whenever whoever is elected,” Bordeaux said. “And if it’s Joe Biden, then Joe Biden will be our president. If it’s Donald Trump, then Donald Trump will be our president.”Reeves said if election fraud took place through illegal voting, regardless of which state in which it occurred, the will of Mississippi’s voters become disenfranchised.“I personally think that the disenfranchising of voters in Mississippi or Texas or any other state would occur if there was widespread voter fraud that could change the outcome of the election,” Reeves said.Reeves told reporters the role of judges is to interpret the laws as they’re written, not write the laws, when asked about Fitch’s role in the lawsuit and its merits.“I think that we’ve got in certain jurisdictions around America, we’ve got a federal judiciary that is certainly willing to be very activist. And I think that’s a problem,” Reeves said. At that point, Mississippi Today reporter Bobby Harrison asked him for specific examples of those activist judges.“Where’d they do that, Governor?” Harrison asked.“I’m just saying in general, in a lot of places across America, we have activist judges,” Reeves said.Harrison asked Reeves to name one place, but the governor never did.“It’s not unique to elections, Bobby. It’s actually, it’s in virtually every scope of government,” Reeves said. “You’ve got activists, federal judges, typically appointed by very liberal Democrats who want to put their own opinion in place of the voters of a particular state or jurisdiction.”Reeves said he assumed the U.S. Supreme Court interpreted the law in that Friday decision, a court where Republican-appointed justices outnumber Democrat-appointed ones, but wouldn’t say whether he agreed with that decision.“I don’t think judges that are appointed by conservatives should be expected to make a political decision whenever there is a lawsuit before them. I want them to interpret the law. I assume that they did so in this case,” Reeves said.Copyright 2020 WLBT. All rights reserved.

UConn coach Geno Auriemma wasn't surprised that the NCAA women's basketball tournament will be played in one geographical area. It just makes the most sense.
 The NCAA announced Monday that San Antonio is the likely host site for the 64-team tournament next March.

Hansen, who has been a stalwart on the defensive side of the football, which is what Smith was known for and coached that unit since former defensive coordinator Hardy Nickerson stepped away from the program for personal reasons two seasons ago.
 Although Hansen respected who Smith was and what he did as a coach at Illinois, he says that Lovie wasn’t the main reason that he committed to Illinois.
 “When I made my commitment to Illinois, I did it because of the school, not necessarily the coach,” Hansen said. “Yes, Lovie Smith was a name that resonated with football players all over, but college football is a business no matter what anybody says and thinks. It turns out that we just weren’t productive enough when he (Smith) was here and that wasn’t good enough.”
 Hansen will weigh his options with his family before making a decision to either come back for his extra year of eligibility or move on to the next level, but regardless of the decision that he makes, he knows that Smith has prepared him well.
 “He has coached in the NFL and really taught me a lot about what you need to do to play at that level, and in the end, I can’t say that I would want to trade the experience in to go someplace else,” Hansen said.
 Kramer, who has been on the offensive line during Smith’s entire tenure, said that he and the other co-captains were able to address the rest of the team on Monday following the news. Kramer also confirmed that AD Whitman was in the room when the announcement was made as Lovie Smith addressed the team one final time as their coach.
 “He gave me a chance when not many other coaches did, and I’m forever grateful for that, Kramer said. “Illinois was my dream school growing up and when it looked like that dream wouldn’t be realized, he came in and gave me the opportunity. He was a man that was levelheaded and I learned a lot from him because of that, but the situation is not ideal and we’ll miss him, but life goes on and we need to keep pushing forward.”
 Offensive coordinator Rod Smith will coach the team on an interim basis in their final regular season game on Saturday at Penn State, and Kramer acknowledged that this situation is a strange one to be in.
 “In my five years here, I thought I had seen everything,” Kramer said. “But this is a new situation for all of us having a different coach lead us in the last game, but we have to just take the situation for what it is worth and move ahead”
 Added Hansen, “Coach (Rod) Smith kind of fired me up today when he met with us, and I’m ready to go out to Penn State and see what we can do.”
 A trademark phrase that Lovie used to say frequently was “sometimes divorce is good”. Well, in this case, it may be good for the program in the long run, but the players have lasting impressions of the coach that led them into battle for the last few seasons.

BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (WBRC) - Another grim milestone in the coronavirus pandemic.300,000 people have died from COVID-19 in the United States.One mother is heartbroken over the death of her two daughters but remains hopeful for the future as vaccines are on the way.“I cry night and day, and to be without my daughters on the holidays, it is so hard, it is so hard. I don’t wish it on anyone,” said Mellie Nese Dudley.This will be the first Christmas she will spend without her two daughters, Dr. Angela Lowery and Phyllis Floyd--both losing the battle with COVID-19 this past summer.“Both of their kidneys just went out on them. And when I was praying that they both would come home, then all of a sudden, they were gone,” Dudley explained.Through the hurt and the pain, Dudley finds healing through her faith and helping others.“What really encourages me is to give…and you know…it can’t replace my daughters, but it will help someone else and that’s the thing that’s keeping me going,” Dudley said.She’s optimistic about Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine.She said she wishes it had been around to save her daughters but hopes it will keep others from feeling the unthinkable loss she’s experienced.“Things will be better before long, but if we continue to do the same things and not take the injections, what will this world be like?” Dudley said.Dudley said she’s getting through this tough time with prayer and support from her friends.She encourages people to continue wearing their masks and social distance until the vaccine is widely available.Copyright 2020 WBRC.

Statistically speaking, and to the outside eye, West Virginia’s shooting performance in the first half of an 87-71 conquest of No. 19 Richmond on Sunday may have seemed uncharacteristically good.
 But even though the team was shooting just 39.9% heading into the game and hit shots at a 65.7% clip in the opening 20 minutes, Mountaineer coach Bob Huggins didn’t see anything unusual at all.
 To him, Sunday’s shooting performance was more indicative of what his team is and should be all the time.
 “They’ve shot like that in practice pretty much all along,” Huggins said. “I don’t think it was a matter of them looking like they were hot, they were just normal.”
 It’s certainly a tantalizing thought — what would the No. 8-ranked Mountaineers (6-1) look like if their shooting more closely resembled Sunday’s first half than Friday’s first half against North Texas, when the team shot just 25.7%?
 The simple answer, obviously, is that WVU would be among the nation’s top teams if it isn’t already. But it’s not necessarily as simple as shots going in and shots not going in.
 The end result was more the culmination of several things the Mountaineers did better. The team’s ball movement was better. Its defense and transition offense off of that defense was better.
 According to point guard Miles McBride, some of it was really just about effort and focus.
 “The North Texas game … we didn’t have any intensity,” McBride said. “I think our intensity in the first half [against Richmond] is something that we need every game for all 40 minutes. I think if I can start that off and others can feed off it, we’re going to be hard to beat.”
 Individually, Sunday’s game was a nice rebound for McBride in particular as he led West Virginia with 20 points after scoring just six — a season low — against the Mean Green. Now a sophomore and arguably as explosive offensively as any player on the WVU roster, McBride is being relied upon for that production.
 Sunday was certainly an encouraging sign as he faced off with Richmond point guard Jacob Gilyard, the reigning Atlantic 10 defensive player of the year. McBride hit 9 of 11 shots from the floor, with five assists and just one turnover.

Panthers veteran cornerback Rasul Douglas got beat twice on double moves by Broncos rookie wide receiver KJ Hamler for touchdowns of 37 and 49 yards. Yes, Douglas should have had safety help over the top in Cover 3 on the 49-yard score, but he still wasn’t close enough to the receiver after biting on the move. Douglas had been one of the team’s top success stories earlier this season, but now finds himself struggling to keep a spot on the field. Donte Jackson and Troy Pride started at cornerback against the Broncos.

If the Eagles were looking for a spark at quarterback by starting rookie Jalen Hurts in favor of benched Carson Wentz in Week 14 vs. the Saints, then one would say they got that and then some — an upset win that kept their faint NFC playoff hopes alive at 4-8-1.


  Philadelphia got what it needed out of its second-round pick as it held on for a 24-21 home victory after getting out to a 17-0 halftime lead. Hurts wasn't close to perfect as a passer (17 of 30, 167 yards, one touchdown, 5.6 yards per attempt, 83.6 rating), but he avoided mistakes when the game was on the line. He more than compensated as a runner (18 carries, 106 yards).

OGDEN — The decision last week by Ogden officials to disperse the homeless encampment on 33rd Street struck Loveena Winkelkotter as unfair.
 "They're not given any support. They're just told they need to leave," she said. "You can't tell someone to leave if there's nowhere for them to go."
 Her dismay and discord among others over the forced removal of the tent city encampment spurred a small demonstration Monday on Washington Boulevard, across from the Ogden municipal building. Around 10 people gathered, variously advocating for the homeless and what they say should be the right of the homeless to gather and form encampments.
 "I'm just hoping to open a few eyes," said James Gilbery, another participant.
 He's long advocated for the homeless and those in need, conducting clothing collection drives to help out. In fact, Gilbery, a barber, had made various trips to the 33rd Street encampment to donate food, blankets and clothes and said some there were leery of moving in to homeless shelters due to concerns about contracting COVID-19 or fear of sexual assault. Now, he went on, "they're just kind of spread all over, which is a sad thing."
 Malik Dayo, an Ogden advocate for social causes who organized Monday's demonstration, said the homeless dispersed should have the right to return to the 33rd Street location and recreate the encampment. He called on those opposed to last week's action to voice their displeasure with Ogden Mayor Mike Caldwell and Ogden City Council members.
 "They're not separate from our community. They're part of our community," he said of the homeless.
 Dayo also cited COVID-19 guidelines for the homeless crafted by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Those guidelines read, in part, that if other housing options aren't available, those living in encampments should be allowed to remain.
 "Clearing encampments can cause people to disperse throughout the community and break connections with service providers. This increases the potential for infectious disease spread," read the CDC guidelines.
 Police and shelter officials have previously told the Standard-Examiner that Lantern House and other facilities for the homeless in Ogden have space available and can accommodate more people.
 The guidelines also encourage allowing 12 square feet of space per person, helping ensure access to restroom facilities and more.
 Gilbery had never before seen such a large-scale encampment in Ogden in such a visible public space, along the edge of 33rd Street outside the Lantern House homeless shelter. Typically, the homeless here scatter to wooded areas, out of the publie eye.
 Ogden officials say the encampment — which grew to perhaps 30 tents and other makeshift structures and as many as 60 people — had gradually taken shape in recent months. The move to disperse those at the location followed a lower-key approach of periodically asking the homeless to temporarily remove their tents and makeshift homes from beside the street so city crews could clean the location. After the cleanup efforts, the homeless would return.
 In deciding to make them move once and for all, officials cited increased health concerns brought on by unsanitary conditions at the site and reports of assaults and other criminal activity. City representatives and advocates for the homeless worked with the encampment tenants, directing them to homeless shelters and other services at their disposal. Some accepted offers of help, others didn't.
 "Many went to the Lantern House (which at the time had nearly 200 beds available). Others were picked up by family and or friends," Lt. Brian Enyon of the Ogden Police Department said in a message Monday to the Standard- Examiner. "Some were already staying at the Lantern House and removed their property from the street/sidewalk. In some instances, individuals were transported by the police to various service locations."
 Participants in Monday's demonstration had initially talked of temporarily putting up tents along the sidewalk on Washington Boulevard as a show of solidarity with the homeless. Authorities warned they could be cited for putting up structures on public accesses without a permit, though.
 In the end, the demonstrators sat on the ground, stood and sat on folding chairs on the sidewalk on the west side of Washington Boulevard between 25th and 26th streets. Dayo said Ogden police representatives brought the demonstrators water and hats for the cold.

LAMOINE, Maine — Kasey Jordan has been busy sewing maks since March when the coronavirus pandemic started. The 17-year-old is a junior at Mount Desert Island High School, and when she is not focused on schoolwork, Kasey is sewing masks with her mother and troop leader, Lori Jordan. Lori taught Kasey how to make a face mask from scratch. With her help, they have made almost 6,000 masks.      "We've sent a lot of masks to different places in the state of Maine and also out of the state of Maine," Kasey Jordan said.
