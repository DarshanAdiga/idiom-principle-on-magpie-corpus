With his team leading 94-92, Embbid turned the ball over on a cross-court pass and Brown scored on the other end and drew a foul for a 3-point play to put the Celtics ahead for good with 1:37 left. On the ensuing possession Tatum blocked Embiid from behind and the 76ers were called for a clear path foul on the other end, giving the Celtics two foul shots and the ball. Tatum made 1 of 2, and Walker followed with a killer step-back jumper over the top of Al Horford en route to a 10-0 run.

Child maltreatment is a global phenomenon that affects the lives of millions of children. Worldwide, as many as one in three to six children encounter physical, sexual, or emotional abuse from their caregivers. Children who experience abuse often show alterations in stress reactivity. Although this alteration may reflect a physiological survival response, it can nevertheless be harmful in the long run-increasing children's disruptive behavior and jeopardizing their development in multiple domains. But can we undo this process in at-risk children? Based on several lines of pioneering research, we hypothesize that we indeed can. Specifically, we hypothesize that highly dysfunctional parenting leads to an epigenetic pattern in children's glucocorticoid genes that contributes to stress dysregulation and disruptive behavior. However, we also hypothesize that it is possible to "flip the methylation switch" by improving parenting with known-effective parenting interventions in at-risk families. We predict that improved parenting will change methylation in genes in the glucocorticoid pathway, leading to improved stress reactivity and decreased disruptive behavior in children. Future research testing this theory may transform developmental and intervention science, demonstrating how parents can get under their children's skins-and how this mechanism can be reversed.

Mikel Arteta has warned Arsenal fans that William Saliba is not quite ready for the first-team, with many expecting the defender to make his debut today.
 Our side made the short trip across London today to take on Fulham in the Premier League’s opening fixture, but despite a number of defenders on the sideline, Saliba was a surprise omission.
 Manager Arteta has now revealed that he will take ‘some time’ before he will be ready to make his mark on the first-team.
 “I think it’s going to take him [Saliba] some time to adapt to our way of playing but as well to get adapted to the language, the rhythm, the physicality of the country,” MA told reporters prior to kick-off (via DailyStar).
 The Spaniard goes onto claim that his absences during the previous season and his injuries have also had a negative effect, before later hinting at further additions at centre-half.
 “As well we have to bear in mind that he didn’t play much football last season with all the injuries he had,” the Gunners boss added.
 “So, I think it will be a process that we have to be patient, picking the right games with the right environment and trying to grow because he [Saliba] has a really good potential.
 “Everyone was saying that we had too many central defenders and it’s a funny case right now that it’s the position we are short at the moment with all the injuries.
 “But I’m hopeful in the next few weeks that situation will resolve and we’ll be in a stronger position.”
 Rob Holding, Sokratis and Calum Chambers have all been linked with exits this summer, but Arteta’s comments seem to hint that we will need further additions to the squad, not departures, and I can’t help but feel that Arteta expected Saliba to be able to make the step up to the first-team squad prior to pre- season.
 How telling is it that Saliba wasn’t deemed ready for the squad, but Gabriel Magalhaes was ready to start today despite only limited time training with the squad?

The end of his nine-year stay with the Carolina Panthers arrived last March 24, leaving Cam Newton a former most valuable player without a team.
 For three months after that move was made, the quarterback waited for a new door to open as he turned 31, but no takers were found through the NFL free agency process.
 "Pressure is when you're looking at your children and you're saying you're 31 and you're not ready to retire, but nobody's calling your phone,'' said Newton. "That's pressure when you don't have control of your destiny.''
 The long wait for a new opportunity arrived on the final weekend of June, though, when the Patriots agreed to a one-year contract with Newton.
 Not long before the start of training camp, a team that had lost legend Tom Brady to free agency brought in Newton, who was waived by the Panthers after dealing with injuries the past two seasons.
 And on Sunday afternoon at an empty Gillette Stadium, Newton will be starting against the Miami Dolphins after being unsure what the future held for him back in the spring.
 "I'm elated, I'm excited because I knew that if God didn't show favor over me, man, who knows where I would be right now,'' said Newton on a video conference this week. "And yet through it all, I'm going to smile through it because I'm going to love this whole moment. I just got rewarded with another chance and I've got to do right by it.
 "Two or three months ago, I was questioning a lot of things. Right now, as I'm looking at Gillette (Stadium name), and the iconic logo of the Patriots, how can I lose, know what I'm saying?
 "I was at my house working out every single day, and God has put me in this position I would not take for granted. I pray countless nights, I meditated countless days. I had so much counsel from my support cast.''
 Newton, who led the Panthers to the Super Bowl in 2015 when he was the NFL's MVP, missed the final two games of the 2018 season with a shoulder injury that required surgery.
 He started the first two games of the 2019 season but struggled and sat out the remaining 14 games due to a foot injury that needed surgery last December.
 The Panthers decided not to bring him back in 2020, giving Newton the chance to work out a trade, but after that didn't happen, he was waived in late March with the team saving $19 million in salary cap space.
 The Patriots had second-year quarterback Jarrett Stidham and journeyman Brian Hoyer as the players in line to replace Brady, but they saw Newton still on the free-agent market as summer began and brought him in.
 Only three other quarterbacks have started for the Patriots since Brady replaced an injured Drew Bledsoe early in the 2001 season, and now Newton will be taking over for the first-ballot Hall of Famer who is now with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
 "I've been here going on a month and a half,'' said Newton. "I'm ready. I know opening day, (Brady is) not going to really be worried about little old me and I know opening day I just have other things to be focusing on other than who was here before.
 "I have to do right by my opportunity that I do get and make the most of it.''
 Newton will become just the second Black quarterback to start a game for the Patriots, joining Jacoby Brissett, who started two games in the 2016 season when Brady was suspended and Jimmy Garoppolo was injured.
 Newton talked about growing up in Atlanta and how Michael Vick was his hero and how he looked up to other Black quarterbacks like Vince Young, Randall Cunningham, Donovan McNabb and Daunte Culpepper, among others.
 He knows the significance of being a Black quarterback in the NFL and for the Patriots, who played their first game 60 years ago this week at Boston University.
 "It's a big deal. It's really a big deal,'' said Newton. "I understand who I am. I understand being an African-American in this time, we have to be stronger. This is a great feat to achieve, but yet at the end of the day we've got to make sure we're using our platform for positive reasons and that's what I want to do.
 "I want to prove to people that there's more to a person than just what you see on the outer level. I'm a person who got second and third and fourth chances in my life and yet through it all, it should always be about what that person's about, not what that person looks like.
 "As long as I have this opportunity to impact and empower the community whether it's the Black community or the white community, it doesn't matter what community it may be, I just want to do my part as a good Samaritan.''
 Newton said his excitement level is at "1,000'' going into his first game since a Sept. 12, 2019 loss to the Buccaneers.
 He sat out 16 of the last 18 games with the Panthers due to injuries, so there is rustiness to deal with, especially after a shortened training game with no preseason games.
 "You've got to remember, I've been away from football for really a full year, 16 games,'' said Newton. "I missed the last two games of 2018 and only played two games of 2019, so that's an equivalent of a 16 games, so I haven't really had this whole process for a long time now.
 "Being around, taking notes, watching film, finding out about different players each and every day, locking in, (I'm) excited about the game plan and more excited about just trying to get in a routine with the newness of the play calling, the coaches and the players.''
 "I think right now where I'm at, I'm in a happy place. I feel motivated. I feel just a lot of great emotions that's going on that's not hindering me from becoming my best self. And yet through it all, I just like it most that I'm just a piece to the puzzle. I don't want to be the puzzle.''

SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (AP) — Coronavirus infections in the Dakotas are growing faster than anywhere else in the nation, fueling impassioned debates over masks, personal responsibility and freedom after months in which the two states avoided the worst of the pandemic. The argument over masks raged this week in Brookings, South Dakota, as the city council considered requiring face coverings in businesses. The city was forced to move its meeting to a local arena to accommodate intense interest, with many citizens speaking against it, before the mask requirement ultimately passed. Amid the brute force of the pandemic, health experts warn that the infections must be contained before care systems are overwhelmed. North Dakota and South Dakota lead the country in new cases per capita over the last two weeks, ranking first and second respectively, according to Johns Hopkins University researchers. The states have also posted some of the country's highest positivity rates for COVID-19 tests in the last week — nearly 22 percent in North Dakota — an indication that there are more infections than tests are catching. Infections have been spurred by schools and universities reopening and mass gatherings like the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally, which drew hundreds of thousands of people from across the country. “It is not a surprise that South Dakota has one of the highest (COVID-19) reproduction rates in the country,” Brookings City Council member Nick Wendell said as he commented on the many people who forgo masks in public. The Republican governors of both states have eschewed mask requirements, tapping into a spirit of independence hewn from enduring the winters and storms of the Great Plains.

Around the same time, the Maytals signed with Island Records and released the acclaimed album “Funky Kingston,” which the critic Lester Bangs called “the most exciting and diversified set of reggae tunes by a single artist yet released.” (The album would eventually come out in two different versions).

Birmingham won for the first time in 17 games as Sky Bet Championship play-off finalists Brentford’s hangover continued into the new season with a 1-0 defeat at St Andrew’s.
 Jeremie Bela scored the 37th-minute goal that gave Blues their first win since February – and three points for new head coach Aitor Karanka – but they were equally thankful to debutant goalkeeper Zach Jeacock.
 The 19-year-old Brummie – who kept £2million new signing Neil Etheridge on the bench – made a stunning double save in the second half, while Brentford hit the woodwork twice.
 Blues started far better than in last week’s Carabao Cup defeat to Cambridge and created the first chance.
 Bela cut in from the left and rifled in a fierce drive that was superbly tipped around the post by goalkeeper Luke Daniels.
 Brentford were forced into an early substitution after just eight minutes when midfielder Mathias Jensen limped off injured, replaced by Emiliano Marcondes.
 The visitors’ first opening came soon after, however, when £5m striker Ivan Toney unleashed a firm angled drive that flew straight at Jeacock at the near post.
 Brentford wasted an excellent chance when Sergi Canos evaded Maxime Colin’s flying challenge to cut the ball back only for Bryan Mbeumo to scuff his effort straight at Jeacock from close range.
 The Bees went closer when Josh Dasilva’s low drive from the edge of the box bounced off the inside of the post and away.
 Blues hit back and Jon Toral was put in the clear by Lukas Jutkiewicz’s header, but the ball bounced too high as he attempted to volley and Pontus Jansson blocked his attempt.
 The hosts scored when the unmarked Bela ghosted in to head home at the near post from Ivan Sanchez’s corner for his first Sky Bet Championship goal of 2020.
 Blues’ former Brentford connection conjured up a chance which saw them go close to doubling their lead early in the second half.
 Colin produced a brilliant cross and captain Harlee Dean got ahead of his marker to plant a flying header just wide.
 Brentford went desperately close to equalising either side of the hour.
 They hit the woodwork again when Canos’ overhead kick crashed off the underside of the bar and into Jeacock’s arms after the unmarked Ethan Pinnock headed Marcondes’ free-kick across goal.
 They were denied again with Marcondes the guilty party – unmarked for a stooping header palmed away by Jeacock, who foiled him again by blocking the follow-up shot.
 Brentford found a way through when Dasilva released Mbeumo inside Kristian Pedersen, but the forward fired a tight-angled effort across goal and just wide.
 The Bees missed another chance when captain Jansson headed wide from a corner, but Blues held on for a first victory since winning 1-0 at Barnsley on February 11.
