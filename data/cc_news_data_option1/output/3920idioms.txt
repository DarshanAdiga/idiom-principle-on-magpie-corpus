In March 2020, in response to the COVID 19 pandemic, the three agencies had reduced service schedules, suspended fares, limited the number of passengers on board, and required riders to board the bus through the back door (except for passengers needing assistance). They have all resumed regular service schedules. Safety precautions, including enhanced cleaning and disinfecting of buses and physical distancing when possible, will continue. The agencies have also installed safety shields inside buses to help ensure the safety of bus operators and passengers. All riders are required to wear a face covering. Individual agencies may have passenger capacity restrictions and other requirements listed on their websites.

Everton reached their first FA Cup final since 2014 as goals from Simone Magill, Nicoline Sorensen and Valerie Gauvin saw them ease past Birmingham City 3-0 to book their place at Wembley Stadium.
 The Toffees dominated from the off as defender Rikke Sevecke went close in the early stages, rattling the crossbar after a corner caused chaos in the box and eventually led to a let off for Carla Ward’s side.

 Willie Kirk’s team then went close again when Lucy Graham sprinted on to Magill’s pull back only to be thwarted by an inspired Hannah Hampton in the Birmingham goal.
 But Everton finally found a way through moments before half-time when they showed the class that saw them knock out Women’s Super League champions Chelsea in the last round.
 Izzy Christiansen was found on the edge of the area and the ex-Lyon star clipped a wonderful ball into Magill who controlled the ball beautifully before whipping it past Hampton.
 Birmingham showed more ambition at the start of the second half as Claudia Walker went close when her effort was deflected narrowly over the top of Sandy MacIver’s goal.

In a way, Donald Trump has completed his supremacist transformation live. We do not know whether to speak of drift, as racism is constitutive of its political proposal. In 2011, he carved out a reputation for himself among the most right-wing Republicans by espousing the conspiracy theses of the _" Birthers", _claiming that Barack Obama's birth certificate was a fake and therefore could not have stood for the presidential election. When he declared himself a candidate for the Republican primary, in June 2015, the billionaire mobilized the rhetoric of the far-right against Latino immigration _( "They bring drugs. They bring crime. They are rapists."),_ and promises to build a wall along the border with Mexico. _" Donald Trump is the last chance for white America to stay in the White House",_ then analyzed John Mason, professor of political science at William Paterson University.

On April 21, police encountered Williams outside _The (Monroe) News-Star’s_ former office building on North 4th Street in Monroe and asked Williams to stop because they suspected possible drug activity. Police body camera video footage released by the city appeared to show DeSadier kicking Williams in the face while the subject was lying face down on the ground, with his hands behind his back. DeSadier resigned from the force in late July.
 A 52-page filing at Fourth Judicial District Court included two investigative reports by Monroe police detectives based on their probe of the Williams incident on April 21 as well as their interviews with the officers involved.
 The initial police report submitted in April after Williams’ arrest indicated Williams “fell and hit his head on the concrete causing lacerations to his face,” according to Monroe Police Det. James Schmitz. The initial report mentioned nothing about DeSadier’s treatment of Williams as seen in the body cam footage released by the city.
 “Major (Vincent) Guiterrez stated he reviewed body camera footage of the incident and observed Officer DeSadier kick Timothy in the head,” stated Schmitz’s report. “Major Guiterrez stated Officer DeSadier could also be heard in the video beating Timothy.”
 According to Schmitz’s report, a handful of officers questioned each other about whether their body cameras were active at the time of the incident, especially once Williams began to declare the poor treatment he received from DeSadier.
 Body cam footage from Monroe police officer Joshua Rachow, who was placed on administrative leave the same day as DeSadier, indicated Rachow was the officer handcuffing Williams when the suspect was kicked by DeSadier.
 “Officer Rachow is then heard saying, ‘NO,’ as another officer runs into camera view and kicks Timothy in the face/head,” stated Schmitz’s report. “Before the suspect was kicked in the face, he was lying on the ground being quiet. After the kick, the suspect began to cry....After kicking Timothy, it appears Officer DeSadier places his knee next to the suspect’s neck or head. While in a kneeling position, it appears Officer DeSadier knees Timothy in the head.”
 Rachow declined to speak with detectives during their investigation.
 Later, investigators viewing Rachow’s body cam footage reported seeing DeSadier slam Williams on the back of a police car.
 “It should also be noted that just before Officer DeSadier is seen kicking Timothy in the face, the words ‘You hot’ are heard,” stated Schmitz’s report. “Those words are very faint, but it sounds like Officer DeSadier’s voice. The words ‘You hot’ are commonly used with officers to ask each other if you are currently recording.”
 Several police officers responding to the incident on April 21 either possessed body cam footage or gave statements indicating DeSadier repeatedly told Williams he fell on the concrete or deserved what he got whenever the suspect objected to getting his teeth kicked out of his head.
 Of one officer’s body cam footage, investigators reported hearing Williams say, “He knocked my teeth out.”
