Scoperta una molecola in grado di attivare la rigenerazione delle cellule muscolari fino all'età geriatrica. Lo studio, frutto della collaborazione tra la Sapienza e laboratori europei e statunitensi, apre la strada a nuove possibilità terapeutiche anche per i soggetti affetti da patologie neuromuscolari. La ricerca è pubblicata sulla rivista Nature Cell Biology.   Con l’avanzare dell’età i muscoli tendono a perdere parte della massa, e dunque della forza, oltre che la capacità di ripararsi e rigenerarsi in seguito a traumi o danni. Aumenta così nelle persone più anziane il rischio della perdita di autonomia e di una maggiore fragilità.   Un nuovo studio internazionale, coordinato dall’Università Pompeu Fabra di Barcellona con la partecipazione di numerosi laboratori, tra cui quello del gruppo di Antonio Musarò della Sapienza Università di Roma, e pubblicato sulla rivista Nature Cell Biology, ha permesso di individuare il potenziale meccanismo che permetterebbe di mantenere giovani le cellule staminali dei muscoli nei soggetti anziani. Si tratta di un fattore di trascrizione, FoxO, che regola l’espressione genica, quella serie di eventi che traducono le informazioni contenute in un gene e che portano alla formazione di una proteina. Lo studio ha dimostrato che farmaci sperimentali che attivano FoxO possono ringiovanire e rispristinare la funzionalità delle cellule staminali geriatriche, consentendo a un muscolo vecchio di attivare processi rigenerativi che sono tipici di un muscolo giovane.   I risultati dello studio suggeriscono che le cellule staminali dei muscoli non invecchiano tutte allo stesso modo e che ne esiste un sottogruppo che può mantenere la capacità di rigenerarsi anche nei soggetti in età geriatrica. In seguito a un trauma o alle diverse condizioni in cui un muscolo è danneggiato e necessita di un processo riparativo, la rigenerazione del muscolo scheletrico avviene grazie a una popolazione di cellule staminali, le cellule satelliti, che normalmente sono in uno stato di quiescenza. “In età avanzata – spiega Antonio Musarò del Dipartimento di Scienze anatomiche istologiche medico legali e dell’apparato locomotore della Sapienza – in questo sottogruppo di cellule staminali, le cellule satelliti, questo fattore tende a funzionare meno, causando una perdita della capacità rigenerativa di queste cellule”.   La ridotta funzionalità di queste cellule satelliti con l’avanzare dell’età, porta a una diminuzione della capacità del muscolo di riparare un danno o di mantenersi attivo. Fino a oggi i meccanismi, cellulari e molecolari, responsabili di questa disfunzione rigenerativa di un muscolo vecchio non erano stati del tutto chiariti; le conoscenze ora acquisite sul fattore FoxO, seppure attualmente lo studio sia stato condotto solo su modelli animali, aprono la strada a possibili approcci per migliorare la salute delle persone anziane debilitate dalla perdita di massa muscolare o dei pazienti affetti da patologie neuromuscolari.

Control of the Senate can make or break a presidency. With it, a reelected Trump could confirm his nominees and ensure a backstop against legislation from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. Without it, Joe Biden would face a potential wall of opposition to his agenda if the Democratic nominee won the White House.
 In North Carolina, for example, the match-up between GOP Sen. Thom Tillis and Democratic challenger Cal Cunningham, among the most expensive in the nation, is close.
 “At some point, you put it in the hands of voters,” said Dallas Woodhouse, a former executive director of the state's Republican Party.
 Republican incumbents are straining for survival from New England to the Deep South, in the heartland and the West and even Alaska. Overpowered in fundraising and stuck in Washington until just last week to confirm Trump's Supreme Court nominee, they are fanning out some alongside Trump for last- ditch, home-state tours to shore up votes.
 With the chamber now split, 53-47, three or four seats will determine Senate control, depending on which party wins the White House. The vice president breaks a tie in Senate votes.
 What started as a lopsided election cycle with Republicans defending 23 seats, compared with 12 for Democrats, quickly became a more stark referendum on the president as Democrats reached deeper into Trump country and put the GOP on defense.
 Suddenly some of the nation’s better-known senators — Lindsey Graham in South Carolina, Susan Collins in Maine — faced strong reelection threats. Only two Democratic seats are being seriously contested, while at least 10 GOP-held seats are at risk.
 “I don’t see how we hold it,” said Chip Felkel, a Republican strategist in South Carolina who opposes the president.
 Felkel added: “You’d be hard pressed to admit we don’t have a Trump problem.”
 The political landscape is quickly changing from six years ago when most of these senators last faced voters. It's a reminder of how sharp the national mood has shifted in the Trump era.
 Younger voters and more minorities are pushing some states toward Democrats, including in Colorado, where the parties have essentially stopped spending money for or against GOP Sen. Cory Gardner because it seems he is heading toward defeat by Democrat John Hickenlooper, a former governor.
 In more Republican-friendly terrain, the GOP senators must balance an appeal to Trump's most ardent supporters with outreach to voters largely in suburbs who are drifting away from the president and his tone .

 I miss the road.
 I realize that it has only been eight months since the world, as we knew it, stopped turning, but I was supposed to have been to a lot of places in those eight months.
 I can't tell you all of the places because one of them was a mystery to everyone traveling with me, and I am holding out hope that we will still make the trip. But the itinerary encompassed some of the most beautiful areas this great land has to offer. That was just April.
 In May I was supposed to visit the magnificent Greenbrier Resort in West Virginia and enjoy all its amenities -- such as the world-class golf course and the bunker where Congress was supposed to hide when the Soviet Union dropped the Big One. We were going to throw in Thomas Jefferson's home and the Naval Academy, Delaware and the Outer Banks, too, just for good measure.
 And there were summer trips to Scotland and Ireland and another to Germany and Switzerland for the Passion Play that is only held every 10 years. And we were supposed to go to Alaska and New England and Key West and so many other wonderful places that I cannot keep track of them all.
 Like I said, I miss the road. I have been immeasurably blessed to be able to travel over the past seven years to every state in this amazing union several times and to 54 foreign nations. I've seen sights and treasures that I never dreamed I would see outside of a book when I was growing up in Porterdale.
 And I have traveled with some of the most fun-loving and cooperative people on the planet -- and, let's face it -- one or two old grumps. And I have a million memories that will warm my heart for as long as I live.
 I found that I couldn't sleep Wednesday night -- I suppose it was technically Thursday morning -- so I got up and sat in the dark on my back porch, watching the rain fall and listening to the tropical winds howl -- yes, we got tropical winds in Bishop on Thursday morning -- and reflected on the places I had been and the people I had met and the precious memories I had made.
 I told myself that I should just be happy to have had the opportunities, and I am. But I still miss the road.
 And this week I miss the Georgia coast. Georgia-Florida week has been one of the highlights of my year for a long time. But not this year. Not in 2020.
 My trip to Jacksonville has evolved over the years from quick dashes south of the Florida state line with my buddies -- there were years we went down and back on the same day -- to short weekends with just my lovely wife, Lisa, and I, to weeklong vacations where Lisa and I would go down early and serve as the advance team while our children arrived, one by one or two by two, as the week progressed.
 And after experimenting with locales as diverse as Amelia Island, St. Augustine and the Jacksonville Landing, we finally settled in on the Golden Isles, choosing to spend our money in the great state of Georgia. Sometimes we would stay on St. Simons, amidst the madness that is -- or was -- Frat Beach. Sometimes we stayed on the more serene Jekyll Island. When we stayed on Jekyll, we made several trips around to St. Simons because nobody should ever go to the Georgia coast without enjoying some barbecue at Southern Soul or some fresh fried Georgia shrimp at the Crab Trap.
 And there were always plenty of stories to share and new avenues to explore. And, of course, game day and epic tailgates and memorable games. I started attending Georgia-Florida in the '60s when Vince Dooley owned the Gators. We would show up in Jacksonville expecting to win and were rarely disappointed. Then things changed and Saturdays along the banks of the St. Johns River were not quite as enjoyable.
 Finally, however, the pendulum began to swing back the other way and we have grown accustomed to going home happy, just like the Dooley days.
 But this year I will watch Georgia-Florida from the confines of my basement bunker, a week later than normal. I miss the road.
 I am going to be a rebel, however. I will watch alone from my basement, but I am not going to wear a mask. So, chomp that!

“It is increasingly clear that the collection of adequate supplies of plasma is not possible; the answer being the adoption of new process technology that fully utilizes the scarce plasma currently available,” he said.
 But whether Zurlo’s technology, which claims to increase the amount of disease-fighting plasma harvested from human blood, will be an improvement over other methods is still anyone’s guess.

 A FORMER SENATOR ON BOARD
 Top government officials began to take notice of Plasma Technologies after Rick Santorum, a former Republican senator from Pennsylvania and two-time presidential candidate, became part-owner, according to the records and AP interviews.
 After Congress supplied hundreds of billions of dollars to combat the pandemic, Santorum stepped up his sales pitch for the company’s method of turning human plasma into a therapeutic product — a process the company has described as a game changer. In mid-August, the federal government awarded Plasma Technologies a $750,000 grant to demonstrate that it could deliver on its promises.
 Santorum, who’s held no elective office since 2007, remains influential among social conservatives, a key part of President Donald Trump’s political base. Santorum has extolled the president’s handling of the pandemic on national television in his job as a CNN commentator, arguing that the nation’s response would have been worse under a Democratic administration.
 Trump "didn’t botch it,” Santorum said recently in response to charges that the president had done a poor job leading the country through COVID-19. “I mean you guys keep blaming Trump. This is a local decision.”

Bloomberg) -- Democrats are on the brink of capturing the Senate to give the party full control of Congress, though the final outcome depends heavily on the strength of presidential nominee Joe Biden’s performance in Tuesday’s election.
 Polls and independent analysts indicate Democrats have a solid chance at winning at least a narrow Senate majority, with Republicans on the defensive in 12 of the 14 most competitive races. And two years after Democrats gained control of the House by winning 41 GOP-held districts they are looking to add a dozen or more in 2020.
 For both parties, the Senate largely hinges on the presidential contest between Biden and President Donald Trump.
 Biden has healthy poll leads in two states with vulnerable GOP incumbents on the ballot -- Maine and Colorado. He and Trump are essentially deadlocked in several other states with competitive Senate races, including Arizona, Iowa and North Carolina. At the same time, Trump is under-performing in many of the other states he won in 2016, giving Democrats opportunities in traditionally Republican strongholds such as Georgia and South Carolina.
 “The top of the ballot is critical,” said Nathan Gonzales, editor and publisher of the nonpartisan Inside Elections. “Four years ago the presidential results and the Senate results matched up in every single state. That demonstrates a small appetite for ticket-splitting.”
 Republicans now have a 53-47 Senate majority. If Republicans flip the Alabama Senate seat held by Democrat Doug Jones, Democrats would have to pick up at least four GOP seats to control the Senate if Biden wins. Democrats would need to win at least five seats to have the majority if Trump wins re-election, since the vice president can cast a tie-breaking vote in the 100-member body.
 With the House likely to remain firmly in Democratic control, the eventual margin in the Senate will be key to whether Congress will again be gridlocked.
 The biggest targets for Democrats are GOP Senators Susan Collins of Maine, Cory Gardner of Colorado of Martha McSally in Arizona, all of whom have trailed their challengers consistently in public polls and fundraising. Collins and Gardner are the only two Republican incumbents in states won by Hillary Clinton in 2016. McSally lost in 2018 to Kyrsten Sinema before she was appointed to the seat once held by John McCain.
 Collins’ support among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, who long have helped her comfortably win re-election in the past, evaporated after her votes for the 2017 GOP tax overhaul, to confirm Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and to acquit Trump after his impeachment trial.
 Although Collins has tried to distance herself from Trump, refusing to say whether she’ll vote for him on Nov. 3 and opposing the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett, her Democratic challenger, Maine House Speaker Sara Gideon, has accused her of putting Trump’s priorities over Maine’s.
 Gardner went from leading his party’s Senate campaign committee in 2018 to becoming one of its most-endangered senators, trailing former two-term Democratic Governor John Hickenlooper. Gardner has questioned Hickenlooper on ethics and energy policy, but his embrace of Trump opened him up to Democratic attacks. Republicans are now spending little to try to keep the seat.
 McSally’s seat is in formerly reliable territory for a Republican, but demographic shifts, a Trump backlash and the changing politics of health care have her on the defensive. McSally is up against one of the Democrats’ best- funded challengers, astronaut Mark Kelly, who has pledged to be an independent voice for Arizona.
 Republicans will likely need to hold on in North Carolina and Iowa to keep the Senate, analysts said.
 “North Carolina or Iowa could be the tipping-point states,” said Jessica Taylor, Senate editor of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report.
 Senate campaigns and outside groups in North Carolina have spent more than $250 million on the race between incumbent Republican Thom Tillis and Democratic challenger Cal Cunningham, according to Advertising Analytics.
 Cunningham saw his advantage slip after a scandal broke involving racy texts he sent to a woman who was not his wife. Tillis has said this means Cunningham is untrustworthy, while Cunningham has said what voters really care about is the future of Obamacare, not his personal life. Polls have tightened but Cunningham has clung to a narrow lead in the RealClear Politics average.
 Dead Heat
 Iowa Senator Joni Ernst, who has tied herself closely to Trump and is a member of the GOP’s Senate leadership, is in a dead heat with Democratic challenger Theresa Greenfield. Greenfield has out-raised Ernst in recent quarters, and is the main beneficiary of the $150 million spent by outside groups in the race. Trump won the state by 9 points in 2016, but he and Biden are running neck-in- neck.
 In Montana, Republican Steve Daines has a 3-point lead over Democratic Governor Steve Bullock, according to recent polling averages that also show Trump consistently ahead of Biden in the state. Like other Democratic challengers, Bullock has out-raised Daines, raking in $38.7 million to Daines’s $26.1 million. In a reflection of the race’s importance, the Senate Leadership Fund, a super political action committee run by allies of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, has spent $22 million in the race to help Daines. The rival Senate Majority Fund, run by associates of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has spent $15 million to influence the outcome.
 The Swing South
 South Carolina’s Lindsey Graham, the Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, faces a strong challenge from Democrat Jaime Harrison. Most recent polls showed them tied, although an Oct. 9-15 New York Times/Siena poll had Graham with a 46%-40% lead. South Carolina hasn’t elected a new Democratic senator since 1966, but Graham faces a backlash for turning from Trump critic to close ally. Harrison broke fundraising records, bringing in $57 million in the third quarter.
 Georgia has two Senate races this year, both of them close enough that they could go to a runoff, potentially leaving control of the chamber in doubt until January. In one race, most polls show Republican incumbent David Perdue in a tie with Democratic challenger Jon Ossoff, who narrowly lost an Atlanta- area House special election in 2017. The race includes Libertarian Shane Hazel.
 In the other contest, gubernatorally appointed Kelly Loeffler is one of 20 candidates in the special election for her seat, including GOP Representative Doug Collins, who claims to be the true conservative standard-bearer. The leading Democrat in the race is Raphael Warnock, senior pastor of the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta.
 There are several other wild card races that could swing to Democrats if everything goes their way on Election Day, including Alaska, Texas and Kansas.
 There is one bright spot for Republicans: in Alabama, where it’s highly likely that Republican challenger Tommy Tuberville will defeat incumbent Democrat Jones.
 The GOP’s only other pickup opportunity is in Michigan, where incumbent Democratic Senator Gary Peters is leading GOP challenger John James by 7.6 points in an average of recent polls by RealClearPolitics. Still, Republicans haven’t given up on the race and both parties are fighting it out to the end, Taylor said.
 “Both sides are putting a lot of money in Michigan,” Taylor said. “A lot of it is from Republicans trying to find another place to force Democrats to play defense.”

ISLAMABAD, (APP - UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 1st Nov, 2020 ) :Pakistan won the three-match One Day series by 2-0, when they outplayed Zimbabwe by six wickets in the second ODI at the Pindi Stadium, Rawalpindi on Sunday.
 The match was finished in style by Skipper Babar Azam by hitting a six in the 35.2 over. The prolific batsman remained not out on 77 runs and hit seven 4s and two 6s.
 For Pakistan, Abid Ali was the first to go to the pavilion for 22 runs including four 4s. He was taken by Ervine in Tendai Chisoro's over. Pakistan reached half century in 8.4 overs while made 100 in 15.5 overs.
 Imam went unlucky as he was caught behind on 49 runs in Tendai Chisoro's over. He played 61 balls and hit five 4s. Haider Ali who received the debut cap from Skipper Babar Azam hit the first six of the game in the 20.4 over. He tried to play a sweep shot in the 21.6 over of Sea Williams and was deemed lbw by umpire but review was been taken which also showed that no bat or gloves were involved and ball hit the middle. Mohammad Rizwan was bold by Sikandad Raza in the 26.1 over when he tried to play a reverse sweep, but missed and the ball touched the stumps on the way through to keeper.
 On the day, Zimbabwe elected to bat after winning the toss and were restricted to a total of 206 runs in the 45.1 overs by the Pakistani bowlers. Ifthikhar Ahmed was the pick of the bowlers as he bagged five wickets for 40 runs. His big wicket was of Brendan Taylor (36) who was the man of the match in the first ODI for his amazing knock in the game.

LEXINGTON, Ky. -- UGA football put up its fewest points in a game against Kentucky in 25 years yet coach Kirby Smart didn't bite when asked if he felt his team is limited offensively.

I see them pass pro. I see them throw and catch the ball. I see them run. I see us play-action. I see good things out of our offense."

 "I thought the guys came out here and played really hard and played really physical. I just have to fix the things I messed up on," Bennett said.
   
 Georgia's defense lost four starters Saturday to injury and a fifth, safety Richard LeCounte, was involved in a vehicle incident after returning to Athens after the game.
   
 Trask threw for 345 yards and four touchdowns Saturday night in a 41-17 win over Missouri.
   
 Smart continued to give every indication that Bennett will remain the starter. That seemed obvious given he stuck with Bennett after two more interceptions Saturday to give him five in the last two games, matching the number Jake Fromm had all of last season in 14 games.
   
 "There was no discussion about it," Smart said. "A batted ball on a pass that he's got to get around a guy is not a real struggle. I know you could say, 'if it happens once, shame on me. If it happens twice, shame on you,' but it's one of those things where he's got to wrap the ball around it, he's got to throw it away, he's got to get another opportunity."
   
 Bennett's two worst games in pass efficiency have come in the last two. Smart isn't judging Bennett on metrics like that but instead on things such as his second rushing touchdown of the season Saturday.
   
 "He also did a lot of good things in the run game," Smart said. "He pulled a ball and scored with it. He put us in the right run plays. He handled motion. He handled clock. He did some good things. He didn't get a chance to throw the ball an awful lot (Saturday) because we were able to run the ball."
   
 Smart and offensive coordinator Todd Monken haven't turned again to redshirt freshman D'Wan Mathis, the starter against Arkansas, or Southern Cal transfer JT Daniels, who has yet to play this season after a torn ACL last year.
   
 Making a quarterback change for Florida blew up on Georgia in 2015 and contributed to Smart ending up as Bulldogs head coach. The SEC Network broadcast crew said repeatedly Saturday that the impression they got after talking to Smart and Monken is that this is Bennett's team.
   
 Smart credited Bennett for his management of the offense -- handling shifts, motions and checks on a day Bennett said there were a lot of checks into run plays -- and Smart said Bennett really had just one "poor decision" when he didn't check down instead of throwing a pass he tried to toss out of bounds but didn't get it far enough.
   
 "I'm not going to overreact to one poor decision," Smart said. "It would be making those multiple times that gets concerning. At the end of the day we've got to play the guy that gives us the best chance to win."
   
 Georgia rushed for 215 yards Saturday, but even in a game where Zamir White had a career-best 136 rushing yards, the longest run of the day for the Bulldogs was his 22-yard touchdown.
   
 The Bulldogs have just one run of 30 or more yards this season.
   
 "We all know that in order to be the kind of team we want to be, the explosive team, we have to be able to run the ball for longer-yardage runs and we also have to be able to throw the ball effectively," Smart said. "We unfortunately didn't get much of a chance to do that today. Monken threw a couple of shots and he made a couple of plays with them."
   
 Smart wants more like the 46-yard pass play to James Cook and 33-yard catch by Darnell Washington.
   
 The Bulldogs 6.1 yards per play were still a season high. But the problem was the 57 plays run were the fewest for Georgia since -- you guessed it -- 55 against Kentucky last season.
   
 That was partly on the defense which had trouble getting the Wildcats off the field.
   
 Kentucky limited the ability of the Georgia defenses to make momentum changing plays by keeping it on the ground for much of the game.
   
 "If you watch them this year when -- they can overwhelm you and obviously turn the game or blow the game wide open with their defense with strip sacks, with interceptions for touchdowns, just creating havoc with their defense in predictable situations," said Kentucky coach Mark Stoops.
   
 Kentucky's 3.54 yards per rush was the highest against Georgia this season, just ahead of Alabama's 3.42.
   
 "I thought we were creative with keeping a really, really talented defense on their heels as far as some of the run game," Stoops said.
   
 "Definitely could have tackled better, a lot of things we could have done better as a defense," LeCounte said. "We've got to get back to the drawing board, because we're far from perfect. We have to fix some things and do better tackling."
   
 Georgia managed its fewest points against Kentucky since a 12-3 win in 1995 when Smart was a sophomore.
   
 The Bulldogs were missing two of their playmakers on offense Saturday in wide receiver George Pickens (undisclosed injury) and running back Kenny McIntosh (knee) who didn't make the trip but Smart said practiced last week.
   
 "They weren't well enough to be effective and play so we went with other guys," he said. "We wanted them to go. They wanted to go, they've worked really hard. They've spent a lot of time getting ready, and hopefully we get them back this week."
   
 Georgia could certainly use nose guard Jordan Davis, who had his arm in a sling after leaving the game, and defensive lineman Julian Rochester, who also left the game injured. He's started the last two games.
   
 Starting safety Lewis Cine, inside linebacker Quay Walker and cornerback Dominique Stevenson also exited injured.
   
 The losses on the defensive line forced Nazir Stackhouse, who was practicing on the scout team, to step in along with fellow freshman Warren Brinson while Christopher Smith again got the call at safety.
   
 "I don't know if all those guys were ready for that kind of physicality," Smart said, "but they better get ready because they're playing in the SEC the rest of the way."

MILAN (AP) — Zlatan Ibrahimović set up one and scored the winner to help Serie A leader AC Milan win 2-1 at lowly Udinese on Sunday.
 Ibrahimović continued to roll back the years with an overhead kick seven minutes from time after a Rodrigo De Paul penalty canceled out Franck Kessié’s opener.
 The 39-year-old Ibrahimović, who recently recovered from the coronavirus, has now scored seven goals in his past four league matches.
 Milan is now unbeaten in 23 matches in all competitions and moved four points clear of second-place Atalanta. Napoli or Sassuolo can close the gap to two points if either win in their head-to-head meeting later.
 Juventus will move to within four points of Milan if the nine-time defending champion wins at newly promoted Spezia later. Cristiano Ronaldo should feature after recovering from the coronavirus.
 In Udine, Milan took the lead in the 18th minute with a fantastic team move. Ismaël Bennacer sent a long ball over the top that Ibrahimović chested down and held up before laying it off to Kessié, who blasted it into the top right corner.

Bloomberg) -- Details provided by a restructuring firm to Mike Ashley’s Frasers Group about the embattled retailer Debenhams is “woefully inadequate,” attorneys representing the prospective buyer said, according to the Sunday Times. Frasers, in a letter to investment bank Lazard, said there had been a “deliberate attempt to exclude us from the process.”
 Debenhams, which employs about 12,000 people, has been struggling with the shift in U.K. retail habits for years, well before the coronavirus pandemic forced shops to close. Last year creditors took control of the chain and in April it entered administration to protect the company from the threat of legal action while its 142 U.K. stores were closed.
 In June and July, the company reopened almost 90% of its stores and administrators started seeking a sale to a third party or joint venture.
 Debenhams told the Times it was conducting a “fair and thorough process.” Lazard declined to comment to the Times. Freshfields, a law firm also involved in the process, didn’t respond to a request for comment from the Times.

Hyundai India is confident of sustaining the strong momentum in the coming months, thanks to the soon-to-be-launched new i20 The festive season rush, rise in customer preference for private transport and the pent up demand due to inactivity in the prior months have given Hyundai India a significant boost in its October 2020 sales performance. In fact, the country's second largest automaker registered its highest ever domestic monthly sales last month! Hyundai's excellent recovery from the ongoing crisis is in line with the general trend in the Indian automotive market for October 2020. Hyundai India October 2020 sales The South Korean automaker registered a domestic sales performance of 56,605 units last month as against previous October's tally of 50,010 units at a YoY growth of 13.2%. This performance bettered the company's previous record monthly sales of 52,001 units which came in October 2018. While we wait for the product-wise sales-split, we expect the New Creta to have driven the record sales. The mid-premium crossover has been topping the SUV sales chart for the last few months. Hyundai also offered significant discounts on its other products including benefits of up to INR 75,000 off certain variants of Elite i20 in a bid to deplete inventory. The all-new Hyundai i20 is scheduled to be launched on November 5. Hyundai India exports Hyundai India has been the country's leading exporter for cars since its inception and it continued its status quo last month by shipping 12,230 units. The cumulative sales stood at 68,835 units. The pandemic-driven logistical problems and slowdown in destination markets have resulted in a degrowth in export of 10.1% compared to October 2019. Export operations are expected to continue experiencing some pressure in the coming as well as various countries are struggling with the second wave of COVID-19. New Hyundai i20 and its outlook The Hyundai i20 which has been one of the best selling cars in the country for a long time is all set to graduate to a new generation later this week. With a complete design overhaul inside out, modern features and a new engine, the premium hatchback is poised to give its rivals a proper run for their money, boosting Hyundai India's already strong sales momentum in the process. Bookings for the new i20 have already commenced in full swing across the country and if the nameplate's brand recall is anything to go by, we expect it to be already sitting on over 10,000 bookings on its launch day. The car will rival the ageing segment leader Maruti Baleno in addition to Tata Altroz which has been gaining popularity steadily, Honda Jazz, and the obsolete yet enthusiast's favourite, VW Polo.

WASHINGTON (AP) — When the Trump administration gave a well-connected Republican donor seed money to test a possible COVID-19-fighting blood plasma technology, it noted the company’s “manufacturing facilities” in Charleston, South Carolina.
 Plasma Technologies LLC is indeed based in the stately waterfront city. But there are no manufacturing facilities. Instead, the company exists within the luxury condo of its majority owner, Eugene Zurlo.
 Zurlo's company may be in line for as much as $65 million in taxpayer dollars; enough to start building an actual production plant, according to internal government records and other documents obtained by The Associated Press.
 The story of how a tiny business that exists only on paper has managed to snare attention from the highest reaches of the U.S. military and government is emblematic of the Trump administration’s frenetic response to the coronavirus pandemic.
 It's also another in a series of contracts awarded to people with close political ties to key officials despite concerns voiced by government scientists. Among the others: an ill-conceived $21 million study of Pepcid as a COVID therapy and more than a half billion dollars to ApiJect Systems America, a startup with an unapproved medicine injection technology and no factory to manufacture the devices.
 In addition, a government whistleblower claimed that a $1.6 billion vaccine contract to Novavax Inc. was made over objections of scientific staff.

It will come as no surprise to learn that the analysts have increased their price target for Deckers Outdoor 14% to US$298on the back of these upgrades. Fixating on a single price target can be unwise though, since the consensus target is effectively the average of analyst price targets. As a result, some investors like to look at the range of estimates to see if there are any diverging opinions on the company's valuation. The most optimistic Deckers Outdoor analyst has a price target of US$310 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$240. Still, with such a tight range of estimates, it suggeststhe analysts have a pretty good idea of what they think the company is worth.

Santorum told the group about his youngest child, who was born with a life-threatening condition known as Trisomy 18, according to a transcript. Immunoglobulin treatments had saved her life, he told the audience.
 Santorum’s personal story about his child’s illness was intertwined with a promotion of Plasma Technologies. Santorum said Zurlo, whom he called “a good friend,” had invented a groundbreaking technology for better plasma-based therapies to help his child and others.
 Santorum credited Marks, director of FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, for pledging to remove barriers that have kept Plasma Technologies on the outside, looking in. “All I’m saying is, we have an opportunity because of Dr. Marks and what he has laid forward,” Santorum said at the workshop.
 The former senator told the AP it would have been a “crime” if he hadn’t used his influence to get Plasma Technologies recognized.
 “Shame on me if I hadn’t,” he said.

 In mid-April, a few weeks after Trump declared the coronavirus pandemic a national emergency, Santorum described Marks as an enthusiastic backer of Plasma Technologies, according to an email routed to multiple officials in the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, an HHS office Kadlec oversees.
 Calling himself a “small shareholder” in Plasma Technologies, Santorum wrote, “Dr. Marks said I should communicate to you that he is ‘excited about this process and looks forward to working with us to get our process adopted by the industry.’”

WASHINGTON (AP) — Senate Republicans are fighting to save their majority, a final election push against the onslaught of challengers in states once off limits to Democrats but now hotbeds of a potential backlash to President Donald Trump and his allies on Capitol Hill.
 Fueling the campaigns are the Trump administration’s handling of the COVID-19 crisis, shifting regional demographics and, in some areas, simply the chance to turn the page on the divisive political climate.
 Control of the Senate can make or break a presidency. With it, a reelected Trump could confirm his nominees and ensure a backstop against legislation from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. Without it, Joe Biden would face a potential wall of opposition to his agenda if the Democratic nominee won the White House.
 In North Carolina, for example, the match-up between GOP Sen. Thom Tillis and Democratic challenger Cal Cunningham, among the most expensive in the nation, is close.
 “At some point, you put it in the hands of voters,” said Dallas Woodhouse, a former executive director of the state's Republican Party.
 Republican incumbents are straining for survival from New England to the Deep South, in the heartland and the West and even Alaska. Overpowered in fundraising and stuck in Washington until just last week to confirm Trump's Supreme Court nominee, they are fanning out some alongside Trump for last- ditch, home-state tours to shore up votes.

This is the third straight year of duplicate dubious September-October beginnings.
 The Broncos couldn’t recover to finish above .500 in 1961 (3-11), '63 (3-11), ’68 (2-11-1), ’72 (5-9), ’90 (5-11 with John Elway at quarterback), '99 (6-10), ’18 (6-10) and ’19 (7-9). The other, though, was 8-8.
 Don’t let it ever be forgot, for one bright, shining moment in this spot we love as if it were Camelot, the Broncos rallied from 2-4 not only to reach the improbable dream of the playoffs, but also to be crowned AFC West champions.
 In Season 2011, Elway’s first as King Arthur of Broncos football operations, the team staggered to a 1-4 record, but there was a sign of hope and faith when, yes, the Chargers departed Denver. Tim Tebow took over from Kyle Orton in the second half and led the Broncos to a near-miraculous comeback before they fell slightly short and silent at the conclusion.
 In a mystery that remains to this day, either John Elway or new coach John Fox boldly made Tebow the starting quarterback for the next game in Miami. Each of the Johns told me, separately, then that he made the decision.
 Against the Dolphins, back when 63,800 could fill the stadium (and the majority cheered for University of Florida savior Tebow), young Timmy brought the Broncos back from a 15-0 deficit in the fourth quarter to a tie, and a Miami fumble in overtime preceded the Broncos’ winning field goal.
 After being blown out by the Lions the following Sunday at home, the Broncos would streak to six consecutive victories with the league’s most provocative player – Tebow, who eventually produced six comeback drives in fourth quarters and overtimes, including one against the Chargers in the rematch and the last on the opening play of the extra period against the Steelers in a playoff game. Tebow was Lightning in the Rockies.
 Tebow was succeeded by Peyton Manning, who succeeded until retiring. The Broncos haven’t succeeded since.
 Will they now?
 In 2011, the Broncos had missed the playoffs for five seasons in a row. In 2020 the Broncos have been without playoffs for four seasons.
 The Chargers are back in town 10 years later.

The county health department does list 247 coronavirus-positive people who visited K-12 campuses countywide from June 5 through Oct. 24, but that count is incomplete because it relies on information shared during contact-tracing interviews.
 Those 247 cases represent 0.7 percent of all COVID-19 cases in the county for which interviews were completed. That’s lower than the 30 percent of cases potentially linked to workplaces and the 9 percent of cases potentially linked to bars and restaurants, according to county health data.
 Dr. Eric McDonald, medical director of the county’s epidemiology department, said his department has been unable to reach and interview about 13 percent of those who test positive, meaning there are likely some kids who tested positive who are not included in the campus exposure count.
 Plans are in the works, he said, to cobble together a complete picture, but there are 42 school districts in the county and each may communicate their data differently.

Srikakulam district will be free from COVID-19 soon because of increased awareness among people in the rural areas, according to a study conducted by R. Aravind, former in-charge of COVID wing of Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS).
 According to him, people in the rural areas are taking all precautions like maintaining social distancing and wearing masks although there are no positive cases in their villages.
 “Earlier, the district used to register over 400 cases per day, but now its number has come down to below 100. Only 95 cases were registered on Sunday. It’s a good sign,” said Dr. Aravind while speaking to _The Hindu_. Along with Head of Obstetrics and Gynaecology I. Vani, Dr. Aravind ensured safe delivery of nearly 150 women who were infected by coronavirus. He gathered information from the women and their relatives over the awareness of COVID-19 in the rural areas of Tekkali, Santabommali, Kotabommali and other places.
 He personally visited some villages of Tekkali mandal to take stock of the situation at ground level. “Towns such as Srikakulam, Tekkali and Palasa are generally crowded. So infection may spread in towns more compared to villages where density of population is less. No crowds are seen in public places in villages. It is one of the reasons for drop in positive cases such areas, ” he added.
 Dr. Aravind, who earlier conducted a detailed study on kidney patients of the Uddanam region, said patients with multiple previous health problems need to be careful about COVID-19. “Many patients with comorbidity died in spite of the best efforts of doctors in RIMS and other hospitals. So special care will have to be taken in spite of drop in new positive cases in the district,” he observed.
 ## Total number of tests
 Meanwhile, the district administration conducted COVID-19 test for 9,343 persons on Sunday, taking the total number of tests to 5,71,648 in the district. As many as 44,322 positive cases were reported in the district. Currently, the district has 936 positive cases.

Click. Yes, she hung up on me.
 I’ve watched her performance since she took office in 2019. I am underwhelmed.
 It’s nonsense for Griswold and her supporters to complain she’s being criticized because she’s a woman. She is under fire for some of the same reasons one of her predecessors, Republican Scott Gessler, took heat. Ego. Arrogance. And a failure to work well with the people who run elections — Colorado’s 64 county clerks.
 Chaffee County Clerk Lori Mitchell, a Democrat, told the Colorado Sun, “I am the same party as she is, but you’ve got to call them like you see them. I feel like she’s gotten away with some things because people don’t want to look like they are attacking a young woman.”
 Over the years, I’ve read unflattering stories about Colorado women in office — Secretary of State Natalie Meyer, lawmaker Norma Anderson, Lt. Gov. Gail Schoettler, House Speaker Crisanta Duran and, of course, myself. Griswold would be well-advised to follow the advice of politician and showman P.T. Barnum, “I don’t care what you say about me as long as you spell my name right.”
 It’s not cool to play the gender card. Whining is bad for women, perpetuating the I-am-victim trope and undermining our smarts, competence and appetite for competition.
 Listen to the thorough investigation into Secretary Griswold’s office by Colorado Public Radio’s Ben Markus. Griswold pledged transparency when she ran for secretary of state. So why did she want to charge CPR more than $5,000 for documents available from previous administrations for a nominal fee under Colorado’s Open Records Act? Is it because those documents reveal the turmoil and turnover since Griswold took office?
 In a highly unusual move, her former deputy, Jenny Flanagan, signed a nondisclosure agreement when she left the secretary’s office. If asked about her experience, Flanagan was instructed to say, “It’s been an honor to work with the secretary and the terrific team at the department.”
 Candor? Transparency? Ummmm, not so much.
 Clearly, Griswold dances with the truth. Recently, she claimed she invited La Plata County Clerk Tiffany Parker to a meeting with the Southern Ute Indian Tribe, which is the customary thing to do when a state executive travels on business. Parker, whose county includes the Ute reservations, said she knew nothing about Griswold’s visit.
 The Broomfield clerk and recorder and her deputy recently came under fire for their unflattering remarks about Griswold in emails to each other. City Manager Jennifer Hoffman was concerned and in a recorded meeting with the pair, talked about the impact if the emails became public.
 “The closer to the election they start jacking around with ‘the unprofessional political neophyte that Jena Griswold is,’ the worse it makes it for the state of Colorado,” Hoffman said.
 Unprofessional political neophyte. Well, Jena Griswold is lucky she wasn’t called a “harridan,” which is how former Denver Post editorial page writer Bob Ewegen once referred to me. A harridan is a scolding, vicious woman, a hag or a shrew.
 Politics is not for the faint of heart. Griswold is smart, educated, talented and ambitious. She ought to get out of her own way and enjoy the ride.

--DocBreak--
I miss the road.
   
 I realize that it has only been eight months since the world, as we knew it, stopped turning, but I was supposed to have been to a lot of places in those eight months.
   
 I can't tell you all of the places because one of them was a mystery to everyone traveling with me, and I am holding out hope that we will still make the trip. But the itinerary encompassed some of the most beautiful areas this great land has to offer. That was just April.
   
 In May I was supposed to visit the magnificent Greenbrier Resort in West Virginia and enjoy all its amenities -- such as the world-class golf course and the bunker where Congress was supposed to hide when the Soviet Union dropped the Big One. We were going to throw in Thomas Jefferson's home and the Naval Academy, Delaware and the Outer Banks, too, just for good measure.
   
 And there were summer trips to Scotland and Ireland and another to Germany and Switzerland for the Passion Play that is only held every 10 years. And we were supposed to go to Alaska and New England and Key West and so many other wonderful places that I cannot keep track of them all.
   
 Like I said, I miss the road. I have been immeasurably blessed to be able to travel over the past seven years to every state in this amazing union several times and to 54 foreign nations. I've seen sights and treasures that I never dreamed I would see outside of a book when I was growing up in Porterdale.
   
 And I have traveled with some of the most fun-loving and cooperative people on the planet -- and, let's face it -- one or two old grumps. And I have a million memories that will warm my heart for as long as I live.
   
 I found that I couldn't sleep Wednesday night -- I suppose it was technically Thursday morning -- so I got up and sat in the dark on my back porch, watching the rain fall and listening to the tropical winds howl -- yes, we got tropical winds in Bishop on Thursday morning -- and reflected on the places I had been and the people I had met and the precious memories I had made.
   
 I told myself that I should just be happy to have had the opportunities, and I am. But I still miss the road.
   
 And this week I miss the Georgia coast. Georgia-Florida week has been one of the highlights of my year for a long time. But not this year. Not in 2020.
   
 My trip to Jacksonville has evolved over the years from quick dashes south of the Florida state line with my buddies -- there were years we went down and back on the same day -- to short weekends with just my lovely wife, Lisa, and I, to weeklong vacations where Lisa and I would go down early and serve as the advance team while our children arrived, one by one or two by two, as the week progressed.
   
 And after experimenting with locales as diverse as Amelia Island, St. Augustine and the Jacksonville Landing, we finally settled in on the Golden Isles, choosing to spend our money in the great state of Georgia. Sometimes we would stay on St. Simons, amidst the madness that is -- or was -- Frat Beach. Sometimes we stayed on the more serene Jekyll Island. When we stayed on Jekyll, we made several trips around to St. Simons because nobody should ever go to the Georgia coast without enjoying some barbecue at Southern Soul or some fresh fried Georgia shrimp at the Crab Trap.
   
 And there were always plenty of stories to share and new avenues to explore. And, of course, game day and epic tailgates and memorable games. I started attending Georgia-Florida in the '60s when Vince Dooley owned the Gators. We would show up in Jacksonville expecting to win and were rarely disappointed. Then things changed and Saturdays along the banks of the St. Johns River were not quite as enjoyable.
   
 Finally, however, the pendulum began to swing back the other way and we have grown accustomed to going home happy, just like the Dooley days.
   
 But this year I will watch Georgia-Florida from the confines of my basement bunker, a week later than normal. I miss the road.
   
 I am going to be a rebel, however. I will watch alone from my basement, but I am not going to wear a mask. So, chomp that!

Donny van de Beek did not play much in recent weeks, with Solskjaer often choosing to keep him on the bench, but tonight he used him very well. The Dutchman played at the top of a midfield diamond, behind two strikers, ultimately getting a lot of freedom to move both laterally and vertically. That is because going backwards he was always of use to Matic, Fred and Pogba and moving left and right ahead of them allowed him to find pockets where he was able to be dangerous and create for others. A good showing for the new signing.

Regardless, partisans on both sides believe no less than the future of the country is at stake.
 That Trump is responsible for such a high-level of public engagement in the election is ironic, to say the least. Such activism should be good for democracy, but the president at almost every turn has sought to cast doubt on the legitimacy of the democratic process in this election.
 He has claimed without proof that the widespread use of mail ballots during the coronavirus pandemic will result in massive voter fraud. Trump and his allies have waged legal and procedural battles seeking to limit who can vote and how, and to halt vote counts before all legally valid ballots are tabulated.
 Citing all that and more, Trump’s critics say he is pushing the United States toward autocracy, not democracy. The ultimate judgment of his impact on that may depend on whether or not his challenges of voting systems succeed.

Longview Mayor Andy Mack is continuing to follow the governor’s pandemic- inspired order pertaining to outdoor events, despite requests from the community for him to loosen restrictions.
 According to Gov. Greg Abbott’s executive order, outdoor gatherings of more than 10 people are prohibited unless approved by the mayor of the city in which the gathering is held or the county judge in the case of a gathering in an unincorporated area. Indoor gatherings must abide by capacity guidelines based on the type of business. For example, restaurants can operate at 75% capacity.
 “It’s really simple. We’re following the governor’s orders as best we can to the letter of his order,” Mack said this past week.
 Earlier this month, Longview arts organizations collectively came together to send a letter to Mack asking him to loosen restrictions on outdoor events so they could hold events that would help sustain them financially through the pandemic. Mack said he denied their request and added that he has denied all requests that have come to him.
 Cynthia Hellen, executive director for the Arts!Longview Cultural District, said the pandemic has caused a financial strain to local arts organizations. With indoor capacity and social distancing restrictions in place, many organizations have pivoted to virtual events and have struggled to even “break even” with the cost of performances, she said.
 “This has created a real financial threat to the arts,” Hellen said. “Almost every arts organization is feeling that really strongly right now.”
 In a discussion earlier this year, local arts organizations suggested that outdoor events in which there was more space for people to social distance might allow them to recoup some lost funding, Hellen said.
 “We thought maybe we could use a stage at one of the parks or have an event outside downtown,” she said. “We wanted to see what we could find out. We decided to go through the proper channels to see if we could get approval. So, we wrote a letter to the mayor and asked him to consider that.”
 Hellen’s name is one of nine that appears on the letter sent Oct. 13 to Mack. Others are Michelle Norris, executive director of ArtsView Children’s Theatre; Holly Forbes, chair of ArtWalk; Michelle Holyfield of the East Texas Symphonic Band; Lindsay Loy, executive director of the Gregg County Historical Museum; Courtney Armstrong, executive director of Longview Ballet; Tiffany Nolan Jehorek, executive director of Longview Museum of Fine Arts; Niki Groce, executive director of Longview Symphony; and Elizabeth Mitchell, executive director of Longview World of Wonders.
 In the letter, the organizations implored Mack to consider allowing them to have an outdoor event, noting that the pandemic has threatened their “sustainability.” They noted that outdoor events might appeal to some patrons who are not yet ready to resume indoor activities. They also stated that outdoor activities could be conducted by requiring face masks and social distancing to “make them as safe as possible.”
 “We respectfully ask that you begin approving requests for outdoor events in Longview,” they wrote. “The viability of many organizations in the city’s highly valued Cultural District and many others may, very literally, depend on it.”
 Mack said since the governor issued his executive order, he has not approved any requests for outdoor events.
 “Look, I hate that we can’t have events. I miss going to them, I miss being involved in them,” Mack said. “But I don’t miss having hospitals full of COVID-19 patients.
 “I understand they’re all hurting,” Mack said, referring to the arts organizations. “So is every business in Longview. That doesn’t mean we can jump ship and say, ‘OK, because we’re hurting, we’re going to abandon the principles of science and reason.’ “
 Mack said he does not have jurisdiction over indoor gatherings. Those gatherings on private property must abide by the governor’s orders related to capacity restrictions, social distancing and other guidelines.
 The city of Longview has canceled most of its events, including recently announcing the cancellation of the Christmas parade, and has limited activities at the Longview Convention Complex, which includes Maude Cobb, Mack said.
 Earlier this month, the Harvest Festival, which is typically held in Longview at the convention complex, moved to Henderson.
 Some people in the community were confused this past week, however, when the Longview Arboretum and Nature Center held its Spooky Fest on its grounds. The outdoor event was attended Thursday by more than 10 people.
 City spokesman Shawn Hara said this past week in response to a question to the twice-weekly Answer Line column that the arboretum did not request the mayor’s approval for the event.
 “However, I spoke with a representative from the Arboretum several weeks ago and they said they were not planning for it to be an event ‘per se’ that would require permission under the governor’s order,” Hara said in an email. “At the time, they said they were just planning for the gardens to be open as normal for guests and would be providing candy and encouraging guests to dress in costume. They said they weren’t doing anything that would be a gathering of 10 or more people.”
 Hara noted there are exceptions under the governor’s orders in which activities can occur without requesting permission. According to the governor’s orders, a 75% outdoor occupancy limit applies to outdoor areas, such as swimming pools, zoos, natural caverns, amusements parks and water parks. Additionally, restaurants can allow outdoor dining with no capacity outdoors; indoor restaurant dining is limited to 75% occupancy, according to the governor’s orders.
 “It would be our hope that any organization wishing to host activities would follow the governor’s guidelines and ensure health and safety practices are followed,” Hara said.
 Mack said in limiting large outdoor activities, his hope is to curb the spread of the coronavirus.
 “We don’t want to be responsible for creating an outbreak that we don’t need in our community simply because we allowed a large event to happen,” Mack said.

French forces intervened in recent years against Islamic extremists in Mali and Syria, both former French holdings. Thousands of French soldiers are now stationed in former colonies in the Sahel region of Africa with the same mission.
 A French military presence fuels routine online appeals from IS, Al-Qaida and other extremists for retaliation on French soil, in hopes of forcing France to withdraw its forces.
 STRICT SECULARISM
 Much of the current anger stems from the recent republication by French satirical newspaper weekly Charlie Hebdo of caricatures depicting the Prophet Muhammad. The cartoon images of Islam's founder deeply offended many Muslims, who see them as sacrilegious. But the cartoons were originally published in Denmark in 2005, and similar images have been published in other countries that hold freedom of expression dear.
 While French officials often say their country is targeted because of its reputation as the cradle of human rights and a rampart of global democracy, what distinguishes France most is its unusual attachment to secularism.
 The often-misunderstood concept of French secularism is inscribed in the country's constitution. It was born in a 1905 law separating church and state that was meant to allow the peaceful coexistence of all religions under a neutral state, instead of a government answering to powerful Roman Catholic clerics. Crucifixes were at one point torn from classroom walls in France amid painful public debate.
 A century later, polls suggest France is among the least-religious countries in the world, with a minority attending services regularly. Secularism is broadly supported by those on both left and right.
 As the number of Muslim in France grew, the state imposed secular rules on their practices. A 2004 banning Muslim headscarves and other ostentatious religious symbols in schools remains divisive, if not shocking to many outside France. A 2011 law banning face veils made Muslims feel stigmatized anew.
 OUTSPOKEN PRESIDENT
 France has been hit with extremist attacks over recent decades under leaders across the political spectrum, but centrist President Emmanuel Macron is a particularly popular target. Protesters burned his portrait or stomped on it at protests in multiple countries this week.
 That's in part because of a law Macron plans to introduce to crack down on Islamist fundamentalists he contends are turning some communities against the state and threatening pillars of French society, including schools. In the wake of recent extremist attacks, his government expelled Muslims accused of preaching intolerance and shut down groups seen as undermining French laws or norms.
 The words the president uses have provoked outrage as well. He said the planned law was aimed at Islamist "separatism," which raised fears of the further alienation of French Muslims.
 At a memorial for a teacher beheaded for showing the prophet caricatures to his class, Macron gave a speech extolling tolerance, knowledge and religious freedom. But he drew ire, including from Turkey's president, for saying, "We won't renounce the caricatures" and that France should "diminish Islamists."
 Earlier, Macron described Islam as a "a religion that is in crisis all over the world," with positions "hardening" in many Muslim countries.
 And as calls for anti-French protests mounted, he tweeted: "We will not give in, ever."

 Tariffs have also hit French, German, Spanish and UK wine as well as raspberry and lingonberry jam from France and Germany, for instance. Matters could escalate if the EU imposes tariffs on U.S. products in retaliation for tax breaks given in the past to Boeing.
 Trump has used strong language about Europe's trade surplus with the U.S., saying that the EU is “worse than China” and “has been treating us very badly” with “barriers that are incredible.”
 Some observers have expressed the hope that Biden could send a message by dropping the tariffs that Trump slapped on European steel and aluminum, enraging the Europeans and other allies by calling their metals a threat to U.S. national security. The so-called Article 232 proceeding both hurts European producers and raises the cost of steel for American companies. Europe retaliated by raising tariffs on U.S.-made motorcycles, bourbon, peanut butter and jeans.
 Claudia Schmucker, a trade expert at the German Council on Foreign Relations, said that “it would be a major sign of willingness to work with the EU” if Biden were to announce shortly after taking office that he intends to suspend the steel and aluminum tariffs, much as Trump repudiated the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal with Asian countries excluding China as one of his first official acts. There are hopes Biden would take a more rules-based approach based on the World Trade Organization, an international forum for resolving trade disputes.
 But analysts caution those with such high hopes might be disappointed: Biden “will focus on U.S. national interests and U.S. economic recovery, and if he has a feeling that this would be detrimental he might not do it,” Schmucker said.
