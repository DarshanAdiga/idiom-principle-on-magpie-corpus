“It is much easier to wash the graffiti off the wall then it is to work against and work to reform systems of injustice for our black and brown siblings,” Community Christian Church Senior Minister Shanna Steitz said.
 Steitz says they are working to clear graffiti that glorifies violence against police.
 “But also leaving some of the graffiti to give voice, continued voices. So we don’t just white wash away the voices of anger and frustration and grief and sadness. So we’re trying to balance that,” Steitz said.

 This year's award was given to Linesman Scott Gillespie, the first recipient of the award since it's creation.
 In an FPHL release, Gillespie remarked that "It was a true honor to work with Jim every night that I came to the David S. Palmer Arena. He was always so happy to be there and ready for whatever the night threw at us..."
 Hebermehl lived his entire life in Danville and taught in the local school system for 34 years. He was respected both on and off the ice, and is remembered fondly by coaches, players and officials both on and off the ice.

The best summer cocktail is a margarita on the rocks, especially when the beach is involved. But it takes a lot of work to squeeze all of those limes by hand, and sometimes the whole point of sipping on a margarita is to relax.
 Thankfully, Costco sells tasty pre-bottled margaritas for when you want to avoid all of the hard work. We previously reported on the original flavor made with agave wine, and it turns out there is a strawberry version, too. It's destined to be your go-to drink for the summer.
 Spotted by Instagrammer @mrs.ashleyirving, the Premium Strawberry Margarita comes from Kirkland, which is Costco's own label. Because it's made with 100% de agave wine, it is _technically_ a margarita wine cocktail. But at 1.5 liters, these bottles are the size of not one but two whole bottles of wine.

Biden's softer style may foreshadow how he presents himself in the five months before the presidential election, emphasizing calm and competence as a contrast to a mercurial president. It is an approach that carries the risk of being drowned out by Trump's much louder voice.
 On Monday evening, Trump declared himself "the president of law and order" from the White House as military police and law enforcement fired tear gas and cleared protesters from nearby Lafayette Park. Biden made no mention of the unfolding events during an online fundraiser that took place at the same time, though he talked at length about persistent racism in the U.S.
 "He's not in office, and he certainly does not have the megaphone like the person currently occupying the White House does, but I do think our people are looking for someone who can make them feel better during these extremely tough times," said Rep. Val Demings of Florida, whom Biden is considering as a running mate. "America just needs to be reassured that there's someone who's understanding, someone who's willing to say, 'Yes, we do have some issues,' and someone who's willing to address it."
 Biden delivered a well-received address on Friday calling on white people to shoulder the responsibility of ending America's systemic racism. But he was largely out of sight over the weekend, which marked the fifth anniversary of the death of his son Beau Biden from brain cancer.
 Biden and his wife, Jill, marked Memorial Day by laying a wreath at a veterans' memorial near his Wilmington home last week, and the former vice president's campaign posted pictures of him visiting a protest site in the city on Sunday afternoon. Earlier, he wrote a post on Medium expressing empathy for those despairing about the police killing of George Floyd.
 In the early moments of Monday's gathering at the Bethel AME church in Wilmington, Biden listened quietly and took notes. All the attendees, including Biden, wore face masks but lowered them as they spoke.
 "The vice president came to hear from us. This is a homeboy," pastor Sylvester Beaman said before everyone bowed their heads in prayer.

Une décennie après la dernière récession mondiale, l’establishment économique fait un demi-tour complet en matière de doctrine sur l’austérité. En 2010, le FMI faisait l’éloge du plan britannique de réduction du déficit. Il recommande maintenant au contraire d’augmenter fortement les dépenses budgétaires pour faire face à la pandémie de coronavirus. Les politiques aimaient autrefois citer les recherches de l’économiste Kenneth Rogoff pour tirer la sonnette d’alarme sur le fait que des dettes publiques dépassant 90 % du PIB d’un pays freineraient la croissance. Aujourd’hui, le même M. Rogoff conseille de dépenser davantage. Mais Alberto Alesina, un économiste de l’Université de Harvard décédé le 23 mai dernier, a tenu bon.
 Dans un livre écrit avec Carlo Favero et Francesco Giavazzi et publié l’année dernière, M. Alesina a une fois de plus défendu l’austérité – à condition que les bonnes politiques soient utilisées. Les hausses d’impôts pourraient nuire davantage à la croissance économique que les réductions des dépenses publiques – ce qui, dans certains cas, pourrait en fait stimuler l’économie, peut-être parce que les investisseurs s’attendent à ce que leur future charge fiscale soit moins lourde. D’autres économistes ont critiqué les résultats. Pourtant, M. Alesina n’a pas hésité à s’exprimer de manière dissidente. Ses articles – et il y en a eu des tonnes – montrent que les démocraties, et en particulier son Italie bien-aimée, ont tendance à accumuler la dette publique. Il fallait bien que quelqu’un rappelle aux politiques les dangers d’une politique fiscale insoutenable.
 "M. Alesina a une fois de plus défendu l’austérité – à condition que les bonnes politiques soient utilisées. Les hausses d’impôts pourraient nuire davantage à la croissance économique que les réductions des dépenses publiques"
