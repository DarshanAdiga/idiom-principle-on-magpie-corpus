COLUMBIA, S.C. (WIS) - A 28-year-old Richland Two teacher has died from complications of COVID-19, district officials confirmed Wednesday.Demetria (Demi) Bannister was a third-grade teacher at Windsor Elementary School. She had been in the teaching profession for five years.“I want to express my sincere condolences to Ms. Bannister’s parents, relatives, friends and school family," Richland Two Superintendent Dr. Baron Davis said in a statement. "While gone from us too soon, Ms. Bannister’s legacy lives on through the lives of the students she taught in her five years as a dedicated educator. To honor Ms. Bannister’s memory I ask the Richland Two family to join me in reaffirming our commitment to doing all we can to provide premier learning experiences for all students in the safest environment possible and doing our part to slow the spread of COVID-19.”Some former co-workers describe her as a teacher who went above and beyond for her students, and who had a passion for the arts..Patricio Aravena is the music teacher at Windsor and says watching Bannister break out dance moves in the middle of the hallway was normal.“She provided us with a lot of character,” Aravena said.“Known as Windsor’s Songbird, Ms. Bannister used her musical talents to bring a great deal of joy to our school,” said Denise Quickel, principal of Windsor Elementary. “For our school’s Attendance Matters kickoff in 2019 she wrote a song about the importance of coming to school to the tune of ‘Old Town Road’. The song and video were a big hit with our school family. Ms. Bannister loved her students and never missed an opportunity to advocate for students and public education.”Richland Two says Bannister was last inside the Windsor Elementary building on Aug. 28 during the final teacher workdays at the school.She was not showing symptoms at that time and all cleaning protocols were followed, the district said.Richland Two was notified of Bannister’s positive COVID-19 test on Sept. 5. An email was sent to Windsor Elementary staff that day explaining the 28-year-old teacher was hospitalized due to the virus. She died Monday, Sept. 7.While this school community is grieving, they’re trying to stay positive.“If she was around, she would say something along the lines of, ‘come on guys, you know you should cheer up. You should keep going on and just make people happy,’” Aravena said.Bannister’s co- workers say her joyful spirit and love for students will live on inside the Windsor Elementary building.To leave a message for Ms. Bannister’s family, click or tap here.Copyright 2020 WIS.

HAMPTON - For 15 years, one feathered companion has joined lobsterman John Makowsky on his trips to sea on his boat the Intrepid - a seagull named Red Eye.


   


  The gull has greeted Makowsky on almost every trip he has taken out of Hampton Harbor to the Gulf of Maine since 2005, staying all day to rest on his bow or eat fish from his hand. It's a friendship that proved vital to Red Eye's survival when the bird showed up this summer with a badly injured left leg.


   


  Makowsky captured Red Eye at sea so he could bring her to the Center for Wildlife in Cape Neddick in York, Maine, for rehabilitation. The bird was released later this summer, fully healed and back to her spot on Makowsky's bow.


   


  "Red Eye's been my girl," said Makowsky, 70. "She's the one that always comes through."


   


  Makowsky had been fishing in Hampton for about three years when Red Eye first appeared, having moved to New Hampshire in 2000 after spending 25 years fishing in Connecticut. Red Eye started hanging on the back side of the Intrepid at first, then worked her way to the front of the boat. Unlike other birds who land on the boat and keep their distance, Red Eye stood right in front of Makowsky on the other side of his cabin window.


   


  For the next 15 years, she returned daily, recognizable by a red ring around her eye that Makowsky said was particularly bright when she was younger. He said he recognizes Red Eye not only for her features but also her mannerisms, like the way she hops from one part of the boat to another. He said she has been noticeably missing a feather on one of her wings in recent years. He said he is confident Red Eye is female based on observations like her flights to and from the direction of the Isles of Shoals where he suspects she has raised fledglings over the years.


   


  Their bond has grown over the years, Makowsky becoming friendly by feeding Red Eye fish from his hand in the window. Only in the last four years has Makowsky been able to pull out his camera without startling her, and now she is much less camera shy.


   


  "It's certainly unique," said Will Shaheen, who works on Makowsky's boat. He said he has his own gulls he recognizes at sea that he is able to feed from his hand as well, but "not any that are around all the time like Red Eye is."


   


  One day in June Red Eye showed up to the boat with a hurt leg, bent so that she was standing on the top side of her foot. Makowsky knew the injury meant Red Eye's life could be in jeopardy.


   


  "It was heart-breaking to see her trying to scramble around on one leg," said Makowsky. He called the Center for Wildlife, who told him that they would rehabilitate Red Eye if he was able to catch her. That proved to be a challenge, as while Makowsky started bringing a net with him to sea, Red Eye refused to even approach the window while it was in the boat.


   


  "I pretty well had given up," said Makowsky. After three weeks, he decided to give it one last try with the net when Red Eye finally was hungry enough to come near the window. He caught her and with his crewman's help brought her into shore.


   


  At first, the Center for Wildlife staff members were doubtful Red Eye would recover, as she was refusing to eat and losing weight. He said they became optimistic, though, when she finally ate food Makowsky brought a week later.


   


  "She ate that fish right down. They saw how attached I was," said Makowsky. "They redoubled their efforts."


   


  Makowsky said they used a variety of medical and therapeutic approaches to healing Red Eye's leg, from nerve medicines to massages to wearing a boot that helped straighten the leg. A few weeks later they brought Red Eye out to sea where they released her back into the wild. When Makowsky returned to sea a few days later, Red Eye was back again.


   


  "Everything seems perfect now," said Makowsky of Red Eye's health.


   


  Caring for Red Eye has renewed his inspiration to keep fishing at a time when he said he is contemplating retirement. He has fished since the 1960s, starting with his family business that fished in the Rhode Island Sound. He said he would like to stop fishing soon, although his wife would like him to keep going a little while longer.


   


  "I'm not going to do it forever," Makowsky said. Getting Red Eye healed, he said, will be a good cap on his career at sea.


   


  "I'd like to stay in maybe as long as she's coming out," said Makowsky. "She might stay in the business out there longer than me."

The beloved stories of A.A. Milne have been previously adapted by Disney into several beautifully animated and heartwarming motion pictures. So it’s especially cloying that Marc Forster’s “Christopher Robin” just plops these timeless characters into a tepid and cookie-cutter family flick about a dad who -- gasp! -- spends too much time at work, and rediscovers his inner child thanks to the return of his old, magical friends. Ewan McGregor shines as the adult version of Christopher Robin, but the melancholy cinematography, underdeveloped screenplay and creepy VFX renditions of Pooh and his friends make “Christopher Robin” a rough slog.

Kimmes also shared that the hospital district “does not even break even on reimbursement from Medicare and Medicaid,” which amounts to around 70 percent of the district’s patients, he asserted. He also argued the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has put a financial strain on the hospital, which is an independently owned enterprise and does not receive support from a larger health system.


  Last year, district voters rejected an identical proposal by a margin of 182 votes. While the communities of Bingen and While Salmon approved the measure by clear majorities, the proposal had a tougher time winning over voters in the more rural areas of the district. Nearly double the voters rejected the proposal than approved it in the Dallesport precinct, for example.


  Asked why he believes the proposal failed last year, Kimmes said, “Although we can’t be certain, we believe we could have done a better job communicating about the levy to the voters in the hospital district.


  “We will be doing a better job of communicating about the levy proposal. The Skyline Foundation has created a levy campaign committee that will be leading the communication efforts. Extra communication efforts will take place in the outlying areas of the district where the proposal failed,” Kimmes said.


  “The campaign committee will also be informing the community of all the things Skyline Health and its staff did to prepare for the COVID pandemic and to care for the community during this difficult time,” he continued.

“Playing in the morning you have to take advantage of it because tomorrow, l think even par is going to be fantastic,” he said. “A few greens today were releasing 20 yards already, and that’s only in the morning. Tomorrow I’m going to have to battle the heat, battle the firmness of the greens, and it’s going to be a little bit more challenging, for sure.”


  Kang didn't have a flawless day. Even with seven birdies, she was slowed by three-putt bogeys on the 14th, 16th and the first green after making the turn. On the last one, she missed from inside 3 feet on her par putt. Instead of getting angry, she figured out the problem and rolled it well the rest of the day.


  On the fifth hole, she didn't have to roll it much.


  Kang drilled a 5-iron from 191 yards that landed in the middle of the green and rolled toward the pin. She had trouble seeing, but not hearing. A woman sitting on a hill by the green screamed out, “Get in the hole!” Kang had no trouble identifying who it was.


  “My mom,” she said. “Yeah, this was the first time she got to come watch me play this entire year, so I'm really excited and happy about that.”


  Her mother was excited, too, at least on that shot.


  “She sometimes doesn't even know if I made a birdie or not,” Kang said. “She just keeps taking off. I tell her, ‘Can you just watch instead of running off to the next hole?’”

Leaders of North Texas arts nonprofits met Wednesday to talk budgets.


  As the nation emerges, Punxsutawney Phil-like, from pandemic shutdown, performing and visual arts groups want to continue hosting exhibits, staging plays and celebrating festivals.


  But with an economic downturn shuttering businesses and thrusting workers into unemployment, nonprofit groups might be doing all of that on a smaller budget. On Wednesday, the Dallas-based Business Council for the Arts hosted an online forum to talk fundraising and budgeting in the time of COVID-19.


  Betsy Lewis, the development director for Cedars Union, a cooperative that serves artists with studios and a maker space, Holly Hull Miori, the development and alumni relations director for the Ackerman Center for Holocaust Studies & School of Arts and Humanities, and Kaitlin Guthrow, director of sponsorships and nonprofit relations for North Texas Giving Day - Communities Foundation of Texas, were the panelists for the virtual gathering.


  The panelists said arts groups are funded by big donors — often corporate sponsors who donate thousands of dollars to programs and events — and individuals who give less than $100.


  "I would say that they're both equally important," Guthrow said. "Those big donors can help propel your mission further, and help you reach your goals faster. But you don't want to become too dependent on a small number of large donors. If I had to pick between one $1,000 donor or 10 $100 donors, I would choose the latter every time. Because if that one drops off, particularly in a challenging year like this year, then you've got to start completely over."


  Miori said she'd take "a hybrid," of big and small donors. The big donations generate publicity and dollars, she said.


  "But these small gifts bring a lot of momentum with it, and they tend to be with you for a longer time," Miori said. "These gifts tend to be with you 10, 20 years and they can also be better planned giving prospects."


  In other words, individuals who give smaller amounts over a decade or longer plan to give cash, equity or property more often than companies do.


  "I would add that a sponsorship is not necessarily big and the individual donation is not necessarily small," Lewis said. "The healthiest way to approach it - if you're in an organization that has the staff and volunteers for it - is to diversify just like a stock portfolio, so that your fundraising efforts are not completely dependent... on one avenue of fundraising."


  Denton nonprofits have been weathering the COVID-19 storm. Joshua Butler, the founder and director of Thin Line, a local documentary film, music and photography festival, said his team canceled in-person screenings and all live music showcases last March. Instead, Butler's new business, Falcon Events, screened films online, at the festival website.


  "Virtual, for one, is cheaper," Butler said. "So you automatically have a reduced budget across the board. Thin Line is in a good position where we can pivot quickly. We don't have employees or staff. The virtual festival is pretty inexpensive. I don’t have to worry about hotel rooms and hospitality and car services."


  Screening the festival online brought in an audience that tripled attendance 2019. More than 7,000 people signed on to the Thin Line virtual fest.


  Thin Line is free, and is funded mostly by corporate sponsors.


  "Every single one of those sponsors got a lot more eyeballs than they would have in the screening spaces, so they got a lot more value."


  Butler said the 2021 festival will be virtual, too.


  "We're going to be virtual next year and then see what the next year brings," he said. "We know other nonprofits aren't in a position to pivot like we did. I started Falcon Events to do virtual conferences and Thin Line was its first event. For us, our costs for next year are reduced. Basically, all we have to pay for is the content."


  Panelists said that while COVID-19 was a sucker punch for nonprofit arts groups, the pandemic reminded leaders and volunteers of analog methods for staying in touch with donors and North Texans who come to their exhibits, performances and programs. Donors told nonprofit board members and directors they enjoyed handwritten notes, and leaders said they found ways to use promotional merchandise that didn't work before the pandemic. Bumper stickers that arrived with too-small text turned into swag to stuff bags and envelopes with. Reluctant board members dropped the word "fundraising" from their vocabulary and instead made thank-you calls to donors that often yielded more giving.


  Guthrow said small donations will likely still make up the bulk of charitable giving and support for arts groups. In about one week, Guthrow and her team will preside over a sprawling, daylong fundraiser that will generate millions of dollars for thousands of nonprofits.


  "North Texas Giving Day is all about inspiring individual giving," she said. "You look at what the largest component of philanthropy in this country is, it's individual giving every single year. To the tune of about 70 percent. Foundation grants make up about 16 (percent), corporate giving (is) about five (percent). So individual giving really is the bulk of it. Never underestimate the power of 'small donor' because if you look at last year, what the community of North Texas donors raised was $50 million for over 3,000 nonprofits. Sixty percent of those gifts were under $100."


  Miori said nonprofits have to evaluate their successes and their failures. The Ackerman Center is part of the University of Texas - Dallas, and Mirori said the center has enjoyed support from the community, but not as much from university alumni. The center has elected to put more resources into promoting the center among graduates.


  "We've staffed up to do better, and we're getting there," she said. "We've had to continued to do things to make alumni want to come back (and give)... We celebrate a $2 gift and we celebrate a $1,000 gift."


  Miori said she's getting a lot of questions about raising money during a pandemic. Her answer: It's time for creative people to use that creativity to keep fulfilling their missions.


  "We're making it up as we go," she said. "We're writing it all down, and hopefully we'll never have to do this again."

On the surface, the Patriots look healthy as the team had just one player - Yodny Cajuste - missing from Thursday's practice. However, the team's injury report shows that the team has a handful of marquee players dealing with health issues with their first game soon approaching.


   


  On Thursday, Stephon Gilmore popped up on the practice report with a hamstring injury. The Pro Bowl cornerback was limited during the practice and it's unknown if he suffered the injury during the session or the day before. Gilmore enters this season as the Patriots best player. Losing the 2019 NFL Defensive Player of the Year would certainly be a big blow, so his status at Friday's practice is worth monitoring.


   


  Thursday also marked the second day in a row that Julian Edelman was limited with a knee injury. The receiver looked to be moving well during the media portion of practice, but it's unknown how much work he did throughout the entire session. Edelman heads into this season as the Patriots projected No. 1 receiver.


   


  Gilmore wasn't the only player to newly appear on the injury report on Thursday as Dalton Keene was limited with a neck injury. The rookie tight end, who also plays fullback, was expected to play this weekend in the Patriots opener against Miami.


   


  Gunner Olszewski (foot) and Cassh Maluia (knee) were also limited on Thursday. Maluia returned to practice after missing Wednesday's session. Chase Winovich (shoulder) was a full participant after being limited to start the week.


   


  Typically, players who miss Friday's practice do not play when the Patriots suit up on Wednesday, so we have a lot to watch over the next 24 hours.


   


  With Cajuste, it seems that the 2019 third-round is off to a tough start with his career. After missing all of last season due to a lower body injury, the Patriots are placing the offensive tackle on the injured reserve, according to a source.


   


  Cajuste was expected to compete for the starting right tackle position, but missed time this summer in training camp and now will be on the injured reserve for at least three weeks. According to a source, the tackle's injury isn't considered season ending and he's expected to return at some point this year.


   


  ESPN was the first to report the news on Cajuste.

Marion’s boys tennis team is entering the most important part of its 2020 season.


  The North Central Conference (NCC) championship is just over a week away and less than three weeks remain until the Giants try to defend their Marion Sectional and Regional titles.


  An important day of NCC matches looms on Saturday in Richmond, and Marion used its 4-1 win over Shenandoah Wednesday on Bill Beekman Courts as a tune-up to prepare to battle the host-Red Devils and Muncie Central for the top-seed in the conference’s East division.


  All four of Marion’s wins came in straight sets, but the level of skills possessed by the Raiders meant the Giants had to earn every one.


  “Shenandoah is a real scrappy team and they fought from beginning to end on all the courts,” said Giants coach Doug Porter. “I thought (seniors) Vikram (Oddiraju) and Jack (Fauser) had slow starts, but once they got going they were in control. Even Jack, a 6-1, 6-1 score was about an hour-and-a-half match. All three of the singles players for Shenandoah were back from last year so I knew they would be competitive.”


  Oddiraju earned an efficient, 6-2, 6-0 win over senior Lance Holdren at No. 1 singles to pick up the Giants’ first point. It was his 10th triumph in 12 matches this season and No. 70 of his career, which moved him into a tie for 20th on Marion’s all-time wins list.


  Fauser’s win over senior Luke Weggener at No. 2 singles not only moved his season record to 11-1, it was win No. 75 of his career and moved him past Porter (Class of 1990) and three others into a tie for 12th all time with Joe Lee (1973) and David Dennison (1984).


  “You couldn’t ask for someone greater to eclipse you on the all-time list. He certainly deserves it,” Porter said of Fauser. “You talk about a team player, you look at Jack Fauser. You look back at his career, he sacrificed a lot in terms of individualism. Singles is his love and his first two years he played doubles because that’s what was best for his team. Not one complaint.


  “Obviously, if you’re going to have 75 wins through three-and-half years of your career, you’ve had to have done very well every year,” he continued. “He did what was best for the team, he worked at it and it shows. He’s a very confident net player now in singles and he owes that to his doubles play … I’m just proud of him.”


  Junior Alex Spitzer scored the Giants match-clinching point with a 6-2, 6-4 decision over junior Clay Connor at No. 3 singles. Spitzer held a 4-1 advantage in the second set but relinquished three-straight games to Connor to even the score.


  Porter was pleased with how Spitzer maintained his poise and finished off his ninth win in 12 matches.


  “Alex had to figure out how to win it, which is a good sign for Alex,” he said. “That’s a maturity sign to figure out how to win that match. Good wins for our singles players.”


  Marion senior Clayton Drook and freshman Ryan Sebastian saw their 4-1, first- set lead at No. 2 doubles disappear, but quickly regrouped to earn a 6-4, 6-2 win over junior Will Jennings and freshman Landen Mathes.


  Porter is happy with the development shown by Drook and Sebastian, who have compiled an 8-4 record through the first half of the season.


  “Two doubles had a little let down in the first set, a big lead and let them back in it,” Porter said. “Played a strong game at 5-4 then took control in the second set. We’re getting better as a two doubles team. It takes a while to gel as a team so they’re figuring things out.”


  Porter’s No. 1 doubles team of senior Soren Bruehler and freshman Ryan Spitzer also appear to be figuring some things out, though it has yet to lead to a win for the first-year varsity duo.


  Bruehler and Spitzer waged a competitive battle with senior Stephen Myers and junior Calyb Toffolo before the Shenandoah duo captured a 7-5, 6-4 victory.


  “Bruehler and Spitzer, they put themselves into positions to win games. Before you can win sets you have to win games and they’ve had chances to win so many games,” Porter said. “They’re just not winning the close games, especially on our serve. You’ve got to take care of your serve.


  “We’re just not getting the job done with our first serves and our return of serves,” he continued. “…But the boys there have showed promise. They’ve shown they can compete. We’ve just got to win close games. Hopefully we start the second half the season, they get to the point that they can start doing that. I know that they have the ability.”


  Porter admitted wrestling the NCC title away from No. 11 Harrison will be a tough task for any of the other three teams that make the final four in Lafayette on Sept. 19. The goal now is simply for the Giants to earn the opportunity to play the reigning champs in the final match.


  Neither Marion (10-1) or Richmond should have much trouble with Muncie Central on Saturday, so the winner of the Giants and Red Devils will be the NCC East’s No. 1 seed and face the West’s No. 2, which most likely won’t be Harrison.


  The Giants saw a little bit of what the Red Devils bring to the courts in the eight-team Richmond Invite last Saturday. Both teams accumulated 36 points to tie for the team title.


  “Richmond will be a tough opponent and it will be really close,” Porter said. “It’s been that way with them for the past several years. It will be a good match and we’re looking forward to it.”

MONMOUTH -- The recipient of this year's Distinguished Young Alumnus honor has an extensive family history with Monmouth College, and his connection with his alma mater figures to remain strong for many years.
   
 Zak Edmonds followed his father, Jay Edmonds '71, uncle Chris Edmonds '74 and brother Adam Edmonds '99 to Monmouth, a school he said he knew he was destined to attend "since about second grade."
   
 "Monmouth is a special place, for sure," said Edmonds, who graduated in 2008 with a degree in communication and now lives in West Peoria, Ill. "I think one of the special things about it is the teacher-to-student ratio. It allows students to really get to know their professors, and it allows them to get to know us. I think it's an underappreciated element - that ability to have an open communication with the leaders on campus. It's one of the most important things I learned at Monmouth, and it didn't come in a textbook."
   
 People who know Edmonds are well aware of the college he attended, mostly because he is always wearing something from his large collection of Monmouth apparel. His devotion to his alma mater has included taking a position on the Alumni Board. While serving as a member of its Alumni Engagement Committee, Edmonds helped establish the "Tartan Talks" webinar series.
   
 Following his graduation from Monmouth, Edmonds worked for the national office of his Monmouth fraternity, Alpha Tau Omega; at CEFCU in Peoria, Ill.; and in the insurance field before his current position as a business development specialist for OSF HealthCare in Peoria.
   
 At OSF, Edmonds helped transform the employer relations team, expanding it from two workers to a team of 10. Among his professional accomplishments, he has helped OSF Holy Family and Monmouth College become more aligned by formalizing an internship program that benefits Monmouth students.
   
 While in high school, Edmonds volunteered at OSF St. Francis, and that volunteering spirit has stayed with him for the past two decades. Most notably, he is a key figure in the signature fundraiser event for the Hult Center for Healthy Living in Peoria, its annual lobster boil. He served as co- chair for the successful 2019 event, increasing the funding he's helped raise for the organization to $1.5 million.
   
 Edmonds has also been a volunteer at a variety of organizations, accumulating an extraordinary record of involvement and willingness to help others. When he agrees to becoming involved in a cause, he regularly takes on leadership roles and helps the organization thrive.

If you don't already own the game on a console but plan on getting the new version to see how it plays on the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, or Xbox Series S, you can also look forward to only having to pay the same price as the version available now. That might seem like a given, but as we've seen from other big announcements, not every game will maintain the standard $60 price tag when it comes to the new consoles. _Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War_ , for example, will cost $70 instead. It's likely that other games will follow suit even if they don't do so right at launch.


  It was also confirmed during the event that the next-gen version of the game would support cross-progression and cross-play between the generations which means if you're going from the PlayStation 4 version to the PlayStation 5, you won't lose anything in the process and can still play with your friends who don't upgrade right away.

SPRINGFIELD - Republicans who will serve on a special investigative committee looking into House Speaker Michael Madigan's role in a bribery scandal involving utility giant Commonwealth Edison said Wednesday they hope the Democratic leader will speak directly to answer questions.


   


  "This body, the special investigative committee, is the forum of which the speaker can come and state his position with regards to this statement of fact," Rep. Grant Wehrli, R-Naperville, said during a Statehouse news conference. "What in this statement of fact is not true, speaker? We need to know."


   


  Wehrli was referring to a deferred prosecution agreement filed in July in federal district court in Chicago in which officials at ComEd admitted that over a period of years they awarded lobbying jobs and contracts to close associates of Madigan in order to curry the speaker's favor for legislation that benefitted the company.


   


  The company has been charged with bribery, but as part of the agreement federal prosecutors said they will not pursue the case for at least two years in exchange for the company paying a $200 million fine and having its officials cooperate in an ongoing investigation.


   


  Madigan has not been charged with any crime and he has strongly denied any wrongdoing and has called the hearings a "political stunt." But on Friday, Sept. 4, a former ComEd lobbyist and senior vice president for governmental affairs, Fidel Marquez, was charged with bribery conspiracy for his role in helping orchestrate the scheme. Marquez is the first individual in the case to be charged.


   


  The special investigative committee will hold its first meeting Thursday in the Statehouse, but it is expected to be only an organizational meeting in which the six committee members will discuss the procedures they will use and a timetable for the investigation.


   


  A spokesman for Madigan said in an email Wednesday that because it is only an organizational meeting, the speaker does not plan to attend. But it remains unclear whether he will attend future hearings or agree to testify in person.


   


  The other Republicans on the panel include Rep. Tom Demmer, of Dixon, who will serve as the ranking member, and Rep. Deanne Mazzochi, of Elmhurst.


   


  "Illinois is fed up with decades of corruption," Mazzochi said. "That's why I ran for office, and I want corruption exposed and ripped out of our state government."


   


  The investigative committee process is separate from the criminal investigation that is ongoing. It was prompted under the House's own rules when three other Republican House members, led by Minority Leader Jim Durkin, of Western Springs, filed a petition with the speaker's office requesting the probe.


   


  The main task is to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to justify a formal charge and possible disciplinary action, up to and including expulsion from office. If the panel makes such a finding - which would require a vote from at least one of its three Democrats - a separate disciplinary committee would be formed to conduct what amounts to a trial.


   


  But conducting the legislative hearings amid the criminal probe could present complications because many of those from whom the committee members may want to hear - including Madigan, his former associates and officials at ComEd - may be targets of the criminal probe, and therefore anything they say in a legislative hearing could be used against them in a criminal case.


   


  "We'll invite them to share any and all information that they can share with the committee," Demmer said during the news conference.


   


  The hearings will also be different from a criminal trial because there are different standards of proof in the General Assembly. In a criminal trial, prosecutors have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant committed certain acts that constitute a crime, as defined in a statute. But that is not the standard that lawmakers use in an internal disciplinary proceeding.


   


  "It's about the integrity of the office. It's conduct unbecoming," Wehrli said. "To put it bluntly, basically bringing shame upon the office you hold."

There were some last-minute adjustments to the podium prior to Evan Neal’s Zoom call with the media Thursday afternoon.


  “You’ll have to give us a second,” an Alabama media representative said to reporters. “Evans a little bigger than...”


  “Than most,” the 6-foot-7, 360-pound offensive lineman interjected.


  Neal is tied for the tallest player on Alabama’s roster and has 10 pounds on fellow offensive lineman Deonte Brown as the Tide’s heaviest player. Although, don’t let that size deceive you. Neal is bigger than most, but he’s also more athletic.


  Earlier this offseason, the offensive lineman went viral when Alabama director of sports science Dr. Matt Rhea posted a video of him performing a dynamic coordination plyo jump. For those unfamiliar with sports-science lingo, just watch the clip.


  “That was my first time doing something like that,” Neal said Thursday. “Dr. Rhea and Coach (David) Ballou, they’re great strength coaches, they teach us different exercises and whatnot like that. I feel like, as far as my athleticism goes, I don’t want to give myself too much credit of anything like that, but I feel like largely that goes to the fact that I come from a family of athletes. I’m just a big athletic guy.”


  Neal’s teammates — and anyone else who has seen the clip — will tell you he’s being modest.


  “You don’t really see that too much happen from guys like that,” defensive lineman Phidarian Mathis said. “I just think he showed the world what he’s capable of.”


  The impressive jump isn’t the first time we’ve seen Neal flash his athleticism since arriving at Alabama. He earned Freshman All-SEC honors last season, starting all 13 games at left guard while allowing just one sack on 423 pass-blocking snaps. Although, while he’s made a few nice blocks, his most impressive feat might have come following an interception Tua Tagovailoa threw against Tennessee.


  While most marveled over Henry Ruggs III’s ability to chase down Volunteers defensive back Nigel Warrior to prevent a pick-six, a closer look at the play shows a great deal of athleticism from Neal as well. After Warrior intercepted the ball at the goal-line, Neal broke into a sprint from the 5-yard line in an attempt to run him down. While the lineman never had a chance of catching the defensive back, he raised some eyebrows, motoring downfield while passing by several lighter players in the process.


  “It was brought up by some of my teammates,” Neal said of the play. “That’s just how I was always taught to play ball. My father always taught me to always run to the football and maybe it’s going to get noticed even if at that time I wasn’t thinking it was going to be noticed but it did. Even if I didn’t have a chance to catch the guy, I was just trying to play with high effort.”


  Neal came to Alabama as the top offensive tackle and No. 8 overall player in the 2019 class. While he’s always been a top prospect, his athleticism has come a long way since joining the Tide. Neal estimates that he weighed around 385 pounds, 25 pounds heavier than his listed weight on Alabama's roster.


  While he says he still plans on trimming down a little bit, the new weight and agility should be beneficial as he looks to move from left guard to right tackle this season.


  “So far, the transition’s been treating me well,” Neal said. “In high school, tackle was my natural position, so I feel like it just made the transition go much more smoother for me. I have more work that needs to be done. I can get better, but all in all, I can say the transition has been going smooth for me. I’ve been pleased with my performance so far.”


  Last week, Nick Saban referred to Neal as the “prototype right tackle," stating he has the necessary size, length and conscientiousness to excel at the position. His fellow linemen tend to agree.


  “He was already a natural tackle, so there really wasn’t that much to it,” offensive tackle Alex Leatherwood said. “As far as him and his fall camp, he’s doing great. Way better than I would have expected.”


  Added Brown: “He’s a natural tackle. It hasn’t been a great adjustment. He’s a great athlete.”


  Neal said he has benefited from playing next to experienced players such as Leatherwood and Brown. This offseason, the sophomore said Leatherwood even took some extra time with him, helping readjust to the tackle position by bringing him out to the band field to work on different angles and punch times.


  “I’m really appreciative of that," Neal said. “It’s always good to have as much experience as we have in our room.”


  Alabama players will return to the field later Thursday as they are set to hold their 16th practice of fall camp. From there, Neal’s next chance to showcase his athleticism will come Saturday as the team holds its second scrimmage inside of Bryant-Denny Stadium.


  “Saturday’s scrimmage is extremely important. I feel like it furthers the training Coach Saban’s been having us do. It’s another opportunity to go out there and get better, fine-tune our craft so we can be ready come the first game.”

They're clearly loving parents to Matt, but as the film progresses, we are left to wonder whether or not they're playing too large a role in the life of their son as he enters his late twenties, and whether or not their distrust of the authorities represents creeping paranoia or a justified response to outrageous government interference.

MASSILLON Demolition work continues on the former Washington High School building making way for the Massillon City Schools' new operations facility.


   


  On Tuesday, crews were knocking down the former classroom portion of the school along Oak Avenue SE.


   


  Once that area is cleared later this week, John Petro, building and grounds supervisor, said people will get a good idea of the space available at the property to house the district's bus fleet.


   


  The $3.8 million operations facility will blend portions of the former high school with new construction. It will bring together district operations staff, including food service, IT, transportation and maintenance, as well as house the bus garage and a mechanic's bay. Knoch Corp. is the general contractor for the project, which began in June.


   


  "It's really going well," Petro said. "As it looks, it's messy but we are taking parts of this really nice old building and using it to our advantage."


   


  The operations facility has been in the works for many years.


   


  The bus garage, which occupies space at the armory near Washington High School, has had its problems from electrical to roofing issues, officials said.


   


  The district's mechanics are housed at the old high school.


   


  District leaders said the cost of operating both facilities has become a hindrance and costly. The cost to improve the two sites was not fiscally responsible, they said.


   


  District leaders had suggested the operations facility be constructed at the middle school property but the idea was abandoned after neighbors raised concerns.


   


  In 2017, architect John Patrick Picard revealed plans to convert the former high school into the operations headquarters, but those plans were put on hold.


   


  Picard revamped those plans by scaling back the project. The former high school site is ideal as it is centrally located.


   


  To keep costs down, the district will utilize portions of the former building to construct the new building. The pool will remain, Petro said.


   


  What's next


   


  Before the end of the year, work will begin on the inside of the building, Petro said.


   


  He said the rehabilitation will update systems such as the fire suppression and HVAC making the building more energy efficient.


   


  Stairwells will be renovated and an elevator will be installed to make the building handicapped accessible. The pool will get a new air handling system that will make the it more comfortable and consistent, Petro said.


   


  The building is slated to be completed in the spring. Petro said staff could move into the facility during the summer.

There were a lot of movies they haven't seen, like _Dr. Strangelove_ , so we did a slew of those, and have certainly returned to some. I've got things on my list, like there's a Russian film that's one of my all time favorite films, _Come and See._ But that's one where you very much have to be in the right mood, because those are two of the hardest hours you'll ever have watching a movie. I've got a few others I want to share, my favorite hidden classics like _Nil by Mouth_ and _Once Were Warriors_. There's an incredible film called _Red Road_. The other thing that we see is a lot of documentaries. We watched the _Beastie Boys Story_ , and the one about The Band, _Once Were Brothers_. There was that movie _Echo in the Canyon_ last year, and then there was that two-part series _Laurel Canyon_. We watched that, and the Linda Ronstadt film. I think I showed them _The Last Waltz_. So a lot of music docs, but we see a lot of docs generally. I think in the last week we saw _Mike Wallace Is Here_ , Alex Gibney's _Citizen K_ , and we saw two films about Russia the other night. The same night we saw _Citizen K_ , we watched _Red Penguin_ , about the Russian state national hockey team and when the Pittsburgh Penguins started getting involved in that. That was interesting. So we've seen a lot of docs, and I have these sort of running lists of documentaries, so that every night you can just go to a list, and any of these documentaries are sort of timeless. We've seen _The Biggest Little Farm_ and the _Halston_ one. We saw _Bluebird_ , and the David Crosby one.

After his breakout role as Pennywise in both installments of _IT_ , Bill Skarsgard has become a pretty popular actor in the genre movie landscape. Skarsgard has a slew of upcoming projects in the works -- but it sounds like he'll have to drop out of a pretty highly-anticipated one. During a recent interview with Collider, Skarsgard revealed that due to scheduling conflicts tied to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, he will no longer be able to appear in _The Northman_ , the upcoming film from _The Lighthouse_ director Robert Eggers. The film would have seen Skarsgard reunite onscreen with his brother Alexander Skarsgard, in their first project together since 2000's _White Water Fury._


  "No, unfortunately. It's been a scheduling nightmare during COVID," Skarsgard revealed. "It is what it is. It's a big shame. Eggers is one of the great filmmakers out there and working with my brother…I don't want to talk about it, it's going to make me burst into tears."


   _The Northman_ is set to be a Viking-era revenge tale set in Iceland at the turn of the 10th century, which will star Alexander Skarsgard, Nicole Kidman, Willem Dafoe, and Anya Taylor-Joy. As Eggers has previously explained, the film will have a different scope and scale from his work on _The Lighthouse_ and _The Witch._


  "The scale is so huge and there are so many more locations and things that I couldn't do everything or know every prop myself," Eggers explained this past April. "That's been a challenge with the new movie...There's many locations in the film, so we were constantly going on scouts to find places or reassess places that we have found and we're building sets there. We're designing all these worlds, building these villages, we're making thousands of costumes and props, training the horses the things they'll need to do, designing the shots of the films."

  "There's a lot more storyboarding," Eggers continued. "Generally I only storyboard the scenes that have visual effects or animals and stunts, things where all the departments need to be on the same page for it to work out. But this movie there is rarely a scene that isn't on a boat or doesn't have a lot of extras. We're storyboarding most of the film, which is taking a lot of time."

  Yodny Cajuste's NFL career is off to a tough start.


  According to a source, the Patriots are placing the 2019 third-round pick on the injured reserve. Cajuste missed all of last season with a lower-body injury and now will have to wait to make his NFL debut.


  Cajuste was expected to compete for the starting right tackle position, but missed time this summer in training camp and now will be on the injured reserve for at least three weeks. According to a source, the tackle's injury isn't considered season ending and he's expected to return at some point this year.


  It appears that the Patriots are starting Jermaine Eluemunor at right tackle. The team's primary backups are Korey Cunningham and rookie Justin Herron.


  ESPN was the first to report the news on Cajuste.

It probably resonated with more people in the film world than the music world, which is interesting, because a lot of people in the film world were almost shocked at how transparent it was.

So obviously, there was a lot of stuff in there that a lot of times doesn't get aired, because people only want to sort of promote the positive things, or whatever.

LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) — Nebraska voters won't get the chance to legalize medical marijuana this year after the state Supreme Court ruled Thursday that the measure set to appear on the November ballot is unconstitutional. The court's ruling was a win for social conservatives, including Gov. Pete Ricketts, who argued that the state shouldn't legalize a drug that isn't approved by federal regulators. The court also ruled that a measure to allow casino gambling can appear on the ballot, despite opposition from Ricketts and other conservatives who say it will contribute to gambling addiction and bankruptcies. The rulings came one day before the legal deadline to certify both measures for the general ballot. Justices concluded that the medical marijuana proposal violated Nebraska's “single subject rule” for ballot measures, which bars activists from bunching multiple issues into a single yes-or-no question for voters to address. Specifically, they took issue with provisions that would allow people to use marijuana while also produce it in-state, among other issues. “If voters are to intelligently adopt a state policy with regard to medicinal cannabis use, they must first be allowed to decide that issue alone, unencumbered by other subjects,” the court said in its opinion. Backers of both causes announced in July that they had gathered more than enough signatures to submit the issues to voters. They launched the campaign after Nebraska lawmakers repeatedly rejected measures to legalize casino gambling and medical marijuana. Gambling advocates also tried a ballot drive in 2016 but failed to gather enough signatures. Evnen said organizers of this year’s drive collected the required number of signatures to qualify. But he said letters submitted to him from the attorneys of gambling opponents pointed out what he...

The 107th Hiawatha Halloween Frolic is on!
 The Hiawatha Chamber and Visitors Bureau board met Wednesday night and made plans to move forward with the Halloween Frolic - although this year might look a bit different.
 The Halloween Frolic has been a tradition in Hiawatha since the first year of 1914 when founder Elizabeth Krebs threw together a small parade and Halloween party for the town's children to keep them busy and from vandalizing her flower gardens.
 Since then, the Frolic has grown into a town tradition that is actually the oldest running Halloween Frolic and Parade in the nation.
 HCVB President Kate Miller said she wants the public to be aware that while some protocol is being put in place to ensure the safety of the Hiawatha residents, that 2020 Halloween is happening.
 This year will go down in the books as yet another Frolic, complete with a parade and many other events that turn Hiawatha into a Halloween town. However, the HCVB board made decisions this week that while they are moving forward on plans for this year's Halloween Frolic, some changes will be made to keep social distancing in mind with the safety of Hiawatha's citizens as top priority due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 First and foremost, the evening Grand Parade will still happen at 7 p.m. on Saturday, Oct. 31. However, all residents are encouraged to participate - and congregating and watching from downtown is being discouraged at this time as is the norm. That doesn't mean that some people won't want to park along the parade route to see the many vehicles decorated for Halloween.
 The parade will be an all inclusive invitation to residents to decorate their vehicles and also any floats for Halloween and parade on the normal cruise routes of Oregon and First Street in Hiawatha. No registration will be required.

Algeri likes probing other die-hards' psyches with a hypothetical question: Would they rather the Bucs qualify for the playoffs 10 consecutive years but never reach the Super Bowl, or win a championship but then fail to reach the postseason for a decade?


  “A lot of people want to say Super Bowl, but I’m the opposite,” said Algeri, 38, a resident of Clearwater, Florida, whose streak of attending 152 straight home games will end this season because of the pandemic. “I want winning, even if we don’t get to the dance. It’s awful getting walked out of your stadium year in and year out. If we’re making it to the playoffs, you’re getting that hope.”


  To him, it doesn’t matter that Brady is, in Algeri’s words, “a borrowed player,” a quasi-mercenary forever associated with one team trying to bring glory to another. Brady’s presence confers instant hope, both for long- suffering fans and the next generation. Keith Kunzig, the superfan known as Big Nasty, speaks regularly to local children about drug prevention, and he said that he had encountered parents who struggled to raise Bucs fans. Why? Because, he said, they want to cheer for a winner.


  “What do you say to that as a parent?” said Kunzig, 53, of Largo, Florida. “We talk about loving the home team and being a homer. It has to do with the time in history these fans come in and also the relationships they get with their players.”


  To Algeri — and Barber, too — Brady conjures the arrival in 2002 of Jon Gruden, who that season coached Tampa Bay to its lone Super Bowl victory. On a team already brimming with defensive talent, and that had upgraded its offense during free agency, it was Gruden, Barber said, who provided the “absolute spark” that propelled the Bucs to a championship.


  “If you win right away,” Barber said in an interview, “you give everybody a reason to believe that just your presence alone pushed us over the edge.”


  Just as Gruden declared at the first team meeting that he was there to win a Super Bowl that season — “first words out of his mouth,” Barber said — Brady is governed by a similar urgency. He treasures each of his six Super Bowl wins. But his favorite, he likes to say, is the next one.


  Brady’s pursuit of a seventh title impelled him, with the pandemic shuttering facilities and canceling official activities, to improvise. With teammates to learn and a new offense to master, Brady arranged, through intermediaries, to use a practice field at Tampa’s Berkeley Preparatory School as his de facto home base.


  The headmaster, Joseph Seivold, promised him privacy and discretion even though, he said, Brady conveyed no such demands.


  “It was not a diva situation at all,” Seivold said.

It's also a case study in extremes; it's plausible, given years of disclosure of governmental dirty tricks, that accusations of child molestation would be used to silence an activist who has become privy to confidential information. By the same token, it's just as plausible that someone guilty of child pornography might weave a fiction around himself and his family to explain being the target of a federal investigation. Kennebeck's ability to work with both possibilities seems to have translated in access to players on both sides, from the DeHarts to the Tennessee prosecutors working the child pornography case.

When I hear the description in the Acts of the Apostles that the early Christian community held all things in common, I often wonder exactly how they did this. I think it must have had something to do with the gospel where Jesus talks about differences that might arise between people. In the gospel of St. Matthew, 18:15-20, that we heard last Sunday, he says that if someone sins against you, go privately to that person to discuss the matter. I think maybe they often had to push, to nudge each other to give everything to the common pot. It reminds me of our responsibility to nudge each other toward the love of God.


  When I think about myself, I have a friend who often gives me nudges. Sometimes when I say something about a concern, she will say things like “Let it go” or “It’s not going to do you any good to feel that way; it won’t help you or anyone else.” Or she might say “I guess you have to learn to forgive that” or “You are hanging on to that hurt. You have to let go of it.” I think this is what we have to do for each other when we hear someone complaining. We have to nudge them.


  Jesus had tried many times to explain things to the Pharisees, the synagogue leaders, to others, to all those who gathered to hear him. Finally, he did not keep pushing and pushing to get them to comprehend, because in many cases it didn’t work. So he nudged those who would really listen and they nudged each other, and a community began to form, a community based on the common good.


  Recently, I was conferring with sisters who are assisting at this time in Dooley Center, our care facility. Toward the end of our discussion, I asked if there was anything else I should know. One of them gave me a nudge when she said that with a recent issue, I had not kept them in the loop, and she was right. A nudge is a gentle way of saying “you need to do this, Esther” or “you need to change” or whatever the message may be.


  I also learned in that conversation of another way that we can nudge one another. One of them shared her interaction with an elder sister who was struggling with the confinement caused by the pandemic and by a continued decline in her physical health. She needed a consoling nudge. The caregiver listened to the sister who was struggling and heard her pain. When someone does this listening and attending to another’s pain and struggle, this is the nudge that eases their need to strike out, to react from their hurt or to put down others.


  The gospel passage speaks of three ways to push or nudge. First, you go to someone individually. If that doesn’t take care of the problem, you go with two or three or even more to talk about it reasonably if you can. But a third way is to go to God. Some years ago, women religious in the United States were having some difficulties in dealing with certain authorities in Rome. In their negotiations to resolve the issues, they sent delegations of sisters in ones, twos, and more. But when it wasn’t succeeding as they had hoped, they also had to rely on the third way. They had to turn to God in prayer. So in our lives, there are times when things don’t seem to work, despite our good efforts. But we always have that third way. We need to remember to try to nudge God.

HAMPTON - Hampton Beach Village District commissioners defended themselves against voters alleging they were negligently silent on this summer's closure of Ocean Boulevard in their Annual Meeting Wednesday.


   


  Former state senator Bob Preston, Sr. said during the meeting the impact of the road's closure on certain businesses and residents warranted a call from commissioners for the boulevard to stay open. The road, a state highway, was closed from May until this past Tuesday per the governor's order to allow for social distancing, and Preston was frustrated the Village District took no stance.


   


  "Never have I seen an elective body such as this not make a whimper as a substantial number of your constituents have been disenfranchised by the current situation on Ocean Boulevard," said Preston, who sent a petition with more than 700 signatures to the governor last month asking the road not be closed again.


   


  The comments came at the end of the Annual Meeting, in which the residents voted town-meeting style in the Hampton Beach fire station on Brown Avenue. Voters re-elected Maureen Buckley to her commissioner seat during polling hours in the daytime, then approved their $58,050 general government budget and $602,112 culture and recreation budget in the second half of the meeting.


   


  Preston spoke during the last portion of the meeting in which other business may be brought up, saying the closed boulevard was promoting unruly activity, causing heavy traffic on side streets like O Street and hurting businesses like Patriot's Corner, whose gas sales were down significantly.


   


  Commissioners responded by saying the matter was out of their hands and up to the governor, as well as supported by the Hampton police chief in a year where civil unrest was a concern.


   


  Buckley said the decision to close the road was born from a local task force run through the Chamber of Commerce that submitted recommendations to the governor for approval, not from the Village District. She said she has heard of a "misinformation" campaign in an effort to get her out of office with a write-in candidate, Kevin Hanlon, that alleged Buckley was responsible for the boulevard's closure. Buckley defeated Hanlon 104 votes to 31.


   


  "I'm not sure what the need to besmirch the reputation of the HBVD board is about," said Buckley. She said to Preston directly that she empathized with taxpayers and had personally spoken with business owners and residents about problems related to the boulevard.


   


  "First of all senator, you know I love you, but I have to tell you that I have spoken with Diane at Patriots Corner," said Buckley. "I want you to know that I do care very much about what happened to them."


   


  Preston, who received applause from several residents after he spoke, also questioned whether conflicts of interest existed between beach officials and those pushing to close the boulevard.


   


  Chuck Rage, the chairman of the commissioners, said he believes no conflicts of interest existed to cause the Village District to remain silent on the boulevard closing. He said his own hotels on Ocean Boulevard suffered from the road being closed because they normally get business from beachgoers driving by and stopping in.


   


  He has said he heard mostly support for the boulevard being closed from vacationers and locals who enjoy the "walking mall" it creates but would not want to bring it back in future years under the same traffic plan. He said he would oppose plans that brought traffic down side streets and would prefer to have traffic coming north from the bridge go directly onto Ashworth Avenue rather than down a stretch of Ocean Boulevard.


   


  "I do not ever want traffic sent down someone's neighborhood," said Rage.


   


  Wednesday's meeting was originally scheduled for March but postponed due to COVID-19. Rage said the Village District's attorney spent months determining how the meeting could be held safely given the virus, and Wednesday voters wore masks inside the building and were encouraged to sit socially distanced.


   


  The culture and recreation budget they passed was amended to subtract $309,701 from its original total of $900,813 to account for cancellations of major events like the Children's Festival, several bookings on the Seashell Stage and the Boston Circus Guild's September performance. That budget is funded by people who use their property to make money from the tourist industry.


   


  Residents with no businesses in the Village District only pay taxes on the general government budget, which was originally $10,600 higher but reduced through an amendment. Voters also elected Stephen LaBranche treasurer, Richard Reniere moderator, Ute Pineo clerk, Eileen Daboul supervisor of the checklist.


   


  Before the meeting adjourned, resident Timothy "Citizen" Jones questioned whether the Village District as a governing body was serving its purpose in providing its constituents with adequate representation.


   


  The commissioners have taken votes of support or opposition on issues in the past like the future reconstruction of Ocean Boulevard, but Buckley said the Village District commissioners never took a vote on the "walking mall" because it never came before the board. Rage said the commissioners couldn't take a vote because they haven't had a formal meeting since the second week of March.


   


  Commissioners said they maintained a strong respect for Preston, 91 years old, who served for years as a Democratic senator while his family ran businesses at the beach. Commissioner Bob Ladd credited Preston with having filed legislation years ago that created the Village District's two-tier tax system. Rage, who has known Preston for decades, said he loves the Prestons and hoped to work with the former senator in the future.


   


  "I'll do anything I can to help them," said Rage.

Argyle and Celina are connected at the hip. It doesn’t matter if they share a district schedule, line up across from one another in non-district, or draw each other in the postseason — the Eagles and Bobcats will face each other at least once every year. This year is no exception, though this time, the Eagles can bury their rivals in a rare early hole.


  Argyle (2-0 and the No. 1 team in Class 4A Division I) has a chance to win its 49th-straight regular-season game and hand the Bobcats their third loss of the season when it travels to Celina (0-2) on Friday for a 7:30 kickoff.


  In 13 previous meetings, Celina has never been winless coming in. Argyle coach Todd Rodgers knows that doesn’t matter.


  “It’s always been one of those deals with the Celina-Argyle matchup that it doesn’t matter what kind of record you have,” Rodgers said. “It’s going to be a tough, physical game. They’ve dropped down to Division II and have already faced Melissa and Paris, so they haven’t taken an easy path of preparation to get ready for district by any stretch of the imagination. They are going to be tough and well-coached, just like always.”


  Rodgers isn’t wrong. Argyle is 9-4 all-time against Celina, and the Bobcats seemingly always find clever ways to make things interesting. In 2015, Celina ended Argyle’s undefeated run with a 46-36 win in Week 3. Incidentally, both teams eventually advanced to a state title game that year, with Argyle in Class 3A Division I and Celina in Division II.


  In 2018, the Eagles beat Celina 63-21 in the regular season only to barely survive a third-round playoff scare from the same Bobcats, 26-22. Had it not been for a 28-yard touchdown catch by Cole Kirkpatrick with 25 seconds left on the clock, Argyle would have lost in the third round for the third year in a row.


  “We can go back and chart all the things in all the years we’ve played each other and find something offensively and defensively that has given us problems,” Rodgers said of Celina. “Some years, we’ve responded well to it, and other times we haven’t. We try our best to work on everything they’ve tried on us over the years.”


  On paper, Celina doesn’t have near the same cast of characters to slow down Argyle, but that doesn’t mean they won’t be just as formidable. _Dave Campbell’s Texas Football_ has Celina picked to win District 4-4A Division II, and running back Isaiah Martinez is projected to be the offensive MVP. Despite limited experience on Friday nights, Martinez came into the season as the featured running back and is working with an offensive line that is virtually intact from 2019. Defensively, the Bobcats return seven starters, including William Pace and Wyatt Stephens. Both combined for 13 sacks last year.


  The trick will be to keep up with the Eagles, who are again loaded on offense. Argyle is averaging 54 points per game in wins over Decatur and Texarkana Pleasant Grove, while Celina has scored a combined 27 points in its two losses.


  Quarterback C.J. Rogers has thrown for 489 yards and 10 touchdowns. Four of those scores have gone to Kirkpatrick, who is averaging 106 receiving yards per game. Cash Walker has 110 receiving yards and two touchdowns. Defensively, Argyle held Decatur to nine points in the opener and led 42-27 going into the fourth quarter against Pleasant Grove.


  “We’ve looked really polished,” Rodgers said. “I wasn’t entirely sure that would be the case this early in the year since we had lost both scrimmages. I’m pleased with the timing between the wide receivers and the quarterback, and I’m pleased with the way the offensive line has meshed together. Defensively, we’ve added nuances and managed to get those coached up. As long as we stay healthy, we should be fine with future games on the schedule.”

When 2006's “Tokyo Drift” convinced Universal it was sitting on a largely untapped goldmine, the studio re-hired director Justin Lin and reunited the original series cast for a proper relaunch. Unfortunately, virtually every new decision feels like an “ah, f--- it” solution to problems that subsequent films treated with much more nuance, especially reconnecting Brian, Dominic and the rest of Toretto’s outlaw crew. Meanwhile, an overlong finale set entirely in a cheap, phony-looking, CGI-enhanced underground tunnel robs the film of the tangibility -- and vitality -- that made Lin’s first “Fast and Furious” effort such a visceral delight.

The capacity of harmonics to compound into a morass of intermodulation products is insufficiently regarded by audio engineers. The test stimulus is just one tone, while music can contain hundreds of tones at any instant. Where you see several spikes on each graph, bear in mind that these are for _each_ discrete frequency; at any instant, music will contain dozens if not hundreds of these, as over any period even a single instrument's simplest sound contains multiple harmonics, and hence discrete frequencies, of its own.

GREEN Football schedules are typically the product of years of work, negotiations and relationships.
   
 Teams have most of their slate determined by their league games and although they don't always know which order their league foes will appear in on their schedule for a given season, six or seven opponents are already known before a single date is made official.
   
 The remaining games are nonleague contests and schools often have multi-year contracts with one another setting out home-and-away arrangements that allow them to know who they'll be playing outside their league a year or more in advance.
   
 Now, take all of that information, throw it out the window, toss the chaos of a global pandemic and its widespread health and societal impacts into the mix and try to cram all of the schedule-making into a matter of days and you have this season for the Green Bulldogs.
   
 "It was pretty crazy ... every day it was something different. From June through August we had about nine different versions of calendars for the season I sent out to our parents and kids," second-year Green head coach Mark Geis said.
   
 His team ultimately took the field for the first time in Week 2, hosting former Suburban League rival Tallmadge and earning a 27-20 win that wasn't on the schedule at all just a few weeks earlier. Putting together a schedule with Summit County health officials recommending teams not start their seasons until Oct. 1 and Green Local officials initially electing to adhere to those recommendations wasn't easy, but more plot twists were in store.
   
 "After the OHSAA made the announcement about the six-game regular season and the Federal League said, 'Let's get our schedule done,' our district initially didn't feel comfortable saying we're going to play games with the Summit County decision," Geis said. "So we got left off the (league) schedules and 10 days later, things changed when (Gov. Mike) DeWine announced that he was going to allow football to proceed."
   
 Following DeWine's announcement, Green officials decided that they would proceed with a full football season - or as much of one as could be assembled on a short notice. Some local districts, such as Coventry and Springfield, had their slate filled with league games. It was a matter of persistence and being willing to cast a wide net for Green athletic administrators and coaches, knowing there would be a lot of no's before getting enough opponents to say yes to a game.
   
 "I would say it was upwards of 40 to 50 different schools we talked to," Geis said. "Some already had their schedules set, but it was a lot of texts to coaches and emails to different districts."
   
 Some of those messages also went to fellow Federal League schools, who were able to point Green to schools they knew to be looking for games. The results, so far, include Westlake and Brush, two unfamiliar opponents for the Bulldogs. They'll battle Westlake at home and Brush on the road, with a Week 6 game against Lake the first Friday in October previously on the schedule.
   
 There are also tentative plans to play some of the remaining Federal League teams after the playoffs if both they and Green are eliminated from the postseason. That means, even with the season underway, the schedule still isn't a finished product for the Bulldogs. The remaining open dates on the slate could be filled if any teams have games canceled due to an opponent having to withdraw from the contest due to positive COVID-19 tests.
   
 Still, after sitting out Week 1 with no opponent, getting back onto the field on a Friday night was an exciting occasion for Green.
   
 "Our coaches just appreciated seeing our kids out there and I told them I felt like we were 1-0 before playing a game just to be able to make it to this point," Geis said. "Our players did all of the right things to be able to play, our coaches and parents and administrators all did the right things for us to be able to play."
   
 Having to watch other teams play in Week 1 without having a game was tough for the Bulldogs, Geis admitted, but now the season is underway and there's no looking back. Yes, there is the oddity of not playing for a league title - Green doesn't have a full slate of Federal League games so it won't have a chance to vie for the title - and the program has a junior class that went undefeated and won a league title in freshman football two seasons ago, but the old football cliche of looking to go 1-0 each week has been pushed to the forefront this fall.
   
 Since all teams will make the playoffs, that normal goal isn't on the table either, meaning each game is more of a standalone entity than normal. Combined with a senior group looking to make its mark in its final season in the program, the strong junior class and underclassmen on the roster have their eyes on a winning season and trying to advance in the playoffs next month. Add in the Week 6 tilt against geographic and league rival Lake and the Bulldogs still have a lot to play for in the weeks ahead.

GREENSBURG -- The Greensburg Police Department and Kiowa County Sheriff's Department were put on high alert Monday when an armed robbery took place at the Family Dollar Store in Greensburg.


   


  According to a police statement issued by Greensburg Chief of Police Aaron Webb, at about 2:35 p.m. two individuals entered the Family Dollar Store at 303 E. Kansas Ave. in Greensburg and approached the clerk. The female subject began talking to the clerk, and as soon as the cash drawer was opened, the man rushed around the counter, held the clerk at gunpoint, and began passing the money from the cash drawer to the woman.


   


  "The female subject was wearing a purple and white top with dark colored pants,"Webb said. "She is described as a biracial female, approximately 5 feet 7 inches tall, medium built. She also has a tattoo on the back of her neck, which appears to be of two birds."


   


  Webb said the man had a dark complexion and was wearing a maroon shirt and light blue ripped jeans. He had on a red hat with the sticker still on the bill. Both robbers were wearing face masks.


   


  Store video camera footage shows the two robbers leaving the building on foot, then getting into a newer model white Dodge Ram pickup.


   


  The police report said the vehicle appeared to missing the gas tank lid, and the vehicle was last seen headed west from Greensburg.


   


  The robbers have not been apprehended.

What Ben Duncan's article highlights to me is that in general, we really don't fully understand what makes a sound system sound good. There are products with relatively high distortion compared to others that are beloved based on listening. Others that would seem to be great based on the traditional measurements, but don't sound as good. If you dig deeply enough, you can usually discover why one product sounds more appealing than another. It might not be obvious, and the conclusion will almost certainly be contentious. But, you can often find it.

  On the surface, the Patriots look healthy as the team had just one player - Yodny Cajuste - missing from Thursday's practice. However, the team's injury report shows that the team has a handful of marquee players dealing with health issues with their first game soon approaching.


  On Thursday, Stephon Gilmore popped up on the practice report with a hamstring injury. The Pro Bowl cornerback was limited during the practice and it's unknown if he suffered the injury during the session or the day before. Gilmore enters this season as the Patriots best player. Losing the 2019 NFL Defensive Player of the Year would certainly be a big blow, so his status at Friday's practice is worth monitoring.


  Thursday also marked the second day in a row that Julian Edelman was limited with a knee injury. The receiver looked to be moving well during the media portion of practice, but it's unknown how much work he did throughout the entire session. Edelman heads into this season as the Patriots projected No. 1 receiver.


  Gilmore wasn't the only player to newly appear on the injury report on Thursday as Dalton Keene was limited with a neck injury. The rookie tight end, who also plays fullback, was expected to play this weekend in the Patriots opener against Miami.


  Gunner Olszewski (foot) and Cassh Maluia (knee) were also limited on Thursday. Maluia returned to practice after missing Wednesday's session. Chase Winovich (shoulder) was a full participant after being limited to start the week.


  Typically, players who miss Friday's practice do not play when the Patriots suit up on Wednesday, so we have a lot to watch over the next 24 hours.


  With Cajuste, it seems that the 2019 third-round is off to a tough start with his career. After missing all of last season due to a lower body injury, the Patriots are placing the offensive tackle on the injured reserve, according to a source.


  Cajuste was expected to compete for the starting right tackle position, but missed time this summer in training camp and now will be on the injured reserve for at least three weeks. According to a source, the tackle's injury isn't considered season ending and he's expected to return at some point this year.


  ESPN was the first to report the news on Cajuste.
