Such a development is, of course, highly unlikely to bear fruit, or even to significantly stand in the way of operators' 5G plans. However, it does prove the extent to which these views are widespread and entrenched.

As a rapidly growing market, India continues to be an exciting environment for 5G, as well as an inevitable proxy battleground for US-China tensions. India is increasingly phasing out Chinese influence in the telecoms sector, as the government is making it less appealing to work with these companies without introducing an explicit ban. Specifically with relation to 5G, the government gave the green light for telcos' 5G trials - except for those done in collaboration with Chinese vendors.

 LONDON, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Britain's government will launch a media campaign this week to urge people to return to their workplaces, ramping up Prime Minister Boris Johnson's calls to get economy back up to speed up after its hammering during the coronavirus lockdown.
 Data has shown only 17% of workers in British cities had returned to their workplaces by early August, and one of the country's business leaders said last week that big urban centres looked like ghost towns.
 "The next stage we'll look at is specifically the guidance on how to get back to work safely and we expect to see that later this week," Johnson's spokesman said, commenting on the government's ongoing public information campaign.
 Johnson's message is that returning to work will help stimulate the economy, the spokesman said.
 The government is hoping that the reopening of schools, which began in England this week, will help parents to get back to their workplaces after working from home since March in many cases.
 Some 4.6 million working households in Britain have children under the age of 16. If all of these households had to make changes to their working arrangements to provide childcare, that would have affected one in seven workers in the UK.
 Britain's economic output shrank by more than 20% in the April-June period, bigger than all other large industrialised nations and its recovery has been moderate by comparison.
 Many economists fear a sharp rise in unemployment as the government winds down its huge job retention scheme which is due to expire by the end of October. (Reporting by William James, additional reporting by Andy Bruce; editing by Kate Holton)

 WASHINGTON, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Senate Republicans are likely to take up their COVID-19 relief bill next week offering $500 billion in additional federal aid, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said on Tuesday, adding that the administration was still weighing help for U.S. airlines.
 In an interview on CNBC, Meadows said he expected Senate Republicans' legislation would be "more targeted" than House Democrats' offer and could either be used as a building block or be passed on its own while negotiations continue.
 Congressional negotiations on further federal intervention amid the novel coronavirus pandemic remain at a standstill after the Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives passed its $3.4 trillion measure back in May.
 Republican President Donald Trump and his administration have said they could support a $1 trillion bill. Democrats offered to split the difference with a roughly $2 trillion compromise, but there has been little movement.
 Meadows told CNBC the administration "was nowhere close" to Democrats' $2 trillion offer but added: "We'll get there in the end."
 It was unclear whether Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell planned to take up the bill next week. Republican Senator John Barrasso said a conference call with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and the White House was scheduled for later on Tuesday to discuss the matter.
 Asked about efforts to aid airlines, which have furloughed or laid off thousands of workers and curtailed flights as the outbreak had upended travel, Meadows said any aid "remains an open question" and that the administration is "looking closely at a number of executive actions."
 Meadows said he and Mnuchin met with Trump late on Monday and that the president tasked them "to get as creative as we can within the confines of the law to put forth as much money as we can so we can keep this economy going."

Mr Lee said Singapore has been able to deal with COVID-19 only because the public service, political leadership, businesses and the public have worked together and played their part.  
 For instance, he said officials, ministries and agencies have worked tirelessly to build new capabilities on the fly, and stepped up to do things beyond their normal scale or scope.  
 Political leaders defined priorities, made major decisions, directed civil servants to implement these decisions, won public support for the measures and took responsibility for them, he said.  
 This included whether to impose a circuit breaker, what activities to restrict, which businesses to keep open, whether to close and re-open schools.  
 “Businesses ... put their people to work furiously on solutions, often going well beyond their business mission,” Mr Lee added.  
 “They set up mask production lines, constructed Community Care Facilities, built up testing capacity, scoured the world for test equipment, test kits and reagents, and designed booths to swab patients safely and much more.”  
 Mr Lee said the overall COVID-19 response depended “critically” on Singaporeans working together and trusting the Government, adding that he was grateful for their cooperation, which will remain crucial as the fight goes on.  
 “Many Singaporeans’ lives have been severely affected, but they have borne these difficulties calmly and stoically,” he said. “Many volunteered to take part in the COVID-19 operations, sometimes on the frontline and also in community efforts to help others through these tough times.”

PEORIA -- Undeterred by the threat of COVID-19, three graduates from Dunlap High School's class of 2016 started medical school at the University of Illinois College of Medicine in mid August.
   
 David Qi and his friend Nick Xie, both 22, began classes at the Peoria campus, while Janet Pang, who is also 22, started classes at the Chicago campus.
   
 Rather than making them re-think their plans to become doctors, COVID-19 galvanized the decision.
   
 "I figured that's part of why I want to be a doctor, being able to impact society in such a way where I'm saving lives," said Qi.
   
 Pang said that while it was scary to think about the fact that some physicians have lost their lives during the pandemic, it didn't change her mind.
   
 "At the end of the day I think helping people is what we wanted to do, and helping people does, I think, come at a cost, especially during a global pandemic like this," she said.
   
 Xie said COVID didn't even make him pause.
   
 "This is the kind of thing I'm excited about," he said. "I'm considering emergency medicine, and this is the kind of situation you have to be ready for as an emergency medicine doctor because you are on the front line," he said.
   
 Things are quite a bit different for this year's M1 class. Starting medical school is a big deal, typically celebrated with a white coat ceremony, where students recite the Hippocratic Oath and receive the white coat they will wear throughout their training. But the tradition has been put on hold for the time being because of the pandemic.
   
 "Unfortunately for us that wasn't really able to happen. We will still have a white coat ceremony at some point, but I think that does take away from the entire feeling of 'we finally got accepted after years of hard work,' " said Pang. "But as far as classes are going, I think UICOM is doing a good job in trying to make most of it be as normal as possible."
   
 All lectures and discussions are being held online, a situation made easier by the fact that technology was already being used extensively in the educational process at UIC. Most lectures were already being delivered online so students could learn the material before gathering in small groups to apply what they learn, said Dr. Jessica Hanks, associate dean for academic affairs.
   
 "We underwent a curriculum transformation across the U of I system about three and a half years ago," she said. "We really looked at changing the way we deliver medical education in general. Technology was one of the means we wanted to introduce to the curriculum."
   
 Combined with the fact that a lot was learned with remote learning was implemented during the statewide shutdown in March, the new learning plan is going smoothly. And because students don't have to be on campus to complete their coursework, it's allowed for greater flexibility -- some out-of-state students have yet to move to Peoria. For Pang and Xie, a longtime couple, remote learning has allowed them some extra time together even though they are studying at different campuses. Xie spent his second week of classes in Chicago, doing his coursework while sitting in Pang's apartment.
   
 "We do have different professors, but overall the special thing about UICOM is that our curriculum on all three campuses is essentially the same. It's pretty nice having the resources of all three campuses. You can choose whichever professor you like the best and listen to that lecture," said Xie.
   
 While the flexibility of remote learning is nice, there have been some downsides. Students can't shadow doctors to learn about their specialties, and it's not great for student bonding. Community is important because students support each other through the arduous journey of medical school.
   
 "It can seem a little overwhelming at times. The pace of class is not something I've experienced before, and not what I think my classmates have experienced before -- it's like college at two to three times the speed," said Pang.
   
 Qi agreed.
   
 "They say it's like drinking from a fire hydrant, and it definitely could be that way until we figure out how to study to digest all the material," he said.
   
 After Christmas students may be able to return to in-person learning, but the final decision depends on COVID-19, said Hanks.
   
 "We are planning for them to come to campus in the spring, but we need to have a pulse on where things are on the pandemic," she said.
   
 At that point students will begin learning hands-on skills, like how to examine a patient. In the meantime, they are learning how to better communicate online through Zoom, a skill that is likely to become increasingly important with the growth of telemedicine, said Hanks.
   
 "During the pandemic telehealth has come into more prominence and will likely stay in prominence after the pandemic, so it's one of the things we are talking about with them as far as communication and working on those skills," she said.
   
 While Pang has found remote learning to be difficult in some ways, she believes it was the right choice for administrators to make.
   
 "As we've seen from other universities that have gone back to school, there's also repercussions to putting a lot of students together in smaller spaces. Remote learning may be unpleasant for social life, for building a social system, and shadowing in the hospital, but I think it was very necessary."

While digital crowdfunding is far from a new concept – “charity” wasn’t exactly invented in 2020 – it has become more popular during the pandemic. We’ve already seen it take root in the US, where the private healthcare system has forced many to turn to crowdfunding to meet basic medical bills: a third of all donations made to fundraising platform GoFundMe are for US healthcare- related costs. But people in the UK had been comparatively insulated from leaning too heavily on the crutch of crowdfunding. Until now.

CLEARFIELD — Clearfield County Commissioners announced which municipalities will be receiving federal grant funds under the CARES Act.
 The county was awarded $7.1 million in CARES (Coronavirus Aid Relief and Economic Security) Act funding from the federal government, and the county is using a portion of the money to provide grants to municipalities, businesses and non-profits to offset losses due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 But surprisingly, only 12 municipalities in the county applied for CARES funding. All 12 grant applications were approved, Commissioner Dave Glass said.
 The municipalities receiving funding are as follows: Sandy Township $202,255; DuBois City $146,897; Lawrence Township $144,768; Clearfield Borough $117,137; Morris Township, $15,000; Boggs Township $15,000; Cooper Township $9,700; Bell Township $6,700; Houtzdale Borough $2,200; Graham Township $3,711; Goshen Township $1,562; and Ramey Borough $1,295.
 For the larger municipalities, the commissioners used a formula based on the municipality’s population. For the smaller grants, the commissioners gave the municipalities everything they asked for, if it was eligible, Glass said.
 “We wanted to make it as fair across the board as possible,” Glass said.
 Sobel noted that many of the local municipalities, especially those with police departments, are facing higher costs due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 “It does please us that we are able to help our local municipalities,” Commissioner John Sobel said.
 Glass also said he was disappointed that more municipalities didn’t apply for funding.
 “You have to ask to get it,” Glass said.
 Commissioner Tony Scotto said it is possible the commissioners will have a second round of funding for municipalities, but that depends on how much money they have left after the business and non-profit grants are handed out.
 The commissioners received a total of 239 applications for grants from small businesses and 60 from non-profits.
 Due to the number of applications, the commissioners are estimating it will take them a month to six weeks to process the applications.
 “We have many, many applications,” Scotto said.
 Glass thanked county Community Development Specialist Lisa Kovalick and the staff at Clearly Ahead for their assistance in processing the grant applications.

BOZEMAN — Tom Duffy, the owner of Excel Drilling and Bozeman Hot Springs gave his life in a helicopter crash while fighting fires in Oregon on Aug. 24, 2020. He was 40 years old and died a hero. Anyone who knew Tom knew he was larger than life, both in stature (6'10") and in everything he did. When God opened a door he didn't walk, he ran.
 Tom was born and raised in Bozeman. He attended Mount Ellis Elementary, Mount Ellis Academy and then played basketball for the Bobcats at Montana State University. As a sophomore, Tom led the Big Sky Conference in blocked shots and the team in 3-point field goal percentage. He did this while missing half the conference games because, as a Seventh-day Adventist, Tom observed the Sabbath from sundown Friday until sundown Saturday. Through that entire time, he kept God by his side and let Him lead wherever he needed to go. Tom was big but God is bigger. Tom was easy to like with his big smile and infectious laugh. It was not uncommon to see Tom on the phone working through an employee's personal life issue or talking to a new friend whom he met while working on his never-ending projects. His dreams and aspirations were as big as he was.
