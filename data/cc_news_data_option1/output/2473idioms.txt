Likewise, SB808 lacks Medicaid expansion language. Lambeth expressed his confidence that Cooper would sign the bill
 SB808 would need at least 72 votes in the House to become veto proof, requiring the support of at least seven House Democrats at full attendance.
 The proposed monthly payment of $4 million would go to the four participating statewide prepaid health plans, or PHP, selected to provide capitated insurance services — Centene (operating as WellCare of N.C.), AmeriHealth Caritas N.C., Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina, and UnitedHealth Group.
 A prorated amount of $4 million would be provided monthly to any regional PHP, or up to $2 million.
 Dobson acknowledged Monday that while he “fully expects” that DHHS “will be able to go live” on July 1, 2021, “I think everyone knows the department has serious concerns with the penalty."
 DHHS could not be immediately reached for comment on the House's changes to SB808
 DHHS said in a statement prior to the amendment changes to SB808 that “managed care is a massive shift for our hospitals, clinics, providers and our more than 2 million beneficiaries.”
 “With the department and every part of our health care system responding to a global pandemic, establishing an unmovable date and imposing taxpayer-funded penalties is not appropriate during a pandemic.”
 State Sen. Ralph Hise, R-McDowell, said during the Senate floor debate that the PHPs “are losing in excess of $5 million a month” for the employees they brought online who are attempting to register individuals to select their plans.
 The payment is designed “to compensate” the PHPs for revenue they were projected to earn.
 Hise said the DHHS would provide the potential penalties from “departmental resources” that could include drawing from a surplus or adjusting fee-for- services rates.
 Medicaid currently serves 2.22 million North Carolinians, or 21% of the state’s population. That number is projected to increase to 2.28 million by mid-2021 and 2.39 million in mid-2023.
 About 1.6 million are scheduled to be enrolled in the new managed-care system under a federal waiver approved by the federal Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services in October 2018.
 Currently, providers are paid on a fee-for-service model administered by DHHS.
 By contrast, the proposed PHPs would pay health-care providers a set, or capitated, amount per month for each patient’s costs. The DHHS would reimburse the plans.

The Mattioli Foundation, in conjunction with Pocono Raceway, have established the Jimmie Johnson Legacy Scholarship for students pursuing professional skills at the Monroe Career & Technical Institute (MCTI.) This scholarship recognizes and celebrates the achievements of seven-time NASCAR Cup Series champion Jimmie Johnson. “Jimmie Johnson is a champion on and off the track,” said Nick Igdalsky, Director of the Mattioli Foundation and CEO of Pocono Raceway. “In addition to being one of the most accomplished NASCAR competitors of all time, Jimmie will go down as one of the best ambassadors our industry has had the privilege to know. Our extended Raceway family appreciates all he has done to support youth-based efforts to bring new fans into our sport, STEAM-related program for educators and students, and introducing inclusive initiatives, such as our infield playground, for those of all abilities to enjoy together. The establishment of this scholar ensures Jimmie Johnson’s legacy with live on within our community for years to come.” The Jimmie Johnson Legacy Scholarship will provide $4,800 to students at MCTI each year, for the next 23 years. This timeframe correlates to the number of seasons in which Johnson has competed in at least one NASCAR-sanctioned race. For each additional year in which Johnson compete in a NASCAR race at ‘The Tricky Triangle,’ the Mattioli Foundation and Pocono Raceway will add one additional year of support for this scholarship. Those eligible to receive portions of this scholarship include students who have demonstrated professional skills throughout their time at MCTI. Professional skills, as outlined by MCTI, teach and assess such things as attendance, work ethic, teamwork, etc. MCTI stresses these skills as a result of employers requesting to find strong, dedicated individuals for their respective organizations. “MCTI is excited and honored to be sharing the Jimmie Johnson Legacy Scholarship, afforded by the Mattioli Foundation and Pocono Raceway, to the deserving students of our school,” said Dennis Virga, Director, Monroe Career & Technical Institute. “MCTI strives to provide the high-tech career and technical training to students along with professional skills associated with their career field to ensure individuals are properly prepared to enter the workforce. Thank you!” To learn more about the Monroe Career & Technical Institute, visit www.monroecti.org. “I want to thank the Mattioli Family and Pocono Raceway,” said Jimmie Johnson, driver of the No. 48 Ally Chevrolet. “What an honor to know that the Jimmie Johnson Legacy Scholarship will be able to make a difference in the community for many years. Supporting education initiatives is important to Chani and me and is the focus of our foundation. It’s especially nice to know that this gift will help continue that mission and have an impact in the Pocono area. Thanks again to the Mattioli Foundation and track.” Pocono Raceway PR
