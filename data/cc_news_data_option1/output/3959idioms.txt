WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump arrived at the hospital Friday after he and first lady Melania Trump tested positive for COVID-19, raising fresh questions about the president's health.
   
 Trump, 74, went to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, in what aides said was a precautionary move. Officials said they expected him to be there for a few days.
   
 Trump boarded Marine One, the presidential helicopter, en route to Walter Reed, which is about 9 miles away from the White House, in his first public appearance since he tested positive for the coronavirus. Wearing a mask and a navy suit and blue tie, he gave reporters the thumbs up as he walked across the lawn but did not stop to take questions.
   
 In taped remarks before his departure, Trump tried to assure the public that he and the first lady were doing well.
   
 "I'm going to Walter Reed Hospital, I think I'm doing very well, but we're going to make sure that things work out," Trump said. "The first lady is doing very well. So thank you very much. I appreciate it."
   
 White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said the president "remains in good spirits, has mild symptoms, and has been working throughout the day."
   
 "Out of an abundance of caution, and at the recommendation of his physician and medical experts, the President will be working from the presidential offices at Walter Reed for the next few days. President Trump appreciates the outpouring of support for both he and the First Lady," she added.
   
 The president's diagnosis, which he tweeted just before 1 a.m. on Friday, sent shockwaves through Washington and across the country, causing markets to plummet just weeks before the presidential election.
   
 The president received a single 8 gram dose of Regeneron's polyclonal antibody cocktail as a precautionary measure, according to a memo from White House physician Dr. Sean Conley. The antibody cocktail is being studied in four late-stage clinical trials and its safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority, the company said on its page.
   
 The president also has been taking zinc, vitamin D, famotidine, melatonin and a daily aspirin, Conley said.
   
 "As of this afternoon, the President remains fatigued but in good spirits," Conley said, according to the memo.
   
 Conley said the first lady was experiencing only a "mild cough and headache." He added that other members of the president's family are well and tested negative for COVID-19.
   
 Trump has not posted to his Twitter account since announcing his diagnosis, an uncharacteristic move for a president who frequently tweets and retweets throughout the day.
   
 "We're having to hold him back a little here because he is hard at work," White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany told Fox News on Friday afternoon.
   
 When asked whether Trump would address the nation about his health in the coming days, McEnany said: "It's safe to say that you'll be seeing and hearing from the president as he moves forward with his working schedule."
   
 Trump revealed his test results after one of his closest advisers, Hope Hicks, who joined the president on a series of recent trips, had been infected. Hicks began feeling symptoms on a return flight from the president's rally in Minnesota on Wednesday and was isolated from other passengers on the plane.
   
 White House officials knew Hicks tested positive before Trump traveled to his golf resort in Bedminster, N.J., to attend a fundraiser Thursday, Meadows confirmed.
   
 "I can tell you in terms of Hope Hicks, we discovered that right as Marine One was taking off yesterday," Meadows said.
   
 He added that some people who had been traveling and in close contact with Hicks were removed from the flight, raising questions about why the president proceeded with the fundraiser, which saw him come in contact with dozens of supporters.
   
 Vice President Mike Pence and second lady Karen Pence both tested negative. Former Vice President Joe Biden and his wife Jill Biden announced they also tested negative after coming into contact with the president at Tuesday's first presidential debate in Cleveland, Ohio.
   
 Officials said presidents have a suite of offices at Walter Reed, and doctors recommended that Trump use it as a precaution in light of his positive COVID test.
   
 Aides insisted the president is fine, walking around and talking, and that this is a precautionary move.
   
 If the president should need a procedure and becomes incapacitated, he will temporarily cede authority to Pence.
   
 Section 3 of the 25th Amendment to the Constitution, which lays out succession should the president become incapacitated, has only been invoked three times since it was adopted in 1967.
   
 Former President Ronald Reagan invoked it when he had surgery to remove a cancerous polyp in his large intestine in 1985 and George W. Bush twice used it when he underwent routine colonoscopies.
   
 At 74, the president is five times more likely to be hospitalized and 90 times more likely to die of COVID-19 than someone between the ages of 18 and 29, according to the CDC.

Proposition 23 would require a doctor or highly trained nurse at each of the state’s 600 dialysis clinics whenever patients are being treated to improve patient care. It was placed on the ballot by unions that represent health care workers.

“There are a tremendous number of complications that can occur during and around dialysis, and a doctor onsite will be able to respond not only to emergencies such as cardiac arrest, bleeding, dangerous fluctuations in blood pressure — all other common side effects of dialysis — but they also will be able to oversee the overall quality of care,” said Steve Trossman, a spokesman for the Oakland-based Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West, which spent more than $6 million in a signature drive to get it on the ballot.

Two registered voters have complained to the local election board about unsolicited texts from a local congressional candidate. But texting is becoming an increasingly employed method for candidates to reach voters.
 Washington County Election Director Kaye Robucci said she forwarded the complaints to Maryland Del. Neil Parrott, R-Washington, since they were about texts from his campaign for the Congressional 6th District.
 Robucci said she also responded to the complainants, assuring them the phone numbers were not obtained through the election board. But Maryland law does allow people to buy other information about registered voters as long as it's not used for commercial solicitation or for other purposes not related to the electoral process, according to Robucci and the state's data application form.

“The motive is to force the dialysis community to spend a bunch of money to defeat it because ultimately this is more about a union organizing battle. I have no doubt that in 2022 there will be another initiative on the ballot targeting dialysis providers and dialysis patients,” said Kathy Fairbanks, a spokeswoman for No on Prop. 23, a coalition led by DaVita and Fresenius that also includes the California Medical Association and American Nurses Association-California.

The long-awaited opening of the capital city's Portillo's is near.
   
 Representatives from the Oak Brook-based chain, known for its Chicago-style hot dogs and Italian beef sandwiches, confirmed that the Springfield location will open in mid-November.
   
 Meghan Thornton, general manager of the Portillo's in Normal, told members of the Springfield City Council on Tuesday that "there will be a soft opening date projected soon for you all and you'll be the first to know."
   
 Council members that evening advanced the restaurant's request for a "Class E" liquor license to the consent agenda for the upcoming city council meeting on Tuesday.
   
 Work on the 7,800-square-foot restaurant, at the southwest corner of Veterans Parkway and Lindbergh Blvd., continues at breakneck speed.
   
 The restaurant will feature a 1950s and 1960s diner-themed interior that pays homage to Route 66. There will be seating for 190 people, a seasonal outdoor patio for 50 people and double drive-thru lanes.
   
 Liquor licenses
   
 The city council is expected to take action Tuesday to reduce the amount of liquor licenses due to eight businesses that have closed in recent months.
   
 Licenses held by American Harvest Eatery, Auggie's Front Burner, TGI Friday's, Springfield Charhouse, The Incubator, Westside Pub & Grill, Illinois Tap and Eastside Wine & Spirits will be canceled.
   
 J. Parkes to close
   
 J. Parkes, the Springfield boutique known for its original jewelry, clothing and home goods, will close at the end of the year.
   
 Owner Jan Parkes said she and her sister Ann are pivoting towards "artirement" after more than 32 years in business.
   
 "My sister came up with that, she said, we're calling this 'artirement.' We're not retiring, it's not retirement, it's artirement because there's no way we'll be able to not work," Parkes said. "We love it too much. When you've done it your whole life every single day, you can't stop and we don't want to."
   
 Though the brick-and-mortar store will close, Parkes said she still plans to make and sell jewelry. Details on that are to be determined later.
   
 "I'm very well aware of how fortunate I am to have been in business for 32 years in this community, and have had such great following and such great support," Parkes said. "And the only sad thing for me is I'm going to miss all the people and the connection of the customers and their faces every day.
   
 "But we're very, very fortunate to have a career that we've loved every single day," she said. "Not very many people can say that."
   
 A "store closing" sale has started, with all merchandise now 20% off in store and at www.jparkes.com.
   
 SSGA launches new campaign
