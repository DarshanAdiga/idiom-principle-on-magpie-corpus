SYDNEY, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Cricket Australia said it was still planning to host the first test against India in Adelaide next month despite moving players out of South Australia on Tuesday after a cluster of new coronavirus cases in the state.
 South Australia reimposed social distancing restrictions on Monday after detecting 21 cases of the virus, most of which were acquired locally in Adelaide.
 With neighbouring states starting to close the borders with South Australia to try to contain the outbreak, Cricket Australia shifted international players from their Twenty20 and one-day squads north to Sydney.
 India's squad is already in quarantine in Sydney preparing for six limited- overs matches against Australia in November and December followed by the four- test series, which is scheduled to start at Adelaide Oval on Dec. 17.
 Cricket Australia said in a statement it "remained committed" to playing the first test at the ground.
 "CA has taken a pro-active approach and mobilised a number of people across the country over the past 24 hours to shore up our men's domestic and international schedules," said interim chief executive Nick Hockley.
 "CA will continue to monitor the situation in South Australia and the resulting border restrictions around the country.
 "As ever, we will remain agile in addressing the challenges presented by the pandemic and remain more confident than ever of hosting a safe and successful summer across all formats."
 The Adelaide Strikers and the other South Australia-based players preparing for the Big Bash League were also moved out of the state to a training camp on the New South Wales coast ahead of the start of the domestic Twenty20 league on Dec. 10.
 South Australia was more successful than New South Wales and Victoria at containing the virus when it first arrived in Australia and hosted the first four rounds of the domestic Sheffield Shield competition from mid-October.

“The other side of social media, generally, is that the law around the incredibly broad terms of service photographers agree to for platforms is murky at best,” Burns says. “I do not encourage using Facebook/Instagram for many reasons, but for photographers, one of the strongest is that you grant far too broad a license to these companies.

Whatever it was he seemed to secure a place in Geordie hearts when he connected with Isaac Hayden's header against Man City in 2019 to set up a 2-1 win.
 That night news emerged of Miguel Almiron arriving from Atlanta United for £21million and the prospect of Rondon, Perez and the Paraguayan playmaker linking up excited the city.
 All three gelled tremendously in the second half of the season as Newcastle staved off relegation with plenty of time to spare.
 It was on March 4, Rondon told me in an exclusive with the Chronicle: "They know what I want and what my family want.
 "I have spoken with them and made it clear. If there is an opportunity for me to be here - I'll stay here 100%."
 The question was bandied around in the Press room but Rafa Benitez's future also wasn't clear.
 Despite Benitez's own situation he recommended converting Rondon's loan into a permanent deal as good business for the Magpies as they looked to stabilise in the top-flight, but Newcastle had other plans in the works, not least the £40million move for Joelinton that the ex-Real Madrid boss didn't approve at such an astronomical price.
 Rondon was at the centre of a political battle in the boardroom and the demands of his agent - well over six figures in terms of a weekly wage - were being resisted in the corridors of power at St James'.
 The awkward contract extension in place at West Brom also meant a big fee would have been needed too and in the end his cost would be revealed as ended up joining Benitez at Dalian in China for a price of around £18million.
 Yes, he ended up netting a reported £250,000 per week in China but he would have taken much less has he been offered the security at St James'.

The FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup which was set to take place between February 7 to March 21 next year was cancelled on Monday due to the novel coronavirus and now India will host the 2022 edition of the tournament, a FIFA press release said. The decision was taken on Tuesday after a meeting of all the FIFA stakeholders."Following due consideration of the situation and taking into account the input of all stakeholders the FIFA-Confederations COVID-19 Working Group has recommended that the 2020 edition of the FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup (and FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup) be cancelled and that the hosting rights for the 2022 editions be transferred to the countries that were initially planned to host the 2020 edition," the press release said.AIFF responded to the postponement and said that they will continue to make developments in the women's football in India as they plan for the U17 Women's World Cup in 2022."In light of not being able to host the tournament next year, FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup taking place in India in 2022 comes as a delightful silver lining.

Back in May, Call of the Sea _immediately stood out_ with its incredibly lush island environments and dense soundscape. We'll be off for a tropical getaway to the Pacific soon, when the game releases on December 8.
 In Call of the Sea you take the role of Norah, a woman who travels all the way to an unnamed island in the Pacific to find her explorer husband in 1934. When she gets there, she finds the wreck of a large ship, ruined and washed ashore, as well as mysterious ruins that hint at prior civilisations. One scene in the trailer also shows something or someone, presumably Norah, dive deep in the ocean with webbed hands, so there seems to be some magic involved, too.
 The first-person gameplay will involve general exploration and plenty of puzzle solving in front of beautiful backdrops. Developer Out of the Blue has also promised an "emotional character study" of Norah. A game in which a 1930s housewife turns into an Indiana Jones-type explorer sounds like a unique idea, and I'm curious to see how it works out.

The Solo Pro is the first Beats on-ear headphone to feature active noise cancellation and the first full-size Beats headphone to charge via Lightning. It uses the company's Pure Adaptive Noise Canceling (Pure ANC headphones), "derived from the over-ear Studio3 Wireless, with updated tuning to accommodate the on-ear form factor," Beats says. With a tap of a button, you can turn off that noise cancellation to save battery life or hit the button a second time to enter an audio transparency mode that allows you to hear the outside world and ambient sound, not just the music you're listening to.
 Available in multiple color options, the noise-canceling headphone is equipped with six microphones, two of which are beamforming mics designed to hone in on your voice when you're making calls or talking to your voice assistant (Apple's H1 chip is on board for always-on Siri). The sound quality is smooth and well-balanced, with punchy bass that doesn't make music sound boomy. It's comfortable for an on-ear model and it's more compact design travels better than some full-size models on this list. I just wish it cost a little less and came with a cable to plug in to in-flight entertainment systems. Alas, the Lightning-to-3.5mm is an optional accessory that costs $35, which is ridiculous.

Price trades above and below the 100/200 hour MAs but stalls at ceiling and floor.The USDCAD took the pair higher on the back of the weaker retail sales in the US today. However, the pair moved toward a swing area at 1.31157 to 1.31235, and found sellers. That area is now the close ceiling going forward. Earlier in the Asian and London morning session, the pair stalled near swing lows from yesterday near 1.3063 level. That helped to solidify the floor for trading. So the 60 pips range between 1.3063 and 1.31235 defines the trading range. In between those extremes are the 100 hour MA above at 1.31018 and the 200 hour MA below at 1.30667. The current price is now below that 100 hour MA at 1.31018 at 1.30945. Looking at crude oil, the price is down -$0.44 at $40.90. The low reached $40.57. The high was up at $41.69.

Nov 17 (Reuters) - Mobile Premier League's sports merchandise brand MPL Sports will be the new sponsor of kit for the Indian cricket team under a three-year deal until 2023, the country's cricket board (BCCI) announced on Tuesday.
 The agreement will run from this November to December 2023, replacing sportswear giant Nike whose five-year extension signed in 2016 ended this year.
 Under the partnership, MPL Sports will provide kits for the men's, women's and Under-19 Indian teams and it will also be allowed to sell licensed Team India merchandise.
 "We look forward to MPL Sports adding a new chapter to the team's kit, and bring official BCCI licensed merchandise within easy and convenient reach for the billion-plus fans who cheer for Team India," BCCI president Sourav Ganguly said in a statement.
 The association will begin this month with India's tour of Australia, where they are set to play three one-day internationals, three Twenty20 matches and four tests.
 MPL, a mobile e-sports platform, is the second fantasy league company to come on board with the BCCI after Dream 11 were chosen as the main sponsor of the Indian Premier League for its recently concluded 2020 edition. (Reporting by Rohith Nair in Bengaluru Editing by Robert Birsel)

BRATTLEBORO — Different shoes made by artist Andy Yoder for his exhibit “Overboard” are on display at the Brattleboro Museum and Arts Center through March 6.
 In an article on the BMAC web site, Yoder said he got the idea for the exhibit from “The Great Shoe Spill of 1990,” when five shipping containers fell off a freighter during a storm, dumping 61,820 Nikes into the Pacific. As the shoes washed ashore, a network of beachcombers collected and resold them. An oceanographer got word of this and collaborated with the beachcombers to create data, leading to an important study of the ocean’s currents.
 “I’m a big believer in the possibility of second chances, which is why this story has such appeal for me,” Yoder wrote. “Most of the sneakers are made from materials I pulled out of recycling bins, like a beachcomber collecting Nikes on the beach. Making art is a form of alchemy, and being creative gives us the power to steer the ship, rather than bobbing around like a sneaker lost at sea.”

“Signor Prefetto,   Le scriviamo in qualità di segretario e presidente della sezione Ladispoli del partito “Italia in Comune” per segnalare la gravità della situazione in cui versa la città di Ladispoli.   Nella nostra città, infatti, si registra il più alto numero di contagi rispetto a tutti gli altri centri del litorale. Persino più alto di quello registrato a Civitavecchia che ha una popolazione superiore ed è un importante snodo ferroviario e marittimo.   Probabilmente sarà che la nostra città, soltanto un mese fa, è assurta alle cronache perchè un consigliere comunale ha avuto la cattiva idea di presentarsi sul palco di una manifestazione nazionale di “negazionisti”, a piazza San Giovanni, indossando la fascia tricolore, invitando tutti alla disobbedienza civile rispetto alle prescrizioni finalizzate alla prevenzione del contagio e affermando di parlare a nome della città di Ladispoli.   Al riguardo, a nulla è valso ogni invito rivolto al sindaco per richiedere, almeno, una presa di distanza rispetto all’accaduto e un richiamo al consigliere.   Ebbene, poichè non esistono ragioni che giustificano il triste primato di Ladispoli riguardo alla diffusione del contagio, viene da chiedersi che non vi sia un collegamento tra il crescente incremento di casi COVID e le bravate irresponsabili di quel consigliere e di altri come lui.   Peraltro, nei giorni scorsi lo stesso sindaco ha inaugurato una manifestazione di commercianti che protestavano contro le misure restrittive, promuovendo così un assembramento di persone che non manifestavano l’attenzione richiesta ai fini della prevenzione del contagio.   Il movimento esprime grave preoccupazione per quanto è accaduto e per quanto può accadere.   Per questa ragione, signor Prefetto, Le saremmo grati se potesse invitare il sindaco al rispetto del ruolo rivestito e all'adozione degli atti conseguenti nei confronti di tutti, sia che siano semplici cittadini, sia che si tratti di consiglieri comunali della sua maggioranza.”

New season, new team, new ownership group and a new-look squad --everything about the upcoming Indian Super League (ISL) feels fresh for Mumbai City FC and their new head coach Sergio Lobera. "Yes, a lot of new things," Lobera said in a Zoom chat from Goa. "We need to work a lot because when you need to implement something new, you need more time. And we don't have time." Yet, if there's one man who knows how to make an immediate impact, it is Lobera. The Spanish coach oversaw a highly-successful FC Goa. He took charge in 2017 and guided them to the ISL semi-finals (2017-18), final (2018-19) and the 2019 Super Cup title. Lobera was sacked towards the end of last season despite Goa sitting at the top of the table due to an internal feud. The City Football Group (CFG)--it acquired a historic majority stake in Mumbai City last November--pounced on Lobera. Mumbai City have been the league's perennial underachievers, reaching the play-offs only twice. Lobera has his task cut out; he has to incorporate his FC Goa model in Mumbai City, in a bio-bubble wrapped, curtailed season in Goa without even having a regular pre-season. "It is a big challenge. The situation is constantly changing-- there are guys in quarantine, players coming out of it, some down with injuries. Maybe it's possible to work with a full squad only three-four days before the first game. It is not easy. But I embrace this not as a problem, but as a challenge. "My first season with Goa wasn't the same as the second and the third. You need time to build a team, understand what players need from me and what I need from them as a coach. But this is professional football, and we need to compete from the beginning. We don't have the luxury of time to improve, so hopefully we can improve while winning," Lobera said. Thankfully for Lobera, his brand of attacking football is in line with CFG's vision for the Mumbai franchise. And thus began hectic purchases filled with star power--the likes of Adam Le Fondre from A-League and Bartholomew Ogbeche from Kerala Blasters. Lobera too brought with him a few key players from his Goa set up--Hugo Boumous, Ahmed Jahouh, Mourtada Fall and Mandar Rao Dessai. Lobera said the first time he visited Manchester to have a meeting with CFG's top officials, he instantly knew they were on the same page in terms of the vision for the club. "That was something that had to be very clear before we started working together. As a coach it's amazing to work with this group--in terms of the support I've received it's been the best. I had been speaking every day with them as we tried to build this team. It's very important because you don't have to waste time as a coach to explain exactly what I want and what the players need to try to put in a good performance." For one of the most successful coaches in the league with three play-offs appearances to show in three seasons, not having laid his hands on the ISL trophy must feel odd. Lobera hopes to change that, for himself and for Mumbai City. "My dream is to win the trophy. Our entire Mumbai City family wants that. But we need to focus on things that can make it possible. And hopefully, if we work hard every day, at the end of the season we can do it," he said.

 VANCOUVER/TORONTO, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Cross-examination of Canadian border officials involved in the arrest of Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou two years ago will continue in a British Columbia courtroom on Tuesday, as her lawyers seek to get her extradition to the United States thrown out.
 Meng, 48, was arrested in December 2018 at Vancouver International Airport by Canadian police, on a warrant from the United States. She is facing charges of bank fraud for allegedly misleading HSBC about Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's business dealings in Iran, causing the bank to break U.S. sanctions.
 Meng has said she is innocent and is fighting the extradition from under house arrest in Vancouver, where she owns a home in one of Canada's most expensive neighborhoods.
 Her lawyers have alleged that abuses of process took place during her initial investigation by the Canadian border officials and arrest by the police in the airport, which violated her civil rights, arguing that should invalidate her extradition.
 On Monday defense attorney Richard Peck said that Ben Chang, a Canadian police officer who allegedly gave identifying details about Meng's electronic devices to the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, had declined to testify. Peck called the move "concerning" and warned of "any number of consequences from his refusal to testify."
 Canada Border Services Agency officer Sanjit Dhillon will continue testifying on Tuesday, as prosecutors wrap up their questions and defense lawyers take the floor.
 Huawei said in a statement Monday that the hearings had revealed "important information" about Meng's arrest. It said the company continues to have "great confidence in both Meng's innocence and the integrity of the Canadian judicial system."
 Meng's arrest has soured diplomatic relations between Ottawa and Beijing. Soon after her detention, China arrested Canadian citizens Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig on espionage charges.
 Meng's case is set to wrap up in April 2021, although the potential for appeals by either side mean the case could drag on for years.
