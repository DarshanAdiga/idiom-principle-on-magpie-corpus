Ryan Mendez was throwing smoke, and try as they might, the Salina Falcons simply didn't have an answer.
   
 Mendez, who will pitch this fall for hometown Nebraska-Omaha, struck out 13 batters and allowed just three hits over six shutout innings Thursday night as Millard North pulled away late for a 14-0 victory over the Falcons at Dean Evans Stadium.
   
 It was the Kansas Grand Slam Tournament opener for both teams.
   
 "I felt most of my pitches were working," said Mendez, who only gave up doubles to Salina's Noland Puckett in the second inning and Connor Anglin in the fourth, plus a single to Loren Vincent in the fifth. "I threw a lot of fastballs tonight, but the slider is my go-to pitch.
   
 "I got in a groove out there and once I did I felt like I was in control. It's important for me to get in a rhythm."
   
 Falcons starter Josh Weiser kept his team in the game early with four solid innings, allowing just two runs on two hits -- one was the first of two home runs by Millard North catcher Zachary Johnson -- while striking out six batters and walking three. But the defending 18-under division champions tacked on two runs in both the fifth and sixth innings, then blew it open with an eight-run seventh.
   
 "The first four innings we battled tough and we had a couple of guys bet their barrel on the ball," Falcons coach Luke Curry said. "Weiser gave us an outstanding start and (reliever Evan) Vaughn came in and did what he had to do, which was pound the strike zone.
   
 "They just hit the ball hard."
   
 Mendez struck out each Falcon but Jason Duong at least once and did not walk a batter. He did not come out for the bottom of the seventh after Millard North sent 13 batters to the plate in the top half, leaving cleanup duties to Tommy Roland.
   
 Millard North had seven of its 10 hits in the seventh inning, including a two- run homer to left by Johnson, but it was Mendez who dominated on the mound.
   
 "As the game went on, he just got better and better," Curry said. "Early on he was throwing the fastball, then he started mixing in the slider.
   
 "He just got in a rhythm."
   
 Millard North is back in action with its second Pool A game at 10 a.m. Friday against the Hays Eagles at Evans Stadium. The Falcons face Hays at 2:30 p.m. at James Matson Field, then wrap up pool play at 7 p.m. against the Kansas Senators at Dean Evans.

Board member Glenn Kack updated on the Western Mental Health meeting held recently via zoom. Client numbers are down but the organization is still operating successfully. The Granite Falls and Redwood Falls offices have had one employee working to date, with a second support staff member starting work onsite as well this week. The Canby office will open in mid-July for one day a week. If the governor's order is permitted to expire on July 13, all telehealth remote services will be discontinued and clients will have to seek assistance in person. Some face to face meetings are already occurring in Marshall. A handful of remaining organization employees not yet back to work are hoped to be back by fall.

The eye-catching Long-billed Curlew is North America's largest shorebird, but it is very often found away from the shore.
 The birds' lengthy bills, longest in females, has engendered some interesting folk names such as "sicklebird," "old smoker," and "candlestick bird."
 Candlestick Point and Candlestick Park stadium in San Francisco were both named after the Long-billed Curlew, the "candlestick bird," which was once numerous in the region and still winters, although in smaller numbers.
 Curlew Lake in South Dakota and Curlew Valley in North Dakota are just a few of the places in the bird’s Curlew's breeding range named after this avian stand-out.
 The Long-billed Curlew breeds on the wide grasslands of the Great Plains and Great Basin of the western United States and southwestern Canada. It's one of the earliest breeding shorebirds, returning from wintering grounds by mid- March. Adults leave breeding areas by mid-July, with the young following in mid-August. This species is a short- to medium-distance migrant, moving south in flocks to winter along the U.S. West Coast, south into Mexico, Guatemala, and Honduras. Small numbers winter in Florida and along the southeastern Atlantic shore.
 A male Long-billed Curlew stakes out a breeding territory and attracts a mate through noisy flight displays, ascending to about 30 feet on rapid wingbeats, then slowly descending in circles while whistling an onomatopoeic "curl-e-e- u-u." Another commonly heard Long-billed Curlew vocalization is a call often given when a bird is alarmed, a sharp "whit-whit, whit, whit, whit, whit."
 Once mated, a male curlew fashions a nest scrape, or several. He may scratch out a few, but the female chooses one final site, lining her chosen nesting place with twigs, grasses, and leaves. The scrape is often placed next to an object, such as a rock, a shrub, or even a cow dropping.
 Both parents incubate the eggs, of which there are most commonly four. Adult Long-billed Curlews may defend their eggs and young by feigning injury to lead away potential predators. Adults will also chase and attack intruders, including Swainson's and Ferruginous Hawks, ravens, crows, coyotes, and people.
 Downy young curlews leave the nest soon after hatching. At first, both parents tend the growing chicks, but after a few weeks, the female usually leaves the brood to the male and is the first to head south for the wintering grounds.
 Like many shorebirds, the Long-billed Curlew often feeds in small flocks, particularly during migration and in winter. This bird's extremely long, down- curved bill is perfectly adapted for probing after deep-burrowing prey such as earthworms, mollusks, and crabs, their chief food during the winter. During the summer, this species searches the ground and low foliage for insects such as grasshoppers, beetles, and butterflies. Its unmatched bill also comes in handy for reaching down wolf spider burrows. Curlews may even prey upon the eggs and young of smaller nesting birds such as the Horned Lark.
 Once nearly wiped out by market hunting (with the sparse East Coast-wintering population yet to recover), the principal threat to the Long-billed Curlew is now habitat loss. Agricultural fields and housing developments have replaced many native grasslands, while non-native, invasive plants make some remaining habitat unsuitable for curlew nesting.

Scientific morality focuses instead upon matters like reducing wars, poverty, disease, and global warming. The religious scriptures say nothing about those — the actually most important matters — but instead claim that holy people will cure the sick, and that God will take care of the rest (so, it’s _laissez faire_ ). Furthermore, at the extreme, people of faith — regardless of whether it’s in secular ‘authorities’ such as Marx or Plato, or in ‘prophets’ who are alleged to have transmitted some supernatural deity’s words — have been willing to perpetrate ‘holy wars’ or Crusades and thus have been encouraged by their interpretation of ‘authorities’ to invade foreign lands (like during the Crusades and 9/11) in the advancement of their faith (which may be nationalistic, but is always taken solely upon the _epistemological basis_ of faith, regardless of whether or not it is religious). Science rejects all ‘authority’, all faith, and relies instead only upon rigorously analyzed empirical evidence. Conquering foreign lands in order to spread the religion or the nation or the ‘race’, is no part of that. “Spreading the faith” is no part of any science, though some people who try to be scientific get lost because they become focused more on spreading their beliefs than on discovering more realities, which might disprove _what_ they believe. Any faith is obsessed with the content of belief, not with the process of discovery.

The royals love to ski and frequently travel to do so. In 2013, Kate Middleton, Prince William, and Prince Harry stayed at the Arosa ski resort in the Swiss Alps to attend a wedding. Kate was pregnant with Prince George at the time, so she didn't ski, but the royal brothers got some slope time in. Despite the current world situation, Arosa is up and running right now.
