 Few economists could have predicted last fall that the globe would come to a virtual standstill within months as governments closed their borders, imposed lockdowns and ordered other measures to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus, triggering a sharp drop in business activity worldwide.
 The prize comes with a cash award of 10 million kronor — about $1.1 million — and a gold medal.
 Last Monday, the Nobel Committee awarded the prize for physiology and medicine for discovering the liver-ravaging hepatitis C virus. Tuesday’s prize for physics honored breakthroughs in understanding the mysteries of cosmic black holes, and the chemistry prize Wednesday went to scientists behind a powerful gene-editing tool.

But a growing conservative legal movement has questioned the Chevron decision. Several conservative justices have expressed some support for limiting agencies’ discretion. If a future Supreme Court were to limit the Chevron ruling, it would mark a big change in the law that would potentially make it harder to sustain governmental regulations.

And now the story: India is in a very tight space with government revenues and the room to spend our way out of this crisis is very limited. India is not a hard currency country that can print its way out, the way that the US or the UK is doing. The small amount of monetization of the debt, or printing of currency, should not be used up in the beginning, but should be saved for maximum bang for the buck, especially when the avenues to spend are limited with the lockdown not fully lifted. How do you get people who can afford to spend to spend? The way out has been to try and nudge the sections of the population in government and organized sector white-collar jobs to spend. The rising stock markets, the over-subscribed IPOs, the swelling FD coffers, the payback of debts are all pointing to one part of India being flush with funds as salaries either remained stable or were not cut that much. With reduced spending, savings have gone up for a section of Indians and the FM is trying to get this part of the population to spend.

 At times, it seemed like the season would never get underway because nobody could come to an agreement, but eventually things fell into place.
 Section VII officials deserve a lot of credit for facilitating discussions between schools and finding a way to come together and put regular season schedules together for various sports.
 As we head into the new week, soccer and cross country are both in full swing.
 Swimming and gymnastics should see competition begin fairly soon.
 The games and meets we have seen so far have been entertaining and enjoyable for student-athletes, coaches and their supporters.
 Seeing athletes competing in various sports wearing masks has certainly been odd, but this is 2020.
 This is the year to embrace odd.

“Space Mountain” è un ottovolante a tema spaziale al coperto situato presso Tomorrowland che ha debuttato nel parco a tema di Disneyland ad Anaheim, in California, il 27 maggio 1977, è stato il secondo ottovolante costruito a Disneyland, ed è stata la seconda delle cinque versioni di Space Mountain costruite dalla Walt Disney Company. La sua facciata esterna è una delle quattro strutture “di montagna” di Disneyland che fungono da punti di riferimento del parco. Walt Disney originariamente concepì l’idea di montagne russe a tema spaziale per Disneyland in seguito al successo del Matterhorn Bobsleds, inaugurato nel 1959. Tuttavia, una serie di fattori tra cui la mancanza di spazio disponibile, la morte di Walt Disney e l’attenzione dell’azienda Disney su la costruzione di quello che sarebbe diventato il Walt Disney World portò al rinvio del progetto alla fine degli anni ’60. Dopo il successo iniziale del parco Magic Kingdom a Walt Disney World, Disney ha rilanciato il progetto Space Mountain e ha aperto la prima Space Mountain al Magic Kingdom nel 1975. Poco dopo, Disney ha iniziato a progettare di costruire una versione più piccola di Space Mountain a Disneyland, e ha aperto la Space Mountain di Disneyland nel 1977. Il design della Space Mountain di Disneyland è stato replicato a Tokyo Disneyland nel 1983 e Hong Kong Disneyland nel 2005. La versione più recente nota come _Star Wars Hiper Space Mountain_ isale al 2017 e si trova presso Disneyland Paris.

 Bridewell Palace was then leased to the French ambassador in London before eventually being turned into a refuge for the city's poor in 1553.
 Within three years the building that housed a king had been carved up into a prison, a hospital and workrooms.
 This combo proved so successful they were rolled out across the country, and they were called Bridewells.
 The prison was populated by vagrants and so-called 'disorderly women'.

A ceasefire between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region was failing to hold Monday as the two Caucasus rivals exchanged new fire while international mediators were to relaunch efforts for a sustained truce.
 Armenia and Azerbaijan have for the last two weeks engaged in bitter fighting over Nagorno-Karabakh, a breakaway region of Azerbaijan controlled by Armenians after a 1990s war and whose independence is recognised by no other state.
 The clashes, the worst since a 1994 ceasefire, have sparked fears of a regional conflict with Turkey backing Azerbaijan, Armenia seeking to pull ex- Soviet ally Russia in on its side and Iran looking on warily.
 After 11 hours of talks between the Armenian and Azerbaijani foreign ministers in Moscow, the two sides agreed early Saturday to a humanitarian ceasefire.
 \- Thumping echoes of shelling -
 But repeated clashes have so far made a mockery of the truce deal.
 An AFP correspondent in the Azerbaijani town of Barda not far from the front line heard thumping echoes of shelling Monday morning.
 In Karabakh's main city of Stepanakert, an AFP photographer heard the sounds of shelling from the direction of the town of Hadrut.
 "Armenian armed forces, which did not comply with the humanitarian truce, repeatedly tried to attack the positions of the Azerbaijan army," the Azerbaijani defence ministry said.
 It said it had destroyed a "large number of enemy forces" as well as one T-72 tank and three Grad multiple rocket launchers.
 Armenian defence ministry spokeswoman Shushan Stepanyan said for her part that Azerbaijan was "now intensively shelling the southern front".
 Armenia claimed that "the adversary suffered great losses of manpower and military equipment" but did not provide further details.
 The 1990s war -- which ended with the 1994 ceasefire that did not present a long-term solution to the conflict -- resulted in the deaths of about 30,000 people.
 Nearly 500 people including more than 60 civilians, have been killed in the latest fighting since last month, according to a tally based on tolls given by both sides.
 The ceasefire negotiated in Moscow had agreed to pause hostilities to exchange prisoners and the bodies of people killed, with Azerbaijani officials insisting it was only going to be a temporary measure that would not halt its campaign.
 \- 'Continued military activities' -
 Analysts have long warned that Nagorno-Karabakh was the most combustible of the frozen conflicts left over after the fall of the Soviet Union, with Azerbaijan vowing to regain control of the territory and Armenians insisting they would never cede ground.
 The EU's diplomatic chief Josep Borrell said on Sunday he was concerned by "reports of continued military activities, including against civilian targets, as well as civilian casualties" in violation of the ceasefire.
 The so far fruitless decades-long search for a settlement over Karabakh has been overseen by the Minsk Group of world and regional powers chaired by France, Russia and the United States.
 Armenian Foreign Minister Zohrab Mnatsakanyan was in Moscow on Monday for a visit including meetings with the Minsk Group co-chairs as well as Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.
 Lavrov lamented at the start of the talks that the ceasefire "was not being fully observed" with fighting continuing. He expressed hope that talks with both sides would allow "the full implementation" of the agreements made in Moscow last week.
 Renewed fighting has stoked fears of a full-blown war embroiling Turkey, which strongly backs Azerbaijan and has been accused by Paris and Moscow of sending pro-Ankara Syrian militiamen to help Baku.
 Russia, meanwhile, has a military base in Armenia and counts Yerevan as an ally in the Moscow-led Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO).
 However the Kremlin has kept its distance from Armenian encouragement to become involved, saying that the CSTO treaty does not extend to Karabakh.
 Iran, which has warm relations with Armenia and is wary of Baku's military cooperation with Israel, has also expressed alarm over the reports of Syrian militia being sent to Azerbaijan.
 In a statement, the Iranian foreign ministry expressed regret "over the violation of the announced ceasefire", urging both sides to resume talks.

 CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- The jig may be up for an "asteroid" that's expected to get nabbed by Earth's gravity and become a mini moon next month.
 Instead of a cosmic rock, the newly discovered object appears to be an old rocket from a failed moon-landing mission 54 years ago that's finally making its way back home, according to NASA's leading asteroid expert. Observations should help nail its identity.
 "I'm pretty jazzed about this," Paul Chodas told The Associated Press. "It's been a hobby of mine to find one of these and draw such a link, and I've been doing it for decades now."
 Chodas speculates that asteroid 2020 SO, as it is formally known, is actually the Centaur upper rocket stage that successfully propelled NASA's Surveyor 2 lander to the moon in 1966 before it was discarded. The lander ended up crashing into the moon after one of its thrusters failed to ignite on the way there. The rocket, meanwhile, swept past the moon and into orbit around the sun as intended junk, never to be seen again -- until perhaps now.
 A telescope in Hawaii last month discovered the mystery object heading our way while doing a search intended to protect our planet from doomsday rocks. The object promptly was added to the International Astronomical Union's Minor Planet Center's tally of asteroids and comets found in our solar system, just 5,000 shy of the 1 million mark.
 The object is estimated to be roughly 26 feet (8 meters) based on its brightness. That's in the ballpark of the old Centaur, which would be less than 32 feet (10 meters) long including its engine nozzle and 10 feet (3 meters) in diameter.
 What caught Chodas' attention is that its near-circular orbit around the sun is quite similar to Earth's -- unusual for an asteroid.
 "Flag number one," said Chodas, who is director of the Center for Near-Earth Object Studies at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California.
 Sometimes it's the other way around.
 A mystery object in 1991, for example, was determined by Chodas and others to be a regular asteroid rather than debris, even though its orbit around the sun resembled Earth's.
 Even more exciting, Chodas in 2002 found what he believes was the leftover Saturn V third stage from 1969′s Apollo 12, the second moon landing by NASA astronauts. He acknowledges the evidence was circumstantial, given the object's chaotic one-year orbit around Earth. It never was designated as an asteroid, and left Earth's orbit in 2003.
 The latest object's route is direct and much more stable, bolstering his theory.
 "I could be wrong on this. I don't want to appear overly confident," Chodas said. "But it's the first time, in my view, that all the pieces fit together with an actual known launch."
 And he's happy to note that it's a mission that he followed in 1966, as a teenager in Canada.
 Asteroid hunter Carrie Nugent of Olin College of Engineering in Needham, Massachusetts, said Chodas' conclusion is "a good one" based on solid evidence. She's the author of the 2017 book "Asteroid Hunters."
 "Some more data would be useful so we can know for sure," she said in an email. "Asteroid hunters from around the world will continue to watch this object to get that data. I'm excited to see how this develops!"
 The Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics' Jonathan McDowell noted there have been "many, many embarrassing incidents of objects in deep orbit ... getting provisional asteroid designations for a few days before it was realized they were artificial."
 It's seldom clear-cut.
 Last year, a British amateur astronomer, Nick Howes, announced that an asteroid in solar orbit was likely the abandoned lunar module from NASA's Apollo 10, a rehearsal for the Apollo 11 moon landing. While this object is likely artificial, Chodas and others are skeptical of the connection.
 Skepticism is good, Howes wrote in an email. "It hopefully will lead to more observations when it's next in our neck of the woods" in the late 2030s.
 Chodas' latest target of interest was passed by Earth in their respective laps around the sun in 1984 and 2002. But it was too dim to see from 5 million miles (8 million kilometers) away, he said.
 He predicts the object will spend about four months circling Earth once it's captured in mid-November, before shooting back out into its own orbit around the sun next March.
 Chodas doubts the object will slam into Earth -- "at least not this time around."
 The object is also in the same plane as Earth, not tilted above or below, another red flag. Asteroids usually zip by at odd angles. Lastly, it's approaching Earth at 1,500 mph (2,400 kph), slow by asteroid standards.
 As the object gets closer, astronomers should be able to better chart its orbit and determine how much it's pushed around by the radiation and thermal effects of sunlight. If it's an old Centaur -- essentially a light empty can -- it will move differently than a heavy space rock less susceptible to outside forces.
 That's how astronomers normally differentiate between asteroids and space junk like abandoned rocket parts, since both appear merely as moving dots in the sky. There likely are dozens of fake asteroids out there, but their motions are too imprecise or jumbled to confirm their artificial identity, said Chodas.

Game 6 was over by halftime, the Lakers taking a 64-36 lead into the break. The Heat never led and couldn’t shoot from anywhere: 35% from 2-point range in the half, 33% from 3-point range and even an uncharacteristic 42% from the line, not like any of it really mattered. The Lakers were getting everything they wanted and then some, outscoring Miami 36-16 in the second quarter and doing all that with James making just one shot in the period.

She said district officials are “pleased” by staff and students’ efforts at handling safety measures during the pandemic and will address failures to comply on an individual basis. The district allowed up to a quarter of students back to school buildings in mid-September, and about 20% returned; all staff are required to be in buildings full time.

Abdullah said in an interview that he saw promise for good relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan and although small steps had been made, they would have a big impact. “We had good discussions, extensive discussions with authorities, civilian and military, and in most of the cases for example on the need for reduction in violence, the need for getting to ceasefire, on the need for showing flexibility … we are on the same page.” He said he was leaving Pakistan with a positive image of the country and that he had no doubt that peace in Afghanistan would lead to peace in Pakistan, and ultimately the region. “As neighbours we have no other choice but to work together" and both sides “address each other’s legitimate concerns and work on the basis of common interest, mutual interest the better it will be,” he was quoted as saying.
 Afghanistan's neighbours and the international community have reached a consensus that peaceful settlement of the Afghanistan issue is the only solution for peace in the region. In this regard, major steps were taken in the year 2020.
 It should be noted that India is the only country in the world that wants to prolong and scuttle the peace process as it is losing space in Northern Alliance. Understandably, anyone including India who opposes peace and dialogue efforts is not sincere to Afghanistan.
 Talking about the peace deal with Taliban that is facing several hurdles, Abdullah said that both parties, the Afghan government and Taliban, decided to initiate talks after nearly three decades of fighting. “Through war, there are no winners and through inclusive peace, there are no losers,” he was quoted as saying: “Personally, I would have preferred it to move in a more speedy manner.” The Afghan leader said that the people were looking forward to results — a decrease in violence and reaching an agreement of ceasefire.
 It is a universal truth that regions grow though interconnectivity. In future, regional connectivity between Pakistan and Afghanistan will lead to prosperity of both countries. Pakistan wants Afghans to benefit from economic connectivity through CPEC, which has great potential. As a landlocked, terrorism and militancy prone nation, Afghanistan is in desperate need of infrastructural development and uplifting of its economy. Thus, by joining CPEC, an ideal environment of trilateral cooperation can be developed in the region, which can benefit all parties involved. Afghanistan can particularly gain enormously by not only benefiting from this Chinese investment but also can have an active role of both China and its strategic partner Pakistan in bringing stability and peace in the war-torn country.
 CPEC is predicted to bring industrialization and investment to Pakistan, the carry-over effects of which will obviously benefit the neighboring Afghanistan also.
 Pakistan is pivot to peace and stability in Afghanistan, as it has suffered the most due to 40 years of active conflict in neighboring Afghanistan. Pakistan hosts about 3 million Afghan refugees and economic migrants, who have fled 40 years of violence in their war-torn country.
 Pakistan believes in people-to-people contacts, mutual trade, economic and transit integration with Afghanistan. In this regard, Abdullah appreciated the recently approved visa policy for Afghanistan which he termed a good development on that front.
 The new visa policy will make it easy for Afghan citizens to acquire multiple entry visit visas, including those for long-term business, as well as investment and student visas. A new category of health visa also has been enacted to enable Afghan patients to receive visas on arrival at the border. It is expected the new visa and trade-related steps will help expand bilateral economic ties and address concerns often raised by Afghan traders, students and Afghan refugees living in Pakistan. Prime Minister Imran Khan also approved the opening of 12 trade markets near the Afghan border to provide livelihood opportunities to poverty-stricken populations in and around the remote region.
 There is a need to reduce the mistrust between both countries. Irritants in bilateral relationship have to be ignored to build a constructive relationship. Abdullah Abdullah's visit was successful on all counts; the rocky road to better bilateral ties must be followed by both countries.

“Under the influence of a high-pressure area formed over Central Asia, dry continental air would blow towards Karachi and it would result in causing extremely hot and dry conditions in Karachi,” said PMD Chief Meteorological Officer Sardar Sarfraz.
 Hot and dry conditions resulted in a sharp rise in the temperature in Karachi on Sunday when the mercury soared to 38.5 degrees Celsius in the city and sea breeze largely remained cut off. Sardar Sarfraz said October was usually a hot month in Karachi as sea breeze remained cut off due to a transition from summer to the winter season.

Student-athletes have been given the opportunity to compete in the sports they love and be with their teammates working together.
 When the New York State Public High School Athletic Association decided to allow each of its individual 11 sections to choose whether or not to hold a fall sports season, it created a lot of controversy.
 Each section had to make the call whether or not to have sports, and Section VII was no different.
 If anything, this entire situation showed how tough and complicated the decision-making processes for sections can be.
 At the end of the day, Section VII decided to host a fall sports season, but each of its member schools was able to decide on their own about whether or not they wanted to allow their student-athletes to compete.
 It's nearly a 50-50 split in terms of local teams that opted into this season, and regardless of what each school district decided to do, the nice thing was schools had the opportunity to make the decision that they felt was best for their local communities.
 For the school districts that opted out, they will have an opportunity for the "Fall II" season NYSPHSAA has installed to take place beginning in March.
 But for the school districts that opted in, their student-athletes are participating in sports and making the most of it.
 From our standpoint at the Press-Republican, covering all the developments as this fall season was being put into place was messy to say the least.
