LEWISTON — The Lady Lancers are back on top in Section VI.
 No. 1 seed Lewiston-Porter girls soccer built up a 2-0 halftime lead before closing things out with a 3-2 win over No. 3 Williamsville South (9-5-1) in the Class A-2 championship game Saturday at Lewiston-Porter High School. The Lady Lancers wrap the 2020 season at 12-2-1, winning their first sectional title since splitting co-champion honors with Williamsville East in 2018.
 Lew-Port head coach Norm Forney preached patience to his girls, knowing the Billies' offense would run through Ashley Krzyznowski and eighth-grader Ava Plezia as they played around the box. Forney's assumptions were spot on, as Krzyznowski nearly brought South back with two second-half goals.

West Virginia offensive line and assistant head coach Matt Moore was on the Big 12 Conference coaches call on Monday in place of head coach Neal Brown, who was unavailable.


  The Mountaineers are entering their first bye week after a run of five games in five weeks that represented the longest such stretch of any team in the Big 12.


  Perhaps no positional group had a more grueling stretch than the offensive and defensive lines, so Moore’s perspective on the status of the team’s offensive front and its prospects moving forward was a welcome one.


  On Monday, Moore discussed tight ends, tackles and the increased role of redshirt freshman tackle Parker Moorer during the team’s 24-6 win over TCU on Saturday. Moorer saw significant time, specifically in the second half, at right tackle in place of John Hughes and Briason Mays, both of whom are dealing with injury woes.


  “He has been improving tremendously,” Moore said of Moorer. “He’s been getting better, getting better and getting more comfortable at his position. I just felt like this week he was ready and with John Hughes being dinged up and not at full speed, he got a chance to step in there in the second half and played really well. He had a couple of knock-downs and played with a lot of passion and played really hard.


  “He really came out of his shell and showed what he can be, so I’m really excited about him down the road and continuing to improve as the season goes on.”


  The WVU offensive line is anchored by senior interior linemen Michael Brown and Chase Behrndt. Hughes is a junior, but outside of those three, the rest of the players seeing significant time along the line are sophomores and freshmen.


  That now includes Moorer, starting interior lineman Zach Frazier and starting left tackle Brandon Yates, who are all freshmen.


  “It’s really exciting to see some of the youth we have at [tackle], but also, with our recruiting class we have coming in, we’re going to get even better at that position,” Moore said.

Vehicle stops have never been recorded or reported externally, even though – in contrast to stop and account – it is a criminal offence not to comply. Nor does any reason need to be given for the decision to pull a vehicle over. Many of the vehicle stops that we observed could be justified for Road Traffic Act reasons or as a result of intelligence, but some were stopped for less clear reasons. Late at night, officers regularly stopped vehicles for no other reason than that they wanted to know who was out and about; a sporty model, or a car with young men on board, would arouse particular attention. It is easy to see how certain groups can become targets for repeated stops that may in turn escalate to a stop search.

 A two-time All-Western New Yorker, NFL player of the year and a soon-to-be four-time first team All-NFL pick, Weir was ecstatic about the win and scoring in her final varsity game, but she was even more thankful to even have this opportunity this fall.
 Now that her NW soccer career is behind her, Weir was able to reflect on donning the black and red.
 "My Wheatfield team, we're not just a team, we're a family," Weir said. "We're with each other on and off the field, we're very supportive and encouraging of each other. And I think that goes a long way. Without the endless encouragement and support from players and our coach, the job wouldn't have gotten done today.
 Weir added: " ... I couldn't have asked for a better senior year with an NFL win, with a sectional win. I'm kind of bummed that it can't go any further, but a win is a win and we'll take it to end on a win."

BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (WBRC) - We’re probably not going to see lines of people wrapping around buildings to take advantage of those Black Friday deals this year.But a different Black Friday doesn’t necessarily mean a slow one.Spending in Alabama last year during November and December reached an all-time high at $13.25 billion, and analysts say this year’s holiday sales will be unchanged or could even grow.Alabama retailers say these past several months of the pandemic have prepared them to get creative this holiday shopping season.That means offering more curbside pickup, updating their inventory online, and keeping shoppers engaged on social media.And with less people spending money on holiday vacations, the Alabama Retail Association said it’s important shoppers spend that money locally, which means retailers are stepping up their online game.“They are sharing on a daily basis products on their social media, through email blasts, through all the ways that they’ve been communicating with their customers all along,” said Nancy Dennis with ARA. "But they’ve set that up so that customers know-- yes, you can get this if you want to order matching pajamas. You don’t have to do that Amazon. You can get them from our store.

SAVANNAH, Ga. (WTOC/AP) - Roughly 2,500 ballots that were not counted in one Georgia county have been found during the statewide hand-count audit.According to the Secretary of State’s Office, the ballots were discovered in Floyd County in northwest Georgia.Nearly 5 million votes were cast in the presidential election in Georgia, and Democrat Joe Biden had been leading Republican President Donald Trump by about 14,000 votes.The Associated Press reports the Floyd County election board chairman said he didn’t have an immediate breakdown of the newly discovered ballots, but unofficial results previously reported showed Trump with 70% of the county’s votes to 28.4% for Biden.“The reason you do an audit is to find this kind of thing,” said Gabriel Sterling, who oversaw the implementation of the new statewide election system for the secretary of state’s office.Sterling said this appears to be an isolated problem and that there are “no fundamental changes” in other counties.The Associated Press reports county election board Chairman Tom Rees said it appears the roughly 2,500 ballots were cast during in-person early voting, but election officials weren’t sure how they were missed.According to the Associated Press report, the county elections office suffered several setbacks, including a top official being infected by the coronavirus, and it seems proper procedures weren’t followed when the results were tabulated by machine, Sterling said. But the county had the paper ballots and caught the problem during the hand tally, he said.The Secretary of State is calling for the Floyd County elections supervisor to resign.Copyright 2020 WTOC and the ASSOCIATED PRESS.

HONG KONG (AP) — Hong Kong authorities will inspect 2,500 older residential buildings after a deadly fire killed seven people in what an elected official said may have been an unlicensed restaurant operating in an apartment. The fire and building departments will aim to complete the review by year-end, a government news release said Monday evening. The inspection will cover buildings at least 60 years old and include those that are part- residential, part-commercial. “In light of the risks exposed by this fire accident, I have asked the (fire services and building departments) to further step up inspections to eliminate serious fire safety threats to safeguard people’s lives and property,” Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said. The Sunday night fire killed seven people and injured 11 others. Ten people remain hospitalized, seven in critical condition, the news release said. The dead and injured range in age from 8 to 48 years old. The apartment where the fire started may have been operating as an unlicensed restaurant, according to the area’s district council member, Leslie Chan. He said the victims were from the city's Nepalese community. Hong Kong media reports said people in the restaurant were celebrating Diwali, a major Hindu festival, as well as a birthday. Candles set soundproofing materials on fire, according to the reports. Many Nepalese live in the area and work in Hong Kong’s finance, retail and security businesses. The building, which is in the Yau Ma Tei neighborhood in Kowloon, lacked a sprinkler system and people were trapped in the back of the kitchen, Fire Services Department officer Cheung Kwong-yuen said. Hong Kong media said the fire was the deadliest since a 2011 blaze that killed nine people. The fire highlights lingering safety issues in...

Asian stocks cautiously pushed further into record territory on Tuesday, and oil edged higher after US benchmarks were pepped up by news of another promising coronavirus vaccine. Investor sentiment was given a boost when Moderna Inc said its experimental Covid-19 vaccine was 94.5% effective in preventing infection based on interim late-state data.The Cambridge, Massachusetts-based firm became the second drugmaker, after Pfizer Inc, to announce promising trial data in the development of a vaccine to defeat the pandemic. Its shares gained 9.6% on the day.MSCI's broadest index of Asia- Pacific shares outside Japan gained 0.11% on Tuesday morning, a day after hitting its highest level since launching in 1987. The MSCI World Index of global shares which also hit a record high on Monday, ticked higher still in Asia's morning trading. "Investors are looking further ahead in the pandemic development into 2021, instead of focusing on the very challenging outbreak that's taking place in the US and Europe now," said Tai Hui, chief Asia market strategist, J.P. Morgan Asset Management, in emailed comments. Hong Kong benchmark rose 0.1% and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.23%, after Monday's trading had been severely curtailed by a software glitchJapan's Nikkei 225 fell 0.2% after hitting a 29 year high the day before. All three main Wall Street indexes advanced on Monday, led by cyclical and small cap names, with the Dow Jones Industrials Average setting a record as it neared the 30,000 mark for the first time in nine months. "This is a continuation of what we saw last week as the vaccine being a catalyst for a rotation into cyclical sectors such as energy, financials, and defense with expectations for renewed demand and travel," said Thomas Hayes, managing member at Great Hill Capital in New York.The same sentiment helped oil prices hold onto Monday's gains. US crude on Tuesday morning was at $41.36 per barrel little changed after rising 3.02% on Monday and Brent rose 0.3% after an earlier rise of 2.43%. In currency markets, China's central bank on Tuesday lifted its official yuan midpoint to the highest in nearly 29 months, underpinned by solid gains in spot prices a day earlier on the back of strong economic data.The positive news helped the risk friendly Australian dollar, which rose to a one week high against the dollar, but rising case numbers in the United States meant the dollar was broadly flat against the safe haven yen. US Treasury yields rose on Monday and the yield curve steepened in the wake of the vaccine developments. The yield on Benchmark 10-year notes was last at 0.9012%, from 0.893% late on Friday.

WASHINGTON — Pinned six years in the minority, Democrats have an uphill but real shot at wresting Senate control in January, with more opportunities in 2022. Yet as states increasingly sort themselves along hardening partisan lines, it’s complicating Democrats’ drive to win the majority and keep it.


  Thanks to this month’s elections, Democrats will own all four Senate seats from purple Arizona and increasingly blue Colorado next year. If they can win January runoffs for both seats from Georgia, which has recently teetered toward them, they’ll command the Senate thanks to Vice President-elect Kamala Harris’ tie-breaking vote in what would be a 50-50 chamber.


  Yet even as Democrats have made those gains and others since surrendering control in the 2014 elections, they’ve lost foundations of their old majority that will be hard to recapture. Gone are seats from Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, both Dakotas, Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Missouri, North Carolina and West Virginia, all of which tilt Republican in presidential elections.


  In addition, three current Senate Democrats are from states that President Donald Trump carried easily this month despite losing to Democrat Joe Biden. Sens. Joe Manchin, 73, of West Virginia, Jon Tester, 64, of Montana and Sherrod Brown, 68, of Ohio are all proven brand names in states that would be hard for Democrats to hold without them.


  All this means a constricted playing field for Democrats to add seats in coming election cycles. The same is true for Republicans, but it’s on Democrats to gain ground and keep it if they want to control a Senate that, with the Democratic-led House, could make Biden’s legislative agenda more ambitious.


  “The Democratic caucus for a long time was built on winning races in red states” where they’ve since lost, said Matt House, a former Senate Democratic leadership aide. “The problem is a Democratic Senate majority runs through red states, and that is an inherent structural difficulty.”


  Nothing is set in stone in politics, where momentum and issues can shift abruptly. Besides Georgia, Democrats hope to grab Senate seats soon in purple North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, plus Texas as that state’s Hispanic population grows. GOP Sens. Richard Burr of North Carolina and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania have said they won’t seek reelection in 2022.


  “A few years ago, people would have laughed at the idea of two Democratic senators from Arizona,” said Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., former head of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, the party’s Senate campaign arm. He said Biden’s message of bringing people together will be a “potential strength in some of these states” for Democratic candidates.


  Even so, recent elections underscore how states have formed into solid partisan columns as voters’ ticket-splitting becomes increasingly rare.


  Setting Georgia’s January elections aside, in every state but six, both senators will be from the same party next year. A seventh, Vermont, is represented by a Democrat and independent Bernie Sanders, who is aligned with them.


  In addition, every state represented by two senators from the same party was carried by that party’s presidential candidate this year, Biden or Trump.


  That pattern of partisan allegiance largely persists into the future. In the 2022 elections, Democrats will defend Senate 13 seats — all from states Biden won. Trump won 18 of the 21 seats Republicans will protect. Biden won two others, and The Associated Press hasn’t yet called the presidential winner in Georgia.


  “We can win all across the country” in 2022, said Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., who will lead the National Republican Senatorial Committee beginning next year. He added that without Trump on the ballot to draw GOP voters, “We’ll have to really hustle.”


  Part of Democrats’ challenge in Senate elections is their voters tend to concentrate in coastal states. Republicans often rely on that as a campaign theme, accusing Democrats of catering to liberal coastal elites.

"There will be something to announce from the meeting," a Japanese Foreign Ministry official told a media briefing, without elaborating.
 A pact, which has taken six years to negotiate and would need to be ratified by lawmakers, would be the first such agreement for Japan since it signed a status of forces agreement in 1960 that allowed the United States to base warships, fighter jets and thousands of troops in and around Japan as part of a military alliance that Washington describes as the bedrock of regional security.
 In a call with Suga on Thursday, President-elect Joe Biden said his incoming administration was committed to maintaining that close partnership.
 Tokyo and Canberra are seeking closer ties as they worry about Chinese activity in the region, including militarization in the South China Sea, maneuvers around the disputed Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea, and Beijing's growing sway over Pacific island nations further east.
 "It's helpful for other nations to take a more active role in military activities and operations in the region, not least as the Americans are overstretched," said Grant Newsham, a research fellow at the Japan Forum for Strategic Studies.
 To counter China, Suga last month visited Vietnam and Indonesia to bolster ties with key Southeast Asian allies. That followed a meeting in Tokyo of foreign ministers from the "Quad" an informal group of Japan, Australia, the United States and India.
 China, which insists its intentions in the Asia-Pacific region are peaceful, described the Quad, as a "mini-NATO" aimed at containing it.
 While Japan sees India as more hesitant to deepen ties, it has pushed for greater defense cooperation with Australia since a 2007 joint statement on cooperation.
 In 2013, Japan and Australia also agreed to share military supplies, which was broadened in 2017 to include munitions.
 Although Japan renounced the right to wage war after World War II, its Self- Defense Forces are one of Asia's biggest and most modern militaries, with stealth fighters, helicopter carriers, submarines and recently formed amphibious units that the U.S. Marine Corp helped train.
 Australia, too, is a significant regional military power, with a carrier-borne amphibious force it can dispatch on overseas missions.
 "A closer security arrangement is on the cards in Tokyo in a bid to mitigate the risks of a more adventurous China,” said John Blaxland, a former intelligence officer who’s now a professor at the Australian National University. "There is a clear overlap of interests when it comes to managing maritime security, but Australia will still be mindful it may be seen as leading attempts to gang up against Beijing.”
 Morrison told reporters last week that he viewed the Quad as "very important.” Underscoring the gravity of the trip, he will visit Suga in person even though pandemic protocols mean he will need to self-isolate for two weeks on his return.
 The Chinese government will view the meeting with "cautious eyes and slight nervousness,” said Yoshikazu Kato, an adjunct professor at the Asia Global Institute at the University of Hong Kong. The renewed impetus of the Quad since 2017, when it was revived in a bid to create a buffer against Beijing, is a symbol that democracies are willing to become "unprecedentedly united in their stance to contain China — it’s of the utmost concern” to Beijing, he said.
 In recent years, Australia has ramped up diplomatic lobbying to strengthen alliances with other democracies, a strategy that paid off earlier this month when it was invited for the first time by India to participate in the Malabar naval exercises along with other Quad members.
 Still, Australia’s move to take a leading role in the Quad, along with other multilateral groupings such as the Five Eyes intelligence sharing alliance, may lead to further punishment from Beijing that could exacerbate its reputation as China’s new whipping boy.
 While tensions had been growing for years, Australia tipped its relationship with its largest trading partner to a new nadir in April by leading international calls for independent investigators to enter Wuhan to probe the origin of the coronavirus.
 China’s pride was bruised and since then, crippling tariffs have been placed to Australia’s barley exports, and traders have been ordered to stop buying Australian commodities including coal, copper and wine.
 Earlier this month, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said bilateral relations had deteriorated after Australia launched 106 trade investigations on Chinese goods, compared with four from the Chinese side, while Australia had refused to approve 10 inbound investment deals on "unfounded national security concerns.”
 Morrison’s conservative government has rejected Beijing’s trade reprisals as "economic coercion,” even as it laments a breakdown in relations that’s put ministerial contact on ice.
 "It’s extremely important that the three key democracies in the region — Japan, Australia and India, from one side of the Indo-Pacific to the other — are coming together around shared values and keeping vital maritime trade routes thriving,” said Paul Maddison, a former commander of the Royal Canadian Navy who also served as that nation’s high commissioner in Canberra. "It sends a signal to China that just because it has the largest economic strength, it can’t shape the region in whatever way that it wishes.”
 While Beijing’s trade attacks against Morrison’s government are "scary stuff, instead of shrinking Australia is trying to help build a world-view that’s in contrast of President Xi Jinping’s,” said Maddison, who’s now the Canberra- based director of the University of New South Wales Defence Research Institute.
 That’s become more important under the "America First” doctrine on President Donald Trump; while President-Elect Joe Biden is expected to give more importance to traditional alliances, realistically he will need to place most of his government’s focus on repairing domestic divisions and economic damage caused by the pandemic.
 Such concerns about the U.S. also resonate in Tokyo, where tensions around the Senkakus, which are also claimed by China, which calls them the Diaoyu, have worsened in recent months, sparking frequent diplomatic protests.
 Democracies in the Indo-Pacific "can engage China only if we are united,” Nobukatsu Kanehara, a professor at Doshisha University in Kyoto who is a former deputy secretary-general of Japan’s National Security Secretariat, said in an interview. The Quad provides the opportunity for strategic stability, and without it all nations apart from the U.S. may have to "surrender to China — they are now too big for anybody.”

Then, the media attempted to hide two more important stories – firstly, the pay for play Joe and Hunter Biden effected by their acceptance of large sums of money from America’s main competitor, China, and money from a Russian oligarch, all denied by Joe Biden lies and proven beyond a reasonable doubt by emails and other documentation from one of the business partners, a reputable former Navy officer named Tony Bobulinski; secondly, the refusal of the mainstream media to cover the apparent and large election mischief that has left the election result up in the air, yet the media has anointed itself to _“call”_ the election and name Biden as _“President-elect”_ when there is no new president until the States certify their results and the Electoral College meets to vote.

Given the limited quantity, securing a PS5 order on Amazon in the UK, Italy, and Spain is not a guarantee. Still, it could very well be the best bet some people have come launch day. Getting a PS5 in general has proven a difficult task across the board. This especially holds true when considering the sheer number of scalpers who are buying multiple consoles at once, then hawking them online well above the market price.


  Sony released PlayStation 5 late last week in North America and Japan. The new console arrives in Europe, the Middle East, South America, Asia, and South Africa on November 19th. Fans in Malaysia and the Philippines can expect Sony’s new hardware to land in December, while an Indonesian launch is scheduled for early 2021.


  If you haven’t picked up a PS5 yet and are still on the fence about trying to preorder, you can read our full review of the console as well as our analysis of whether or not it’s worth it to get the new system right away.

Purple is the most restrictive, especially for education. Schools in the Widespread (purple) tier aren’t permitted to reopen for in-person instruction unless they receive a waiver from local health departments for TK-6 grades. Schools can reopen for in-person instruction once their county has been in the red tier for at least two weeks. If a county regresses back to the purple tier, schools won't be forced to close again, but any that hadn't open would be prevented from opening until the county clocks at least two weeks in the red tier.

Barcelona are rumoured to be considering a shock January loan move for Chelsea defender Antonio Rudiger if they miss out on Manchester City’s Eric Garcia.
 La Blaugrana have been heavily linked with a swoop for their former academy player Garcia, after he signalled his intention not to remain at the Etihad Stadium beyond next summer.
 However, Pep Guardiola has insisted he wants to keep hold of the teenage Spanish international until the end of their hectic campaign.
 If City do rebuff their efforts to secure a deal for Garica, reports from Diario AS claim German centre back Rudiger could be a short term option.
 The former AS Roma defender has slipped down the pecking order at Stamford Bridge in 2020/21 with no Premier League appearances so far for Frank Lampard’s team.
 Rudiger could be open to a temporary move away from England to reignite his career, with a loan also adhering to the Barcelona board’s efforts to tighten up their transfer spending in 2021.
 Gerard Pique and Clement Lenglet will remain as Ronald Koeman’s first choice centre back pairing, but with continued injury doubts over Samuel Umititi, Rudiger would offer an experienced alternative at the Camp Nou.

When asked whether the department was going to shift tactics in light of the region’s purple-tier status, he said, “the Chief is consulting with our city leaders and other law enforcement leaders in the region to determine how to assist the County Health Department so that we can all work together to reduce the spread of the virus.”
 The San Diego Sheriff’s Department reported issuing 146 citations — 133 in April, five in May, one in June, five in July, and two in August.
 Enforcement of health orders will remain the same for sheriff’s deputies across the county, according to sheriff’s Lt. Ricardo Lopez.
 Deputies are still focused on education first, Lopez said. Typically, deputies refer cases of non-compliance to the county’s “safe reopening compliance teams,” or work hand-in-hand with those teams, which are made up of non-law enforcement personnel.

A gunman who killed a good Samaritan who stopped to help what he thought was a disabled motorist on a San Diego freeway was sentenced Monday to life in prison without parole.
 Edson Acuna, convicted in February of first-degree murder, got more than 25 additional years tacked on, for other crimes committed during and after a vehicle break-in at a Mount Hope home went awry in October 2018.
 The break-in devolved into a shootout between Acuna and the owner of the vehicle. Acuna, his brother and two friends fled in a car, but it was disabled with two flat tires about two miles down the road.
 As they were stopped on the shoulder of Interstate 15 in Logan Heights, they mistakenly believed the man who had pulled over behind them — Navy Sailor Curtis Adams — was the same person who had been shooting at them earlier, according Acuna’s attorney.

Thirteen Riverside Village properties with delinquent taxes were taken to a tax sale last week, with some being bid on by third parties and some being transferred to the North Augusta Forfeited Land Commission.
 North Augusta City Administrator Jim Clifford gave an update to City Council on the delinquent properties ahead of the regularly scheduled meeting Monday evening.
 County taxes were paid on the properties but the city’s Municipal Improvement District fees and penalties were not.
 Six of the properties were sold to the highest bidder, including the parcel where the stadium parking deck is built. The highest bidder paid $60,000 for that property.
 Five small parcels, which Clifford referred to as “smaller home plots” were sold to a variety of private bidders.
 From the sale of the parking deck property plus the smaller parcels, the city collected $77,000. The bidders were not disclosed.
 The remaining seven properties have an outstanding balance of $880,418.63, according to Clifford’s presentation. They were designated to go to the North Augusta Forfeited Land Commission.
 “Those properties are still owned by the original owners and they have one full year to redeem those properties, understanding that now in addition to the MID payments that are owned along with penalties, there’s now a 3% penalty, if you will, on top of that, which is good for the first 90 days, then it bumps up to 6%, then 9%, then 12%," Clifford said.
 If the properties that were transferred to the FLC aren't redeemed within a year, the commission will then retain control.
 “If a property is held by the Forfeited Land Commission, at the end of the one-year redemption period, it is disposed of pursuant to the procedures established by the Commission,” Clifford's presentation says.
 The properties are largely owned by Greenstone.
 Clifford said the city had a “number of discussions” with people at Greenstone and made sure they were aware of the timelines and rules.
 “As long as Greenstone and their partners pay on any timeline between now and a year from the tax sale, they’d be able to redeem those properties,” Clifford said.
 Such is the case for all 13 properties – if the owner does not pay the delinquent taxes and interest, ownership will transfer to the bidder or to the Forfeited Land Commission.

Cardano is at the point of no return, and the bullish pattern is supported both technically and fundamentally. According to on-chain metrics, ADA/USD is likely to face subtle resistance between $0.11 and $0.114. Cardano is on the verge of a significant breakout, following a period of consolidation above the critical support at $0.1. A breakout is in the offing, especially now that ADA has broken above a symmetrical triangle pattern. Cardano's bulls swing back into action The smart contract token is trading at $0.105 at the time of writing. Support at $0.1 played a crucial role in the ongoing breakout above the symmetrical triangle pattern on the 4-hour chart. With the upper trendline resistance in the rearview, the least resistance path appears to be the upside. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index adds credibility to the bullish momentum after creating a near oversold reading, followed by a higher low. On the upside, resistance is anticipated at $0.11 and the recently achieved monthly high of $0.114. Once these two hurdles are behind the token, the journey to $0.123 would be relatively smooth. ADA/USD 4-hour chart Cardano is also trading above the 50 Simple Moving Average in the same 4-hour range. Closing the day above this price level would add credence to the bullish outlook. On the downside, support is expected to continue holding the ground at the 200 SMA. Other key levels likely to aid ADA in the mission to achieve new monthly highs are $0.102, the 100 SMA and $0.1. ADA/USD 4-hour chart According to the IOMAP model by IntoTheBlock, Cardano faces subtle resistance ahead, with the most notable running from $0.11 to $0.114. Here, roughly 6,000 addresses are holding approximately 1.8 billion ADA. Trading above this zone might elevate ADA to the symmetrical triangle target at $0.132. On the downside, the model reveals robust support between $0.102 and $0.104. Here, about 28,000 addresses had previously purchased nearly 5.9 billion ADA. It is doubtful that ADA will slice through this buyer congestion zone if a reversal comes into the picture. Cardano IOMAP model It is worth noting that the bullish outlook will be invalidated if Cardano fails to close the day above the 50 SMA in the 4-hour timeframe. On the other hand, support envisaged at the 200 SMA and 100 SMA must remain intact for buyers to focus on achieving a new monthly high. The fall may be devastating if Cardano overshoots the primary support at $0.1, hence the possibility of revisiting $0.09.
