"Vendo mas ginebra en Australia que en Leon", afirma Enrique Pena, due√±o de Vanagandr Destilerias SL, una micropyme de Cambre que el a√±o pasado facturo en el mercado exterior mas de la mitad de su cifra de negocio. "Ahora es una locura", a√±ade en referencia a la convulsion economica por el coronavirus. Precisamente las restricciones del Covid marcaron ayer la jornada de apertura de la VII edicion de Exporpymes, la feria de exportacion de la Camara de Comercio de A Coru√±a que por primera vez se celebra en formato virtual. A falta del ya tradicional cara a cara en Expocoru√±a, este a√±o el evento pone en contacto a traves de una web a 80 empresas gallegas y 50 importadores de 30 paises y cuatro continentes, con el afan de seguir impulsando las exportaciones en tiempos del Covid.
 Jorge Millan, director comercial de Orballo, salia ayer con buen sabor de boca de su videoconferencia con un exportador de Peru, al que le expuso el proyecto de esta peque√±a empresa en expansion dedicada al cultivo, transformacion y comercializacion de productos ecologicos desde el concello coru√±es de Paderne, especializada en plantas aromaticas, medicinales y te. A traves de esta feria virtual contacto tambien con un importador marroqui, aunque sus dificultades de conexion obligaron a posponer la entrevista. "Es extra√±o, a mi me gusta mucho mas el cara a cara porque es mas facil explicar, mostrar el producto y dar a probar", reconoce Millan, a la vez que valora que la feria se haya adaptado a las circunstancias.
 Con buena imagen e "infusiones que saben" y que invitan al "placer", explica Millan, Orballo puede presumir de seguir creciendo en tiempos convulsos, aunque abrirse camino en el mercado exterior se ha vuelto mas complicado. "Por ahora la exportacion tiene un peso muy peque√±o para nosotros, el unico pais donde estamos es Mexico. Habiamos firmado ya un acuerdo con Filipinas, pero se ha parado con el Covid. Ahora la gente es mas reacia a introducir productos nuevos", explica el director comercial de esta empresa coru√±esa con una decena de empleados en plantilla que cuenta con la primera plantacion de te certificado ecologico en Europa, en Paderne.
 Desde Cambre, Enrique Pena saca adelante su destileria de ginebra sin mas ayuda que el apoyo familiar esporadico. Con su empuje, en cinco a√±os ha conseguido colocar este producto _gourmet_ en Estados Unidos -su principal mercado-, Panama, Mexico, Australia, Holanda, Dinamarca y Suiza. Esta en negociaciones con un distribuidor europeo para que Vanagandr llegue ademas a Alemania, Austria y Polonia. Ayer, gracias a Exporpymes, hablo con un importador de Turquia y otro de China.
 "La feria te permite establecer el primer contacto, luego enviaremos muestras para que conozcan el producto", explica Pena. Vanagandr se vende como una "ginebra London Dry destilada en alambique de cobre siguiendo la experiencia artesanal del destilado en Galicia" y cuenta ademas con una etiqueta del ilustrador coru√±es David Pintor. Desde lo local y sin grandes inversiones, esta ginebra de Cambre se codea con marcas internacionales. "Vanagandr comparte estanteria con ginebras de grandes multinacionales", comenta su creador, orgulloso de haber conseguido "posicionarse" despues de montar su proyecto "desde cero". Con un mercado nacional "hipersaturado", dice, este empresario coru√±es ha encontrado en la exportacion su via de crecimiento. Aunque su principal canal de distribucion son las tiendas _gourmet_ , el cierre del ocio nocturno y las restricciones de la hosteleria le estan haciendo da√±o. "El cierre del a√±o va a ser muy complicado", lamenta.
 Aceites Abril, la bodega Paco & Lola, las algas de Porto-Mui√±os, Leche Rio, pinturas Teais o la carnica Torre de Nu√±ez son algunas de las 80 firmas que participan hasta hoy en Exporpymes, entre las que predomina el sector alimentario. Del lado de los importadores, participan por primera vez Mauritania, Mozambique, Ghana o Rusia en una lista que supera los 30 mercados internacionales y que abre oportunidades de negocio a peque√±os empresarios coru√±eses en plena pandemia.

The traditional ringing of the bells in front of red kettles will be a little quieter around the region this year, as the Salvation Army prepares for a holiday season with high demand.
 The Framingham Salvation Army has been busy, working with other agencies to deliver food to those in need, said Major Wendy Kountz, commanding officer at the Framingham Salvation Army. But despite that need, she says the Framingham chapter is skipping a long tradition.
 Kountz said she has made the decision not to put out any red kettles this Christmas and is requesting mail donations and online donations.
 "Safety is the most important thing," she said. "We also want to make sure families aren't going without, so we just put the necessary precautions in place."
    Framingham's emergency food hotline fills key gap in COVID-19 assistance: delivery  
 With some chapters making decisions like Kountz, and other factors, the Salvation Army will have fewer red kettles and that will directly impact the number of donations it receives.
 "We're anticipating the red kettle donations to go down by about 50%," she said. "Last year in Massachusetts, we raised about $2.5 million," said Heather MacFarlane, Salvation Army Massachusetts Communications Director.
 If a chapter does decide to have bell ringers, the Salvation Army has to negotiate with the individual landlords and stores to determine if it is safe to do so.
 Patricia James, public relations manager for the Salvation Army of Northern New England, an umbrella organization for the state chapters, said the kettles will be out this year across the country, with new rules in place.
 Bell ringers will wear masks; will stand 6 feet away from the kettle and will move even farther back when someone approaches to donate. The kettles will be sanitized in between shifts.
 Even without the threat of COVID-19, she worries about the future of the kettles as a fundraising tool because of the increasingly cashless society.
 "I can't say I blame them," James said of people who don't carry cash. "I do the same thing."

 The kettles have been around for 130 years, according to James, starting in San Francisco in 1890. Every year prior to COVID-19, the Salvation Army raised about $126 million nationwide through the kettles, with 82 cents of every dollar going to local needs, James said.
 To make up the loss, the Salvation Army has requested that people donate on a monthly recurring basis at salvationarmyma.org/rescuechristmas.
 "Our ability to raise vital funds to serve those in need this Christmas and beyond is at risk," Commissioner Kenneth G. Hodder, national commander of The Salvation Army said, as reported by the Providence Journal. "We need everyone who has the capacity to come alongside us and ensure that the holiday season is bright for millions. We're asking you to help rescue Christmas with us by providing support in any way you can."
 An increasing need
 The Salvation Army is expecting to see a 156% increase in the amount of Massachusetts residents requesting assistance this holiday season, according to MacFarlane.
 As the pandemic continues, Kountz said she anticipates drive-in distributions to continue for the foreseeable future.
 The Framingham chapter has also had to adjust their operations and the number of volunteers they bring in.
 "It's going to be quieter this year because we aren't going to have all our locations that we have before," she said. "So for instance, for our Thanksgiving distribution, normally we have families come into the building, pick up their turkeys, pick up their foodbox and leave, but this year we are doing a drive-in distribution where it will be outside under the tent. It will be the same thing when we are giving toys to keep everybody safe. Safety is the number one thing."

Smooth batters, finely crushed ice, frothy smoothies and good grated cheese (our torture test) were all easy to achieve. A reasonable price tag means you won't have to break the bank to get a good blender.
 More powerful than the Ninja and Oster models below, NutriBullet gets the job done quickly. The 64-ounce blending jar is plenty big enough for most recipes. The blender comes with a handy recipe book and a tamper to make sure all your ingredients contact the blades. It's also dishwasher safe and comes with a one-year warranty. NutriBullet easily takes the top spot as the best blender in our blender model battle.
