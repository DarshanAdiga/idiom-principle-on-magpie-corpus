Schmeiser denied intentionally using the U.S. company's herbicide-resistant Roundup Ready seeds, saying they could have blown over from a neighbour's farm or passing trucks.


  The Supreme Court of Canada eventually ruled that Schmeiser infringed on Monsanto's patent, although he did not have to pay the damages.


  "It's fictionalized in the sense of the relationships of the movie, between Percy and his wife, Louise; it's fictionalized in the farming community," Johnson said in a recent phone interview.


  "What's not fictionalized is what we see as the truth of the story -- that Percy Schmeiser was working in this field ... and a neighbour drives by with some seeds that blow on his land."


  Some in the agriculture industry have criticized the "Percy" trailer on social media, saying it contains inaccuracies, including its depiction of Schmeiser as innocent.


  Johnson calls such arguments "fair."


  "That's what movies are for, is to get a debate and a conversation going," said the Emmy Award-nominated director of "The Shield" series, whose other credits include "The Good Fight," "The Walking Dead" and "Homeland." He is also an actor, with credits including "The Wire" and "Homicide: Life on the Street."


  "If you want to take the position that he knew all along and he did it on purpose, take that position, that's fine."


  But the filmmakers didn't "put words in Monsanto's mouth," and Johnson doesn't think Schmeiser would risk everything he owns "to make up this lie," he added.

It's been a lackluster year at cinemas, to say the least. Movie theaters have sat empty during spikes in the COVID-19 pandemic. Movie houses in the two biggest markets in the U.S., New York City and Los Angeles, remain closed as those cities fight to keep infection numbers under control. Over the summer, Hollywood looked to Christopher Nolan's highly-anticipated _Tenet_ as a savior of the moviegoing experience, but when the film finally premiered after numerous delays, it trickled out to little fanfare. (It has managed to bring in $300 million, mostly from overseas, though that box office total falls far short of the rest of Nolan's films.) Still, theater owners have been pinning their hopes on a resurgence in moviegoing this fall.

BATON ROUGE, La. (WAFB) - Our local level of concern continues to grow today as it relates to Hurricane Delta. Rapid intensification has continued through the overnight and this morning, with Delta becoming a major hurricane as of 10 a.m. as sustained winds soared to 115 mph. Just after that advisory was issued, the Hurricane Hunters found even higher winds of 130 mph, making Delta a Category 4 hurricane. Additionally, forecast guidance and the official forecast track imply a significant threat to southeast Louisiana.Enhanced infrared (IR) satellite loop as of Tuesday morning showing Hurricane Delta in the western Caribbean headed toward the Gulf of Mexico.Delta will track west-northwest into tomorrow morning, likely reaching the northern Yucatan Peninsula and areas near Cancun as a very dangerous hurricane. The official forecast shows Category 4 intensity at a potential Yucatan landfall, with Category 5 intensity not out of the question.Some land interaction with the northern Yucatan Peninsula may result in a bit of weakening from Wednesday into early Thursday, but the official forecast shows Delta regaining Category 4 intensity over the southern Gulf of Mexico. A turn to the north should begin by late Thursday as Delta rounds a ridge of high pressure to its east and feels the influence of a developing trough over Texas. A continued northward motion is expected on Friday while at the same time wind shear may begin to result in some weakening of the storm. The biggest lingering question right now is how much weakening? The official forecast from the National Hurricane Center still seems to imply a Category 2 landfall in Louisiana as of the 10 a.m. advisory.Forecast rainfall from NOAA’s Weather Prediction Center over the next 5 days. Average rain totals of 3” to 5” are expected, with locally higher amounts likely.With that in mind, everyone in southeast Louisiana should be preparing for potential hurricane impacts. The fairly quick forward motion of Delta should limit the rainfall a bit, but localized flooding will still be possible. Wind impacts could be widespread on the current forecast track, with the greatest impacts closest to the coast. And storm surge will obviously be a concern along the coast and into Lakes Pontchartrain and Maurepas. With landfall still nearly four days away, it is still a little too soon to get into specific impacts.Track the Tropics in real-time with Doppler radar in the First Alert Hurricane Center&nbsp;+&nbsp;Download the First Alert Weather appProbabilities of sustained tropical storm force winds as of the 10 a.m. Tuesday advisory for Hurricane Delta.We can say that if the forecast holds, tropical storm force winds are likely to impact most of our area, with hurricane force gusts possible.

Unfortunately, that means Disney doesn't have much flexibility when it comes to releasing the superhero movies it currently has in the can. In all likelihood, the plot of _Black Widow_ somehow ties in to future movies like _Eternals_ or even Disney+ MCU TV series like _Falcon and the Winter Soldier_. If Disney were to release any of the movies or shows out of order, it would spoil the entire story. Delays for _Black Widow_ and _The Eternals_ mean that _Doctor Strange: Multiverse of Madness_ , _Shang-Chi_ _and the Legend of the Ten Rings_ and _Spider-Man 3_ will inevitably need to be pushed back as well. That delay also means we likely won't get to see the X-Men or Fantastic Four characters--whom Marvel Studios acquired when Disney bought 20th Century Fox last year--in any MCU movie for a long time.

"C'est un texte difficile, important, qui ne veut pas opposer economie et ecologie", selon le ministre de l'Agriculture, Julien Denormandie. "La question est celle de notre souverainete."


  ## Retropedalage


  En raison de la proliferation d'un puceron vert vecteur de la maladie qui affaiblit les plantes dans de nombreuses regions, les betteraves issues de semences non enrobees d'insecticide sont atteintes de "jaunisse".


  La reintroduction de semences enrobees avec des neonicotinoides doit permettre de proteger les rendements sucriers. Le hic est que ce type de pesticide, repute tueurs d'abeilles, a ete interdit en 2018. Et voila le gouvernement oblige de retro-pedaler, en s'appuyant sur le reglement europeen sur les phytosanitaires permettant de deroger a l'interdiction, potentiellement jusqu'en 2023.


  De LFI au RN, "on est tous contre" ces insecticides tueurs d'abeilles, a convenu le ministre Julien Denormandie. Mais "aujourd'hui il n'existe pas d'alternative" chimique ou agronomique suffisamment efficace, a releve M. Denormandie.


  La baisse des rendements induite menace la perennite de la filiere sucriere française, qui emploie 46 000 personnes, dont une bonne partie dans des usines de transformation, estime la profession.  Or, pour le gouvernement, "tuer une filiere française pour importer des sucres polonais, allemands ou belges", n'est pas une option.


  On est bien embete avec votre texte


  "On est bien embete avec votre texte", a releve Thierry Benoit (UDI). "La France n'a pas la maturite d'organiser la transition ecologique (...) J'aimerais que Mme Pompili qui nous a vendu l'idee (de l'interdiction des neonicotinoides) il y a quatre ans soit au banc de l'Assemblee aujourd'hui", a-t-il deplore.


  "Il ne faut pas etre dans le dogme et faire en sorte que la France reste un grand pays agriculteur", a souligne Christian Jacob, chef de file des deputes LR qui soutiennent le texte du gouvernement.


  A l'inverse, la gauche a presente un front uni contre la mesure. Le patron du groupe LFI Jean-Luc Melenchon a defendu en vain une motion de rejet prealable du projet de loi, jugeant qu'"une faute va se commettre" et promettant une action devant la Cour de justice de la Republique.


  "Nous allons decider quelque chose de dangereux pour nos semblables, pour nos enfants, nos petits-enfants" et demain d'autres derogations seront demandees, a-t-il pronostique, en estimant en outre que "la betterave française est malade du libre-echange" davantage que des pucerons.


  Depute PS de Meurthe-et-Moselle, Dominique Potier a reclame un plan B pour la filiere betterave "pour une transition economique, sociale et ecologique".


  Emmene par l'ex-ministre de l'Environnement, Delphine Batho, le groupe Ecologie Democratie et Solidarite (EDS) a fustige la "regression" et le "renoncement" de la position gouvernementale.

JOHANNESBURG - Jaco Visagie, Rabz Maxwane, Burger Odendaal and EW Viljoen will all make their first appearances for the Lions when they travel to Durban to face the Sharks in the first match of the Super Rugby Unlocked competition on Friday evening.


  The foursome joined the Lions in July during lockdown and have all been in action in the warm-up matches in September.


  The men from Johannesburg also welcome back eight players who were part of the Springbok Showdown in Cape Town last weekend, including captain Elton Jantjies, Carlu Sadie, Marvin Orie and Vincent Tshituka.


  Ahead of the season opener, Lions coach Ivan van Rooyen said the team was hungry to compete again.


  "We are confident that the last 2 or 3 weeks really went well, the players understand what we want to achieve and how we want to get there. Its just a massive opportunity for us to be back after 6 or 7 months and we are looking forward to it," he said.


  With a good mixture of experienced players and a number of youngsters coming through the ranks, Van Rooyen hoped that this was the start of a new era for the team.


  "We've got an opportunity to start our own story and write our own history, so for us as a team we are committed to move forward together in all facets and get close as a group. At the end of the day we have to do the talking on the field and that's where the most excitement is," he said.


  Before the Super Rugby season was cancelled, the Sharks were on top of the table and Van Rooyen is under no illusions about the task that lies ahead.


  "They have a great forward pack, they can dominate physically and put a lot of pressure on you defensively, so they are a quality side and we will show them that respect. But at the same time, it's game one for everyone and we see it as an opportunity to start fresh," he said.

Two teachers were also quarantined after they ventured 1 mile down the road to New York state. One of them went apple picking.


  The county was only listed as yellow for four days, but the quarantines were strictly enforced for 14 days. Then, last Tuesday, the county was listed as yellow again. Vermont is now updating its map every Tuesday.


  Despite the yellow zone, residents on both sides of the border were still allowed to cross for "essential" travel, including going to school, work or grocery stores. But sports teams, after-school lessons and apple-picking do not count as essential.

There is no certainty that LSU-Missouri will be played in Missouri, but, if it happens, it would be LSU's first trip to Columbia in school history.


  The teams have only played twice, once before in conference play. LSU beat Missouri 42-7 in Tiger Stadium in 2016, and Missouri beat LSU 20-15 in the 1978 Liberty Bowl.


  A shift in homefield advantage isn't as large a factor this year. Every SEC team has decreased their stadium capacities significantly to fall in line with local health and safety guidelines. Missouri's Faurot Field's capacity is estimated to be in the range of 20% to 25%.


  LSU's football season has already been shortened to a 10-game, league-only campaign due to the coronavirus pandemic, and the program had to delay the beginning of its June workouts because of Tropical Storm Cristobal.

The goal for the Jordan football team this fall is to focus on the task at hand.


  No looking ahead. No looking back.


  “Our goal each year is to be determined to become the best version of ourselves,” said second-year Hubmen Coach Ozzie Sand. “We talk about being 1-0 each week. Especially this year, we have to focus on what we can do to get better each day as we prepare for an opponent.


  “With this, we expect to gain experience and knowledge that will allow us to be successful when it comes time for section play,” Sand continued.


  Sand was Jordan’s interim head coach last fall, shedding that tag after a 7-3 season. The Hubmen fell 31-20 to Marshall in the Section 2AAAA semifinals.


  It was the program’s first season in Class 4. Jordan made the state field in Class 3A in 2018, along with qualifying in 2012.


  Sand said the strength of this year’s team will be the defense. Seven players are back who played significant minutes last fall, including senior Eric Downs, who was all-district as a linebacker.


  Seniors Fletcher Kahn, JoJo Kloeppel and Ian Hennen also return at linebacker, while senior Kade Noyes and juniors Ashton Sivilay and Owen Montreuil return to the secondary.


  Sand there will be a rotation of players on the defensive line with junior Apollo Ferrozzo part of the mix.


  “Returning many key players has allowed (the defense) to have a fast start during camp, which has been key with the limited practice time compared to a typical season,” Sand said.

Si e conclusa con successo la prima edizione di Ride Out Experience. Manifestazione concepita con l'intento di offrire un'esperienza motociclistica a 360°, e che ha visto la partecipazione di 20 Adventurieri che a bordo delle proprie bicilindriche (non solo KTM), hanno sfidato il maltempo per trascorrere una giornata in compagnia di Ktm e Pirelli con il preciso obiettivo di affinare le proprie tecniche di guida in fuoristrada e testare i nuovi modelli della famiglia KTM Adventure equipaggiati con gli pneumatici della gamma Pirelli Scorpion.   Pirelli Scorpion Rally STR rappresenta una rivoluzione nel mondo degli pneumatici per moto adventure perche riesce a conciliare e racchiudere in se le migliori prestazioni di uno pneumatico da competizione rally con quelle di uno pneumatico da enduro stradale. Le moto messe a disposizione da KTM per i test ride erano la piccola e leggera 390 Adventure, le innovative e versatili 790 Adventure e 790 Adventure R e le potentissime e ipertecnologiche 1290 Super Adventure S e 1290 SUPER Adventure R.   Teatro dell'evento e stato lo splendido Castello Dal Pozzo, a Oleggio Castello (NO). Qui lo staff di Pirelli e KTM, supportato dalla presenza degli istruttori federali qualificati della scuola di motociclismo In moto col Gigi, ha accolto i 20 proprietari di maxi-enduro selezionati in base ai migliori contenuti postati sui profili personali Facebook e Instagram utilizzando l'hashtag #rideoutexperience. Dopo una breve fase introduttiva gli ospiti, incuranti della pioggia battente, hanno effettuato un primo tour guidato di "warm up" a bordo delle proprie moto alla scoperta delle bellissime strade che portano verso il Lago D'Orta; al ritorno al "campo base" sono stati suddivisi in tre gruppi a seconda della propria esperienza e propensione alla guida in fuoristrada e hanno partecipato a tre sessioni denominate Tour, Park e Test. Le sessioni tour e Park prevedevano l'utilizzo della propria motocicletta e si sono svolte la prima su strada e la seconda in fuoristrada sui percorsi offroad ricavati ad hoc all'interno del parco che circonda il Castello Dal Pozzo; la sessione Test si e svolta a bordo dei modelli KTM Adventure equipaggiati con pneumatici Pirelli Scorpion Rally STR e ha visto i partecipanti affrontare percorsi misti su strada e in fuoristrada.   Nonostante le condizioni meteo impegnative i 20 partecipanti si sono divertiti e hanno apprezzato i paesaggi e le strade che circondano il Lago Maggiore. Le sessioni di guida in fuoristrada sono state rese difficili a causa delle abbondanti precipitazioni, ma nessuno ha rinunciato al test ride a bordo delle KTM Adventure gommate Pirelli Scorpion Rally STR, che in queste condizioni impegnative hanno dato il meglio di se.

It probably does seem easy to make all this appear so effortless. Maybe it's Savage's laconic flow or the steady confidence with which Metro pushes the boundaries of his sonic experimentation. But the truth is so many "sequel" efforts in hip-hop often fall flat, failing to reach the heights promised by the sequential naming convention. I've written about this before -- multiple times -- but the axiom remains as true as ever: Exceptions to the rule are (mostly) few and far between. While I'm not sure what it says that _Savage Mode II_ released within a month of Big Sean's _Detroit 2_ , it's clear that as the music business flounders in the wake of massive shutdowns, further artists will probably see the _2K_ franchise model as a quick boost of income.

The hotel would use only 266sq metres of the original 1,400 "which is too small to function", the planning inspector was told. The scheme proposed by New York's Raycliff developers incorporates the listed foundry built in 1740 for the bell-casting business that began in Tudor times. It is being challenged by conservationists who want it reopened as a working foundry and arts centre after being closed in 2017. "The developers would provide 'industrial window dressing' to justify the hotel," Matthew Dale-Harris representing the objectors told the hearing. "This would be too small to function behind a pain of glass, which is patronising the foundry and a heritage loss of architectural significance." The foundry can be reopened to preserve its significance, campaigners maintain. It would be run as the London Bell Foundry by an international trust and would continue industrial heritage and pass on foundry skills to future generations. "This site is a sole survivor of pre-industrial times which is in the Whitechapel conservation area designated," Mr Dale-Harris added. "Even the 1980s unlisted extension at the rear contributes to the narrative of the foundry which would be drowned out by the hotel scheme." But the developers insist they are preserving the foundry functions and deny running a reduced casting "for the entertainment of coffee drinkers" in the hotel. Architect William Burgess from the 31\/44 Whitechapel practice, who was hired in 2017 to look into the redevelopment, denied allegations that they were "hollowing out" the foundry's history to remove its significance in the proposed themed hotel. He had "spent many hours" with the foundry's former owners Catharine and Allen Hughes on the site to see how to preserve its historic character. "We are not being schizophrenic about the design ," Mr Burgess told the inquiry. "We don't go in and whitewash walls. The steel gantries and girders are being retained within the building, along with the bell-tuning machine. It's a heritage-led design with minimum intervention approach." But there was increasing pressure in the City Fringe area for commercial office space, shops, and banking, it was pointed out. The three-storey foundry was "largely consumed by its surroundings with a nine- storey neighbour" and other pressures and was already "slightly consumed by the cityscape around it". The site was in poor condition and had suffered lack of investment over the years. The developers who took it over when the foundry closed in 2017 brought in the Westley engineering group from the Midlands to run the reduced foundry with AB Fine Art from Poplar if the hotel got the go- ahead. Its chairman Tom Westley has been giving evidence to the inquiry this- afternoon as part of the hotel proposal on the feasibility of Whitechapel foundry casting--while casting doubt on the preservationists' alternative proposals. He believes reopening the whole foundry wouldn't make commercial sense with the reduced world market for church bell-casting, but hand-bell casting could work out in the reduced space. Yet Westley's company website says it wants to "continue the Whitechapel tradition of casting church bells and preserve a much older craft heritage". The foundry is famed for casting America's Liberty Bell in 1757 and Big Ben in 1858 when the Houses of Parliament were rebuilt. The planning inspector is visiting Whitechapel at 9.30 Wednesday morning, October 7, to see for himself its historic significance where the boutique hotel is proposed. The public hearings resume Thursday at 10am.

Probably quite a few. But if the money had arrived in the St James' Park coffers, doors would have been opened and players would have arrived.


  United's alternative, Saudi-fuelled target list identified the likes of Valencia's Ferran Torres (who ended up at Manchester City) and Bournemouth's Nathan Ake as prime targets. Lille's Victor Osimhen was among the names while the Hollywood star dust seemed to be supplied by the likes of Gareth Bale and Ciro Immobile, who claimed approaches from those close to the takeover.


  There certainly would have been funds. The PIF's detailed business plan included a supplementary £50million for each of the next five transfer windows - meaning the Newcastle would have had £80million to spend this time around. That's a transformative amount when you look at the sort of transfer fees being spent.


  And who knows what else might have shaken out?


  As ridiculous as it sounds from here United - backed by PIF money - might well have been in the Lionel Messi conversation when he first burofaxed Barcelona to tell them he wanted out.

But for those behind bars who didn't file a tax return in 2018 or 2019, another deadline is looming -- they have until Oct. 15 to send a written application for the relief checks, or they may not receive them at all.

“The expansion is still far from complete,” Powell said in a speech to the National Association for Business Economics, a group of corporate and academic economists. “Too little support would lead to a weak recovery, creating unnecessary hardship for households and businesses. Over time, household insolvencies and business bankruptcies would rise, harming the productive capacity of the economy, and holding back wage growth.”


  Powell noted that the economic recovery has slowed in recent months compared with its rapid improvement in May and June. Incomes fell in August. And job growth weakened in September, slowing to just 661,000, less than half the gains of 1.5 million in August and 1.8 million in September. The economy has recovered only slightly more than half the 22 million jobs that were lost in March and April.


  “A prolonged slowing in the pace of improvement over time could trigger typical recessionary dynamics, as weakness feeds on weakness,” he said.


  During a question-and-answer session with economists, Powell noted that the pandemic recession has disproportionately harmed in-person service industries, especially restaurants, bars, hotels, travel companies, movie theatres and other entertainment venues. The heavy damage to those industries has left millions of people unemployed, likely for an extended period, until they are either finally recalled to their previous jobs or switch to new careers.


  “The right thing to do and the smart thing to do in the long run is to support those people as they return to their old jobs or find new jobs,” the chairman said.

Coincidentally, Yankees third base coach Phil Nevin was a slugger for the Padres when Petco Park opened in 2004 with vast outfield dimensions. He and Ryan Klesko groused about how they'd crush a ball that would be a homer in other parks, only to watch it go for a long out. Nevin once hit a double that he thought should have been a homer. After reaching second, he gestured angrily toward general manager Kevin Towers' box. The two later had words in the clubhouse.

Living behind bars is expensive for inmates and their families, Dermody said. A 15-minute phone call with family members can cost more than $20 in some states, and inmates often must buy additional food to meet their nutritional needs. In many correction systems they also must purchase their own personal hygiene items such as soap, shampoo and cleaning supplies -- a need that is even greater during the coronavirus pandemic. Prison and jail jobs can be hard to get and typically only pay cents on the dollar, so much of the financial burden falls on inmates' friends and family members -- who may already be dealing with the loss of an income provider in addition to pandemic-related job losses and illness.

  It added: “The sooner we can return, the sooner we can reunite communities and support local jobs, livelihoods, regional businesses and also the national economy.


  “We will continue to urge Government to allow us to return fans safely to stadiums.


  “It is positive progress that major arts and music venues have been told they can run socially-distanced events indoors. And now football should be allowed to do the same - in highly regulated and stewarded outdoor environments.


  “And in light of the postponement of test events we will intensify our efforts to pioneer new approaches - working with epidemiologists, scientists and medical experts in areas such as public health, clinical processes and occupational hygiene.

State rules and regulations require that seeding be suspended in situations such as when blizzards are already in the forecast or snowpack reaches a level that it creates flooding concerns.


  Altogether, there are eight cloud-seeding programs in Colorado. Funding comes from a variety of sources, including Front Range municipal water entities and from within states in the Colorado River’s Lower Basin.


  Andrew Rickert with the Colorado Water Conservation Board said at the Grand Mesa program hearing that new funding is allowing for three new remote seeders to be installed in Colorado, including one on Grand Mesa if the permit there is renewed. Statewide, some 112 manual seeders and 13 remote stations are in use now.


  No one spoke in opposition to the Grand Mesa program in the recent hearing. Dave Kanzer, deputy chief engineer for the Colorado River District, said at the hearing that the district supports the permit renewal.
