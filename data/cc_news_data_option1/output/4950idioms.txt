New Delhi:


  Help poured in for hundreds of farmers stationed at the Ghazipur-Ghaziabad border (UP Gate border) on Wednesday as local residents distributed food, water, fruits and other items to the protesters.


  Many volunteers of nearby gurudwaras and madarsas were seen distributing food, water, tea, snacks, and fruits to the farmers throughout the day.


  Nitin Atri, who runs a milk products shop in Sahibabad in Ghaziabad, said, "I may not be a farmer but my forefathers were and that is the reason I can connect with the cause of farmers who have gathered here to protest against the farm laws. I won't sleep in peace if farmers sleep hungry near my house."


   


   


  Atri and his relatives and friends distributed food and bottled water during the lunch hour. Atri and his friends said they pooled in money and will continue their service till the protest continues.


  Among the volunteers were five children aged between 3 and 16 years from a family living in Vasundhara in Ghaziabad. They had come with their grandmother and other family members to distribute food and water. While the elder ones took charge of food distribution, the children were enthusiastically offering water bottles not only to the farmers but also to the police personnel deployed there.


  The children said their grandfather Surender Singh joined the farmers ever since the agitation began. "I came to the protest venue on Monday to meet my grandfather and felt bad when I saw the farmers were arranging meals for themselves. I asked my family if we can contribute. They agreed and arranged ration and packed water," said 16-year-old Kajal, a Class 12 student.


  After the lunch, around 4 pm, a five-member volunteer group from a madarasa in Mayur Vihar arrived in a tempo with apples and oranges.


  Some Congress workers were seen offering tea and snacks to the farmers. As all of them were wearing scarves with the logo and symbol of the party, many farmers asked them either to remove their scarves or leave the venue.


  After a brief discussion, the party workers removed the scarves and continued the distribution of tea and snacks.


  Overall, the situation at the Ghazipur-Ghaziabad border remained peaceful on Wednesday. The farmers were seen resting in makeshift tents made on their tractors and on the road as well.

New Delhi:


  Keeping in mind the Covid-19 pandemic, Jamia Millia Islamia will hold its semester exams in December in the online mode using the "proctored " method, which uses technology to monitor a user computer's webcam and audio to check for unfair means.


  The decision was taken after a meeting of university officials with vice- chancellor Najma Akhtar and deans of all faculties on Wednesday.


  "The concern of travelling during the pandemic is genuine as there has been a rise in the number of Covid-19 cases in Delhi and other states. Since calling them here for offline exams during such a scenario would not be safe, we have decided to hold proctored exams for the students," Akhtar told HT.


   


   


  Following the nationwide Covid-19 lockdown in March, institutes in the national capital - including Jamia - have been closed for regular classes and exams. During the last semester, the university evaluated its students based on multiple assignments. Following the University Grants Commission guidelines over conducting exams, the varsity decided to conduct exams this time instead of doing assessments.


  "Students will be provided the schedule beforehand. They would have to sit in front of their computers, download the question paper, write it without using any unfair means on a sheet of paper, and send it to us by either scanning it or taking a photograph," Akhtar said. The university plans to rope in agencies that conduct such exams.


  Controller of examinations and registrar Nazim Hussain Jafri said, "Online exams can be conducted in three ways such as centre-based, open book, or the proctored way. We found that the proctored way would be most feasible as it would help to check against unfair means. There will be cameras which will help us determine if students are looking here and there for help."


  Akhtar said students without access to laptops and computers will be able to use their phones for the exams. "If the computer software detects any movement or hint of unfair means, it will alert the systems and our teachers, who will be overseeing the exams as invigilators, will check that student," she said.


  The decision is likely to bring relief to students who had been concerned over the fate of their papers following the November 26 notification that said exams would be held from December 29 without any other details.


  Laraib Ahmad Neyazi, a postgraduate student at the university, said, "The recent surge in Covid-19 cases in Delhi, having entered its third wave, has become a major issue of concern, especially for outstation students. Since there was no official notification over how exams will be conducted, it had been unsettling. If the authorities had decided to conduct offline exams, booking tickets during a pandemic would require time and will be subject to availability."

But even once the pandemic ends, travelers' habits are likely to change. For starters, they'll be more focused on getting to their destination than getting a deal on socks at the airport.


  And the city, belatedly, is paying attention to that. "We've got to modify," Hancock said six months into the pandemic. "We are in constant consultation with airlines and airline experts." Better late than never...though getting his head in the game a few years earlier might have saved the city money and months, even years, of construction.


  Still, against all odds, Denver International Airport -- which seemed like such a far-off gamble back in the late '80s -- has paid off for the city. Says Hancock, "It's still the place that passengers want to fly in and out of."

The team also noted an unusual "coffee ring effect" in the red ink markings. The coffee ring effect occurs when a single liquid evaporates and the solids that had been dissolved in the liquid, like coffee grounds, form a telltale ring. It happens because the evaporation occurs faster at the edge than at the center. Any remaining liquid flows outward to the edge to fill in the gaps, dragging those solids with it. In this case, the red ocher pigment is present in coarse particles, which stayed in place while the more finely ground soluble lead compounds diffused into the papyrus cells to create a ring effect, making it appear (at the micrometer scale) as if the letters had been outlined.

Following concerns and queries over the online open-book examination (OBE) beginning next week at Delhi University, students appearing for the exams are looking to their recently graduated alumni for assistance.


  Last week, Delhi University had issued guidelines for the online open-book semester examination, for second and third-year undergraduate students, slated to begin from December 12.


  Several colleges are planning to organise online sessions with recent graduates who appeared for the first-ever OBEs at the university in August. The varsity decision to conduct OBE as a one-time measure in view of the Covid-19 pandemic had been met with staunch opposition from several students and faculty members, but it went ahead with the process nevertheless. Several glitches were reported during the exams, including students receiving the wrong question paper or being unable to submit their answer scripts on time.


  Divyanshika Pandey, a final-year student of economics at Miranda House, said, "We have asked students to send their queries as a Google form and those will be sent to our graduates. The graduates will circulate it among their groups so that anyone can respond. A virtual session is also likely to be held towards the weekend."


   


   


  The queries posed by students include doubts about the paper pattern, time management, how to upload answer scripts on the portal and possible glitches that may arise.


  "Our teachers have also been helping us but it is always better to hear from former students on how to structure answers and understand how these answers are then graded. The logistical queries are also there -- like how to upload scripts and what to do in case of an error. We have been interacting with some graduates over the semester but a last-minute session would help," she said.


  Similar attempts are made at Hindu College and Lady Shri Ram College as well. Hindu principal Anju Shrivastava said graduates proposed the idea to the college to help out their departments and encourage those appearing for their papers. She said that these interactions are organised by department societies in the college.


  Anupam Varshney Sharma, who teaches zoology at the college, said, "We had a meeting with teachers in charge of other departments and the principal as students were facing problems. We thought it would be better if students could connect with recent graduates as the latter would be able to give valuable inputs."


  Unlike August, when students were allowed to email answer scripts, the university has issued strict guidelines this time -- undergraduate students will only be allowed to submit answer scripts through the examination portal. Dean (examinations) DS Rawat said the glitches that came up during the last OBE were addressed by the varsity's computer centre.

CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) — Wyoming's governor says he disagrees with a state Republican Party resolution calling on him to rescind a state of emergency in place since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. Gov. Mark Gordon, a Republican, called the resolution approved by the Wyoming State Republican Central Committee in mid-November a “very unfortunate choice.” Besides allowing the state health officer to issue public-health orders, the state of emergency Gordon issued in March makes it easier for hospitals and others to get funding and other resources to help deal with the virus, Gordon said Tuesday in a virtual meeting with the Wyoming Tribune Eagle editorial board. “I just think it was an unfortunate resolution but it’s perhaps a sign of the times of how far apart this country has become,” he continued. “I certainly hope to work with GOP leadership to try to find a way to sort of rethink what that resolution was.” Gordon's comments came a day after Wyoming reported a record 247 coronavirus hospitalizations and as he himself was experiencing mild symptoms of the virus. Gordon tested positive on Nov. 25. Wyoming GOP Chairman Frank Eathorne didn’t respond to requests for comment. Gordon suggested additional statewide health orders could come soon as he worried about the potential for a “surge upon the surge” over the holiday season. “Our concern is how do we make sure that our infection rate gets down,” Gordon said. “That’s going to take more stringent steps.” State officials also want to help give businesses a “fighting chance” this winter before a vaccine hopefully reduces infections, Gordon said.

However, the Magpies would no longer be able to replicate moves for the likes of Kevin Mbabu and Ayoze Perez, and more recently the likes of Elias Sorensen.


  The weighted scoring system means signings from 'Band 1' competitions such as the Bundesliga, La Liga, Ligue 1 and Serie A are almost certain to comfortably pass the threshold. However, these are already crowded transfer markets and ones United would face strong competition in at every turn.


  But while top-flight clubs come to terms with the reality of operating in a transfer market under these new regulations, there is an alternative the Magpies could look to exploit.


  South America could become a market of greater interest to clubs such as United as a result of the new rules, with a seemingly favourable points-based system.


  This comes in part from the decision to award the Copa Libertadores and Copa Sudamerica equal status with the Champions League and Europa League respectively in the scoring metric. Consequently, this will make it easier for United to sign players who regularly feature in these competitions.


  It is also aided by a generous 'auto pass' through the process for players who are regulars for international sides ranked in the top 50 of FIFA's world rankings. As it stands, eight teams from the continent occupy these places including Miguel Almiron's Paraguay.


  There is also the bonus of the Campeonato Brasileiro Série A and Primera División of Argentina both being classified as 'Band 3' competitions alongside the Russian Premier League and Scottish Premiership.

US health officials on Wednesday recommended a shortened quarantine period for people exposed to Covid-19, from 14 to 10 days if they haven't taken a test and have not developed symptoms.                    This can be further reduced to just seven days if the exposed person receives a negative test, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) scientist Henry Walke said.                    "Reducing the length of quarantine may make it easier for people to take this critical public health action, reducing the economic hardship associated with a longer period, especially if they cannot work during that time," he said.                    "We believe that if we can reduce the burden a little bit, accepting that it comes at a small cost, we may get a greater compliance overall."                                                                                    The US is seeing more than 150,000 new cases a day and is bracing for a coronavirus super-surge following extensive travel over the Thanksgiving holiday.                    The new guidance, which will be posted on the CDC's website and passed on to state and other local jurisdictions, was based on the latest research regarding infectiousness and how the disease progresses.                    But, Walke stressed, it isn't risk-free and people who end quarantine early should continue to monitor for symptoms for the full 14 days.                    Reducing the quarantine period from 14 to 10 days comes with a "residual risk" the person leaving early could transmit to someone else at between 1-12 percent, according to CDC calculations.                    For the seven-day quarantine with a negative test, the residual risk of onward transmission is 5-10 percent.                    In addition, the CDC also announced testing guidance in light of Thanksgiving travel and in anticipation of more of the same over the Christmas holiday period.                    CDC epidemiologist Cindy Friedman stressed that the safest option was to postpone all plans.                    But if people do decide to travel, the agency recommends they get a viral test one to three days before their trip, and consider getting tested after their trip within three to five days.                    This should be accompanied by reducing non-essential activities for a full seven days after travel, even if the test is negative.                    "Testing does not eliminate all risks, but when it's combined with reducing non-essential activities, symptom screening, other precautions such as wearing masks and social distancing, it can make travel safer," she said.

  The deceased was identified as Geeta, a resident of Adarsh Nagar, Nayagaon. Her husband, Kamal, who was riding the scooter, also sustained injuries.


  Police said the couple was waiting for the traffic light to turn green, when a speeding Maruti Swift car hit their scooter from behind.


  The impact of the collision tossed the couple in the air and caused severe injuries as they crashed on the road. Kamal and Geeta were rushed to PGIMER, where the latter was declared brought dead.

  He has been booked under Sections 279 (rash driving), 304-A (causing death by negligence) and 337 (causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) of the Indian Penal Code on the complaint of Kamal's relative Paan Singh, of Manimajra, Chandigarh.


  Kamal said they had come to Sector 25, Chandigarh, to meet Geeta's parents.

(AP) – The government has decided that when it comes to air travel, only dogs can be service animals, and companions used for emotional support don’t count.The Transportation Department issued a final rule Wednesday that aims to settle years of tension between airlines and passengers who bring their pets on board for free by saying they need them for emotional support.For years, the department required airlines to allow animals with passengers who had a doctor’s note saying they needed the animal for emotional support. Airlines believed passengers abused the rule to bring a menagerie of animals on board including cats, turtles, pigs and in one case, a peacock.The agency said Wednesday that it was rewriting the rules partly because passengers carrying unusual animals on board “eroded the public trust in legitimate service animals.” It also cited the increasing frequency of people “fraudulently representing their pets as service animals,” and a rise in misbehavior by emotional-support animals.The new rule will force passengers with emotional-support animals to check them into the cargo hold — and pay a pet fee — or leave them at home. The agency estimated airlines will gain up to $59.6 million a year in pet fees.Under the final rule, which takes effect in 30 days, a service animal is a dog trained to help a person with a physical or psychiatric disability. Advocates for veterans and others had pushed for inclusion of psychiatric service dogs.Airlines will be able to require owners to vouch for the dog’s health, behavior and training. Airlines can require people with a service dog to turn in paperwork up to 48 hours before a flight, but they can’t bar those travelers from checking in online like other passengers.Airlines can require that service dogs to be leashed at all times, and they can bar dogs that show aggressive behavior. There have been incidents of emotional-support animals biting passengers.The Transportation Department stood by an earlier decision to prohibit airlines from banning entire dog breeds. That is a setback for Delta Air Lines, which banned “pit bull type dogs” in 2018, a move that was criticized by disability advocates.Delta, however, is giving no indication of backing down. In a statement, a Delta spokeswoman said the airline is reviewing the new rule but, “At this time, there are no changes to Delta’s current service and support animal policies.”Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

Lacy remembers having doubts about applying for positions like brigade commander when she was a midshipman. Now an active-duty Navy captain, she said she learned “not to self-eliminate.”                                    “Those were the words that I used when I talked to her, and I did tell her to reach for the stars and not to sell herself short," said Lacy, who is now legislative director for the Office of the Chief of Navy Reserve.                                    Barber, who aspires to be commissioned as a Marine Corps ground officer, will be the 16th woman to be brigade commander at the academy. The first, Juliane Gallina, held the position in 1991.                                    Similar ground was broken at the U.S. Military Academy in New York in 2017, when Simone Askew became the first Black female first captain, the highest position in the cadet chain of command at West Point.                                    Women were first allowed into the nation’s service academies in 1976. That’s also when Janie Mines became the first Black woman to enter the Naval Academy, graduating four years later in 1980. While the number of women at the academy has been rising, it's still currently about 72% male and 28% female.                                    In a social media post, Mines wrote that Barber's selection “brought me to tears. This young woman, Midshipman Sydney Barber, will be the first Black Female Brigade Commander at the U.S. Naval Academy. 40 years later. Thank you, Sydney! Love you!"

I've always spoken about anything that's wrong with the system. I have a lot of followers, so when I feel there's something messed up going on in society, I like to talk about it.

The arrival of fruits and vegetables at Delhi's biggest agriculture produce market in Azadpur has dropped significantly since the farmers' blackade began at Delhi borders six days ago.


  The number of trucks reaching the market has reduced from around 11,500 a day -- the normal for this time of the year -- to around 6,000 trucks a day, said Adil Khan, chairperson of the agriculture produce market committee (APMC) in Azadpur.


  Several traders from the three prominent APMCs in Delhi - Azadpur, Ghazipur and Okhla - told HT that most traders have stopped sending fruits and vegetables to other states temporarily and have been focusing only on local supply as their stocks are limited. That, they said, has so far helped to keep wholesale and retail prices stable in Delhi.


  "But traders are running out of stock. And, the arrivals are very low. So, a demand-supply gap will surface soon - probably in another three to four days -- if the borders remain blocked. Then, the prices will go up," said Anil Malhotra, a wholesale trader based in Azadpur.


   


   


  Traders in Ghazipur and Okhla echoed similar concerns regarding supply shortage and potential shoot-up in prices.


  Green peas, potatoes and some varieties of apples and oranges -- which largely arrive from the northern states through the border points of SInghu and Tikri, which are now blocked -- are some of the items that have witnessed the sharpest dip in arrivals across the three agriculture markets, the traders said.


  On Tuesday, HT had reported how trucks laden with goods are currently stranded on the Kondli highway with no place to go.


  Naveen Gupta, general secretary of the All India Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC) said the queue of trucks awaiting entry into Delhi at the Singhu border alone is as long as around 5 kilometres now.


  "Entry of trucks into Delhi has almost come to a complete halt because of the ongoing protest. Though we do not have an exact number of trucks stuck at the borders, but it is safe to say that more than 1,500 trucks are stuck. Per day, the losses being faced by truck owners is around Rs 2,500 per truck, including taxes, cost of the driver and the loss in the number of trips. The problem is that because of the delay the clients are also likely to deduct money from their total payment," he said.

The 2019-20 LA Clippers never quite jelled, in part, because of the preferential treatment of Kawhi Leonard and Paul George, according to The Athletic's Jovan Buha.


  Leonard and George, of course, were the two big offseason acquisitions for the Clippers in July 2019. Landing the two All-Star forwards to a team of versatile roles players immediately pushed the Clippers to the top of the championship race.


  According to Buha, Clippers teammates, particularly hold-overs from the surprise 2018-19 playoff team, bristled at the star treatment Leonard and George received. Such privileges includes their own trainers and security teams, influence over practice and travel schedules, and looser media obligations, which left other teammates to be the de facto voices of the team.


  Buha previously reported in October that Leonard was also allowed to live in San Diego, which often made him late for team events such as flights.

HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (WAFF) - Huntsville City School students will be out of the classroom for the remainder of this week, as school administrators deal with a cyber security threat.HCS officials said they’re working with Huntsville Police and the FBI to get to the bottom of the potential ransomware attack.This leaves parents in the system with a lot of questions about their children’s private information and what the end of this semester will look like.Tori Medina has kids at Mountain Gap Elementary and Middle School and Erin Batrich has a freshman at Grissom High School.Both said their concerns are high about criminals possibly having private information.“Immediately I was like, ‘Oh, my God, kids’ socials, oh my God, kid’s birthdays, oh my God, our address,’ you know?” Medina said. “Immediately, I just started thinking, ‘How do we handle this or how do we get a handle on this?”In a statement, HCS officials said they’re not sure what information, if any, has been compromised at this point.At the same time as the investigation, students are also trying to get ready for their finals.“It’s one thing if you have a snow day and they can be at home and virtual and working on things like that, but actually losing days of work time is devastating at this point,” Batrich said.Despite the situation, the parents did appreciate how the school system handled it. Both agreed administrators acted quickly to get kids out of school and told everyone to shut their computers down.Dr. Tommy Morris is the Director of the Center for Cyber Security Research and Education at UAH, he said ransomeware is becoming more common and everyone needs to be ready for it.Morris said with most ransomware, it typically goes one of two ways.“One is to actually pay and hope that the hacker actually decrypts your data and gives it back to you, there’s no guarantee to that,” Morris said. “You have to trust a criminal again. The other possible likely outcome is they have done a good job with backups and they have most of the data and will only lose a little bit and won’t be forced to pay.”This leaves room for a lot of concerns.“Will the data be lost permanently or not?” Morris said. “Hopefully there are good backups in the district so that the amount of data that will ultimately be affected is minimized, you also have to worry about the record themselves because they’re ultimately no longer private.”Morris said once the data has been compromised, there’s no way to get it back. Those hackers will have it.As for the criminals on the other end, Morris said a majority of the time it is very hard to prosecute or even identify who it could be.While schools are shut down, meals will be ready for curbside pickup for students at every Huntsville City School campus from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m.Copyright 2020 WAFF.

Stigler's team motto before the season started was, "Make History."


   


  Thanks to a stellar performance by quarterback Darren Manes, the Panthers are doing just that.


   


  Manes accounted for all seven touchdowns in Stigler's 49-14 win at previously undefeated Kingston in last Friday's 3A quarterfinals.


   


  That win sends the Panthers (11-1) into their first state semifinal appearance since 1971.


   


  "That feels so great," Manes selected as the Times Record's Athlete of the Week said. "Starting this year, we came up with a team motto, 'Make History,' and that's what we're doing right now, and we just want to keep continuing to get better and try to go all the way and win it all."


   


  Manes was a main reason why Stigler is now just two wins away from a state title, which would be the first in program history.


   


  Against Kingston, he completed 14-of-22 passes for 308 yards and six touchdowns.


   


  "No, I didn't think I was going to be able to throw that many touchdown passes this week," Manes said. "They had a really big defensive line, and this week, our line really stepped up and they gave me four to five seconds every play we had.


   


  "Also, my receivers had great separation; they ran great routes, and they did everything I could ask for in terms of me to just put it on them and take it to the house."


   


  Manes added his personal favorite of those six TDs was a toss to senior receiver Braden Drewry, who caught three of those TD passes.


   


  "We had Braden run a post and my line created a wall up-field," Manes said. "I stepped up in the pocket and threw it for about 30 yards and he just took it all the way.


   


  "(Our receivers) have really good speed, but it's just the way they know how to run routes that really separates them from most receivers."


   


  Manes also added a rushing touchdown last week as he carried the ball 14 times for 36 yards. On the season, Manes has rushed for 735 yards and 14 TDs.


   


  "I think our line is our key to our offense. ... They're not the biggest, but they've got heart and they'll create gaps for me to get where I need to be," Manes said.


   


  And the Panthers' line has also given Manes time to throw. He has passed for 1,154 yards this season and 16 TDs while being intercepted only one time.


   


  For most of the season, Manes had rotated at quarterback with fellow senior Zane Oldham.


   


  But prior to the playoffs, Stigler coach Chris Risenhoover shifted Oldham to receiver due to an injury to one of their other wideouts, allowing Manes to take over behind center on a full-time basis.


   


  Manes has taken advantage of the situation. In Stigler's two playoff wins, he has passed for a total of 537 yards and eight TDs while adding 138 yards rushing and three TDs.


   


  While Manes is a senior, it's actually his first season with the Panthers, having transferred to Stigler in the off-season from the East Texas town of New Diana, located near Longview.


   


  "I'm loving it," Manes said of Stigler. "There's great people here and great teammates and everybody's wonderful, everyone's nice."


   


  And Manes is just as ecstatic to be working with Risenhoover, who has produced many outstanding quarterbacks during his decade-plus tenure as Stigler's coach.


   


  "When he tells you to run this play because it's going to work, it works every single time, and I've never ran his stuff and have it not work," Manes said of Risenhoover. "His plays are just drawn up perfectly and he knows what he's doing, he has a lot of experience and I guess it all ties in together."


   


  This Friday, Manes and his Panther teammates attempt to make even more history as Stigler travels to Tulsa to take on undefeated Holland Hall in the 3A semifinals.


   


  "I think this week we're going to have to be very disciplined. ... If we just stay disciplined and keep it in our heads, we'll be all right," Manes said.

The police on Tuesday night arrested the owner of a car involved in a collision with a motorcycle that left the rider, a 49-year-old chief financial officer (CFO) of a private company, dead on August 23 in Cyber City. The car was allegedly driven by a minor, who was inebriated at the time of the incident.


  On Wednesday, the police also apprehended a juvenile who was a co-passenger in the car, under Section 304 (2) of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of Juvenile Justice Act. The police said he will undergo a test to determine his age and was produced before the Juvenile Justice Board.


  The car owner, identified as Dheeraj Taneja, has been booked under Section 109 (punishment for the offence for which there is no express provision made and the act is in consequence of the abetment by conspiracy) of the IPC and Section 77 (giving intoxicating liquor or narcotic drug or psychotropic substance to a child) of Juvenile Justice Act and was sent to judicial custody.


  On August 23, the victim, Alok Gupta, was on his way to Noida on his Harley Davidson motorcycle around 6am, when a Ford Figo, in which the two juveniles were allegedly travelling, rammed into the divider and hit his motorcycle across the carriageway. Gupta had succumbed to his injuries and the police had registered an FIR against the juvenile driver and owner of car, a friend of the driver's father, under sections 279 (rash driving or riding on a public way) and 304 A (death by negligence) of the IPC.


   


   


  According to the police, the juveniles had attended a party at Taneja's house and had allegedly consumed alcohol, after which they went out for a drive. The juvenile driving the car was apprehended earlier.


  KK Rao, the commissioner of police, said Taneja was arrested under non- bailable sections and the juvenile was sent to an observation home in Faridabad. "As per the earlier sections, the suspects were released on bail but after the investigation was reopened, the sections were added and they were arrested. We have taken legal opinion and all relevant sections have been added and all arrests have been made," he said.


  Mihika Wahi Gupta, the victim's wife, said she wants justice and also to spread awareness, to curb underage driving. "This accident is an eye-opener and the police should start booking parents and juvenile for underage driving. I am fighting for justice and will make sure the persons responsible for my husband's death are behind bars," she said.


  Earlier, the victim's family had approached the police commissioner over alleged negligence in the investigation and sought more stringent sections of the IPC. Gupta's family wanted the teenager who was at the wheel booked under Section 304(II) (rash or negligent act not amounting to culpable homicide) of the IPC instead of Section 304(a) which is 'negligence causing death'. Also, they wanted the owner of the car to be booked, following which sections 309 and 304(II) of the IPC and sections of JJ Act were added.


  On November 9, Rao suspended two policemen, including the station house officer (SHO) of DLF Phase 2 police station.


  The accident and the subsequent handling of the case by the police evoked widespread protests by the family and friends of the victim. On September 26, at least 400 people, including family members, friends and cyclists, carrying placards and banners, had taken out a solidarity march from DT Mega Mall to the crime spot, near DLF Phase 2 Rapid Metro station, demanding justice and action against those responsible.


  Similar protests were also held in Delhi, Noida, Nagpur, Lucknow, Indore and Jaipur.

ATLANTA (AP) — A top Georgia elections official on Tuesday lashed out angrily at the rhetoric surrounding the election and the threats of violence that have resulted, specifically calling on President Donald Trump to rein in his supporters.Gabriel Sterling is a Republican who oversaw the implementation of the state’s new voting system. During a routine news conference at the state Capitol to provide an update on the recount of the presidential race requested by Trump, Sterling admonished the president and Georgia’s two U.S. senators, who are both locked in tight runoff races against Democrats and have called on GOP Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to resign over claims that he mishandled the election.“Mr. President, you have not condemned these actions or this language. Senators, you have not condemned this language or these actions,” Sterling said, visibly angry. “This has to stop. We need you to step up, and if you’re going to take a position of leadership, show some.”Trump, though, didn’t seem to take the upbraiding to heart, reiterating unproven claims of fraud relating to mail-in ballots in a tweet late Tuesday that replied to an Atlanta TV journalist who tweeted about Sterling’s denunciation.“Rigged Election,” Trump tweeted. “Show signatures and envelopes. Expose the massive voter fraud in Georgia. What is Secretary of State and Brian Kemp afraid of. They know what we’ll find!!!”People have been driving in caravans past Raffensperger’s home, have come onto his property and have sent sexualized threats to his wife’s cellphone, said Sterling. Raffensperger and Sterling both have police stationed outside their homes, and the Georgia Bureau of Investigation has said it’s investigating possible threats against officials to determine their credibility.Sterling said his anger boiled over when he learned that a contractor with Dominion Voting Systems helping with the recount effort in suburban Gwinnett County received death threats after someone shot video of him transferring a report to a county computer and falsely said the young man was manipulating election data.“There’s a noose out there with his name on it. That’s not right,” Sterling said, adding that the contractor didn’t seek the spotlight by taking a high-profile position like Sterling or run for office like Raffensperger. “This kid took a job. He just took a job.”Trump last week called Raffensperger an “enemy of the people,” Sterling noted, adding, “That helped open the floodgates to this kind of crap.”Sterling urged the president to step up and tell his supporters not to commit acts of violence. “Someone’s going to get hurt. Someone’s going to get shot. Someone’s going to get killed,” Sterling said.Trump campaign spokesperson Tim Murtaugh said in a statement Tuesday evening, “No one should engage in threats or violence, and if that has happened, we condemn that fully.”The campaigns for Republican U.S. Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler both issued statements Tuesday evening condemning violence but also criticizing election officials, according to news outlets.“Like many officials, as someone who has been the subject of threats, of course Senator Loeffler condemns violence of any kind. How ridiculous to even suggest otherwise,” Loeffler campaign spokesman Stephen Lawson said. “We also condemn inaction and lack of accountability in our election system process — and won’t apologize for calling it out.”Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

The quarantine can end after 10 days without a test if a person monitors potential symptoms, such as fever, on a daily basis and has none. The exposed person is expected to continue monitoring symptoms and wearing a mask for the full 14 days despite discontinuing quarantine.


  The CDC was looking for "the sweet spot," the federal official said, where the recommended quarantine would capture the majority of potentially infectious people but also lead to higher compliance. CDC scientists calculated that, for people discontinuing quarantine after seven days, the "residual post-quarantine transmission risk" is about 5%, dropping to 1% for those who quarantine for 10 days under the new guidance.


  Two prominent infectious-disease experts welcomed the news of the revised guidance Wednesday.


  "Behind the scenes, many of us had been urging the CDC to move forward with this, because I think it's in the best interest of public health, and it's in the best interest of the economy and it's in the best interest of the mental health of people who have to be quarantined," said William Schaffner, a professor of infectious disease at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center. "This is a win all around."


  Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, also welcomed the revision in the CDC guideline, saying it will focus on the period in which most people exposed to the virus are most likely to become contagious. Right now, she said, contact tracing efforts are hindered by "deep disincentives" for people to quarantine.


  "A seven- or 10-day quarantine recommendation may be easier for people to bear and hopefully may help get more contacts of cases to comply and better enable efforts to stop transmission of the virus," Nuzzo said Wednesday in an email.

Gurugram The police on Tuesday night arrested the owner of a car involved in a collision with a motorcycle that left the rider, a 49-year- old chief financial officer (CFO) of a private company, dead on August 23 in Cyber City. The car was allegedly driven by a minor, who was inebriated at the time of the incident.On Wednesday, the police also apprehended a juvenile who was a co-passenger in the car, under Section 304 (2) of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of Juvenile Justice Act. The police said he will undergo a test to determine his age and was produced before the Juvenile Justice Board. The car owner, identified as Dheeraj Taneja, has been booked under Section 109 (punishment for the offence for which there is no express provision made and the act is in consequence of the abetment by conspiracy) of the IPC and Section 77 (giving intoxicating liquor or narcotic drug or psychotropic substance to a child) of Juvenile Justice Act and was sent to judicial custody. On August 23, the victim, Alok Gupta, was on his way to Noida on his Harley Davidson motorcycle around 6am, when a Ford Figo, in which the two juveniles were allegedly travelling, rammed into the divider and hit his motorcycle across the carriageway. Gupta had succumbed to his injuries and the police had registered an FIR against the juvenile driver and owner of car, a friend of the driver's father, under sections 279 (rash driving or riding on a public way) and 304 A (death by negligence) of the IPC. According to the police, the juveniles had attended a party at Taneja's house and had allegedly consumed alcohol, after which they went out for a drive. The juvenile driving the car was apprehended earlier. KK Rao, the commissioner of police, said Taneja was arrested under non-bailable sections and the juvenile was sent to an observation home in Faridabad. "As per the earlier sections, the suspects were released on bail but after the investigation was reopened, the sections were added and they were arrested. We have taken legal opinion and all relevant sections have been added and all arrests have been made," he said. Mihika Wahi Gupta, the victim's wife, said she wants justice and also to spread awareness, to curb underage driving. "This accident is an eye-opener and the police should start booking parents and juvenile for underage driving. I am fighting for justice and will make sure the persons responsible for my husband's death are behind bars," she said. Earlier, the victim's family had approached the police commissioner over alleged negligence in the investigation and sought more stringent sections of the IPC. Gupta's family wanted the teenager who was at the wheel booked under Section 304(II) (rash or negligent act not amounting to culpable homicide) of the IPC instead of Section 304(a) which is 'negligence causing death'. Also, they wanted the owner of the car to be booked, following which sections 309 and 304(II) of the IPC and sections of JJ Act were added. On November 9, Rao suspended two policemen, including the station house officer (SHO) of DLF Phase 2 police station.The accident and the subsequent handling of the case by the police evoked widespread protests by the family and friends of the victim. On September 26, at least 400 people, including family members, friends and cyclists, carrying placards and banners, had taken out a solidarity march from DT Mega Mall to the crime spot, near DLF Phase 2 Rapid Metro station, demanding justice and action against those responsible. Similar protests were also held in Delhi, Noida, Nagpur, Lucknow, Indore and Jaipur.

What is Bibi’s message?


   _Mr. President-elect: This Mossad operation should tell you how seriously we view Iran’s determination to build a nuclear bomb, and how existential a threat that would be for us. And we intend to deal with that threat sooner rather than later._


   _And if, on taking office, you try to rejoin the Iran nuclear deal and lift U.S. sanctions in return for Iran’s full compliance with the terms of that deal, then we will not be restricted in the actions we take to prevent that from happening._


   _As President Trump put America first, we put Israel first, and Iran tops the list of threats we intend to face — preferably with you, but if necessary, alone._


  From Bibi’s standpoint, the killing of Iran’s top nuclear scientist seems to be a win-win-win proposition. Bibi’s personal scandals are eclipsed and put on the back burner. He is seen by Israelis as a man of action and decisive protector of the nation against its greatest threat.


  Should Iran answer the assassination with a counterstrike, that could lead to Israeli retaliation, escalation, and war. This could turn Bibi into a wartime prime minister like Winston Churchill and fulfill his dream of having America bring its full air, naval and missile power to deliver a crushing blow to the Iranian military and the Ayatollah’s regime.


  However, the assassination of Fakhrizadeh and Iran’s resolve to retaliate complicates — if it does not close — Biden’s path toward rejoining the nuclear deal and reconciling with Iran.


  If the killing ignites a war, Tehran knows there is a real possibility that America would align with Israel, as Donald Trump detests the Iranian regime as much as Netanyahu does.


  And if the “moderates” in Tehran fail to maintain the national honor by retaliating against Israel, that could result in a hardline regime winning in this year’s elections.


  A return of the hardliners could mean a total collapse of the Iran nuclear deal and a new cold war that could eventually end in the hot war Middle East hawks — in Iran, Israel and the USA — have long desired.


  As Trump showed with the assassination of Gen. Qasem Soleimani in his car coming out of Baghdad airport, he does not recoil from direct action against perceived enemies.


  Last week, the U.S. flew two B-52s out of Minot, North Dakota, to the Middle East. The USS Nimitz carrier group began moving out of the Indian Ocean toward the Persian Gulf.


  Four days before the hit on the Iranian scientist, Netanyahu met secretly in a Red Sea port city with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.


  Was Pompeo told what the Israelis were about to do? Did the U.S. know of, approve of, or not object to the attack? Do Americans want this war that seems closer today?

The solution to both problems is hydrogen, versatile enough to meet a variety of needs. It can be integrated into energy systems to provide an additional source of power when there are long gaps in wind supply. It can be generated on demand via green electrolysis or stored in tanks for later use, and it can be leveraged to keep heavy industry and centralized heating systems up and running when demand exceeds the supplies of renewable energy sources. Hydrogen can also be pumped directly into fuel-cell electric vehicles.

New Delhi The arrival of fruits and vegetables at Delhi's biggest agriculture produce market in Azadpur has dropped significantly since the farmers' blackade began at Delhi borders six days ago. The number of trucks reaching the market has reduced from around 11,500 a day -- the normal for this time of the year -- to around 6,000 trucks a day, said Adil Khan, chairperson of the agriculture produce market committee (APMC) in Azadpur.Several traders from the three prominent APMCs in Delhi - Azadpur, Ghazipur and Okhla - told HT that most traders have stopped sending fruits and vegetables to other states temporarily and have been focusing only on local supply as their stocks are limited. That, they said, has so far helped to keep wholesale and retail prices stable in Delhi."But traders are running out of stock. And, the arrivals are very low. So, a demand-supply gap will surface soon - probably in another three to four days -- if the borders remain blocked. Then, the prices will go up," said Anil Malhotra, a wholesale trader based in Azadpur.Traders in Ghazipur and Okhla echoed similar concerns regarding supply shortage and potential shoot-up in prices.Green peas, potatoes and some varieties of apples and oranges -- which largely arrive from the northern states through the border points of SInghu and Tikri, which are now blocked -- are some of the items that have witnessed the sharpest dip in arrivals across the three agriculture markets, the traders said.On Tuesday, HT had reported how trucks laden with goods are currently stranded on the Kondli highway with no place to go.Naveen Gupta, general secretary of the All India Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC) said the queue of trucks awaiting entry into Delhi at the Singhu border alone is as long as around 5 kilometres now."Entry of trucks into Delhi has almost come to a complete halt because of the ongoing protest. Though we do not have an exact number of trucks stuck at the borders, but it is safe to say that more than 1,500 trucks are stuck. Per day, the losses being faced by truck owners is around Rs 2,500 per truck, including taxes, cost of the driver and the loss in the number of trips. The problem is that because of the delay the clients are also likely to deduct money from their total payment," he said.

Robbie Fowler's comment on the perceived lack of training of some Indian players at SC East Bengal drew sharp reactions from former internationals Shyam Thapa and Subhas Bhowmick who have also coached the red- and-gold brigade. Following SC East Bengal's 0-3 loss to Mumbai City FC in ISL7 on Tuesday, coach Fowler said in a television interview, "in all honesty, some Indian players look like they haven't been coached before." In his first media interaction on October 10, the Liverpool great had said he was "more than satisfied" with the Indians on the roster. "The comment shows Robbie Fowler has some way to go before he can be called a good coach. You can say what you want to your players but behind the closed doors of the change room. In public, you defend them or say as a coach you couldn't communicate what you wanted," said Bhowmick who coached East Bengal to the 2003 Asean Cup title in Jakarta, making them the first Indian team to win a club competition outside south Asia. Before joining SC East Bengal, Fowler had been a player-manager in 2011-12 in Thailand and in A-League last term with Brisbane Roar. "And it shows that great players don't always make a good coach. Chuni (Goswami) and PK (Banerjee) got their coaching badges together but Chuni soon realised he wouldn't make a good coach even though he was arguably the best player of his generation, if not of all time in India," said Bhowmick. Former India captains, Goswami and Banerjee were among the country's best forwards and key members of the 1962 Asian Games team that won gold. Banerjee became a successful coach for clubs and country. "Fowler has been a great player so I think he couldn't control the frustration at the big loss. Losing 0-2 to ATK Mohun Bagan was different; they are a team formed from champions of I-League and ISL. So even though the loss hurt, he could control himself. Yesterday, he could not," said Thapa, chairman of the All India Football Federation's technical committee. "East Bengal couldn't deal with Mumbai's trio of Ahmed Jahouh, Rowllin Borges and Hugo Boumous. They were drawing East Bengal's midfield out and creating space and through the game, Fowler's team couldn't find a way to counter it. The defenders (Danny) Fox and (Scott) Neville should have done better against Mohun Bagan too. And I think Mike Okoro was better than (Jacques) Maghoma. So, the Indians may have been bad but what about the foreigners East Bengal have," said Bhowmick. Nigerian striker Okoro was a key member of East Bengal's national league titles in 2002-03 and 2003-04 under Bhowmick. That was the last time East Bengal won the national league. Bhowmick and Thapa, teammates in the 1970 Asian Games where India won bronze, agreed SC East Bengal have had an underwhelming start to their first ISL. They have lost both games, shipped five goals and looked disjointed. "That is not unexpected. By the time they joined ISL, teams had already recruited the best or retained them. Same for the imports too. They may be good but are not at their fittest. East Bengal will need time," said Thapa. Having joined on a two-year deal, Fowler had said that though SC East Bengal have had a shorter pre-season, they would be ready. "We will get it right. I am 100% sure of that," Fowler had said.

Creatives have been using Snap's Spectacles 3 to create music videos with augmented reality effects for a while, and the company is now moving into another filmmaking format. Snap teamed up with Los Angeles-based artist and community organizer Lauren Halsey for the first in a series of short films shot entirely with Spectacles 3.Halsey's four-minute film is called Summaeverythang -- it shares a name with Halsey's community center in South Central LA. The film depicts the day-to-day lives of Halsey and her team as they distribute boxes of produce to community members and create an art piece. There isn't too much of a focus on augmented reality, though there are some AR elements at the beginning and it ends with a stroll through an art installation with AR effects laid on top. Still, it's an intriguing look at how creators can use Spectacles 3 and augmented reality for their films.Snap also released a behind the scenes video for the documentary-style short. In it, Halsey discusses using AR to amplify her physical creations, and "how that can animate and energize what I've been making."

(AP) – The government has decided that when it comes to air travel, only dogs can be service animals, and companions used for emotional support don’t count.The Transportation Department issued a final rule Wednesday that aims to settle years of tension between airlines and passengers who bring their pets on board for free by saying they need them for emotional support.For years, the department required airlines to allow animals with passengers who had a doctor’s note saying they needed the animal for emotional support. Airlines believed passengers abused the rule to bring a menagerie of animals on board including cats, turtles, pigs and in one case, a peacock.The agency said Wednesday that it was rewriting the rules partly because passengers carrying unusual animals on board “eroded the public trust in legitimate service animals.” It also cited the increasing frequency of people “fraudulently representing their pets as service animals,” and a rise in misbehavior by emotional-support animals.The new rule will force passengers with emotional-support animals to check them into the cargo hold — and pay a pet fee — or leave them at home. The agency estimated airlines will gain up to $59.6 million a year in pet fees.Under the final rule, which takes effect in 30 days, a service animal is a dog trained to help a person with a physical or psychiatric disability. Advocates for veterans and others had pushed for inclusion of psychiatric service dogs.Airlines will be able to require owners to vouch for the dog’s health, behavior and training. Airlines can require people with a service dog to turn in paperwork up to 48 hours before a flight, but they can’t bar those travelers from checking in online like other passengers.Airlines can require that service dogs to be leashed at all times, and they can bar dogs that show aggressive behavior. There have been incidents of emotional-support animals biting passengers.The Transportation Department stood by an earlier decision to prohibit airlines from banning entire dog breeds. That is a setback for Delta Air Lines, which banned “pit bull type dogs” in 2018, a move that was criticized by disability advocates.Delta, however, is giving no indication of backing down. In a statement, a Delta spokeswoman said the airline is reviewing the new rule but, “At this time, there are no changes to Delta’s current service and support animal policies.”Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

Lacy remembers having doubts about applying for positions like brigade commander when she was a midshipman. Now an active-duty Navy captain, she said she learned “not to self-eliminate.”


  “Those were the words that I used when I talked to her, and I did tell her to reach for the stars and not to sell herself short," said Lacy, who is now legislative director for the Office of the Chief of Navy Reserve.


  Barber, who aspires to be commissioned as a Marine Corps ground officer, will be the 16th woman to be brigade commander at the academy. The first, Juliane Gallina, held the position in 1991.


  Similar ground was broken at the U.S. Military Academy in New York in 2017, when Simone Askew became the first Black female first captain, the highest position in the cadet chain of command at West Point.


  Women were first allowed into the nation’s service academies in 1976. That’s also when Janie Mines became the first Black woman to enter the Naval Academy, graduating four years later in 1980. While the number of women at the academy has been rising, it's still currently about 72% male and 28% female.


  In a social media post, Mines wrote that Barber's selection “brought me to tears. This young woman, Midshipman Sydney Barber, will be the first Black Female Brigade Commander at the U.S. Naval Academy. 40 years later. Thank you, Sydney! Love you!"

Alexander told his colleagues, including more junior, impatient Democrats who boasted they would get rid of the filibuster if Democrats retake the chamber, that taking such a step would ruin the Senate.                                    “Ending the filibuster would destroy the impetus for forcing the broad agreements I've been talking about and it would unleash the tyranny of the majority to steamroll the rights of the minority," Alexander said.

May 5, 1924 - November 27, 2020


  Gloria Joyce (Wittwer) Stresky passed away peacefully at her home on November 27, 2020. She was 96.


  Gloria was born May 5, 1924, to Swiss parents, Gottlieb and Minnae (Minnie), in Monticello, Wisconsin. Orphaned as young girls, she and her sister, Charlene, were raised on a family farm outside Madison.


  After graduating from Albany High School in 1942, she attended the Groves- Barnhart Secretarial School in Madison, from which she was assigned a coveted position as assistant to the director of the War Production Board in Washington D.C. until the end of World War II. Prior to moving to D.C., she met James Werner Stresky (Jim) -- who was stationed at the Great Lakes Naval Training Station near Chicago -- at a Methodist dance for soldiers. That brief meeting spawned letter-writing throughout the war while he served as Radioman First Class aboard the USS Shea in the Pacific Theater.


  While in D.C., Gloria worked on the top-secret Manhattan Project, a title for which was commonly known but not for its ultimate purpose. She managed paper files, many of which had connections to Los Alamos, New Mexico, that were passed from person-to-person to maintain security protocol, then tucked inside a large vault, the combination to which was written in the back of Gloria’s stenotype book.


  After the end of the war, Gloria worked at the State Department until the birth of her daughter, Patricia, in 1947. Her proud legacy from her war efforts created profound, heartfelt memories and patriotism that lasted for the rest of her life.


  Gloria and Jim married on January 31, 1946, and lived in D.C. until the fall of 1951, when fate changed the course of their lives. Hearing about a rare opportunity for a court reporter in Wyoming, Jim flew to Sheridan, interviewed with the judges (who’d never seen a stenotype before), then immediately flew back to D.C. to tell Gloria he’d been hired on the spot. Pregnant with Mary Jo, who’d be born the following March, she asked, “Where’s Wyoming?” while frantically packing for their new adventures. Over the years, Jim and Gloria often recalled arriving atop Jim Creek Hill at sunset, in awe of the stunning panorama of the valley that was now their home.


  In 1956, they purchased their home on Bighorn Avenue, where she resided until her death. Their son, Steve, was born in 1957. In addition to tending to the needs of her family, she utilized her superior typing skills on a manual typewriter to produce multiple carbon paper copies of courtroom transcripts for Jim.


  Shortly upon arriving in Sheridan, Gloria and Jim joined the First Presbyterian Church, which became a solid foundation for their lives and spirituality. Gloria taught Sunday school at the old gothic church on South Main, then at the “new” church on Colonial Drive. She also served on the Session, the financial committee, the Woman’s Circle, and as an elder. Decades of her family singing in the choir, the children wearing angel wings in Christmas pageants, listening to the pipe organ melodies resonating throughout the church, greeting folks at the door to church service, and serving post- service coffee and cookies are just a few of the warm memories she carried in her heart. Her church life fostered fellowship, community, devotion, comradery and purpose.


  People often stopped to gaze at all the different varietals in Gloria’s spectacular rose garden. An avid reader, she’d often finish an entire book in a single sitting. A serious competitor, she looked forward to playing Scrabble, poker and trivia games with her family.


  Gloria’s advice to her loved ones was to “Be loving and committed to God, your family and friends, for you never know when there will be another sunrise.”


  Gloria is preceded in death by her parents, her sister Charlene, and her husband James. She is survived by her children, Mary Jo and Steven of Sheridan, and Patricia (Judy) of Long Beach, California, along with several nephews and nieces from both the Wittwer and Stresky clans.


  No funeral services are pending at this time. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the Gloria Stresky Memorial Fund at the First Presbyterian Church, 2121 Colonial Drive, Sheridan.

The full scale of the Toon Coronavirus crisis has not been made public, which to a degree is understandable given that it's personal health issues we're talking about.


  But we know the virus has hit several first team players and has been severe enough to cause the Magpies training ground at Benton to be completely shut down with all football and admin staff sent home.


  Newcastle have not practiced since last Thursday and for all the gags about Richie De Laet's damning assessemment of Bruce's training sessions during their time at Villa, it is clearly far from ideal preparation for the Toon squad.


  The Premier League agreed and, crucially, so too did Aston Villa.


  Bruce and Co should be very grateful indeed that they haven't been made to forfeit the game and hand three points on a little dishy to Villa.


  Because it's the first instance of its kind in the English top flight, there's been no Premier League precedent - until now.


  But it was more black and white in Italy where Juventus were awarded a 3-0 Serie A victory after Napoli were unable to fulfil a fixture following an outbreak of their own last month.


  Even on these shores, the Leyton Orient owner Nigel Travis was left bemoaning the injustice after the League Two club were struck by cases, giving Tottenham Hotspur a bye to the Carabao Cup fourth round. in late September.


  Yet due to Villa's Magpies magnanimity - or other reasons as yet undisclosed - Newcastle were allowed to kick this fixture down the road.


  "Aston Villa can confirm that the Club fully supports the Premier League’s decision to postpone our fixture with Newcastle United on Friday following a significant COVID outbreak at the Tyneside club and the shutdown of their training ground by Public Health England," explained Villa in a statement.

  "David was one of the best passers I think I've ever seen," McMenemy told ChronicleLive. "In training, he hardly ever gave the ball away and in games, he was very clever in possession and put his foot in as well. He had that little bit of aggression about him that everyone liked.


  "He was a really good professional. Literally one of those that came in, wanted to work hard and wanted to play the game a certain way, which was our style of play, and then just go home to his family. He wasn't anything other than that.


  "I remember we were sponsored at the time by Rover for the club cars and when the allocation came in, he wasn't bothered at all. He just said, 'Give me the diesel estate. I just want to go up and down to my house as quick as possible'. He was just a pleasure to work with in every sense."

Nearly 200 students will participate in Chaffey College’s first “drive-in” commencement on Dec. 4.


  Students, faculty, administrators and the Governing Board will be in full regalia for the historic event, which will take place at Chaffey’s Rancho Cucamonga campus stadium parking lot.


  At least 190 students have signed up to participate, and to ensure social distancing, they will be involved in two ceremonies taking place at 10 a.m. and 2 p.m.


  Chaffey’s annual commencement normally takes place at Toyota Arena in Ontario, but that ceremony was postponed due to COVID-19.


  “We look forward to seeing thousands of proud family members and graduates every year at Toyota Arena for commencement, but the pandemic had other plans for us this year,” said Chaffey College Superintendent/President Henry Shannon. “While county and state health regulations dictate that we cannot gather in such large numbers, we recognize the importance of this moment in our students’ lives, so we want to honor them as best we can with an official ceremony.”


  Speakers will include Shannon, student class speakers, Chaffey College Faculty Senate President Nicole DeRose and Children’s Fund President and CEO Ciriaco “Cid” Pinedo as keynote speaker. Students will be invited to step out and stand next to their cars as names of graduates are called.


  To comply with San Bernardino County health guidelines, graduates and all guests will be required to wear face masks while on campus.

Restaurant-level adjusted margin, an important financial metric that gives an indication about the company’s health, expanded 280 basis points (bps) in the fiscal fourth quarter from the year-ago quarter’s 27%. The upside was backed by improvements in labor costs, and food and packaging costs. Notably, labor costs improved by 120 bps, on the back of sales leverage, partially offset by approximately 6 percent wage inflation. While, food and packaging costs (as a percentage of company restaurant sales) decreased 100 bps due to menu price increases and positive mix shift. However, this was partially offset by higher ingredient costs.

It's not the first time something like this has been developed. Silent speech interfaces have been around for a few years, but there's still plenty of room for improvement when it comes to the performance of these devices. This is where the new approach comes in with an innovation: the AI algorithm transfers audio outputs "from vocalized recordings to silent recordings of the same utterances." In other words, this is the first model that trains the algorithm with EMG data collected during silent speech, not 'real' speech. This approach offers better performance, the researchers note in the study.

Even though Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) related apprehensions regarding shared mobility platforms will keep annual vehicle miles traveled and hence aftermarket revenues subdued in the short run, revenues from servicing and repair of new mobility vehicles are estimated to be restored to pre COVID-19 levels by 2021.      A latest development is the announcement by a prominent market player to embark on an aggressive fleet electrification agenda by the end of the forecast period. This will catalyze an industry-wide shift towards cleaner powertrains and consequently impact the revenue potential from maintenance as spares stocking and manpower expertise requirements vary significantly between powertrain types. Revenues from IC engines as a proportion of total accruable revenues could reduce by more than half of the initial estimates by 2030 if this scenario is to pan out.

Robbie Fowler's comment on the perceived lack of training of some Indian players at SC East Bengal drew sharp reactions from former internationals Shyam Thapa and Subhas Bhowmick who have also coached the red-and-gold brigade.


  Following SC East Bengal's 0-3 loss to Mumbai City FC in ISL7 on Tuesday, coach Fowler said in a television interview, "in all honesty, some Indian players look like they haven't been coached before." In his first media interaction on October 10, the Liverpool great had said he was "more than satisfied" with the Indians on the roster.


  "The comment shows Robbie Fowler has some way to go before he can be called a good coach. You can say what you want to your players but behind the closed doors of the change room. In public, you defend them or say as a coach you couldn't communicate what you wanted," said Bhowmick who coached East Bengal to the 2003 Asean Cup title in Jakarta, making them the first Indian team to win a club competition outside south Asia.


  Before joining SC East Bengal, Fowler had been a player-manager in 2011-12 in Thailand and in A-League last term with Brisbane Roar.


   


   


  "And it shows that great players don't always make a good coach. Chuni (Goswami) and PK (Banerjee) got their coaching badges together but Chuni soon realised he wouldn't make a good coach even though he was arguably the best player of his generation, if not of all time in India," said Bhowmick.


  Former India captains, Goswami and Banerjee were among the country's best forwards and key members of the 1962 Asian Games team that won gold. Banerjee became a successful coach for clubs and country.


  "Fowler has been a great player so I think he couldn't control the frustration at the big loss. Losing 0-2 to ATK Mohun Bagan was different; they are a team formed from champions of I-League and ISL. So even though the loss hurt, he could control himself. Yesterday, he could not," said Thapa, chairman of the All India Football Federation's technical committee.


  "East Bengal couldn't deal with Mumbai's trio of Ahmed Jahouh, Rowllin Borges and Hugo Boumous. They were drawing East Bengal's midfield out and creating space and through the game, Fowler's team couldn't find a way to counter it. The defenders (Danny) Fox and (Scott) Neville should have done better against Mohun Bagan too. And I think Mike Okoro was better than (Jacques) Maghoma. So, the Indians may have been bad but what about the foreigners East Bengal have," said Bhowmick.


  Nigerian striker Okoro was a key member of East Bengal's national league titles in 2002-03 and 2003-04 under Bhowmick. That was the last time East Bengal won the national league.


  Bhowmick and Thapa, teammates in the 1970 Asian Games where India won bronze, agreed SC East Bengal have had an underwhelming start to their first ISL. They have lost both games, shipped five goals and looked disjointed. "That is not unexpected. By the time they joined ISL, teams had already recruited the best or retained them. Same for the imports too. They may be good but are not at their fittest. East Bengal will need time," said Thapa.


  Having joined on a two-year deal, Fowler had said that though SC East Bengal have had a shorter pre-season, they would be ready. "We will get it right. I am 100% sure of that," Fowler had said.

"In Norway, it's very in your face, it's on the TV and the radio, and the papers. It's a challenge, but I'm used to it by now," she said.


  The princess is determined to keep speaking about the subject -- not just for Verrett, but for the Norwegian people, some of which have had to change their names in order to get a job due to racism, according to Martha Louise.


  "We have to start getting out of the 1700s and updating ourselves. We are one human race," she said.

The quarantine can end after 10 days without a test if a person monitors potential symptoms, such as fever, on a daily basis and has none. The exposed person is expected to continue monitoring symptoms and wearing a mask for the full 14 days despite discontinuing quarantine.                                     The CDC was looking for "the sweet spot," the federal official said, where the recommended quarantine would capture the majority of potentially infectious people but also lead to higher compliance. CDC scientists calculated that, for people discontinuing quarantine after seven days, the "residual post-quarantine transmission risk" is about 5%, dropping to 1% for those who quarantine for 10 days under the new guidance.                                    Two prominent infectious-disease experts welcomed the news of the revised guidance Wednesday.                                     "Behind the scenes, many of us had been urging the CDC to move forward with this, because I think it's in the best interest of public health, and it's in the best interest of the economy and it's in the best interest of the mental health of people who have to be quarantined," said William Schaffner, a professor of infectious disease at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center. "This is a win all around."                                    Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, also welcomed the revision in the CDC guideline, saying it will focus on the period in which most people exposed to the virus are most likely to become contagious. Right now, she said, contact tracing efforts are hindered by "deep disincentives" for people to quarantine.                                     "A seven- or 10-day quarantine recommendation may be easier for people to bear and hopefully may help get more contacts of cases to comply and better enable efforts to stop transmission of the virus," Nuzzo said Wednesday in an email.
