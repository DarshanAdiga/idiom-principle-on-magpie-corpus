 LAUSANA, Suiza (AP) — El Comité Olímpico Internacional (COI) tendrá hasta cuatro semanas para decidir si pospone los Juegos Olímpicos de Tokio en medio de crecientes críticas por la manera en que hace frente a la pandemia del coronavirus y el domingo se sumó un llamado del líder de la federación de atletismo, el deporte más importante en la justa mundial.
 El COI planea reunirse con las autoridades de Japón, funcionarios del deporte internacional, medios con derechos de transmisión y patrocinadores para abordar la planeación de un escenario para los Juegos Olímpicos, previstos para realizarse del 24 de julio al 9 de agosto, indicó el COI. La cancelación de los Juegos no está bajo consideración.
 El presidente del COI, Thomas Bach, envió una carta a los deportistas en la cual explica la decisión y el motivo por el que tomaría tanto tiempo tomarla, al tiempo que reconoció que ese largo periodo de cuatro semanas podría no ser del agrado de todos.
 “Comprendo que esta situación sin precedentes no responde muchas de sus preguntas”, escribió. “También sé que este enfoque racional quizá no se ajuste a las emociones por las que muchos de ustedes están pasando”.
 No obstante, el Comité Olímpico Canadiense anunció por la noche que no enviaría una delegación de deportistas a los Juegos a menos que éstos sean pospuestos un año, convirtiéndose en el primer país en amenazar con ausentarse de la justa mundial a raíz de la propagación del COVID-19.
 Por medio de un comunicado, el comité canadiense se dijo dispuesto a colaborar con el COI para encontrar soluciones alternas, pero que el pretender mantener las fechas actuales no era seguro para los deportistas, “sus familias y la más amplia comunidad de deportistas canadienses que siguen entrenando para estos Juegos”.
 El Comité añadió que el intento del COI de realizar los Juegos “de hecho va en contra de los consejos de salud pública que hemos exhortado a todos los canadienses a seguir”.
 Canadá participó en los Juegos Olímpicos de Río de Janeiro con una delegación de 314 deportistas que se colgaron un total de 22 medallas en 2016.
 Canadá se suma a un creciente número de países, entre ellos Noruega, Brasil y Eslovenia, que han presionado al COI para que aplace los Juegos de Tokio _aunque ninguno antes había advertido que no participaría en caso de que la justa no modifique su calendario de competencias.
 La mayoría de los infectados sufren síntomas de leves a moderados, como fiebre y tos, y se recuperan en cuestión de semanas, pero el virus es altamente contagioso puede propagarse a través de personas que no muestren síntomas. Además, puede derivar en enfermedades graves, como neumonía, especialmente en adultos mayores o pacientes con enfermedades previas. La gran mayoría se recupera.
 En todo el mundo, más de 316.000 personas se han infectado y casi 13.600 han muerto, según un conteo de la Universidad Johns Hopkins.
 Por su parte, el primer ministro japonés Shinzo Abe dijo que posponer los Juegos de Tokio sería inevitable en caso de que el evento no pueda realizarse por completo debido al impacto del coronavirus.
 Abe habló durante una sesión del parlamento japonés sobre el plan del COI de evaluar la situación en las próximas semanas y tomar una decisión, la cual podría incluir un aplazamiento. Sin embargo, el primer ministro descartó la posibilidad de cancelar los Juegos de Tokio.
 La llama olímpica llegó el viernes al norte de Japón, desde donde iniciará su marcha con relevo el 26 de marzo, si bien las autoridades han señalado que el acceso a la ruta de la antorcha será controlado y los eventos en torno a su recorrido serán realizados a baja escala.
 Hasta el domingo, Japón había confirmado 1.719 casos del virus, incluyendo 712 de un crucero, y un total de 43 decesos.
 Si bien Japón ha logrado hasta ahora frenar la propagación de la enfermedad, los expertos aseguran que han detectado un creciente número de áreas urbanas con infecciones indetectables.
 Pocas horas después del anuncio del COI, el presidente de World Athletics _órgano rector del atletismo a nivel mundial_, Sebastian Coe, mandó una misiva a Bach en la que señaló que realizar los Juegos Olímpicos en julio “no es ni factible ni deseable”. Coe subrayó varios motivos, incluyendo la imparcialidad competitiva, la probabilidad de que los deportistas entrenen de más ante un calendario de competencia reducido y la incertidumbre causada por las órdenes de muchos gobiernos de cerrar gimnasios y otras instalaciones para ejercitarse.
 “Nadie desea que los Juegos Olímpicos sean pospuestos, pero... no podemos llevar a cabo el evento a toda costa, seguramente no a costa de la seguridad de los deportistas”, sostuvo. “Una decisión respecto a los Juegos Olímpicos podría resultar muy obvia en poco tiempo”.
 Sin embargo, tal decisión no podría tomarse en menos de un mes.
 El COI detalló que los escenarios que están siendo considerados “se relacionan con la modificación de planes operacionales existentes para que los Juegos empiecen el 24 de julio de 2020 y también para cambios a la fecha de inicio de los Juegos”.
 El cambio de estrategia se da luego que Bach sostuvo una conferencia telefónica con integrantes de la mesa directiva.
 Bach ha dicho constantemente que los organizadores están comprometidos de lleno a iniciar la justa el 24 de julio _a pesar de que los entrenamientos de los deportistas, eventos de clasificación y la preparación de los Juegos en Tokio son afectados cada vez más por el brote del nuevo coronavirus.
 Las críticas sobre esta postura han aumentado en los últimos días por parte de medallistas de oro olímpicos y por un integrante del COI el pasado martes, antes que Bach finalmente reconociera que es posible un plan alterno.
 Los comités olímpicos de Brasil y Eslovenia posteriormente pidieron que los Juegos Olímpicos fueran pospuestos hasta 2021. El organismo que rige el deporte olímpico de Noruega señaló que no quería que los atletas acudan a Tokio hasta que la crisis sanitaria global esté bajo control.
 Las federaciones estadounidenses de atletismo y natación _dos de los tres deportes más importantes de los Juegos Olímpicos_ exhortaron al Comité Olímpico de Estados Unidos a solicitar el aplazamiento de las competencias.
 “Hay un incremento drástico de casos y nuevos brotes de la enfermedad COVID-19 en distintos países de todos los continentes”, aseveró el COI. “Esto llevó a (la junta) a la conclusión de que el COI necesita tomar el siguiente paso en la planeación de un escenario alterno”.
 El COI informó la semana pasada que alrededor de 4.700 de los 11.000 lugares disponibles en los Juegos Olímpicos aun deben ser otorgados por medio de eventos clasificatorios.
 Bach reconoció que un calendario reducido o radicalmente alterado para esos eventos podría generar problemas, pero también planteó varias razones por las que el COI no debería apresurarse a tomar una decisión.
 Entre los motivos subrayó la disponibilidad de las sedes que están programadas para ser usadas a mediados de este año pero que no podrían estar disponibles en fechas posteriores y la alteración de competencias futuras de distintos deportes.
 “El tomar hoy una decisión sobre una postergación no podría determinar una nueva fecha para los Juegos Olímpicos ante la incertidumbre de los sucesos en ambas direcciones: una mejora, como lo estamos viendo en varios países gracias a las severas medidas que se están tomando, o una situación de deterioro en otros países”, dijo Bach.
 “Las vidas humanas tienen prioridad sobre todas las cosas, incluida la realización de los juegos”, escribió Bach. “El COI quiere ser parte de la solución”.
 Cualquier aplazamiento de los Juegos Olímpicos repercutiría en los Paralímpicos que estaban programados para llevarse a cabo del 25 de agosto al 6 de septiembre, igual en Tokio.
 Por su parte, el Comité Paralímpico Internacional (CPI) declaró que “como pueden imaginar, el potencial cambio de fecha de los Juegos Olímpicos y Paralímpicos es un enorme desafío logístico y el CPI apoyará al COI en cada momento”.
 “Actualmente es de suma importancia que todos, incluidos los atletas, se queden en casa para ayudar a frenar la propagación de esta terrible enfermedad que está impactando a la comunidad internacional”, añadió el CPI, con sede en Alemania.

But she had to put it away and take care of those who were around her. So to have that reawakened… the only way she could go [after Rick] was with Judith's urging and permission.

There's not much that stops Pueblo dog owners from venturing out to City Park.
   
 Not snow. Not rain. Not even the threat of COVID-19.
   
 I'm not judging. I know what it's like to wake up to a canine companion bouncing off the walls. When a dog's made up its mind, there's no denying its will. In my case, there's no chance of withstanding the guilt imposed by my labradoodle's begging eyes.
   
 I can't blame Puebloans for soaking up a little sun while maintaining social distancing. As of Saturday, exemptions from Colorado's ban on groups of 10 people or more include airports, buses, train stations, health care facilities, retail stores and pharmacies. Those aren't exactly the perfect places to play fetch with Fido.
   
 So, it's no surprise that dog owners trickled into City Park this weekend among the joggers, tennis players and other outdoor enthusiasts. Many dog owners practiced self-isolation by sticking to benches and other landscape fixtures far away from each other. There seemed to be less than 10 people at a time, though perhaps more than 10 dogs. I don't think there's a ban on that -- yet.
   
 For about two weeks, communal water dishes have been disappearing. Recently, a sign went up announcing that they're prohibited. If it's not related to coronavirus panic, the timing is peculiar. New signs at the restrooms remind guests to wash their hands.
   
 Now, the huddle of retirees with big dogs who usually gather early under the canopied bench instead mill around restlessly before giving up and leaving.
   
 For some, these are the dog days of the dog days.
   
 This weekend, as pooch handlers wove around each other and exchanged pleasantries, many disclosed tidbits about how they've been spending extra time at home.
   
 A man with a Brazilian mastiff finished renovating his downstairs bathroom and building a four-wheeler in less than a week. He's intrigued with the state now allowing alcoholic beverages to be sold with takeout food orders.
   
 A woman with a 20-year-old rescue -- which still mingles with my young labradoodle and the even-younger mastiff -- repainted the inside of her house. She says she's out of fabric to sew, but there's no local retailers open. A trip to Walmart? Not with this weekend's hordes of shoppers, she said. Because I've often seen her demonstrate generosity with other dog folks, I almost offered her some long curtain panels I have stashed somewhere in my house. But after I heard that she designs garments, I figure I'll wait until she reaches Scarlett O'Hara-level desperation.
   
 Though schools and jobs have come to a halt, and many shelves at the grocery store might be bare, it's mindful company like this that assures me Pueblo will prevail.
   
 There's something fascinating about Puebloans that goes beyond civic pride; it's a sense of purpose. When we're not occupied helping others, we're still making good use of our time. The city's most-celebrated icons -- the slopper, the Pueblo Chile, the mill, among others -- can't say enough about our zest for life, grit and passion.
   
 Nothing stops the Pueblo hustle. Volunteers keep serving the needy. A business that spans generations bucks challenges with innovation. Local merchants keep us fed. Caregivers don't panic under pressure. Even after floods, bomb cyclones and ebbs in the economy, Pueblo has rebounded throughout the centuries.
   
 The Steel City won't allow itself to go unpolished.
   
 Ricardo Lopez Jr. is city editor of The Pueblo Chieftain.

Files are then taken to the judge for approval or denial. If approved, the nonviolent inmates are released pending their court date. There are different levels of supervision with the pretrial program as well. Some are simply required to call in and speak with a pretrial officer and the level of supervision goes on up to requiring those released to wear a GPS ankle monitor and report to the Sullivan County Jail in person each week."

Some states have as few as one drive-thru site. Montana’s sole site is in Billings, the state’s largest city. Others have a few dozen.
 Security guards were reported at many sites, but a survey of states by the AP did not uncover any security problems. In Rhode Island, the National Guard have been on hand to set up the state’s three drive-thru sites and even to swab patients.
 The vast network of drive-thru sites at retail chains that Trump said more than a week ago was coming has so far failed to materialize. CVS has opened one site in Massachusetts, which it calls a “model for testing.” Walmart launched two sites Sunday, and Walgreens said it's launching one, all three in Illinois. Only health care workers and first responders are allowed, and Walmart said a maximum 150 tests per day could be performed at its federal sites.
 The patchwork of approaches has caused confusion for patients. Caroline Mauldin was ordered to get a test by her doctor in Charleston, South Carolina, on Tuesday, after experiencing aches and chills for several days.
 To get an appointment at a drive-thru site at a medical center, she had to fill out a lengthy online questionnaire and she spent two days calling a number that rolled to voicemail and wouldn't take messages. She resorted to tweeting at the hospital several times just to move things forward.
 Finally, on Thursday, she got an appointment for Monday. And she was told the results would not come back until four to five days after that. The visit will cost her $25, she said. Complicating matters, she doesn’t have a car and has to borrow one from a friend.
 “We have a lot of elderly, low-income people here who don't have access to the internet and who don't have access to transportation. And given that they're the highest risk population, how are we getting tests to them?” she asked.
 In urban area such as New York and Philadelphia, some sites are providing "walk-up" appointments for people with no cars.
 At the Penn Medicine testing site in West Philadelphia, two security officers late Thursday stood outside to make sure people who arrived by car or foot had an appointment. For about 40 minutes that evening, the line of cars never grew to more than six or seven. But Patricia Sullivan, chief quality officer of Penn Medicine, said every morning this past week, 25 to 35 cars have been lined up and six or seven walk-up patients have stood 6 feet apart under a portico waiting to be seen.
 The 20 sites in greater Philadelphia are testing about 1,000 people a day, but that hasn't cleared the pent-up demand.
 Rosanne Tanner’s 79-year-old mother has been sick with a fever and chest pain since returning from visiting Tanner’s brother and his wife, who had recently been on a cruise ship.
 Her doctor ordered a test on Tuesday, but when she tried to get an appointment at a drive-thru site at a hospital outside Philadelphia, they were told “they are overloaded, they’re bogged down,” Tanner said.
 Medical staff told her they're scheduling 15 minutes apart so there aren’t bottlenecks at the test site.
 Finally on Thursday her mother secured an appointment for the following Tuesday. Then, she will have to wait five more days for a result.
 “The lag time on these tests, it’s putting people at risk,” Tanner said.
 In Rhode Island, state officials said they are testing around 100 to 200 people a day at all testing sites, including three drive-thrus.
 Gov. Gina Raimondo said they want to perform 500 to 600 per day, but they don’t have the supplies they need.
 “It is our absolute top priority to get to a place where everyone who needs it can be tested and you’ll get the results very quickly," Raimondo said at a news conference held via Facebook Live on Friday. "Then if you’re positive, we can get you quarantined.”

Penn Medicine is working overtime to open part of its new hospital, with 119 beds, to deal with patients suffering from the novel coronavirus COVID-19.
 “Crews are working around the clock to complete this project at an incredible pace – these rooms are expected to be ready by mid-April, 15 months ahead of the facility’s planned opening,” the spokesperson said in a statement.
 The spokesperson said Penn Medicine has been “working closely” with Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf's office and the Philadelphia Building and Construction Trades Council to expedite construction while ensuring the safety of workers.
 Earlier in the week, Wolf ordered all “nonessential businesses” to close across the state, including construction companies. However, Philadelphia officials shortly thereafter said they would work with the governor to keep construction going, at least temporarily, referencing their desire to continue building at a hospital in the city.
 It was unclear if the hospital they were referring to was the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania.

 There's not much that stops Pueblo dog owners from venturing out to City Park.
 Not snow. Not rain. Not even the threat of COVID-19.
 I'm not judging. I know what it's like to wake up to a canine companion bouncing off the walls. When a dog's made up its mind, there's no denying its will. In my case, there's no chance of withstanding the guilt imposed by my labradoodle's begging eyes.
 I can't blame Puebloans for soaking up a little sun while maintaining social distancing. As of Saturday, exemptions from Colorado's ban on groups of 10 people or more include airports, buses, train stations, health care facilities, retail stores and pharmacies. Those aren't exactly the perfect places to play fetch with Fido.
 So, it's no surprise that dog owners trickled into City Park this weekend among the joggers, tennis players and other outdoor enthusiasts. Many dog owners practiced self-isolation by sticking to benches and other landscape fixtures far away from each other. There seemed to be less than 10 people at a time, though perhaps more than 10 dogs. I don't think there's a ban on that -- yet.
 For about two weeks, communal water dishes have been disappearing. Recently, a sign went up announcing that they're prohibited. If it's not related to coronavirus panic, the timing is peculiar. New signs at the restrooms remind guests to wash their hands.
 Now, the huddle of retirees with big dogs who usually gather early under the canopied bench instead mill around restlessly before giving up and leaving.
 For some, these are the dog days of the dog days.
 This weekend, as pooch handlers wove around each other and exchanged pleasantries, many disclosed tidbits about how they've been spending extra time at home.
 A man with a Brazilian mastiff finished renovating his downstairs bathroom and building a four-wheeler in less than a week. He's intrigued with the state now allowing alcoholic beverages to be sold with takeout food orders.
 A woman with a 20-year-old rescue -- which still mingles with my young labradoodle and the even-younger mastiff -- repainted the inside of her house. She says she's out of fabric to sew, but there's no local retailers open. A trip to Walmart? Not with this weekend's hordes of shoppers, she said. Because I've often seen her demonstrate generosity with other dog folks, I almost offered her some long curtain panels I have stashed somewhere in my house. But after I heard that she designs garments, I figure I'll wait until she reaches Scarlett O'Hara-level desperation.
 Though schools and jobs have come to a halt, and many shelves at the grocery store might be bare, it's mindful company like this that assures me Pueblo will prevail.
 There's something fascinating about Puebloans that goes beyond civic pride; it's a sense of purpose. When we're not occupied helping others, we're still making good use of our time. The city's most-celebrated icons -- the slopper, the Pueblo Chile, the mill, among others -- can't say enough about our zest for life, grit and passion.
 Nothing stops the Pueblo hustle. Volunteers keep serving the needy. A business that spans generations bucks challenges with innovation. Local merchants keep us fed. Caregivers don't panic under pressure. Even after floods, bomb cyclones and ebbs in the economy, Pueblo has rebounded throughout the centuries.
 The Steel City won't allow itself to go unpolished.

PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — Drive-thru sites have been opening around the United States to make it quicker and safer to test people for the new coronavirus. But much like the rest of the U.S. response to the pandemic, the system has been marked by inconsistencies, delays, and shortages. Many people who have symptoms and a doctor’s order have waited hours or days for a test.
 More than a week after President Donald Trump promised that states and retail stores such as Walmart and CVS would open drive-thru test centers, few sites are up and running, and they're not yet open to the general public. Some states are leaving it to the private sector to open test locations; others are coordinating the effort through state health departments.
 Patients have complained that they had to jump through cumbersome bureaucratic hoops and wait days to get tested, then wait even longer for a result. Testing centers opened in some places only to be shut down shortly afterward because of shortages of supplies and staff. And while the drive-thru test centers that have opened are generally orderly, there have been long lines at some.

We’ll have to touch base on that later. But wherever Michonne's going, she’s determined to find him. That’s now her mission. It’s always been her hunch [that he's alive], and she finally let it go, last season in the flashback. She and Daryl always had that hunch. Something didn’t make sense. But she had to put it away and take care of those who were around her. So to have that reawakened… the only way she could go [after Rick] was with Judith’s urging and permission. Whatever happens, she’s going to give it her all. But because of her evolution, she makes the same decision [that she had with Andrea,] to help people, to an extent expressing her humanity to the inconvenience of her own aspirations. That’s the woman that she’s become, and I was happy that that was the woman she got to exit being.

We have never experienced something like this before, and it’s so hard to process something that has the power to fundamentally change every aspect of our lives in the blink of an eye. All we can do is wash our hands, stay inside, and try to ride out this pandemic one day at a time.
