NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. health officials Wednesday redefined what counts as close contact with someone with COVID-19 to include briefer but repeated encounters.For months, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said close contact meant spending a solid 15 minutes within 6 feet of someone who tested positive for coronavirus. On Wednesday, the CDC changed it to a total of 15 minutes or more — so shorter but repeated contacts that add up to 15 minutes over a 24-hour period now count.The CDC advises anyone who has been in close contact with a COVID-19 patient to quarantine for two weeks.The change may prompt health departments to do contact tracing in cases where an exposure might previously have been considered too brief, said Dr. William Schaffner, a Vanderbilt University infectious diseases expert.It’s also serves notice that the coronavirus can spread more easily than many people realize, he added.The definition change was triggered by a study of a 20-year-old Vermont correctional officer, who was diagnosed with a coronavirus infection in August. The guard, who wore a mask and goggles, had multiple brief encounters with six transferred prisoners before test results showed they were positive. At times, the prisoners wore masks, but there were encounters in cell doorways or in a recreational room where prisoners did not have them on, the report said.An investigation that reviewed video footage concluded the guard’s brief interactions totaled 17 minutes during an 8-hour shift.In a statement, CDC officials said the case highlights again the importance of wearing masks to prevent transmission.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

Multiple vaccine candidates are in final-stage studies in tens of thousands of adults, and scientists are hopeful that the next few months will bring evidence that at least some of them are safe and effective enough for widespread use.
 But when the first shots arrive, they’re unlikely to be recommended for children. Vaccines can’t be given to youngsters unless they’ve been tested in their age group -- a major hurdle in efforts to reopen schools and resume more normal activities that are critical to families' well-being.
 “The public doesn’t understand that,” said Dr. Evan Anderson of Emory University, who has been pushing for pediatric testing of COVID-19 vaccines. While he’s encouraged by Pfizer’s study in adolescents, he finds it “very concerning” that children younger than 12 may not have a vaccine by next fall.
 Children represent about 10% of COVID-19 cases documented in the U.S. And while children are far less likely than adults to get seriously ill, about 120 have died in the U.S. alone, according to a tally by the American Academy of Pediatrics. That’s about how many U.S. children die from flu in an average year. Additionally, a small number have developed a serious inflammatory condition linked to the coronavirus.
 Overall, Anderson says COVID-19′s impact on children is greater than some other diseases that require routine pediatric vaccinations.
 Aside from their own health risks is the still unanswered question about how easily children can infect others. In a letter to federal health officials, the AAP cited recent evidence that those over age 10 may spread the virus just as easily as adults do.
 Add missing school and other factors unique to children, and it’s unethical “to allow children to take on great burdens during this pandemic but not have the opportunity to benefit from a vaccine,” Dr. Sara Goza, president of the pediatrics academy, wrote.
 Globally, pediatric studies are only hesitantly emerging. In China, Sinovac and SinoPharm have opened studies that can test children as young as 3.
 A British study of a vaccine by AstraZeneca allows for testing of a low dose in certain children but the company says it won’t be recruiting youngsters until it has “sufficient” safety data in adults.
 In the U.S., Moderna Inc., Johnson & Johnson and Novavax all hope to begin some pediatric research later in the year, in varying age groups.
 Doing so is critical, said Dr. Robert Frenck, who directs the Vaccine Research Center at Cincinnati Children’s.
 “If we immunize adolescents -- and potentially move down into younger children -- we’re going to have the effect of keeping those children from getting infected. But then also they don’t bring the infection home to parents and grandparents,” he said.
 Frenck is finding lots of interest in Pfizer’s adolescent testing, with 90 families seeking more information in just a week after his team issued a call for 16- and 17-year-old volunteers. The researchers plan to enroll 12- to 15-year-olds soon.
 Katelyn, the suburban Cincinnati volunteer, doesn’t know if she got a dummy shot or the real vaccine. But the high school junior is excited to be part of the study. And with science class still fresh, she grasped the researchers' explanation of how Pfizer’s vaccine works -- using a piece of genetic code to train the body to recognize if the coronavirus comes along.
 “I’ve learned about DNA and RNA and all that stuff in biology in freshman year. And I guess I didn’t really know, like, how it applied to the real world until now,” she said.
 It makes sense to start pediatric testing in teenagers and gradually work down in age, Frenck said, because adolescents usually receive adult-sized doses of other vaccines -- and so far with Pfizer’s shots, serious safety problems haven’t emerged in adult testing.
 Assuming Pfizer’s shot is proven to work in adults, Frenck said the key will be if the vaccine revs up adolescents' immune systems the same way -- without different side effects. He said if all goes well, it’s possible scientists may have an answer about the 12-and-older group by spring.
 But younger children need their own testing. Anderson, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta, said those studies may be more complex because smaller tots may need different doses or, because of their typically more robust immune systems, show different reactions to the shots.
 “It is quite important for us to begin the process because this will take some time to do the studies the right way,” he said.

Since the nominating conventions this summer, we have looked closely at both parties' platforms and compared them to the policy demands our members have developed. The Republican platform has not been updated since 2016 -- a startling admission that they have no plan for the pandemic, which has required an infusion of resources into health care, worker protections and an expanded safety net.
 In fact, the 2016 Republican platform called for cuts to welfare programs and wanted to put Medicaid on the chopping block.
 The 2020 Democratic platform comes closer to offering a response. The Democrats' Covid-19 plan preserves and expands health care, including Medicaid and a free public option for the poor, until the pandemic ends and the economy recovers. It would make all workers eligible for paid family and medical leave, and unemployment insurance would be expanded. And it would raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2026.
 These policies don't meet our campaign's full vision or agenda. We think health care should be expanded to all permanently through Medicaid expansion and the adoption of a universal, single payer system, and we demand a much faster implementation of wage increases, debt forgiveness and other goals.
 But the Democratic platform does show a desire to address the issues of poverty and economic insecurity that we have been raising.
 Poor people have a huge stake in this election. This is why we have committed to do M.O.R.E. — mobilize, organize, register, and educate poor and low-income voters. We're bringing people into a movement that votes and that will hold the next administration, whoever it is, accountable to the needs and demands of 140 million Americans.
 We have been building this campaign across 45 states for nearly three years, but the pandemic has given this work tremendous new urgency. The people we are organizing are concerned about one thing: Who is advancing policies that address our concerns around poverty, and who is not?
 Leading up to and on November 3, we will work to unleash the power of poor and low-income voters. And every day after, we will organize that power into a transforming force to change the heart and soul of this nation. As America listens to the final debate, nearly half of us will be waiting to hear what Trump and Biden have to say to poor and low-income people.

We are excited to partner with WWF on the project and look forward to creating lasting impact in this area." Meanwhile, Dr. Tahir Rasheed, Director Wildlife, WWF-Pakistan said that increase in fishing fleets, unsustainable fishing practices, release of untreated wastewater in sea and overexploitation of fisheries resources are posing serious threat to marine ecosystem in Pakistan.


  He shared that livelihood diversification and skill development initiatives can help promote income generation opportunities and reduce pressure on natural resources. He was of the view that fishers should be provided basic amenities of life including safe drinking water at their doorstep. 'WWF- Pakistan is creating environmental awareness among fisher communities and sensitising them on conservation of marine resources mainly wild species in Pakistani waters', he added.


  To promote sustainable fisheries and improve data about marine mammals (whales and dolphins), sharks, marine birds and other important species, WWF- Pakistan has already initiated a programme that helps gather information about them.


  In order to reduce mortality and entanglement of these animals in fishing gears, WWF-Pakistan introduced sub-surface gillnetting, which is now fully adopted by the fishermen. This initiative is being acclaimed globally as it has led to conservation of many marine animals mainly turtles, dolphins and whale sharks.


  Through the capacity building component of the project, large number of turtles, whales, sharks and other marines wildlife has been safely released by WWF-Pakistan trained fishers. This is not only improving marine resources but promotes healthy oceans in the long run.


  This workshop was organised as part of the project implemented by WWF- Pakistan in collaboration with Engro Foundation in the selected priority coastal areas of Karachi, Sindh.


  The project promotes improved fisheries management by reforming fisheries governance that helps combat illegal fishing and reduce pressure on marine ecosystem.

Spain has become the first European Union nation to record a million coronavirus infections, official data showed on Wednesday, as the government mulled fresh restrictions on public life to curb the spread of the disease.
 The country recorded 16,973 confirmed cases of Covid-19 over the past 24 hours, the health ministry announced, taking the total to 1,005,295 since its first case was diagnosed on January 31 on the remote island of La Gomera in the Canary Islands.
 Of this number, 34,366 people have died, with 156 more deaths were recorded in the previous 24 hours.
 Spain, which is home to around 47 million people, is only the sixth country in the world to cross this grim milestone after the United States, India, Brazil, Russia and Argentina, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.
 The new wave of contagion has been less deadly than in late March and April, when fatalities routinely exceeded 800 per day, as the median age of new infections has dropped.
 But with healthcare workers warning the spike could once again overwhelm hospitals, health minister Salvador Illa said on Tuesday the government was considering several new measures, including nighttime curfews such as those recently put in place in France and Belgium.
 "We are facing very tough weeks ahead, winter is coming, the second wave is no longer a threat, it is a reality across Europe," he told a news conference, adding the government was "open to everything" to contain the virus.

By Orji Sampson and Okey Alozie   This is not the best of times for one of the Permanent Secretaries in Imo State government; following allegation of diversion of N5.5M budgeted for purchase of office equipment and accessories for the various departments of one of the ministries.   It was gathered that the alleged misappropriation took place prior to the appointment of the commissioner in charge of the ministry, when the Permanent Secretary was administering the ministry.   Sources revealed that the suspected Perm Sec requested and obtained the said amount which was part of the N7M allegedly set aside for the purchase of the office equipment.   Though it was N7M that was earmarked for the purchase, inside sources told our correspondent that an initial N5.5M was allegedly released to the Perm Sec with the agreement that the balance of N1.5M will be released after the supply of the computers, photocopiers and other accessories.   According to some concerned members of staff who spoke on condition of strict anonymity for fear of victimization, almost one year after collecting the money, no department in the ministry has taken delivery of new office equipment.   They further stressed that some of the departmental heads in the ministry have met the permanent secretary on several occasions to find out the current status of the deal but it was learnt that on each occasion, the suspect will give excuses.   At the moment, the issue we gathered is almost causing a row in the ministry, even as the concerned Perm Sec is said to be allegedly using the issue to intimidate and harass those perceived as championing the campaign for accountability.   Sources in the ministry further told this newspaper that some of the management staff in the ministry have formally complained to the commissioner in charge, with a view for intervention.   It was also learnt that they are planning to write Gov Hope Uzodinma through the commissioner to bring the development to his knowledge and also demand for investigation.   When reached for comments, the permanent secretary promised to get back to our reporter later, but never did so as at the time of filing the report.   Meanwhile in a related development, high level of Corruption and Transfer crisis is said to be rocking Local Government Civil Service Commission in Imo State.   Our Reporter gathered that a Permanent Secretary of Local Government Civil Service Commission, name withheld is now under fire for allegedly involving in the posting and transfer scam ravaging the establishment.   The official was said to have engaged in abrasive witch-hunt of some of the Administrative and Technical Staff of the L.G.A through unwarranted posting and transfer that is causing uproar in the system.   Many of the Senior Officers according to our source were packed in some designated LGAs. For example, in Ohaji Egbema L.G.A more than four officers of the same grade level are fighting for the position of H.O.D Works as a result of the scandal involved in transfer.   The same Permanent Secretary was alleged to have allowed some level eight (8) officers to remain as Head of Department for years where as others were not allowed. The suspected official was accused to have refused to allow professionals to replace those level eight (8) officers. This issue of using unqualified staff to Head a department is causing serious crisis in all the local Government Areas now. It was also alleged that the suspect is planning to over stay in the Civil Service to continue perpetuating irregularities in the local government system.

Special Chief Secretary, Tourism and Culture, Rajat Bhargav, on Wednesday said the new tourism policy, to be released soon, is not only flexible and aggressive but will also address key issues such as giving industry status to mega tourism projects.


  ## Potential locations


  Speaking at an online interactive session on ‘Revival of tourism in Andhra Pradesh’ organised by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), Mr. Bhargav said the department had identified high potential locations for development of hotels and resorts, and had been actively marketing it to investors and developers of international repute. Plans were also in the offing to develop amusement parks and adventure sports while ensuring seamless connectivity of the destinations from all major airports.


  He emphasised the importance of marketing in quick revival of tourism.


  Responding to the issues raised by the industry bodies, Managing Director of AP Tourism Development Corporation and CEO of AP Tourism Authority Pravin Kumar said the department had adopted a strategy for revival of the sector. He said the next two months would be crucial from the standpoint of building confidence in the tourists about safe travel. Aggressive, yet cautious marketing, coupled with adherence to the SOPs for safe operation of hotels, would be critical for revival, he said.


  Mr. Pravin Kumar said the APTDC had already started operating its 37 hotels across the State.


  The tourism committee members stressed the importance of resolving the issues impeding the recovery of the sector. They said, though hotels and other establishments had opened, the footfalls were anything but encouraging.


  They said the path to revival would involve building a perception of safe tourism in the minds of people, and the neighbouring States would have to work together to ensure free flow of tourists across borders.


  “It will involve a coordinated effort between the stakeholders such as the Central government, State governments, tourism bodies, tour and travel operators and hospitality industry,” he emphasised.


  They also recommended a unified mobile app to better synergise the efforts being undertaken by various states.

Denmark was on Wednesday searching for answers after its most famous convict, submarine killer Peter Madsen, almost succeeded in escaping from a high- security prison.
 Was it because he had an accomplice, as police suspect, or was it a fiasco in one of the world's most open penitentiary systems?
 "This is a major failure," John Hatting, head of the Danish Prison and Probation Service workers' union, told AFP.
 "That he was able... to hide a fake gun but also something as crazy as a fake bomb belt, that is absolutely unacceptable. It should not happen," he said.
 Madsen, 49, is serving a life sentence for the 2017 murder of Swedish journalist Kim Wall on board his homemade submarine as she interviewed him for a profile she was writing.
 The gruesome killing made headlines around the world, gripping followers as it emerged that Madsen had chopped up her body into parts and thrown them into the Baltic Sea.
 On Tuesday morning, Madsen managed to escape briefly from the Herstedvester Prison in Copenhagen after using his fake props to threaten prison staff and break his way out.
 He stopped a passing van and forced the man behind the wheel to drive a few hundred metres (yards) before police cornered them.
 After bomb experts determined that he was not in fact carrying explosives, police hauled him away.
 Madsen appeared before a judge for a custody hearing on Wednesday where police told the judge they believed Madsen may have had accomplices, possibly providing him with the fake weapons or the material to make them.
 "Someone may have helped (Madsen) with his escape, and that's what the next 14 days should allow us to shed light on," prosecutor Rasmus Kim Petersen told reporters after Madsen was ordered held in custody for two weeks.
 \- Humane conditions -
 Denmark, like its Nordic neighbours, prides itself on the humane conditions of its prisons.
 But it also has one of Europe's highest rates of prison escapes, according to a 2018 Council of Europe report.
 This is attributed to the fact that many inmates serve their sentences in so- called 'open' prisons, where they can be granted furlough for weekends, so they can for example return to their families, explained Linda Kjaer Minke, a sociologist and criminologist at Danish University of Southern Denmark.
 In Madsen's case, "one could argue that this is a very special person with a special personality, and that guards in general should be more attentive to his creative project in general."
 Held in a high-security 'closed' prison, Madsen enjoyed -- despite the grisly nature of his crime -- the same conditions as other inmates at the facility.
 They include physical treatments, exercise, education, a library, workshop and a grocery shop where inmates can buy food and prepare their own meals, in groups or alone.
 "His conditions are no better or worse than anybody else's in prison. The primary difference is that his contact with the outside world is very limited, out of respect for the victim's family and for society in general."
 Madsen's lawyer Anders Larsen said the limited contact was the reason he tried to break out.
 "He thinks that his conditions regarding visits and communications have been toughened mostly because of who he is... and that's what motivated him" to escape, he told reporters.
 Madsen pleaded guilty Wednesday to the six preliminary charges against him, with the exception of that concerning possible accomplices, his lawyer said.
 "Even though we rank high (on escapes), the numbers are relatively low in general. Yesterday morning I would have rejected that this was likely to happen. Now there is no doubt that we need to look at our procedures," Hatting said.
 Under Danish law, an inmate serving a life sentence can ask to be paroled after 12 years.
 Madsen's escape bid will likely ruin any chances of his being granted parole, experts added.

Bell knew that no matter how involved he would be in the Chiefs offense, he would have a chance to win a championship.
 "I mean, obviously when I decided to come here I knew the weapons. There's only one football to go around," said Bell, who will share the bulk of the running load with Clyde Edwards-Helaire. "The times when I do get my opportunities, I think there is going to be a chance to show what I can do."
 Bell's patient running style is a good fit for a rejuvenated offensive line, and his ability to catch passes out of the backfield is an important element of coach Andy Reid's system. And while Bell knows the first read will often be to wide receiver Tyreek Hill, tight end Travis Kelce or another pass-catcher, there will still be chances to get his hands on the ball in the passing game.
 "He's a mismatch coming out of the backfield, the way he's able to run routes, split out and be another receiver out there. It's special," Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes said. "He's going to have a lot of matchups with linebackers on him and I'm sure he's pretty excited about that."
 Exactly how involved Bell will be in the short term will depend on his ability to quickly pick up the playbook.
 Reid long has had a reputation for a robust menu of plays, and learning them all with a full offseason and training camp is difficult enough. But Bell will have to do it on the fly, picking up just enough to make him available on Sunday, then adding to his knowledge each week through the remainder of the season.
 "I think we'll take it day by day and just see how he does and what he's comfortable with," Reid said. "One thing you try not to forget is how much volume you have at this point in the year. Really you just have to have good communication between us, the coaches, and the player, and see exactly where he's at. He'll get in there and practice and we'll see where it goes."
 NOTES: DT Taco Charlton (knee), DE Alex Okafor (hamstring), RT Mitch Schwartz (back) and WR Sammy Watkins (hamstring) did not work out on a gloomy Wednesday that forced practice indoors. ... The six-week window for OL Martinas Rankin (knee) to practice and be activated off the PUP list began this week. "He hasn't really done anything so we'll just wee how it works out," Reid said. "We'll kind of take that day by day, too."

Collectors have long treasured these early large cents. In fact, large cents struck from 1793 through 1814 have been among the most popular numismatic collectibles for hobbyists in the United States since coin collecting really began growing in popularity throughout the nation during the mid 19th century. The 1793 Wreath reverse cents, which were only the second subtype of large cent produced following the 1793 Chain cents from earlier that year, are rare across the board. Even well-worn examples are worth thousands of dollars.

"I was just like, 'This is unbelievable,'" said Bell, who had to return a week's worth of negative COVID-19 tests before joining his new team. He took the practice field for the first time Wednesday ahead of Sunday's game in Denver.
 "I was watching kind of like, 'As a defense, they're so tough to stop,'" Bell continued. "There's so many weapons. You have to pick your poison. You have the guys coaching, the offensive line, the quarterback - they're all making the right decision and all on the same page. It's a tough offense to stop. I'm just going to come in and fit in where I can."
 That might not have been the attitude the 28-year-old Bell had earlier in his career.
 After making a trio of Pro Bowl trips and becoming a star with the Steelers, he earned a me-first reputation when he sat out an entire season in a contract dispute. And it didn't go away when he took to social media and liked a series of tweets from fans and pundits that questioned his usage - or lack thereof - in Jets coach Adam Gase's offensive system.
 When the Jets eventually released him, Bell said he quickly narrowed his options to three teams. But one stood out above the rest, and not just because his offseason training partner, Chiefs defensive tackle Chris Jones, was constantly in his ear.
