The storylines of Jessica, Tyler, Zack Dempsey and Tony Padilla too fail to strike a chord. Agreed, this is a teen drama made for younger audiences. But it is still disappointing to watch a series that suggests it aims to 'raise conversations around issues' not advocate any real solutions. It is mostly fixated on the problems without giving a full account of those either.

This latest season gave me a renewed appreciation for Riverdale, another teen drama steaming on Netflix, often compared to 13 Reasons Why by fans. An unabashed teen soap, Riverdale sticks to its intentions. 13 Reasons Why, despite its tall claims, is all over the place and falls shorts of even being a teen soap.

A former editor at the Los Angeles Times and Orange Coast magazine, Anne started out as an entertainment reporter at The Orange County Register and recently returned to writing. She has come full circle, covering food and other lifestyle topics, and is back where she belongs.

But new ad metric models are resodding the long-standing TV advertising playing field, with networks and advertisers at loggerheads about how—and how much—to get paid. David Verklin, CEO of Carat Americas, the world's largest independent media buying agency, is an interested observer of the action. In his new book Watch This, Listen Up, Click…

The stock of station operator LIN TV surged 25% Friday on heavy volume, despite an overall soggy tone in the equity markets, as investors went fishing for a bargain. The move was a change of pace for LIN, which was battered in recent weeks as leveraged-buyout premiums are erased from the market. The stock price was already on the decline when it took a particularly hard fall last Friday, sliding 8% after fellow independent operator Nexstar Broadcasting officially took itself off the market due…

Athletic catcher with solid defensive skills was on his way to a terrific junior season with a team-leading six home runs and 20 RBIs while batting .296. Switch-hitter was the ACC freshman of the year and followed that up last year by hitting .288 with 10 HRs and 40 RBIs and committing just five errors in 476 chances. Also threw out 33% of would-be basestealers. Likely the first catcher drafted this year.

Biden’s campaign manager, Jen O’Malley Dillon, mentions Georgia along with Arizona and Texas as the next three states that Democrats can flip. Still, O’Malley Dillon holds up Arizona as the best opportunity for Democrats, implicitly tamping down expectations in Georgia.
 The biggest question is whether Biden can generate enough excitement among the state’s large black community to have a legitimate chance to flip the state this fall.
 NAACP President Derrick Johnson downplayed the significance of Biden’s early advantage among black voters.
 “You can put a truck driver on the ballot against the current president, and you’re going to get a similar result in terms of support. What’s really at issue here is enthusiasm,” Johnson said in an interview. “Are individuals across the country energized enough behind his vision to turn out to vote? That’s the question that’s on the table.”
