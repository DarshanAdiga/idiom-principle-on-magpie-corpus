I was about to leap to disagree with you 'Just Saying' with regard to the shape dating quickly.....but actually this grey one in the gallery does look dated. It may be the colour, but I would say that there is a white and a Red metallicQF in our area, and I have to say that in the flesh, they do look fresher than these pictured here.
