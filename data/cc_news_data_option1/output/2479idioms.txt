Former national security adviser John Bolton should drop a thank you note in the mail to President Donald Trump and maybe throw in a sleeve of golf balls.
   
 Authors and publishing houses beg and plead for a book review in a big city paper. The best-known authors travel the country visiting book stores, giving lectures and autographing their books to drum up sales.
   
 Thanks to President Trump, and his personal legal team over at the Department of Justice, John Bolton's name and photograph are on the front page of every newspaper in the country, and around the world. More importantly, right next to Bolton's name is the title of his soon to be released book, "The Room Where it Happened."
   
 It all began when Bolton joined the Trump administration. He signed a nondisclosure agreement with the government agreeing to submit any manuscript about his tenure to the White House for prepublication review so the government could ensure that it did not contain classified information.
   
 The Justice Department has acknowledged that Bolton submitted his manuscript for review in the last days of 2019. After a lengthy review the prepublication process was completed and, according to the Washington Post, the "manuscript draft did not contain classified information."
   
 Get the printing presses rolling -- Bolton's book is ready for release. Well, not so fast, the White House's senior director for intelligence, Michael Ellis was "concerned that the manuscript still appeared to contain classified information, in part because the same administration that the author served is still in office and that the manuscript described sensitive information about ongoing foreign policy issues."
   
 The White House was so concerned about the possible breach of national security that the Justice Department filed a lawsuit to stop the release of Bolton's book. The next day, they filed for a restraining order to enjoin Bolton and his publisher Simon & Schuster from releasing the book.
   
 There is one obstacle in the way of the DOJ's effort to muzzle Bolton. The United States Constitution, namely the First Amendment.
   
 The Justice Department's efforts to stop "The Room Where it Happened" from being released is known as a prior restraint. Under well-established First Amendment law there is an almost absolute prohibition against the imposition of prior restraints against the publication of books and news stories related to public officials.
   
 The First Amendment has always stood for the principle that people have a right to publish information free from government censorship.
   
 Relating to national security, there are some narrow exceptions to a prior restraint. The remedy is prepublication review. Bolton got consent to publish and then White House officials jumped in. As the Washington Post suggested, the White House's concern is, "(J)ust another way of saying the book includes recent, newsworthy information of public concern that the president wants to conceal."
   
 According to the New York Times, Bolton's lawyer Charles J. Cooper called the DOJ's lawsuits "a transparent attempt to use national security as a pretext to censor Mr. Bolton, in violation of his constitutional right to speak on matters of the utmost public import."
   
 The relationship between prior restraint and national security was famously tested in 1971. In what became known as the "Pentagon Papers" the Nixon Administration attempted to prevent the New York Times and Washington Post from publishing materials belonging to a classified Defense Department study regarding the history of United States activities in Vietnam. Lawyers for President Richard Nixon argued that prior restraint was necessary to protect national security.
   
 The Supreme Court disagreed. The Court ruled that the government's use of the vague word "security" should not be the premise "to abrogate the fundamental law embodied in the First Amendment." The High Court reasoned since the publication of the Pentagon Papers "would not cause an inevitable, direct, and immediate event imperiling the safety of American forces, prior restraint was unjustified."
   
 Setting the bluster aside, the DOJ has little chance of blocking the release of Bolton's book or quelling the administration's embarrassment that follows.

  Ole Gunnar Solskjaer saluted Anthony Martial's improved killer instinct after his hat-trick fired Manchester United to a 3-0 win over Sheffield United on Wednesday.


  Martial struck twice in the first half and completed his first senior treble after the interval at Old Trafford.


  The France forward is the first United player to score a Premier League hat- trick since Alex Ferguson retired as their manager in 2013.


  His heroics stole the spotlight from United team-mate Paul Pogba, who was making his first start since September 30.


  Solskjaer's side, unbeaten in their last 13 games in all competitions, remain in fifth place, but they are now just two points behind fourth-placed Chelsea, who face Manchester City on Thursday.


  United's first win since the coronavirus hiatus was well deserved and Solskjaer suggested Martial's role in it was down to hard work on the training ground.


  "Very happy for Anthony. The third goal was a great goal, but for me the first and the second were better," he said.


  "He's in the box, ready to go. We have worked on that, getting in the box in that situation more often.


  "At the near post he showed composure. The first goal was vital, the way he turns and gets himself into a position to score from the cross.


  "I'm very pleased with that. He's in good form."


  Martial's clinical finishing ensured United built on Friday's draw at Tottenham, but Pogba's confident return in his 10th appearance of an injury- ravaged campaign was also encouraging for Solskjaer.


  Pogba came off the bench to deliver an influential cameo against Tottenham, winning the penalty that Bruno Fernandes converted.


  Once again, he linked up well with Fernandes, the Portugal midfielder who has been a big hit since his January move from Sporting Lisbon, but there will be much sterner tests than the one posed by Chris Wilder's limp side.


  "I thought we controlled the game. Paul and Bruno showed some quality and it's exciting for us to be working with talent like this," Solskjaer said.


  "At times it was very good football. We could and should have scored more goals."


  The Blades have failed to score in their first three games since the restart and their hopes of a fairytale run to Champions League qualification are fading.


  "We have got to find an answer from somewhere. We looked pretty tired," Wilder said.


  On the hottest day of the year in Britain, United were playing behind closed doors at Old Trafford for the first time.


  The club had put enormous mosaics featuring photos of fans across three stands to cover the seats and the empty stadium was echoing to the shouts of celebrating United players after just seven minutes.


  Marcus Rashford pounced on a loose ball in the penalty area and, with the visitors' defence slow to react, he whipped a low cross to Martial, who fired home at the near post.


  It was Martial's 12th league goal of the season -- the most he has managed in a single top-flight campaign in his career.


  The influential Fernandes started the move that brought United's second goal in the 44th minute.


  Freezing the Blades' defence with his fake shot, Fernandes found Pogba, who spread the ball wide to Aaron Wan-Bissaka.


  When Wan-Bissaka crossed low into the six-yard box, Martial, easily evading more sloppy marking, was on hand to beat stand-in goalkeeper Simon Moore with ruthless efficiency.


  United saved the best until last as a superb flowing move ended with Martial passing to Rashford and running onto the return pass before dinking a delicate chip over Moore in the 74th minute.


  The only thing Martial did wrong all day was forget the match ball that goes to hat-trick scorers, but he remembered just in time to claim it from the officials as he walked off the pitch.

  Liverpool will be crowned champions of England for the first time in 30 years on Thursday should Manchester City fail to beat Chelsea at Stamford Bridge.


  Jurgen Klopp's men moved to the brink of a long-awaited Premier League title in the style that has made them worthy champions-elect by thrashing Crystal Palace 4-0 on their return to Anfield behind closed doors on Wednesday.


  Trent Alexander-Arnold, Mohamed Salah, Fabinho and Sadio Mane scored the goals as the Reds opened up a 23-point lead at the top of the table.


  Should City keep the title race alive at Chelsea, a point will be good enough for Liverpool to win the league when the top two meet in Manchester on July 2.


  "Tonight was a big step, that's clear," said Klopp. "We've all still got to play seven games. If we play like this it's really not nice to play against us."


  City boss Pep Guardiola said on Wednesday his priority is Sunday's FA Cup quarter-final rather than prolonging Liverpool's wait and he could rest players for a trip to Newcastle at the weekend.


  "Pep should play poker," added Klopp. "They are brilliant, the football they play is unbelievable.


  "We are different and we have to be. There are different ways of playing football and I like them both."


  Alexander-Arnold opened the floodgates for Liverpool on Wednesday when the right-back curled a sumptuous free-kick beyond the grasp of Wayne Hennessey to settle any nerves on 23 minutes.


  The England international admitted many of his teammates will be tuning into events in West London, but wants this Liverpool side to go on and rewrite the record books no matter when they clinch the title.


  City set the Premier League points record of 100 two seasons ago, but Klopp's side could still reach 107 with seven games remaining.


  "A lot of us will watch it tomorrow but not get too excited," said Alexander- Arnold.


  "We've still got to prepare for the game next week regardless. We've still got seven games left I think and we're going to try and get all 21 points from those games."


  Before kick-off "You'll Never Walk Alone" boomed around a deserted Anfield, but without the usual accompanying chorus of nearly 55,000 fans.


  Instead, banners and flags were draped over The Kop on the night Liverpool could have clinched the title had they won the Merseyside derby on Sunday.


  "Imagine if this stadium would have been full today and all the people could have experienced it live," said Klopp. "I don't think the game could have been better because my boys played like everybody was in the stadium."


  From the start, Liverpool looked far sharper than in that goalless draw at Everton in their first match for three months.


  "There was a lot more rhythm and fluency than Sunday," said Alexander-Arnold. "Today we've come out, started fast and didn't really put a foot wrong in the whole game. It will go down as one of our best performances of the season."


  Salah showed a clinical touch to net his 21st goal of the season from Fabinho's ball over the top to make it 2-0 just before half-time.


  Liverpool's long wait for a title has been extended by three months due to the unprecedented coronavirus shutdown.


  That wait could take just one more day, another week or slightly longer should City show their pride to win the battle of the top two next week.


  However, there remains no doubt the title drought is coming to an end and Wednesday's dominant display underlined why they will be champions.


  Fabinho's piledriver set the seal on a 23rd straight league win at Anfield as the Brazilian drilled home from fully 30 yards.


  The front three of Salah, Roberto Firmino and Mane have been key to Liverpool's rise over the past three years from struggling just to qualify for the Champions League to winning that competition last season and now running away with the English top-flight.


  All three combined beautifully for the fourth 20 minutes from time as Firmino fed Salah, whose pass picked out the run of Mane and the Senegalese slotted into the far corner.
