The undisputed leader in the smaller categories, MotoGP was the next stop and, in 2012, with the entry of the new CRT category, the Valencian team won again thanks to Aleix Espargaró and Randy De Puniet, with two CERT titles for the team between 2012 and 2013. Meanwhile, the team never gave up on the young riders, and in 2018, with the tribute to the late Angel Nieto and the renaming of the team as the 12+1 times world champion, the team achieved a new World Championship title, this time in the Junior Moto3 World Championship with Raul Fernandez. The work with the young riders and with Nico Terol continued to bear fruit in 2020 with the title of Junior Moto3 World Champion for Izan Guevara, who completed an extraordinary double with David Alonso as the winner of the European Talent Cup.

“Looking back, of course there are some things that we could have done to improve and get results sooner, but I usually start slower in most categories, but I never give up and we get there. We have achieved two podiums this year which was a dream before the season started. One was in special conditions but the podium in Aragon was the icing on the cake. Unfortunately, we couldn’t deliver the Rookie of the Year title because of our ambition in Aragon and Valencia but we remain very satisfied with what we have done in the second half of the year. Thanks to everyone who made this year possible from Dorna to our sponsors and the fans at home and around the world. Of course, I would have loved to have had the fans at the track, but it was not possible, and I hope we were able to put on a good show for them this year. It has been a very difficult year for everyone in the world away from the circuit.”

UNT should be thrilled to be in that spot and even more excited about how this week sets up as they head to San Antonio to face UTSA (6-4, 4-2).
 UNT spent more than a decade as the only Texas team in the Sun Belt Conference complaining that it didn’t have any in-state rivalries or series that its fans cared about.
 Playing consequential games against teams with regional interest is how rivalries form. This week’s game against UTSA is going to be the next in what is quickly becoming a long line of those games between the Mean Green and Roadrunners.
 UNT isn’t the only team that has suddenly gotten hot in C-USA. UTSA is on a roll as well and has won consecutive games.
 The Roadrunners head into the week sitting at the top of what looks like a pile of mediocrity in C-USA’s West Division. UTSA is the only team in the league more than a game over .500, either on the season or in conference play. The Roadrunners knocked off Southern Miss 23-20 on Saturday to move to the top of the West, where UAB also has a .667 winning percentage in league play at 2-1.
 The Mean Green know they need to mount a late-season run to stay in the race for a spot in the C-USA title game and took another step in the right direction with their win over the Owls.
 “I was proud of the way our guys competed,” UNT coach Seth Littrell said afterward. “It wasn’t always clean. I told them after the game you are going to have to win football games like that. You are not always going to go out and be perfect in all three phases.”
 UNT should be perfectly willing to win ugly if it sets up games like this week’s showdown with UTSA.
 Make no mistake about it, UNT’s recent players consider this a key rivalry because of what has transpired in a short series the Mean Green lead 4-3. UNT was in position to play in the C-USA title game back in 2013 before UTSA upset the Mean Green at Apogee Stadium.
 The players from that team will tell you that loss still stings.
 UNT’s only win in a 1-11 season in 2015 was a 30-23 victory over the Roadrunners.
 The fact UNT and UTSA are league rivals at all doesn’t sit well with a lot of the Mean Green faithful. UNT has been playing for more than 100 years. The school fought and scraped to earn a spot in C-USA. UTSA landed in the conference after playing its first game in 2011 because of the C-USA’s strategy to add schools in big television markets.
 There are plenty of core UNT supporters who feel like the school’s athletics program should be a few steps up from UTSA in the college football pecking order considering the head start it had.
 The only recourse for UNT comes on the field and on the recruiting trail. The Mean Green lost a battle there when UTSA swiped Tyler Lee defensive end Jamal Ligon a year ago.
 Ligon was committed to UNT for months before backing out when UTSA hired Jeff Traylor. The Roadrunners coach hired his brother, Kurt Traylor, to join his staff.
 It just so happens Kurt Traylor was Ligon’s head coach at Tyler Lee. Ligon followed Kurt Traylor to UTSA and is one of the best freshmen in C-USA.
 That connection is just another spicy angle when it comes to UNT’s game against UTSA this week.
 The good news for the Mean Green is those connections are not all there is to talk about as the teams prepare to face off on Saturday.
 Consequential games are what rivalries are all about. UNT and UTSA are about to play another one this week.
 That might be the best news of all for UNT considering where the Mean Green stood just a few weeks ago.

Okay, I'll admit it — after a year like 2020, this hyperbole probably does not hit home the way it usually would around this time. Let's not pretend a few family squabbles could phase us at this point.
 However, as we officially enter the holiday season next week, I can’t help but think about how much unnecessary stress and tension is provoked by our incapacity for substantive conversation.
 The archetypal scene of the holiday squabble, embedded in the American psyche, is the subject of Saturday Night Live skits and sitcom episodes. It’s almost a cliché; impossible to talk about without conjuring up a somewhat comical caricature.
 I have read countless op-eds and cultural diagnoses which depict this phenomenon of familial fissures as simply a microcosm of the country’s larger political divisions.
 This might very well be true, but why is no one talking about how concerning it is that our most fundamental relationships are becoming politicized in such a pervasive and destructive way?

Joe Burrow was looking forward to 2021 even as his rookie season was apparently ended by a scary knee injury.
 "Thanks for all the love. Can't get rid of me that easy. See ya next year," the Cincinnati Bengals franchise quarterback tweeted after he was carted off the field early in the third quarter of a 20-9 loss at Washington on Sunday.
 Burrow was hit high and low by Washington linemen Montez Sweat and Jonathan Allen after throwing a pass, and the QB's left leg bent the wrong way. Burrow couldn't put any weight on it as he was helped onto a cart.
 "That's an injury right there to a team leader that can take the wind out of your sails," Bengals coach Zac Taylor said. "It's not fun. He was making improvements every week, and we were getting the offense headed in a direction that we thought was exciting."
 Burrow was 22 of 34 for 203 yards and a touchdown before the injury.

“This week, every time I clock into work, I feel unsafe in my surroundings — more than I did before,” she said. “It’s not enough that we were emailed a second sexual assault training — as if it’s on us, as if it’s our responsibility, as if it’s my behavior that needs to change.”
 She said she feels burdened with the responsibility to ward off attackers by changing her own behavior, citing the fact that her boss encourages her to deny athletes’ offers to walk her to her car after work and tells her to carry her taser in hand instead.
 “It’s not on me,” she said. “It’s not on you. It’s not on any women on this campus. It’s on them. It’s always been on them. It’s not your fault. These boys are catered to every single day.”
 Student Body President Stone Cox was in attendance Friday along with other members of SG’s executive branch including VP Hannah Barrios, Deputy Chief of Staff Angelina Cantelli and Senior Adviser Gabie deBruler. Cox’s administration faced backlash on social media after vetoing legislation that would have increased sexual assault training on campus Nov 6.
 Cox said his administration has been moved to action in light of the USA Today investigation. He said the newly-elected SG Senate Speaker Marina Cole is working to form a committee dedicated to supporting survivors through communicating with administration.
 “As students, we have to make sure that we hold them accountable and present them with ideas as well,” Cox said. “We also need to hold our friends and classmates accountable.”
 Senators introduced two new pieces of legislation on Nov. 18 that would increase sexual assault training after Cox vetoed the original bill. Cox said he has no plans to veto the new bills, and he plans to sign both bills as soon as they make it onto his desk.
 “The veto had nothing to do with the fact that the bill was about sexual assault,” Cox said. “It had to do with the fact that the legislation had issues. It was not enforceable. The new pieces of legislation are perfectly and wonderfully written.”
 As SG president, Cox has a seat on the LSU Board of Supervisors. He said he will have no problems demanding the resignation of any University officials found guilty of negligence through an independent investigation the University has requested.
 “If any administrators mishandled a situation, misrepresented the truth or didn’t do their jobs, I absolutely will call for their resignation,” Cox said. “If we have systems in place to protect survivors of sexual assault, and people are actively going around those systems to protect athletes and win games, that is disgusting. They need to resign or be fired.”
 Johnson, who recently resigned from her position as SG director of diversity, said she felt like her advocacy efforts and the efforts of other concerned student leaders fell on deaf ears early in the semester.
 “Before this article came out, BWEI spoke with administration about rape culture on campus, and we gave them several ideas to shift the culture on campus. They didn’t take any of our advice, so now we’re here,” Johnson said. “The rape culture that has been persistent and allowed to thrive on campus has caused our anger to boil over.”
 Former SG senator and coastal environmental science and political science senior Jack Green said the air at the protest was one of community and of unwavering support for survivors of abuse.
 “This is the community that survivors have needed this entire time,” Green said. “After a week of people being indoors just tweeting about this issue, I think this opportunity to speak out is a catharsis we have been needing.”
 Local organizations including the Lighthouse Program and the Louisiana Foundation Against Sexual Assault were stationed at tables in front of the PMAC handing out resources for survivors and advocates. Reporters from USA Today, local news stations and publications were in attendance speaking to students and advocates.

To be level on points for 4th in the championship and ahead of many other factory bikes and seeing a KTM take three wins this season is amazing for the company and the project. I’m proud to have brought five podiums and two pole positions. I’m really proud in fact of what we have done together. In a way it is sad to say ‘bye bye’ but I feel to give KTM their best championship finish yet is the best way to go.”

"Before I go for this week, and for the season really, I can't finish up without a word about my old mate 'Crutch' (Cal Crutchlow) after his last race with us here. We'll always be mates and it's not like I won’t be hanging out with him or whatever, but it's right that we say thanks from everyone in MotoGP for everything he's done on and off the track. He's been great for the sport in his 10 years here and with everything he's achieved personally. It's not like he's going away, he'll still be around as a test rider for Yamaha next year and they're lucky to have him. You would have seen on the TV that me and the old boy had a moment as we came out of the pit lane for the last runs in Q2, it just so happened that we were coming out at the same time, so that was a cool memory to have. 'Crutch' is one of the hardest-working guys I've ever seen and always was, all through the injuries and setbacks and whatnot. He just never gives up and just comes back and goes harder. Seeing how hard he works, that has definitely rubbed off on me and made me a better MotoGP rider and a professional. Cal and Lucy, Cal's wife, they've been unreal to me ever since we were team-mates in 2015 and that's something you never forget.
