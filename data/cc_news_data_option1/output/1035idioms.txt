What can we do? Support, support, support. If it’s in your budget, show love to an artist you like. Buy an album. Hit up a merch store. Keep running up streams and helping boost artists’ signals on social media. In the long term, let’s start thinking about better ways to navigate the relationship between artist and audience. Fan-funded album projects cut overhead way down. Bandcamp gives attention to independent artists without charging them to upload music or taking an absurd cut of the revenue. (Their rates run 10-15 percent on music and merch.) Artists like Newark rapper Mach-Hommy and Long Island’s Roc Marciano have been setting higher price points on their work that more deeply take into account the costs of working and living for talent instead of just the average price the public is willing to pay, following in the footsteps of Nipsey Hussle, who bet that his following would run him $100-1000 for a mixtape and succeeded. Shell out for early access instead of waiting for the music to eventually hit streaming services, and you get to feel like a part of the process. Of course it’s not just the entertainment industry feeling the pinch from the current climate of social distancing. But those who can should do what they can, whatever way they can.

CHARLESTON -- When Clarence Woody, Lakeisha Barron Brown and Steven Robinson took the Charleston Coliseum court Wednesday night, they knew how significant that was. It hadn’t been done before in West Virginia state basketball tournament history.
 When the ball was tipped for the Class AAA girls basketball quarterfinal between Parkersburg and Spring Mills, Woody, Brown and Robinson became the first all-African-American crew to officiate a state tournament game in West Virginia. The three also officiated Thursday morning’s Gilmer County-Wheeling Central Class A quarterfinal before the tournament was suspended due to coronavirus concerns.
 One might ask what took so long for that to happen? Regardless, it was a significant landmark in West Virginia prep sports.
 Yet, if you ask any of the three, they hope that’s not at the top of the list of why they’re remembered. Of course, they’re humbled and honored to be the three to accomplish that milestone. But going on, they want to be known as three people who are good at their job.
 “The thing I don’t want people to lose perspective of is that we want to be remembered not just as the first African-American crew,” Woody said. “We want to be remembered and have people say that Clarence Woody, Lakeisha Brown and Steven Robinson are good officials. They’re professional in what they do in their communication with the coaches and the players. That’s why we do what we do.”
 To reach the level of officiating a state basketball tournament is no random happening, Secondary School Activities Commission Executive Director Bernie Dolan said. Officials have to earn their way in. Members of each regional officiating board nominate people for the opportunity. The SSAC evaluates the contenders and the top officials make the cut for the regional and state tournaments.
 The trio found out about a month before the tournament they would be working together. All of them are veterans to the job. This was Robinson’s sixth year officiating in the Kanawha Valley, Brown’s 12th and Woody’s 36th.

On ice: NHL ‘pausing’ season amid coronavirus pandemic


--DocBreak--
After Pohlonski had to break the news to his team, there was a lot of silence, but then the team began to bond together.


  “It felt like an eternity,” Pohlonski said of the silence. “We all just sat there and nobody spoke while some guys were fighting back tears. Eventually some guys stood up and started talking about how much they loved their teammates and the team.”


  The state qualifiers for Novi then decided they wanted to experience another moment in the pool together and dove in.


  “Guys just jumped into the pool because I think they had to get their emotions out,” Stefanek said. “For a lot of swimmers, getting in the pool has always been a way to stop thinking about the other things going on in life. I think we just wanted to feel that normal feeling in the pool and get away from what was going on. It made us feel a little better in the moment.”


  Pohlonski was moved by his swimmers’ decisions and wanted them to have that experience as long as they desired.


  “I just told the guys that I would stick around the pool as long as they wanted,” Pohlonski said. “It made me feel proud that they love their team and their sport so much that they decided to go into the pool after their dreams had been crushed. It allowed us to bond some more as a team, share some laughs, and leave the pool that day on a somewhat positive note.”


  The MHSAA hasn’t officially cancelled the boys swimming and diving state finals. The door is still open for the championship to be held at a later date, though it's still unclear when athletic activities will be able to resume at all.


  “If they held the meet down the road, I am sure the times wouldn’t be as great because of the training aspect that goes into swimming, but there would still be great races and I am sure the athletes would be excited for the opportunity to compete one more time,” Pohlonski said. “There would still be great races and a great environment.”


  Regardless of what occurs, Pohlonski hopes his swimmers can learn from this difficult week.


  “I think the life lesson in all this is that you have to treasure the moments you have with your team and competing, because you never know when it could be over,” Pohlonski said. “There’s no guarantees in life and you really develop a special bond when you’re part of a team that you might overlook when you’re in the midst of it, but really miss when it is gone. Being able to have those moments is something I think these boys won’t take for granted and will remember the most now.”

In order to diagnose the system, you first need to connect to the OBDII port on the vehicle and download any Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs) stored in the vehicle’s ECU. If the process is done correctly, the DTC should highlight which sensor(s) is failing and needs to be replaced. It may even indicate if a sensor battery is low. In this case, it is always best to recommend that the driver replace all four sensors during a single service, especially if they are still original sensors. When one sensor dies, the rest will likely follow shortly after. Replacing all sensors will save time and money for the driver in the long run.

KIRKLAND, Wash. (CNN) -Family members of patients are trying to show their love without being able to touch them, as nursing homes across the United States are now under temporary visitation and interaction restrictions.The CDC changed their guidelines for nursing homes and long-term care facilities Friday night after President Trump declared a national emergency over the coronavirus outbreak.The guidelines now urge facilities to restrict all visitations except for “certain compassionate care situations, such as end of life situations.”"She said she woke up crying this morning,” Bridget Parkhill said, whose mother is in the Life Care Center in Kirkland, Washington. The center has been linked to 25 coronavirus cases, according to the Associated Press.Parkhill and her sister, Carmen Gray, sat outside their mother’s window with a picnic, trying to soothe her on the phone. They say their mother came to the center for rehab from a knee replacement and ended up getting coronavirus.Parkhill says the process has been horrible and both sisters try their best not to show their mother the dread they feel.“It’s been like a nightmare that I just can’t wake up from,” Parkhill said. “I just want see Mom and talk to her face to face, and laugh with her, and joke with her, and play backgammon and all the stuff we used to do together."Families are worried their grandparents and parents aren't getting the care they need, especially after hearing the center has lost about a third of their active employees.Timothy Killian, a spokesperson for the center, reassured them that the “staff is doing all they can with the resources that they have.”CDC guidelines stated volunteers and non-essential personnel should be restricted as well, the guidelines report, and group activities, including communal dining, should be cancelled.The guidelines also recommend facilities implement active screening of residents and healthcare personnel for “fever and respiratory symptoms.”Copyright 2020 CNN.

Thanks to the coronavirus, the Graham County Chamber of Commerce will be operating a little bit differently in the days to come.
 Early this morning, the chamber announced on Facebook employees will be keeping the doors locked during normal business hours, but they'll still be able to answer questions, provide maps and brochures.
 Visitors can ask questions over the phone (928-428-2511) and staff can send maps, pamphlets and other items through their mail slot.
 "We are hoping to do our part to flatten the curve of the growth of the virus. This is especially important with so many people travelers coming in and out of the Chamber," the Facebook statement reads.
 For the time being, chamber staff are not expected to attend community events in closed spaces or where physical contact can be expected.
 According to the statement, WineFest is scheduled for April 24-26 and is still moving forward, but chamber officials will need to consider cancelling if the virus grows rapidly.
 The Arizona Department of Health Services have not updated the state's coronavirus numbers since Friday morning. At that time, the state had tested 143 people.

 According to the state, 94 tests have come back negative and another 40 tests are pending.

BRAINTREE -- The town will make a third attempt to secure state funding for an update of Braintree High School.


  The school committee voted last week to submit a statement of interest to the Massachusetts School Building Authority for work on high school, built nearly a half-century ago. The town council is scheduled to take up the request at its meeting Tuesday night.


  "Third time's a charm, we hope" said School Superintendent Frank Hackett at the meeting.


  The statement is the first step in securing state funds for a school building project. It tells authority officials about deficiencies in school facilities and how they effect the educational program. If accepted by the school building authority, the agency will work with the town to develop the project.


  One of the four tax increase questions voters will decide at the March 28 special election seeks $1.5 million for the redevelopment of the high school. The study is one of the requirements of the school building process.


  The main question on the ballot is to borrow $86.5 million through a debt exclusion to build a new South Middle School, part of a plan to expand the middle schools to accommodate Grade 5 classes and free up space in the elementary schools. The school building authority will contribute $31 million towards the new school.


  The other questions are for $5 million for school roof projects and $1 million to upgrade security at school buildings.


  If voters approve all four questions, it would add 38 cents per $1,000 to the town's residential tax rate. For an average Braintree home, valued at $502.594, this would add up to an additional $191 in annual property taxes. The tax increase would expire once the loans are paid off, the bulk of it in 30 years when the borrowing for a new South is repaid.


  As for the East Middle School, the project manager told the school committee the construction work remains on schedule.


  "We are still on track to complete on June 20," said Michael Carroll of Hill International, the town's project manager.


  School committee Chair Thomas Devin said construction at East is "on budget and on time."

On top of not being able to play games, teams also aren’t allowed to practice, condition or lift weights during the suspension. While it’s out of Jennings’ hands, he hopes his players are able to stay sharp.


  “I’m just going to send ’em home and give ’em a bucket of balls and give ’em a bat and say, ‘Hey, you need to be throwing and doing all that stuff and expect to play, hopefully in two-and-a-half weeks,” Jennings said.


  If Williamson has it his way, his coach doesn’t have anything to worry about.


  “I think me and my teammates will get together, without the coaches here, because they’re not allowed to assemble us,” Williamson said. “We’ll practice on our own, because we know we’ll have games when we get back.”


  While the plan is to resume play after two-and-a-half weeks, Jennings and Williamson recognize that if the COVID-19 coronavirus continues to spread, high school baseball season could be in danger of being canceled altogether.


  “I’m very worried. I think that’s everybody,” Jennings said. “When you see college baseball canceled and over, and you see what the NBA is doing, and the higher levels, it’s just going to trickle down. And it could happen. And if it happens, it happens, and there’s nothing anybody can do about it, but I know we would all hate it.”


  Added Williamson: “I don’t want it to be the end, and it could be. Because they’ve postponed it now, and if it gets worse, that could just mean they do it again. Let’s hope not though.”
