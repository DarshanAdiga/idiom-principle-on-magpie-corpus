“If you’re doing something on someone’s network and you have friendly forces also on the network, you don’t want to have fratricide,” said a former senior military intelligence official. Even inside the U.S. intelligence community, the CIA has a reputation for secrecy, according to former officials. The CIA’s “deconfliction is poor, they’re not keeping people in the loop on what their cyber operations are,” said another former official.

When we returned from our trip to Starbucks, we noticed that the tiny bird had hopped into our front window well. We glanced at each other nervously, fearful that the mama wouldn’t be able to get to her offspring. We also have a few feral cats in the area, and we didn’t want to see the poor thing become the next best thing to Purina Cat Chow. I ventured closer to the window well, where the baby had moved closer to a bed of dried leaves. His plumage was a perfect camouflage. The next day, we saw him fly off to meet his mom on the roof of a neighbor’s home.

 While Robinson’s contributions to Black baseball are well known, the video on predecessor Hill will likely be a first-time introduction for many in attendance. Reva historian Zann Nelson extensively researched Hill in establishing his Culpeper County connection and proper name. She said a vast number of achievements by people of color prior to the 1960s and ‘70s have been untold or covered up.
 “This eradication of history by omission distorts and denies the full story and acts as a tool for the perpetuation of myths and bias,” said former Star- Exponent columnist Nelson, president of History Quest. “Pete Hill is a role model not simply for children of color, but in a grander way for all who come from hardship and meager beginnings, but through grit, perseverance and faith rise to their best capacity.”
 Hill lived and played ball in a segregated world, she added.
 “He was well respected during his life as a ball player, but never enjoyed that equality of his abilities matched against the white players, not until after his death,” Nelson said. “The record is clear now … that he was a super power and had he been allowed could have excelled on the white field.”
 Born 1884 in the village of Buena near Rapidan, Hill, the son of former slaves, was a pre-League pioneer known for his speed and power. He finished the 1919 season in Detroit with 28 home runs, one less than Babe Ruth hit in his breakthrough final season with the Red Sox. Hill moved from rural Culpeper with his mother and two brothers at a very early age. It was in Pittsburgh, Pa. that he learned to play ball.
 The Hill video showing for the first time Tuesday night is part of a long-term local baseball history project of partners FredNats, Germanna Community College, Dovetail Cultural Resources and the Fredericksburg Area Museum. A local baseball history wall will be unveiled in August. Germanna Community College graduate Ben Onguene narrates the video, saying baseball was segregated until Robinson broke the color line in 1947.
 “One hundred years ago, Hill emerged from Culpeper County to become one of the most feared hitters in the game,” Onguene says, noting Hill had a career .362 batting average.

NEW YORK (AP) — Stocks rose across the board on Wall Street Wednesday following some encouraging, though very early results in developing a coronavirus vaccine. Rearchers said late Tuesday that one developed by the National Institutes of Health and Moderna revved up people’s immune systems in a preliminary test, as hoped. The S&P 500 rose 0.9% after being up as much as 1.3% during the morning. Small-company stocks rose much more than the rest of the market, a sign of of rising expectations for the economy. Cruise lines, hotels and other companies that would benefit greatly from the economy reopening rose sharply.
