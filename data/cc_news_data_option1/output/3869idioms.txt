The economic offences wing (EOW) of the Mumbai Police arrested two of the six co-owners of an investment firm for allegedly duping 241 people to the tune of ₹76 crore by accepting money from them by offering 12% annual interest. The accused used the money to invest in other firms for higher returns, but as they failed to pay the interest as well as return the principal amount, the investors lodged complaints against them.


  Hasmukh Gogari and Pankaj Chheda, co-partners of Ramnik Hashmukh Associate have been arrested, confirmed Parag Manere, deputy commissioner of police, EOW.


  Both the accused have been charged under sections 409 (breach of trust), 420 (cheating), 120B (conspiracy) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code and sections 3 and 4 of the Maharashtra Protection of Interest of Depositors (MPID) Act. Other accused partner in the firm and their relatives who were named in the case are Ramnik Dedhia, Dilesh Vira, Mukesh Chheda, Kushal Chheda and their relatives Hemant Chheda and Jayesh Dedhia. They are yet to be arrested.


  "Arrested accused Gogari and Chheda are one of the main accused in the fraud in which 241 investors have been duped of ₹76 crore. They were produced before the court and have been remanded in police custody till October 1," said Rajendra Sangale, senior inspector, MPID unit.


   


   


  According to EOW, the arrests have been made based on the complaint of Rajesh Shah, a Goregaon resident, who alleged that Ramnik Hashmukh Associate lured him into investing money by offering 1 to 1.05% interest per month in 2016.


  "The firm had given a promissory note to investors as an acknowledgement. The said note was allegedly also signed by concerned executives of the firm where the investor's money would be further invested for high returns," said a police officer.


  Shah, who works at a senior post in a private bank, was also promised by the accused firm that they would return the money within a month if the investor wished to withdraw the amount.


  Shah invested ₹48 lakh and initially received the interest regularly. However, since January 1, 2018, he had not received interest nor the principal amount, following which he filed a complaint, a copy of which is with HT.


  Later, Shah learnt that many others had also not got their money from the firm, and all of them all visited the firm's office in Matunga. The firm told them that they were facing a major crisis due to demonetisation.


  However, investors later found out that the firm invested their money in eight other companies under their relative's names.


  Shah and 77 other investors then approached EOW. The case was first registered at Matunga police station, later EOW took over the investigation. During investigation more victim investors turned up before the police and now there are 241 victim investors. The number of investors and fraud amount are likely to go up in coming days as the two accused have been arrested, said Sangale.

Swansea are yet to concede a goal in three league games played so far this season.
 “I have said before that to keep a clean sheet in the Championship is no mean feat, so to be able to keep three in a row is excellent,” Cooper said after the game, as reported by his club’s official website.
 “The challenge now is to try and keep that going in the next game. I knew the stat about three in a row as Joe Rodon had mentioned it to me, and it’s good to have done that. But we don’t want to look back, we have to look forward.
 “But we are defending well as a team, and don’t underestimate how important the work and running Jamal, Andre [Ayew] and Morgan [Gibbs-White] do up the top of the pitch, putting pressure on defenders and forcing them to go long.
 “It helps out the backline, the midfield are competing well and the boys at the back are defending for their lives. We played well on and off the ball today.”
 Currently second on the league table, Swansea have set their sights on finishing the season with a Premier League promotion ticket after narrowly missing out last term.
 “First and foremost it’s a good result, any win away from home in the Championship is and that is reflected in the mood in the dressing room,” said Cooper.

Last Sunday’s dedication of the Gold Star Family Monument on the county’s courthouse grounds stood in stark contrast to the national conflict over the removal of monuments from public spaces and proved that the public still supports and benefits from memorials dedicated to those who sacrifice for our country and its principles. It was also a testament to the hard work of Maria Myers and Trish Slape, both Gold Star Mothers, that despite tremendous odds they could and did accomplish a goal that will stand the test of time and politics.
 Hershel “Woody” Woolard, founder of the Gold Star Family Memorial Fund, a 98 year-old WWII veteran and Congressional Medal of Honor recipient, explained that the Gold Star program began in World War I to recognize and honor mothers who’d lost their sons in the war. The program was restarted in World War II.
 Mr. Woolard explained that he felt that the program needed to recognize the sacrifice of the families as well. “You never had anyone say of the families of the fallen ‘he’s a gold star father or a gold star brother or sister,’” the retired Marine noted. Because of this absence of recognition he initiated the Gold Star Family Memorial program dedicated to honoring the families of those lost in service to the country.

Low budget carrier IndiGo's A320 aircraft had to be grounded due to bird hit on Sunday. The aircraft was operating as 6E 5047 from Mumbai to Delhi and returned minutes after take-off.


  The aircraft took off at around 8.05am, its scheduled departure time, but returned to Mumbai's Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) minutes later.


  The airline spokesperson person confirmed the incident and said, "IndiGo flight 6E 5047 operating from Mumbai to Delhi had to turn back to Mumbai due to a bird hit. An alternate aircraft was arranged to operate the flight from Mumbai to Delhi. We regret the inconvenience caused to passengers."


  The flight then took off at 10.45am after a delay of 2.45 hours with 67 passengers on board.


  Earlier on August 8, an AirAsia flight was forced to abort operations after it suffered a bird-hit during the take-off exercise at Ranchi airport. The flight i5-632 was to take off for Mumbai's CSMIA at around 11.50am. The airline had to arrange an alternate aircraft to accommodate the passengers.

Both consoles will also be on the same GPU platform, the new AMD Radeon RDNA 2, so this will also be similar. Looking at the specs reported by Sony and Microsoft, Microsoft's Xbox Series X GPU comes in at a lower clock speed but higher TFLOPs (trillion floating-point operations per second). This would mean the Xbox Series X GPU can crunch more numbers compared to the PS5. However, the Xbox Series S GPU comes in below everyone at 4TFLOPs to the Xbox Series X's 12 TFLOPS and the PS5's 10.3 TFLOPS. While on paper, the Xbox Series X wins the GPU metric, developers will still be working to extract the most performance and best visuals from each platform, so we double that there will be much practical difference between it and the PS5.

SINCE launching her first published work, award-winning Highfields cake decorator Mary Reid has decided to come out of retirement to offer cake decorating classes.
 Ms Reid, who is also a teacher, author and community advocate, released her book Caution! Wedding Cake on Board earlier this year and has since received high demand for her work to return to the community through teaching.
 Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Ms Reid found it fitting to be able to provide some joy through cake decorating for those who may be experiencing isolation.
 “If I can help make someone else follow their dream, even if we are in a pandemic, or if I am in retirement, then I am happy to do so,” she said.
 Collaborating with Toowoomba organisation Verity Rose Workshops, Merivale Cakes and Crafts will run 12 COVID-safe cake decorating workshops between October and April at Demolay House.
 The workshops will range from beginner to advanced, and include baking, traditional and modern skills, and include hobby to business skills.
 The cost of courses will be off-set by Bakels, Australia’s largest national baking and decorating manufacturer, who are sponsoring the workshops.
 Businesses involved in the classes include four times Australian Bridal Industry Academy wedding cake designer of the year award winner Caitlin Mitchell, COVID-19 assessed food business Michelle Cullen, and 2020 AusMumpreneur winner, Kat Lynn of Foodie Shots.
 With end-to-end COVID-safe plans in place as per Government requirements including social distancing and individualised tools and food packs, participants can be sure that they are working in a safe environment.
 Tickets to the first event this week have sold out, however keep and eye out on Verity Rose’s Facebook page for upcoming details on the remaining classes.

  “My feeling was that it was not an obvious, conventional move for him,” Hoffman said. “But at the same time I felt we had a concept we had been thinking about for a number of years that just might fit his interests. It just so happened that it was, item for item, exactly what Shep was looking for.”


  CNBC offers financial news during the day and general interest programs that appeal to an affluent audience at night, things like “Shark Tank,” “Jay Leno’s Garage” and “Secret Lives of the Super Rich.” The network needed something to serve as a bridge between the day and night identities, and thought a smart, straight newscast could do the trick, he said.


  “We really clicked at that first meeting,” Hoffman said. “It was one of those easy conversations. It wasn’t a sales pitch. We didn’t talk about what we wanted him to do. I just talked about what we wanted to do. We had a nice chemistry and our interests seemed to be aligned. I would say he left the meeting intrigued and then it moved from there.”

Organic soap is a soap that is made using natural and organic ingredients including plant-derived oils, essential oils, and glycerin, bee wax, honey, amla, aloe vera, among other ingredients. Organic soaps have certain healing properties that help to improve skin conditions such as acne and eczema, among other severe skin conditions. These soap bars have various properties such as they contain antioxidants, no chemicals or pesticides, natural antibacterial qualities, generally cruelty-free and environment-friendly, etc. Conventional soaps, on the other hand, are known to contain hazardous ingredients, questionable chemicals, and lathering agents that are harmful in the long run and may result in rashes and dry and flaky skin. In addition, the worst part is that the residues get drained in water system and release chemicals and toxins into the waterways, putting aquatic species in danger. For instance, according to a report published in the UK, chemicals, and substances from soap bars that are let into the ocean include parabens and phthalates. These strong chemicals are anticipated to lead to diseases that can affect both humans and animals, especially aquatic animals.

Lawyers for TikTok pleaded with a U.S. federal judge on Sunday to delay the Trump Administration’s ban of the popular video sharing program from app stores set to take effect at the end of the day, arguing the move would infringe on First Amendment rights and do irreparable harm to the business.


  The 90-minute hearing came after President Donald Trump declared this summer that TikTok was a threat to national security and that it either sold its U.S. operations to U.S. companies or the app would be barred from the country.


  TikTok, owned by Chinese company ByteDance, is scrambling to firm up a deal tentatively struck a week ago in which it would partner with tech company Oracle and retailer Walmart and that would get the blessing of the Chinese and American governments. In the meantime, it is fighting to keep the app available in the U.S.


  The ban on new downloads of TikTok, which has about 100 million users in the U.S, was delayed once by the government. A more comprehensive ban is scheduled for November, about a week after the presidential election. Judge Carl Nichols of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia said he would make a decision by late Sunday, leaving TikTok’s fate hanging.

 # UTEP takes huge step forward in Monroe to set up turnaround
 Bret Bloomquist
 El Paso Times
 UTEP football fundamentally changed Saturday at Louisiana-Monroe.
 A 31-6 victory that marked the most complete game, the best UTEP victory since 2016, could well mark the beginning of a new era, the day a corner was turned.
 Sure, perspective is needed. ULM, a decent team last year, isn't good. This UTEP win looked much like Texas State's victory over the Warhawks last week. Of course, Texas State took UTSA to double overtime, UTSA looks like an elite Conference USA team and there's some perspective.
 The Miners are now the only 3-1 college football team in the world.
 There is precedent for what UTEP is doing. A team that is supposed to be poor wins a couple of games against lower-level programs, convinces itself it is good and that belief morphs into reality.
 That process kicked into gear Saturday.
 Blowing out ULM on the road doesn't mean these Miners are a 10-win team, but it does mean most of the games left on their schedule are, on some level, winnable. Conference USA looks a little down this year, UTEP looks a lot up and it can legitimately contend.
 The theory for this Miner team taking a step forward in Dana Dimel's third year may have looked farfetched a month ago, but it was there.
 It went like this: Sophomore quarterback Gavin Hardison ends up being a solid C-USA quarterback; tailback Deion Hankins turns into another El Paso under- recruited gem; receivers Jacob Cowing and Justin Garrett take star turns; the influx of junior college talent on defense blossoms.
 That was a narrow path, but right now that looks like a slate full of check marks.
 The key to everything is Hardison. He was a productive 13-of-25 for 302 yards with no turnovers and on third down he was a lights-out 9-of-10 for 162 yards. Every one of those came on third-and-7 or longer and eight went for first downs.
 A team that gets that level of play at quarterback usually wins. A team with a 300-yard passer, a 100-yard rusher and two 100-yard receivers usually wins.
 A team that holds opponents to 0-11 on third down — the first recorded time in UTEP history it has held an opponent without a third-down conversion — always wins. The Miners pressured the quarterback, didn't let receivers get open downfield and held Louisiana-Monroe to 0.5 yards per rush.
 Looking ahead, the toughest game left on the schedule looks like the next one, against Louisiana Tech 30 miles miles down the road from Monroe. That's followed by four games against teams who haven't looked as good this year as UTEP. The Miners will be favored in some of these.
 A six- or seven-win bowl season is absolutely on the table, though there probably won't be a New Mexico Bowl this year for UTEP to grace.
 Games like Saturday's are where programs are forged, games that are circled, games where everything changes.
 That could well be what happened Saturday in Monroe.

Three years after taking to Hutchinson's streets in a little red food truck, entrepreneur Gina Emel plans to open a regular storefront location next week.


   


  "If you'd asked me last year if I'd open a brick and mortar store, I'd have answered no," said Emel, owner of The Traveling Bowl. "But it just kind of seemed like the next best step. I thought I wanted to have two food trucks, but after spending the winter with the trailer shut down and being in a kitchen, it seemed like that's the way to go."


   


  Emel, 32, is making the transition into the former Rita's Italian Ice building at 2221 N. Lorraine with the aid of a $7,000 loan from StartUp Hutch. The loan will help with expenses of the new equipment needed for the expansion, including the furnishing of a larger kitchen.


   


  "We regularly run out of food," said Emel. "It's a great problem to have, but we're also leaving money on the table when we don't have the capacity to serve everyone who would buy from us. The new kitchen and equipment will really help us grow."


   


  Along with the new location comes the addition of two new employees - one full- and one part-time - more seating for diners, and the addition of a drive-thru window.


   


  She plans to keep the trailer for catering weddings and other outdoor events and, if she's successful enough by next spring to hire more help, may put it back on the road.


   


  She'll maintain the name The Traveling Bowl since it refers to how she serves the home-style food.


   


  "Our bowls are convenient for on-the-go," she said. "They have lids and are microwave safe. We'll have drive-thru and carry out and a little bit of seating inside."


   


  The restaurant features a rotating menu of regular entrees, plus they'll continue to offer specials, she said.


   


  Hours will be 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Monday through Friday, though hours may also change.


   


  Emel's parents, Mary and the late Jack Emel, were longtime local restaurateurs, operating Prime Thyme on Main Street, Samplers out in the county and Mr. Steak in Wichita, among others.


   


  So, though she spent five years in supply chain management after graduating from the University of Kansas, Emel also found it as a calling.


   


  "In times of economic distress, there are still opportunities for job growth for people who are creative and willing to innovate," said Jackson Swearer, entrepreneur navigator and program director for StartUp Hutch.


   


  "Traveling Bowl is a great example of a small business making strides for sustained success and our organization was happy to help with funding," he said.

Their best bet is to plough the fields, and then clear out these roots through “raking”. But where would they get the tractors to do the ploughing? It would appear that these have either been allowed to rust by the PNC, cannibalised, or sent to the “grinding” estates. It’ll take time to get new tractors, so it makes sense, as has been announced, that this programme might be contracted out. It’s going to cost a pretty penny.

MumbaiLow budget carrier IndiGo's A320 aircraft had to be grounded due to bird hit on Sunday. The aircraft was operating as 6E 5047 from Mumbai to Delhi and returned minutes after take-off. The aircraft took off at around 8.05am, its scheduled departure time, but returned to Mumbai's Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) minutes later. The airline spokesperson person confirmed the incident and said, "IndiGo flight 6E 5047 operating from Mumbai to Delhi had to turn back to Mumbai due to a bird hit. An alternate aircraft was arranged to operate the flight from Mumbai to Delhi. We regret the inconvenience caused to passengers." The flight then took off at 10.45am after a delay of 2.45 hours with 67 passengers on board. Earlier on August 8, an AirAsia flight was forced to abort operations after it suffered a bird-hit during the take-off exercise at Ranchi airport. The flight i5-632 was to take off for Mumbai's CSMIA at around 11.50am. The airline had to arrange an alternate aircraft to accommodate the passengers.

Hendersonville's Ella Dockendorf had a successful multi-sport career at Carolina Day, and after graduating during the COVID-19 pandemic, she already had her college plans mapped out.


   


  Dockendorf, who was a member of the NCISAA All-State Soccer Team this season, was heading to St. Edwards University, a Division-II program located in Austin, Texas, to play soccer.


   


  But just a month away from move-in day, her plans changed.


   


  "It wasn't until about a month before move in day that St. Edwards announced that classes would be online, and there was a lot of speculation if the soccer season would happen at all," she said Friday.


   


  Dockendorf had been in talks with Brevard College at the time and learned that Brevard was having in-person classes and also had still had plans to have a soccer season.


   


  "So I talked to the coach, applied to the school and visited. About a week later I decided to attend," she said.


   


  And the BC soccer program welcomed her with open arms, she said.


   


  "Even though it was such a last-minute decision, everyone was super welcoming both on the soccer team and in the school community. It has been a pretty easy transition, partly because I am so close to home still," she said.


   


  BC's fall season was postponed by the pandemic, but the team is still holding regular practices and scrimmages in preparations for the spring in 2021.


   


  "There are allowed to be fans at the scrimmages right now, which is really fun because a lot of the other athletes will come out to support us as well as the players' families," Dockendorf said.


   


  During her junior year at Carolina Day, the soccer team made it all the way to the state finals. She was hoping to make it back again this year, but the COVID-19 pandemic allowed for the team to just get two matches in.


   


  She was also a key member of the school's cross country team, which won four straight state titles.


   


  While she could've easily earned a spot on both BC's cross country or track and field teams, Dockendorf said she's sticking to one sport.


   


  "As of right now I'm mainly focusing on soccer. However, I have been trying to take advantage of the amazing mountain biking in this area, but I just do that for fun and will not be competing. I have thought about running cross country, however we do plenty of running during our practices and I don't want to wear myself out," she said.


   


  BC women's soccer coach Juan Mascaro said he's happy to have a talent like Dockendorf on his team.


   


  "What sets Ella apart from your average soccer player is her soccer IQ. She has a tremendous soccer IQ and an exceptional understanding of the game," he said. "You can tell Ella has been very well coached both at Carolina Day School and with her club team in South Carolina. I really think her soccer IQ is off the charts and that she sees the game at a different level which puts us in a great position as a team.


   


  "It is great to see a local talent like Ella do well, especially right here in the Western North Carolina area."


   


  Mascaro said he's already seeing some leadership qualities in his newest team member.


   


  "She is going to bring strong leadership abilities to go along with her soccer ability. Ella is the complete package both as a soccer player and as a student-athlete," he said.

At the end of the year, I will rank the best 25 teams — with no bias whether they played 7, 8 or 10 games.”

Thanks to COVID-19, high school looks very different this year, but students at East Henderson High aren't letting a global pandemic stymie their school spirit.


   


  On Friday, students at East held a live, virtual pep rally via Instagram, featuring the Eagle mascot Swoop running around Hendersonville with a spirit stick to kick off the Olympic-themed event.


   


  The Student Government Association planned the pep rally to show the vibrant culture at East, said 17-year-old senior Jackie Mendez.


   


  Current circumstances may be keeping students out of school, she said, but "we still have our traditions, and our traditions are still alive."


   


  The live rally started Friday at 1 p.m. with Swoop running into the East gymnasium as cheerleaders performed and music played over the loudspeakers before a video showed the mascot at different locations around town.


   


  Student body President Joseph Sherer and Vice President Sammy Anchia served as emcees, introducing and explaining the events and scoring.


   


  The different Olympic-style competitions were filmed in advance, and were scored by placement for each class's team, with 3 points for fourth place, 5 points for third, 7 points for second and 10 for finishing first.


   


  Teams faced off throwing water balloons with soaped gloves, backing up each time a successful catch was made.


   


  Next came sharks and minnows, and finally an obstacle course relay where students ended up pieing teachers in the face.


   


  One of those competitors trying hard to pie teachers in the face was Wesley Allen, a 14-year-old freshman.


   


  "It was a big surprise, because I didn't know what I was getting into," he said.


   


  Allen participated in the relay race, which involved throwing dodgeballs into a can, hopping over to a station to crush a frozen rubber glove and find a small ball inside, then running to a teacher to put that ball in another can, getting a pie in return.


   


  The final step, and likely the most fun, was running with that pie to another waiting teacher and smashing it into their face before tagging the next member of their team.


   


  Allen made sure to take it easy on his future teachers, though.


   


  "I did it really nicely," he said. "I'm in ninth grade (and) didn't want to make any enemies."


   


  It was a nice break to take part in the pep rally. "It's pretty cool, because you get to do stuff that a lot of people aren't doing," Allen said.


   


  Sherer and Anchia brought up the class presidents at the end to announce the winners and award medals.


   


  First place went to the senior class, second to the sophomores, third to the juniors and fourth to the freshmen.


   


  It was a warm welcome for students who will be heading back to classrooms Monday for the start of Plan B's in-person learning.


   


  Mendez, a member of the SGA Planning Committee behind the pep rally, said the event meant a lot to students who were able to participate. She also mentioned the help from Media Coordinator and SGA Sponsor Katie Rogers, as well as Media Assistant Carrie Rowe.


   


  "To get this approved and to be able to work on it meant a lot," she said. "We know we're not going to have things how they were last year."


   


  The SGA worked for a couple of weeks on the pep rally, a difficult process with lots of effort put into including as many people as possible under the current restrictions, Mendez said.


   


  Students who did exceptionally well on the Plan C, virtual-only learning plan at the start of the school year were nominated by teachers to participate.


   


  Unfortunately, not all of those nominated were able to take part, but it was a success nonetheless, she said.


   


  During the events, it was fun to see the Eagle spirit and everyone cheering the participants on - not just their own teammates, Mendez said.


   


  The SGA tried hard to include as many people as possible and represent the very diverse group of students at East, she said.


   


  "I am so proud to even be in SGA," said Mendez, because of the way the organization is working to have things like the pep rally when many students are not able to go back to in-person classes.


   


  "Still being online is hard, but we're already able to work through it and we came out with this amazing idea and were able to get it approved and execute it," she said.


   


  Students at East have already missed events this year, Mendez added, and she hopes this pep rally gave the student body hope and brings up school spirit across the board, "showing everybody that we are Big East and all there together means the world."

It absolutely astonishes me that anyone supports President Trump.
   
 How can they justify the proven lies, the mockery of laws and rules that are meant to keep them safe, the continuous broken promises of reformed healthcare and the slaughtering of clean air and climate control reforms?
   
 This president has no compassion for life other than his own, proven by the fact that he is tested on a daily basis for COVID-19, but insists that everyone in America gets back to work and to school with no testing guidelines in place.
   
 How can people not realize that we are in this position of limited normal living expectations because of his failure to act when needed? He knew how deadly and infectious this virus was, but made the decision to downplay those facts to the American people causing 200,000 lives and counting.
   
 Even though it has been proven that wearing a face mask saves lives, he disputes that fact to this day, going so far as throwing the head of the CDC under the bus for stating that importance in a congressional hearing. He has even gone so far as to say that it was Joe Biden's responsibility to mandate mask-wearing laws!
   
 How do these egregious acts against our citizens just bounce off those same citizens like they don't matter? Have we really gotten to the point that the value of life, democracy, respect and morality have slipped down the importance list behind greed, money, guns and fear-mongering? Is the strength of our nation going to be determined by the people who do not accept responsibility or accountability for their actions? Do we really want to turn a blind eye to foreign interference in our elections, hush money payoffs, political cronyism that exonerates the guilty and blatant attempts to undermine our election processes?
   
 This country has become divided by the political colors of red and blue. Our support for political candidates is not expressed anymore in personal accomplishments or promises of reform from each candidate, but in the terms of how much tragic devastation will occur when the wrong party's candidate is elected. If you owned a business, would your application for employment ask what dirt do you have on fellow applicants?
   
 There are some glaring differences between Trump and Biden. It seems that Trump's platform is mainly based on law and order (which in the past meant using military force against American citizens), still promising that ever eluding healthcare plan (which should be a priority because he has all but eliminated the Affordable Cares Act), and restoring a once-thriving economy that he wrongly took credit for, but was responsible for its collapse.
   
 Biden, on the other hand, has laid out sound plans for healthcare reforms building on Obamacare, uniting America to rid this country of a crippling virus and an economic stimulus plan that taxes large corporations their just dues, the same corporations that loop-holed their way free and clear under Trump.
   
 Biden has stated that even though he is a Democrat, he will be a president of all the people. Trump, to the contrary, has proven time and time again that he only wants to represent "red" voters. He recently claimed that if we eliminated the "blue" states from our virus death counts, we would look very good compared to the rest of the world. What a joke!
   
 Make the move, America. Vote for a president that will unite this country, one that I can guarantee will never withhold or downplay any information that will cause the deaths of 200,000 people, will not refer to our military personnel as "jokes and losers" and will restore the respect and admiration of our world wide allies.
