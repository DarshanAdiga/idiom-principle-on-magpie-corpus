Given what has been discussed above, going online is the only way forward. Many people fear that doing things virtually is difficult and does not have the feel and experience of entertainment places but the experience of similar facilities in Europe should help us to know that this is the right way to go. Most of these games have an easy-to-understand interface. This makes playing easier for new players and people who are not very comfortable with internet devices and technology. Long-term players and those who are very good with computers will be aware of their positions, but for new people will need a little help. This can be done via social media support groups or a small manual on the website to help newcomers get used to the application interface. A study carried out in Tanzania recently found out that a person who can read and write can take up to a week to be fully comfortable with a platform’s interface. This then tells us that the future for online casinos is bright, what people need to do right now is to stay safe and get into the game when the right facilities are in place. In other words, this is the best time to go virtual and avoid unnecessary inconveniences that are common in shops and crowded places.

Cantrell administration officials said the lack of hard enforcement measures was a sign of success. Their goal was getting people to abide by the rules without the need for actually enacting harsh penalties.
 “Our Code Enforcement teams have largely achieved compliance by verbal warning, rather than shutdowns and citations,” Communications Director Beau Tidwell said. “By the same token, NOPD has limited their use of citations and punitive action in favor of direct address and verbal requests to large crowds. That is not to say that we will not issue citations in the future, but we are trying to use a nuanced approach to get the results that all of our citizens deserve.”
 Though it's difficult to measure how well cities are complying with measures such as mask wearing and social distancing to stem the coronavirus pandemic, New Orleanians have largely been seen as seen as more accepting of the recommendations of public health officials than residents of many other parishes. That might be due, in part, to the city's harsh exposure to the effects of the virus after Mardi Gras, when unmitigated spread left New Orleans with one of the highest infection and death rates in the country.
