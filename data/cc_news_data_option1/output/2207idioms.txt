In the wake of the police killing of George Floyd, Brees repeated his opposition to kneeling during the national anthem. And the biting backlash that followed prompted the Saints' star quarterback to issue a public apology Thursday in which he acknowledged he totally “missed the mark.”
 When Brees expressed his position on the anthem three years ago, he was one of many voices in a crowded conversation. But when he repeated it Wednesday, he learned in humbling fashion how times have changed.
 The intensity and frequency of protests stemming from Floyd’s killing less than two weeks ago have signified that wider segments of the U.S. population view police brutality and racial injustice as matters of greater urgency.
 “I recognize that I should do less talking and more listening,” Brees wrote in the apology posted on social media. “When the black community is talking about their pain, we all need to listen.”
 In 2017 many teams opted for anthem compromises that did not involve kneeling, even as they sought to carry forward former San Francisco quarterback Colin Kaepernick's protest of the same social issues that now surround Floyd's killing. Many teams opted to remain standing with locked arms, reminiscent of civil rights protests. The Saints, Brees included, chose to kneel moments before the anthem and then stand as it began.
 This week the same sentiment during a Yahoo Finance interview drew widespread condemnation. A number of high-profile athletes, including LeBron James, as well as several current and former teammates, teed off. Critics saw Brees' take as tone deaf amid ongoing emotional protests around the country that sometimes have devolved into violent and destructive riots.
 Saints safety Malcolm Jenkins called Brees “part of the problem,” in a video he posted on social media.
 Later Wednesday night in New Orleans — where Brees could seemingly do no wrong — marching protesters could be heard slandering the quarterback. Videos appeared on social media of people burning Brees' No. 9 Saints jerseys.
 Marc Morial, the National Urban League president and former New Orleans mayor, said in an email to the AP that while he has grown to respect Brees over his many years with the Saints, he found the quarterback’s comments to be "thoughtless.”
 “The events of the last few weeks have lent weight to the argument that it is the subject of the protest, rather than the method, that makes many Americans uneasy,” Morial said, adding that he appreciates Brees' willingness to reconsider his words and hopes it “leads to a productive dialogue among his peers.”
 While the apology was a first step, time will tell how well the 41-year-old Brees can repair relationships as what could be his final NFL season nears.
 New Orleans linebacker Demario Davis, an outspoken advocate for racial justice, suggested during a CNN interview that Saints players would be able to accept Brees' apology.
 "That is a form of true leadership,” Davis said. “That’s taking ownership. What we had hoped the first time was that Drew would elaborate more on racism and the sentiments of the black community. He admitted he missed the mark.
 “For him to come out and say ‘I missed the mark, I’ve been insensitive but what I’m going to start doing is listening and learning from the black community and finding ways that I can help them.’ I think that’s a model for all of America.”
 Saints receiver Michael Thomas also said on social media that he accepted Brees' apology.
 But this isn't the first time Brees' has found himself on the defensive for the way he chose to express his beliefs.
 Last year, the renowned religious family man took heat for recording a public service announcement promoting “Bring Your Bible to School Day” for the group Focus on the Family, which has actively campaigned against gay rights. Brees said he never meant to associate himself with anti-gay messaging and took issue with anyone who accused him of doing so. He also stood by his message in the video.
 Despite any missteps, Brees has been one of the most respected players in the NFL for reasons beyond his record-setting play on the field.
 He has dedicated untold hours and spent about $35 million on charitable contributions or commitments along the Gulf Coast since joining the Saints 2006, when he became a leading advocate for New Orleans’ recovery from Hurricane Katrina.
 Recently, he donated $5 million to coronavirus relief efforts in Louisiana.
 Brees' track record may be one reason Carolina Panthers’ tight end Chris Manhertz, a former Brees teammate in New Orleans, echoed Davis' sentiments.
 “It takes somebody of character to acknowledge that they’re wrong and they messed up in a way,” Manhertz said. “Everybody has their own perspective and I can’t take that away from him but it’s just a matter of acknowledging what is going on and being empathetic. Things like that go a long way in terms of understanding things that you may not have been exposed to or experienced.”
 That doesn't mean Brees still doesn't have more work to do to back up his empathetic shift in tone.
 “It's not just saying we want to change,” Davis said on CBS Sports Radio. “It's the actions that's actually going to allow us to change.”

Nighthawks and Late Walks took Nathan McKay around Stratford for his eighth full-length album.
 It started five years ago at Revel Caffe, where McKay wrote many of the songs and set up a portable studio. Madenell McIntosh was five at the time and was curious about what McKay was doing, and the local producer - under the moniker Resonating Ergonomics for this drum and bass project - invited her to join him for a song, and they did a jungle remix of Baa Baa Black Sheep.
 The lead single is 13 Ways to Groove, a jazzy collaboration with New Hamburg's Jessi Elgood, who often busks in front of the Avon Theatre.
 In the summer of 2018, McKay sat at the Play Me I'm Yours piano in downtown Stratford and used a microphone and laptop to record a song.
 "That was kind of a spontaneous thing that would not have happened had I been at home," he said. "Sometimes people would see what I was doing and wonder what I was up to, and it would advance the story of the music.
 "I kind of get that recharge being around people."
 The 39-year-old also worked with local DJ Rob Wigan and hip hop artist Nat Saturn to do a jungle remix of a Trent Severn song, which is a bonus track on the album.
 "It was a fun experience working with Rob," McKay said. "He's been one who's educated me a bit on this style of music over the years."
 McKay's first drum and bass album, inspired by Freaky Flow and London Elektricity, features 30 songs on Bandcamp, though for complicated copyright reasons only 27 songs appear on the iTunes and Spotify versions.
 "It's one foot in the past, and one foot in the future," he said.
 The album is "a combination of electronic and live instrumentation" and is part of a genre that's more popular in Europe than in North America. Think of it as funky, sped-up drums with intricate basslines, though it's not that simple when putting it together in a studio.
 "It's a very laborious genre because some songs can take 100 hours to finish … but it's fun," McKay said. "This (album) was maybe my favourite to make because it's one of my current favourite genres."
 McKay has sampled various musical styles in the past, and he's released around 300 songs since 2012. In addition to the albums, he's put out several EPs (four to seven songs).
 Since a pandemic changed the physical-distancing rules, McKay and Saturn have been releasing a single every two weeks. The duo has already collaborated on one hip hop album, and they've got enough material for two more.
 The next one should be released once they can connect in person with collaborators in different parts of the world. Until then, McKay - who also works three day jobs - is using his free time to focus on his passion.
 "This opportunity is kind of like a frown upside down … but it's certainly boosted our creativity (finishing some songs)," McKay said. "It's been a very productive season."

 MUSTANG, Okla. (AP) \u2014 Authorities are investigating a fatal police shooting in suburban Oklahoma City. Officers from the Mustang police department found an individual who had been suspected of driving under the influence at a parking lot Friday evening, according to the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation. Police said the individual was fatally shot after he \u201cpresented a firearm.\u201d The individual died at the scene and a firearm was found in the parking lot, according to the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation. The state agency said it will present the findings of its investigation to prosecutors, who will determine if any charges will be filed in the shooting.

Police presence at the event included the Angels Camp Police Department, the Calaveras County Sheriff’s Office, and the Tuolumne County Sheriff’s Office, with the California Highway Patrol, the San Joaquin Sheriff’s Office and Cal Fire personnel reportedly providing assistance.
 However, the majority of demonstrators were gone by 6 p.m., well before the city's precautionary 8 p.m. curfew. Some lingered to clean up any trash on their way out.
 “We are here not only to protest George Floyd’s murder and the lack of accountability in police forces, but we’re also here to remember every single black person who has died unjustly,” 19-year-old Loomis told the crowd through a megaphone at the beginning of the event.
 “It goes to show that Calaveras County is not what people think it is,” 18-year-old Lowell added. “We have people that want to be better. We have people that are showing everyone else out there that black lives matter, and no one should die at the hands of police.”
 Demonstrators were instructed to be “the love crowd” and blow kisses at those who drove by screaming obscenities and “all lives matter.” Yet the majority of reactions from passersby were enthusiastic honks as the crowd grew to encompass all four corners of the intersection, stretching to the CVS Pharmacy parking lot.
 Further down the road, a smaller gathering formed outside of Swendeman Hardware. When asked by an Enterprise reporter why they chose to stand there, one man answered that they were “just protecting the town” but declined to comment further. The group turned away when asked to be photographed.
 However, a woman named Jodie Brixey, who claimed to be part of that group, later commented on Facebook that they had not been there for protection but were rather “looking at a building that was just purchased” and had stopped to watch the protest.
 “This is absolutely false reporting!” she wrote.
 A second protest is planned for Saturday at 1 p.m., starting at the same location and moving down the roadside to Utica Park. Organizer Kassidi James, of Angels Camp, said she planned the demonstration after she heard that Lowell and Loomis’ event had been cancelled due to alleged threats from the public. She said she is expecting as many as 300 people to attend.
 “You can never speak on this enough,” she said.
 Longtime Calaveras County residents Nate and Chelsea Frazier brought their two young children to participate in Friday’s protest. Nate Frazier, an artist and entrepreneur, said that he and his wife have chosen to raise their children in the community despite the unique challenges he's faced as a black man living in a predominantly white region.
 “There’s a lot of things that are better now than they were, (but) I would be lying if I said there were not extreme struggles (and) discrimination in different areas of life,” Frazier said. “But we are still here because of the love we have for this community. There are wonderful people here. … Honestly, any chance I see Calaveras coming together to unify and embrace diversity, I’m all for it.”

Wednesday’s christening of the WE League was a key step for the new competition, which will open in September 2021 with between 6-10 teams.
 The name is catchy enough (so long as it’s pronounced “we” rather than “W.E.”), even if what it stands for — “Women Empowerment League” — sounds like it was ripped from a Powerpoint presentation at a corporate seminar.
 The presentation also leaves much to be desired, with a simple black logo emphasizing “.WE” next to a much smaller “League.” According to former Nadeshiko Japan head coach Norio Sasaki, the dot is intended to represent a soccer ball as well as the Hinomaru (rising sun) of the Japanese flag.
 “Personally, the name and logo are well-intentioned but it risks slipping into empty gestures and lip-service if the league itself doesn't actually do what it says: empower women,” Australian soccer writer Samantha Lewis told From the Spot.
 In its release, the JFA unveiled a bold vision of having the best women’s soccer, the most active community of women and the most valuable league in the world. Officials have previously declared their intent to set quotas on professional contracts as well as the number of women hired for backroom and executive positions.
 “The birth of the WE League will mean that women’s soccer can be established as a profession and the dreams of young girls can be recognized,” said Sasaki, who led Nadeshiko Japan to glory at the 2011 FIFA Women’s World Cup and silver in London 2012, in a statement. “That will form the nucleus around which other roles will be created, and there will be more opportunities for (women) who want to make a living (in soccer).
 “I hope everyone involved in the league works together to create a ‘mutual’ positive energy that ripples through society. That’s what I want our league to embody.”
 Even before the pandemic that might have been a tall order, but now the JFA will be tested to deliver on its promises without as comfortable a financial footing as it might have previously expected.
 “It's easy to say all the right things when there's nothing actually at risk yet,” said Lewis,” But what matters is whether they will stick by these empowerment principles in the years ahead once they're forced to reckon with the financial realities of the women's game in a post-COVID world.”
 Much of the WE League’s early momentum could hinge on outside factors, such as Nadeshiko Japan’s success at the Olympics and the country’s ongoing bid to host the 2023 Women’s World Cup.
 “In addition to launching a pro league, Nadeshiko Japan winning a medal at the Tokyo Olympics and Japan earning the right to host the 2023 Women’s World Cup will be very important toward spreading women’s soccer in Japan,” JFA President Kozo Tashima said during Wednesday's news conference according to according to NHK.
 “Lining those up would be the best scenario. Once FIFA’s inspection team releases its report we can calculate our chances of winning the bid.”
 That report, scheduled to be released next week, will be a last chance to ascertain the strength of the four remaining bids before the FIFA Council makes its decision on June 25.
 While Colombia and Brazil are still in the running, a more plausible scenario is that Japan and the joint Australia-New Zealand bid will emerge as front- runners.
 Of those two, the joint bid has gained most of the momentum in the public sphere with its strong social media outreach and endorsements from many leading players and officials in the region.
 While FIFA’s inspections took place over the winter before the brunt of the coronavirus pandemic halted sports competitions and international travel around the world, the Oceanian “As One 2023” bid could receive a further boost from how both countries have adeptly managed the crisis.
 The pandemic gave Football Federation of Australia a chance to show off its organizing skills when it stepped in on short notice to host an Olympic women’s soccer qualifying group that had to be relocated from Wuhan, China.
