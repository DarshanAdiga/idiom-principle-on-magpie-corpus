 Braithwaite struck again in the 70th minute from the penalty spot while substitute Antoine Griezmann got the fourth goal in added time, rounding off a victory which took Group G leaders Barca on to 12 points from four games and clinched their place in the last 16.
 With his team on the verge of qualifying from the group and reeling from Saturday's 1-0 defeat to Atletico Madrid in La Liga, coach Ronald Koeman made eight changes to his side, including keeping captain Messi and Dutch midfielder Frenkie de Jong at home.
 French forwards Griezmann and Ousmane Dembele were also left out of the starters as Barca named their youngest starting 11 in a Champions League game in nine years, with an average age of 24.
 Gerard Pique's serious knee injury against Atletico left Barca with only one fit central defender and Koeman was forced to turn to 21-year-old Mingueza, who began the season in the club's reserve side.
 U.S forward Konrad de la Fuente and Brazilian midfielder Matheus Fernandes also made their first-team debuts, coming off the bench late in the game.
 Barca produced a sluggish performance in the first half and a tame effort from Philippe Coutinho was their only shot on target, but they found their composure after the break and soon outclassed their hosts.

The phrase "I'm with Batka", using the president's folksy moniker, refers to a top-down attempt during the protests to launch a civic movement in support of Lukashenka. While the authorities have suggested that the group, all in plain clothes, were merely "concerned citizens", the exact identity of Bondarenka's attackers remains unknown.

An inexperienced Barcelona side missing Lionel Messi and many other first-team regulars eventually cruised to a 4-0 win away to Dynamo Kyiv on Tuesday to reach the Champions League knockout stages for the 17th consecutive season.
 After a sluggish first half, the Catalans took the lead early in the second half as U.S international Sergino Dest completed a flowing move to score his first goal for the club since joining from Ajax Amsterdam in the close season.
 Danish forward Martin Braithwaite soon doubled their lead with his first goal in Europe's top competition at the age of 29, diving in from close range to turn in a flicked header from debutant defender Oscar Mingueza.
 Braithwaite struck again in the 70th minute from the penalty spot while substitute Antoine Griezmann got the fourth goal in added time, rounding off a victory which took Group G leaders Barca on to 12 points from four games and clinched their place in the last 16.

Now a few final summary comments from me on revenue, cost reduction, and cash generation before I hand it over to Dan. Our very low business levels in the second half of 2020 -- fiscal 2020 were challenging and resulted in an unprecedented step down in revenue levels. We continue to monitor the respective markets and look for favorable signs of the recovery. I'll point out that our order entry has begun to improve and move in the right direction from the very low levels we saw in May and June, to a slightly higher level in Q4. While we have a long way to go, it is certainly a step in the right direction.

"I would say probably if it wasn't for the pandemic, I wouldn't probably have changed my mind," Kanaan said during a Tuesday conference call. "There were some talks about doing the (Indianapolis) 500 and on and off and this and that, but I wasn't clear.
 "That (2020) was not the way I wanted to go out, and I was fully aware that this is what I wanted, but that didn't mean it was going to happen."  
 That's because Kanaan had already sold 2020 as his last lap and that's how he sold the season to sponsors NTT, Big Machine Records, Bryant and 7-Eleven. Even if Ganassi offered the four races to Kanaan, he would need to sell it and he had already told his sponsors he was leaving.
 They all decided to come back too, so Kanaan will share the No. 48 with Johnson, who will drive the remaining road and street course events.

 "Jimmie had to get his deal first, which we didn't even know if it was going to be Ganassi at the time. Yeah, the deal happened really quick, but we (had) been talking about this on and off for quite a while.
 "I had actually said, 'argh,' that this was never going to happen. It was the pessimistic side of me thinking it was going to be impossible to pull it off."

A total of 1,573 Kentuckians are currently hospitalized due to COVID-19. Of them 391 are in the ICU and 203 on a ventilator. The state’s positivity rate, based on a rolling average over the past seven days, dipped below nine percent Monday, to 8.97%.
 There were also five more deaths announced on Monday, raising to 1,792, the number of Kentuckians who have lost their lives to the coronavirus in Kentucky. The latest victims include a 73-year-old woman from Fayette County; a 73-year-old man from Harlan County; two men, ages 85 and 88, from McCracken County; and a 77-year-old man from Webster County.
 State Public Health Commissioner Dr. Steven Stack updated Kentuckians on contact tracing, COVID-19 clusters and new projections that account for Gov. Beshear’s additional restrictions.
 “Contact tracing has a number of different purposes: case investigation, helping connect Kentuckians to helpful resources they need, contact notification and providing information about quarantining,” said Dr. Stack. “Recent models show that just for Jefferson County and 14 surrounding counties, if we had complete compliance with new requirements, we could prevent almost 1,000 additional deaths by mid-January. Even with low compliance, 513 deaths would be prevented.”

"The White House supports the things we have done and hopefully the things that we're gonna have to do," he said. "This isn't a red state, blue state, Democrat, Republican, liberal, conservative, any of that. It's a virus that's coming for everybody it can."
 Kentucky has been in the red zone for case numbers, indicating 101 or more new cases per 100,000 people, every week since the Sept. 27 report, but this is the first time the White House has put Kentucky in the most dangerous zone for positivity, meaning it now has a rate at or above 10.1%.
 Beshear has noted several times that the state uses a different data stream than the White House, which results in a lower positivity rate. But the bottom line is that the rate keeps going up in both the state and federal report -- and that's reason for concern.
 The White House reports a 12.5 percent positivity rate in Kentucky. On Nov. 18, the state reported that rate to be 9.1%, the highest it's been since testing became widely available in the state.
 "Remember when we had it under 4 and we were concerned when it went up to 5?" Beshear asked at his daily briefing. "This is a very dangerous territory."
 The White House report, which covers Saturday, Nov. 7 to Friday, Nov. 13, says Kentucky ranks 24th highest in the country for cases and 20th for positivity.
 The report says 89% of Kentucky's counties had a moderate or high level of community transmission, with 55% of them having high levels.

It shows Kentucky with 344 new cases per 100,000 people. A jump from 274 per 100,000 in the prior week and 257 per 100,000 the week before. The national average is 294 per 100,000.
 The number of counties in the red zone increased by a whopping 27 counties, from 39 to 66; the orange zone increased by one county, to 24. Many if not most of those came from the yellow zone, which decreased by 17 counties, from 32 to 17.
 The report stresses that "mitigation efforts need to be increased" and suggest "limiting restaurant indoor capacity to less than 25% and limiting bar hours until cases and test positivity decrease to the yellow zone."
 Beshear is expected to place additional restrictions on bars and restaurants today at his daily briefing. They are currently allowed to operate at 50% capacity.
 The report calls on the state to recruit "local influencers" to message the importance of wearing a mask in pubic, to stop all gatherings beyond immediate households until both cases and positivity rates are in the yellow zone, and to get a flu shot.
 It calls for active testing in K-12 schools, calls on teachers and students to wear masks, and for schools to "consider pausing extracurricular school activities, even though athletics are not transmission risks, as the surrounding activities are where transmission is occurring."
 The report also asks colleges and universities to encourage their students to not let their guards down as Thanksgiving break approaches, and to follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention holiday guidelines if they are going home.
 The CDC guidance says, "People who do not currently live in your housing unit, such as college students who are returning home from school for the holidays, should be considered part of different households. In-person gatherings that bring together family members or friends from different households, including college students returning home, pose varying levels of risk."
 Kentucky's recent surge is part of a national one.

Before he goes behind bars, he explicitly tells Bepo to keep this from Luffy and the others. As Bepo laments what happened, Hawkins tortures Law for as much information about Luffy as possible.

And a win here means as much as in any other year.
 "Competition-wise, by no means should anyone state this season as an 'asterisk' season," said Liaw. "For teams to pivot and change from a typical eight-round series, single competition round weekends, at eight venues over 30 weeks, to the modified eight-round series, double header competitions weekends, at four venues, over 13 weeks… Getting a competition car through a 32-car bracket in one weekend is tough enough but to then get that same car ready for competition in less than 24 hours to do it all over again was a huge feat."
 And for next year, with so much still up in the air?
 "We are set to go to Englishtown, Road Atlanta, Orlando Speedway and World Wide Technology Raceway, dates to be set," Liaw said. "Long Beach, Irwindale and Evergreen Speedway are on our priority list, but they will be dependent on local regulations to see if we can have fans. We are close to a plan A and plan B schedule, very close."

Yes. Let me get some facts here, Chris. The best way that I like to look at this is our book-to-bill and it's kind of interesting. When you look at pounds on what we book versus what we bill in Q1, obviously, pre-pandemic, it was at 1.0, I'll get to the markets in a second, Q2 was 0.7, Q3 was 0.6, Q4 bounced back a little, which obviously gives us some hope, it was at 0.9. And to specifically answer your question on the book-to-bill arrow, we're still down. It was at 0.7 book-to-bill for the quarter, but CPI was slightly over 1, IGT was slightly under 1, and other was over 1. So it's -- arrow was lagging as we would expect, as we talked about with inventory, but the others are coming back. Again, we've got a long, long way to go. We say we're in the road to recovery, but it's from very low levels,

"You know, it's funny--when you're kind to people and you're thoughtful and you communicate well and you lay out what your goals are and you're respectful of their goals, magically, business is a lot easier. When you go into business with very much of 'What can I get out of it? How's this going to work for me, singularly?' in any business, it usually doesn't work out," he said. "And the FOX relationship has been one of those ones where they're always thinking about me before I'm even thinking about me. I love it."
 Racers would love it if the NHRA raised purses or at least restored them to pre-pandemic levels. But Lemonis isn't going to wave a wand and fix that issue right away.
 "You know, that's not up to me," he said. "I would have to learn more myself about that. I think a lot's going to depend on what happens and when are we going back full-throttle and when are people going to go back in the stands, because it's just probably a pretty simple math equation."
 When the 2021 season opens at the March 11-14 Gatornationals at Gainesville, Fla., Lemonis will experience for the first time this sensory-overload spectacle he has joined.
 "I've never been, and I'm excited to go to the first one as we start the season. It'll be my first time," he said.
 Can "The Profit" himself help take the NHRA to new heights? Should the NHRA make room at the table for Marcus Lemonis as the sanctioning body moves forward? Join in the discussion in the comments section below. If you haven't registered to jump in, there's no time like the present!
