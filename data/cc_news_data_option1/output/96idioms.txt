El pasado 2019 fue el año mas calido en Europa registrado hasta la fecha, asi como el segundo año mas calido a nivel mundial, segun informo ayer el Servicio de Cambio Climatico de Copernico (C3S). El conjunto de datos de temperatura proporcionado por este organismo muestra que la temperatura promedio global del aire en la superficie fue 0,04°C mas baja que en 2016, el año mas calido registrado hasta el momento en el mundo.
 Los datos tambien muestran que los cinco años mas calidos de la historia fueron los ultimos cinco, con 2019 como el segundo mas calido, con una temperatura de cerca de 0,6°C mas calido que el promedio 1981-2010. Tambien 2010-2019 se alza como la decada mas calida registrada hasta el momento.
 La temperatura promedio de los ultimos cinco años fue entre 1,1 y 1,2°C mas alta que el nivel preindustrial definido por el Grupo Intergubernamental de Expertos sobre el Cambio Climatico (IPCC) de la Organizacion de Nacionales Unidas.
 Asimismo, el mes de diciembre de 2019 estuvo a la par de diciembre de 2015 en cuanto a temperatura, lo que hace que estos dos meses sean los diciembres mas calidos en el registro de datos. En concreto, diciembre de 2019 fue 0,7°C mas calido que el promedio de diciembre del periodo entre 1981 y 2010.
 Segun los datos de Copernico, el calentamiento mas pronunciado en comparacion con el promedio de 1981-2010 ocurrio en Alaska y en otras grandes partes del Ártico. La mayoria de las areas terrestres eran mas calidas que el promedio, especialmente el este y el sur de Europa, el sur de África y Australia. En contraste, el centro y sureste de Canada experimentaron temperaturas anuales por debajo del promedio.
 En cuanto a Europa, todas las estaciones fueron mas calidas de lo habitual, siendo el verano y el otoño los cuartos mas calidos registrados, segun informo ayer este organismo. Ninguna de las estaciones fue record en terminos de temperatura promedio, pero Europa, sin embargo, registro su año mas calido.
 La temperatura media de diciembre de 2019 en Europa fue 3,2°C mas calida que la del periodo de referencia estandar (1981-2010), por lo que es el diciembre mas calido registrado en el viejo continente, aunque por un margen estrecho.
 Ante todo esto, Jean-Noel Thepaut, director de Ecmwf Copernico advierte de que los datos publicados ayer "son signos indudablemente alarmantes". Los resultados estan en linea con las proyecciones realizadas anteriormente por la Organizacion Meteorologica Mundial (OMM), que estimo que pasado año podria convertirse en el segundo o tercer año mas caluroso desde que hay registros.
 Por otro lado, el Servicio de Cambio Climatico de Copernico, junto con el Servicio de Monitoreo de la Atmosfera de Copernico (CAMS) „ambas de la Union Europea„, aseguran que las concentraciones de dioxido de carbono (CO2) en la atmosfera siguieron aumentando durante el pasado 2019, lo que confirma tambien la prediccion de la OMM y del Proyecto Global de Carbono (BPC).
 La tasa de crecimiento anual promedio estimada del pasado año fue mayor que la tasa de crecimiento en 2018, pero menor que la de 2015, año en que se produjo un evento fuerte de _El Ni ño_, que se tradujo en una mayor tasa de crecimiento atmosferico debido a una absorcion mas debil de lo normal de CO2 atmosferico por la vegetacion terrestre, y debido tambien a grandes emisiones de dioxido de carbono de incendios forestales, por ejemplo en Indonesia.
 Expertos reunidos en la pasada Cumbre del Clima de Madrid alertaron sobre los efectos del aumento progresivo de la temperatura en la Tierra e instan a tomar medidas para frenar el calentamiento global.

After the throw, the ax must be returned manually - the boomerang effect is not automatic. This opens up the potential for many ligaments and makes Leviathan a tool rather than a weapon for slaughter. You can throw it on a large scale into a particularly nasty creature, turning it into a block of ice. While one enemy is immobilized, stun and tear in half the second. And then - to run away, in a jump, return Leviathan to the hand and chop on the ground, causing a large ice explosion. Beauty! True, sometimes you forget that the enchanted ax does not live its own life, and because of this you get stuck in stupid situations, but, as for me, this is a plus. More impressions.

This is generally another game in which familiar motives are constantly guessed.

Despite such conciliatory talk, the region remained on edge, and American troops including a quick-reaction force dispatched over the weekend, were on high alert. Last week Iranian-backed militia besieged the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, and Tehran’s proxies in the region remain able to carry out attacks such as the one on Dec. 27 that killed a U.S. contractor and set off the most recent round of hostilities..
 And there was no obvious path to diplomatic engagement, as Trump pledged to add to his “maximum pressure” campaign of economic sanctions. He said the new, unspecified sanctions would remain in place “until Iran changes its behavior.”
 Iran’s Supreme LeaderAyatollah Ali Khamenei said the overnight strike was not necessarily the totality of Iran’s response.
 “Last night they received a slap,” Khamenei said. “These military actions are not sufficient (for revenge). What is important is that the corrupt presence of America in this region comes to an end.”
 Trump, facing perhaps the biggest test of his presidency, credited the minimized damage to an early warning system “that worked very well” and said Americans should be “extremely grateful and happy” with the outcome.
 The strikes had pushed Tehran and Washington perilously close to all-out conflict and left the world waiting to see whether the American president would respond with more military force. Trump, in his nine-minute, televised address, spoke of a robust U.S. military with missiles that are “big, powerful, accurate, lethal and fast.” But then he added: “We do not want to use it.”
 Iran for days had been promising to respond forcefully to Soleimani’s killing, but its limited strike on two bases — one in the northern Iraqi city in Irbil and the other at Ain al-Asad in western Iraq — appeared to signal that it, too, was uninterested in a wider clash with the U.S. Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted that the country had “concluded proportionate measures in self-defense.”
 Trump, who is facing reelection in November, campaigned for president on a promise to extract the United States from “endless wars.”
 On Wednesday, he said the United States was “ready to embrace peace with all who seek it.” That marked a sharp change in tone from his warning a day earlier that “if Iran does anything that they shouldn’t be doing, they’re going to be suffering the consequences, and very strongly.”
 Members of Congress were briefed on the Iran situation Wednesday afternoon in closed-door sessions on Capitol Hill, where Democrats expressed dissatisfaction with the administration’s justifications for the drone strike on Soleimani.
 Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut said he asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo if the administration had a Plan B in case tensions with Iran continued to escalate.￼
 “He had no answer about Plan B,” Himes said.
 Trump opened his remarks at the White House by reiterating his promise that “Iran will never be allowed to have a nuclear weapon.” Iran had announced in the wake of Soleimani’s killing that it would no longer comply with any of the limits on uranium enrichment in the 2015 nuclear deal crafted to keep it from building a nuclear device.
 The president, who had earlier pulled the U.S. out of the deal, seized on the moment of calm to call for negotiations toward a new agreement that would do more to limit Iran’s ballistic missile programs and constrain regional proxy campaigns like those led by Soleimani.
 Trump also announced he would ask NATO to become “much more involved in the Middle East process.” While he has frequently criticized NATO as obsolete and has encouraged participants to increase their military spending, Trump has tried to push the military alliance to refocus its efforts on modern threats.
 Like the U.S. troops in the region, NATO forces have temporarily halted their training of Iraqi forces and their work to combat the Islamic State.
 Soleimani’s death last week in an American drone strike in Baghdad prompted angry calls for vengeance and drew massive crowds of Iranians to the streets to mourn him. Khamenei himself wept at the funeral in a sign of his bond with the commander.
