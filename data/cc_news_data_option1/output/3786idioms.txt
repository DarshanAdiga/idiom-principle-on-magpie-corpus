As a refresher, the Galaxy Z Flip looks closer to a traditional flip phone that folds in half into a more pocketable size. The centerpiece here is a tall AMOLED screen on the inside that folds horizontally, while you've got a tiny outer display to glance at your notifications. The Z Flip still holds up well even with its slightly older but capable Snapdragon 855+ chip. It has already seen an iterative upgrade, but not a whole lot has changed, except for the addition of 5G using the new Snapdragon 865+ processor.

“It’s been kind of a crazy couple of weeks,” Coscarella said, noting that CHSAA’s original schedule had a moratorium in place where no sports would be played during two months when cases of COVID-19 were expected to rise. The fall football season will now take place during that period.


  “It’s odd that it got brought back up,” Coscarella said.


  After learning of the possibility to play in the fall, however, Coscarella said he spoke with Andrea Carlstrom, Chaffee County public health director, Superintendent David Blackburn, head football coach Matt Luttrell, CHSAA officials, numerous other athletic directors and some local doctors.


  The issue was also discussed at a community leadership roundtable Thursday with various leaders from the county and local municipalities.


  “From what I understand, the two superintendents (in Salida and Buena Vista), athletic directors and Andrea were all on the same page about what our priorities should be,” said county commissioner Greg Felt, who was part of the roundtable.


  “Technically it was not our decision; it was the school’s and public health’s, but I thought the logic was sound.”


  “They said wait until spring because they didn’t want to add risk to having schools open,” Coscarella said. “If it were allowed, we would have played in the fall.”


  Buena Vista will also wait and play in the spring.


  In class 2A, about half of the schools decided to play now while the other half will wait and play in the spring. Both seasons will crown state champions.


  Montezuma-Cortez, however, is Salida’s only league opponent that also opted to play in the spring so it’s unclear how the season will be structured at this point. CHSAA has also taken the lead in scheduling football seasons.


  By waiting, however, the Spartans also get some extra time to prepare for the season.


  “We have a young team so it’s an opportunity for us to get bigger, stronger, faster,” Luttrell said. “We have a good shot to do something good with this group.”


  Sideline spirit also got the option to resume this fall. With no sports to cheer for until basketball season, however, Coscarella said he gave the team the option to start having some open gyms, but it won’t start official practices yet.


  The 15 teams who play field hockey, meanwhile, came to a consensus to play the sport in the spring.


  “We’re trying to mitigate risks and it’s tough,” Felt said. “Should we send these kids to community X, let them mix it up for a couple of hours and then get back on the bus to come home?


  “We have no idea how (other communities) are handling (the pandemic). There are variables we just don’t know.”


  The spring football season will begin with practices on Feb. 22. First games can be held March 11 while the state championship will take place May 8.


  “It’s going to be different, but it’s going to be fine,” Luttrell said.

The 2020 NFL season may be well underway, but the coronavirus pandemic has impacted the league big time, both on and off the field.


  It didn't take us long to notice the off-field impact given that very few teams have allowed fans to attend their home games this year, and the franchises that have opened their gates have only welcomed in a very small percentage of their stadium's capacity.


  National Football League owners are billionaires or multi, multi-millionaires who sit upon a Mount Everest-like pile of money thanks to the league's lucrative television contracts, so most of that off-field impact has been felt by the fans who either can't attend their favourite team's home games or are missing the crowd noise while watching on TV.

Human beings have been developing their societies at an extraordinary pace, expanding in every realm at unprecedented speed. It is as if we have built the fastest race car ever imagined and are driving it through unknown, unmarked terrain. But we never bothered to equip the car with airbags. We didn't get insurance. We have not even put on our seat belts. The engine runs hot. Parts overheat and sometimes even catch fire. There have been some crashes, each one a bit worse than the last. So we douse the vehicle, tune up the suspension, repair the bodywork and resolve to do better. But we race on, and soon we are going faster and faster, into newer and rougher terrain. It's getting very risky out there. It's time to install those airbags and buy some insurance. And above all, it's time to buckle up.

The South Korean presidential office Cheong Wa Dae demonstrated Monday its commitment to reforming the police, the prosecution and the National Intelligence Service (NIS) according to plan and completing it by the end of the term at a meeting presided over by President Moon Jae-in. As the right to investigation, which has been a bone of contention, has mostly moved to the police, the main question has become who should take control of police investigations.      In the meeting, the government reiterated that it would create a national investigation team, which will be tasked with overseeing police investigations. It added it would guarantee the new team independence by preventing the police commissioner from exerting influence over individual cases. It appears that the government is barking up the wrong tree or it is trying to pull the wool over the public’s eyes.      The presidential office and the Ministry of Justice have been appointing those in favour of them as key officials in the prosecution. On the other hand, those who have been involved in investigations into the incumbent administration have been demoted, which resulted in the cases losing momentum. The independence of the new investigation team hinges on whether or not the government cherry-picks who is going to be in charge of the team. It does not matter if the police commissioner has the right to investigation or not.      As for the reform in the NIS, it was a step in the right direction to reduce the right to collect information as it can prevent the agency from meddling in national politics. However, it is worrying that the right to communism-related investigations will be handed over to the police as it could compromise national security. Intelligence and investigations go hand in hand, which means communism-related investigations will not be as effective with one agency collecting information and another conducting investigation. It would also give too much power to the police, which runs counter to the aim of the reform to distribute power.      There is also a controversy surrounding Justice Minister Choo Mi-ae’s presence in Monday’s meeting, especially because no new information was shared in the meeting. The presidential office explained that it was already planned, but some argue that it was to show support for Minister Choo who is alleged to abuse her influence for her son when he was serving in the military.      So far, the prosecution reform has been more about who will be given more authority rather than enhancing independence and political neutrality of the prosecution. The police are already more susceptible to political influence. If nothing is done to fix these issues, the ongoing reform is highly likely to result in less independence of law enforcement agencies and gaps in investigations into crimes and communism.

If you live here, you need to be counted.


  Unfortunately, many of us aren’t. Certain communities — such as rural, Black, Indigenous, Latinx, immigrant, and LGBTQ folks — are especially likely to be undercounted. Some experts warn this year’s census could be the worst undercount of Black and Latinx people in 30 years.


  When communities are undercounted, they’re drained of their political representation and their resources. We can’t let that happen.


  The more people your state counts, the more seats it gets in Congress. That gives your state — and you — a bigger say in making laws and selecting the president through the Electoral College. If you don’t get counted, you get less say.


  The census also determines how the federal government spends about $1.5 trillion every year on programs like food stamps, unemployment, housing assistance, education, infrastructure projects, and Medicare and Medicaid.


  During a pandemic and recession, states need every last dime to support these programs. If you’re uncounted, your state gets shortchanged — which could be especially devastating during a pandemic and recession.


  Unfortunately, 13 out of the 15 poorest states have a lower response rate now compared to the previous census count in 2010. That means the most vulnerable communities, including those hard-hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, are at risk of losing out on crucial support for recovery efforts.


  There are poor counties in Mississippi and Louisiana, for example, where census response rates are as low as 30 percent. In West Virginia, response rates in some counties are hovering at around 23 percent. And in one poor New Mexico county, the response rate is just 18 percent.


  Rates are even lower on many tribal lands. At the Jicarilla Apache reservation in New Mexico and the Crow and Northern Cheyenne reservations in Montana, they’re under 15 percent. At the Gila River and Fort Apache reservations in Arizona, and the Red Lake reservation in Minnesota, they’re in the single digits.


  An undercount won’t just harm these communities this year or next, but for a full decade into the future.


  Please encourage anyone and everyone you know to take the census, especially if you are from a marginalized community. Taking the census will ensure you, your loved ones, and your neighbors get their fair share of federal funding — and representation in our democracy.


  You matter. Your presence here matters. As peculiar as it may sound, you could save your life and livelihood, or your neighbor’s, just by filling out your census form.


  Let’s ensure all of our communities are represented fairly and funded equitably. Let’s fill out the census.

  For some people, this is exciting technology, and to pair it with the classic style of a brand such as Ray-Ban is a no-brainer.


  advertisement


  They'd be right.


  From a Facebook perspective, this makes total sense. The fashionable halo that would hover on the decades-long reputation and popularity of Wayfarers and Aviators could give any new venture a substantial boost. Facebook is tapping into decades of accumulated cool built by everyone from Bob Dylan to Andy Warhol to Debbie Harry to Madonna to Tom Cruise.


  But what, exactly, is in it for Ray-Ban?


  The best brand collaborations take two strong names and products and combine them in a way that is unique, surprising, and frankly, awesome. Think Taco Bell and Doritos. _Stranger Things_ and Coke (or _Stranger Things_ plus Baskin Robbins or Levi's). Travis Scott and pretty much anything (see: McDonald's, Nike, _Fortnite_, Mattel).


  Even KFC and Crocs had a fun ring to it.


  Point is, each had something to offer the other, and both traded in the currency of brand image _quid pro quo_. Between Facebook and Ray-Ban right now? The brand lift is a one-way street.


  advertisement


  One is associated with James Dean, JFK, and as comfortable in a hipster wardrobe as it is on Joe Biden, and pretty much everywhere in between.


  Classic.


  Facebook? A Jekyll and Hyde of brand behavior. Is it the friendly platform where you see pics of your aunt's pandemic bread-baking progression or buy a dresser from a neighbor? Yep. Is it a cesspool of misinformation that threatens the health and safety of both actual people and democratic institutions? Uh-huh. Within a week of this new deal being announced, a former Facebook data scientist's 6,600-word memo--published by _BuzzFeed_--outlined the avalanche of fake accounts around the world that she had to try to shut down. It also mentioned the potential spread of COVID-19 misinformation to American users, linked to a ring of 672,000 accounts in Spain.

It will be young Shubman Gill's third IPL, and he would no double like to own the stage with his languid grace and effortless hitting, which he is so capable of. He can hit sixes over extra cover with grace and caress the ball through covers too.      These are exactly the traits that made Rohit Sharma, the great white ball exponent  that he is. Seasoned Rohit versus young Shubman is one for the keeps and makes this battle enticing.      But it's not just grace which makes T20 so appealing. The brute masculinity of power that sends the ball soaring into the orbit is what makes it so special.

Investors, for example, expect Musk to explain how Tesla will capitalize on its 2019 acquisition of U.S. battery company Maxwell Technologies Inc. Some investors expect the automaker to announce that Maxwell's dry battery electrode technology could significantly reduce manufacturing costs, speed up production and improve batteries' energy storage capacity.


  Musk has complained in the past that Tesla vehicles are not affordable enough. Tesla's lowest-range Model 3 sedan with a range of 250 miles (400 km) currently starts at US$37,990 in the United States. Musk in July said scaling battery cell production at an affordable price was Tesla's biggest limitation to growth.


  Tesla's futuristic Cybertruck, expected to be released in 2021, will have a maximum range of 500 miles, among the longest range of any electric vehicle on the market today.


  While average electric vehicle prices have decreased in recent years thanks to changes in battery chemistry and composition, they are still more expensive than conventional cars, with the battery estimated to make up a quarter to a third of an electric vehicle's cost.


  Some researchers estimate that price parity, or the point at which electric vehicles are equal in value to internal combustion cars, is reached when battery packs cost US$100 per kilowatt hour (kWh).


  Tesla's battery packs cost US$156 per kWh in 2019, according to electric vehicle consulting firm Cairn Energy Research Advisors, which would put the cost of a 90-kWh pack at around US$14,000.


  Analysts at UBS expect Tesla to announce battery cell costs of US$70 to US$80 per kWh over the next three years, allowing the company to save roughly US$2,300 per vehicle.


  Such a price advantage would leave competitors unlikely to catch up to Tesla, the UBS analysts said.


  Tesla currently produces batteries in partnership with Japan's Panasonic Corp at its US$5 billion Nevada factory, while South Korea's LG Chem and China's CATL supply cells to its Shanghai factory.


  Musk on Monday said Tesla intends to increase battery cell purchases from those three suppliers and possibly with other partners as well.


  Tesla is also building its own cell manufacturing facility at its new factory in Germany and is setting up a battery research and manufacturing facility at its largest vehicle factory in Fremont, California.


  Musk in July also said Tesla was open to license and supply powertrains and batteries to other automakers.

The Great Plains are the semiarid places east of the Rocky Mountains and west of the Mississippi River. The wind blows fast over these lands, sometimes scarily so. Over centuries, probably millennia, nature's solution was to grow grass that held the loose topsoil in place. But by the late 19th century, as the pioneers headed west, lured by promises of fertile farmland, they tilled the prairies, turning the grassy plains into wheat fields. The farmers felled trees that served as windbreaks, and turned the soil over and over, until there was no grass and the topsoil had been reduced to a thin, loose layer just covering the hard land beneath.

Voters can check their information at govotecolorado.gov or by calling the Chaffee County election office at 719-530-5604 or email elections@chaffeecounty.org.


  Lori Mitchell, Chaffee County Clerk, said voter files will be sent Sept. 28 and ballots will be mailed out the week of Oct. 12 for the Nov. 3 general election.


  Mitchell said due to the number of candidates for president and the number of ballot measures the ballot will be very long this year.


  There are 21 candidates for president and 11 state ballot measures on the 2020 Colorado ballot.


  Salida does not have any additional local measures, but Buena Vista voters will have two additional town measures to vote on concerning retail marijuana.


  On the ballot are U.S. Senator, U.S. Representative to the 117th Congress for Colorado District 5, State Representative for District 60, District Attorney for the 11th Judicial District, county commissioners for districts 1 and 2, and Colorado supreme court justice and court of appeals judge retentions.


  A blue book on state issues will be sent out as well as one on local issues for Buena Vista voters.


  Completed ballots can be dropped off at drop boxes or polling places or mailed in.


  Those who choose to mail should be aware that postmarks do not count and ballots must be received by Nov. 3. The suggested last date to mail is Oct. 26.


  Drop-boxes in Salida and Buena Vista will be open as of Oct. 12.


  The Salida 24-hour ballot box is located curbside at 104 Crestone Ave., and the Buena Vista 24-hour ballot box is located curbside at 112 Linderman Ave.


  Ballots can also be dropped off at voter service and polling centers in Salida, Buena Vista and Poncha Springs. Voting may be done in person at these locations as well.


  Voters can track their ballots at Ballottrax, a free service for voters that notifies them of when their mail ballot is sent, received, and counted.


  Voters can sign up at Colorado.BallotTrax.net to access the tool and can check the status of their mail ballot at any time.


  Mitchell said she hopes voters will cast their ballots as soon as possible after receiving them.


  Because of COVID-19 precautions, there are fewer election judges verifying signatures and counting votes due to social distancing requirements which means the counting process may take more time.


  She said it is to the benefit of voters as well as returning ballots will keep campaign calls from various groups to a minimum.


  As usual, however, Mitchell said she plans to begin posting results at 7 p.m. Nov. 3, but it will probably take longer than usual to have final results.

OSWEGO - Ebony Dixon has been appointed as SUNY Oswego’s first Executive Director of Enrollment Management, college President Deborah F. Stanley announced. Dixon joins the college officially on Sept. 14.


  As the college’s chief enrollment officer, Dixon will serve as a member of the President’s Council; oversee the Admissions operations of the college; and provide leadership to strategically plan, develop, coordinate, and implement SUNY Oswego’s comprehensive enrollment management and retention efforts.


  “Ebony has an outstanding record of leadership and effective collaboration in enrollment management at the collegiate level, and is passionately committed to the recruitment and retention of students,” Stanley said. “Her nearly two decades of experience as an admissions counselor, new student orientation assistant director, and senior enrollment officer have prepared her well, and position her to make immediate contributions as SUNY Oswego’s first Executive Director of Enrollment Management.”


  Dixon comes to SUNY Oswego from Southern Methodist University (SMU), where she most recently served as the Director of Recruitment and Retention for the Lyle School of Engineering. In that leadership position, she was responsible for developing and managing recruitment, marketing strategies and plans for all undergraduate and graduate programs.


  Prior to her time at SMU, Dixon was employed at her alma mater, Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan, for 15 years. Initially hired as an admissions counselor, she advanced to senior manager in the Enrollment Service Center and eventually assumed a leadership role as Associate Director of Enrollment Management for Wayne State’s School of Medicine.

Mullen expressed mixed feelings on facial recognition. “It’s a great idea, but there’s a slippery slope there,” Mullen said, emphasizing the need for total accuracy. “Once that technology becomes very clear and affordable, maybe we would use it. But I’m not out here to take away people’s constitutional rights,” he said.

This year has been brutal for the oil industry as demand cratered because of COVID-19. That caused oil prices to plummet, unleashing a shockwave that forced several oil companies to file for bankruptcy. Unfortunately, market conditions aren't improving as fast as industry forecasters had hoped, suggesting the sector is in for a tough slog. Because of that, more companies will likely go bankrupt. Those that survive will need to consider merging with a rival in hopes that their increased scale will enable them to better weather the storm that seems ahead for the sector.

Geico first came on board with the team in 2008, sponsoring Mike Wallace in a full season Xfinity Series effort. The insurance firm then moved its sponsorship to the Truck Series in 2009, as well as the team’s partial Cup effort with Papis. It was a hefty investment as Germain’s growth came in the middle of the economic recession.

The commission's next step is now to launch an impact assessment to analyse the issues identified during the evaluation, with a view to having revised rules in place by May 31, 2022. Stakeholders will have the possibility to comment on this impact as- sessment and to provide their views in the context of a public consultation, which is planned for the end of this year. Next year, the commission will then publish a draft of the revised rules for stakeholder views. Block exemptions such as the VBER together with the relevant guidance serve business well in so far as legal certainty is concerned.

According to CBS New York, which cited the complaint, Angwang has received nearly $120,000 by wire transfer from the Chinese government since 2016.


  Meanwhile, during fiscal year 2019, the city of New York paid Angwang a salary of about $53,500, according to online records viewed by the Post.


  Business Insider was unable to contact the Consulate General of the People's Republic of China in New York outside its working hours on Tuesday.


  In a Tuesday statement to Reuters, the consulate did not comment directly on Angwang's case but said its staff had been "fulfilling duties in accordance with international law and the law of the United States," and called their work "above board and beyond reproach."

Cincinnati right-hander Sonny Gray is expected to come off the injured list and start the second game of the Reds' series against Milwaukee. Gray (5-3, 3.94 ERA) hasn’t appeared in a game since Sept. 10 because of a strained back. He returns to a team that has won eight of nine to climb into playoff contention. Brewers left-hander Brett Anderson (3-3, 4.38 ERA) makes his second start since he was scratched because of hip tightness.

Cascades, in which small sparks cause great conflagrations, are happening all around us. Think of COVID-19, which began with a viral speck that was likely lodged in a bat somewhere in China--and is now a raging global pandemic. While viruses have been around forever, they mostly originate in animals and, when they jumped to humans, remained largely local. But over the past few decades, many viruses have gone global, causing widespread epidemics--SARS, MERS, Ebola, Zika and now the novel coronavirus. In a recent essay in the scientific journal _Cell,_ the country's top infectious--disease expert, Anthony Fauci, and one of his colleagues, David Morens, warn that we "have reached a tipping point that forecasts the inevitability of an acceleration of disease emergencies." In other words, get ready for more pandemics. The fundamental reason behind this acceleration, they argue, is human action--the ever increasing scope and pace of development.

Article 101(1) of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) prohibits agreements between undertakings that restrict competition. This means that vertical agreements are, as a rule, prohibited in terms of this treaty's article. However, in terms of Article 101(3) TFEU, agreements can be exempted provided that they contribute to improving the production or distribution of goods or to promoting technical or economic progress, while allowing consumers a fair share of the resulting benefits without eliminating competition.

Coney Barrett emerged as the clear preference of a growing number of senators, largely because she is the much better-known of the two, having been through a grueling Senate confirmation process already and been embraced by the conservative base. Predictability is considered a crucial factor for the president and vulnerable senators so close to the election. Lagoa remains in the running, however, and those who know her well expect Trump to warm to her if and when they meet in person.

have followed suit. E-commerce will likely be the beneficiary of these decisions. Katz agrees, “As many retailers decide to shut their doors on Thanksgiving Day and customers steer clear of in-store shopping more so than in previous years, there will be a shift towards e-commerce — particularly by means of mobile devices as shoppers sit inside with family and friends.”

In this article I argue that re-opening of schools and other learning institutions is a double-edged sword, if you like. On one hand we needed the learning institutions to reopen to ameliorate the impacts of prolonged closures on the social, psychological, and learning needs of the learners, especially adolescents. In this era of social media, your guess is as good as mine on how our children were utilising their idle time. On the other hand, the health and safety concerns of learners, arising from hasty and unplanned re-opening, cannot be over-emphasised or downplayed. I lay my case by calibrating the article on the subject I published three weeks titled, _Covid 19: Without Strategy Schools could remain shut indefinitely._
