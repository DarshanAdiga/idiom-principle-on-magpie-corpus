Important Caveat: The figures should be seen as market estimates, as opposed to historical records, as these are forecasted for the current year of trade. More importantly, in light of the fact that unforeseeable factors might interrupt markets in achieving their reported levels, the figures should be seen as estimates of potential. For example, “mad cow” disease, foot-and-mouth disease, trade embargoes, labor disputes, military conflicts, acts of terrorism, and other events will certainly affect the actual trade flows recorded for a variety of industry or product categories. In such cases, the difference between the numbers given in this report and the numbers actually observed might be interpreted as the “net loss” or “net gain” due to these exogenous events affecting regular trade flows that would have occurred had these events not have taken place.

The Jet J-2530 15-Inch Benchtop Drill Press is a no-frills, heavy-duty machine that is made to work long and hard to drill as many holes as you need. The entire drill press is made of solid cast iron and, boy, does it look like it. It weighs around 150 pounds so get a buddy to help you install this beast.


  For starters, this drill press has a 3/4 HP motor that's more than a match for any material you throw at it. Speed can be changed via belts at the top of the head; the process is quick and easy with a lot fewer headaches than you might think. Simply release the tension, change the belt according to the diagram, and re-tension. That's it.


  The swing is 15 inches so you can work on extremely large pieces of material with bits up to 5/8″ in size. That 15-inch working capacity is the largest I've seen on any benchtop drill press. The oversized 15-inch square worktable can be moved up and down easily and rotated 45-degrees from side to side.


  No, it doesn't have storage for the key and it doesn't have a fancy laser sight to show you where the bit will go. What it lacks in bells and whistles is more than enough heft and solid durability to last for years if not decades. The Jet J-2530 is an incredibly strong consumer-grade monster of a benchtop drill press that will most likely outlast _you_.

If you're a parent that prefers an overabundance of caution in raising your child, then this review of the AmazonBasics 4-Piece Wood Chisel Set won't be for you. Not to worry, there are plenty of safer tools on our list of Best Tools for Kids. We'll wait to proceed until you move on. No worries.


  Okay, those of you still with me are in for a treat. This set of four well- honed wood chisels is surprisingly good, especially for a beginning woodworker. If you've ever dreamed of crafting a pine derby car with your kid, this might help punch your ticket to the races. Not everyone has access to a bandsaw so wood chisels are really handy for teaching your kid the value of patient craftsmanship as well as how to handle a sharp object safely and confidently.


  Not enough kids get hands-on training with tools growing up, especially sharp ones, so the idea of spending time teaching your little one about how to handle tools like a wood chisel is incredibly unique. As always, use caution around tools and never (ever) let your kid out of your sight with something like a wood chisel. The time you spend now teaching such values as responsibility will pay off enormously in the long run.

This is THE toolbox for the generations. It's big, it's heavy and it's beautiful. The Kennedy Manufacturing K24B 24″ All-Purpose Tool Box is the best box you can get for your tools and will exceed your expectations. This isn't some plastic hybrid trying to make compromises, no sir. Kennedy Manufacturing has been making industrial-grade equipment in Ohio since 1911 and they know a thing or two about what folks need out of a central piece of hardware like this.


  The K24B has a stronger load capacity and spacious tool storage (24 inches long) with a vinyl-cushioned, steel core top handle. The box itself is made of 20 gauge steel. The plated locking hardware is stout, to say the least. No one is going to spill any tools out of this box. The steel tote tray features a socket set divider to keep things tidy. All the pieces are coated with a hammered-finish brown enamel that will have friends and co-workers asking where you picked up such a high-quality toolbox.


  Kennedy Manufacturing also makes a seven-drawer machinist's chest to match and it's just as awesome as the K24B toolbox. Do yourself a favor and pick both of these up already. You'll be glad you did.

The WEN 4225 Variable Speed 15-Inch Floor Drill Press features a strong 8.6 Amp electric motor with the ability to change the speed of your drill chuck from 280 to 1,000 RPM on the fly. Speeds from 1,000 to 3,300 RPM can be changed with quick belt adjustments. There is an LED tachometer that brilliantly displays the current running speed.


  This floor drill press is a full four inches of depth capacity; if you're looking to drill clean through a 4×4 fence post, this floor drill press will allow you to do it. The 12-inch by 12-inch cast iron table pivots up to 45 degrees in either direction to accommodate angled perforations. The chuck features a Morse #2 spindle taper and will accept drill bits 1/12-inches to 5/8-inches in diameter.


  There is an onboard laser accuracy guide however it takes a little work to dial this in to use effectively. There is also a work lamp included for illuminating the worktable. The base, table, column and head are all constructed of cast iron which is not only tough and sturdy but also limits vibration during use. The WEN 4225 Variable Speed 15-Inch Floor Drill Press is an excellent addition to any workshop and allows the user to get some serious production done.

If there's one thing I remember about my grandfather, it's that he always, without fail, carried a pocket knife. Need to cut some string? Out came the knife. Need to open a letter? Whoosh! There goes the blade. There's something strong and reassuring about a trusty pocket knife. I think he would have appreciated (and admired) the Stockman 3-Blade Pocket Knife from Buck Knives.


  According to Buck Knives, the Stockman features a 2-3/4″ clip point blade used for detail work and cutting in tight places, a 2″ spey blade good for skinning and sweeping knife strokes, and a 2″ sheepsfoot blade suitable for making clean cuts, especially on a flat surface. I must stop here and tell you that I had no idea that different pocket knife blades had names nor was I aware they were meant for specific tasks. That's cool.


  The 420J2 stainless steel that Buck Knives uses is known for its corrosion resistance and special tempering process making them more durable and sharper than other knives. The beautiful woodgrain handle with nickel silver bolsters make this knife look incredibly sharp (sorry). At a little less than 4 inches in length, the Stockman is the largest of Buck's multi-blade folding knives. Buck Knives has so much pride in their products that they offer a lifetime warranty, something you really don't see much of these days.


  Starting a new tradition with my kids and (someday) grandkids sounds like a great idea these days; the Buck Knives Sportsman 3-Blade Pocket Knife is a great way to do it.

You're going to look at the Mixing Mate Paint Can Lid and think, "There's no way this gadget is going to work." You can think that all you want however I'm here to tell you that this gadget not only does work, it's unbelievably great. Say goodbye to your paint lid openers and stirring sticks because this tool will revolutionize your painting chores. The Mixing Mate Paint Can Lid features a pistol grip handle that allows you to pour the paint out like a maple syrup bottle. A thumb trigger on the handle opens an air hole to supply a smooth flow then seals tight after each pour. The lid features tool-free cam clamps that securely anchor the lid to any standard gallon size paint can; just twist to lock and you're in business. A gasket on the lid effectively seals the can so your paint stays fresh. When you're ready to use again, turn the handle on top to twist the auger in the can to stir up the paint. This even works on old paint that has completely settled out. When you're done and ready to clean it, simply take it apart and wash with water or solvents. The Mixing Mate Paint Can Lid also comes in a quart-size version, too. If you paint anything (even incidentally), this tool will make your job much, much easier.

In a bid to drive growth in the long run, Extended Stay is banking on numerous strategic efforts. Notably, the company is refocusing on core customers. Also, its initiatives toward controlling costs and reducing capital requirement for fresh hotel builds are commendable. Under its ESA 2.0 strategy, the company aims to franchise its brands and drive growth through various strategies. It also plans on enhancing its digital capabilities that would eventually boost revenues and earnings.      Moreover, the company is banking on increasing unit growth to drive RevPAR. As of Sep 30, 2020, the company had a pipeline of 65 hotels. Nevertheless, after completing its pipeline on balance sheet development, the company anticipates further unit growth. It also expects several franchise conversions during the fourth quarter of 2020.      Meanwhile, the company continues to focus on its four-pillar strategy to unlock and create shareholder value in the coming years. The first pillar is to maximize core operations and drive more extended stay demand at the company's properties. The second pillar is to pursue accretive asset sales for certain assets that can yield a higher value through alternative uses. The third pillar is furthering on the company's asset light strategy, with focus on franchise growth. The last pillar is return of capital to shareholders.      With the pandemic and business conditions improving, the company continues to review future distributions in order to maintain its REIT status. Nonetheless, the company expects to boost shareholders’ revenues and offer cash distributions to the range of 15 to 20 cents per share by early 2021.      So far this year, shares of the company have fallen 5.5% compared with the industry’s 8% fall.

This set of countersink drill bits from Snappy Tools might seem a little steep at $25 but that old adage about getting what you paid for definitely applies here. I hate cheap tools that break after not performing well. Be good to yourself (and, in the long run, your wallet) and get this Snappy Tools Quick-Change Countersink Drill Bit Set.


  Here's why: They're big and tough. You can feel the heft when you pick them up. The bits are actually sharp and they fit into countersink sleeves very well. All too often the sleeves are too small, taking the drill bit out of alignment and ultimately breaking it. The quality machining is clearly evident with this set. The set screw system is easy to loosen and tighten back up so the bits stay where you want them. The set screws are substantial in size and are difficult to strip with an Allen wrench. Each countersink sleeve fits in a standard hexagonal receptacle; not having to adjust the chuck when changing bits is pretty awesome.


  On top of that, they're made right here in the good ol' USA. How about that? Where this Snappy Tools Countersink Drill Bit Set is concerned, quality really _is_ the best value.

No matter if you have just begun a woodworking hobby or you are a master furniture builder, you owe it to yourself to extend past the boundaries of traditional Western-style tools and experience what the Suizan Ryoba Japanese Pull Saw may contribute to your projects.


  Easy to identify because of its two edges (one set of teeth for ripping and one set for crosscutting), the ryoba cuts on the pull stroke and is a good starter saw for general carpentry. When first using a ryoba saw, it might be difficult to make a straight cut with such a flexible blade however making your cut in stages will surprise you with the accuracy you can achieve. Japanese pull saws are lighter in weight, require less power, and finish with a cleaner edge than standard European saws.


  Made of high-quality Japanese steel, the ryoba is the standard work saw of Japanese culture fabricated by true craftsmen. It is sharp, rugged, and precise. There is something serene and satisfying by using this ancient woodworking tool to create something beautifully complex. Allow the saw to do the work and may experience a soothing new way of woodworking that will align your chi.

Want to get into making your own pickled asparagus, onions, kimchi, and..er…pickles? You can't get any simpler than the Easy Fermenter Kit by Nourished Essentials. This has everything you need to get going right now: three wide mouth mason jar lids, three easy weights to keep the food down in the brine, an oxygen vacuum pump, and a recipe book full of things to try. You even get a lifetime membership to a fermentation club to ask other folks about their tips and tricks.


  You'll have to pick up your own mason jars but that's okay since the lids are compatible with just about any wide mouth jar there is out there. Each Easy Fermenter lid has a waterless airlock valve that lets carbon dioxide out, but stops evil stuff like oxygen, mold, and bacteria from getting in. The lids have a thicker gasket than other brands to prevent air leaks and are made of high-quality, dense plastic. Easy to remove when you need to and they will last for many pickling sessions.


  The included three weights that keep your veggies down have handles to grip them in the middle or on the sides. That means you can quickly remove and replace the weight when you're testing things out. You'll always get a strong grip, so you'll never have to worry about spills or contaminating the brine with your fingers.


  What are you waiting for? It's never been a better time to start pickling!

The Craftsman Autohammer is one of those tools that you may think you don't need but when the occasion calls for it, you'll be very glad this piece of tech is in your box. I was working between some floor joists one time and had to use a hammer and nail to secure a pipe clamp. The space was limited and cramped so swinging my claw hammer was tough, to say the least. Between my sore knuckles and several bent nails, I was ready to call it a day after just _one_ driven nail. This little power tool would have come in extremely handy that day.


  The Craftsman Autohammer provides hammer access at right angles, awkward angles, and straight above your head angles. This powerhouse drives nails quickly into finished wood and construction lumber. It's good with common and finishing nails up to 16d at 3,600 impacts per minute. Just set the nail in place into the strong magnetic sleeve, squeeze the trigger, and go to town. The electric brake quickly stops hammering when you release the trigger.


  Cool-looking venting keeps it…uh…cool and the over-mold grip looks and feels great. A large LED lights up your work area directly and rotates with the head. There's also a gauge that shines green, yellow, or red to indicate the amount of charge remaining. The Craftsman Autohammer comes packaged with one 12V battery and quick Nextec Quickboost charger that provides a 25% charge in just three minutes! Yikes. Yes, you could use a cordless driver and screws but this is an _automatic hammer_. That's just plain awesome.

  The keyed chuck can handle up to 1/2″ drill bits and can accommodate accurate, repeatable holes in your material. The WEN 4208 is the perfect size for your shop and portable enough to take with you to a job site. The entire thing is constructed of cast iron including head, table, and base to ensure consistent results.


  The induction motor features ball bearings for extended life and it all comes together with smooth and balanced performance even at high speeds. The 6-1/2-inch square worktable bevels 45-degrees left and right for reasonably precise right angles. The base contains predrilled holes for mounting onto your workbench.


  Is the WEN 4208 Benchtop Drill Press a commercial-grade unit that will take an overabundance of abuse? No. Is it a little rough around the edges? Yep. But here's the thing: it's a solid-performing drill press that is a great size for a shop. And it's super-cheap. Buy it already.

_Speed_ is important to look at, too. You won’t need much speed to drive through steel but when it comes to softwoods like pine, it’s good to have a quick RPM so the wood doesn’t tear apart. It also saves time. A good rule of thumb is that the harder the substance is that you’re drilling through, the lower amount of speed you’ll want to do it. The average drill press will be capable of turning the bit from 300 to 3,000 RPM.

Craftsman's cordless power tools don't get as much notice as the DeWalts or Milwaukees of the world, but they're definitely worthy of your workbench. Their oscillating tool is part of the V20 line of tools and it has some really good features you should look at. And when I say look, I mean it. This tool is beautiful but it's not just for looks.


  First off, the overmolded rubber handle looks like it came from the Batcave. It's contoured and comfortable to make for a solid grip. The LED work light is mounted immediately at the front of the tool head for maximum visibility. And the included V20 battery was designed so that when it's slapped into the handle, the tool can stand up straight on the base when set down.


  Changing out the attachments is an incredibly easy proposition; just hold down the chunky release lever, swap the first blade with another one, and release the lever. This multi-tool can work with other blades from other manufacturers as well. Speed is controlled with the variable dial on the lower handle. That's unfortunate that it wasn't built into the trigger but a case could be made for solid speed settings without having to worry about how much you mash down the trigger.


  The kit includes the CMCE500 oscillating tool, 20V MAX 2.0Ah lithium-ion battery and charger, a sanding attachment, two pieces of 240-grit sandpaper, three pieces of 100-grit sandpaper, a wood blade, two pieces of 80-grit sandpaper, a bi-metal blade, and a scraper blade. The 2.0Ah battery isn't going to last for hours but I like that at least it's included with the kit.

Even though power planers and jointers make short work out of smoothing boards, there is still a place in any woodshop for a handy block plane. Peeling paper-thin savings from wood and leaving a high-quality surface is why you should own a block plane. They're versatile, convenient, and natural.


  This plane can erase machine-milling marks on your lumber that's difficult to do with power tools. It can also square up small pieces you're working on that are too dangerous to run over a jointer. Beveling edges is made easy with a block plane. You can cut slightly outside a line then shave down to it with a block plane for a nicer surface and truer edge.


  Fitting doors and other parts is made easy with a block plane as well, especially a jack plane which is a long version of a block plane designed to shape wood with long surfaces.

This plane is perfectly flat across the bottom and sides, true and square. The plane blade is sharp right out of the box and extremely easy to dial in to use. The handles are made of solid wood and finished very well.  You may find better hand planes out there however they will also cost you twice as much or more.

But then I found the Bora Portamate Speedhorse and my mind was blown. These things are ready to go right out of the box. The sawhorses are designed to be set up and taken down quickly and feature a handle for easy transport. When you get them to where you're going, simply pull the small trigger next to the handle and the legs drop down in less than two seconds.


  These sawhorses are definitely heavy-duty, made of steel and can support up to 1,500 pounds, much more than any other sawhorse out there. The top rails feature a cavity on both sides to insert a two-by board for more rigid support. The tops of the horses are pre-drilled for attaching a 2×4 if needed. When you're ready to go, release either leg (it doesn't matter which one) and fold it up. The Bora Portamate Speedhorse is really impressive and is the most must-have item of must-have items for your space. Highly recommended!

  The work table features a decent rack and pinion method of adjusting the height and the it tilts 45 degrees for angled hole drilling. A storage compartment to hold the chuck key is a really nice addition. There's also an integrated work light to illuminate your workspace.


  The Ryobi DP103L is a great hobby press for your workshop. If you're looking for a precision drill press that will get you tolerances of thousands of an inch, there are other machines out there for you. However if you're like the millions of weekend do-it-yourselfers that are looking for a simple benchtop drill press to get some holes bored out, this is a nice option.

_Speed_ is important to look at, too. You won’t need much speed to drive through steel but when it comes to softwoods like pine, it’s good to have a quick RPM so the wood doesn’t tear apart. It also saves time. A good rule of thumb is that the harder the substance is that you’re drilling through, the lower amount of speed you’ll want to do it. The average drill press will be capable of turning the bit from 200 to 3,600 RPM.

Disclaimer: I own a Ryobi gas-powered string trimmer and I love it. It's powerful, easy to use, and I swap the trimmer head with the edger head on a regular basis when maintaining my yard. Other than putting up with a gas tank that's awkward to fill, I love the thing. This model, the Ryobi 40 Volt Attachment Capable Cordless String Trimmer is as good or better than the gas- powered model with none of the hassle of spilling gas all over the place (I'm embarrassed to say that it's happened more often than I care to mention).


  Part of the 40 Volt family of cordless electric products from Ryobi, this trimmer comes with a 4Ah battery (and charger) good enough to mow down an acre's worth of perimeter on one charge.  I don't have nearly that much to take care of so the battery packs more than enough juice for me to edge the grass and trim in one go. Keep in mind that your first couple of sessions will last shorter until you break in your battery. It will take 90 minutes on average to fully charge the battery. I'm also a stickler for having a spare battery ready to go in the charger just in case; I hate waiting for batteries to charge.


  The "Reel-Easy" bump-feed string head is actually easy to fill with cutting line and a satisfying step above older heads. The Ryobi 40 Volt Attachment Capable Cordless String Trimmer is compatible with their entire family to attachments including a pole saw, leaf blower, lawn edger, and hedge trimmer among others. It's also compatible with other universal attachments made by other manufacturers. I've had great luck with Ryobi models (and I'm a bit of an organizational freak when it comes to tools), so I stick with them.


  All in all, this Ryobi cordless string trimmer will have you shaping up your yard in nothing flat so you can enjoy the rest of your weekend. Highly recommended.

There's another way, too. And while it may be a shot in the dark, it's not unprecedented and should not be asking too much. If Boston could have one young player between Romeo Langford, Aaron Nesmith or Payton Pritchard rise to the occasion and make an impact in their first or second year, it could really make for a crucial depth piece. Langford showed glimpses during his rookie season while first-rounders Nesmith and Pritchard were drafted largely because of their ability to shoot. It's time for Ainge's middle-of-the-road draft picks to start paying off.

STOCKHOLM (AP) - A woman in her 70s is no longer suspected of having kept her son locked up in an apartment south of Stockholm for as long as 28 years, a Swedish prosecutor said Thursday.
 Prosecutor Emma Olsson, who headed the preliminary investigation, told Swedish media that investigators found no evidence that the woman's son, who is in his 40s, had been kept in the apartment against his will.
 The mother had been held on suspicion of unlawful deprivation of liberty and grievous bodily harm.
 "We have not been able to find any evidence that any crime has been committed by the woman," Olsson told broadcaster SVT.
 Swedish daily newspaper Expressen reported this week that the man was found Sunday by a relative who had learned that his mother had been admitted to a hospital. The relative went to the flat, found the door unlocked and entered.
 The relative told the newspaper there was "urine, dirt and dust" all over the place and the apartment "smelled rotten." She heard a noise from the kitchen and found the man sitting on blankets and pillows.
 According to the relative´s account, he had no teeth, had sores on his legs and his speech was slurred. She alerted authorities afterwards.
 Swedish news agency TT wrote that the relative was the man's sister and Olsson said the wounds came from illnesses, not from violence.
 The investigation has not yet been formally closed, but the mother is no longer suspected of any crime and has been released.

You can never have too many clamps. They're great for a myriad of tasks and these one-handed bar clamps from Irwin are simply too good not to have in your workshop. This set of four is perfect to get your kid started down the road of responsible, effective woodworking.


  They feature pads that won't harm the surfaces your kid is working on. The quick-grip design allows anyone to squeeze the trigger, tighten up the seal, and release without worrying that they'll slide off. And with one hand, no less! 140 pounds of force is more than enough to glue up that planter box and hold the sides together.


  Simply put, these are the simplest and most effective clamps ever designed. Your kids will love using them on projects with you and, when they've grown up and off on their adventures, they might leave one or two behind for you to use! Highly recommended.

The Landworks 7HP 212cc Gas-Powered Mini Wood Chipper features the ability to chip and shred branches, limb, and yard debris up to three inches in diameter. The reduction ratio is 15:1 with an elongated top adjustable discharge chute. Not bad for this small of a unit.


  This wood chipper is powered by a 7HP 212cc 4-stroke single cylinder gas- powered engine. Keep in mind that ethanol is not recommended for this machine. The engine is about as basic a gas setup as there is with a manual choke, throttle, power switch, gas shut-off, etc. You'll need to fill the oil reservoir yourself as it's not shipped with any oil.


  This wood chipper is a solid performer. The feed bin and discharge chute are all metal with a thick coat of paint. Blades are supremely sharp and will whittle down anything you throw at it up to a three-inch diameter. Leaves and brush aren't mulched as effectively as dry, seasoned sticks and branches. The motor also has a problem stalling if branches are simply thrown in the feed bin; this is resolved when they are gently fed.


  The Landworks Mini Wood Chipper features a handle and 10-inch hard plastic wheels for portability. A tow bar kit is available (sold separately) so you can hook it up to an ATV or small lawn mower or tractor and take the wood chipper where you need it.


  This wood chipper comes with a three-year limited warranty and Landworks features a no-hassle customer service department. The Landworks 7HP 212cc Gas- Powered Mini Wood Chipper is a great little shredder to use around your yard and acreage.

Sugru Moldable Glue is a multi-purpose, multi-surface moldable glue. It bonds permanently to almost _anything_ including ceramics, metal, glass, wood, plaster, stone, brick, rubber, most plastics and fabrics, and even flexible materials. Sugru is even resistant to water and high temperatures. It does all that yet the chemical composition is mild enough even for the hands of children (kids younger than three still shouldn't play with it).


  Once out of the package, Sugru feels soft and pliable like modeling clay. Mold it by hand into any shape you want then apply where you need it. Watch out, though: You only have 45 minutes to form it, smooth it, and put it where you want it. It hardens to a tough, shock-resistant silicone rubber within 24 hours although thicker layers may take a little longer.


  There are a million uses for this stuff like arts and crafts, re-attach, replace or rebuild broken parts, patches for shoes and clothes, create custom grips for equipment and tools, mount household fixtures without drilling, use as a sealant or to patch cracks, fix and reinforce cords and cables like mobile phone chargers (up to 24 volts).


  Sugru even offers kits that walk users through various applications like this Hacks for Home Use set. Fun!

What's the number two item in anyone's toolbox? Well, that would have to be a hammer of course. This Ball Peen Hammer by Tekton features a fiberglass handle to absorb vibrations and an exterior poly jacket to protect the core from when…er…you miss what you're trying to hit. Hey, it happens.


  Ball peen hammers are good first hammers for a few reasons. First, the absence of a claw on the back of the head means fewer chances to hurt yourself. Second, it's lighter than a claw hammer so it's easier to swing. This version is an 8oz hammer; heavy enough to drive some brads or light nails and easy for your kids to use. Larger sizes available at the link if you're up for it.


  It's got a soft and comfortable non-slip grip for a nice feel when you're swinging at some nails. The head is made of forged steel and it's fused to the handle with an epoxy bond which should last for an incredibly long time.
