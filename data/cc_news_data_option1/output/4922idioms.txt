No ambitious conservative can afford to oppose Trump’s positions, even when they tip over into magical thinking. Most have avoided recognising Biden as the president-elect, an omission that would have been unthinkable under previous Republican presidents.
 In such a climate, attempting to unify the party, let alone the country, will be a heavy lift. The most a conventional politician can hope to do is communicate multiple messages, in a half-chuckled way that allows disparate constituencies to hear whatever they want to.
 In an interview on Fox, hours after the news conference, Pompeo repeated his points about vote-counting and the US constitution. When the host asked if he was serious about his transition remark, he avoided answering.
 Trump himself took notice of Pompeo’s stubborn commitment to living within the ever-changing borders of his boss’s fantasies, retweeting the “second Trump administration” clip with approval that night.
 The following week, Trump invited Michigan lawmakers to the White House in the clear hope of finding a way to deprive Biden, who won the state, of its 16 electoral votes.

Parts of Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Puducherry, and south coastal Andhra Pradesh will start receiving heavy rainfall under the influence of a deep depression in the Bay of Bengal. The low pressure system is likely to intensify into cyclone with wind speeds of up to 80km per hour by Tuesday evening and will be named Burevi. The system is currently located 930km southeast of Kanyakumari. As per the current trajectory, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast that the cyclone will continue to move northwestwards and cross the Sri Lankan coast near Trincomalee in the evening or night of December 2. It is likely to continue its westward movement to reach the Indian coast the next morning. The cyclone comes on the tail of the severe cyclonic storm Nivar that had made landfall in Karaikal, Puducherry, on November 25. It was the third named cyclone to hit the Indian coast in 2020 -- the first was super cyclonic storm Amphan in May and severe cyclonic storm Nisarga in June. There would be squally winds reaching the speed of up to 65 km per hour on Tamil Nadu and Kerala coast on December 2 as the system nears India. As per the IMD forecast, it is likely to bring extremely heavy rainfall to parts of south Tamil Nadu and south Kerala on December 3 when it is likely to reach the Indian coast. The sea conditions will be rough to very rough Monday through December 4, with the government advising a complete suspension of fishing operations in the region. The fishermen have been advised to return to coast by Monday.

The Australian cricket fraternity has been debating about Warner's opening partner in the Test series with a few backing the struggling Joe Burns to keep his place while others want the young William Pucovski to open.      However, the injury to Warner has changed the scenario and has created a situation where both Burns and Pucovski could open.      Langer said, it has taken "a bit of pressure off".      "No wonder I'm a bit more relaxed. We've won a few games and I don't have to worry about who we're going to pick for the Test side," Langer was quoted as saying by the Australian media after the team arrived in Canberra for the third ODI.      Australia 'A' will lock horns with India 'A' in a one-day practice game from December 6 and against the senior Indian team on December 11 in Sydney in a three-day warm-up game before the Test series.      "I've said it so many times, the hardest part of the job is selecting the teams, but we've got an Australia 'A' game starting in a few days and it'll be a good opportunity for those guys against the Indian 'A' side to put their hand up.      "And then after that is another Australia 'A' game versus the actual Indian Test side at the SCG under lights with a pink ball," Langer said.      "We'll work out who's going to play in that game and certainly there's huge opportunities for people to put their hand up."      The four-match Test series will begin in Adelaide with the day-night pink ball Test from December 17.      If Pucovski is picked as Burns' opening partner, he would make his Test debut in a day-night game like Matthew Renshaw, Peter Handscomb and Nic Maddinson did in 2016 against South Africa.      Talking about the enormous pain that Warner suffered after getting injured during the second ODI in Sydney, Langer said it was like receiving a gun shot.      "He's strained his abductor in his groins and they tell me it's a very painful injury. It looked like he got shot by a gun. He was in incredible pain in the changerooms after," he said.      "I'm not holding my breath that he'll be ready for the first Test match, but with that said he's the sort of elite professional who will be doing literally everything possible to be ready for it.      "We'll see what happens, but he's going to be a loss that's for sure."      D'Arcy Short has replaced Warner in Australia's T20 squad.      Reports suggest that the kind of injury Warner has suffered, it would require about four weeks to heal and Warner may miss the first two Tests of the series.

 Except most of us don’t want to. We just want to get on with our lives to the greatest extent that we can. We want to stay safe and to keep everyone else safe. But we also want to see our kids and grandkids, especially at Christmas – provided, and only provided, that Government measures reassure us that it’s safe to do so. And by and large, that’s what Nphet and the Government have arrived at.
 A few differences in nuance here and there, to be sure, and probably a bit more foreboding in Nphet’s message than in the Government announcement. But I think we all get it.

India’s manufacturing sector activity lost momentum and fell to a three-month low in November amid slower increases in factory orders, exports and buying levels, a monthly survey said on Tuesday.
 The seasonally adjusted IHS Markit India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) fell from 58.9 in October to a three-month low of 56.3 in November, indicating that the manufacturing sector growth remained strong, despite losing traction.
 In PMI parlance, a print above 50 means expansion, while a score below that denotes contraction.
 “The Indian manufacturing sector remained on the right path to recovery, with strong growth of new orders and output sustained during November,” Pollyanna De Lima, Economics Associate Director at IHS Markit, said.
 Lima further noted that “the softening of rates of expansion seen in the latest month does not represent a major setback, since these are down from over decade highs in October, a spike in COVID-19 cases and the possibility of associated restrictions could undermine the recovery“.
 As per the survey, aggregate new orders rose at the slowest pace in three months.
 The companies indicated that sales growth was underpinned by resilient demand, though curbed by the COVID-19 pandemic, it added.
 “Companies noted that the pandemic was the key factor weighing on growth during November, with COVID-related uncertainty also restricting business confidence,” Lima said.
 Business optimism faded slightly in November. “Output growth is still predicted for the year ahead, but concerns about public policies, rupee depreciation and the COVID-19 pandemic dampened overall confidence,” according to the survey.
 Employment, on the other hand, decreased again as companies observed social distancing guidelines. The rate of job shedding was solid and little-changed from October.
 “Employment remained in contraction territory, however, with companies reportedly keeping the minimum possible number of workers as per government guidelines,” Lima said.
 On the price front, input costs and output charges rose at accelerated rates that nevertheless remained below their respective long-run averages.
 Meanwhile, India’s economy recovered faster than expected in the September quarter as a pick-up in manufacturing helped GDP clock a lower contraction of 7.5 per cent.
 The gross domestic product (GDP) had contracted by a record 23.9 per cent in the first quarter of 2020-21 fiscal (April 2020 to March 2021) as the coronavirus lockdown pummelled economic activity.
 The second straight quarter of contraction pushed India to its first technical recession. PTI DRR BAL 12011123

The latest annual destruction is a substantial increase from the 7,536 square kilometers that were deforested in 2018, the year before Bolsonaro took office.
 While environmentalists blamed the government for the rise, federal officials hailed the figures as a sign of progress in fighting deforestation, as the increase was far lower than the 34% increase recorded in 2019. “While we are not here to celebrate this, it does signify that the efforts we are making are beginning to bear fruit,” Vice President Hamilton Mourao told reporters at Inpe headquarters in the Sao Paulo satellite city of Sao Jose dos Campos.
 Bolsonaro has weakened the environmental enforcement agency Ibama and called for introducing more commercial farming and mining in the Amazon region, arguing it will lift the region out of poverty. Environmental advocates say this has emboldened illegal ranchers, miners and land grabbers to clear the forest.
 “The PRODES figures show that Bolsonaro's plan worked. They reflect the result of a successful initiative to annihilate the capacity of the Brazilian State and the inspection bodies to take care of our forests and fight crime in the Amazon,” the Brazilian non-governmental organization Climate Observatory said in a statement.
 The president's main policy response to global outcry over Amazon destruction has been to send in the military, who were first deployed in 2019 and are expected to remain in the region fighting deforestation and forest fires through April 2021.
 Mourao said the government is planning further measures to combat deforestation after the military operation ends in April, without giving details. He said the government must work within its currently tight budget constraints.
 More recently, deforestation declined in July to September compared with the same months a year ago, according to preliminary Inpe data, but was back on the rise in October.
 European leaders such as French President Emmanuel Macron have fiercely criticized Brazil, arguing it is not doing enough to protect the forest. The election of Joe Biden as U.S. president has raised the possibility that the United States will also ramp up pressure on Brazil over the rainforest.
 Biden said in a debate that the world should offer Brazil money to fund efforts to stop deforestation, and threatened economic consequences against the Latin American nation if it did not. The comment drew fierce criticism from Bolsonaro, who said it was a threat against Brazil's sovereignty.

Pontius Pilate had no choice but to order the death of Jesus in order to prevent another rebellion from occurring. Who forced his hand, the Jewish people. Pontius Pilate could care less about Jesus, some accounts seem to have him holding Jesus in a favourable light, but he would have more than likely been recalled to Rome had another rebellion took place under his watch. To stave off the riotous Jewish crowd, he gave them what they wanted and ordered the execution of Jesus. No such evidence has ever been put forth that Pilate viewed Jesus as a revolutionary.

In addition, slavery was not a uniquely black experience. I am sick and tired of this lie being perpetuated to the point where most individuals only know of the West African slave trade when hearing the term slavery. Romans enslaved Greeks, British enslaved Irish, Barbary pirates enslaved whoever they could capture, Arabs enslaved blacks, etc. Point is that slavery occurred on a much broader scale than the West African slave trade alone. To imply that the Bible has racial undertones in these Scriptures is just foolish and reeks of a political agenda. The writer of this article also fails to take into context that the idea of considering slavery as evil is very new relative to the known course of human history. The abolition movement only started to gain prominence in the 18th and 19th centuries (Brazil did not abolish slavery until 1888 – almost into the 20th century!), for thousands of years of recorded human history, slavery has been the norm. As a matter of fact, the early Church was revolutionary in the fact that they held abolitionist beliefs themselves. I suggest that the writer of this article read the book of Philemon. As it regards Onesimus, the slave that had been instructed to return to his master, Paul made every subtle attempt possible to encourage Philemon to manumit his slave. It was not Paul’s place to directly suggest this to Philemon, so he approached the question in a more subtle way. When it comes to the context of the quoted Scriptures, the principles behind them still apply to this day. Instead of slave/master, we can substitute employee/employer. Employees are to work diligently for their employers and do a good job, while employers are to treat their employees fairly and pay them their wages.
