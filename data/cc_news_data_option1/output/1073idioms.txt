This Amazon production, which premieres as a stream on March 20, is a nicely constructed, low-budget thriller that features many layers that its writing- directing partners Bridget Savage Cole and Danielle Krudy manage to keep on an even, slowly unfolding keel. Not surprisingly, it opens in song, on an ocean pier, with a fisherman, accompanied by three other fishermen, belting out the title song.      But why they're singing it, and why the film takes its name from it, is and will remain a bigger mystery than the multiple mysteries that move the film along.      The location is the fictional Easter Cove, Maine, where two women, Pris (Sophie Lowe) and her younger sister Mary Beth (Morgan Saylor) - they're known in town as the Connolly girls - are sharing a drink before attending the funeral of their mother.      Though this appears to be the beginnings of a character study on the differences between the siblings - they're close, but Pris is the responsible one, Mary Beth is the wild child - it soon heads off into all sorts of directions, with many other people.      Post-funeral, Mary Beth heads for the local bar for a few drinks, but has some trouble with local bad apple Gorski (Ebon Moss-Bachrach), who comes on to her, won't let up and - since this happens so early in the film, I'll give it away - is killed by her in self-defense, with a harpoon assist.      Uh-oh, this is not the kind of thing you want to be caught up in in a small town. Good thing steady-nerved Pris is around to figure out what to do, to put a plan in motion to get rid of the body. But this proves to be no easy feat, and in one of the film's best darkly humorous lines of dialogue, as they're trying to stuff him in a cooler, a shaken Mary Beth says, "What are we supposed to do, Pris? Chop his arms off?"      Well, yeah! And that very sharp knife with the Connolly fishing business name emblazoned on it should do the trick. And the endless ocean would be a great place to dump the cooler.      Time to meet more people. There's Enid (Margo Martindale), who runs the Ocean View B&B; (which really should be called a B&B;&B; because it's also a brothel). And there's a trio of longtime residents - Susie, Gail, and Doreen (June Squibb, Annette O'Toole, Marceline Hugot) who seem to know everything about everyone. And there are a couple of cops - one is a regular customer at the B&B;&B;, the other is an inquisitive man just doing his job.      Before you can catch a breath, a body washes up onshore, and when the sisters find out, they panic. But it turns out to be a bullet-riddled woman (no harpoon marks!) who worked at the B&B;&B;, and she wasn't exactly preparing breakfasts or making beds. Look out! Nasty, foul-mouthed working woman Lexie (Gayle Rankin) is soon making things even murkier.      By the time the expanding series of plotlines introduces a bag with $50,000 cash, and the Connolly knife has gone missing, you're wondering where else this story can possibly turn. Some sleepy little town!      The film is about all of these people and incidents, but the focus eventually comes around to Enid, and Martindale gives a frightening, multi-textured performance as a powerful woman who's juggling a lot of secrets.      There are questions everywhere you turn, and just about all of them are answered. But the writers-directors couldn't quite lick the problem of how to end it, and in an attempt to wrap things up, those answers are delivered too quickly, too neatly. And I'm still wondering why the film is called "Blow the Man Down."      "Blow the Man Down" premieres on Amazon on March 20.      Ed Symkus writes about movies for More Content Now. He can be reached at esymkus@rcn.com.      "Blow the Man Down"   Written and directed by Bridget Savage Cole and Danielle Krudy   With Sophie Lowe, Morgan Saylor, Margo Martindale, Gayle Rankin   Rated R

The original Wasteland came out over 30 years ago, which was followed by a ground-breaking sequel in 2014. Now, some six years later, Wasteland 3 is on the horizon. The team at inXile Entertainment have been hard at work crafting an experience that evokes the same emotions and challenges of Wasteland 2, while also ensuring systems and mechanics advance and evolve. With the release of Wasteland 3 scheduled for May 19, 2020, Shacknews had the opportunity to go hands-on with a preview build of the game on PC. We're pleased to report that it looks to perfectly capture the gritty, yet hilarious, nature of surviving a hostile, post-apocalyptic world while maintaining the tried-and-true combat and story building of the originals.

In terms of 21st-century rap beefs, Jay Vs. Nas is closely rivaled by Meek Vs. Drake in terms of sheer hysteria. We all remember that zany July 2015 night when Meek accused Drake of having ghostwriters, which set off a surprisingly one-sided war on wax. The two carried on their beef for years, until Meek ended up going to jail on a probation violation. Months after Meek's release, he came out during Drake’s Boston stop on the Aubrey and the Three Amigos tour, squashing the beef once and for all. They then collaborated on “Going Bad,” a feel-good single from Meek Mill's Grammy-nominated _Championships_ album.

The cyclones, floods and drought have compromised water and sanitation facilities and led to the spread of diarrheal diseases such as cholera, to which children are particularly vulnerable. UNICEF and its partners managed to contain the outbreaks of cholera after both cyclones, by vaccinating more than one million people, and quickly restoring several urban water systems, including the one in Beira which supplies approximately 580,000 people. The accomplished rehabilitation of 507 contaminated water points and the construction of 80 new ones, efforts to better monitor the chlorification of drinking water, the distribution of 648,000 bottles of household water treatment chemicals, as well as the construction of latrines for 185,000 people will help to protect the population from future cholera outbreaks and other waterborne diseases. UNICEF has also established Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) facilities for over 61,000 people in 34 resettlement sites.

The Euro 2020 soccer Championship, trumpeted as a continent-wide feast of football from Dublin to Baku to mark UEFA's 60th anniversary, was postponed for a year on Tuesday as the coronavirus pandemic claimed its biggest sporting casualty yet.


  The fate of the 24-nation, month-long showpiece due to start in June had hung in the balance ever since Europe's domestic leagues shut down in the wake of the sweeping health crisis, which has killed around 7,000 people worldwide.


  UEFA relayed the news after an emergency video conference with all 55 of its affiliated national federations and representatives from clubs and leagues.


  "It was important that, as the governing body of European football, UEFA led the process and made the biggest sacrifice," UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin said in a statement confirming what the Norwegian and Swedish FAs had leaked earlier.


  "We are at the helm of a sport that vast numbers of people live and breathe that has been laid low by this invisible and fast-moving opponent. At times like these, that the football community needs to show responsibility, unity, solidarity."


  Even as the video conference was ongoing, Norway's FA broke ranks to confirm via Twitter that the tournament had been postponed for the first time in its history. Swedish FA chairman Karl-Erik Nilsson also sent a message to Reuters during the video conference. "Postponed until 11/6- 11/7 2021," he said.


  UEFA confirmed those dates shortly after.


  On a frantic day for soccer organizers, south American confederation CONMEBOL agreed to delay this year's Copa America, due to take place in Argentina and Colombia, to 2021.


  With normal life on hold in Europe, UEFA's decision was widely expected, not least because of pressure from Europe's powerful domestic leagues wrestling with the nightmare scenario of incomplete competitions.


  "The move will help all domestic competitions, currently on hold due to the COVID-19 emergency, to be completed," UEFA said.


  Sixteen playoff matches were due to be held on March 26 and 31 to decide the full line-up of nations for Europe's once every four-year flagship tournament -- second only to FIFA's World Cup in terms of prestige in soccer.


  They could now be played in the international window at the start of June, subject to a UEFA review, while all other UEFA competitions and matches are on hold.


  The new coronavirus has infected almost 180,000 people worldwide since emerging in China, and most of Europe is in lockdown in a desperate bid to stem its advance.


  All five of Europe's top domestic soccer leagues -- England, Spain, Italy, France and Germany -- are suspended, along with the Champions League, Europa League and World Cup qualifiers.


  With the Euros and Copa America postponed, however, it provides a window for domestic competitions to resume and reach their conclusions even as late as July or August.


  Leagues had urged UEFA to give priority to completing domestic competitions, as clubs throughout Europe feared they would lose ticket and match-day revenue by not completing the season while still having to pay player salaries.


  "UEFA tabled a range of options so that competitions can finish this season safely, and I am proud of the response of my colleagues across European football," Ceferin said.


  Many south American players play for top European clubs, one factor in CONMEBOL shifting Copa America.


  "This means that clubs and leagues in Europe will have as little disruption as possible in the availability of their players," he said. "These coordinated and responsible decisions are deeply appreciated by the European football community."


  While the domestic leagues welcome the news, next year's calendar looks challenging to say the least.


  The Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon takes place in January/February, the women's European Championship is due to be held in England in the summer, while FIFA's revamped Club World Cup in China, featuring eight European clubs, is penciled for June 17-July 4, in the middle of the Euros and Copa America. World Cup 2022 qualifiers will also be starting.


  For now, however, there is a sense of togetherness from the federations about tackling an emergency that transcends soccer.


  "In the big picture, football is a really small matter," Tim Sparv, captain of tournament debutants Finland, said.


  "Now it's about life and death and trying to control the spread of the virus, so it's a good decision."


  Netherlands manager Ronald Koeman said: "It's a pity (that Euro 2020 has been postponed) but football is not the important thing in life right now. I had anticipated it would not happen."


  The European Championship originated in 1960 with a four-nation finals in which the Soviet Union beat Yugoslavia to lift the trophy. It evolved into an eight-nation tournament in 1980 and in 1996, when it was held in England, it grew to 16 teams.


  The most recent edition in 2016, again in France, included 24 nations for the first time. The final, in which Portugal beat the hosts, was watched by a television audience of 284 million.


  The 2020 edition, brainchild of former UEFA president Michel Platini, was supposed to be the first staged across the continent, rather than by a single or joint host nations.


  The host cities are Glasgow, Dublin, Bilbao, Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Munich, Rome, St Petersburg, Bucharest, Budapest and Baku, with the climax set for London's Wembley Stadium. (Writing by Martyn Herman, Brian Homewood and Ossian Shine; Editing by Hugh Lawson and Pritha Sarkar)

Canada, Italy among other countries have closed all borders in order to curtail the further spread and increase in COVID-19 cases.


  However, Buhari’s government has insisted that the border will remain open and that flights from Europe are welcome.


  Reno Omokri, however, says Buhari’s government has refused to restrict flights from high risk nations because former vice president Atiku Abubakar raised the suggestion earlier.


  The former presidential spokesman further appealed to Buhari to drop his ego and save the lives of Nigerians at risk.


  Omokri on his Twitter page wrote: “The reason General Buhari does not want to restrict flights from Coronavirus high risk nations is because the closure of borders was first suggested by Atiku Abubakar.


  “He does not want Atiku to get the credit. This is about ego. Buhari must drop his ego and do the right thing to save lives!


  Atiku had urged the government to restrict flights into Nigeria.


  Meanwhile, the Senate has asked Buhari to immediately impose travel ban on high risk countries as Nigeria records third case.


  The third case was confirmed after a 30-year-old lady who returned from Uk on the 13th of March tested positive of COVID-19.

LOUISVILLE, Ky. (WDRB) -- Many Kentucky residents looking to file for unemployment benefits in the wake of the business shutdowns caused by the COVID-19 coronavirus were met with frustration early in the week.


  As of Tuesday morning, the online system was down.


  "We are obviously experiencing higher volume within our systems," said JT Henderson, executive director of communications for the Education and Workforce Development Cabinet, in a statement.


  Henderson said the agency is working to increase its server capacity to offset the increase in volume.


  "We are asking folks to stay patient as we do this," Henderson said.


  Several viewers contacted the newsroom to say they were also having difficulty getting through on the agency's phone line.


  Henderson said he was not aware of any issues with the phones.


  A sign seen on the door of the unemployment office at the corner of South 6th Street and Cedar Street on Monday stated, "The unemployment system is currently down. We are unable to access any claims at this time. You are not able to file a claim at this time. Please check back tomorrow to make sure the system is back up and running. Sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused you."


  He added that more information would likely be provided during Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear's 5 p.m. news conference on Tuesday.

LOUISVILLE, Ky. (WDRB) -- Of course it was the right call to move the Kentucky Derby from the first Saturday in May to the Labor Day Weekend.


  The tradition of the Kentucky Derby is considerably more than a date on a calendar.


  It's a celebration of the horse-racing world, a gathering of community, an all-clear to disregard issues percolating in everybody's world.


  It's horse race to some, a happening to others and a party to anybody who wants to make it a party.


  This year, in these conditions, with these risks, gathering more than 150,000 people from around the world at Churchill Downs May 2 would rank among the worst things you could do as we try to navigate and defeat the coronavirus threat.


  "Right now the primary focus of everybody should be on safety," trainer Kenny McPeek said. "We can figure out the horse racing part later."


  So the Kentucky Derby moves to Sept. 5 and the 3-year-old fillies will contest the Kentucky Oaks Sept. 4. Bill Carstanjen, the chief operating officer of Churchill Downs, said the track's partners at NBC Sports will work to align the Preakness in Baltimore and the Belmont in New York City in the weeks following the Derby.


  Yes, this will conflict with the opening of college football season. Yes, the NFL will be looming. Yes, it won't be the first rite of spring as it has been for so many since its last postponement (to June 9) because of a ban created by World War II in 1945.


  Yes, there will logistical issues. Yes, there will be headaches and complainers. Yes, there be people who won't stop howling. Ignore them. Overcome them.


  Few sports have been ruled by tradition more than horse racing. Some traditions will be stretched. That could be a good thing.


  Like a growing number of trainers, McPeek has been an advocate for changing the parameters around the Triple Crown.


  Run the Kentucky Derby in May, the Preakness in June and the Belmont Stakes in July. Hall of Fame trainer D. Wayne Lukas has also proposed altering the calendar, mainly for the safety of the young horses.


  McPeek has won the Belmont Stakes. He has not won the Kentucky Derby, not in six tries. He finished second in his first try with Tejano Run 25 years ago.


  McPeek said that the odds were that he would not have a Derby colt on May 2. That could change by Sept. 5.


  "I've got a colt named Fighting Seabee who could develop by then," McPeek said. "You never know."


  "A lot of trainers are in the same position. Colts change tremendously during their 3-year-old season. The field will be a lot different than it looks today. It will give younger horses much more time to mature."


  Some traditionalists will give the Derby an asterisk. I'll give it a star. It will be proof that we pulled together. It will seem silly but necessary to worry about things like post position and jockeys on hot streaks.


  Yes, it will affect other tracks and the races that will be used to prepare 3-year-old colts to run a mile-and-a-quarter. Chances are the Derby won't be the first time these colts race at a mile-and-a-quarter in their careers.


  Yes, yes, yes. That will be different. Maybe the young horses will benefit from delaying the stress.


  But this year the Kentucky Derby can be something better, something for everybody to look forward to -- a chance to celebrate that we prepared for, fought and overcame this virus that is closing schools, restaurants, businesses.


  The coronavirus has put sports its place. Sports and the Derby can return when the coronavirus has been put in its place. The race can become an example of a world with sharpened priorities.


  "It's a smart move (to postpone the Derby), considering the uncertainty and all the health risks," McPeek said.


  As the coronavirus has reminded us that it's just a horse racing, the Kentucky Derby can return and remind the world why it's more than a horse race.


  It will be a Derby to remember, a Derby to celebrate, a Derby to cherish. It will be proof that we pulled together.

Speaking to Football Insider, Hutton believes a switch to Tyneside could help rejuvenate Jones' career.


  Hutton said: “I think obviously it’s well documented all the problems he’s had at Man Utd, so sometimes a little break – when you’re a Man Utd player everything’s highlighted times ten.


  “I think maybe going to a team like Newcastle, under Steve Bruce, where he can get his head down, work hard, obviously the manager will look after him, it’s maybe a good place to go.


  “Steve Bruce makes it a really good environment to go and work and be happy, just really enjoy your football. Maybe that’s what he needs to get back, we all know how good a player he can be.


  “Maybe Newcastle, he’d not get away with it, that’s not what I’m saying, but just concentrate on playing. I definitely think Steve Bruce is a guy – because I know him well – who can get the best out of players.”

Former Boise State stars Curtis Weaver, Ezra Cleveland and John Hightower (and hopefully John Molchon) will still know what their NFL futures hold in five weeks.  The NFL Draft has pulled out of the public glitz of Las Vegas April 23-25, but the basic procedure will proceed—in a very understated way, no doubt.  The draft doesn’t need the show, it just needs to happen.  With the NBA, NHL, Major League Baseball  and the PGA Tour on the shelf, the draft is going to be the one and only major sporting event of, perhaps, the next two or three months.  Huge.  The dicey part for NFL teams: they’re prohibited from conducting pre-draft visits to team facilities.  No pro days.  There’ll be some guesswork involved in this year’s draft, especially in the higher rounds.

Niall Horan turned to songwriting to help him process his split from ex Hailee Steinfeld.      The singers were first linked in late 2017 but ended their relationship at the end of 2018 - during which time the Irish star began penning songs for his sophomore album, Heartbreak Weather.      "I'm a bad communicator in relationships," he told Fault magazine. "I struggle to talk about things. I don't like to let things build up in me and songwriting does help get it out but it can happen too late."      However, Niall made an effort to steer clear of music that "makes you feel sorry for yourself", as he wanted to explore the range of emotions that come with heartbreak.      "I think when you make a breakup album, you can either write a bunch of songs that make you feel sorry for yourself or you can play around with it and make songs for all the emotions that you go through because it's not all upsetting," the 26-year-old mused. "With any relationship, there are fun moments and there are days when you feel like you're in a music video with the rains pouring outside as you watch crying through the window. I think when you go through a breakup you process the whole relationship and think back to amazing nights times together and the bad ones and I wanted that for this album."      Heartbreak Weather is out now.

Married restaurateurs Roddy and Aaron Browning of Vista said they’ve seen a 15 to 50 percent drop in business in the past two weeks and they can hardly keep up with the constantly shifting directives being handed down by the county, state and federal governments.


  Together, they run the 9-year-old Flying Pig Pub & Kitchen in Oceanside, and last October they opened a second, more casual pub in Carlsbad named Bantam’s Roost. By late Monday afternoon they decided to close their restaurants for now so their 50 or so employees can collect unemployment, though Aaron said the workers will still be at a tremendous loss.


  “These workers are like our family,” she said. “They all live hand to mouth, paycheck to paycheck. And they need those tips. They don’t just live on their paychecks.”


  Mike Rosen, who owns the rapidly expanding Crack Shack enterprise and Little Italy’s fine dining restaurant Juniper and Ivy, said early Monday afternoon that he planned to keep the restaurants open, although he was hoping most people would take advantage of takeout for the fried chicken venues.


  “We’re thinking that San Diego will probably follow the lead of Los Angeles and other locations (to close restaurants), so it wouldn’t be shocking that San Diego bans dining in,” he said. “The volumes are so low right now that people can safely social distance but I think it’s only a matter of time before things go the way of L.A.”


  He was right. Just a couple of hours later, the county held a news conference announcing the new restrictions, effective by the end of Monday.


  Even as restaurants try to stay alive by offering alternatives to dining in, the shutdown of dining rooms and bars will have a devastating impact on their businesses and their employees. Hours will be cut and layoffs will ensue, although workers will be able to apply for unemployment insurance.


  “It’s a destructive cycle, people are getting laid off and will have trouble paying their rent and car payments, and landlords will have trouble paying their mortgages and it’s out of everyone’s control,” said Rosen, estimating that business in recent days had been down about 50 percent. “We’re trying to survive like everyone else. Right now, we’re currently evaluating cuts in employees but up to now it’s just been hours.”

PORTLAND — Oregon Gov. Kate Brown on Monday banned on-site consumption of food and drink at restaurants and bars, a 180-degree turn from indications she gave earlier in the day that she would not order closures or curfews.


  Brown’s order, which takes effect Tuesday, March 17, allows restaurants to offer delivery or takeout service. But across Oregon, restaurants were electing to close entirely.


  According to state labor data, businesses employ about 155,000 food service workers.


  The development came as Brown continues to ramp up restrictions intended to keep people out of crowds and away from each other if they’re sick.


  She has ordered nursing homes and other licensed facilities to limit visiting to the 30,000 Oregonians living in such settings. She has ordered every public school closed through at least April 1, sending 580,000 students home for at least two weeks.


  And on Monday, she tightened the state’s ban on gatherings, now prohibiting any involving 25 or more people and urging Oregonians not to convene in gatherings of more than 10 people. She also urged any business that isn’t able to expand service to takeout or delivery to evaluate whether they should remain open.


  “Each action has a ripple effect across our state, both on a personal level and an economic one,” Brown said. “Working together, we can overcome these hurdles in an Oregon way.”


  On Sunday, Brown told reporters she was considering imposing a curfew or even closing the state’s restaurants and bars but on Monday morning, she said she decided against such actions. And four hours after that, she announced the ban on inside dining.


  According to Amy Lewin, spokeswoman for the Portland Business Alliance, her organization is evaluating the impact to its members, including the financial harm.


  The situation is similar at the Hispanic Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce, where Executive Director Carmen Castro and the organization’s business development team is working with clients to weather the impact of COVID-19.


  “I don’t have a lot of information to share about what members are saying at this point,” Castro said. “Our clients have expressed concern about their businesses as well as their own personal and family health.”


  The Oregon Restaurant and Lodging Association represents 2,600 members and more than 183,000 employees across the state. CEO and President Jason Brandt said Monday that his organization will be giving a presentation on the immediate needs of the hospitality industry and its employees two upcoming meetings with state leaders: the Governor’s Economic Advisory Task Force scheduled for tomorrow, and the Legislature’s Special Joint Committee on Coronavirus Response taking place Wednesday at 10 a.m. in the Capitol.


  “The first thing we have to start with is making sure there’s no one-week waiting period to access unemployment insurance. Given the current state of affairs, people cannot wait a week,” Brandt said. “Second, we should relax rules around the work search provision.”


  Work search provisions in federal law require one to be proactively seeking a new job when applying for unemployment, but Brandt points out that with the ongoing outbreak of coronavirus, the state is encouraging people to stay home.


  “If we’re trying to save lives, obviously that’s an exemption that needs to be made immediately,” he said.


  Outside of advocating in front of Oregon’s elected leadership, Brandt said, his organization is pushing out the message that there are ways to continue supporting your favorite local businesses. Purchasing gift certificates to redeem later — as long as their gift cards are not run through a third-party service — can help infuse cash into a small business you want to support now. Making use of drive-thrus, takeout and delivery service for those business that have chosen to remain open are also options, according to Brandt.


  “I think people would benefit from looking at the bright side down the road, once we get past this crisis … there is light at the end of the tunnel,” he said. “Today was a really tough day, but we’re focused on making sure we showcase the resiliency of this industry.”

SOFIA -- Bulgaria banned all foreign and domestic holiday trips until April 13 on Tuesday as part of efforts to contain the spread of the coronavirus.


  The Balkan country, with 81 confirmed cases of the new virus and two deaths, has already declared a state of emergency and closed schools, bars and many shops.


  The temporary holiday ban represents another heavy economic blow for Bulgaria, the EU's poorest member state, which relies on tourism for about 8% of its economic output.


  Announcing the restrictions, Tourism Minister Nikolina Angelkova said it would be irresponsible for people to travel for a vacation during the crisis.


  "It is very hard for me as a tourism minister to say that, but this is very important for the health of the people," she added.


  Bulgaria has already announced it will forbid people from 15 countries from entering the country, as of Wednesday, and many foreign holidaymakers have canceled reservations at Bulgarian resorts.


  Two large winter resorts, Bansko in Pirin and Pamporovo in the Rhodope mountains, closed their ski facilities on Monday after a British tourist in Bansko tested positive for the virus. Two other people in the resort tested positive on Tuesday.


  Angelkova expressed hope that the situation would improve by the summer, when tourists traditionally flock to Bulgaria's Black Sea resorts, but she warned that bankruptcies in the country's hospitality sector could not be ruled out.


  "It is impossible for the time being to forecast whether we will have a summer tourism season at all." (Reporting by Tsvetelia Tsolova; Editing by Pravin Char)

As you will be aware, part of the advice from 16th March was to avoid gatherings and crowded places.

A statement on the website reads:      In light of the COVID-19 pandemic and following advice from government, we have taken the decision with a heavy heart to close the Royal Albert Hall from midday today, Tuesday 17 March, to the public until further notice.      The safety and security of our artists, audiences and staff is, ultimately, all that matters.      We’ve been here for the nation for almost 150 years in good times and bad. We exist to be open, to entertain, to inspire. Our doors are made to be open to the world and so it goes against everything in our nature to close them. But these aren’t normal times and we find ourselves in the unique situation where closing our doors is the best way to look after the world.      The consequences of these national actions are going to be hugely damaging. The Royal Albert Hall does not receive regular government support and is dependent on income related to events, which will not be happening. The lost income from closing the venue will be financially devastating. We invest millions of pounds every year just to look after our building, but our main costs are our staff, whose livelihoods are at stake. We have committed to pay our people through various closure scenarios, and any support you are able to give us would be enormously appreciated.      No performances or tours will take place for the time being. All our bars, cafes and restaurants will also be closed. We will be in contact with all ticket buyers in due course.      Please note that our phone room will be closed from tomorrow, 18 March, and our Box Office at Door 12 is now closed.

Technical chart claims that Diversified Healthcare Trust (DHC) would settle between $3.12/share to $3.68/share level. However, if the stock price goes below the $2.28 mark, then the market for Diversified Healthcare Trust becomes much weaker. If that happens, the stock price might even plunge as low as $2 for its downside target. The stock is currently in the red zone of MACD, with the indicator reading -1.59. Traders are always alerted for the move of a stock above or below the zero line due to the fact that the reading is an indicator of the position of the short-term average relative to the long-term average. If the MACD is above the zero line, then the short-term average relative is above that of the long-term average, thus implying an upward momentum.

Dennis Lee Morland      Bon Voyage to Dennis Lee Morland, born on October 7, 1942. He was the first of four children born to Lee & Lillian Morland. In his early days, Denny joined The Church of the Roundhouse (where the devil can't corner you!), roaming the fields of East Bakersfield with his dog and getting in and out of as much trouble as he could. Denny leaves behind his siblings, Kellie Curran Willis and Gordon Morland, his daughters, Roxanne Wolfe and Marti Waite, and his four grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. He is preceded in death by his sister, Ardis Hutchison, his first wife, Pamela Mahan, and his son, Jeffrey Morland.      Denny loved having fun with his friends out in nature. As a young father, he would take his family on long camping trips up the North Fork of the Kern River, to the annoyance of his wife and itchy chagrin of his young kids. But no matter the misery, if Denny's day held a fishing pole, a river, and a fire, it would guarantee the flash of that big beautiful smile and glinting blue eyes.      Over the years, Denny worked as an electrician, travelling up and down the West      Coast, then back east to Ohio and Pennsylvania. He started his own electrical company, Cal-Test with his wife, Pam, in 1978. By this time, those trips up the North Fork were getting few and far between, but Denny's travels had introduced him to the joy of deep sea fishing. He bought his first boat, The Spirit of Troy, in 1982 and docked it in Channel Islands Harbor. Soon, he had relocated to Channel Islands permanently and married Jeannie McCormick. He bought the Scorpio, using it to travel south to the Baja Peninsula. Denny loved the thrill of the catch. He would bring home fresh canned tuna from his weeks on the sea, or fire up the barbecue after a day trip to Anacapa. But more than anything, that fresh, salty air and blue horizon would bring a huge smile and crinkly laugh lines to Denny's face.      Later in life, Denny returned to Bakersfield to be closer to his daughters and grandchildren. In 2015, he relocated to Vancouver, Washington with his daughter, Roxanne. He loved the mild climate and the beautiful Columbia River. Denny enjoyed eating lunch over the Columbia River and telling stories to his grandkids. He was quick to laugh, and even in his quiet moments, he would welcome the company of family and friends. Denny drifted away on March 12, 2020, surrounded by his children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. The family is grateful to PeaceHealth Hospice for the care and support he received. Memorial services will be planned for later this year. Contact [email protected] for details.

The guidelines say Americans should "avoid eating or drinking in bars, restaurants, and food courts" and to instead use "drive-thru, pickup or delivery options." The government also says Americans should avoid groups larger than 10 people, and calls on people to work and school children at home whenever possible, and avoid discretionary travel.


  "We'd much rather be ahead of the curve than behind it, and that's what we are," Mr. Trump said as he unveiled the guidelines in a thinned-out White House briefing room.


  Dr. Anthony Fauci clarified these guidelines are for 15 days, not through July or August.


  "I think the question that, maybe John asked, 'until July' -- the guidelines are a 15-day trial guideline to be reconsidering. It isn't that these guidelines are going to be in effect until July," said Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease official. "What the president was saying was that the trajectory of the outbreak may go until then. Make sure that we don't think that these are solid in stone until July."


  The recommendations stop short of urging all restaurants and bars or all schools to close, as an increasing number of governors and mayors are doing. The governors in Ohio and Illinois, for instance, have ordered all bars and restaurants to shutter.


  The new guidance, which had been promised by Vice President Mike Pence on Sunday night, also calls for basic things that the administration has been stressing all along, such as washing hands and avoiding touching your face.


  "We're calling on every American to do your part," Pence said on Monday.

For many firms, the outbreak of COVID-19 has meant staff working from home and more use of teleconferencing rather than face to face meetings. However, it’s a different situation for manufacturers because, despite investments in automation, reducing the need for staff on assembly lines, they still need to receive raw materials. The impact of Coronavirus is both global and unpredictable, and the supply chain shock it is causing will most definitely and substantially cut into the worldwide manufacturing revenue of US$15 trillion currently forecasted for 2020 by global tech market advisory firm, ABI Research.

  Governors in California, Ohio, Illinois, Massachusetts and Washington have ordered closures in response to their response to the pandemic. But on a press call on Monday, Brown said she would not follow suit after a conference call she was on last night with local elected officials.


  “One of the things that I learned was that particularly in our rural communities, restaurants are a key provider of meals to a lot of the elderly and vulnerable folks,” she said. “And we are taking these concerns seriously as we develop policy.”


  On Sunday, Brown indicated that she was considering curfews of restaurants to a “total shutdown.”


  One of her concerns, she said, was ensuring that public safety and health care workers “have access to restaurant food over the next several weeks.”


  Authorities in Ohio, Illinois, and Massachusetts have already ordered statewide closures of bars and restaurants. In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom on Sunday ordered closed pubs, bars and wineries but allowed restaurants to remain open if they reduce capacity and enforce social distancing.


  Brown said that Dr. Dean Sidelinger, the state health officer, reminded her that “when people drink in bars, particularly in the later hours, folks forget about social distancing.”


  That term generally advises people to be no closer than six feet to avoid coming into contact with someone who is infected. The incubation period for COVID-19 is 14 days, meaning that people could be infected for days before suffering symptoms.


  “From my perspective, a curfew made a lot of sense” as an option, Brown said.


  The governor said she was sharply aware of the economic impact of any decision regarding restaurants and bars, often a key source of jobs in communities across Oregon. They employ an estimated 155,000.


  “We’re talking about a lot of very small businesses,” Brown said. “In terms of Oregon’s hospitality industry and small businesses, we’re trying to figure out a way that they can survive through the next several weeks.”

Drake and Jay-Z never quite got into the all-out generational war that fans speculated about every time one of them dropped an eyebrow-raising subliminal. But between Jay calling Drake “Mrs. Drizzy” and Drake saying “I used to wanna be on Roc-A-Fella then I turned into Jay” on “Summer Sixteen,” it’s clear that they weren’t on the up and up for most of the 2010s. It’s unclear what specifically eased the tensions, but Drake probably was a step in the right direction. They finally mended fences with _Scorpion’s_ “Talk Up,” their first real collaboration since 2013’s “Pound Cake.” Both artists took it lightly over a brooding DJ Paul production, rhyming about their superiority and proving there was enough room for them to flex their power on a track together.

Aliko Dangote given an insight into how much Arsenal is valued


  If Nigerian billionaire Aliko Dangote is serious about buying Arsenal, he will at least have an idea of how much the players are worth.


  The Football Observatory recently revealed the values of the players at some top European clubs and Arsenal was among the teams.


  The results showed that Arsenal is the 15th most valuable club in Europe on the value of their players.


  The total amount that the Gunners’ players are reportedly worth is £624 million.


  This should give Dangote a small insight into how much he would have to spend if he wants to buy the Gunners from Stan Kroenke.


  The Nigerian billionaire is a long time Arsenal fan and he has watched as the club has struggled to compete among Europe’s top sides for some seasons now.


  He then promised to buy the club soon enough and he even set a time that he would buy the team.


  He, however, revealed recently that he has about $10 billion worth of projects to complete and that when he completes these projects, he would make a move to buy his beloved club.


  Arsenal’s fans have been unhappy with the way their club has been run by its current American owners and they will most probably be happy if Dangote can buy the team and spend the money that they need to spend to compete with other top European sides.

 The British Boxing Board of Control (BBBC) said all public tournaments under its jurisdiction were cancelled until the beginning of April, when the situation would be reviewed.
 "What the BBBC has said, which makes any event a complete no-no, is that we’re not sure that the right doctors and medics can be provided at these events," said Hearn.
 "And more so that if there is an injury at these events we don’t know they could receive the correct and right medical attention. As soon as that comes into play, it’s not even up for consideration."

Bloomberg) -- The crash in the Mexican peso this month risks dragging the government's popularity down with it, in a nation with painful memories of currency crises in its recent history.


  President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador held onto his strong approval ratings during his first year in office, even as the economy soured. As energy and construction investments were shelved and growth slowed to zero, he would often point to the strong peso as a sign that things were well.


  The coronavirus pandemic and last week's global oil price rout look set to change that, sending the peso tumbling to a record low.


  "For Mexicans, the peso exchange rate equals the success of the government," said Barclays economist Marco Oviedo. "If the peso is devalued, the president devalues."


  Lopez Obrador took office in December 2018, and over the next year the peso rallied 4.3%, the most among major emerging markets after the Thai baht. That strength was largely fueled by investors taking advantage of Mexico's relatively high bond yields, but that didn't stop Lopez Obrador from taking the credit for it. Before his daily press briefings he would ask his aides how the peso was doing.


  Over the last month, that was all wiped out as the peso lost 18% of its value, making it the worst performer of more than 130 currencies tracked by Bloomberg. Despite his dislike of a weak currency, Lopez Obrador said Thursday he didn't think the central bank should burn reserves trying to halt the sell- off.


  "From our perspective, we shouldn't intervene to artificially strengthen our currency," he said. "We have healthy public finances, and we won't spend our reserves.


  The peso weakened 4% on Monday to a record of 22.9 per dollar. It reached a fresh low during Tuesday morning trading before paring its losses.


  Mexican Peso Falls to Record as Trump Comments Drive Sell-Off


  The nation's currency trauma dates back to repeated devaluations in the 1980s and 1990s. In 1994, political turmoil in Mexico and U.S. interest-rate increases helped spark a peso devaluation that fueled capital flight in what became known as the "Tequila Crisis". The economy contracted 6.3% the following year, strengthening the association in the public mind between a falling peso and job losses and bankruptcies.


  Lifted by his anti-corruption discourse and folksy manner, Lopez Obrador won in a landslide in 2018 and rode through his first year in office with record- high popularity ratings. A Reforma poll this month showed his approval rating slipped from 68% to 59% as murders rose to a fresh record high in 2019, sowing doubts about his security strategy.


  Crude Slump


  Oil prices have fallen by more than 40% over the last month, and if they remain around their current levels of about $30 per barrel, the government will face an even worse growth outlook as well as a hole in its finances. Lopez Obrador's focus on reviving state owned oil company Petroleos Mexicanos staunched a decades long decline in production, which has leveled out around 1.7 million barrels per day.


  Crashing Latin American Currencies Curb Space for Rate Cuts


  Foreigners' appetite for Mexican bonds, which had underpinned the peso's strength, is unlikely to revive for the time being, as investors remain focused on moving to safer assets, amid the global sell-off, said New York- based Rabobank strategist Christian Lawrence.


  The peso may see even steeper losses if the oil price slump leads credit ratings agencies to cut Mexico's oil company Pemex to junk.


  "If your average person sees the peso is getting weaker, in their head they think something is wrong in the economy and the government is to blame," Oviedo said.

Elections haven't substantively changed in Missouri in over 30 years and it has a profound effect on how adaptable our elections are in times of crisis management.


   


  Election administrators, including county clerks, have extremely limited ability to offer voters choices for casting their ballot. Even in the most serious of circumstances -- like an emergency declared by the president of the United States or the governor of Missouri -- current Missouri law does not proactively serve voters.


   


  Elections happen the same way every year. Registered voters cast their ballots at assigned polling places around the county on Election Day. Voters that meet a limited list of excuses are able to vote absentee in person or by mail.


   


  There are only two election provisions that directly address elections administration in the case of an emergency, such as COVID-19. In one section, the Missouri Secretary of State may provide for the delivery and return of absentee ballots by "facsimile transmission device or system" in cases of a declared emergency. The law doesn't define what a facsimile transmission device or system is.


   


  The second section allows elections to be rescheduled or relocated, but election administrators have to individually petition the courts for that relief. There's no provision for a statewide disruption of elections, which means there's less likelihood of a uniform response.


   


  It has become clear that these two sections do not address the current challenges brought forth by COVID-19 during the 2020 election year. We hope to work with the Missouri General Assembly, secretary of state and governor to pass legislation before the August and November elections that gives election administrators and voters better options than currently allowed prior to election day in the event of a declared emergency.


   


  It is our view that health directors, emergency management directors, and election administrators should be able work together in the public's best interest to protect our community's health, safety and right to vote. Voters shouldn't have to choose to sacrifice one over another. The only choice a voter should be making is on the ballot they cast. Elections are about the people's voices being heard and we will always fight to protect that opportunity and right.

 Dennis Lee Morland Bon Voyage to Dennis Lee Morland, born on October 7, 1942. He was the first of four children born to Lee & Lillian Morland. In his early days, Denny joined The Church of the Roundhouse (where the devil can't corner you!), roaming the fields of East Bakersfield with his dog and getting in and out of as much trouble as he could. Denny leaves behind his siblings, Kellie Curran Willis and Gordon Morland, his daughters, Roxanne Wolfe and Marti Waite, and his four grandchildren and three great- grandchildren. He is preceded in death by his sister, Ardis Hutchison, his first wife, Pamela Mahan, and his son, Jeffrey Morland. Denny loved having fun with his friends out in nature. As a young father, he would take his family on long camping trips up the North Fork of the Kern River, to the annoyance of his wife and itchy chagrin of his young kids. But no matter the misery, if Denny's day held a fishing pole, a river, and a fire, it would guarantee the flash of that big beautiful smile and glinting blue eyes. Over the years, Denny worked as an electrician, travelling up and down the West Coast, then back east to Ohio and Pennsylvania. He started his own electrical company, Cal-Test with his wife, Pam, in 1978. By this time, those trips up the North Fork were getting few and far between, but Denny's travels had introduced him to the joy of deep sea fishing. He bought his first boat, The Spirit of Troy, in 1982 and docked it in Channel Islands Harbor. Soon, he had relocated to Channel Islands permanently and married Jeannie McCormick. He bought the Scorpio, using it to travel south to the Baja Peninsula. Denny loved the thrill of the catch. He would bring home fresh canned tuna from his weeks on the sea, or fire up the barbecue after a day trip to Anacapa. But more than anything, that fresh, salty air and blue horizon would bring a huge smile and crinkly laugh lines to Denny's face. Later in life, Denny returned to Bakersfield to be closer to his daughters and grandchildren. In 2015, he relocated to Vancouver, Washington with his daughter, Roxanne. He loved the mild climate and the beautiful Columbia River. Denny enjoyed eating lunch over the Columbia River and telling stories to his grandkids. He was quick to laugh, and even in his quiet moments, he would welcome the company of family and friends. Denny drifted away on March 12, 2020, surrounded by his children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. The family is grateful to PeaceHealth Hospice for the care and support he received. Memorial services will be planned for later this year. Contact martimomo@gmail.com for details.

The combined Wallowa County baseball team may not get to play much this season, as coronavirus precautions eat into practice sessions and games.


  But as of the season's short preview in early March, the team is thriving under its coach, Mark Ramsden. If and when high school sports can start again, they should do well.


  Five freshmen from Wallowa County will combine an additional five from Elgin may allow the squad to play a few more junior varsity games and give the younger players needed experience on the diamond. Malachi Roberts from Joseph Charter School is the team’s lone senior.


  The team lost several big hitters to graduation last year. Several juniors have started or earned significant playing time over the years, which will lessen the blow.


  Several players, including Flynn Nave and Chase Homan played American Legion ball last summer, which can be put to good use this spring.


  “Overall, with the numbers, it might be a better team than last year’s, overall,” assistant coach Jim Nave said. “The seniors last year were definitely star players, but when six players are returning, that’s a big part of the team and a lot of experience. It’s a faster team overall.”


  With Ramsden’s penchant for “small ball,” which includes lots of base stealing and bunting, speed is a good thing. He’s hoping the team spends a lot of time on base this year.


  “As long as they’re not being left there,” Ramsden said.


  “I feel like we weren’t bunting last year as well as we had earlier. We’re going to concentrate on everyone being able to put the bunt down.”


  The total school population for Wallowa County plus maybe Elgin has the squad playing 3A ball in Special District 5. Both coaches see Vale as their main competition. Burns also can play tough. The team competed well enough to make it to state each of the last three years.


  Ramsden knows he has good players and he has no doubt the team will return to state this year despite a lack of seniors.


  “Each of the past three years, we’ve gone to state with one or two seniors, so we have high hopes this year,” he said.

Bigger producers said they do not expect the closure of their tasting rooms to affect their overall revenue outlook in a commensurate way.


  Napa-based Delicato Family Wines operates four wineries and multiple brands that sell about 13 million cases of wine annually. While tours and tastings at the Delicato wineries Black Stallion Estate in Napa and Delicato Family Wines in Manteca, Calif., have stopped, co-owner Chris Indelicato said that such business accounts for less than 1% of his company’s overall annual revenue.


  “If I had to predict, wine club sales will go up dramatically,” said Indelicato.


  He said that years ago, Delicato — a fourth-generation, family-owned operation — was once a fraction of its current size, so he knows what it’s like to be a smaller operator and is concerned for such businesses.


  “I feel very bad for those wineries for whom a big piece of their business is interacting in the tasting rooms,” he said. “My hope is that this [resolves] quickly so that people can get their sales back.”


  Despite Newsom’s directive, some tasting rooms remained open Monday.


  Chris Kenefick, co-owner of Kenefick Ranch Vineyard & Winery in Calistoga, said that a nearby tasting room at Fairwinds Estate Winery, where his wines are poured alongside other brands, was still open on Monday. But foot traffic has been so light, he said, that it may close soon.


  Kenefick said the pandemic has put a damper on his company’s wholesale business, which accounts for about 80% of its sales. He said that two out-of- state events have recently been canceled or postponed.

  It was gathered that Eze and the deceased, one 59-year-old neighbour, Mrs. Adeyigba Oladipo, had always been at loggerheads and that day, the woman accused Eze of stealing her phone.


  Angered by the accusation, Eze allegedly attacked his accuser, killing her in the process and fleeing the scene. Two days after, he was arrested by the police at a motor park in Ijebu Ode heading for his hometown.


  When journalist met with the suspect at the Yellow House at the Ogun State Police headquarters, Eleweran, Abeokuta, he looked angry. He was being held in the homicide section of the state Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department for investigation and prosecution.


  He accused almost all his neighbours and their children of being his enemies, saying he was unhappy that he could not kill them all.


  “I am here because of a murder case. I stabbed my neighbour whose name I cannot remember again. We lived in the same compound in the Ayegbami area of Ijebu Ode, Ogun State.


  “The deceased (Oladipo) used to accuse me of stealing her property and whenever she accused me, other co-tenants used to support her. They would all abuse and shout on me,” the PunchNG quoted him as saying.


  Narrating how the murder happened, Eze said,


  “On that day, the woman (Oladipo) accused me of stealing her phone and I got angry. The next thing I thought of was to attack her with a machete. That was the main reason I killed her.


  “It was around 5:30am that Friday when I heard her abusing me in Yoruba, calling me ‘omo rada rada’ (useless child). I was angry and I stabbed her on the head. She had an injury on the head and she was shouting for help. One of the neighbours wanted to come to her rescue, but I chased that one away.


  “If I had the opportunity of seeing the other neighbours, I would have also attacked them with a machete and killed all of them. I even ran after one of them who wanted to fight me after I killed the deceased, but he escaped. It pained me that I did not catch him. If I had, I would have killed him too.”


  Asked why he didn’t make efforts to save his victim’s life, Eze said,


  “I left her corpse on the floor and I ran to the Sagamu-Benin-Ore Expressway. I slept somewhere on the road for two nights before the police arrested me.’’


  The suspect said he had a long time ago requested to be ejected from the house because he felt he was a stranger among the residents, including two who were from his tribe.


  “I had told them to send me out of the house if they did not like me rather than accusing me wrongly,” he said.


  On how he felt killing a human being, he said,


  “I don’t feel anyway. What I did is not worth the reaction of the people. But it was anger that made me stab her to death. Initially, I had gone to report them at the police station, but the police officers begged me and they settled the dispute among us.


  “How would I be happy with the people who maltreated me daily? I was expecting them to complain about me to my cousin who got the house for me but they did not. All my enemies are many in that house, including their children. The children in that house also copy the behaviour of their parents towards me. If possible, I would have killed every one of them. I had prepared to fight an unending battle with them.


  “The two Igbo people there are also my enemies. They are Igbo like me and people used to call them my brothers, but I don’t care if they are my brothers or not. They are not good human beings at all. They used to threaten me. What they used to do to me in that house is really frustrating.”


  Ironically, Eze said since being in police detention, it had dawned on him that he was in a big problem.


  He said,


  “I am not feeling happy because I know I have put myself in a big problem. I am not feeling normal here at all. The police should do whatever they want to do to me but I don’t want them to kill me.


  “They should call my neighbours and my cousin who got the house for me last October to ask them how many times I had complained about the way they treated me in that house.”


  The state Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, said Eze was arrested at Mobalufon Junction motor park at Ijebu Ode, where he wanted to board a bus to his village, Onueke in the Eza South Local Government Area of Ebonyi State.


  Oyeyemi said the suspect would have escaped if not that the police got a hint from the deceased’s younger brother who had reported the murder at the Obalende Police Station.


  The PPRO said upon receiving the report, the Divisional Police Officer at the Obalende station, CSP Omonijo Sunday, mobilized some detectives to the scene, where the victim’s corpse was recovered and taken to Ijebu Ode General Hospital mortuary for autopsy.


  Oyeyemi said,


  “Serious manhunt was launched for the fleeing suspect. The efforts of the detectives yielded a positive result on March 1, 2020, when the suspect was about boarding an Ebonyi State-bound vehicle but was apprehended by policemen who had already laid an ambush for him based on the intelligence they already had on him.


  “On interrogation, the suspect confessed to killing the deceased with a machete because she accused him of stealing a phone. He confessed further that he cut off the woman’s two hands because she wanted to struggle with him to collect the machete.”


  Oyeyemi said the police had taken over the matter and was not concerned about whether the deceased’s family wanted to prosecute the matter or not.


  Several attempts to speak to the deceased’s family did not succeed even as they were said to still be in shock over the incident. The neighbours refused to speak about the incident.

“None of us knows how long this is going to last; I think it’s a prudent thing to do,” said Ross Jay Rankin, head of the Santa Ynez Wine Country Assn. and owner, with wife Lyn Dee, of the winery Imagine Wine. “It’s a complicated situation but it’s not as bad as it seems because they’re not making us shut down production.”


  The owners of smaller wineries The Times spoke with expressed more serious concern over the closures. Such operators said they rely heavily on revenue generated by tasting rooms, where patrons typically try wines for a fee and make retail purchases.


  Rankin’s 18-year-old winery produces about 1,000 cases of Syrah and other wines a year. Customers can try and buy at his six-seat tasting room in Buellton, Calif. He said that there has already been a drop-off in business over the last month due to coronavirus concerns, prompting him to reach out to wine club members with a plea.


  “We sent a message to our customers that said, ‘Help, we need business,’” Rankin said. “We had a stunning response.” Customers who typically bought bottles of his wines, which range in price from a $28 Zinfandel to a $60 Syrah, bought cases of it instead.

And that was the idea, that everything would look like it was out of a catalogue. We had an amazing Production Designer Erin Magill who just has an incredible imagination. She's just an amazing artist with an incredible sense of colour and aesthetics. Erin is very resourceful and really just pulled out every trick in the book in order to be able to create the illusion that we wanted. It was just a lot of her innovation and her connections in order to be able to get us that look. She was so meticulous with the details of the space. One of the things that Erin and I talked a lot about is the idea that - production design is extremely important for every movie - but for our movie in particular it was a big storytelling element. Hunter is actively decorating the interior of the house. Every object and piece of furniture in it was chosen by her, and is an expression of her decorating the home in the way she thinks the wealthy, controlling, patriarchal family would like. But then there's these little moments, when her true taste and personality emerge, and these bold choices that become startling, like when she puts the red gel over the babies room window, or her choice of her vanity. I just though that was such an interesting story-telling element.

_Ozark_ certainly isn't a show with sweeping focus. It's weird, really, that the show's not as tightly written as _Breaking Bad_ , but _Ozark_ maintain a tighter scope, albeit one that's not as steeped in the art of grandiose storytelling. Still, the two shows are cut from the same cloth. Both put forth much moral ambiguity, and both shows make people root for the middle-aged white guy doing very bad things. Since this piece is geared towards folks who haven't watched the show, I'm going to try not to spoil much, but here's the basic set up: Jason Bateman (Marty) and Laura Linney (Wendy) portray parents who flee with their children from Chicago to (duh) the Ozarks. Wendy's a seemingly spoiled wife having an affair, and Marty, who works under the label of a financial planner, is actually money laundering vast sums of Mexican drug cartel dollars. Yes, that's not _quite_ as much of a leap as "high school chemistry teacher who's simply trying to afford cancer treatment (d)evolves into a drug kingpin." Both men are, obviously, ethically challenged, and there's the constant question of whether Marty will "break bad."

NEW YORK -- Brent crude fell below $30 a barrel on Tuesday to its lowest since 2016, as the coronavirus pandemic hits economic growth and oil demand while Saudi Arabia and Russia keep up their battle for market share.


  Countries including the United States and Canada, along with nations in Europe and Asia, are taking unprecedented steps to contain the virus, curbing demand for crude and products such as gasoline and jet fuel.


  Brent crude futures fell 22 cents, or 0.7%, to $29.85 a barrel by 11:42 a.m. EDT (1542 GMT).


  The U.S. crude benchmark, however, diverged from Brent and was modestly higher. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose 5 cents to $28.75 a barrel. It has slumped more than 50% since Jan. 2.


  Amid the loss of oil demand because of the pandemic, Saudi Arabia and Russia are embroiled in a price war that erupted after the two top producers failed to agree to extend supply curbs to support the market.


  The Saudi energy ministry said on Tuesday that the kingdom's crude exports are set to rise in coming months to more than 10 million barrels per day, as it plans to use more gas for power rather than burning crude.


  "There is still every sign of a price war on the oil market," said Commerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch.


  "If the announced production increases are actually implemented, the price risks plunging further towards the $20 mark."


  Brent's premium over WTI has narrowed sharply to 67 cents a barrel, reaching levels not seen since November 2016.


  Brent, the international benchmark, reacts more to supply from non-U.S. producers, so the anticipated increase in output from Saudi Arabia and Russia has hit that benchmark harder than WTI.


  When that premium - also known as the arbitrage - narrows, U.S. exports become less attractive because of the cost of shipping them great distances.


  "The lower priced Brent will be attracting additional cargoes toward Europe while the comparatively high priced WTI will be enticing imports into the U.S. while at the same time, curtailing export activity as the Saudis attempt to re-gain some long lost market share," said Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates in Galena, Illinois, in a report.


  The United States has said it will take advantage of low oil prices to fill its Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). Other countries and companies are planning similar measures to fill storage tanks.


  Rates to store oil at the world's main trading hubs from Japan to South Africa and the United States are surging as millions of unconsumed barrels of oil hit the market daily.


  Attention will focus on weekly U.S. inventory reports that are expected to show crude inventories rising for an eighth straight week. The American Petroleum Institute releases its supply report at 2030 GMT, with U.S. Energy Department figures due to be published on Wednesday.
