Now, the glitz and glitter of over-the-top Christmas lights, shop ‘til you drop, and hopes pinned on the puffy fellow in the red jumpsuit seem a long way from that Bethlehem stable where Jesus, our true hope and savior, was born.
 Perhaps part of the real wonder of it all is that any of us can worship the Lord of heaven and earth anywhere and anyplace – not only in huge cathedrals and mansions, but also in small churches, simple homes, emergency rooms, prisons, war fronts – even in a stable. Our own worship space is sheltered, secure and sacred. Our Father is there.

This is the fight that the fans want to see and it's a big-money fight, so thankfully both sides have been able to come together quickly and strike a deal. Oftentimes these negotiations in boxing involving money fighters drag on, but in this case, it appears that both Fury and Joshua are on the same page and want to make the fight official soon. The May/June timeline for the bout is perfect to give both men time to rest and recover during the holidays and then start to ramp up their training in the new year.

One evening, Keefe's father carried her down the stairs and into her partner's car bound for the hospital. She received a full-body CT scan, an IV drip and oxygen. The coronavirus was ravaging her body and clotting her blood but not to the point that she had to stay any longer at the hospital. That was Day 9 of her illness.
 Back at home, her fever continued to rage as her body and head ached. She fought off the worst of the virus for most of July. Keefe, a mother of two whose father lives with her and her children, took the pandemic seriously. She worried about her father getting the virus. She worried about other people close to her with underlying health conditions. And she worried about her own children who might not do well with the virus. She worried slightly less about herself, a healthy 35-year-old actor and adjunct professor at Gonzaga University.
 She acknowledged that even though she was very sick, it was still a moderate case compared to many who are hospitalized for much longer or lose their lives to the virus.
 "It wasn't a severe case, even though it felt like the sickest I've ever been in my life," Keefe said. "And it's a scary position to be in with my kids by my bedside."
 Months ago, if the novel coronavirus didn't send you to the hospital, you were likely deemed OK by doctors or even yourself. Many young people experienced minimal symptoms, losing their sense of taste or smell, or getting a headache that felt like a sinus infection. And then they were fine.
 It turns out thousands diagnosed with COVID-19 in the U.S. and internationally are not fine, however. Months after being diagnosed with the virus, their symptoms lingered, changed, reappeared or new conditions emerged.
 This group, called "long haulers," continues to face COVID-19 in many ways. Some have lost their short-term memory; others get monthly bouts of flu-like symptoms. Still more have what's called brain fog, or fatigue, gastrointestinal problems and breathing and sleeping problems.
 In Spokane County, the health district estimates that 64% of residents who have tested positive for the virus are 28 days beyond their illness onset. They are considered "recovered." As the pandemic months drag on, however, it's clear that not everyone who has had COVID-19, including young, healthy adults, is actually recovered.
 July was just the beginning of Keefe's fight with the virus, as her symptoms did not disappear but instead morphed into new ones. She began to lose some of her hair. The fatigue intensified. She began to experience brain fog, short- term memory loss and struggled to focus.
 Five months after her initial diagnosis, Keefe continues to experience symptoms that affect her day-to-day life. The brain fog is the most debilitating, she said, especially as an actor, where memorizing lines, rundowns and the like are vital to success. She is directing a show at Gonzaga this spring, and previously, she said, she could more spontaneously plan. Now she is judicious about her planner and writing things down or else she'll forget.
 "I can't say that I feel like myself, and it is at that point where I'm concerned or worried about when my brain and my memory and my focus will start to feel normal again," she said.
 Keefe said her brain fog is a lot like a part of her brain is asleep at the wheel, and she constantly has to stay as aware of herself as possible in order to stay present in discussions or meetings. She feels trapped sometimes, having to focus twice as hard as she normally would to stay on track in meetings or conversations. Zoom meetings can lead to extra stress for her as she fights to stay focused.
 "It can be mortifying when my brain goes to sleep for a second, and I have to reconnect to the people I'm articulating my thoughts to and do my best," she said. "Oftentimes by the end of the day my best is getting me by, it's not what I used to be, and it's not the same energy, focus or detail that it used to be, and that's painful."
 Symptoms months after diagnosis
 Alli Talmage, a 26-year-old Gonzaga alumna, got the virus this summer. Now a paraeducator in the Tri-Cities, Talmage has had ongoing symptoms from the virus, including an elevated heart rate even when just sitting on the couch, difficulty breathing and adjusting to extreme temperatures.
 She had been a dancer, participating in theater productions. Now she has been prescribed an inhaler, and climbing the stairs to her apartment winds her. She said her symptoms persisted enough for her to go to the doctor long after her initial bout with the virus.
 "I had to advocate for myself and be like, 'Hey this is not normal,'" she said. "Even though I have had health problems in the past, nothing is like this, and it's not the cocktail of symptoms I have now."
 Talmage reached out to Keefe after seeing she was diagnosed with the virus on social media in July. Finding community and others experiencing long-term symptoms not outlined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has become part of many COVID survivors' experiences.
 Groups began forming online in March and April as people infected with the virus early in the pandemic had adverse, seemingly not flu-like, reactions to the virus.
 Hannah Davis found solace in the Body Politic COVID-19 support group after she got the virus in March. Davis, who lives in New York City, had predominantly neurological symptoms. She spoke at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases forum this winter on long COVID, describing her short-term memory loss, which led to forgetting her partner's name or accidentally picking up hot pans.
 Davis joined other survivors still struggling from COVID-19 months later to continue to organize patient-driven research.
 The Body Politic COVID-19 Support Group brought Davis and countless others together to drive forward the Patient Led COVID-19 research, which resulted in the first survey of nonhospitalized COVID-19 patients, Gina Assaf, one of the group's organizers, told an international research forum last week.
 The initial Body Politic survey, published in May, found that COVID-19 patients of all ages were suffering from myriad symptoms that spanned far outside the flu-like group outlined by the CDC. Of the 640 patients surveyed, 90% had not recovered and were experiencing additional symptoms to what the CDC was listing at the time. The majority of patients in the survey were not hospitalized.

It has given the green light to competitions to apply to try out one of two protocols involving additional permanent concussion substitutes. Under the first, a team can make one additional substitution where concussion is suspected, but the opposition cannot make a change to compensate. The second, which the Football Association will adopt for a number of its competitions including the FA Cup, allows teams to make up to two concussion substitutes with the opposition permitted to make the same number of changes. In conjunction with allowing teams to make five changes in 90 minutes during an FA Cup tie, plus a further one in any tie going to extra-time, it means teams could use eight substitutes in a match. That could even in theory be 10 substitutions in the extremely remote event of both sides having two players who must come off with suspected concussion in a match which goes to extra- time. IFAB is yet to provide clarity on this.

ALEXANDRIA BAY — After close to two years, with ground being broken for the project in 2018, construction is now complete on the largest modernization and renovation project in River Hospital’s history.
 The sounds of hammering and sawing have given way to a modernized facility ready to offer the same quality of care to new and returning patients.
 To complete the project, more than $4 million was raised to support the Hope + Healing Capital Campaign and more than $100,000 of that was raised through River Hospital Employee Giving, funds that went to this construction.
 “Despite everything else that’s going on, we wanted to take this moment to really celebrate this pretty remarkable accomplishment,” said Emily E. Mastaler, River CEO. “It really does represent our community’s investments in keeping our healthcare local. Our community and our state partners really have assisted us in bringing this to fruition so that we can create a foundation for advancing rural health care for our future.”
 Housed in the new Medical Office Building next to River Hospital are Primary Care, Convenient Care and Community Behavioral Health services for children and adults, all co-located on the first floor.
 On the second floor are Physical Therapy and Behavioral Health/Trauma Services for active duty soldiers, veterans and first responders.
 Physical Therapy now has three times the amount of space previously utilized, with two private treatment rooms, seven treatment bays and a large exercise space with equipment that overlooks the St. Lawrence River and Boldt Castle.
 Trauma Services now have three group rooms, several individual therapy offices, an art therapy room, a kitchen, and a dining area.
 “It’s so incredibly timely for the way that this hospital renovation really showed up during this pandemic,” Ms. Mastaler said. “Having such an unbelievably modernized and new space with individualized treatment areas in the emergency department, the importance of that right now just cannot be understated, and so the design and then also just the execution right in time for it being an essential need for us, we’re very happy about that.”
 In the actual hospital, the Emergency Department now has a dedicated entrance for ambulance arrivals and a trauma bay for expedited care in emergencies.
 The number of emergency bays increased from five to nine, and patient privacy has been significantly improved by structural separation.
 The laboratory and cardiopulmonary departments have been renovated and expanded, both conveniently located on the first level, and the hospital now features a completely renovated and expanded pre- and post-anesthesia care unit, waiting room and registration area within the Ambulatory Surgery Unit.
 Significant investment was also made into capital equipment upgrades to stay current with advances in technology.
 Local community members now have access to state of the art facilities and equipment, expanded square footage, and opportunities for a variety of sustainable care models.
 “The clinicians are incredibly impressed with our new facility,” said Arminda K. Hunter, chief nursing officer. “The nurses are very pleased, the providers are happy with all the advancements made, and to top it off, I hear a lot of patients coming into our building and saying, ‘Wow, I haven’t been here since the project was completed, and I can’t believe how wonderful it is in here.’”
 The former Monticello Hotel, now known as the Macsherry Building, in honor of the family who donated it, houses the Administrative Offices and Financial Services for River Hospital.
 The first floor has been completely renovated, and the basement, second and third floors remain unfinished and will allow for growth in the future should the hospital need it.
 “I think that with all this going on in the world and with everything that’s happening, particularly in healthcare, it’s exciting for us to stop and pause and really use this opportunity to celebrate all of these efforts,” Ms. Mastaler said. “I think that this is a really nice way to say thank you to our community and thank you to our staff and patients. And what a better, more timely opportunity to see this hospital’s renovation come to life?”

Ko played only four LPGA events in 2020 — she competed six times on the Korean LPGA while riding out the coronavirus pandemic at home — but Sunday’s win and a check for $487,286 for finishing second in last week’s U.S. Women’s Open helped push her season earnings to $1,667,925.
 That would have been good for fifth-best on tour last season, when each of the 21 leading money-winners all appeared in at least 20 events.
 Kim’s realistic hopes of winning ended when she left a 25-foot par putt short on the par-4 15th to fall four off Ko’s lead.
 But the player-of-the-year award was still in her control at that point, and she finished that off.
 Mina Harigae (68) finished at 12 under, the fourth-place finish matching the best of her LPGA career.
 Lexi Thompson shot a 2-under 70 on Sunday and finished at 11 under, seven shots off the pace and tied with Lydia Ko for fifth.
 Thompson, the leader after Thursday’s first round, saw her streak of consecutive seasons with at least one victory end at seven.
 “Definitely a good ending to the year and to the week,” said Thompson, the native South Floridian who had about 15 fans following her Sunday even though the tournament was technically closed to ticketholders.
 She said she’s looking forward to some normalcy in 2021.
 “It was nice to have a few people out there supporting us,” Thompson said. “I think the fans make the game, so hopefully we’ll get back to that in 2021.”
 Sunday marked the end to the 18-event LPGA season that was cut almost in half by the pandemic and was shut down for five and half months from mid-February through the end of July.
 There are 34 events scheduled for next season, starting with the Diamond Resorts Tournament of Champions in Lake Buena Vista, Florida, from Jan. 21-24.

 The NHL wants to play games in the home arenas of participating teams, but is prepared to hold them in one or more "neutral-site" venues per division if necessary.
 Approval from health officials in the five Canadian provinces with NHL teams is needed for the Canadian clubs to play at home.
 TSN has reported B.C. hasn't signed off on the plan.
 B.C. health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said in a statement the province "continues to work with the NHL and the other provinces involved to find a safe solution for the return to league play. Discussions have been ongoing to ensure the proposal aligns with the restrictions in place across all provinces."
 The Canadian border remains closed to non-essential travel.
 Infection rates are rising across the continent as North America faces the teeth of the pandemic's second wave.
 The NHL pulled off the resumption of its pandemic-interrupted 2019-20 season this past summer thanks to tightly-controlled "bubbles" in both Edmonton and Toronto.
 There were zero positive tests for COVID-19, according to the NHL, but the setup wore on participants.
 Players and coaches were separated from their families for more than two months in some cases.
 There was little appetite — nor was it feasible practically or economically — for a similar setup in 2020-21.
 The seven teams that didn't take part in the summer restart — the Ottawa Senators, New Jersey Devils, Detroit Red Wings, Buffalo Sabres and the three California teams — get extra time to prepare for their first games since mid- March.
 Those seven start training camps Dec. 31, which is three days ahead of the rest of the teams.
 “The players are pleased to have finalized agreements for the upcoming season, which will be unique but also very exciting for the fans and players alike," NHLPA executive director Don Fehr said in a statement.
 “During these troubled times, we hope that NHL games will provide fans with some much-needed entertainment as the players return to the ice.”

 Engberg looked at the data around the Pfizer vaccine and didn't have any real hesitation about getting the vaccine.
 Evan Mew, a respiratory therapist at Seattle Children's, was more reticent about getting the shot.
 "I was a little concerned about how fast this went through. I have not really been one to trust this government this past year," says Mew.
 But Mew ultimately decided the benefits outweighed the risks and got the vaccine right ahead of Engberg.

 On Sunday, federal officials said the second vaccine from Moderna is starting to be shipped out.
 The first phase of the vaccine rollout is targeting health care workers and others who are at high risk, although the exact plans vary from state to state. It is essentially a dry run for the complicated logistics that will go into distributing millions of doses around the country to the general public.
 "Probably the biggest challenge is planning when you don't have information and details," says Dr. Danielle Zerr with Seattle Children's Hospital.

Period poverty made its way back into public attention when a Tesco store hit the headlines for restricting the sale of period products during the Welsh firebreak lockdown. After public outrage at the sanitary products section being taped off as ‘non-essential’ items, Tesco stated that they were following government guidelines- which, technically, they were. Despite the Welsh Government releasing a response tweet saying that period products are “essential”, the law still lists tampons, sanitary pads and menstrual cups as “non-essential, luxury goods”. If the Welsh government can confidently tweet this, then why has the UK’s legal categorisation on sanitary products not changed?

Tens of thousands of health care workers in cities and states all over the country got their first doses of the new Pfizer coronavirus vaccine this past week — a monumental undertaking both scientifically and logistically — and more than seven million doses of the Pfizer and newly-authorized Moderna vaccine are being shipped out this coming week.
 The process has faced some bumps, as states learned unexpectedly their allocation would be smaller than anticipated. But the arrival of the initial shipments still came as a huge relief to those who've been caring for COVID-19 patients since the early days of the pandemic.
 "A lot of us are tired, and this is an exciting thing to be able to have," says Rebecca Engberg, an ICU nurse at Seattle's Children's Hospital. "Hopefully it's the first step forward to trying to get things back to normal."
 Engberg was among the health care workers to get her shot at the hospital's vaccine clinic this past week. She's cared for COVID-19 patients and shares the exhaustion of so many other health care workers.
