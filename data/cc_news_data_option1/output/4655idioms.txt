However, after a second tier baptism of fire that has already seen them play six out of the top seven sides on their return to the division, Coventry are presented with the opportunity to make up ground with a run of matches against those teams around and below them, including facing fellow promoted sides Rotherham and Wycombe.

Den Vorstoß heißen bisher selbst die Kritiker der Corona-Maßnahmen willkommen. Im März legte etwa der politische Publizist Knut Mellenthin in einem Sputnik- Gespräch dar, dass außer massiven Lockdown-Maßnahmen kein Plan B entwickelt wurde und dass die materiellen Vorbereitungen auf den „Ernstfall“ in Deutschland (und anderswo) saumäßig schlecht gewesen seien.

Die EU wappnet sich durch ein gemeinsames Vorgehen auch besser gegen Preistreibereien der Impfstoff-Produzenten“, kommentiert Mellenthin gegenüber Sputnik.
