Once the travel arrangements, or lack of, for two of his players were worked through, Young took time to reflect on the season and the cancellation of the NCAA Championships that were to be held in Stillwater in less than two months.
 It was to be the first time the men’s and women’s championships would be held in Oklahoma since Tulsa hosted in 2016. The Cowgirls made an improbable run to the national runner-up that season.
 They later earned the right to host the 2020 championships at one of the country's nicest college facilities – the Michael and Anne Greenwood Tennis Center.
 In a flash, that was gone. The NCAA news was heartbreaking for Young and those surrounding the program.
 “It’s something we’ve worked four years for,” Young said. “We had a lot of plans. We were going to do a lot of things, not just for the tennis, but for the community. I think the event itself was going to be pretty special, so we’re hoping it’s something we can agree to just move the championship calendar back a year and we can host it next year. There’s so much that will go into that decision that we don’t know yet.”
 Could OSU host next year? Would the NCAA push championship locations back one year on its schedule?
 “I think they’re going to be consistent with all of the championships, as far as not just tennis but other championships that rotate,” Young said. “I think they’ll be consistent with whatever decision they make.”
 Regardless of what happens, Young is still disappointed he can’t host the championships this spring. He helped oversee new lights installed inside the GTC, resurfacing of the courts and the construction of two visitor locker rooms on the east side of the facility.
 Additionally, Young was planning a fan festival to be held just outside the facility. It was going to include an evening concert and food trucks.
 “The investment of resources and then the people – the supporters who have given the money for resources and those investments to take place,” Young said. “That’s what I feel terrible about, because people gave with the intention that this money was going to go toward a championship this season. Whether it’s people that gave to revamp our facilities or just to be a sponsor of the championship, it’s definitely a difficult moment.”
 One positive for Young is he should return the Cowgirls who were playing for him next year. Of the seven rotating players, there was one junior, two sophomores and four freshmen.
 Whether the NCAA Championships are in Stillwater next year or not, the Cowgirls will likely be competing for a national title in 2021.
 “I expect all of the girls to come back,” Young said. “I would be shocked if we had any changes. We have one recruit coming in, so we have to work through that. It should be a very similar roster next year.”

Buehler's Fresh Foods will pay its employees more than $250,000 in appreciation pay as they continue to work during the coronavirus pandemic, the company announced Tuesday.
   
 The Wooster-based grocery chain also has committed to retain all 227 employees who worked in its restaurants, which are temporarily closed during the outbreak. Those employees have been reassigned to other departments within the grocery stores.
   
 "Over the last three weeks the character of our employees has [shone] through and made a lasting impression on all the customers who rely on us, new customers, suppliers and other stakeholders who are connected to us," President and CEO Dan Shanahan said in a statement. "This has manifested itself with countless individual examples too numerous to name. Our people are truly inspirational and we are thrilled that we are able to pay this bonus."
   
 The appreciation pay for the company's roughly 2,000 employees will be retroactive to March 15 and continue through April 18.
   
 Buehler's, which is an employee-owned company, operates 13 grocery stores in Wooster, Ashland, Orrville, Akron, Jackson Township, Massillon, New Philadelphia, Dover and Coschocton.
   
 During the coronavirus outbreak, all Buehler's locations have a dedicated time for customers 65 or older or at high risk for COVID-19 from 6 a.m. to 7 a.m. Wednesdays.
   
 This week, Shanahan told Wooster Daily Record, Buehler's is focusing on training its customers to shop responsibly during the outbreak. Stores are making hourly announcements and posting banners instructing shoppers to follow four guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Stay home if you are sick, keep a 6-foot distance, cough or sneeze into a tissue and avoid touching your face.
   
 Buehler's also has volunteered parking lots at locations in Wooster, Ashland and Medina for potential drive-thru coronavirus testing sites, if those services become available in those communities.
   
 Giant Eagle, which operates dozens of grocery stores, pharmacies and convenience stores throughout Ohio, also announced Saturday that it will provide employees with $10 million in bonus pay. The Pittsburgh-based company will pay the bonuses retroactive to March 15 through at least May 2, though the company will reevaluate that end date in the coming weeks.

 “We are continuing to practice enhanced vigilance within our community and have isolated areas that housed the residents that tested positive, in addition to consistently following the environmental cleaning and disinfection procedures set by the CDC throughout our organization.”
 Colonial Vista, home to 184 residents, has also canceled all visitations with the exception of residents in hospice care, said Executive Director Aaron Lindholm. Residents live in single-person apartments and are asked to observe social distancing guidelines and shelter in place.
 Prestige Care added in its release, “We will continue our ongoing steps to restrict access and to implement safety precautions designed to protect our residents and staff.”

While Turkey’s demography is shifting in Erdogan’s favor as conservative families from Turkey’s Anatolian heartland grow relative to the Europeanized Turks from central Istanbul and the Mediterranean coast, the economy is faltering. In 2010, Erdogan promised that by Turkey’s 2023 centennial, Turkey would be one of the world’s top ten economies. Even before coronavirus, Turkey would be lucky to remain in the top 20 as corruption, nepotism, political interference in business, and broad mismanagement have combined to send confidence in Turkey’s economy into the gutter.”

Brittany Langston with Norman Regional Hospital said the community will likely see things it hasn’t before as a part of the system’s response to the coronavirus, such as trailers and tents outside of emergency departments for “pre-hospital staging.”
 “That is to prepare for a surge of patients that present to our emergency departments,” Langston said. “Our hope is to keep those patients that are presenting safe, as well as (to keep) the patients that are already inside the building safe.”
 Langston said they are working closely with metro hospitals to “deliver one message together,” like the united decision to cancel all elective surgeries and increase visitor restrictions to protect community members from the spread of the coronavirus disease.
 “We do have a contingency plan should we have a large influx of patients to care for,” Langston said. “Units have been dedicated so that we can cohort patients together as that's what's recommended by the CDC, and we are being very quick and nimble to adjust our care plans to be able to treat those patients no matter what level of care they may require.”
 Clark and President of the Norman Chamber of Commerce Scott Martin both said that these orders do not mean Norman is “closed for business,” but that Norman businesses are just having to be creative in the way they conduct operations.
 “We will get through this,” Clark said. “I'm excited for the fact that when this has passed us, which will be hopefully sooner than later, we will have policies and different standards in place that will make us better in the long run. And I'm confident for that.”

 Our news organizations have always had a special relationship with their local business community.
 Reporters keep tabs on what's moving in and out, chronicling the changing face of Main Street and the stalwart businesses that have spanned generations. Sales representatives work closely with local businesses to help them promote their goods and services, celebrate their successes and offer deals to new customers. We sponsor many community events, and our leaders serve on local business associations.
 As America has seemingly shut down overnight with the spreading coronavirus pandemic, our local business community has acutely felt the loss of its customers and its community.
 Restaurants that were bustling until just days ago, preparing for patio weather and taking reservations for upcoming birthdays and work events, now sit empty and unsure of when diners will next pass through their doors.
 Local gyms and day care facilities, which increased their cleaning regimens in recent weeks, have made the difficult decision to close in the hopes that it's only temporary.
 Countless downtown storefronts that relied heavily on foot traffic that isn't there anymore are looking at their bottom lines, wondering how long they can weather the storm.
 And so it is at this precipitous time that we're reaching out to implore our communities to offer a strong show of support for their local businesses. Just as we are doing all we can to bring vital news and information to help keep residents safe through this crisis, we feel just as strongly about supporting the local business community.
 The safety measures that have forced us indoors and away from others to help stop the spread of COVID-19 are the right thing to do. We're confident our strength and resilience will carry us through. But we also recognize our small business owners need us more than ever as they take their own precautions.
 To emerge from this with our communities strong and intact, we need to ensure that what make them special -- the coffee shop down the road, the local car dealership and our neighborhood music teachers -- are able to stay afloat.
 While we may not be able to give them our patronage in person right now, there is much we can do to show our support.
 Visit your favorite restaurant's website and purchase gift cards for yourself and others to keep some money flowing to their bottom lines. If those restaurants are still offering takeout or delivery, make a point to order from them now and again soon. And get gift cards for massage studios, arts and crafts stores, local jungle gyms and myriad other businesses.
 If your local shops sell their merchandise online, make purchases -- even if the goods won't be available right away.
 If you're shopping online for things you'll need while in self-quarantine, like home exercise equipment or activities for the kids, seek out local businesses to make these purchases.
 If you use a service provider who won't be needed or can't provide that service right now -- a dog walker, house cleaner, day care provider, a lawn service or any of the other folks who keep our lives in order and make them better -- consider paying the person or company regardless so they'll be there for you again when this is over.

In a likely unprecedented occurrence, both Greater Napanee Town Council and Lennox and Addington County Council held meetings outdoors last week.
 On the morning of Thursday, March 19, at a chilly 8 a.m., town council members stood in the parking lot outside the town hall and passed the municipal budget.
 That evening, Greater Napanee Mayor Marg Isbester put on her warden hat and led a meeting of county council in the parking lot of the Lennox and Addington County Museum and Archives.
 "I'm sure it was an absolute one-off," she said in a phone interview on Saturday.
 The open-air discussions occurred for public safety during measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19, the novel coronavirus that led the World Health Organization to declare a global pandemic on March 11.
 Following Ontario Premier Doug Ford's announcement of a state of emergency in the province on March 17, Greater Napanee closed all of its municipal buildings to the public and made its municipal offices accessible by phone only.
 Neither county nor town council is set up to live-stream its meetings to the public, and so to make those meetings publicly accessible, they were held outdoors.
 "We also didn't want to put our staff risk at either tier," Isbester said.
 At both meetings, council passed a delegation of authority to town and county staff allowing them to release up to $50,000 to make emergency decisions not related to the budget.
 "It's for emergency, and there will probably be very little," Isbester said.
 Even though Greater Napanee's budget has been passed, it will likely need to be re-examined, Isbester said.
 "Revenues are being cut. At the town level we have no idea … we can't rent our facilities, we don't know what is going to happen as far as fee-for-services going through."
 Isbester said there is no word yet as to what aid will be coming from the federal or provincial governments to help with lost revenue and assist in taking pressure off of residents suffering a loss of income.
 In the meantime, both tiers of the municipality will do what they can to help citizens through this time of economic uncertainty.
 "We'll be looking at any cost deferrals or advantages we can give to our ratepayers to try to make it easier," Isbester said. "So many of them are without jobs right now. The world has almost stopped spinning. We need to be able to be responsible to them, without breaking the bank."
 In the meantime, Isbester urged the residents of Greater Napanee and Lennox and Addington County to "help flatten the curve" -- not only for the sake of public health, but for the sake of the economy.
 "I cannot believe the amount of people that are still gathering in groups," she said. "If people don't look at this, if people don't do what they're supposed to do, we could be in the same position in September and October. Take a page out of the countries … that have done it right."
 She is worried what the future holds for her municipality and for the province.
 "Our province is in pretty good shape. Our health system is in good shape. But this could put us into a real state of not just recession, but depression. The more we can do now, the better off we can do," she said.
 Isbester said Napanee is in good shape, for now.
 "We can tough it out. But without revenue we can't tough it out forever, and neither can the province or the feds. It'll bring us to our knees," she said.
 Isbester praised her town councillors for being keen to help Napanee residents. Meetings to discuss measures to ease financial stress won't happen for at least another couple of weeks, she said, while the town figures out a way to live-stream to the public.
 "I look at my own council trying to meet the needs of everybody. There's a good level of respect for helping people make it through," she said. "We have to be financially responsible, but we also have to have a heart and know what's happening to our public out there."

Dear Dave,   In light of recent events in our country, do you have suggestions for things people should think about and plan for if they get laid off from their jobs?   Sam
 Dear Sam,   It's no secret that things are shutting down all across the world. If your workplace has closed its doors and isn't offering pay, then it's time to regroup and get some things in order. The thought of being without a paycheck can be overwhelming, but a little thought and planning can help you get through times like these.
 Start living on a budget, if you aren't doing so already. Making a monthly budget will show you exactly where your money is going. Without it, you can't use every dollar to its fullest potential, because you don't even know how much money you have to work with. Plus, your budget will show places where you can cut back and save money.
 If you don't have any income right now, make a budget based on the amount of money on hand. If you have $600 left to your name, budget out exactly where each of those dollars will go. It's time to squeeze every last penny out of what you've got. If you still have cash coming in from a spouse's job or some other source, then adjust your budget to reflect that. Maybe the two of you usually bring in a combined $5,000 a month. Adjust your budget to live off that one income for the time being.
 When the going gets tough, you need to focus on the things you really need to survive - food, utilities, shelter and transportation. I call these the Four Walls. If there's any money left over after you take care of the Four Walls, make a list of what else you need to pay, and tackle those in order of importance. Reach out to anyone you can't pay, and explain the situation. They might be able to work something out, but they can't help if they don't know. Be upfront with them, and pray for the best.
 When you're just trying to make it to another day, you don't need to pay extra on debt. Instead, focus on piling up cash. Once life gets back to normal and everything is okay, you can pick up where you left off with your debt snowball. If it's within your budget to keep making minimum payments on your debt, go for it. But the Four Walls come first. This is also the time to sell anything and everything you don't need to make some extra cash.
 With so much being shut down right now, there might not be as many traditional ways to make extra money. So, look into driving for Amazon, delivering takeout food or dropping off grocery orders. Even if one of those doesn't work out, you can still take up odd jobs around your neighborhood. Be on the lookout for opportunities that will add a few extra bucks to your pocket. Don't forget to cut back on unnecessary expenses, either. Stop or pause your subscriptions. Call your cable, internet and cellular providers to see if there's anything they'll do to work with you.
 Finally, in times of real need, don't be too proud to ask for a helping hand. Many churches and community groups in your area exist for situations just like this.
 God bless you all!   Dave

Estar en unos Juegos Olímpicos es el principal sueño de todo deportista; obtener el cupo, su mayor reto. Sin embargo, este año, el camino a Tokio 2020 ha presentado un obstáculo jamás imaginado, el coronavirus. Muchos deportistas nacionales veían preocupados cómo su agenda de cara a Tokio 2020 se iba desmoronando, tras la suspensión de sus torneos. Pero este miércoles, los que aún no han clasificado recobraron la esperanza. Con la postergación de los Juegos, varios peruanos mantienen sus opciones de clasificar. Es el caso de Alexandra Grande, quien saludó la decisión del Comité Olímpico Internacional de postergar hasta el próximo año la cita multideportiva. “Ha sido la mejor decisión que han tomado, porque primero es la salud del mundo. Si se daban los Juegos, no todos iban a tener la misma preparación”, le dijo la karateca nacional a Depor. ‘Ale’ ya había sufrido los efectos del coronavirus en su deporte luego de que se cancelara dos torneos (Marruecos y Madrid) que daban puntos para Tokio 2020. Debido a ello, la Federación Internacional de Karate tuvo que cerrar la calificación olímpica mediante ranking hasta esa fecha. Eso generó que la karateca peruana se quede a cinco puestos de clasificar por esa vía. Por el ranking, solo los cuatro primeros puestos de cada modalidad obtenían el boleto a Tokio 2020, Alexandra terminó en la novena posición. Sin embargo, la otra opción de Alexandra Grande es el Preolímpico de París, que en un primer momento también se vio afectado por el coronavirus. El torneo estaba programado para mayo, pero luego fue pospuesto para junio. Con el aplazamiento de Tokio 2020, el Preolímpico de Karate volverá a ser reprogramado. Esto hará que Alexandra Grande tenga más tiempo de preparación en busca de ese ansiado cupo. “Ya me enteraré de la nueva fecha en los próximos días. Para nosotros (los que buscan la clasificación) nos da tiempo de tener mucha mayor preparación”, contó la bicampeona panamericana. Cabe señalar que, en caso lo requiera, la otra alternativa de clasificación de Alexandra Grande es a través del ranking de América. Tras ser bicampeona panamericana, la peruana se posiciona en el primer lugar.

Bollywood diva Katrina Kaif had earlier been making headlines all around about starring alongside legend Amitabh Bachchan.
 However, the chitchat has now been put to rest about Amitabh Bachchan and Katrina Kaif taking on the father-daughter role in _Super 30_ director Vikas Bahl's next, titled _Deadly_.
 As per _Hindustan Times_ , the _Bharat_ actor has turned down the role following the sexual misconduct allegations that came afloat earlier about the filmmaker.
 The actor was immensely criticized online after news came around about her being part of the project. Soon after that, the actor issued a clarification that she has turned down the role.
 The news was refuted by _HuffPost_ journalist Ankur Pathak who had initially condemned Katrina for working with Bahl but was later reached out to by the actor who termed the hearsay completely 'untrue.'
 Earlier, it was reported that the film that features the central character of a father had finalized to take on the role Amitabh Bachchan.
 The film that may also rope in Ananya Panday and Ishaan Khatter was supposed to go on floors but owing to the coronavirus pandemic, the filming has been put on ice for now.

Maybe you had to cancel your dream vacation, and you’re planning on rescheduling it as soon as possible. But if you’re undecided on where your next adventure should be, use your downtime to shop around for the ideal place. Start off with a wish list of countries you most want to visit for the first time, or a favorite vacation you’d love to repeat. Then narrow down your options by factors like budget, geopolitics, required visas, travel time, and the amount of time you need to explore that country (a long weekend in Paris or London is lovely, but if you’re heading to Australia, it’s ideal to have a few weeks).

“After about an hour of cruising and having the on-duty police officer stop us to telling we were called in for honking our car horn, we headed home,” Graham said. “But after reading the responses on social media about our impromptu cruise, I decided to make an event for Saturday.”
 Graham and Lindquist both said the respective cruises are just fun ways to get out of the house while still practicing social distancing. That’s something they said is needed by a lot of people in the face of the pandemic and the rules associated with it.
 “With all that is going on with COVID-19, it’s a stress release, a way to get folks out and about without impeding on one another’s six-foot personal bubble,” Graham said. “It should help ease the tension for a bit that we all get from watching the news. Plus, it brings back nostalgia of what use to be.”
 The Ackley loop hasn’t changed much over the years, nor have the stop spots along the way, although the businesses along the route have. The triangle park uptown that splits Main Street and Park Avenue was the centerpiece, though. Former cruiser and longtime Ackley Police Officer Pat Scallon remembers the route well.
 “Around Main Street and Park Avenues, then down Franklin Street to US 20 to the Holiday Station, turn through Holiday back onto 20, on to Shugar's Super Value and the old Bowling Alley then back around Main Street again,” Scallon said. “Gas was 33.9 cents a gallon, though.”
 An official map will be released on the Cruising A-Town Facebook page.
 Graham wants it to be a fun thing as well. He said people need an escape, especially now.
 “My wife Cari and I plan on packing up our kids again and staying in Cari's van to keep ourselves from being potentially exposed,” Graham said. “I'd encourage others to be mindful of their social distancing and keep their vehicle occupied with their immediate family, significant others, spouse or date(s). But most importantly, have fun for a few hours Saturday night to take our mind off this pandemic in a safe, fun way.”
 Lindquist remembers the fun she had cruising the loop back in her day. She’s planning to break out her yellow Cadet cheerleading jacket, in fact. For now, it’s an escape from the news for a while, and needed time out of the house.
 “We don’t really have anywhere we can go right now,” said Lindquist, mother of three. “This should be a fun, safe thing and hopefully we can do it again in the summer. Maybe figure out a way to make it a fundraiser. But this time around, I think we all just need to get out and say hi to one another.”

The England and Spurs captain has been sidelined since suffering a torn hamstring during a Premier League defeat at Southampton on New Year's Day.
 Kane has made swift progress with his rehabilitation and would be back in full training next month if the season was not on hold due to the coronavirus pandemic.
 "I'm not too far away – I'd normally hope to be back with the team in two or three weeks’ time," he said.
 "I'm at a good stage, pretty much doing everything, now it’s about building up my fitness.
 "From a rehab and personal point of view, I’m in a good place, I'm doing really well.
 "I’m at a good stage now and just working hard, doing a lot of recovery, a lot of rehab and just waiting to see what happens to the season.
 "Other than that, my family is well. Obviously everyone is thinking about coronavirus at the moment and it’s a time to be together, to stay safe and hopefully everything will be alright."
 The Premier League season has been suspended until at least April 30, with the campaign extended 'indefinitely' as the United Kingdom begins a lockdown.
 Kane added: "It's such a strange situation, no-one has been in this situation before. Like anything, you have to take the positives out of it and do what you can.
 "So far, me and the family are well, and I'll continue to work hard, work in the gym, work from home and do what I can. We'll just have to wait and see.
 "I'm taking it all as it comes but for the time being, I'm in a good place, happy where I'm at and let's see what happens."
 Prior to his injury setback, Kane had scored 11 goals in 20 league appearances this season.

Over one hundred MFA students from the Yale School of Art (SoA) have called for a partial tuition refund following the university's decision to empty its campus and shift curricula online in order to help stem the global outbreak of the novel coronavirus, which has infected at least one member of the Yale community. "We are deeply troubled by the far-reaching repercussions of this event, which has tangible and unfathomable implications for our physical and mental health, financial security, professional careers, housing, and immigration status," the students wrote of the closure in a letter addressed to Yale president Peter Salovey and dean Marta Kuzma. "Moreover, it has severely curtailed the viability of the unrivaled visual arts education that SoA claims to provide. In light of these circumstances, we believe that financial reimbursement must play a part in the university's forthcoming actions."
 As the United States emerges as an epicenter of the pandemic--there have been more than thirty thousand cases and three hundred coronavirus-related deaths in the country--hundreds of universities nationwide have transitioned to makeshift online classrooms using services like Zoom. This has proven a pedagogical overhaul for art schools, where courses largely revolve around studio practice and in-person critiques. Amid the scramble to restructure, thousands of thesis shows--considered a milestone culmination of an art student's education--will be canceled, postponed, or consigned to virtual exhibitions.
 Like many art schools, Yale has temporarily shuttered its studios and art facilities--effective March 23--without which students claim they cannot continue their educations. In a March 21 letter sent to Yale art students, who were returning from spring break, Kuzma urged them to remember that "we are part of a larger national and international community of peers within graduate programs of visual arts who are also facing these challenges, and who will also share in this method of instruction, mentorship and revised engagement."
 But the Yale signatories, while expressing their appreciation for their school's necessary precaution, argue that this change will break a promise between the institution and its tuition-payers. "The reasons why many of us have chosen to come here--to take part in a spirited community of artists who create ​together, to hone our powers of observation and sensitivity to each other's work, to interact meaningfully with renowned faculty and visiting artists, to showcase our works in public exhibitions--just to name a few--are no longer tenable," reads the letter, also dated March 21.
 The Yale Art School is just one among a growing number of arts student bodies insisting on reimbursement. Students at New York University's Tisch School of Arts launched a change.org campaign last week after its dean, Allyson Green, announced that no refunds would be offered to spring semester students; it has over 1,500 signatories. A similar petition exists for New York's School of Visuals Arts and the Maryland Institute College of Art's LeRoy E. Hoffberger School of Painting.
 "This is an unprecedented disaster," Deborah Obalil, the executive director of the Association of Independent Colleges of Art and Design, told Artnet, speaking of the pandemic. "While institutions have many disaster plans in place for immediate disruptions to the campus, such as earthquakes, fires, floods, or tornadoes, the constantly changing directives from local, state, and federal health authorities mean that institutions are having to quickly adjust for the safety and well-being of their campus communities."
 The letter from the Yale School of Art students concludes: "Like you, we are devastated that our semester will not conclude as imagined. More than anything, we value transparency and empathy from the university, with the understanding that everyone is still finding their bearings in this unfolding crisis. We hope that this letter will be a fruitful point of departure."
