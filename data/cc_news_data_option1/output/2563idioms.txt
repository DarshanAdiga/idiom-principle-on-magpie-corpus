Do fans really want to see another early playoff exit?
 If the Wild lose to the Canucks, they would have a 1-in-8 chance at drafting a player who could instantly alter the landscape of the franchise. To say Lafreniere would expedite the rebuilding process in the Twin Cities would be putting it lightly.
 He finished with 112 points (35 goals, 77 assists) in 52 games this past season, becoming the first player since Crosby to be named the best player in the Canadian Hockey League in back-to-back season. Not only would Lafreniere give the Wild a foundational piece for the future, he would serve as a perfect counter punch to Russian sniper Kirill Kaprizov, 23, who plays the same positions and is expected to sign with the Wild at some point this offseason.

Indians players will be able to work out in a larger and more official capacity this week, but in reality that is the next step after several weeks or months of work put in at home.
   
 After about three months since baseball was shut down because of the COVID-19 pandemic, hitters were going to need a few weeks to regain their timing and pitchers were going to need a few weeks to ramp up their volume.
   
 Players have been working out from home, and pitchers have been throwing and doing what they can. In a rushed, shortened spring training 2.0, teams now have roughly three weeks to ensure their pitching staffs are in order. Expanded rosters -- 30 to start the season, which lowers by two each two weeks until it settles at 26 -- will help teams manage bullpens and not overwork starting pitchers.
   
 In the Indians' case, they feel comfortable with where their talented starting rotation stands based on what Shane Bieber, Mike Clevinger and others reported to the team recently.
   
 "We're going into it thinking our pitchers will come in ready to go and compete in some form of game environment. And I would say that would be the case for at least 80% of them," Indians president of baseball operations Chris Antonetti said via a Zoom call. "I'll give our pitching group and our performance group a ton of credit for the interactions they've had regarding the players and how to prepare them, both mentally and physically to be able to hit the ground running.
   
 "And we've done that through dialogue with players, where they're self- reporting how they're doing, but we've also seen it through video and data and evidence, whether that's radar guns, TrackMan, Rapsodo, whatever technologies that are available to them to be able to provide some feedback. And then our coaches have some objective measures beyond what our players are self- reporting."
   
 The Indians, along with the other 29 MLB clubs, will have to rely primarily on simulated and intrasquad games to get everyone in the 60-man player pools ready for Opening Day. The Indians hope to schedule three exhibition games with other clubs at the end of spring training 2.0, but logistics are still being worked out. For the next few weeks, the most interesting matchups will be Bieber vs. Francisco Lindor, Clevinger vs. Jose Ramirez or Carlos Carrasco vs. Carlos Santana.
   
 Indians manager Terry Francona said all of the team's starting pitchers are expected to already be out to 65 pitches, or about four innings. That means having enough pitchers to get everybody at-bats won't be an issue.
   
 "From talking to [pitching coach Carl Willis], I think we actually have way too much pitching, where the hitters are going to be tired," Francona said via a Zoom call. "We have to be sensible. We haven't seen them for three months. We don't want to just give them 10 at-bats the first day because we're trying to play catch-up. We're going to have to walk a fine line there. We'll communicate with the guys and we'll listen to them. We'll take the first three or four days to see how their legs look, because we don't want to hurt anybody."
   
 Where the pitchers sit during games might also be an adjustment. In an effort to spread everyone out, it's possible starting pitchers not playing in that day's game could be sitting in the stands. That could also be the case for relievers, who could spread out in the stands and then walk down to the bullpen when needed.
   
 Francona thought pitchers in the stands might be a bit silly, so the Indians could have starters on their off days come in later and do their individual work during games.
   
 As with almost everyone and everything else, little is set in stone and each team is trying to figure out how to best adjust to the new reality.
   
 "[Having starters show up later] goes against everything we've always believed in as a team, because we've always talked about the starters being there for the position players," Francona said. "But this is different this year. So, we need to adapt a little bit. Anytime we have open space, like in the weight room where guys can get work done, we might as well take advantage of it. That's one way we can make an adjustment."

Iowa State football coach Matt Campbell -- a graduate of Perry High School -- is helping his assistant coaches offset a portion of the 10% salary reduction they will absorb during the athletic department's temporary COVID-19 salary cuts.
   
 According to documents the Register received through Iowa's Open Records Law, Campbell's 10% salary reduction between July 1, 2020, and June 30, 2021, amounts to a total of $497,124 -- $350,000 based on the reduction of his average of $3.5 million-a-year salary through Dec 31, 2025, and an additional $147,000 to offset some of the reduction from an assistant coach salary pool.
   
 Last year, Iowa State spent about $5 million on football assistants. It's unknown how many were asked to take temporary reductions in pay, but an Iowa State athletics spokesman told the Register it was being used to help defray the pay hit to his staff.
   
 Campbell's gesture was included in documents the Register obtained June 23, including details of a contract amendment Campbell signed in January.
   
 The basics of that agreement were reported last December, including an extension through 2025 of a deal that pays him an average of $3.5 million a year. That contract included a $6 million buyout if Campbell takes another coaching position.
   
 The recently obtained amendment includes previously unreported bonuses of $250,000 if Iowa State wins at least eight regular-season games, and $500,000 for nine or more regular-season victories.
   
 Pollard announced in April that Iowa State coaches and some athletics department staffers would take a pay cut to help the department make up for lost revenue due to canceled Big 12 and NCAA basketball tournaments.
   
 The plan included a "one-year, temporary pay reduction for athletics department coaches and certain staff," including Pollard.
   
 The salary cuts were made to help offset a $5 million shortfall the department faced after the cancellation of the Big 12 and NCAA men's and women's basketball tournaments.

The strong guidance and current performance show that shares held up well, and despite a dip to the low teens, they now trade around $22 per share, meaning the shares have nearly doubled over the past year.
 ## Current Take
 With debt overhang essentially disappearing over the past year driven by deleveraging and improved earnings power, the situation actually does look better than it did a year ago despite COVID-19. This kind of recovery scenario was exactly what I hoped for and saw as potential realistic when I looked at the shares last year, yet I only kick myself from not having a meaningful position.
 Right here and now, the company is demonstrating on solid improvements as, based on the current realistic earnings performance of close to $2 per share, this shows that multiples are non-demanding at a low double-digit multiple, while leverage is no major concern at all.
 Hence, I see shares as roughly fairly valued here, yet I believe the true long-term outlook remains very sound. Recognizing this is a cyclical stock, shares now largely trade in my neutral zone, yet I feel no action to add to a tiny position, nor feel the need to sell the shares here and now.

All 30 MLB teams will have to make a myriad of adjustments but, as far as Indians manager Terry Francona is concerned, the more important thing is that baseball is back.
   
 Given the green light and a mountain of health and safety protocols to follow, MLB is set to have players report by July 1, spring training 2.0 to begin on July 3 and Opening Day to fall on July 23 or July 24 depending on the team. The league's hope is that it can get through a 60-game regular season and the postseason.
   
 It will be a form of spring training unlike anything those in the game of baseball have dealt with in the past. Teams have 60-man player pools from which to build their 30-man active roster (30 to start the season, then 28 after two weeks and 26 after two more weeks) and reserves between their major- league site and an alternative site.
   
 Teams will have to follow health guidelines and practice strict personal responsibility to remain healthy enough to play the season. Players won't get to play as many minor league games and instead will rely mostly on intrasquad games to prepare for the season. Group sizes are limited. High fives are banned. Francona won't have his normal allotment of bubblegum, though he says he had already started to cut that habit this past spring.
   
 It'll be strange and unfamiliar, but the only course of action, as Francona sees it, is to try to adapt better than the other 29 clubs.
   
 "We've never gone through anything like this," Francona said via a Zoom call on Monday. "We can either look at it that we're coming into August and we're tied for first place with four other teams, or you can shrug your shoulders and roll your eyes and be like, 'Yeah, there's nobody in the stands' and whatever. I can't imagine our guys acting like the second."
   
 Immediately, all 30 teams will be thrown into a shortened season and a tight divisional race. It'll be more of a sprint to the finish. That won't take away any of the shine of a MLB season to Francona, who said he's never come close to the "better than nothing" mindset.
   
 "To me -- I'm sitting in my office today and we're starting to talk about baseball ... -- I'm good to go," Francona said. "If I have to put a mask on, that might even help me. It is what you make it. I went through the '81 season my rookie year and ... they cut the season in half. I don't remember playing in those games thinking, 'Boy, this doesn't mean anything.' I remember being as nervous as could be and thinking that it was the greatest thing in the world. It is what you make it."
   
 Indians president of baseball operations Chris Antonetti said on Monday that unless something unforeseen comes up, all 55 players in the player pool -- the Indians plan to add five more at some point, but chose to submit 55 for now to add some flexibility -- are healthy, ready to go and expected to report on time. The team is still awaiting COVID-19 testing results as players return to the area.
   
 Now comes the difficult task of organizing a compacted spring training utilizing 55 players with limited flexibility and a number of new variables to consider. Francona noted the Indians will start with some simulated games and then graduate to intrasquad games as they prepare for the season. Antonetti added the team hopes to play three exhibition games against other teams at the end of spring training, but that they're still working through the logistics.
   
 "I've never been a big fan of intrasquad games, but we're going to have to become fans of intrasquad games because we're going to need to play," Francona said. "We're just going to try to get our guys ready the best way we know how. And if we have to make changes, we will.
   
 "Again, there's so much to balance right now. It's not just baseball. It's the safety of the players. It's the cleanliness of the clubhouse. It's giving guys time to clean it in between the groups. There are lot of things to think about right now."
   
 An organization staying healthy has become arguably the No. 1 priority. Being better than the opponent on the field each day is one thing. Being able to remain healthy enough to compete is now at the forefront of each team's checklist.
   
 "What's happened in different communities over the course of the past few weeks is a great reminder for us in just how vigilant we need to be because as soon as we let our guard down, the virus has a chance to take hold and spread among our group," Antonetti said via a Zoom call. "We need to make sure we stay diligent and do everything we possibly can to make sure that doesn't happen."

PHOENIX  -- The Minnesota Twins have shuffled their on-field staff to protect the health of some of their older coaches. A trio of players, including Diamondbacks pitcher Mike Leake and Nationals slugger Ryan Zimmerman, have announced they won't be playing in the upcoming 60-game season.  
 As Major League Baseball lurches toward a late July start during the coronavirus crises, it's clear that roster flexibility and organizational depth will be key.  
 The Twins confirmed Monday that bullpen coach Bob McClure and major league coach Bill Evers won't be in the clubhouse at the start of this season because of health concerns. Both coaches are in their 60s and will stay with the organization to help in altered roles.  
 Twins manager Rocco Baldelli, who was sitting in a Target Field dugout during a Zoom call, said he's known both coaches for a long time and that the decisions were difficult. He added that both coaches were disappointed.  
 "I think we all know that we're making the right decision, but that doesn't mean it feels good," Baldelli said. "It's very, very challenging to even think about these sorts of things and have these conversations."  
 But they're exactly the conversations that are being had at both the organizational and personal level across the MLB landscape. The defending World Series champion Nationals will begin their title defense without Zimmerman and pitcher Joe Ross, who both declined to play because of health concerns.  
 "We are one hundred percent supportive of their decision to not play this year," Nationals GM Mike Rizzo said in a statement. "We will miss their presence in the clubhouse and their contributions on the field."  
 Zimmerman, who told The Associated Press last week he was still deciding whether to play this year, ultimately said having three young children, including a newborn, and a mother at higher risk because of multiple sclerosis factored into his decision.  
 "Given the unusual nature of the season, this is the best decision for me and my family," Zimmerman said.  
 The 35-year-old -- who has been with the Nationals since 2005 -- said this does not mean he's retiring. He's still deciding on his future beyond this season.  
 Ross, 27, has five seasons of MLB experience. He appeared in 27 games last season.  
 Zimmerman was due $740,741 and Ross $555,556 as prorated portions of their salaries, originally $2 million for the first baseman and $1.5 million for the pitcher. If they are deemed high risk by team physicians, they would still get paid and receive service time.  
 Arizona's pitching depth took a hit even before the sport's second training period begins later this week. The 32-year-old Leake was expected to be a part of the team's starting rotation after starting 10 games last season and finishing with a 3-3 record and 4.35 ERA following a midseason trade with the Seattle Mariners.  
 D-backs general manager Mike Hazen didn't elaborate on Leake's decision but the pitcher's agent issued a statement saying he made a personal decision not to play during the pandemic. Arizona still has substantial pitching depth with Madison Bumgarner, Robbie Ray, Luke Weaver and Zac Gallen expected to be in the starting rotation.  
 The fragility of baseball's current health situation has been apparent for the past few weeks. The Philadelphia Phillies had a coronavirus outbreak at their spring training facility in Clearwater, Florida, earlier this month. Seven players and five staff members tested positive in the organization.  
 Phillies GM Matt Klentak said the team was "fortunate that none of the cases, player or staff, have been especially serious." He said no one has been hospitalized.  
 But the outbreak is another example of how difficult it is to limit exposure.  
 "What is eyeopening to a lot of us is how quickly it spread even in an environment where we were on the extreme end of caution," Klentak said. "The facility in Clearwater was pretty airtight in terms of staggering times of players reporting to work out, cleaning the facilities in between. Truthfully, it was frustrating to some players how strict it was and yet the outbreak still happened."  
 Boston Red Sox manager Ron Roenicke, 63, said his organization is doing as much as it can to keep everyone -- especially older staff members -- as safe as possible. Cleveland's 61-year-old manager Terry Francona said he's not nervous, even though he's had previous health issues.  
 "I know I'm probably one of the higher-risk guys because of my age and some of the things that have gone on," he said. "But the trainers and the doctors have been terrific. I would rather manage and be around the guys and be around the game than not.  
 "I'd be miserable if I didn't do it."  
 Angels manager Joe Maddon, who is 66, said it's up to individual players and coaches to accept and embrace the safety protocols. There's little doubt the upcoming season will be unlike any other -- if it can be played.  
 "If you want to come in expecting the norms that we're normally accustomed to, then you're going to be frustrated constantly, and you can't permit that to happen," Maddon said.  
 AP Sports Writers Greg Beacham, John Marshall, Rob Maaddi, Tom Withers and Stephen Whyno contributed to this story.

Aunt Jemima is retiring. Uncle Ben is changing. Mrs. Butterworth is getting a review. One way or another, these and other familiar brands are being rethought due to their use of Black images in packaging and ads. Jason Chambers can explain why. He's a professor of advertising at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and studies the history of the business as it relates to African Americans. He spoke with News Bureau social sciences editor Craig Chamberlain.
   
 What's the central objection to some of these brands?
   
 The central objection is their perpetuation of a negative stereotype, a derogatory image. Among these cases, Aunt Jemima is the foremost example. It is the perpetuation of a more-than-century-old stereotype of the African American woman, whether that's in terms of service, appearance or happiness in servitude to Caucasians. It's the perpetuation of a servile image of African Americans and it's been objected to nearly as long as it's been around. It's the perpetuation of an image African Americans would rather not see, and of a name that can be used as an insult.
   
 Complaints against these brands are not new, and yet they've survived. What's driving companies to take or consider more drastic measures now?
   
 It's a combination of the visible social pressure, as well as money - and you could probably reverse those two. In this moment, any brand or organization perceived to be on the wrong side of things in regard to race in America is running a risk of becoming the next great public story. In contrast to earlier moments that relied on mainstream media, social media has changed all that. You can reach tens, hundreds, millions of people as an individual or a small organization to carry these arguments forth. And companies know that. Companies can see the spikes of negative public opinion in the ebb and flow of their brands or their sales, moment by moment.
   
 That is a powerful, powerful motivator that companies have not had to deal with at this level before. Prior to the spread of social media, a boycott took weeks to organize and required a lot of mainstream media attention. You don't need that anymore. A social media story can also maintain a life of its own after the major press has turned back to other issues. It's a motivator to just make the change - boom, and it's done - and not say you'll investigate it, think about it, talk about it, organize a commission to examine it.
   
 Isn't it understandable when companies hesitate to make major changes to a brand?
   
 Every company in this situation has to decide whether it can take the chance and withstand the public scrutiny or outcry and maintain things as they are. But it's a risky proposition. A lot of companies, as nonsensical as it sounds, don't actually know their own history. They have a tendency to look forward rather than back. But a lot of people do look back and if companies have these objectionable things in their history, they may find themselves having to explain away derogatory stereotypical advertisements from their past that they didn't even know existed.
   
 Many consumers also don't want to hear that these decisions are being slow- walked, with the feeling that the company is just hoping the issue will go away. Consumers are responding vastly differently to that now, often expecting an immediate and definitive response.
   
 One response by companies in the past has been to update brand imagery to move it away from problematic origins. Does this ever work?
   
 It depends upon what the image really is, and it depends upon what its original formulation was, what the original story was, and it can begin from there. It also depends on how many layers we're talking about. With Aunt Jemima, for example, it has a historical layer, a visual layer and a named layer. But if you address those things, then you can tell consumers, we've heard you. We've responded to you. And then once you've made those arguments, then you can also remind them why they like your product.
   
 A lot of companies, institutions and organizations have questionable histories in terms of race, but depending upon the changes they make in the present, people can look and say that was part of your past, that was part of your history. But you're trying to change now, so let me watch you and see how genuine those changes are.
   
 You're finishing a book about Tom Burrell, the Chicago ad man who revolutionized how African Americans were portrayed in ads and how they were viewed as consumers, starting in the 1970s. What were the keys to his success that advertisers could learn from today?
   
 A key to success that you could absolutely learn from in any era was his analysis of the consumer market that he was talking to. He had a unique and wonderfully perceptive understanding of the African American consumer market, but he also combined that with a broader understanding and analysis, and a real genius for advertising. He was able to really demonstrate the value of a respectful, uniquely targeted advertising program for African Americans, showing it's not just a nice thing to do, it's not just a smart thing to do, it's an economically valuable thing to do.
   
 Those in the business today can learn from Burrell by asking how they can connect what they know about traditional advertising, branding and marketing with an understanding of African American consumers. There are gaps and areas of opportunity for companies to reach into this market if they can overcome some of their own racial prejudices, or even preconceived notions about what motivates or moves African American consumers, or what engenders their loyalty.

The Iowa Supreme Court in 2018 specifically recognized abortion as a fundamental right, and applied the high standard of “strict scrutiny” to the review of the act at issue, Turner said.
 Planned Parenthood likely will be able to show substantially the same burden of harm to patients subject to a 24-hour waiting period as it did with the 72-hour waiting period, Turner ruled. This could be particularly true now in light of the COVID-19 health crisis, considering the now-blocked law’s requirement for making multiple trips to an abortion provider.

Gerry was an ideal candidate for Rogers’ bear research, as he could actually get close enough to handle the trusting bear, observe her feeding patterns and monitor her heart rate and body temperature.
 Unfortunately, after the research concluded, Gerry became too acclimated to humans, and Rogers feared that she would be put down for being a nuisance bear. Desperate to find a place for the gentle bear to live, Rogers searched high and low for a habitat with ample room in a natural setting.

 Iowa State football coach Matt Campbell -- a graduate of Perry High School -- is helping his assistant coaches offset a portion of the 10% salary reduction they will absorb during the athletic department's temporary COVID-19 salary cuts.
 According to documents the Register received through Iowa's Open Records Law, Campbell's 10% salary reduction between July 1, 2020, and June 30, 2021, amounts to a total of $497,124 -- $350,000 based on the reduction of his average of $3.5 million-a-year salary through Dec 31, 2025, and an additional $147,000 to offset some of the reduction from an assistant coach salary pool.
 Last year, Iowa State spent about $5 million on football assistants. It's unknown how many were asked to take temporary reductions in pay, but an Iowa State athletics spokesman told the Register it was being used to help defray the pay hit to his staff.
 Campbell's gesture was included in documents the Register obtained June 23, including details of a contract amendment Campbell signed in January.
 The basics of that agreement were reported last December, including an extension through 2025 of a deal that pays him an average of $3.5 million a year. That contract included a $6 million buyout if Campbell takes another coaching position.
 The recently obtained amendment includes previously unreported bonuses of $250,000 if Iowa State wins at least eight regular-season games, and $500,000 for nine or more regular-season victories.
 Pollard announced in April that Iowa State coaches and some athletics department staffers would take a pay cut to help the department make up for lost revenue due to canceled Big 12 and NCAA basketball tournaments.
 The plan included a \"one-year, temporary pay reduction for athletics department coaches and certain staff,\" including Pollard.
 The salary cuts were made to help offset a $5 million shortfall the department faced after the cancellation of the Big 12 and NCAA men's and women's basketball tournaments.

The effects of the virus have boosted food delivery, though it hasn't resulted in profits. The market is highly competitive and the margins are slim. The pandemic has also decimated Uber's main business of ride hailing. In recent months, Uber has cut about a quarter of its staff and shed side businesses. Food delivery has been a bright spot for the company as more customers have ordered in, facing widespread restaurant closures.

Reynolds, a Republican, had proposed changing the Iowa Constitution to automatically restore voting rights to felons, but she agreed to instead sign an executive order after Senate Republicans blocked legislative action for two years. Reynolds hasn't given a specific timeline for when she will sign an order or give details about whether felons will need to take additional steps before gaining their voting rights.
