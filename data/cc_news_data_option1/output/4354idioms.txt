 MILTON -- With additional confirmed COVID-19 cases, Milton High School is switching to full remote classes for two weeks beginning Tuesday.
 The school had been holding classes on a hybrid basis, with students attending in-person classes two mornings per week. Hybrid classes are now scheduled to resume on Nov. 10.
 Interim Principal Karen Cahill announced the change in a letter Monday night to the school's staff, parents and families.
 \"Due to the positive cases of COVID-19 at Milton High School and the subsequent quarantine requirements of close contacts, we do not have the necessary staffing in order to keep the building open,\" she wrote.
 The letter did not cite an exact number of cases.
 Milton becomes at least the third area high school now in full remote classes temporarily due to cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. All of Abington schools, including the high school, announced a switch to remote on Monday. And Rockland High School moved to remote classes on Friday after five students were confirmed with COVID-19.
 The high school is also the second Milton school to go full remote due to the virus. The Pierce Middle School reopened Oct. 18 after holding all classes remotely for nearly two weeks due to three COVID-19 cases.
 At Braintree High School, Principal Christopher Scully said an additional member of the school community has tested positive for COVID-19, requiring additional staff and students to quarantine.
 Milton is in its second week in the red zone, or the highest risk designation for COVID-19 cases. A community reaches red status with more than 8 cases per day per 100,000 people based on a two-week average. Milton health officials reported 4 new cases on Monday and 14 in the past week.
 This comes at a time when cases are rising across the state.
 On Monday, Massachusetts had its third straight day of more than 1,000 COVID-19 cases reported around the state. The Massachusetts Department of Public Health reported 1,216 new cases, bringing the state's total of confirmed cases since the start of the pandemic to 148,336. Another 17 deaths were also reported, bringing the state's total to 9,657

With so many benefits to owning an older car, most people would prefer to keep their old car rather than buy a new car. If you think that the gas prices will stay low, then buying a new electric car isn't worth it because you won't save very much money in the long run. Plus, many people have found that keeping their existing cars is easy if the extra money goes towards keeping their vehicles in good condition.

Aspen’ will pay the $25 million to Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ). That money will be deposited into a trust, which will be in the FCDC’s name and dedicated to site cleanup. Frisco will pay an additional $4 million into the same trust to cover additional, estimated costs to remediate the site.
 The city of Frisco will establish a fund to support future maintenance and operation of the site. The city is raising garbage fees $1 per cart, per month, in residential fees and 2% in commercial fees.
 “With the conveyance of the Exide Site to the CDC, Frisco can now assure the proper remediation of the Exide facility which will be a complementary public asset to the Discovery Center and the new Library connecting both of those amenities to Grand Park,” City Manager George Purefoy said. “At build out, the combination of the Exide property, the Discovery Center, Library, and Grand Park covering 600 contiguous acres located in the center of the City will be Frisco’s version of Central Park.
 Purefoy added, “There’s a lot of work ahead, but the end result will be a treasured community asset. This could not have been accomplished without our City Council’s vision for the end goal along with the cooperation and support of the executive, legal, and technical staff of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and the exceptional work done by the Texas Attorney General’s team of lawyers.”

 Auburn might have anyway Saturday at Ole Miss. The play in question occurred on the kickoff after the Rebels took a 28-27 lead with 5:43 remaining. The kickoff bounced in front of Shaun Shivers and into the end zone, but replay showed the ball may have bent back his left pinky.
 Replay officials did re-watch the play after it happened, but did not stop the game for a more thorough review. The SEC said in its Monday statement that they should have.
 "The necessary slow-motion view of the play was not viewed by the replay official to determine if the ruling on the field should have been reversed," the statement read.
 It's not clear what the outcome of the review would have been. Shivers did run after the ball, but as soon as it crossed the goal line, the referee signaled touchback and blew his whistle. Ole Miss recovered the ball after the fact.
 "I asked the side judge 'Why aren't they replaying it? Do I need to challenge?' " Ole Miss coach Lane Kiffin told reporters Monday before the SEC's statement came out. "He said, 'They've already looked at it. There's nothing there.' I'm not allowed to say anything about the conversation but I really wish that our fans and players could hear what I was told."

An eagle-eyed police officer from Melbourne’s outer east helped track down the sister of Private Douglas Downs, whose service medals were stolen during a burglary at his West Footscray home in 1969. Rosemary Bowling, 81, of Yarra Glen, said she ”found it so overwhelming” when Lilydale Sergeant Vaughan Atherton called to tell her they had found her brother’s medals. “It just means so much to have them back and to see them back in the right hands,” she said. “When I got them I was very emotional because to everybody else they’re just medals, but to our family they’re part of our history and it was a history that was lost. “It reconnects us to one another. I was only nine months old when he went to war, so I didn’t know him until after the war, and my sister tells me he was a very different man when he came back.” Sergeant Atherton, who himself served as an Army Reservist for nine years, was chatting to the police station’s property officer when a conversation about war medals “piqued his interest”. Police had not been able to identify the owner of the medals, which had been found during a search warrant at a Lilydale property in 2017, and they were about to be donated to the Returned Services League. Sergeant Atherton asked to take a closer look, and after about two days of intense searching, he was able to track down Ms Bowling. He noticed a name on the rim of the medals and contacted the National Archives of Australia without success before his daughter suggested he search the Department of Veteran Affairs nominal rolls, which provide a snapshot of a person’s service history. That document named Private Downs’s next of kin as his father Egbert Downs – also a navy serviceman in World War I – so Sergeant Atherton went back to the National Archives records to search for Egbert Downs. That search identified Egbert Downs as the next of kin for Robert Griffith Preston Downs, also a WWII serviceman and Douglas’s brother. That led him to the granddaughter of Egbert Downs, Maureen, a Victoria Police employee, who helped put Sergeant Atherton in touch with her aunt, Ms Bowling. She told Sergeant Atherton the medals were stolen during a burglary in 1969. She said Douglas was married and had two sons and a daughter, all of whom had since passed away, so she was his only living relative. “He was most upset when the medals were stolen, but I am beyond excited to have them returned after more than 50 years, and Douglas would be absolutely thrilled,” she said. She said her brother was 21 years old when he served in the Middle East in WWII and managed to escape and fight with the partisans after the Germans invaded Crete before returning home. Ms Bowling said he passed away aged 53 in December 1971, two years after the medals were stolen. She said Sergeant Atherton went “way beyond” what she would have expected to track her down. “Vaughan went to so much effort to get them to us and to trace them because that was not easy,” Ms Bowling said. Sergeant Atherton said police hadn’t been able to identify the offenders who stole the medals in 1969, but it was “never too late”. He said the people found with the stolen medals in 2017 weren’t born when the burglary occurred, so it was one they “might have to work on a bit longer” to crack the case. “Having family who have served in the forces, I know how important these medals are to the people who they are awarded to, and it was important to me to see that they were returned to Douglas’s family,” he said. “I’m just so happy for her and the family that they’ve managed to get them back. Hopefully, they’ll be passed on to younger generations, and maybe we’ll see those kids marching in Anzac Day with them.” Ms Bowling said she hoped to be able to wear the medals to march at Anzac Day next year if coronavirus restrictions allowed commemorations to take place. jack.paynter@news.com.au

There's a brand new horror game on PS4 and Xbox One: the once PC-exclusive Stories Untold. First launched on PC in 2017, Stories Untold went mobile with a Switch release in January. Now you can get it for about $10 on PS4 or Xbox One, and it comes with a remastered version of the first episode.
 Just in time for Halloween, the '80s-themed "narrative-driven experimental adventure game" is a mash-up of different genres separated into four distinct episodes. The House Abandon is a text-based experience where you select from a list of prompts to investigate strange occurrences at the protagonist's family's holiday home. You can see some of The House Abandon playing out in the trailer up top.
 The Lab Conduct tasks you with performing various experiments on a mysterious artifact, The Station Process is a puzzler where you use a radio and microfilm reader to decipher codes for radio frequencies, and The Last Session ties together the events of each episode into one cohesive, and rather unexpected, story. When the game hit Switch earlier in the year, GamesRadar's Connor Sheridan noted how "it goes to some odd and memorable places (both literally and metaphorically)."
 As expected, the PS4 and Xbox One ports of Stories Untold features the same updated interface as the Switch version, which (thank god) means you don't have to deal with some clunky on-screen keyboard.

He was only 7 when he saw his first military coup. He was 15 during the second. Now 21, he is among those at the front of Thailand's growing pro- democracy movement pushing for sweeping political reforms.
 And because of his activities, Bunkueanun Paothong has been charged with crimes that could see him jailed for the rest of his life.
 "I took a stand I know that would be risky," Bunkueanun said. "I stand firm in my principles and beliefs. Because it's the right thing for me to do."
 Fed up with an archaic educational system and enraged by the military's efforts to keep control over their nation, the student-led campaign that began earlier this year has shaken Thailand's ruling establishment with the most significant campaign for political change in years.
 The protesters have three main demands: They want Prime Minister Prayuth Chan- ocha's resignation; changes to a constitution that was drafted under military rule; and, most controversially, reforms to the constitutional monarchy.
 Political protest is nothing new in Thailand, and its past 15 years have been defined by it. Whether it was the red-shirted supporters of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra or his yellow-shirted conservative opponents, some group could be counted on every few years to seize an airport, occupy a government building or blockade a key road in a bid to topple the government.
 And like clockwork, the courts or the military could be counted on to intervene. Prayuth, a former general, first came to power in a 2014 coup.
 But never before have protesters made such open calls for the reform of the monarchy in a country where reverence for the royal institution is inculcated from birth and protected by a law that makes defaming senior royals punishable by prison. The calls have infuriated some, resonated with others and most certainly complicated any solution to the latest crisis.
 "We won't back down, we won't retreat and we won't be open for talks until the government agrees on the three demands," said Chonticha Changrew, who at 27 is one of the more senior protest organizers.
 Many of those on the streets spent much of their lives living under military rule, and those old enough to vote got their first real chance last year. They flocked to a new party -- Future Forward -- whose smart and charismatic young leaders espoused a strong anti-military viewpoint.
 The party shocked the establishment by winning the third-most seats. The military's proxy party was able to cobble together a ruling coalition that put Prayuth back in the prime minister's post. But Future Forward looked like it had room to grow.
 Then in February, the Constitutional Court ruled Future Forward had violated campaign finance laws, dissolved the party and banned its leaders from politics for 10 years.
 The students, already upset at what they saw as an undemocratic constitution that shifted power away from elected politicians to appointed bodies aligned with the military, took to the streets.
 "What motivates the student protesters is that they see the 'game' of politics as being fixed," said Chris Ankersen, an associate professor at New York University's School of Professional Studies Center for Global Affairs, who previously worked with the U.N. in Bangkok.
 The initial protests barely had time to spread before the coronavirus pandemic hit, and the students retreated. They returned in July, when the virus threat eased, and pushed their core demands of new elections, constitutional changes and an end to intimidation of activists.
 The protests gathered steam and took a stunning turn in August, when a few students at a rally aired unprecedented criticism of the monarchy. Using direct language normally expressed in whispers if at all, the speakers criticized King Maha Vajiralongkorn's wealth, his influence and that he spends much of his time in Germany. Among their calls were for greater oversight of royal budgets and an end to the practice of Thai monarchs endorsing military coups.
 While shocking to many, it emboldened others.
 Events escalated on Oct. 14 when protesters heckled a royal motorcade that unexpectedly passed nearby. Security personnel stood between the vehicles and the crowd, and there was no visible violence.
 Nevertheless, Bunkueanun and two others were charged under an obscure criminal statute on committing violence against the queen, who was in one of the vehicles.
 "I was numbed, dumbstruck, and feared for my life," Bunkueanun recalled. He turned himself in to police the next day and spent a day in jail before his release on bail.
 Prayuth and his government responded to the incident and the protests with their tested playbook, declaring a state of emergency for Bangkok that banned gatherings of more than four people and gave authorities other broad powers. That only led to even bigger protests and the government eventually removed the emergency decree to try to ease tensions.
 Prayuth has said he is open to some changes but has maintained that the monarchy should remain off-limits.
 "While I can listen to and acknowledge the demands of protesters, I cannot run the country based on protester or mob demands," he said Monday, opening a special session of Parliament his government called to ease tensions.
 The students' questioning of Thailand's social structure is rooted in their experiences at school, said Thak Chaloemtiarana, a historian who has also been an administrator at Bangkok's Thammasat University and Cornell University in the U.S.
 "The current movement, while led by a handful of university students, has attracted younger students who have become politicized through more news and information from the internet and social media, and spurred by how their teachers and school administrators suppress individualism and exercise authoritarian policies that control dress code, haircuts, gender choice, and ceremonies that are seen as originating from feudal times," he said.
 In addition to political injustices, Thak said, young people were spurred to action by what they saw as the king's accumulation of power and wealth with the acquiescence of the military, as well as the military's needless expenditures during a pandemic-weakened economy.
 The protesters' aim at the monarchy has led to counterprotests by royalists who allege the students are being used as pawns by unidentified powers behind the scenes.
 Unlike previous protests, today's demonstrators are far younger and have no clear links to any group or party, making them appear untainted by past quarrels, said Allen Hicken, political science professor at the University of Michigan.
 The government has so far seemed indecisive about how to deal with the protests, torn between trying to placate or punish those involved. Neither approach has lessened the ardor or number of protesters, who adroitly use social media to organize short, quickly announced events that don't require the infrastructure of past demonstrations.
 Police use of water cannons and chemical irritants against the young protesters this month drew broad public outrage, so it's not clear if the government would push a more violent crackdown like those in 1973, 1976, 1992 and 2010.
 Chonticha is aware history is not on the protesters' side, but she says in some ways they have already succeeded.
 "Our movement has changed the perception of Thais toward the monarchy and military," she said. "If we cannot win this time, we still have planted the seed of criticism of the ruling elite and monarchy in the people's minds."

Misha Green's HBO series, _Lovecraft Country_ , did a great job making me feel uncomfortable through most of its first season. Much of that feeling had to do with the show's treatment of darker-skinned characters. Their story arcs and representation matter because colorism has been a longstanding issue within the Black community — while it also exists as an even bigger universal problem. However, since we were given darker-skinned characters on the screen, I want to focus on their existence, how the characters were affected by their journeys, and what I felt and subsequently had to process as a viewer.

A fire was set Sunday in a Boston ballot drop box holding more than 120 ballots in what Massachusetts election officials said appears to have been a “deliberate attack,” now under investigation by the FBI.
 The fire that was set around 4 a.m. in a ballot drop box outside the Boston Public Library downtown, Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin’s office said.
 There were 122 ballots inside the box when it was emptied Sunday morning, and 87 of them were still legible and able to be processed, Galvin’s office said. The box had last been emptied around 2:30 p.m. on Saturday.
 In a joint statement, Galvin and Boston Mayor Marty Walsh called it a “disgrace to democracy, a disrespect to the voters fulfilling their civic duty, and a crime.”
 “Our first and foremost priority is maintaining the integrity of our elections process and ensuring transparency and trust with our voters, and any effort to undermine or tamper with that process must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,” they said in the emailed statement. “We ask voters not to be intimidated by this bad act, and remain committed to making their voices heard in this and every election.”
 Boston Police said an arson investigation is underway and released surveillance images of a person near the ballot box at that time, urging the public to help identify the individual.
 Officers called to the scene saw smoke coming out of the box before firefighters managed to extinguish the fire by filling the box with water, police said.
 The FBI said in a statement announcing their investigation that “it is a top priority of our offices to help maintain the integrity of the election process in Massachusetts by aggressively enforcing federal election laws.”
 Voters can go online to see whether their ballot was processed. Those who used that dropbox between Saturday afternoon and 4 a.m. Sunday and can’t confirm the status of their ballot online should contact the Boston Elections Department immediately, officials said.
 Voters whose ballots were affected can either vote in person or by a replacement ballot that will be mailed to them, officials said. If those voters don’t submit a new ballot, “their original ballot will be hand-counted to the extent possible,” Galvin’s office said.

It looks like these coming two weeks are going to be like a Dempsey/Firpo, no holds barred brawl between the president and Biden. Thursday evening’s debate gave a preview of coming events. More civility than in the prior debate, the two candidates confronted each other with what appears their respective primary attacks. While Biden focused on what he considers Trump’s gross negligence in the handling of the coronavirus nationally, Trump chose to pursue unverified stories of Biden and his son in relation to China, Russia, and the Ukraine. Trump did well on questioning why Biden and Obama did not accomplish programs now proposed by Biden during their eight years in office as president and vice president. I thought that Biden’s thrust on how Trump has disunified the country and his ostensible support of ultra-conservative militia groups was just as effective. There were other issues of importance including the rush to the Supreme Court appointment with the probability of the Affordable Care Act being declared unconstitutional leaving millions without healthcare benefits, Trump decreeing an end to the withholding of taxes on Social Security that could essentially bankrupt the fund in 2-3 years. I also thought that Trump’s dramatic proclamation that the market will crash and 401ks will be wiped out if Biden is elected president was effective.

The quantum-inspired algorithm in question is known as the wavefunction collapse function. In a nutshell, you have a cube of voxels, a graph of nodes, or simply a grid of tiles as well as a list of detailed rules to determine the state of a node or tile. At the start of the algorithm, each node or point is considered in a state of superposition, which means it is considered to be in every possible state. Looking at the list of rules, the algorithm then begins to collapse the states. Unlike a quantum computer, states of superposition is not an intrinsic part of a classic computer, so this solving must be done iteratively. In order to reduce possible conflicts and contradictions later down the line, the nodes with the least entropy (the smallest number of possible states) are solved first. At first, random states are assigned, with the changes propagating through the system. This process is continued until the waveform is ultimately collapsed to a stable state or a contradiction is reached.
