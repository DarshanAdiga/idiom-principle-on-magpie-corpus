Much of Northern California is going dark as Pacific Gas & Electric preemptively shuts off power to prevent its equipment from starting fires in dry, windy conditions. There are no such shutoffs slated for Monterey County, even with isolated wind gusts in the forecast.
 Firefighters expect to be able to hold the perimeters around the Dolan Fire, which remains 98-percent contained, and the Coleman Fire, which is 70-percent contained. The former has burned nearly 125,000 from Big Sur across the Ventana Wilderness to Fort Hunter Liggett, destroying 19 structures.
 The Coleman Fire has burned 574 acres on Fort Hunter Liggett since it ignited on Oct. 18.
 Fire officials report today, Oct. 26, that even as logs keep burning, "there is no threat to the fire line."
 Yesterday afternoon, the U.S. Forest Service—which is the lead agency battling the Dolan Fire—downgraded the fire from a Type 2 command to a Type 3 command, in anticipation of demobilizing some units later this week.
 Weather conditions are not expected to change those plans. "Wind gusts are expected, but should pose no threat to the fire lines," according to the Forest Service's daily fire report released on Monday morning.

 MILTON -- With additional confirmed COVID-19 cases, Milton High School is switching to full remote classes for two weeks beginning Tuesday.
 The school had been holding classes on a hybrid basis, with students attending in-person classes two mornings per week. Hybrid classes are now scheduled to resume on Nov. 10.
 Interim Principal Karen Cahill announced the change in a letter Monday night to the school's staff, parents and families.
 \"Due to the positive cases of COVID-19 at Milton High School and the subsequent quarantine requirements of close contacts, we do not have the necessary staffing in order to keep the building open,\" she wrote.
 The letter did not cite an exact number of cases.
 Milton becomes at least the third area high school now in full remote classes temporarily due to cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. All of Abington schools, including the high school, announced a switch to remote on Monday. And Rockland High School moved to remote classes on Friday after five students were confirmed with COVID-19.
 The high school is also the second Milton school to go full remote due to the virus. The Pierce Middle School reopened Oct. 18 after holding all classes remotely for nearly two weeks due to three COVID-19 cases.
 At Braintree High School, Principal Christopher Scully said an additional member of the school community has tested positive for COVID-19, requiring additional staff and students to quarantine.
 Milton is in its second week in the red zone, or the highest risk designation for COVID-19 cases. A community reaches red status with more than 8 cases per day per 100,000 people based on a two-week average. Milton health officials reported 4 new cases on Monday and 14 in the past week.
 This comes at a time when cases are rising across the state.
 On Monday, Massachusetts had its third straight day of more than 1,000 COVID-19 cases reported around the state. The Massachusetts Department of Public Health reported 1,216 new cases, bringing the state's total of confirmed cases since the start of the pandemic to 148,336. Another 17 deaths were also reported, bringing the state's total to 9,657

This is a column by Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr.
   
 Ensuring that all Georgians have safe access to food and other essentials has been a top priority for my office from day one of the COVID-19 pandemic. In March, we acted quickly to protect consumers from price gouging and scams by establishing open lines of communications with retailers and other businesses.
   
 Behind the scenes, another issue is worsening, and, unfortunately, many Georgians may unknowingly allow it inside their homes: organized retail crime. Organized retail crime is another name for groups of criminals stealing mass quantities of merchandise from stores and then selling those stolen goods online, and it is a growing problem.
   
 Organized retail crime impacts 97% of retailers in Georgia. Last year, Dunwoody police, who say the bulk of the service calls they receive every day are related to theft, conducted two sting operations in partnership with the Georgia Retailers Organized Retail Crime Alliance that resulted in the arrest of more than 40 people. Home Depot has reported instances of criminals stealing carts full of merchandise, shoving employees aside in the process.
   
 Such criminal activity exposes Georgia retail workers to potentially dangerous encounters, puts consumers at risk of unknowingly purchasing expired and defective goods from online marketplaces and threatens the health and growth of local businesses. In fact, the Department of Homeland Security has warned about the dangers posed to the public.
   
 Organized retail crime is also a kingpin for other criminal operations. The International Criminal Police Organization, or INTERPOL, has said that there is a direct link between organized retail crime and human trafficking, drug trafficking, corruption, bribery and money laundering.
   
 Through many efforts, including our Georgia Anti-Gang Network, statewide law enforcement officials are stepping up to curb this syndicated behavior, and it is important to note that these efforts do more than put bad actors behind bars -- they can potentially save lives.
   
 But despite our success to date tracking down bad actors involved in organized crime rings, there remain loopholes that enable some bands of criminals to go undetected by exploiting lax oversight by online marketplaces.
   
 Congress can help us solve this problem by creating federal standards that prevent criminals from anonymously selling stolen products online and give state law enforcement agencies the information they need to identify who these sellers are and bring them to justice.
   
 One proposed solution [schakowsky.house.gov] lawmakers are considering would make it far more difficult for thieves to fly beneath the radar on online marketplaces. The bill, known as the INFORM Consumers Act, would require those looking to set up accounts on e-commerce platforms to disclose basic information such as their government ID, tax ID, bank account information and contact details.
   
 This would give Georgia law enforcement the ability to quickly and accurately identify criminals and hold them accountable. It is the kind of common-sense solution that will better protect Georgians.
   
 Georgia law enforcement, in partnership with retailers and local businesses, will continue to do everything in its power to protect workers, consumers and local businesses by rooting out organized retail crime wherever it crops up. But, there will continue to be new networks of bad actors so long as they know they can get away with selling stolen goods anonymously online. Congress can help us by passing targeted legislation that closes this loophole.

I chose to keep it simple, like, really, really simple. Because, for me, my Bronco doesn't need all the fancy tech and extra goodies. I want a down-to- earth off-road machine, so I built the working man's Bronco. I haven't seen his yet, but I'm told my colleague Craig Cole built a very similar machine. Great minds think alike.
 To keep my Bronco from looking too rental-car-lot, I painted it a shade of velocity blue to give the SUV a splash of color, but I absolutely needed to keep the 16-inch polished silver wheels. I know, I'd love to have the Sasquatch Package, but man, these wheels are so good. I also added a heavy- duty front bumper and a roof-mounted light bar.
 Inside, it's all stock, all the time. Well, except for the portable fridge/freezer combination Ford offers. I think it'd be swell to have a cold beverage available wherever I decide to park my Bronco out on the trail. I obviously want the seven-speed manual transmission, which left me with the 2.3-liter turbo-four engine, but that's all right. The Bronco's crawler gear will be worth it on the trail, I bet.

Grappling with the Covid-19 pandemic that had hit when the Manohar Lal Khattar-led BJP-JJP coalition regime was struggling to take-off four months after assuming office, Haryana government on Tuesday marked one year in office by inaugurating and laying foundation stones of 306 developmental projects.
 In what was a less than 10-minute oath ceremony held at Haryana Raj Bhawan, Khattar was sworn in as CM on October 27, 2019, on a public holiday on account of Diwali for a second successive term as the Haryana chief minister.
 Dushyant Chautala of Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) was sworn in as the deputy chief minister. The BJP had entered into a post-poll alliance with Dushyant's JJP having 10 MLAs to form the government after the saffron party won 40 seats in the October 2019 assembly elections and was short of a simple majority in the 90-member Vidhan Sabha.
 Even after one year the fate of the much-talked about common minimum programme (CMP) for which the JJP had been pushing is still unknown. A committee was set up to give final shape to the CMP that is yet to see the light of the day.
 Meanwhile, the state government held functions at district level, while chief minister Khattar along with his deputy CM attended a state-level function in Hisar where a 'bhoomi pujan' ceremony was held for the expansion of Hisar airport runway.
 Coinciding with the importance of the occasion, the government on Tuesday resorted to inauguration and foundation stone-laying spree. As per the claims of the government, as many as 306 projects worth ₹1,848 crore across 21 districts of the state were either inaugurated or foundation stones were laid. "While 140 projects completed at a cost of Rs 889 crore were inaugurated, the foundation stone was laid for 166 projects worth Rs 959 crore," an official spokesperson said.
 In his address, Khattar took digs at opposition parties for their remarks over the fate of BJP-JJP government in the state. "The leaders of Congress party had been issuing statements that BJP-JJP coalition government would collapse within three or six months. Nowadays, they are saying that the government would fall after the Baroda by-elections. I would like to thank the Congress party for making such remarks as they help us to remain more cautious while running the government," Khatttar said, pointing out that such statements put a question mark on the credibility of the Congress party.
 The CM said Hisar airport will be developed to enable it handle international flights.
 Deputy CM Chautala was among other dignitaries present on this occasion at Hisar, while the ministers, MPs, MLAs and other prominent people joined the programme in the 20 other districts through video-conferencing.
 On the recent farm laws introduced by the Centre, he said the Congress has been misguiding the farmers. "The farmers are innocent, but no one can deceive them," Khattar said.

ABINGDON -- Kent Jones has a new outlook heading into his 10th season as Abingdon-Avon High School's boys basketball coach.
   
 Jones, who is also the Tornadoes' baseball coach and missed out on the 2020 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic, just wants to take in the journey.
   
 "My perspective has changed a lot with this COVID. My perspective is to enjoy it," Jones said last Tuesday evening after A-Town's basketball workout. "The old adage, 'enjoy it because it might be gone one day.' We've had that happen in the spring.
   
 "I'm just trying to enjoy it and the kids. I'm trying to make it fun for them and not be too hard on them at times -- yet, anyways."
   
 Jones' hoopsters have been getting together for workouts since the beginning of last month, and they'll wrap them up at the end of the week.
   
 And the focus has been mainly on fundamentals.
   
 "Most generally here at A-Town we have a lot of football guys who would be playing football right now instead of coming to open gyms," Jones said. "The one thing I've really enjoyed is working on fundamentals -- passing, handling the ball, defense -- just things that when you only have two weeks to get ready for the season you don't get a lot of time to work on those kind of things.
   
 "Being in the gym adds a little bit of normalcy into life, so we're just trying to enjoy it and not put too many expectations on it yet."
   
 The Tornadoes went 23-8 last winter, and they'll count heavily on the relationships they have with each other in 2020-21.
   
 "We are really leaning on our good chemistry. We've got a really good group of kids," Jones said. "The chemistry is great and they're enthusiastic to be in here. Their attitude has been really good. It's a fun group of guys. They all care about each other. They all want each other to do well.
   
 "When you have that good chemistry, everything else will fall in line after that," he added. "I feel really good about this group. We are very undersized. We're not very deep, but we've got a lot of heart and we have good chemistry. We're going to ride that for as long as we can."
   
 A-Town, like every other high school basketball program in the state, is awaiting word on if games will actually be able to be played once Monday, Nov. 30, hits. The first official practice of the season for all is Monday, Nov. 16.
   
 "Main goal is to just keep preparing. We're preparing like we are going to play. If we just keep preparing and stay on schedule, then we are ready to go," Jones said. "If we don't get to play -- if they do push it back and postpone it -- we will be ready whenever it's time.
   
 "We're just trying to control what we can control. We can't control what the IHSA and governor is going to do," he added. "We're trying to be ready for the season so when they give us the OK we are ready to go."

This is a column by Savannah Morning News Editorial Page Editor Adam Van Brimmer.
   
 Here's the answer to every American's question about when we'll know the 2020 election outcome.
   
 Jan. 5, 2021.
   
 We'll have a president-elect by then. Elections officials will finish counting and recounting mail-in ballots sometime in November. The courts will rule on the inevitable results challenges as soon as possible to minimize any constitutional crisis.
   
 What we won't know before Jan. 5 is who will have won control of the federal government for the next two years, at a minimum.
   
 That will be decided Jan. 5, right here in Georgia, in U.S. Senate runoffs.
   
 You read that right -- runoffs, plural. As in two. As in David Perdue vs. Jon Ossoff as well as the so-called "jungle" contest involving Raphael Warnock, Ed Tarver, Doug Collins and Kelly Loeffler, among others.
   
 The free-for-all race, a special election to fill the remaining two years on retired Sen. Johnny Isakson's term, has long been destined for a runoff. With no primaries to narrow the field, the top vote getter in that 21-candidate quagmire will fall short -- probably well short -- of the necessary majority Nov. 3.
   
 Polls indicate the Perdue-Ossoff contest won't be settled in the general election either. A third candidate, Libertarian Shane Hazel, is attracting enough support that a dead-heat race between Perdue and Ossoff would prohibit either of them reaching the 50%-plus-one-vote threshold needed for victory.
   
 Let's assume for a moment that Hazel pulls 2% of the vote, which is half of what he is currently polling. If Perdue and Ossoff stay close to even, they finish below 50%.
   
 Hello runoff. And hello America -- two runoffs will almost certainly set up a statewide vote for party control of the U.S. Senate, and with it, the federal government.
   
 While many Americans fret about a post-Nov. 3 constitutional crisis around the presidential results, the Senate outcome is the more frightening political apocalypse.
   
 To check or not to check ...
   
 The prospect of single-party control of the presidency, the House and the Senate is real, as Joe Biden leads in the race for the White House, Democrats will retain the House majority and Democratic Senate challengers are polling strongly.
   
 The Senate math goes like this: If Joe Biden wins the presidency and would-be VP Kamala Harris becomes the Senate vote tiebreaker, the Democrats would need a net gain of three seats to claim the majority; if President Donald Trump and VP Mike Pence are re-elected, Democrats would need to flip four posts.
   
 Democrats are expected to lose one Senate seat, currently held by Doug Jones, of Alabama, but hold a solid polling advantage in four races against Republican incumbents elsewhere. However, sitting senators are difficult to defeat -- a couple of those GOP incumbents will lose, but all four? Unlikely.
   
 Such an outcome sets up a monumental runoff election day in Georgia. It would be up to the state's voters to decide whether or not there should be a check on Democratic control.
   
 The Republican narrative about the Democrat's "radical socialist" or "anti- American" agenda is exaggerated. Very much so. It's a scare tactic.
   
 But single-party authority bestows incredible power. We saw that with the Democrat's Affordable Care Act in 2010 and the GOP's Tax Cut and Jobs act of 2017. To think some of the more progressive Democratic ideas won't advance in the Democrats hold the presidency, the Senate and the House for at least the next two years is naive.
   
 Two Senate runoffs to decide party control confers an awesome responsibility on Georgia voters. We'll understand the landscape and what's at stake by then, at least.
   
 Until then, though, the election won't really be settled.

Boosting one-to-one customer engagement is now essential more than ever, especially as brands navigate a pandemic-affected, digital-focused era of remote work, virtual schooling, and social distancing. However, many company leaders concede they overestimated their digital readiness for such a complex effort at this critical time--and still have a lot of work to do when it comes to providing the best-in-class customer experience (CX) that today's buyers expect, especially during a crisis.
 For example, in a recent study, over half of the surveyed leaders (54 percent) admitted they should have done more to help their customers during the current crisis, while over one-third (37 percent) communicated at least one message to customers that was badly received and damaged their brand reputation. In fact, 36 percent said they lost customers during the pandemic due to communication failures.
 Furthermore, organizations know that they have a limited window of time to get up to speed and meet today's customer engagement needs. According to the Pega 2020 Global Customer Experience Study, 58 percent of organizations surveyed believe their CX approach will be outdated in just two years, even while 92 percent say customer-centricity is a top priority.
 The question is, how can companies get where they need to be in terms of customer engagement excellence? What will allow them to compete in an increasingly competitive landscape, where picky customers can quickly transfer loyalties with a mere click if they feel they had a poor experience? How can organizations make sure they provide the personal, consistent, and relevant interactions across all channels that shoppers want from their favorite brands?

 Taking set number five 15-8 the Redwood Valley girls volleyball team remained unbeaten on the season with a gritty 3-2 win over rival Pipestone Area Oct. 22 in a Big South Conference match-up.
 The Cardinals (3-0) have now opened the season with three straight conference wins over Luverne, Jackson County Central and Pipestone Area, with two of those matches going five sets.
 The Cards dropped the first set 25-20 but took the next two by scores of 25-17, 25-15.
 Pipestone would respond to claim set four 25-16, but the Cards would gut it out in the fifth set and win 15-8 to close out the match.
 The return of Kate Ahrens to the line-up proved to be a boost, as she blasted her way to a team-high 20 kills (with 51 attacks) to go along with a team-high 22 digs, two ace blocks and a perfect 13-for-13 serving performance with one ace.
 Sydney Sommers continued her strong play with 11 kills, 18 digs and a 23-for-24 night at the service line with one ace.
 Haley Garman also finished with 11 kills and added two digs and two ace blocks.
 Aubree Hicks led the way with 24 set assists to go along with eight digs, one kill and a perfect 17-for-17 night from the service line.

ARLINGTON, Texas -- If it wasn't exactly redemption for Clayton Kershaw, it sure was for the Los Angeles Dodgers.
   
 Maybe Dave Roberts, too, though the jury will be out on the Dodgers manager until the moment his team finally hoists a World Series trophy.
   
 The Dodgers didn't just win Game 5 on Sunday night to move within a game of doing just that. They also regained the swagger that could have easily been knocked out of them in a demoralizing loss the night before.
   
 They did it by shaking off the effect of a brutal walk off just hours earlier that might have destroyed lesser teams. They did it by getting just enough out of a pitcher whose Hall of Fame resume is lacking only one thing -- a World Series ring.
   
 And they did it behind the chess moves of a manager who makes Dodger fans nervous every time he heads out to the mound.
   
 "I can't get caught up with fan reactions to the decisions I make,'' Roberts said. "I wanted my talent out there and they made me look good tonight.''
   
 A night after Kenley Jansen blew a ninth inning save in a wild finish, Kershaw kept the Dodgers close into the sixth inning -- and this time Roberts pushed all the right buttons. He pulled his starter when Kershaw wasn't in trouble, brought in a string of relievers who did their jobs and -- perhaps most importantly -- left Jansen sitting in the bullpen for the ninth inning.
   
 The Dodgers also scored twice in the first inning, showing they can compartmentalize about what happened the previous night as well as they can hit.
   
 The end result was a 4-2 win closed out by Blake Treinen that moved the Dodgers to within one win of the World Series title that has eluded them since Ronald Reagan was president.
   
 "It's very exciting, but at the same time, we've got to win one more game," Kershaw said. "And so I want to keep it together for one more game. We've got to win one more.''
   
 They'll get two chances to do it, though no one in Dodger Blue wants anything to do with a Game 7 in this World Series. Roberts said he was leaning toward starting part-time starter Tony Gonsolin in Game 6, something he can do with the knowledge he has ace Walker Buehler in reserve for a seventh game, if needed.
   
 But if everything looked rosy Sunday night in Texas, it sure didn't less than 24 hours earlier when Jansen couldn't get the last strike, the Dodgers made two errors on the final play and the Rays fell all over themselves in celebrating an unlikely win.
   
 Turns out short memories are as important as big hits. Max Muncy had both on a night when his most important contribution may not have been the home run that made it 4-2 but his sharp eye in seeing Manuel Margot take off from third base and try to steal home with two outs in the fourth.
   
 Muncy yelled at Kershaw, who stepped off the rubber and threw home to nip Margot in what turned out to be the Rays' last threat.
   
 "Thankfully, I was fortunate enough to see one or two guys in the past attempt something like that on him, so it's one of those things where you know he has that long pause when it comes to his stretch," Muncy said. "You have to be aware of it. Kersh has been doing that for a long time, so thankfully he knew what to do when I ran yelling at him, telling him 'Guy going home.' He didn't panic. He did what he's supposed to do."
   
 Muncy's home run came the next inning, and that was the end of the scoring. Roberts took Kershaw out after only two pitches -- which brought two outs -- in the sixth, drawing boos from the Dodger fans in attendance and disbelief from third basemen Justin Turner, who pleaded with Roberts to leave him in.
   
 But Kershaw, whose postseason struggles are well documented, had struggled all night. And before the inning began, he and Roberts agreed that he would face only two more batters before Dustin May relieved him.
   
 "I didn't have my stuff like I did in Game 1," Kershaw said. "My slider wasn't there as good as it was, so fortunate to get through there. Doc and I talked about it after the inning and I was going to go through Lowe and even though it was just two pitches. So stuck with the game plan."
   
 On this night the plan worked, much to the relief of the noisy Dodger fans who made Globe Life Field seem at least a little bit like home. The Dodgers are now on the brink of their first World Series title since 1988, the year of Kirk Gibson's famous home run.
   
 One more win and the redemption will be complete.

ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — Minnesota voters may be fixated on the presidential race or other high-profile races, but there's an important race on the back of the ballot. Minnesota Supreme Court Associate Justice Paul Thissen is facing voters for the first time since his appointment in 2018. Challenging him is frequent candidate Michelle MacDonald, who is making her fourth bid for a seat on a court that has disciplined her before over professional conduct, and could impose new restrictions on her law license. Both candidates are hoping voters turn over their ballots to the state's nonpartisan judicial races. In 2016, 26% fewer votes were cast for Supreme Court justice than for president. Thiseen, 53, of Minneapolis, served 16 years in the Minnesota House as a Democrat, and was speaker from 2013 to 2015. He made brief runs for governor in 2010 and 2018. He also practiced law for 25 years, arguing cases before appellate courts as a public defender, handling complex litigation for large and small businesses, advising health care and long-term care providers, and providing free services for victims of domestic abuse and families with disabled children. Thissen told the St. Paul Pioneer Press he views his legislative experience as an asset on the court, saying it helps him understand what lawmakers intended when they passed a law that the court considers and gave him opportunities to travel. “One of your jobs as a judge is to step into the shoes of the litigant, to hear their views from their perspective,” he said. “Having traveled to all 87 counties and talked to thousands and thousands of people, I think that experience… helps me do that part of the job.” MacDonald, 58, is a conservative family law specialist from West St. Paul who gets more votes than challengers in judicial races normally do.

They say that DNA matched evidence found after Elizabeth Ann Howell Wilson's body was discovered following her rape and murder in 1976. Coleman got probation and a suspended prison sentence on the gun charges in September. Now he could get a life sentence if convicted.

Portable garages are a fool-proof solution for people who want to protect their cars. It has become extremely easy for the people who treat their cars as lovers to protect and safeguard it from Earth’s natural elements by keeping it under a portable canopy. Leaving the car under the sun and exposing it to extreme climates can lead to the car losing its sheen. Climate change fades the paint of the car and attracts rust formation and mechanical deterioration. The premature ageing can be stalled if they are under the protective covers of a portable garage which will lead to extension of life and good resale value. Portable garages are far easier on the pocket than a permanent garage and are as efficient and can be used for small cars, motorcycles to RVs and minivans and trailers. The best part of the portable garage is it can also be used as party tent when the car is out! It is happy news because everybody surely is a “Party Rocker” from the inside or when the tequila comes out.

The second big new feature is accident detection. We’ve seen this built into smartphones and, in particular, apps like Android Auto, but this is relatively new to the e-bike industry. The Cowboy uses sensors integrated into the bicycle itself and a specially designed algorithm to detect a fall. Once a fall has been identified, the rider has 60 seconds to indicate via the app if everything is okay or not. If there is no reaction, the app automatically sends the last location and a warning message to a selected emergency contact.
 Naturally, Cowboy doesn’t want reviewers taking its €2,290 e-bike and purposely crashing it. To make sure people like me don’t put ourselves in unnecessary danger when testing this new feature, the Cowboy team created a short video showing us how you simulate an accident safely. It basically involves dropping the bike onto a soft surface, like a sofa or cushion, to simulate a fall. It worked well during my test, but this is not really a scientific recreation of an actual fall or dangerous crash.
 The bike uses a unique detection system to identify the many types of accidents you might have when you are out and about. It can also recognize situations that may look like an accident but in reality do not represent one, such as the bike tipping over when parking, or riding on cobblestones. In order to distinguish between the different accident situations, Cowboy says it uses "sensor fusion" to exclude both false-positive and false-negative results. For this purpose, Cowboy uses the following components: a speed sensor in the wheel, the torque sensor to check whether force is being applied to the pedals, and an accelerometer.

She added that the floods were a lesson for those who believe that building more infrastructure is a silver-bullet solution to the climate crisis.
 In the central province where Phuong and Minh scratched out a living, extreme weather is so common that it animates local folk sayings.
 “When it is hot, heaven burns the field like baking stones. When it rains, fields go rotten and sand starts to stink,” is a popular one.
 For years, the couple were too busy to worry much about the weather. He worked construction while she toiled on an assembly line in a garment factory. She also beat breast cancer.
 Last week, when Phuong went into labour, Minh fired up his motorbike, asking his brother-in-law to follow along on a separate bike with his wife’s luggage. When they reached the railway overpass, he hired a boat to take them across a flooded expanse to a taxi on the other side.
 After he climbed out of the boat to retrieve the baby clothes, it tipped his wife into the floodwaters. He was close enough to see her hands waving as the current pulled her under, he said.
 Authorities mobilised a search party of more than 100 people, but it was too late. Phuong’s body was found about 300 feet downstream.
 As of Friday, video of the search effort and Phuong’s funeral had been viewed more than 1 million times, and donations were pouring in for Minh and the couple’s daughter and son, now 12 and 13.
 In a video recorded at the site after the accident, on a patch of road by the water, Minh can be seen bending to the ground in a prayerlike position.
 “Oh my god,” he said. “My darling.”

At the leadership level, the debate over Prop. 16 has fallen largely along partisan lines—nearly every Democratic state legislator voted in favor of putting Prop. 16 on the ballot, while Republicans were generally opposed. The common argument advanced by proponents is that Prop. 16 will promote racial diversity, and therefore combat racism.

Pulling away from a standing start is incredibly fluid. Unlike with some e-bikes where you feel a judder as the motor kicks in, the Cowboy Bike 3 glides as it gets up to speed, whilst maintaining a reassuring feel in the pedals throughout acceleration. A top speed of 25 km/h can be achieved effortlessly, and the motor remains whisper-quiet throughout. There are no gears on the Cowboy Bike 3, but you really don't need them, even when tackling hills. The hydraulic disc brakes do a sterling job as well. The integrated front and rear lights are easily bright enough to ride at night.
 The handling and ride quality is a big win for Cowboy in my opinion, and it’s the single biggest advantage this e-bike has over some of its competitors. Cowboy says the carbon belt drive will last for up to 30,000 kilometers before you need to do any kind of maintenance.

SALEM, OR — Oregon, Washington, and Nevada have joined California's COVID-19 Scientific Safety Review Workgroup, which will independently review the safety and efficacy of any vaccine approved by the FDA for distribution.
 Last week, Governor Newsom announced the panel made up of nationally acclaimed scientists with expertise in immunization and public health.
 “The vaccines currently in development, once approved, are what Americans have been waiting for to protect their families, their children, and their loved ones in long-term care facilities,” said Governor Kate Brown. “The independent review conducted by this panel of doctors, scientists, and health experts will ensure that a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine is available to everyone, especially communities that have been disproportionately impacted by this disease.”
 Governor Brown will join the Governors of Washington and Nevada to identify public health experts that will join California’s workgroup to guide the review of any vaccine approved by the FDA. While there is no proven vaccine for COVID-19 yet, these top health experts will review any vaccine that receives federal approval and verify its safety before California, Washington, Oregon and Nevada will make the vaccine available to the public.
 “California has led with science and data through the COVID pandemic and when a vaccine becomes available, we will leverage our scientific expertise to verify its safety to give everyone the confidence they need to make important decisions regarding the health of their families,” said Governor Newsom. “This virus transcends our borders and we are grateful to partner with our neighboring states though our Scientific Safety Review Workgroup for a healthy and safe path forward for all our communities.”
 “We believe in science, public health and safety. That is why I am pleased that Washington is joining California and other western states in this effort,” Washington Governor Jay Inslee said. “Any COVID vaccine must be guided by the expertise of scientists and medical professionals and that’s just what this workgroup will do. The Western States Pact will continue working together to ensure the best health outcomes for everyone in our states.”
 "Once again, I am thrilled to work with other states in the Western States Pact to ensure we take care of all our residents by bringing together the best and brightest scientific minds across states borders. We know we are stronger together," said Nevada Governor Steve Sisolak. "When the time comes, Nevadans will be able to feel confident in the safety of the vaccine knowing that an independent review by experts across the West gave it their seal of approval."
 This is not the first time Western States have collaborated in response to COVID-19. In April, California, Oregon, Washington, Colorado and Nevada joined in a Western States Pact which shared a vision for fighting COVID-19 and reopening their economies. Western State leaders in May urged congressional leaders to approve $1 trillion in COVID-19 relief for states and local governments and are partnering to pilot a project testing new exposure notification technology pioneered by Google and Apple.

Chandigarh Grappling with the Covid-19 pandemic that had hit when the Manohar Lal Khattar-led BJP-JJP coalition regime was struggling to take-off four months after assuming office, Haryana government on Tuesday marked one year in office by inaugurating and laying foundation stones of 306 developmental projects. In what was a less than 10-minute oath ceremony held at Haryana Raj Bhawan, Khattar was sworn in as CM on October 27, 2019, on a public holiday on account of Diwali for a second successive term as the Haryana chief minister. Dushyant Chautala of Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) was sworn in as the deputy chief minister. The BJP had entered into a post-poll alliance with Dushyant's JJP having 10 MLAs to form the government after the saffron party won 40 seats in the October 2019 assembly elections and was short of a simple majority in the 90-member Vidhan Sabha. Even after one year the fate of the much-talked about common minimum programme (CMP) for which the JJP had been pushing is still unknown. A committee was set up to give final shape to the CMP that is yet to see the light of the day. Meanwhile, the state government held functions at district level, while chief minister Khattar along with his deputy CM attended a state-level function in Hisar where a 'bhoomi pujan' ceremony was held for the expansion of Hisar airport runway. Coinciding with the importance of the occasion, the government on Tuesday resorted to inauguration and foundation stone-laying spree. As per the claims of the government, as many as 306 projects worth ₹1,848 crore across 21 districts of the state were either inaugurated or foundation stones were laid. "While 140 projects completed at a cost of Rs 889 crore were inaugurated, the foundation stone was laid for 166 projects worth Rs 959 crore," an official spokesperson said. In his address, Khattar took digs at opposition parties for their remarks over the fate of BJP-JJP government in the state. "The leaders of Congress party had been issuing statements that BJP-JJP coalition government would collapse within three or six months. Nowadays, they are saying that the government would fall after the Baroda by-elections. I would like to thank the Congress party for making such remarks as they help us to remain more cautious while running the government," Khatttar said, pointing out that such statements put a question mark on the credibility of the Congress party. The CM said Hisar airport will be developed to enable it handle international flights. Deputy CM Chautala was among other dignitaries present on this occasion at Hisar, while the ministers, MPs, MLAs and other prominent people joined the programme in the 20 other districts through video- conferencing. On the recent farm laws introduced by the Centre, he said the Congress has been misguiding the farmers. "The farmers are innocent, but no one can deceive them," Khattar said. Key decisions Parivar Pehchan Patra 'Housing for all' department Foreign cooperation department Citizen resources information department, and constitution of MSME department Every village to have a website 24-hour electricity for 4,755 villages out of 6,700 ₹1,700-crore plan sent to Centre to install 50,000 solar pumps In 6 years, 67 government colleges were opened New medical colleges being opened in Mehandragarh, Bhiwani, Gurugram, Sirsa, Kaithal and Yamunanagar

The timing of this beloved tale couldn't be more perfect as we are transformed to the world of Bedford Falls, NY, where we follow George Bailey as he contemplates ending his life on Christmas Eve. This brings on the intervention of his guardian angel, Clarence, who shows George how different life would be for his wife Mary, his children and his community. Directed by Redhouse Artistic Director, Hunter Foster, this production will feature many of our favorite local actors. The show will be professionally filmed as a 3-camera shoot in the Redhouse's Austin and Allyn Theater resulting in a high quality streaming experience. Since all sound effects in a radio play are acoustic, and tailored for radio, one of the more exciting elements in this production is seeing how these sounds are made. A pair of shoes on plywood represent someone walking in a room; corn starch in a leather pouch represent walking in snow; crinkling cellophane creates a fire effect. The "Foley table", as it's called, will hold over 30 different props, which actors will use to create these sounds. Foster commented, "This story, which always makes me appreciate my own life, couldn't be more appropriate with everything we've gone through in 2020. It's a celebration of life, family, faith and humanity". "We need this show now more than ever." he concluded.

The dependence of India upon foreign countries was made strikingly manifest during the war and manufacturers and public men began to agitate for the adoption of a definite and progressive policy by the Government with a view to improve the indigenous industries and start fresh industries to meet the industrial deficiencies in the country. The appointment of the Indian Industrial Commission was welcomed by the Indian public. But the tardy and half-hearted manner in which the recommendations are given effect to has caused profound disappointment in the country. It is becoming more and more clear that India with all her rich natural resources of raw materials and dormant skill of the industrial classes should find out for herself ways and means for her industrial advancement. Western countries have built up their magnificent industrial structure by the close cooperation of science and capital and by a systematic application of scientific research to industrial problems. The Industrial backwardness of India can be successfully overcome if Indians begin to take, in right earnest, a larger share in the industrial development of their country and establish Industrial organisations on a co- operative basis.

Marlon James’ New York Times bestselling novel “Black Leopard, Red Wolf” has been compared to the world-building works of J.R.R. Tolkien and the Marvel Comics Universe, but his writing and sense of story have a different sense of purpose than both of those fantasy franchises.
 “All my novels have always had supernatural, magical, unexplainable elements,” says James. “I think part of this was searching for my own mythologies. As a Black man born in the diaspora, our ground zero tends to be slavery. And surely there is more to Blackness and Black history and Africanness than that.”
 “Black Leopard, Red Wolf” is, in James’ words, “an old story of the lone hunter, the lone wolf on a mission and interacting [with] a strange land.” It seemed like a departure of styles for James, also winner of the 2015 Man Booker Prize. The author calls his journey into speculative fiction an “evolution” and not so much a genre changeover as a way to reconnect to storytelling.

Washington, (APP - UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 27th Oct, 2020 ) :Democrat Joe Biden was campaigning in the once reliably Republican state of Georgia on Tuesday and President Donald Trump was hopscotching across the Midwest as the US election campaign entered its final week.
 Biden, 77, who is leading in the polls ahead of the November 3 vote, was to hold a socially distanced drive-in car rally in Atlanta, Georgia's largest city.
 Trump, 74, defeated Hillary Clinton by five points in Georgia in 2016 but polls have him running neck-in-neck with Biden in the Peach State.
 Georgia last voted for a Democrat for president nearly 30 years ago -- Bill Clinton in 1992 -- but the Biden campaign has high hopes of switching the state from Red to Blue and also winning the two US Senate seats up for grabs.
 Trump had a hectic schedule planned for Tuesday with a campaign rally in Michigan and two events in Wisconsin, midwestern battleground states which he won by razor thin margins four years ago.
 Trump was to finish the day with a campaign rally in Omaha, Nebraska, in a sign that he expects a potentially tight White House race where every Electoral College vote counts.
 The Cornhusker state is a Republican bastion -- Trump won there by 25 points in 2016 \-- but along with Maine it splits its allotment of votes in the state-by-state Electoral College, which ultimately decides who wins the White House.
 In Nebraska, two Electoral College votes go to the winner of the popular vote in the state while the others go to the winner of each of its three congressional districts.
