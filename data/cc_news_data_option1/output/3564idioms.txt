China and India have been sparring over the area that surrounds the Pangong Tso Lake since the two fought a bloody border war in 1962. The Line of Actual Control, which passes through the lake, was established in the wake of the original conflict. Though it shows up on maps, India and China do not agree on its precise location and both regularly accuse the other of overstepping it, or seeking to expand their territory.
 In 1996, the two countries signed an agreement which states that neither side shall open fire within 2 kilometers (1.24 miles) from the LAC to "prevent dangerous military activities."
 That was among a series of agreements signed by China and India since 1993 to "keep forces at the minimum level at the border" and "shape the behavior of troops," said Indian's Minister of External Affairs Subrahmanyam Jaishankar.
 "If these are not observed, then it raises very, very important questions. At this moment, I note that this very serious situation has been going on since the beginning of May," he said at an event on Monday.
 Both sides adhered to the agreement in a violent face-off in the Galwan Valley not far from Pangong Tso in June. During that dispute, soldiers fought with fists, stones and nail-studded bamboo poles in a bloody brawl that left at least 20 Indian soldiers killed. China has never acknowledged any casualties from that clash.
 The situation was temporarily resolved after the two sides engaged in talks and withdrew soldiers. But tensions flared again last week when Delhi and Beijing accused each other's troops of carrying out provocative actions near Pangong Tso.
 Du Youkang, a professor in South Asia studies at Fudan University in Shanghai, said the warning shots were a "serious" escalation of the border dispute.
 "Both sides have had a consensus, knowing that things could blow up once shots are fired. Even firing into the air should not have been allowed," he said.
 Monday's incident comes as both sides are engaged in high-level talks in a bid to deescalate tensions. Last Friday, the Chinese and Indian defense ministers met on the sidelines at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization in Moscow, and the two countries' foreign ministers are scheduled to meet there on Thursday.
 But Pant, the professor at King's College, London, said he believed tensions on the Sino-Indian border will become a "new normal."
 "The trust has completely disappeared from the relationship ... The LAC is going to be extremely volatile and it will remain so for the foreseeable future unless a permanent resolution to the problem is found," he said.
 "Because the older paradigm, the older frameworks, have completely fallen apart and there are no new frameworks at the moment as the two nations are struggling to come to terms with this reality."

LONDON (AP) — The British government faced pressure Tuesday to act fast to keep a lid on coronavirus infections after a sharp spike in new cases across the U.K. over recent days stoked concerns about the pandemic's prospective path during winter.
 In the wake of figures Monday showing that the U.K. recorded nearly 3,000 new coronavirus cases for the second day running, government ministers and scientists voiced concerns that the easing of the lockdown during the summer has prompted many people, particularly young adults, to let their guard down in a country that has seen Europe's deadliest virus outbreak.
 “This is a big change, it’s now consistent over two days and it’s of great concern at this point,” said Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, the government’s deputy chief medical officer.
 “We’ve been able to relax a bit over the summer, the disease levels have been really quite low in the U.K. through the summer but these latest figures really show us that much as people might like to say ‘oh well it’s gone away’ — this hasn’t gone away."
 While noting that the rise is “much more marked” among young people between the ages of 17 and 21, he said there is a “more general and creeping geographic trend” across the U.K.
 “People have relaxed too much,” he said. “Now is the time for us to re-engage and realise that this is a continuing threat to us.”

The importance of water tends to be overlooked; it has many functions and purposes in everyday life, but psychologically it appeases us much more. In literature, water symbolizes purity, renewal, and cleansing. In the context of the bible, water encompasses all of those tropes and more; it can purify the soul and commence the admission into faith. Hence, the very suitable scenery for Hunter’s newest music video, “Right Now.” She is the centerpiece of the sparkling dockside backdrop, opening her arms wide to give herself to God. Yet, she already has entrusted herself to Him; now it’s your turn. The luminous sky and calm waters are a persuasion in itself to show off God’s work, but Hunter encourages listeners to see the light. The pleasant piano supports her soulful voice, and as she bounces with elation, we can only be reminded of the fulfillment the Lord brings.

En Cisjordania el personal administrativo volvió a los centros de trabajo y los estudiantes seguirán las clases a través de videoconferencias y en número limitado acudirá a los centros cuando la formación práctica lo requiera.


  GAZA, EN ESTADO DE EMERGENCIA


  La franja de Gaza se confinó el pasado 24 de agosto cuando se detectaron los primeros casos locales de coronavirus y el curso escolar de primaria y secundaria, que había comenzado a principios de mes, quedó suspendido.


  Hoy retomó las clases universitarias, con un programa adaptado a la formación en remoto a través de Zoom y otras aplicaciones, según confirmó a Efe el director de relaciones públicas de la Universidad Islámica de Gaza, Saeed al Namrouti.


  Los universitarios iniciaron el curso con cierto escepticismo por las dificultades que los cortes y la escasez de electricidad pueden provocar en las rutinas de trabajo.


  La franja de Gaza, bajo bloqueo israelí desde 2007, cuenta solo con una central eléctrica que intermitentemente deja de recibir combustible cuando aumentan las hostilidades entre Israel y el movimiento islamista Hamás.


  SEMESTRE EN REMOTO EN CISJORDANIA


  En la Universidad de Birzeit, una de las principales de Cisjordania, los estudiantes de Ingeniería y Tecnología, Ciencias, Arte, Música y Diseño recibirán la formación presencial siguiendo los protocolos de higiene y seguridad.


  El Ministerio de Sanidad palestino ha repartido una detallada guía sobre la distancia social entre los alumnos y la desinfección e higiene constantes tanto por parte del personal como de los materiales utilizados en las aulas.


  En total 138.000 alumnos iniciaron hoy el semestre a distancia de las 13 universidades públicas de Cisjordania, y también comenzó el curso, con métodos similares, en facultades privadas y otros centros de formación superior.


  La segunda ola no remite en Cisjordania, que este domingo inició además de forma gradual el curso de preescolar y primaria, y Gaza, que consiguió evitar la pandemia durante los primeros seis meses, no consigue contener el brote.


  El Ministerio de Sanidad informó de 118 nuevos casos en el enclave costero, con un total de 1.269 casos, y nueve muertes, desde marzo de los cuales 1.171 se han detectado fuera de los centros de cuarentena en las dos últimas semanas y siguen activos.

HONG KONG (AP) — China has launched an initiative to address global data security issues, a countermove to the U.S. “clean network” program that is aimed at discouraging other countries from using Chinese technology.
 Foreign Minister Wang Yi announced the initiative in Beijing on Tuesday at a seminar on global digital governance.
 He said mounting risks for cyber security threaten national security, public interests and personal rights.
 The move comes amid a deterioration in U.S.-China relations encompassing trade tensions and competition in telecommunications and artificial intelligence technologies, with the U.S. accusing Chinese technology companies of threatening American national security.
 “Bent on unilateral acts, a certain country keeps making groundless accusations against others in the name of ‘clean' networks and used security as a pretext to prey on enterprises of other countries who have a competitive edge,” Wang said, according to a transcript of his speech released by the ministry. “Such blatant acts of bullying must be opposed and rejected.”
 Wang said that it was important to develop international rules on data security that will “reflect the will and respect the interests of all countries through broad-based participation.”

It’s a secretive industry, so old growth logging happens with little oversight or accountability. The only thing that can stop it is an aerial blockade by activists willing to hike the roads, often over 10 miles, then climb up into the trees with equipment to survive in the canopies for long enough to disrupt the loggers’ plans.

If you walked into Barnstable's Sturgis Library one afternoon last week, you'd have seen a patron browsing the fiction section, another paying for a book- sale find, and two young girls carrying stacks of stories to discover.
 At Osterville Village Library, you'd have seen a man perusing the DVD selection, and two 20-somethings working on computers at separate tables.
 They were all masked. Librarians were behind plexiglass. At Sturgis, yellow arrows designated a path. But everyone was inside a library.
 Since the pandemic first forced shutdowns in March, officials at Cape Cod's more than 30 libraries have tried to offer a wide variety of services. First, it was virtual programs, and access to ebooks, online movies, courses and other data.
 By early summer, help grew to curbside pick-up of ordered books at most locations -- with books quarantined for 72 hours between people touching them. Some librarians will do research, print out papers, or make copies. Staffers can be consulted for picks for all ages and interests.
 "The building is closed to the public, but (library services) are very much open," said Amy Raff, Provincetown Library director. Staff tries "to do everything we can do … to replicate what people can do in a library."
 But a half-dozen Cape libraries in recent weeks have quietly reopened at least parts of their buildings.
 The four in Barnstable -- Sturgis, Hyannis, Cotuit and Osterville Village -- and the Yarmouth Port Library are independent, nonprofit libraries, funded largely through donations and grants, with leaders making decisions independently. Sandwich Library has partially reopened with the blessing of town inspectors.
 State officials allowed libraries to be "open with browsing" as of July 6. That was if COVID-19 safety protocols and standards could be met, including building size and layout for social distancing.
 Cape towns and librarians interpreted that capability differently, and have been comfortable with varying degrees of service to ensure staff and patron safety. Most buildings remain closed -- some by town order -- but with librarians able to help remotely.
 The half-dozen reopenings have been a measured process, with strict, frequent cleaning regimens and rules. How much of the building is open varies, as do hours and what "browsing" means -- some require hand-sanitizer before touching books, some require gloves, some don't allow patrons to touch anything they're not taking home.
 In Hyannis, Cotuit and Sandwich, only lobby areas are open, but with shelves of books (new and staff picks) for browsing. If you ask, staffers can look in the book stacks for you. Rather than "say 'you can't do this,' we try to offer a solution," noted Sandwich director Joanne Lamothe. Hyannis also offers computer access (with gloves provided) and access to copy and fax machines.
 At Yarmouth Port, Sturgis and Osterville libraries, patrons can move between rooms to browse stacks themselves. And in Osterville, you can stay awhile and use the computers, for important tasks like job searches or housing issues.
 The general reaction? "People are surprised and happy" to find the library open, said Sturgis library director Lucy Loomis. "People came back slowly. Now it's pretty steady and everybody loves it. We also wanted to make sure the staff feels comfortable."
 "Most patrons are thrilled," agreed Antonia Stephens, Cotuit library director. "There are people who used to come in several times a week, if not every day. They're just happy to see us and we're happy to see them."
 Yarmouth Port head librarian Leslie Altman noted many patrons live on their own, so "might not have talked to people very much. … For us, (the library) is as much a community center as getting books." One visitor now comes in daily to read the New York Times, but Altman said he's usually the only person there.
 No libraries reported problems exceeding capacity limits, and some have one door to enter and a second to exit. Most encourage people "to be efficient" -- there's a 20-minute limit in Hyannis, an hour at Sturgis, only four people allowed at a time in Cotuit. Sturgis staff removed chairs and toys to encourage a "grab and go rather than sit and stay" policy.
 But Osterville has raised reopening to a different level.
 Protocols are strict, hand-sanitizer offered, cleaning stations set up around the library (for visitors to help sanitize), room-capacity limited and furniture well-spaced. That's all been done toward the goal of getting the library as open as possible seven days a week to serve a variety of needs.
 "We felt, for people's mental health, that having something be somewhat normal would become very important," said executive director Cyndy Cotton. "Some people don't have access to the internet, computers or air conditioning. It's a hard-enough time for people mentally. We want to be there in any way we can to help."
 The building has hosted blood drives, plus tax preparation for 300 people. Osterville staff bought elementary, middle and high school databases for students and other help for home-schoolers. Cotton plans to accommodate parents who do pod learning, as well as allow students to take virtual courses at the library.
 It's all been a challenge, she acknowledged, and services expanded slowly as staff comfort level grew. Closing time was set at 4:45 p.m. to give staffers some "time to chill before we get on our way," she said. "Now we're in a good routine, though. We have our (cleaning and protocol) checklists and we just do it."
 With the days of patrons "hanging out," holding meetings or crowding the stacks in a library -- Provincetown's can have 650 visitors on a summer day -- in the unforeseeable future, Cape librarians in open and closed buildings are assessing what staff and patrons feel comfortable with for coming months.
 Trying to work in tandem, Outer Cape librarians haven't yet set a date for reopening buildings, Raff notes, and with the pandemic, "we're living in a sea of uncertainty."

On Tuesday, the office shared a position paper on the annual assessment of the Swiss-US Privacy Shield: a mutual agreement that includes stricter data protection for participating companies. This ensures that certified American companies respect Swiss data protection legislation and vice versa. It also addresses the processing of data of non-US citizens for anti-terrorism and national security purposes.
 In his latest assessment of the Shield, the data protection commissioner concluded that “although it guarantees special protection rights for persons in Switzerland, it does not provide an adequate level of protection for data transfer from Switzerland to the US pursuant to the Federal Act on Data Protection”.
 Unlike the European Union - and countries like Canada, New Zealand, Uruguay and Argentina - the US was never on the Swiss list of countries whose legislation could be considered to provide adequate data protection. However, to help simplify data transfer between the two countries the US was placed on a list of those with “Adequate protection under certain circumstances”. On Tuesday, the Swiss authorities announced that they were removing the US from this list.
